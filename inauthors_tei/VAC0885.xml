<p>During the years from 1861 to 1865, one of the
greatest wars in all history was fought in this country.
There were in all three million three hundred and
seventy-eight thousand men engaged in the fighting
of it.</p>
<p>There are not that many men in all the regular
standing armies of Europe combined, even if we include
the unpaid hordes of Turkey and the military
myriads of the armed camp known to geography
as Russia.</p>
<p>The actual fighting field of this war of ours was
larger than the whole of western Europe, and all of
it was trampled over and fought over by great armies.</p>
<p>The men killed or mortally wounded in our war
numbered on the Northern side alone 110,000. The
total number of deaths resulting from military operations
on the Northern side alone was 350,000. The
figures for the Southern side are not accessible, owing
to the loss of records. But as the fighting was
equally determined on both sides, and as other conditions
were substantially equal, it is certain that the
losses of life were relatively about the same on both
sides. It is well within the facts, therefore, to say
that this war of ours directly caused the death of
more than half a million men. No other war in

<pb id="VAC0885-010" n="4"/>
                            
modern history has cost so many lives or half so
many.</p>
<p>We hear much of our recent war with Spain. Let
us take it as a basis of comparison. The total number
of men even nominally called into the field in that
war was less by nearly two to one than the deaths
alone during the Confederate war. The number of
men who were actually engaged in the Spanish war
numbered only about one tenth as many as those who
were buried as victims of the Confederate war's battle
fields.</p>
<p>Again, the total number of men killed and wounded
during the Spanish war--including every man who
was touched by a bullet or scratched by a sword or
bayonet thrust or hurt by a splinter at sea--was only
two hundred sixty-eight. That is fewer than the
number who were stricken in each of many before-
breakfast skirmishes of the Confederate war, some
of which were deemed too insignificant to be reported
to headquarters with precision.</p>
<p>Looking for higher standards of comparison, we
find that 43,449 men fell killed or wounded at
Gettysburg alone. That is almost double the loss
of the allied forces at Waterloo and probably equal
to the total losses on both sides at that greatest and
most decisive of European battles.</p>
<p>There were more than a dozen other battles of the
Confederate war which in slaughter fairly deserved
comparison with Waterloo. These included the
Seven Days' battle before Richmond, and the battles
of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Antietam, Shiloh,
Chickamauga, the Wilderness, Spottsylvania, Cold

<pb id="VAC0885-011" n="5"/>

Harbor, the Second Manassas (or Bull Run), Stone
River, Petersburg, Franklin, Lookout Mountain,
Nashville and several others.</p>
<p>Still another measure of the magnitude of a war is
its duration. It is duration indeed that chiefly determines
the amount of human suffering caused by
a war, especially to the women and children who are
war's chief victims.</p>
<p>Measured by this test of duration the Confederate
war exceeded all other recent conflicts in the magnitude
of the suffering it inflicted.</p>
<p>Its first gun was fired at Fort Sumter in April,
1861: its last armed conflict did not occur until
May, 1865. Thus for four years and a month the
war endured. The Crimean war--one of the longest
of nineteenth century conflicts--endured for less than
half that length of time and the actual fighting of it
lasted less than one fourth as long. The duration of
the Confederate war was seven times as great as
that of the stupendous Franco-Prussian conflict of
1870, which overthrew the second Napoleonic empire,
consolidated Germany and made the republic an enduring
fact in France. It was twenty-four times
as long as that of the French-Austrian war, which
set Italy free, or as the War of 1866 between Austria
and Prussia which laid the foundations of the present
German empire.</p>
<p>Measured by its end, ring consequences the superior
magnitude of our war in its influence upon national
and human destinies is still more conspicuous.</p>
<p>It made an end of human slavery in the last civilized
country on earth in which slavery was permitted.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-012" n="6"/>
                            
<p>It freed the nation from a reproach that sorely
afflicted its citizens.</p>
<p>It ended a political conflict which had threatened
the very foundations of the Republic from the hour
of its institution.</p>
<p>It freed the Southern States of the Union from
an incubus that their statesmen and their best citizens
had for generations desired to be rid of, an incubus
that had restricted their development and retarded
their growth in wealth and population as no other
evil influence had ever done in any part of our
country.</p>
<p>Still more important so far as human history is
concerned, this war of ours settled at once and forever,
the vexed and vexatious questions of constitutional
interpretation that had beset the Republic from
the hour of its formation.</p>
<p>It revised the constitution upon new lines and reconstructed
the Republic in ways that promise permanence.</p>
<p>As an exhibition of national military capacity
and a revelation of our prodigious possibilities of
armed resistance, it taught the world the advisability
and indeed the absolute necessity of letting the
United States alone, as the one unassailable and defensively
irresistible nation on earth.</p>
<p>Finally it gave to the American people a realizing
sense of their own limitless r ewer, which has both
strengthened and sobered the popular mind, revealing
to it the nation's limitless ability to work iniquity,
and awakening it to the Republic's nobler capacity--
to work righteousness instead.</p>


<pb id="VAC0885-013" n="7"/>

<p>The conflict so far exalted and emphasized the
power of the Republic as to inspire us with a new
generosity of forbearance in our dealings with all
other nations. It made it easy for us to follow
General Grant's rule of right to "deal with other
nations as enlightened law requires individuals to deal
with each other."</p>
<p>Incidentally this war exhausted and impoverished
the South as no other war ever exhausted and impoverished
any fruitful land. It utterly destroyed
the labor system of those states. It put out the light
of their prosperity for a time and left their people
blindly groping for sustenance. It destroyed a social
fabric of exquisite poise and picturesqueness which
had endured from the beginning of American colonization.
It set society upon its head in the South and
replaced historic order with inexpressible chaos. For
a time it substituted for a traditional government by
the best, an actual and very lawless government by
the worst elements of society, exalting ignorance
above culture, vice over virtue, and setting a horde
of half-savage and suddenly emancipated slaves to
direct the destinies of a region to which the country
had always reverently looked for exalted patriotism
and the wisest statesmanship--the region which had
produced Washington and Jefferson and Madison
and Monroe; the region that had given to the Republic
that greatest and wisest of the jurists of the modern
world, John Marshall; the birthplace of Patrick
Henry, and George Wythe and George Mason and
Henry Clay.</p>
<p>Anarchy and chaos and an era of unspeakable disorder


<pb id="VAC0885-014" n="8"/>
                            
succeeded the war as its inevitable consequence
and when at last a new order was wrought out of
these disturbed conditions, all that was characteristic
of the old South had completely passed away. A
new era had dawned, coming as a posthumous birth
of the conflict of arms.</p>
<p>A revolution had been wrought in the social, industrial
and economic conditions of a fair land. It
brought with it a new material prosperity greater
than any that had ever been dreamed of in that region
before. It led to the development of resources that
had lain dormant for generations. In agriculture
alone, the South produces now many times the wealth
each year that had been dug out of her fields under
the old system. The very greatest cotton crop that
was ever grown before the war amounted to 4,669,770
bales; since 1877 no crop so small has been grown
in any year, while in recent years the crops have
reached the stupendous total of more than 12,000,000
bales in each year.</p>
<p>Thus the old staple industry has doubled and trebled
its productiveness under the influence of the new
industrial conditions created by the war and by the
social and economic revolution which the war wrought.</p>
<p>But this is a small part of the matter. Greatly
as the yield of cotton has been multiplied under the
new conditions, cotton has ceased to be king even
in the land over which it once exercised undisputed
sway. Other and humbler agricultural products--
never thought of in the old planting days as money
crops--have come, in their value to rival cotton itself
as a source of enrichment to Southern agriculture.</p>


<pb id="VAC0885-015" n="9"/>

<p>More important still, the new conditions that were
created in the South as a result of the war have
led to the development there of resources of inestimable
value which were wholly neglected under the old
system. The little, local, loitering railroad lines of
the older time have been combined and extended and
upbuilt into great arteries of travel and traffic. Prairies
that were scratched over for the sake of meager
cotton crops of half a bale to the acre have been
delved under for coal and iron. Industrial cities of
importance have arisen where cabins remotely stood.
Blast furnaces have replaced the breezes that once
alone disturbed the broom-straw grass. Iron foundries,
steel mills, machine shops, coke ovens, rolling
mills and the like employ men by tens of thousands
where before only a few hundreds compelled the reluctant
soil to yield them a precarious living. The
still unsubdued pine lands are dotted all over with
cotton mills which give work and wages to a multitude
and the magnitude of their dividends strongly
tempts capital to a like investment elsewhere in the
country that was once abundantly content to produce
a raw material and to buy back the finished products
of it from factories hundreds or thousands of miles
away.</p>
<p>The harbors of the South, once mere ports of call
or refuge for a shipping that belonged elsewhere,
have become the seats of great shipbuilding and ship-
owning enterprises the productiveness of which is
loosely reckoned by imperfectly counted millions.</p>
<p>Still again, under the new conditions resulting from
the war, great industries have sprung up in the South

<pb id="VAC0885-016" n="10"/>
                            
which find both their profit and their reason for being
in the utilization of things that were sheer waste under
the old system. The manufacture of cotton seed
oil and its rich by-products is the best illustrative example
of this. It employs thousands of well paid
workmen and millions of well remunerated capital
in converting into very valuable products the cotton
seed that was once utilized only as a fertilizer for half-
exhausted soils.</p>
<p>In brief, the political and social revolution wrought
by the war is matched and over-matched by the stupendous
economic revolution produced, a revolution
whose rewards to industry, to capital and to enterprise
are such as the wildest visionary would have
laughed at as a futile dream when the South lay
stripped and stricken and staggering under its burden
of perplexities at the end of a struggle which had
taxed its material resources to the point of exhaustion
and which had well-nigh exterminated its vigorous
young manhood.</p>
<p>It is to tell the story of a war thus stupendous in its
causes, its events and its consequences that this book
is written. There is nowhere in history a story more
dramatic, more heroic or more intimately inspired
by those emotions that control human conduct and
work out the events of human life. The endeavor in
these volumes will be to relate that story with absolute
loyalty to truth.</p>
<p>The writer of these pages is persuaded that the
time has fully come when this may be acceptably
done; that the time has passed away when any American
of well ordered mind desires the perversion or

<pb id="VAC0885-017" n="11"/>

the suppression of truth with respect to our war history.
There is certainly nothing in that history of
which any part of the American people need be
ashamed.</p>
<p>The great actors in the drama have all passed away.
The passions of the war are completely gone. Even
in politics, war prejudices no longer play a part
worth considering. The time seems fully come when
one may write truth with regard to the war with
the certainty of a waiting welcome for his words.
The time has come which General Grant foresaw
in 1865, when he predicted that the superb strategy
and unconquerable endurance of Lee and the brilliant
military play of Sherman, the splendid prowess of
Stonewall Jackson and the picturesque achievements
of Phil Sheridan, the extraordinary dash and enterprise
of J. E. B. Stuart on the one side and of Custer
on the other, would all be reckoned a common possession
in the storehouse of American memory, a
subject of pride and satisfaction wherever there might
be an American to glory in the deeds of his countrymen.</p>
<p>The time has come when the prowess of the American
soldier, equally on the one side and upon the
other, his measureless courage, his exhaustless endurance,
his all-defiant devotion to duty, his extraordinary
steadiness under a fire such as few soldiers on earth
have ever been called upon to face, his patience under
long marchings, starvation and every circumstance
of suffering, are subjects of justly indiscriminate admiration
on both sides of a geographical line long
since obliterated.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-018" n="12"/> 
                            
<p>The story of Pickett's charge at Gettysburg may
now be told to Northern ears as surely sympathetic
with the heroism shown in that world-famous action
as are any ears at the South. The heroic tale of the
Federal assaults upon Marye's Heights at Fredericksburg
where brave men, knowing the futility of
their endeavors, obeyed orders and went to their
deaths by thousands because it was their duty to do
so may now be told to listening Southern ears with
as absolute certainty of applause as if the story
were related only to veterans of the Army of the
Potomac.</p>
<p>"East is East, and West is West" writes Kipling
in one of his finest ballads in celebration of generous
personal courage. Paraphrasing, we may say:
"North is North and South is South," but courage,
heroism, devotion and a generous chivalry belong to
no time and no country exclusively. They are the
common possessions of all worthy manhood. Like
the gold beneath the guinea's stamp they pass current
wherever coined because their value is inherent.</p>

<p>The war of 1861-65 was in fact a revolution.
Had the South succeeded in the purposes with which
that war was undertaken it would have divided the
American Republic into two separate and independent
confederations of states, the Union and the Southern
Confederacy. The North having succeeded, no such
division was accomplished, but none the less was a
revolution wrought as has been suggested in the
introductory chapter of this work.</p>
<p>Familiarly, and by way of convenience, we are
accustomed to call this "The Civil war," in contra-
distinction from those other wars in which the American
power has been arrayed against that of foreign
nations. But the term "Civil war," as thus applied,
is neither accurate nor justly descriptive. In all
that is essential to definition this was a public and not
a civil war and it is necessary to a just understanding
of the' struggle and its outcome to bear this fact in
mind, Otherwise the entire attitude and conduct of
the Federal government toward its antagonist must
be inexplicable, inconsistent and wanting in dignity.</p>
<p>The Southern States asserted and undertook to
maintain by a resolute appeal to arms, their right to
an independent place among the nations of the earth.
In the end they failed in that endeavor, But while

<pb id="VAC0885-020" n="15"/>
                     
the conflict lasted they so far maintained their contention
as to win from their adversary a sufficient
recognition of their attitude to serve all the purposes
of public rather than civil war.</p>
<p>They instituted and maintained a government,
with a legislature, an executive, a judiciary, a department
of state, an army, a navy, a treasury, and
all the rest of the things that independent nations set
up as the official equipment of their national housekeeping.</p>
<p>Not only did foreign powers recognize their right
to make war, not as rebels but as legitimate belligerents
entitled to all the consideration that the laws of
civilized war guarantee to nations, but the United
States government itself made similar recognition
of the South's status as a power possessed of the right
to make war.</p>
<p>At the outset there was quibbling of course, and
a deal of playing for position. But in view of the
obvious facts all this quickly gave way to a perfectly
frank recognition on both sides of the truth that there
was legitimate public war between the North in the
name of the Union and the South organized as the
Southern Confederacy; that the struggle involved
the question of the independence of the South on the
one hand and the indissolubility of the Federal Union
on the other; that the conflict was the result of an entirely
legitimate appeal to arms for the decision of
questions which no other arbitrament could decide;
and that the contest must be fought out not as a
struggle between constituted authority on the one
hand and    insurrection  on  the  other but as a

<pb id="VAC0885-021" n="15"/>

controversy between two powers, each of which was
legitimately entitled to assert its contentions and to
maintain its attitude by every means known to
civilized war.</p>
<p>All this was reflected, while the war lasted, in the
treatment of men captured on either side as prisoners
of war; in negotiations for the exchange of prisoners
with full recognition of military rank on either side;
in the issue, the observance and the enforcement of
paroles; in safe conducts frequently granted and
always honorably respected; in agreements for the immunity
from arrest of medical officers and other non-
combatants; in the humane and civilized arrangements
made between opposing generals for the equal care of
the wounded of either army by the surgeons of both,
and in a score or a hundred other ways.</p>
<p>And when the war was over both sides fully recognized
and emphasized its character as a legitimate
public war and not in any respect as an insurrection.
When the broken fragments of the organized armies
of the South surrendered, there was an end of the
controversy. The Southern people made no effort
to prolong the struggle in irregular ways, as they
easily might have done. They set their faces against
all attempts to inaugurate a guerilla warfare, a thing
which would have been easy to them. Under the advice
of General Lee and their other great leaders the
soldiers of the Confederacy accepted the surrender of
the Confederate armies as a sovereign act that made
an end not only of the war but of their right to make
war. By their immediate return to ways of peace
and by their sincere acceptance of the terms offered

<pb id="VAC0885-022" n="16"/>
                    
in Mr. Lincoln's promptly issued amnesty proclamation
they marked and emphasized their view that they
had been engaged, not in a disorderly insurrection,
but in a legitimate, public war, the military end of
which marked the end of their right to carry on
hostilities of any kind or character.</p>
<p>Equally on the other side, the public character of
the war was recognized by every act of the government.
There was not even one prosecution for treason.
Congress imposed upon the Southern States definite
legislative duties as a condition precedent to the readmission
of those states to the Union, thus emphatically
recognizing the fact that during the progress
of the war they had actually been out of the Union,
and could be readmitted to it only upon terms prescribed
by a congress representing those states which
had remained in it. In these and a hundred other
ways-and especially by means of that long military
occupation of the South which ended only under the
Hayes administration-the national government recognized
the fact that there had been a legitimate
public war between the two sections and not merely
an insurrection with the military operations necessary
to its suppression.</p>
<p>A failure to recognize these things would have been
absurd and ridiculous in an extreme degree. It
would have been to ignore the most obvious facts in
modern history and to substitute a lot of lawyers'
quibbling prevarications for the modern world's greatest
wonder story of war. It would have been to regard
a dozen or twenty of the greatest battles ever fought
on earth as the conflicts of a sheriff's posse with 

<pb id="VAC0885-023" n="17"/>

turbulent gangs of rioters. It would have been to treat
as merely disorderly outbreaks and operations for
their suppression, the great military campaigns which
have passed into history as superbly illustrative, on
the one side and upon the other, of all that is most
brilliant in strategy and all that is most heroic in
endeavor and in endurance. It would have been to
discredit the national defense by belittling the occasion
for it. It would have been to rub off the tablets
of human memory equally the achievements of Grant
and Meade and Sherman and Thomas and Farragut
and the rest, and the record of what Lee and Jackson
and Beauregard and the two Johnstons and Stuart and
Early and Longstreet had done. It would have been
to rob the nation of the credit it had won in the most
strenuous conflict in which it had ever been engaged
and of the glory of the genius and the heroism manifested
by Americans upon either side. It would have
been a perversion of history, a degradation of great
deeds, a reckless wasting of the Nation's accumulated
store of cherished memories of heroism.</p>
<p>We must bear these truths in mind if we are rightly
to understand the great struggle which for convenience
and quite incorrectly we call the Civil war. We
must remember that it was a struggle of giants; that
it was a conflict between two powers, each of which
was possessed of a tremendous fighting capacity; that
it called forth the most brilliant strategy of modern
times that it was inspired on both sides by a heroism
worthy of celebration in song by the most gifted of
ballad-makers; that it involved the very vitals of republican
self-government among men; that it wrought

<pb id="VAC0885-024" n="18"/>
                     
a revolution more stupendous, more far-reaching
and more lasting in its effects than any other in recorded
history; that it overthrew old institutions and
created new ones in their stead; that it reversed the
history of a hundred years; that it wrote anew the
fundamental law of the greatest nation of all time;
that it created a new epoch and made a new national
power the dominant force and influence in the ordering
of human affairs.</p>
<p>Only by such appreciation of the nature, the magnitude
and the significance of our war, shall we justly
estimate its place in the record of human affairs or
properly understand the meaning it is destined to
carry with it into history.</p>
<p>It is with an abiding conviction that the story of
this war is the most precious memory of all the American
people, the record of their highest achievements,
the supreme demonstration of their right to a foremost
place among the peoples of the earth that this
telling of that story is undertaken.</p>

<p>The causes of the war of 1861-65 were deeply imbedded
in the history of the country, in the peculiar
manner of its development, in the complex interests
of men, and in those primary instincts of human
nature which account for everything but which are
themselves often unaccountable.</p>
<p>It is difficult, indeed it is impossible to trace and
unravel to the full the influences which in 1861
brought the North and South into armed conflict
and created a war of stupendous proportions between
men who had for generations rejoiced in a
common heritage of liberty; men who had cherished
alike the memory of Bunker Hill and Yorktown;
men who had worshiped the same household gods
and honored the same heroes as their national demigods;
men to whom the history of the Republic was,
to all alike on both sides, the story of their fathers'
and grandfathers' heroic deeds.</p>
<p>Yet if the historical event of 1861 is to be at all
adequately understood or interpreted, the historian
must in some degree at least discover the conditions,
near and remote, that gave occasion for the strange
catastrophe.</p>
<p>There is a short and easy method of dealing with
the matter as there always is a short and easy method


<pb id="VAC0885-026" n="20"/>
                    
of solving historical puzzles by referring them to
some complex cause and treating that cause as a
matter of the utmost simplicity. It is easy to say
that the war of 1861-65 grew out of slavery; that slavery
existed and was defended at the South while
it was antagonized at the North, and that the conflict
arose out of that. But no reader of intelligence is
satisfied with such a reference as a substitute for explanation.
Every such reader knows not only that
the great and overwhelming majority of Northern
people in 1861 would have angrily rejected a proposal
that the nation should wage a war for the
extermination of slavery in the states in which it
legally existed. Every reader who is in the least instructed
in the history of that time knows that Mr.
Lincoln himself was at the utmost pains to avoid
even the appearance of such a purpose and that during
nearly half the period of the war's duration he
resolutely refused to commit the government to that
cause by issuing a proclamation of emancipation, even
as a measure helpful to the national arms.</p>
<p>Instead of this short and easy catechism of causes
which has satisfied so many, especially those foreigners
who have more or less ignorantly written as
historians or critics of our war, it is necessary to go
back to the early history of the country, to study
there the conditions that laid the foundations of discord,
to find in the fundamental characteristics of
human nature and in the varying self-interests of
men the explanation of events that are otherwise inexplicable.</p>
<p>The American colonies were separately founded.

<pb id="VAC0885-027" n="21"/>
                    
Their settlers were persons of very diverse mind and
often of hostile interest but they were all inspired
by an abiding sense of the main chance. The minutely
studious historians who have written in our
later time have differed in many things but they are all
agreed that the early settlers upon these shores,
whether in Virginia first or in New York a little later
or in New England still later, were not heroes of
romance blown hither by adverse winds of fate or
by the buffeting of the gods, but plain, ordinary and
very commonplace men, ignorant for the most part,
narrow-mindedly selfish, and altogether intent upon
the bettering of their own fortunes as the chief end
of human life. The higher inspirations which we
are accustomed to attribute to them in our American
Aeneid did not exist. Those things were born later
of admiring imagination as higher aspirations usually
are in the discussion of national beginnings.</p>
<p>The colonies were far more remote from each other
than we can easily conceive. From Boston to Williamsburg
in the seventeenth century was a journey
more difficult, more toilsome and more dangerous
than a circling of the globe is in our time. And
even in the eighteenth century Charleston in South
Carolina was farther removed from Charlestown in
Massachusetts than either is to-day from Yokahama
or Hong Kong.</p>
<p>This element of remoteness cannot be too much
insisted upon as a cause of estrangement between the
widely separated colonies. The means of communication
between the several settlements of English-
speaking people were few and meager and painfully


<pb id="VAC0885-028" n="22"/>
                    
Uncertain. There were no railroads, no steamships,
no telegraphs, and in effect no mails. For not until
Franklin near the revolutionary epoch laid the rude
foundations of our postal system, was there any tolerably
trustworthy post in this land. We find in old
letters Abigail Adams in Boston apologizing to her
statesman husband in Philadelphia for having allowed
three weeks to elapse without a letter and offering as
a sufficient excuse the fact that during those weeks
she had "found no opportunity" to send a letter, no
"trustworthy hand going from these parts to yours."
And she and other correspondents of that time whose
letters have been preserved as precious historical material,
refer frequently to the public post as a means
of communication to which no rational person would
think of entrusting letters of any consequence.</p>
<p>In the same way Eliza Lucas, afterwards Eliza
Pinckney and the mother of distinguished revolutionary
personages, excuses her neglect to send letters
from James island to her intimates on the Cooper
river-twenty-five miles away-on the plea that she
had no trustworthy opportunity and that the post
was not to be thought of.</p>
<p>In still further illustration is the fact recorded by
Franklin in his autobiography, that when his rival
in the business of newspaper publishing had control
of the posts, he seriously embarrassed Franklin by
refusing to deliver his newspaper to its subscribers.
And it was a source of pride to Franklin that when
he, himself, became Postmaster General he generously
refused to retaliate upon his rival by denying
him in his turn the privileges of the mails.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-029" n="23"/>

<p>In these conditions it is not difficult to understand
that even as the revolutionary times approached, the
interchange of thought, opinion and sentiment among
the people of the several colonies was infrequent
and very meager and that during the previous, formative
century it had scarcely at all existed.</p>
<p>It is true that the immigrants who founded the
several colonies were mainly Englishmen. But during
a century and a half of remotely separate development,
they had had ample time for estrangement
of mind and for the breeding of very radical differences
of interest, aspirations and opinions. The
really astonishing thing about their history is that
after a hundred and fifty years or more of this diversely
conditioned  development there was left
enough community of thought and interest among
the colonists to make possible their alliance for revolutionary
purposes.</p>
<p>That alliance was of the loosest possible character,
marked in every detail of its terms by a jealousy
almost phenomenal. The first agreement of the colonies
to act together for the common defense was
as loose as the hurrah of a mob bound together only
by a temporary purpose in common. It was not until
the Revolutionary war was well advanced that even
the articles of confederation were agreed upon, and
they were about the flimsiest, most inadequate and
most inefficient bond of union that ever served to ally
states for a common purpose. Those articles of confederation
set out with a formal and emphatic
reservation to each state of its absolute, individual
sovereignty and independence-that being at the

<pb id="VAC0885-030" n="24"/>
                    
time the one thing which each of the revolted states
cherished with the most sleepless jealousy. They left
to each of the states the unrestricted right to do as it
pleased in all matters of sovereign concern.</p>
<p>The avowed purpose of the confederation was to
create a national government but the articles of confederation
distinctly denied to the central power every
right and function necessary to governmental activity
and independence. The so-called general government
could not levy any tax, enforce any impost, or in any
other way provide for the raising of money, the
payment of national debts, the organization of armies,
the enforcement of treaties or even the uniform validity
of statutory enactments.</p>
<p>Even in the act of creating a central power for
the sake of the common safety, the several states were
so jealous of their separate independence that they
resolutely refused to give to their general government
any power whatever to control the individual
states or the people thereof, even to the meager extent
of enforcing the national agreements with other
powers.</p>
<p>The Congress--there being no executive possessed
of any power--was authorized to call upon the several
states for contributions of men and money for the
common defense. But it was a case parallel with
Owen Glendower's ability to "call spirits from the
vasty deep." The question remained "will they
come?" And that question each state decided for
itself.</p>
<p>If we would at all understand the history of our
country we must bear in mind this intense. this resolute,


<pb id="VAC0885-031" n="25"/>
                    
this utterly uncompromising insistence of the
several states at the beginning upon their separate
sovereignty.</p>
<p>It was in this spirit that independence was
achieved and the independence thus won was not the
independence of a federated republic, but that of
thirteen individual and widely separated states, no
one of which owed any sort of allegiance to any other
or to all the others combined; no one of which was
ready upon any consideration to yield one jot or
tittle of its independent sovereignty to the will of
any other or of all the others.</p>
<p>The states, indeed, were as jealous of trespass by
each other as of trespass by Great Britain herself.</p>
<p>We are accustomed to think of them as closely
united commonwealths, engaged in a long and painful
struggle for the independence of the American
Federal Republic. They were nothing of the kind.
They were separate and diversely interested states
each fighting for its own emancipation from a foreign
yoke. They were allied in a common cause, but their
alliance had no bond more obligatory upon themselves
than is that which unites a mass meeting whose constituent
members are possessed temporarily of a common
purpose.</p>
<p>When the states had achieved their independence,
they undertook to live together in the loosely formed
union thus provided. They quickly found it impossible
to do so. Not only was their central government
powerless to fulfil its obligations to other countries,
or to pay its debts at home, or to enforce its authority,
or to levy and collect taxes, or to provide securely


<pb id="VAC0885-032" n="26"/>
                    
and properly for the maintenance of an army, a navy,
a postal service or anything else of a national character
or to do with certainty and authority any other
of the things which a nation that expects respect may
and must do, but it could not in any effective way
regulate trade either with foreign countries or between
the states. Each state had the reserved right to
interfere with the transit of goods across its borders
in ways that threatened presently to render trade
among the states impossible.</p>
<p>It was in view of these distressing conditions that
the statesmen of Virginia appealed to those of the
other states for a conference looking to the devising
of a better way, "a more perfect Union." The conference
thus called at Annapolis was attended by
representatives from only five of the states. But it
led to the calling of that Philadelphia Convention
which, under Washington's presidency, and with the
united wisdom of the most sagacious statesman in all
the commonwealths, framed the Federal Constitution.</p>
<p>The task was one of extraordinary difficulty. The
old jealousies of the states remained in scarcely
abated force. Each feared to surrender any part of
its sovereignty. Each dreaded the possible interference
of the others with its domestic concerns. Each
feared and dreaded a national power that might
some day control a state's actions and coerce it into an
obedience derogatory to its sovereignty. The less
populous states feared the possible dominance of the
more populous, and all of them ,alike feared the
possibly oppressive power of a national executive.</p>
<p>After months of such labor as statesmen have rarely

<pb id="VAC0885-033" n="27"/>
                    
given to the framing of a fundamental law, all these
differences were adjusted and in a considerable degree,
though not wholly, the individual apprehensions
of the several states were allayed.</p>
<p>The equal representation of states as such, without
reference to the numbers of their population, was
provided for in the peculiar constitution of the Senate,
in the organization of the electoral college which
chooses the president and still again in the provision
of the Constitution that in case of no election to the
presidency the choice shall be left to the popular house
of Congress, but with the express condition that each
state's representatives in that body, however numerous
or however few, shall have one and only one vote.</p>
<p>Again the Constitution reflected the jealousy of
the several states for their sovereignty by providing
specifically that all powers not delegated by the states
to the general government by the terms of that instrument
should be reserved to the states or to the
people thereof.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all these precautionary measures
and notwithstanding all the reservations made, two
of the states withheld their assent to the Constitution
for a year or two after it was accepted by the rest,
and in other states the vote by which it was ratified
showed a very narrow margin in its favor. Even in
Virginia, the state which had originally suggested the
union under the Constitution, whose Washington had
presided over the convention that framed it, whose
Jefferson and Madison and other statesmen had
strenuously advocated it, the influence of the most
potential statesmen of that period was barely sufficient

<pb id="VAC0885-034" n="28"/>
                    
to secure an affirmative vote by a slender majority
in favor of the adoption of that Constitution
which made the United States a nation and gave to
their government a recognized place among world
powers.</p>
<p>In brief the people of the original thirteen states
very reluctantly surrendered a narrowly restricted
part of the functions of sovereignty to the Federal
Government. They very jealously reserved to themselves
as individual states all the other functions of
sovereignty and independence. And even with such
restrictions and such reservations they gravely hesitated
before making a grant of power which threatened
the possible use of the Federal Authority in
control of a state's action or in restraint of a state's
sovereign independence.</p>
<p>This was the spirit in which the National Government
was formed. It was intended to be a government
for external and communal purposes only. By
every provision which the ingenuity of statesmanship
could devise the General Government was restrained
from trespassing upon the sovereign right of each
state to regulate in its own way and by its own
devices all matters not distinctly delegated to the
General Government by the express terms of the
Constitution.</p>
<p>For half a century after the adoption of the Constitution,
this view everywhere prevailed and was
everywhere recognized as authoritative. When, during
the War of 1812-15, New England found that the
course of the General Government antagonized the
local interests of that region, the states in that quarter


<pb id="VAC0885-035" n="29"/>
                    
of the country opposed the national policy even
to the extent of threatening a withdrawal from the
Union-secession in other words, and nullification.
It was Daniel Webster-afterwards the apostle of
"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable"
--who drew and championed the Rockingham
Memorial in 1812, in which his New England
constituency formally protested against the war then
existing with England and by unmistakable implication
threatened secession and a separate peace with
England on the part of the maritime states in the
northeastern part of the country. And immediately
afterwards Webster was elected to Congress where,
with the approval of that part of the country, he opposed
all measures designed to encourage enlistments
at a time when the country was engaged in foreign
war. He even went so far as to vote against the appropriations
for the national military defense against
the country's ancient foe, at that time engaged in an
effort to undo and reverse the results of the Revolutionary
war itself.</p>
<p>Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, writing of this incident,
expresses the opinion that it was an extreme
stretch of the liberty of legislative opposition to the
administration in a time of war and public danger and
that it carried the right of opposition to the utmost
limit to which it could go without treason.</p>
<p>Yet at the time nothing very serious was thought
of the matter for the reason that at that time the individual
state and not the National Government was
regarded as the primary and ultimate object of men's
allegiance.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-036" n="30"/>
                    
<p>The states felt themselves to be still only conditionally
and tentatively members of the Union.
They were still intensely jealous of their individual
sovereignty, and they were still indisposed to make
serious sacrifice of their own interests in behalf of the
common weal of a union which they regarded doubtfully
as an experiment. They still felt themselves
entitled to reject the experiment and withdraw from
the Union if at any time they should see fit to do so.</p>
<p>It would be easy to multiply historical illustrations
of this attitude of mind, extending, though with
diminishing frequency and force, to that time just
before the outbreak of the Confederate war when
N. P. Banks's cry of "Let the Union slide" was accepted
as the slogan of the anti-slavery party. But
the multiplication of such illustrations is unnecessary.
Every instructed mind is aware of the fact that at the
first the Union was regarded as a doubtful experiment
into which the states had entered with misgiving
and from which each state felt itself at liberty to
withdraw whenever it should find the yoke of the
Union a galling one.</p>
<p>Writing of Webster's replies to Hayne, Senator
Lodge frankly admits that the historical argument
was all against Webster; that there is no room for
doubt that at the first the Union was held to be an
experiment and withdrawal from it was everywhere
regarded as a reserved right of the states.</p>
<p>And even the right of a state while remaining in
the Union to nullify a national statute obnoxious to
its prosperity or to its moral sense was as directly
asserted in the personal liberty bills with which, just

<pb id="VAC0885-037" n="31"/>
                    
before the war, many states sought to render the
National Fugitive Slave Law inoperative, as it had
been asserted by South Carolina in that state's attempt
a generation earlier to annul and resist a law
imposing tariff restrictions upon trade.</p>
<p>But there are some other historical facts that must
be borne in mind if we would justly understand the
war catastrophe of 1861.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that before the beginning
of that year twenty new states had been created out
of territories that at the time of the Union's formation
were wildernesses. These new states had none of
that jealousy of their sovereignty which gave pause
to the original thirteen. They had entered the Union
not reluctantly, as states hesitatingly surrendering a
previously cherished independence, but eagerly as
communities upon which the dignity of statehood and
all the sovereignty that statehood implies had been
conferred by gracious gift of the Union. Those
communities had been suppliants for the favor of admission
to the Union and not, as the original states
were, the creators of the Union, surrendering to it
with more or less reluctance some share of an absolute
sovereignty previously enjoyed by themselves.
These new states were not benefactors of the Union
but its beneficiaries. They had surrendered no rights
of self-government to it, but on the contrary had
received from it as a gracious gift all the rights and
dignities of states, where before they had had no
rights and dignities whatsoever.</p>
<p>These new states had grown populous and prosperous
under that Union to which they had 


<pb id="VAC0885-038" n="32"/>
                    
surrendered nothing of independence and from which
they had received all they had of statehood and sovereignty.
Very naturally, then, their attitude toward
the Union was quite different from that of the older
states. That Union which the older states had always
regarded as their creature, owing its very existence
to their grace, the new states looked upon as
their creator to whom they owed all that they enjoyed
of liberty-giving autonomy.</p>
<p>In the newer states particularly, but in the older
states also, there had grown up a new conception of
the dignity and permanence of the National Union.
That which had been originally regarded as a doubtful
venture had little by little come to be looked upon
as a thing established and glorious. The national
idea had taken a new and deeper hold upon men's
minds and affections. Vast material and moral interests
had grown into sturdy self-consciousness under
its beneficent rule. That Union which had been entered
upon with so much doubt and hesitation and
with so many precautionary stipulations had become
one of the great nations of the earth, strong at home
and everywhere respected abroad. It had a history
in war and peace which was a precious possession of
all the people alike.</p>
<p>Proud, loving memories clustered about the story of
its career. The victories of New Orleans, and Buena
Vista, and Chapultepec, the sea conquests of Porter
and Perry and the rest, had been added to the stories
of Lexington, Concord, Bunker Hill, Trenton, Camden
and Yorktown, as fireside tales with which the
grandfathers made the eyes of a younger generation


<pb id="VAC0885-039" n="33"/>
                    
of Americans glisten with patriotism. And achievements
of peace equally notable-stories of what
Morse, Henry, Fulton, Peter Cooper, Daniel Boone,
Bowie, Kit Carson, Fremont, Sam Houston, General
Gaines and a multitude of others had accomplished
--were equally stimulating to the pride and
patriotism of the youth of the thirty-three states.</p>
<p>And there were heroic tales told of Indian wars
in which Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison,
Sam Dale, the Mississippi Yagers, Col. Dick
Johnson, and other veritable heroes of romantic daring
had figured. All these and scores and hundreds
of other tales of patriotic heroism were then familiars
of the fireside as illustrations of American pluck and
American achievement.</p>
<p>There was the country's expansion, too, to glory in.
The Louisiana purchase had added an empire of vast
extent and of inestimable productive possibilities to
the national domain, the development of which, even
before 1861, was a romantic wonder story of history.
The Mexican war had brought with it another accession
of incalculably rich territory such as no nation
in all history except our own had ever added at a
single stroke to its domain.</p>
<p>Where the Spanish gold-seekers had galloped for
centuries in search of the precious metal, finding it
not, an American had quickly discovered a new Golconda,
an Ophir, an Eldorado so rich in its productiveness
as for a time to threaten the stability of
gold as an accepted measure of values among men.
Vast regions that had remained for generations the
haunt of savages and wild beasts, with only here and

<pb id="VAC0885-040" n="34"/>
                    
there a mission station of adobe huts to offer hope of
better things in some far distant future time, became,
within a brief while populous territories ready to
take their place in the Union as important American
states. Better still, a new and matchless fruitfulness
had been discovered in vast valleys and upon far-
reaching mountain sides that had been previously
typical of hopeless sterility and desolation.</p>
<p>All these things had mightily stimulated the American
imagination and all of them had contributed incalculably
to the strengthening of the national spirit
and to the upbuilding of a new and controlling sentiment
of loyalty to the Union under which all this
actual greatness had been achieved and all this potential
greatness was confidently promised.</p>
<p>In still other ways the sentiment of nationality had
been strengthened. The orators of the land had
for generations mightily exalted the horn of the Nation
in eloquent speeches which all the schoolboys in
all the states grew enthusiastic in declaiming. All
the literary men of the land had celebrated the country's
glories in prose and verse that filled the school
books and set juvenile patriotism aflame with ardor.</p>
<p>All this patriotic awakening had for its object of
worship the glories of the Nation, and not at all the
narrower achievements of particular states or sections.
All of it referred itself to the Union as the
commonwealth. Neither literature, nor eloquence,
nor familiar household narrative concerned itself in
the least with any of those jealousies which had
prompted the original states to hesitate to enter the
Union. None of them recognized even in the remotest

<pb id="VAC0885-041" n="85"/>

way, those questions of conflicting powers and dignities,
those anticipations of encroachment on the part
of the central power, or those jealous guardings of the
rights of individual states which had played so large
a part in the settlement of the original problem of
a Federal Union.</p>
<p>In brief, the people had outgrown and forgotten
the doubts and fears of the earlier formative time.
In the main they knew nothing about such things and
cared nothing for them. They knew only that they
were citizens of the greatest, freest and strongest
nation on earth, and that its history was a heritage of
glory to all of them alike.</p>
<p>Lawyers' quibblings, logic chopping, and all arguments
drawn from history meant nothing to the great
majority of a people who had been born and bred
under the Union and had imbibed with their mothers'
milk a sentiment of undying loyalty, not to any state
or any doctrine or any theory, but to the Nation in
whose history they regarded themselves as entitled to
feel personal and ancestral pride and affection.</p>
<p>Thus while the historical argument was clearly
with those who maintained the right of the states to
assert their authority as superior to that of the Union,
that argument was addressed in large part to ears
that had been rendered deaf to it by the echoes of
the national glory. While the Union had indeed
been at the first a hesitating experiment, it had become
by time and by national achievement a
nationality for the maintenance of which vast populations
were ready and willing and even eager to
risk their lives.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-042" n="36"/>
                    
<p>If we would understand the war and the conditions
in which it came about, we must first clearly
realize the change that had occurred in popular sentiment,
and especially the growth of that national feeling
which had slowly but surely replaced the old
hesitation and jealousy of the states. Only the circumstance
that slavery existed and was defended in
one part of the Union and that it was antagonized
in the other part on grounds of policy, conviction,
and morality, kept alive the old sentiment of state
sovereignty and made the war possible. That sentiment
of the dominant right of the states was strongly
asserted on both sides and insisted upon both in behalf
of slavery and in antagonism to it until war resulted.
The history of that controversy must be the
subject of a separate chapter, in which its irritating
character as well as the difficulties that statesmanship
encountered in dealing with it, may be set forth
without undue elaboration but with sufficient detail
to render the result easily enough understood.</p>

<p>There is no possibility of doubt that, but for the
slavery controversy, that growth of an intense national
feeling which has been mentioned would have
rendered the war of 1861-65 impossible.</p>
<p>That intensely patriotic feeling of nationality was
all pervasive, except in so far as the slavery controversy
impaired it as it did, both North and South.
If that one cause of disagreement had not existed, if
there had been no negro slaves in the United States,
the sentiment of union and nationality which had
grown with the Nation's growth and strengthened
with its strength, would unquestionably have overborne
all the quibbles and all the logical refinements of
the earlier time. The decisions of the Supreme Court,
especially those of John Marshall, which in effect rewrote
the Constitution and successfully claimed for
the courts the right to annul any and all acts of Congress
that were not in accordance with the Constitution,
had created a new and effective barrier against
possible aggression by the Federal power upon the
autonomy of the states and had at the same time
established the Federal authority securely. When
Marshall decided in Marbury vs. Madison, that an
act of Congress assuming to do by national authority
anything reserved to the states in the constitutional

<pb id="VAC0885-044" n="38"/>
                    
grant of power to the General Government,
is no law at all but an act null and void, which
the courts will on no account enforce, there was an
end of all danger of wanton Federal encroachment
upon the reserved rights of the states. And, as we
have seen, that fear died out of men's minds, except
in so far as questions relating to slavery from time
to time revived it. But for those questions it need
never again have arisen to vex the Republic and set
its people by the ears.</p>
<p>But slavery involved questions of prejudice, questions
of passion, questions of morality, questions of
labor, questions of principle, and questions of pride,
of sentiment, of conscience, of religion, of conviction.
It stirred the passions of men, excited their prejudices,
and appealed to their interests as no other
question of policy has done in our modern times. Incidentally
it revived, as no other issue could have
done, all the old jealousies between the Union and
the several states which the progress of the Republic
had so strongly tended to allay. It set the history of
the formation of the Union against the history of the
Union itself as implacably antagonistic historical
arguments in behalf of conflicting contentions.</p>
<p>Let us see how all this came about.</p>
<p>When the colonies achieved their independence,
slavery existed, in greater or less degree, in all of
them. The negro was then nowhere regarded as a
man, so far at least as the generalizations of the
Declaration of Independence and other formal settings
forth of human rights were concerned. There
was a strong desire to be rid of slavery, a deep seated

<pb id="VAC0885-045" n="39"/>  
    
conviction of the impolity of that institution, but,
except among the Quakers and a very few others,
there seems to have been no thought anywhere that
the holding of negroes in bondage was a violation of
that fundamental doctrine of human rights upon
which the Republic had been established.</p>
<p>Indeed the desire to be rid of slavery seems at that
time, and for a long time afterwards, to have been
stronger at the South, where the institution was general,
than at the North where it existed only in a
scant and inconsequent way. As early as 1760, the
South Carolina colony had sought to limit the extension
of the system by passing an act forbidding
the further importation of slaves, but the British
Government had vetoed the measure. Twelve years
later Virginia sought to protect her people against
the black danger of slavery by imposing a prohibitory
tariff duty upon imported slaves. Again the home
government in London forbade the act to have any
force or effect.</p>
<p>When Thomas Jefferson, a Virginian, wrote the
first draft of the Declaration of Independence, one
of the strongest counts in his splendid indictment
of the British King was the charge that in these and
other cases he had forbidden the people of the colonies
to put any legal check upon the growth of this
stupendous evil.</p>
<p>But when the Declaration was adopted by Congress
and signed as the young Republic's explanation
of its revolutionary action, rendered in obedience
to "a decent respect for the opinions of mankind,"
the great Virginian's arraignment of the King for

<pb id="VAC0885-046" n="40"/>
                    
having thus fostered slavery in colonies that desired
to be rid of it, did not appear in that supreme document
of state. We have Jefferson's own testimony
that it had been stricken out in deference to the will
of those New England merchants and capitalists
whose ships and money found astonishingly profitable
employment in the slave trade between the coast of
Africa and the southern part of our country.</p>
<p>Thus while the holding of slaves in the more
northerly colonies had proved to be unprofitable and
had to a great extent ceased at the time of the Revolution,
the traffic in slaves from Africa to the southern
parts of this country was so profitable an industry
that even the Declaration of Independence must be
emasculated of one of its most virile features in
deference to the greed of gain.</p>
<p>And this dominance of interest over principle continued
for long years afterward. When the great
convention that framed the Constitution was in session,
it was at first proposed to put an end to the
slave trade from   Africa in the year 1800. An
amendment was offered, extending the license of
that infamous traffic to the year 1808, and this eight
years' extension was adopted by a vote which included
in the affirmative every New England state represented
in the convention, Virginia voting steadfastly
against it.</p>
<p>Those votes for the extension of the slave trade
were given undoubtedly in behalf of the mercantile
interest of the maritime states of the northeast, and
they reflected no moral conviction whatsoever. For
there was at that time no moral conviction of the

<pb id="VAC0885-047" n="41"/>
                    
wrongfulness of slavery anywhere in the country.
The thought that the negro was a man, endowed by
his Creator with an unalienable right to "life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness," had not yet been born
in America.</p>
<p>And even after thirty odd years, and a dozen years
after the constitutional prohibition of the African
slave trade had gone into effect, that unlawful traffic
in human beings was still so gainful an occupation to
merchants and shipmasters, that Mr. Justice Joseph
Story, himself a New Englander and a judge of the
Supreme Court of the United States, was bitterly
denounced by the New England press and public as
a judge who deserved to be "hurled from the bench,"
because he had instructed grand juries that it was
their sworn duty to indict the men who were still
engaged in the nefarious business of transporting
slaves, under conditions of unspeakable cruelty, from
Africa to these shores. The offense of that great
jurist lay in the fact that he regarded the demands
of the constitution and the law as more binding upon
his character and conscience than the demands of the
New England slave traders whose very profitable
business his insistence upon the rigid enforcement
of the law threatened to embarrass and destroy.</p>
<p>As there are now no advocates of slavery in our
free land; as all of us, North and South alike, are
agreed that the institution was a curse the maledictions
of which endure to the present day in vexatious
"race problems;" it is possible and proper now to
record all facts respecting it with impartiality and
without controversial intent. It is of supreme 


<pb id="VAC0885-048" n="42"/>
                    
importance to any clear understanding of this matter
to bear in mind the fact that our modern conceptions
of human rights did not exist in the earlier times; that
the recognition of the negro as "a man and a brother"
is the birth of comparatively recent thought; that
the traffic in black human beings, captured in Africa
and brought hither for sale as laborers, excited no
impulse of antagonism, offended no moral sentiment,
and seemed to nobody in the earlier times a violation
of those fundamental doctrines of human right upon
which this Republic is based. All that has been a
glorious after-thought, and it is solely with an expository
purpose and not at all as a <hi rend="i">tu quoque</hi> that
these facts of history are here set forth.</p>
<p>Surely the time is fully ripe in which men of the
'North and men of the South may sit together in an
impartial study of the causes of a quarrel that
brought them into armed conflict more than a generation
ago and may calmly consider without offense
the sins of their forefathers on either side, making
due allowance for the lack of modern light and leading
as a guide to those forefathers. We must do this
in this spirit, if we would be fair. Still more imperatively
must we do it if history is ever to be written.</p>
<p>The period of controversy is past. The time of
reckoning has come. The time has come when the
advocate holding a brief for the one or the other
party to the controversy should give place to the
historian intent only upon the task of discovering and
recording fact. The circumstance that there was
grievous wrong on both sides does not rob either of
the credit due for the right that it supported.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-049" n="43"/> 
                    
<p>After the revolution the great statesmen of our
land manifested a determined eagerness to free the
country from slavery. John Adams and Alexander
Hamilton were not more energetic in this cause than
were Jefferson and other Southerners. When Virginia
ceded to the Federal Government all her claims
to the territory northwest of the Ohio river, it was
Thomas Jefferson, the Virginian slaveholder, who
insisted upon writing into the deed of cession a provision
that slavery should never be permitted in any
part of that fair land which now constitutes the
states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>George Wythe, under whose tuition Henry Clay
studied law, was by all odds the greatest jurist that
Virginia ever produced, with the single exception of
John Marshall. George Wythe was one of those
whom Mr. Carl Schurz has in our own times characterized
as "the Revolutionary abolitionists." They
were the men of the South who regarded slavery as
an imposed and hereditary curse to be got rid of by
any means that did not threaten the social fabric with
destruction and the country itself with chaos and
black night. George Wythe absolutely impoverished
himself--born to vast wealth as he was--in setting
free the negroes whom he had inherited as slaves and
in providing them with the means of establishing
themselves in bread-winning ways. For, as he expressed
it, "I have no right to set these people free
to starve."</p>
<p>He gave them their liberty and with it a piece of
land for each, on which with ordinary industry and

<pb id="VAC0885-050" n="44"/>
                    
thrift they could surely make a living for themselves
and their families. Then he set to work, a man
stripped of all his ancestral possessions and impoverished
by his own act of justice, to earn a living as
a Virginian lawyer. So far from having offended
his fellow Virginians by his act of emancipation, he
had won their esteem and their reverence. He became
their chancellor and the most honored judge
upon their bench.</p>
<p>Thousands of other Virginians of lesser note than
George Wythe did substantially the same thing,
though less conspicuously. Under the law after a
time they could not set their slaves free without sending
them beyond the borders of the state. Many of
them found this condition a paralyzing one. They
must pay off the hereditary debts of their estates and
they must buy in the West little but sufficient farms
for their inherited negro slaves to live upon if they
would set those slaves free. These things many of
them did at cost of personal impoverishment, while
many others, like-minded, found conditions beyond
their control. If the whole story of that Virginian
effort to be rid of slavery by individual and grandly
self-sacrificing effort could be told here or elsewhere,
the angels of justice and mercy would rejoice
to read the page on which the wonder tale was written.
But the heroes who did these deeds of self-sacrifice for
principle were mainly obscure men of whose names
there remains no record. Only here and there a
great name like that of George Wythe appears.
Among these is the name of John Randolph of
Roanoke,--most insistently cantankerous of 


<pb id="VAC0885-051" n="45"/>
                    
Southerners--who left a will freeing all his slaves on
grounds of human right. And though that will was
defeated of its purpose by a legal technicality, it is
immeasurably valuable as a fact in history which reflects
the sentiment of that time among those who
had inherited and who held slaves and even among
those who, like Randolph, are commonly regarded as
the special champions of slavery.</p>
<p>And this desire of Southern men to be rid of slavery
did not cease until the very end. Very many
Southerners whose consciences dominated their lives,
deliberately and painstakingly educated their negroes
for freedom in the hope and assurance that sooner or
later, by one means or by another, freedom would
come to them. There were planters not a few who
used their authority as the masters of slaves to compel
their negroes to cultivate little fields of their own and
to put aside the proceeds thereof, as a fund with
which to meet the surely coming freedom face to
face, with no fear of starvation as a circumstance of
embarrassment.</p>
<p>Henry Clay studied law under Virginia's great
chancellor, George Wythe. From his distinguished
Virginian teacher he learned the lesson that slavery
--forced upon an unwilling people in the Southern
part of this country by kingly and corporate greed,
and still further forced upon those regions by the
greed of merchants and shipmasters, even after the
traffic that fed it had been prohibited by the Constitution
and by the law--was an evil and a curse, a
wrong to the black man and a demoralizing influence
to the white. He saw clearly that it was the task of


<pb id="VAC0885-052" n="46"/>
                    
all good men to exterminate that evil root and branch,
by such means as might be found available, without
the destruction of society as a necessary incident or
consequence. In the young state of Kentucky
Henry Clay began his political career as an advocate
of rational and gradual emancipation, and to his
dying day--involved as he was in all the strenuous
controversies to which the slavery issue gave rise in
national politics--he never lost his interest in this behalf
or abated his efforts to secure its accomplishment.
A plea for the extermination of slavery was
the first plea he ever presented to the people whom
he asked to support him for public office. A plea
for the extirpation of slavery was well-nigh the last
that he ever urged upon the people of his state after
all that was possible of honor had been conferred
upon him by their approving will.</p>
<p>So enduring was this sentiment at the South that
John Letcher, the Democratic war governor of Virginia,
the man who set Lee to organize the state's
forces for the Confederate war, the man who created
the Army of Northern Virginia and made possible
all its splendid achievements, was in fact elected governor
because of his abolitionist sentiments.</p>
<p>Mr. Letcher was strongly imbued with that conviction
which had dominated the best minds of Virginia
from colonial days, that slavery was a curse
to be got rid of and not at all an institution to be
defended upon its merits. He had publicly urged the
necessity of getting rid of it. He had explained to
his fellow Virginians, in public utterances, its demoralizing
influence upon the young white men of that

<pb id="VAC0885-053" n="47"/>
                    
commonwealth. Finally, so eager was he to rid his
native state of the incubus that he deliberately proposed
the one thing most offensive to the Virginian
mind, namely, the division of the "Old Dominion"
into two states in order that the western half
of it at least might be free from slavery. When he
stood as a candidate for governor in the last election
before the war, all these facts were used against
him to the utmost by the advocates of slavery and
they undoubtedly deprived him of many thousands
of votes east of the Alleghenies. The first returns
indicated the election of his adversary, William L.
Goggin, by an overwhelming majority. But when
the figures came in from the western part of the state,
where slavery scarcely at all survived, John Letcher
was elected. Thus the anti-slavery sentiment gave to
the foremost state of the Southern Confederacy its
singularly earnest and efficient war governor.</p>
<p>But side by side with this anti-slavery sentiment
in the South, there grew up a pro-slavery sentiment
which was buttressed by every impulse of gain that it
is possible for the human mind to conceive.</p>
<p>Near the end of the eighteenth century, Eli Whitney
made slavery enormously profitable by his invention
of the cotton-gin. Before that time slavery
had been of more than doubtful profit to the people
of the states that permitted it. It was not at all
an economical labor system. It required the master
to give to the laborer, in lieu of wages, such food,
habitation, clothing, nursing in illness and care in
infancy and old age, as no laboring population in the
world has ever before or since received in return for

<pb id="VAC0885-054" n="48"/>
                    
its labor. It involved pension as well as payment.
It imposed upon the employer obligations such as no
employer in all the world, before or since, has been
willing to assume.</p>
<p>But Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton-gin
made the payment of such wages possible and profitable.
It made it possible for a plantation owner to
grow rich while feeding, housing, clothing and caring
for his negroes as no other employer has fed,
housed, clothed and cared for his working people
since the foundations of the world were laid.</p>
<p>Eli Whitney's invention made illimitable cotton a
substitute for costly and narrowly limited linen and
in a great degree for good. It made it possible
for every man in all the world to put a shirt on his
back, a pair of sheets on his bed, a case on his pillow,
and to clothe his wife in calico and his children in
cottonade where before all these luxuries were denied
to him and his by inexorable laws of economics. But
incidentally that invention made slavery enormously
profitable, where before it had been doubtfully
profitable. Eliza Lucas of South Carolina, afterwards
Eliza Pinckney, had sought to find profitable
employment for her slaves by cultivating indigo.
Other enterprising experimenters had explored other
avenues of earning, but not one of them had found
a way of making profitable the ownership of slaves
until Eli Whitney devised a machine by the use of
which any ignorant negro could remove the seed from
three thousand pounds of cotton in a single day,
where before one negro man or woman could remove
the seed from only one pound or at the most a few

<pb id="VAC0885-055" n="49"/>
                    
pounds. From that hour forward, negro slavery
became profitable in the South, and from that hour
forth it stood as a "vested interest" with its influence
as such in politics.</p>
<p>Let us not misunderstand. The cultivation of cotton
by free labor has exceeded in its productiveness
by more than two to one, that cultivation under the
slave system. As has already been set forth in these
pages, the greatest cotton crop ever grown before the
war with which we here have to deal amounted only
to 4,669,770 bales, while under free labor the annual
production rose to an average of more than 11,000,000
bales in the closing years of the century which
saw the extinction of slavery.</p>
<p>Yet there is no doubt or possibility of doubt that
Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton-gin near the
end of the eighteenth century made negro slavery
profitable as it had never been before in this country.
It enabled the planter to grow rich upon the proceeds
of the labor of negro slaves whose industry
had before produced scarcely more than enough to
support themselves. It created a new era. It inaugurated
a new epoch. It instigated a new sentiment
in favor of slavery, where before the sentiment
had been tending the other way.</p>
<p>In considering human affairs historically it is very
necessary to bear in mind that men ordinarily have no
opinions. If by "opinions" we mean well considered
judgments, founded upon an orderly reasoning from
accepted premises, then opinions are the very rarest
of human possessions. If we are told that a particular
person was born and bred in Spain, we know

<pb id="VAC0885-056" n="50"/>
                    
without further inquiry what his religious convictions
are. If we learn that he is a Turk we perfectly
know his so-called opinions upon the subject of matrimony.
We take for granted the views of the Puritans'
sons and daughters concerning religion. We
know, without asking, what the "opinions" of any
American are with respect to the Declaration of Independence.
We know that, with the exception of
a very few men, all the people of the South were
firmly convinced that the cause of the South in
the Confederate war was a just one; that the National
Government had no conceivable right to coerce
recalcitrant states; that secession was an absolute
right of the states, and all the rest of it. On the other
hand we know that the Northern boy who had declaimed
Webster's reply to Hayne was fully imbued
with the conviction that "Liberty and Union" were
"now and forever, one and inseparable."</p>
<p>In other words, with here and there an exception,
men's opinions are determined by geography, tradition,
circumstance, self-interest and the like.</p>
<p>Thus when New England's chief interest was
maritime and commercial, Daniel Webster was the
most radical of free-traders. He held up to ridicule
and contumely Henry Clay's protective "American
system" and showed conclusively that nothing in the
world could be more utterly un-American. But a
few years later, when New England's interests were
centered in manufactures, Daniel Webster's opinions
became those of an extreme protectionist. In the same
way he opposed a national bank so long as New England
disliked that institution and favored it the

<pb id="VAC0885-057" n="51"/>
                    
moment New England desired its continuance. In
like manner John C. Calhoun began by clamoring
for the tariff protection of Southern industries and
developed into the chief apostle of nullification as
a means of escaping protective tariffs. Similarly
Clay began by making so absolutely conclusive an
argument against a national bank that Andrew Jackson
afterwards quoted it as the best possible plea
he could offer in support of his warfare upon that
institution after Clay had become its chief apostle.</p>
<p>Men ordinarily have no opinions except so far as
self-interest, geography, and circumstance determine
them and in considering matters of history it is of
the utmost importance to recognize that truth.</p>
<p>In the last analysis, therefore, Southern opinion
was determined in behalf of slavery by the cotton-gin.
And yet the greater number of Southern men were
not slaveholders and so had no personal interest in
the institution. Their opinions were merely a reflection
of the sentiment that surrounded them. That
sentiment was born of self-interest on the part of
a small but dominant class and it drew to itself
the sentiment of that much more numerous class--
the white man who owned no negroes. Of the
white men in the Confederate army, who made so
unmatched a fight for Southern independence, not
one in five had ever owned a slave or expected to
own one.</p>
<p>And there was another influence at work all this
while to create a sentiment at the South in favor of
slavery as an institution right in itself, where before
it had been almost uniformly regarded as an entail


<pb id="VAC0885-058" n="52"/>
                    
of evil. The circumstances of the national life
forced this question into politics and made of it an
incalculably exasperating issue.</p>
<p>The Nation having acquired the vast Louisiana
territory, invitingly fruitful as it was, the question
arose "What shall we do with it?" Men from all
quarters of the country wanted to go in and "possess
the land." Those of them who came from the South
very naturally desired to take their negro servants
with them into the new territories, and at first they
did so without let or hindrance. Even the Indians
of Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina,
and Alabama, when removed, practically by compulsion,
to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi
years later were freely permitted to take their negro
slaves with them, nobody gainsaying their right. In
like manner Southern men emigrating to Missouri
took their slaves with them without so much as a
question of their right to do so. And when Missouri,
in 1819, became sufficiently populous to justify an
application for statehood, a majority of the settlers
in that region desired that African slavery should be
permitted there.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Northern states, now completely
emancipated from slavery within their own
borders, had more and more learned to detest the
system. There had grown up in the North an intense
moral sentiment in antagonism to the further extension
of slavery. There had grown up also an intense
economic opposition to the system. It was felt that
the very existence of slavery in any region tended
to degrade free labor and to make of the laborer an

<pb id="VAC0885-059" n="53"/>
                    
inferior person not entitled to respect, a person not
quite a slave but still not quite a freeman.</p>
<p>It was, nevertheless, not deemed reputable to advocate
the abolition of slavery. The term "Abolitionist"
was then, and for a generation afterwards
continued to be, the most opprobrious epithet that one
man could apply to another.</p>
<p>Nevertheless when Missouri sought admission to
the Union as a slave state, the opposition was intense,
determined, angry.</p>
<p>Then came Henry Clay with a compromise. Earnestly
desiring the extinction of the slave system, it
was that statesman's fate to do more than any other
man of his era in behalf of the perpetuation and extension
of the institution which he regarded as a curse
and an incubus. There was one other thing for which
he cared far more than he did for the extinction of
slavery. In common with Webster and most others
of the statesmen of that time he was more deeply
concerned for the preservation and perpetuation of
the Union than for any other matter that appealed to
his mind. His attitude was identical with that of
Mr. Lincoln while the war was on, when he declared
his sole purpose to be the restoration of the Union
and proclaimed his conviction that the question of
slavery and all other questions were in his mind subordinate
to that.</p>
<p>Clay saw grave danger to the Union in this Missouri
controversy. In order to avert that danger, and
regardless of everything else, he brought forward
his compromise and succeeded in securing its enactment
into law.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-060" n="54"/>
                    
<p>Under that compromise Missouri was admitted to
the Union as a slave state; but it was stipulated that
no other slave state should be carved out of territory
north of 36° 30´ north latitude, that being the southern
boundary line of Missouri.</p>
<p>In practical effect this compromise excluded slavery
from all future states to be created out of the vast region
embraced in the Louisiana Purchase, except the
territory of Arkansas. Louisiana was already a state.
Missouri was permitted by the compromise itself to
become a state. The Indian Territory was forever
set apart for a special purpose and, it was then held,
could never become a state. There was no other acre
of the Louisiana Purchase lying south of the line
fixed by the compromise as the extreme northern
limit to which the institution might extend. Texas,
New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, California, Nevada,
Colorado and the rest were still Mexican possessions
which the great Republic had not then the remotest
thought of acquiring. On the other hand there were
all the vast, fruitful regions now known as Iowa,
Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota, the Dakotas and the
states lying to the west of them into which by this
agreement slavery might never go, from which it was
supposedly as effectually excluded as it had been from
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin by
that clause which Thomas Jefferson--in his eagerness
to make an end of the system--had written into
the deed of cession by which the Northwest Territory
became a national possession.</p>
<p>Clay fondly believed that this Missouri Compromise
of his devising had finally laid to rest the entire

<pb id="VAC0885-061" n="55"/>
                    
controversy with regard to slavery. Thirty odd years
later he was still laboring to induce his own state,
Kentucky, to adopt a system of gradual emancipation,
but in the meanwhile history had written
itself in another way and in direct antagonism to
his views.</p>
<p>There had grown up at the North an intolerance
of slavery which freely expressed itself in denunciation
of those who supported or countenanced the institution.
There had grown up at the South a sentiment
in advocacy of slavery such as did not exist in
that region in the earlier years of the Republic. Men
whose fathers and grandfathers had diligently sought
means by which to free their native land of a curse,
had little by little come to regard that curse as a blessing.
Men whose forefathers had regarded slavery
as an inherited misfortune, came to regard the institution
as right in itself and to defend it as the
best, most generous, and most humane labor system
in the world. In support of this contention they
could point to the factory system of old England,
and New England and argue with some truth that
nowhere in the world was labor so generously rewarded
as at the South.</p>
<p>Moreover, the antagonism to the system which had
developed at the North had its very natural reflex
effect. The offensive terms in which slave owners
were habitually spoken of in Northern prints were
well calculated to impel Southern men to the angry
and intemperate defense of their system. Still more
effective in breeding a "thick and thin" pro-slavery
sentiment at the South were the aggressive measures

<pb id="VAC0885-062" n="56"/>
                    
taken at the North for the annoyance of those who
held slaves.</p>
<p>The laws for the rendition of fugitive slaves--not
at that time so strict as they were afterwards made--
were habitually set at naught. There existed a fairly
well organized system called "the underground railroad"
by which slaves were induced to run away and
by means of which their flight was facilitated. All
this was dictated by a profound conviction on the part
of those who engaged in it that slavery was an institution
so utterly wrong that any means by which
its hold could be impaired were right in morals, no
matter what the law might say.</p>
<p>All this was done in defiance of law, in violation of
the statutes and in flagrant disregard of that compact
of reciprocity upon which the Union was
founded. We are not concerned in the twentieth
century to discuss the question of the right or wrong
of men's conduct in the first half of the nineteenth.
But if we would understand the irritations that bred
the war between the North and the South, we must
recognize not only all the facts but equally all the
refinements by which they were judged in their time.</p>
<p>For a time at least the Missouri Compromise took
the sting out of the slavery issue as a cause of controversy
between the North and the South. By that
compromise the South had given up all claim further
to extend its institutions into any part of the vast
and immeasurably rich territory included in the Louisiana
Purchase, with the single exception of Arkansas.
All the region that now constitutes Iowa, Kansas,
Nebraska, Minnesota, the two Dakotas--and all the

<pb id="VAC0885-063" n="57"/>
                    
vast territories west of those states,--were foreordained
by that agreement to be erected into free
states. South of the dead line established by the
agreement there remained the territory of Arkansas
and nothing else. Arkansas was admitted to the
Union as a slave state in 1836 and in the next year
the balance of power in the Senate and the electoral
college was restored by the admission of Michigan
as a free state. There remained within the limits of
our national domain no other acre of territory except
in Florida, into which under the terms of the Missouri
Compromise the southern emigrant could take
his slave property with him, while to the northern
emigrant there was opened a possession rivaling the
greatest empires of earth in area and in prospective
productiveness.</p>
<p>But for twenty-five years the compromise served
in a great degree to allay the asperities of the slavery
controversy. The anti-slavery sentiment at the North
was for the time satisfied with the assurance that
with the exceptions of Louisiana, Missouri and Arkansas,
all the great domain embraced in the Louisiana
Purchase was by that compromise forever devoted to
the system of free labor; that perhaps a dozen prospective
free states of inestimable wealth and incalculable
population were destined in the near future to be
added to the Union, while with the exceptions of
Florida and Arkansas, no further slave states could be
created. The South in its turn was satisfied with the
recognition which the compromise gave to slave property
as entitled to equal protection in national law
at least with other property.</p>

<p>If matters had remained as they were, there is
little room for doubt that the settlement reached in
the Missouri Compromise would have endured for
another generation at the least. It is true that, once
raised, the issue between free labor and slavery was,
as Mr. Seward afterwards said, "an irrepressible
conflict." It is morally certain that sooner or later,
in one way or in another, it was bound to lead to a
decisive struggle either of war or of diplomacy
between the North and the South. But we are
dealing now with facts and not with probabilities;
with events and not with conjectures; and the facts
and events strongly suggest that if no new condition
had intervened to disturb the settlement made by the
Missouri Compromise, that adjustment of the vexed
and vexing slavery question would have endured for
at least a generation longer than in fact it did.</p>                   
<p>The new circumstance that intervened was the annexation
of Texas. Texas was a vast territory, undefined
as to its limits at that time, but covering an
area eight or ten times greater than that of the largest
state then in the  Union. It included the present
state of Texas, New Mexico, and a large area besides.
It had been a part of Mexico, peopled chiefly
by emigrants from the United States under whose

<pb id="VAC0885-065" n="59"/>
                    
inspiration it had revolted and achieved its independence
as a republic.</p>
<p>Its desire for annexation to the Union was quite
natural and inevitable and but for slavery that desire
would have been reciprocated throughout the
United States. It was easily foreseen, however, that
the annexation of this vast territory, lying as it did
south of the line that set the limit to slavery, would
open to that institution an opportunity of expansion
scarcely less than that opened to free labor by the
Missouri Compromise.</p>
<p>The policy of annexation was bitterly opposed on
this ground and additionally because of the practical
certainty that annexation would involve a war with
Mexico.</p>
<p>Years before that time, Henry Clay had severely
criticized the administration for having failed to insist
upon our right to Texas as a part of the Louisiana
Purchase, but now, in his anxiety to keep the
slavery question out of politics because of the danger
it involved to the Union, he was strongly opposed
to the annexation policy.</p>
<p>When, in 1844, it was deemed certain that Clay
and Van Buren would be the rival candidates for
president, those statesmen, being personal friends,
met at Clay's residence at Ashland, and together
planned to keep the Texan question out of the coming
campaign. Their agreement was that each should
publish a letter--at about the same time--opposing
the annexation of Texas and the ratification of the
treaty, which was then pending, to accomplish that
Purpose.</p>
                    
<pb id="VAC0885-066" n="60"/>                    

<p>The letters were published, but their effect was
precisely the reverse of that which was intended.
The Whigs nominated Clay by acclamation, but the
Democrats of the South took offense at Van Buren's
letter and nominated in his stead James K. Polk,
an uncompromising advocate of annexation. Thus
the painstaking effort that had been made by Clay
and Van Buren to eliminate this annexation question
from the presidential campaign had for its actual
effect the making of that question the paramount issue
of the contest.</p>
<p>Thus the slavery question became again dominant
in national politics with a greater disturbing force
than ever. For the agitation in politics of a question
concerning which men's consciences or self-interests
are strongly enlisted--and this question involved both
--must always and everywhere intensify feeling,
arouse passion and consolidate partisan activity.</p>
<p>The result in this case was to intensify the sentiment
of hostility to slavery at the North and to break
down the sentiment in behalf of emancipation which
had previously been strong though decreasing at the
South. The agitation of those years continued to
the end, and in its course it slowly but surely changed
the conditions of the problem. At the North it made
anti-slavery endeavor respectable, where before it had
been looked upon with frowning as an activity which
threatened that Union which was the chief object of
American adoration. At the South, by putting men
on the defensive and filling them with a feeling that
they were menaced in their homes, it slowly but
surely broke down the old conviction that slavery was


<pb id="VAC0885-067" n="61"/>
                    
an evil to be cured and ultimate emancipation a national
good to be sought by every safe means that
human ingenuity could devise.</p>
<p>At the North it gave birth to a party willing to
sacrifice the Union itself, in behalf of the cause of
anti-slavery. At the South it gave birth to a new
party ready to defend and perpetuate slavery at all
hazards and at the cost of a dissolution of the Union if
that should become necessary.</p>
<p>In addition to this, as the years went on this new
agitation of the slavery question revived with added
intensity the old jealousy which the states had felt
toward the national power. Of that we shall speak
later. Let us first outline the course of events.</p>
<p>Texas was annexed. The Mexican war followed,
ending in the additional annexation of an imperial
domain including all that we now know as California,
Utah, Colorado, Nevada and the neighboring states
and territories. The question at once arose, What
shall we do with these new lands? A large part of
them lay south of the slavery dead line. Should that
part be open to slavery? Texas, itself a slave state,
was authorized by the terms of the contract of annexation
to form itself into four states with eight senators
and at least twelve electoral votes which a rapid
immigration might increase to twenty or forty within
a brief while. Arizona and New Mexico, claimed
by Texas as a part of its domain, seemed practically
certain to become independent states. California,--
even now extending from the latitude of Boston to
the latitude of Savannah and reaching inland half
as far as from the Atlantic to the Mississippi--had


<pb id="VAC0885-068" n="62"/>
                    
at least one-half its area and the better half, lying
south of the Missouri Compromise line. Moreover
the terms of the compromise did not forbid the extension
of slavery even into the whole of the California
country, a region that might easily be carved into ten
or a dozen states, for the restrictions of the compromise
applied only to territory acquired by the Louisiana
Purchase.</p>
<p>Here surely was cause enough for controversy.
And a new reason had arisen for intense obstinacy in
controversy. Let us consider this a little carefully.
The anti slavery agitation at the North was growing
more and more aggressively hostile. In common with
the pro-slavery sentiment at the South it had begun
to appeal to the old and dying sentiment of states'
rights for the justification of its attitude, thus reviving
a controversy between the national sovereignty
and the independence of the states, which had been
largely allayed by the progress of time.</p>
<p>Northern states refused to make themselves parties
to slavery even at command of the Federal Government.
They refused to lend their courts and jails
and sheriffs to the work of returning to slavery negroes
who had run away from bondage at the South.
They enacted laws in assertion of their State sovereignty
which in effect nullified the laws of the
Nation and effectually obstructed their execution.
We are writing now of the period from 1845 to 1860,
and not of a particular year.</p>
<p>Here was that revival of the old states' rights
controversy with the Federal authority, of which
mention has been made before.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-069" n="63"/>
                    
<p>It was met on the other side by an equally determined
assertion of states' rights. There was nowhere
any question that every state in the Union--except as
forbidden by the cession of the Northwest Territory
or by the Missouri Compromise--had full authority
to sanction or forbid the institution of slavery within
its own borders at its own free will. But there was
a party at the North which contended that slavery
was a wrong so enormous that it ought to be exterminated
by the high hand of Federal force; that the
disruption of the Union as an incident to such extermination
of the system would be a small price to
pay for an end so beneficent. The abolitionists
denounced the Constitution itself as "a covenant with
hell," because it permitted the several states to decide
for themselves whether or not they would permit
African slavery within their borders, and because it
authorized laws compelling the rendition of fugitive
slaves.</p>
<p>On the other hand there was growing up at the
South a party that preferred the disruption of the
Union to a longer continuance of existing conditions,
a party weary of struggling for what it held to be
the rights of the states under the Constitution and
disposed instead to resort to the ultimate right of
withdrawal from the Union which the South claimed
then, as New England had claimed it during the war
of 1812, as a reserved privilege of the states.</p>
<p>The slavery question had not only entered again
into national politics, but had become well-nigh the
only question of politics, state and national.</p>
<p>Congress was flooded with daily petitions for the

<pb id="VAC0885-070" n="64"/>
                    
abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia and
for the prohibition of the sale of slaves from one state
to another. Southern and some Northern members
opposed the reception of these petitions and endeavored
to secure rules to lay them on the table without
debate and without reference to any committee.
This policy was stoutly opposed on the ground that
it was in derogation of that "right to petition" which
in all free lands is held to be inherent in the citizen.
Debate ran high on this and like questions, and became
intensely acrimonious.</p>
<p>When the peace settlement with Mexico was pending,
a bill to authorize the rectification of boundaries
by the purchase of a large territory from Mexico was
presented in Congress. Mr. Wilmot of Pennsylvania,
in 1846, moved as an amendment a proviso--known
in history as "The Wilmot Proviso"--stipulating that
slavery should never be permitted in any of the territory
to be thus acquired.</p>
<p>This additionally intensified the controversy, and
while the Wilmot Proviso, though adopted by the
House of Representatives, was rejected by the Senate
and never became law, its suggestion and the
House's adoption of it were accepted by the South
as an additional evidence of the uncompromising
hostility of the anti-slavery party, and of a determination
at the North to use the Federal power for
the limitation, the restriction and the ultimate extermination
of slavery.</p>
<p>In the meantime a sentiment against abolitionism
had grown up at the North which was implacably
intolerant of opinion. Owen Lovejoy was put to

<pb id="VAC0885-071" n="65"/>
                    
death by an Illinois mob for his offense in publishing
an aggressively abolitionist newspaper. Other men
suffered persecution upon similar account. Newspaper
offices were wrecked and their proprietors sorely
dealt with by mobs in states which by their organic
law forbade slavery and the people of which had no
interest in the institution. They regarded all abolitionist
movements as agitations seriously threatening
the Union and recklessly risking the public peace.
They were ready to resort to mob violence by way
of repressing activities which they regarded as destructive
of public order and seriously menacing to
the Union, which had come to be an object of adoration
to the great majority of Americans.</p>
<p>Thus the controversy involved violence and lawlessness
at the North even more than at the South.</p>
<p>Again the anti-slavery propagandists at the North
were men of shrewd intelligence as well as men of
profound convictions as to the absolute righteousness
of their cause. They believed without doubt or question
that anything which might help to destroy slavery
was right. To that end they were ready to violate
law, to commit acts which the law--improperly as
they thought--denounced as criminal, and even to
destroy the American Republic if by that means they
could extirpate the system of human bondage. They
were devotees of a cause that admitted of no compromise
or qualification. They were crusaders at war
who regarded all means as righteous that might lead
to what they believed to be a righteous end. This
is not the place in which to question the correctness
of their belief or to criticize their conduct. Our concern

<pb id="VAC0885-072" n="66"/>
                    
is merely to record the facts and trace the consequences
of them.</p>
<p>The mails offered an easy and convenient means by
which these propagandists could address themselves
to other minds than their own, or those in known sympathy
with them. Accordingly they freely used the
mails as a means of impressing their anti-slavery
convictions upon black men or white at the South.</p>
<p>To them the literature which they sought thus to
circulate in the South was nothing more than an appeal
to reason and the sense of right. But to the
Southerner, whose family was at the mercy of a
multitude of slaves, it seemed a very different thing
and one immeasurably more menacing. To him it
seemed an incitement to servile insurrection in a region
where such an insurrection could not fail to result in
unspeakable horrors and calamities.</p>
<p>It is a fact imperfectly understood outside of the
South that the average negro there was not at all
such as the planter usually carried about with him
in the capacity of body servant to himself or maid to
his wife or daughter; not at all the "intelligent contraband"
so dear to the newsgatherers of the war time;
not at all a Booker T. Washington or a Frederick
Douglass, or a Blanche K. Bruce or a Montgomery,
but a hopelessly ignorant, passion-impregnated, half-
savage, held to good behavior only by fear of the
white man's superior power. On the coast of South
Carolina and in other regions the negro was in many
cases even a whole savage--recently imported, clad in
breech clout and ebonized nakedness and unable to
speak or understand any language except the Congo
gibberish to which he had been born.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-073" n="67"/>

<p>Of course literature made no direct appeal to creatures
of such sort. But there were many educated or
at least literate negroes at the South--some of them
slaves and some of them "free men of color" as the
law phrase at that time ran. If incited thereto, these
intelligent blacks might very easily have organized the
physical force of the multitude of more ignorant
negroes for an insurrection which would have involved
the wholesale slaughter of white women and children
and a servile war more horrible in its incidents and
consequences than any that the world has known since
time itself began.</p>
<p>It was altogether natural that the anti-slavery
agitators who had made up their minds to destroy
slavery at all hazards and at all costs and who held
all other considerations to be but as dust in the
balance in comparison with that one supreme desire
of their souls, should seek by means of the mails to
propagate their ideas in the South and among the
slaves themselves. But it was equally natural that
the white men of the South, whose wives and children
as well as themselves and their property were menaced
by such a possibility, should seek to avert it by any
means within their grasp. Their impulse was dictated
by the primal human instinct of self-preservation--an
instinct that listens to no argument and stops at no
act which may be necessary to avert the impending
danger.</p>
<p>These people saw their hearthstones menaced by
this use of the mails. They saw in the mails a certain
socialistic use of the people's power for a common
purpose. They paid taxes for the maintenance of


<pb id="VAC0885-074" n="68"/>
                    
those mails, and they could not see why a mail system
which represented and was supported by all the people
of all the states should be used for the destruction
and desecration of the homes of a part of those people
--for the instigation of a servile revolt which could
not fail to result in horrors so unspeakable that we
may not even suggest them, except vaguely, in this
place.</p>
<p>Since that time it has become a commonplace of
law to forbid the use of the mails to those who would
use them for any purpose inimical to the public welfare;
but at that time this thought had gained no
place in postal administration, and the desire of the
Southerners to purge the mails of incendiary literature
which threatened to create a servile insurrection
with all its necessarily horrible accompaniments, was
put aside as an effort to "tamper with the mail."
Contrary to all modern conceptions as to the mails
it was held that they were sacred alike to good and
to evil purposes and that any matter deposited in
them must be delivered to the person to whom it was
addressed in utter disregard of any question of
public polity and in absolute indifference to the
use which the person addressed might be disposed to
make of the printed or written matter sent to him.</p>
<p>In our time, where the post office refuses even to
rent a box to any man who cannot demonstrate to the
postmaster his need of it for legitimate business purposes,
and when the delivery of men's mail is deliberately
and quite unquestioningly stopped by the
postal authorities upon the mere suspicion that their
business may be in some way detrimental to the public

<pb id="VAC0885-075" n="69"/>

welfare, we find it difficult to understand why the
Southern objection to the distribution of dangerously
incendiary matter through the mails--matter which
threatened those American citizens with massacre for
themselves and something immeasurably worse than
massacre for their womankind--should not have received
respectful attention.</p>
<p>In the light of our modern postal practice it is difficult
to understand the anger and resentment with
which the demand of the Southerners was received
for the exclusion from the mails of matter the circulation
of which threatened themselves, their homes
and their families with calamities too horrible to be
contemplated with complacency.</p>
<p>But it must be remembered that on the other
hand the extirpation of slavery was confidently believed
to be an end so righteous as to justify any
means that might be employed for its accomplishment;
that the holding of men in bondage, whether
willingly or unwillingly, whether by virtue of an inheritance
that carried other and controlling obligations
with it, or by the speculative purchase of men's labor,
was a crime deserving of any calamity that might
fall upon those who participated in it in the process
of its extinction.</p>
<p>In other words there was intolerance on both sides;
misunderstanding on both; an utter failure on each
side to grasp the considerations that controlled the
acts of men on the other side; a fanatical dogmatism
on the one side and upon the other that was open to
no argument, no consideration of fact or circumstance,
no reasoning of any kind.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-076" n="70"/>
                    
<p>Thus came about the "irrepressible conflict." These
were the influences that created it and forced it to an
issue of politics. How it resulted in the most stupendous
war of modern times must be related in
other chapters.</p>

<p>The Mexican war and the subsequent negotiations
added a vast territory to the national domain.
Much of it lay south of the Missouri Compromise
line, and into that part of it at least the advocates
of slavery confidently expected to extend their labor
system.</p>
<p>The introduction of the Wilmot Proviso and its
passage by the House did not indeed result in the
exclusion of slavery from those territories, for the
reason that the proviso, failing in the Senate, did not
become law.</p>
<p>But it alarmed the South. By the Southerners of
the more radical pro-slavery school it was accepted
as a notice to quit; a notification that so far as Northern
anti-slavery sentiment could control the matter,
there was to be no further addition of a single acre
to the slave territory of the Union; that so far as that
sentiment could influence national politics, the power
of the Federal Government was thenceforth and forever
to be exercised to prevent the extension of
slavery into any new territory acquired or to be
acquired by the Union north or south of the Missouri
Compromise line, and in the end to abolish the system
altogether.</p>
<p>Let us clearly understand this situation. The

<pb id="VAC0885-078" n="72"/>
                    
Wilmot Proviso and all the attempted legislation, by
which it was sought to confine slavery within the
boundaries prescribed for it by existing conditions,
seemed to the opponents of slavery merely a legitimate
effort to emphasize the fact that free labor was
national, while slavery was a permitted evil within
prescribed limits permitted solely because within those
limits the national power was not authorized to exert
itself for the extermination of the system. On the
other hand, all these things seemed to the Southern
mind to be an utterly unjust discrimination against
a part of the people. The territories involved in the
controversy had become national possessions, they
contended, largely through the activities of Southern
men and Southern statesmanship. It was felt to be
a grievous wrong that Southern men should be forbidden
to emigrate to those territories on equal terms
with other citizens of the Union or that thus emigrating
they should be forbidden to take with them their
slave property, which represented in part their industrial
system but in far greater part their domestic life.</p>
<p>The very proposal thus to exclude them from an
equal participation in the opportunities and the privileges
opened to other citizens of the Republic by the
acquisition of these new territories seemed to them
a threat, a notification that henceforth they were to
be treated not as citizens of the Union entitled to the
same protection and the same privileges that were
extended to other citizens, but as inferior and offending
persons, persons graciously permitted to exist,
but persons to be excluded, because of their offenses,
from an equal participation in the conquests and land

<pb id="VAC0885-079" n="73"/>
                    
purchases of the Nation and from the enjoyment of
a share of the benefits resulting from the addition of
a great and immeasurably rich territory to the national
domain.</p>
<p>It is true that the proposal of their exclusion had
failed to become law. But it had failed by a margin
so narrow that its success might easily be anticipated
as an event of the near future. It is true that neither
the Wilmot Proviso nor any other legislation suggested
at that time sought to forbid Southerners to
migrate into the new territories. But it was proposed
that they should be forbidden by law to take
with them into those territories the slaves upon whose
services they relied not only for agricultural work,
but even more for that domestic service to which they
had been accustomed all their lives to look for comfort.
To tell them that they might remove their
households into the new territories, but at the same
time to say to them that they must leave behind all
that had before contributed to their prosperity and
to the comfort of their domestic arrangements, seemed
to them something worse than a mockery.</p>
<p>Out of the agitation of these questions arose very
important events.</p>
<p>The old sentiment at the South in favor of a gradual
emancipation of the slaves, though it survived
in some degree to the end, gave place, in large measure,
to a new sentiment in behalf of slavery as a
thing right in itself, a sentiment born of the instinct
of self-preservation.</p>
<p>The manifest disposition to exclude slavery from
the newly acquired Southern possessions prompted


<pb id="VAC0885-080" n="74"/>
                    
the men of the South to question the Missouri Compromise
itself. The spirit of that compromise had
been that slave property might be taken into territories
south of 36° 30´ north latitude, with the assurance
that such territories might become slave states,
in return for the stipulation of the South that all
territory lying north of that line should be forever
exempted from slavery. When the new territory was
acquired from Mexico, a large part of it lying south
of that line, it was naturally expected that in those
regions the people of the slave states were to find
an outlet for emigration as freely as those of the
Northern states found a like outlet north of that line.
When a determined effort was made, with every
prospect of success, to deny even this to them, they
began seriously to question a compromise by which
they had surrendered so much and seemed now
destined to gain so little. They had secured Arkansas
and Missouri as outlets for their superfluous,
discontented, unfortunate or specially enterprising
population; they had surrendered all claim to an
equal opportunity in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota,
the Dakotas and all the rest of the rich regions
embraced in the Louisiana Purchase. Obviously, it
seemed to them, they had made a bad bargain, and
now that they were threatened with a denial of their
share in the benefits of it, so far as the territory acquired
from Mexico was concerned, they were disposed
to repent them of it or at the very least to
question the extent to which its terms were binding
on themselves.</p>
<p>The compromise, they reflected, was merely a matter

<pb id="VAC0885-081" n="75"/>
                    
of statutory law. It had no constitutional obligation
back of it. It had been enacted by one congress.
It could be repealed by another. In answer
to the threat to disregard its spirit in dealing with
the new territories, the Southerners made the counter-
threat to repeal the compromise itself. It was all
very natural, very human, but to the Republic it was
very dangerous.</p>
<p>The lands that lay north of the dead line were still
territories and still for the most part unoccupied.
Nothing more binding than an easily repealable
statute forbade Southerners to migrate into those
territories with their negroes and in due time, by out-
voting Northern immigrants, to make slave states of
them. The essence of the compromise they held to be,
that in return for the prohibition of slavery north of
36° 30' north latitude, slavery should be freely permitted
in all regions lying south of that line if the
people settling there should so decide. If the contract
was to be repudiated on the one hand, why, they
asked, should it not be equally repudiated on the
other?  If the Missouri Compromise was to carry
with it none of the benefits it conferred on the South
why should it be held binding upon the South for the
benefit of the North?</p>
<p>This seems to have been the thought and attitude
of the South at that time, and it soon found expression
in legislation and in attempted legislation.</p>
<p>The discovery of gold in California quickly resulted
in such a peopling of that region as made its admission
to the Union as a state a necessity. The settlers
there were mainly from the North and they naturally

<pb id="VAC0885-082" n="76"/>
                    
had no desire to make a slave state out of the territory.
Without waiting for an enabling act they
adopted a constitution in 1849 and knocked at the
doors of the Union for admission as a free state.</p>
<p>Instantly the South took alarm. Quite half of
    California lay south of 36° 30' north latitude. Apart
from its gold, the region promised harvests of grain
and fruit of incalculably greater value even than all
the output of all its mines. There was nothing in the
Missouri Compromise or in any other legislation to
forbid the whole of California to become a slave state.
;There was only the decision of the people in that part
of the country that they wanted the state to be free
and that decision was not by any means unanimous.
On the contrary it was believed to be at least possible
that if the territory were divided into two substantially
equal parts the southern half of it would elect to become
a slave state.</p>
<p>This added enormously to the acrimony of the
slavery controversy. There had from the beginning
been accepted in the country a half formulated theory
of the necessity of maintaining a "balance of power"
between the opposing systems of slavery and free
labor so far at least as the Senate, representing the
states as such without regard to population, was concerned.
From the beginning slave and free states
had been admitted to the Union in effect in couples.
Thus Vermont, admitted in 1791, was balanced by
Kentucky, admitted in 1792. Tennessee came in in
1796 with no free state comrade till 1803, when Ohio
was admitted. Louisiana, admitted in 1812, was offset
by Indiana which became a state in 1816.


<pb id="VAC0885-083" n="77"/>
                    
Mississippi was admitted in 1817 and Illinois in the
following year. Alabama, admitted in 1819, was
balanced by Maine in 1820. Missouri came in in
1821 by a compromise that more than offset the omission
to create a corresponding and compensatory
free state. But when Arkansas was admitted in 1836,
Michigan was thrown into the other scale in 1837.
Florida and Texas, annexed in 1845, were balanced
by Iowa in 1846 and Wisconsin in 1848. But for
California as a free state there was no peopled region
that could be carved into a compensatory slave state
and for that reason, as well as because of the rise of
the anti-slavery agitation to fever heat, the controversy
about 1850 took on an angrier tone than ever,
and one more seriously threatening to the Union.</p>
<p>The people of the country at that time might justly
have been divided into three classes, viz:</p>
                    
<list type="ordered" rend="decimal">
                    
<item> Those extreme opponents of slavery who were
ready and eager to sacrifice the Union itself and the
Constitution to the accomplishment of their emancipating
purpose;</item>
<item> Those extreme pro-slavery men who were
equally ready to wreck the Union in order to perpetuate
and extend the system of slave labor;</item>
<item> Those intense lovers of the Union, North and
South, who were ready to put aside and sacrifice their
convictions for or against slavery in order to save
the Nation from disruption with all its horrible consequences
of civil war.</item>

</list>
                    
<p>This last class was at that time a dominant majority
and for long afterwards it exercised a controlling
and restraining influence over all the rest. It included


<pb id="VAC0885-084" n="78"/>
                    
men at the South who earnestly desired the extinction
of slavery, and other men at the South who were
sincerely convinced that the slave system was absolutely
necessary to the cultivation of Southern fields
and that its perpetuation was justified by the incurable
inferiority of the black race, and the hopeless
incapacity of the negro for freedom and self-government.
At the North the class of those who cared
more for the perpetuity of the Union than for either
the extinction or the perpetuation of slavery included
men of every shade of belief as regarded slavery
itself, except the extreme opponents of the system.
It included such men as Abraham Lincoln who, even
after the war was on, persisted in holding to his heart
as his supreme desire the perpetuity of the Union
in order, as he splendidly phrased it in his Gettysburg
speech, that "Government of the people by the people
and for the people might not perish from the
earth."</p>
<p>It was a magnificent conflict of human forces. Incidentally
it brought into play passion, prejudice,
malice, groveling self-interest and brutal disregard
of others' rights and feelings. But in large part it
was dominated, on the one side and upon the other, by
a love of liberty, an instinct of justice and an exalted
patriotism that did honor to those who were so inspired.</p>
<p>All these sentiments and aspirations were variously
directed, giving  rise sometimes to contradictory
courses of action. But he who would understand and
interpret the events of that time must fully conceive
the fact that the inspiring impulses of the great majority
were essentially and fundamentally the same


<pb id="VAC0885-085" n="79"/>

on both sides, however variously they may have been
interpreted into conduct. Only thus shall we understand
how it was that men on opposite sides of a
geographical line, men equally loving liberty and
equally holding in reverence the traditions of the
American Union, fell a-fighting in 1861 and for four
years waged the bloodiest and most devastating war
of which modern history anywhere makes record.</p>
<p>The controversy with respect to California and the
territories was only a part of the disturbing influences
of the middle of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The Constitution of the United States, in Section 3
of Article IV, distinctly imposed upon the states and
upon the people thereof the duty of returning to
their masters all fugitive slaves who might escape
from one state to another. That provision of the
Constitution was resented, even to the point of violence
by the antagonists of slavery; it was insisted
upon by the advocates of slavery--in the North as
well as in the South--to the border-land of crime.
It was defeated of its purpose, not only by the acts of
individuals banded together with express intent to
nullify it in practice, but still more by laws enacted
in many states at the North to facilitate its nullifications.
The law officers of many states either refused
to exercise their authority for the enforcement of this
law or going further, employed their authority to
prevent its enforcement.</p>
<p>Let us frankly recognize the fact that these men
were in effect disunionists, and the further fact that
they were such upon conscientious conviction. All
this was done in full faith that it was right and in

<pb id="VAC0885-086" n="80"/>
                    
response to the requirements of conscience. But it
was done in flagrant violation of the constitutional
compact. We may sympathize with the impulses of
the sheriff or other officer who refused to aid in the
return of an escaping negro to slavery, and still more
easily we may sympathize with those unofficial persons
who fed and housed and expedited escaping
slaves, in their refusal to aid a system of human bondage
of which they were conscientiously intolerant, but
on the other hand we may not justly blink the fact
that all this was in disobedience of the fundamental
law of the land, in violation of that compact on which
alone the Union rested, and in derogation of property
rights which the compact of union pledged all the
states to enforce and all the people to respect.</p>
<p>The whole trouble lay in the fact that there was
an "irrepressible conflict" between the ideas that were
dominant North and South and that laws and constitutions,
and compacts, and agreements were powerless
to enforce themselves or to get themselves
enforced in opposition to intense conviction and
strongly felt sentiment.</p>
<p>The feeling on both sides ran high and was intensely
intolerant. It was heedless of reason or argument.
It scoffed at compacts and agreements. It
made of legal obligations a mockery and of constitutional
requirements a laughing stock.</p>
<p>It entered also into every relation of life and
mischievously disturbed every such relation. It divided
families.  It disrupted churches, producing
divisions in them, some of which--most of which
indeed--have not been healed even in our present


<pb id="VAC0885-087" n="81"/>
                    
time when the war and slavery and all things pertaining
to them are matters of history.</p>
<p>Along the line of the Ohio river, where one brother
had gone across the narrow stream to Indiana in
search of fortune while another had remained behind
in Kentucky, the specter of this implacable controversy
wrought an estrangement that was at once
cruel and unnatural.  Skiffs lined the opposing
shores. Intercourse was easy and the waterway between
was of trifling width; but the skiffs were not
used, and the intervening waterway was left uncrossed,
because between those who dwelt upon the
one side of the stream and those who lived upon the
other there arose the black shadow of the irrepressible
conflict. They were friends and near relatives. Their
homes confronted each other with only a placid stream
between. Their shores were far less than a mile apart,
and their old loves for each other were uncooled, so
far as they realized. But they gradually ceased to
visit each other. Those courtships and marriages
which had been the frequent occasions of rejoicing
among them became of the very rarest occurrence and
finally ceased to occur at all. And all this in spite
of the fact that in northern Kentucky slavery was
scarcely more than a name while the people on the
other side of the river had, for the major part, been
emigrants from Kentucky, accustomed in their childhood
to such mild mannered slavery as still survived
beyond the stream.</p>
<p>Here was the line of cleavage. Here was the barrier
between men's minds and hearts and lives. On
the one side slavery was permitted and, in self-preservation

<pb id="VAC0885-088" n="82"/>
                    
chiefly, was defended. On the other side there
were softening memories of slavery as an institution
that had surrounded the childhood of those concerned
with the loving care and the affectionate coddling of
negro mammies and negro uncles. But the issue between
slavery and antagonism to it had become so
sharply accentuated that even family affection and
memories of childhood and the influences of near
neighborhood and the ties of close kinship could not
break down the barrier.</p>
<p>Still further, there had begun to grow up at the
North a political party whose sole bond of union was
antipathy to slavery. It was not at all respectable,
for even yet it was not deemed respectable in many
parts of the North to be an Abolitionist, and this was
distinctly an Abolitionist party. Its sole reason for
being was its purpose to abolish slavery in the United
States. It was still a feeble party, so far as the number
of votes it could command was concerned, but it
was prepared to ally itself with any others whose purposes
might tend even in the smallest degree in the
direction in which it wished the Republic to go. It
was ready to join in any effort that might help toward
the extirpation of slavery, but its avowed purpose was
not to assail slavery where that institution legally
existed, but to prevent its extension to any new lands.
In that purpose many thousands sympathized who
would scornfully have resented the imputation that
they were Abolitionists.</p>
<p>This new "Free-soil" party had no less a personage
than Ex-president Martin Van Buren as its candidate
for the presidency in 1848 and while its following

<pb id="VAC0885-089" n="83"/>
                    
and its poll of votes were small its menace seemed to
men of the South very great, a seeming that was
destined to be confirmed ere long. In 1840 the Anti-
slavery candidate, Birney, had received only 7,059
votes in the whole country, scarcely enough to be recorded
in the election returns. In 1844 the same
candidate received 62,300 votes--a great increase,
but still not enough to be reckoned seriously. In
1848 Martin Van Buren, as the candidate of this
Free-soil party, received 291,263 votes, thus greatly
more than quadrupling the highest directly Anti-
slavery vote previously polled. In 1856 the Free-soil
party under the name of the Republican party, was
in effect the only serious antagonist of the Democracy,
the only party that seriously disputed with it the
control of the National Government. In that election
the new party polled 1,341,264 votes, against
1,838,169 for the Democratic candidate. It carried
no less than 114 electoral votes out of a total of 296,
its successful antagonist carrying 174.</p>
<p>All this occurred after the time which we are now
considering, but the facts are presented here because
their coming was anticipated in 1850 and because
they serve to illustrate the rapidity with which the
"irrepressible conflict" grew in intensity and fervor.</p>
<p>In 1850 the country was on the verge of a revolution.</p>
<p>The Southerners were exasperated to the point of
armed revolt by the proposal to deny to them what
they deemed their fair participation in the fruits of
the Mexican War; by the increasingly active antagonism
of the North; by the aggressive opposition there


<pb id="VAC0885-090" n="84"/>
                    
to the enforcement of property rights in fugitive
slaves; by 'the condemnatory tone of the Northern
press, pulpit and platform; by the insistent use of
the mails for the circulation of literature which the
South deemed dangerously incendiary; by the continual
inflow of petitions to Congress for the abolition
of slavery in the District of Columbia; and by a score
of other annoyances which were ceaseless in their
aggression.</p>
<p>The feeling grew in the South that there was no
longer any place in the Union for those states that
permitted slavery; that there was no longer any tolerance
for their people; that a war upon them had begun
which would stop at nothing short of the forcible abolition
of their institutions, with all of chaos and
insurrection and servile revolt which they believed to
be the necessary sequences of such abolition.
They were affronted, offended and alarmed.
States' rights had been freely invoked against them
as a means of evading and defeating such laws as then
existed for the rendition of fugitive slaves. They, in
their turn, looked to states' rights as perhaps affording
to them a way of escape from their difficulties and
tribulations.</p>
<p>"If the Union can no longer protect us," they asked
themselves, "why should we remain parties to that
compact? If we are to have no share in its benefits
or even in its territorial conquests and purchases, why
should we go on bearing our share of its burdens and
obligations? If it cannot or will not fulfil those
duties which it has assumed towards us, why should
we not repudiate those obligations which we have

<pb id="VAC0885-091" n="85"/>
                    
assumed in return for its pledges of protection? If
we cannot be members of the Union upon equal terms
with other members of the Union, why should we
continue to be members of the Union at all?"</p>
<p>There was nowhere in the South the slightest doubt
of the right of any state in the Union to withdraw
from the compact and resume those attributes of
sovereignty which, in creating the Federal Government,
the several states had delegated to it. Indeed
up to that time there had been scarcely any doubt
anywhere, North or South, of the existence of this
right of the states, as a right reserved in the formation
of the Federal Union.</p>
<p>Accordingly there grew up in the South a distinctly
"disunion" party, a party which favored the
withdrawal of the slave states from a confederacy
which, they contended, had failed to render them the
protection or secure to them the equality of rights
and privileges which it had been instituted to render
and secure.</p>
<p>This impulse of withdrawal was very strong, but
like the radical impulse of disunion at the North for
the sake of abolition at all costs or hazards, it was for
a long time overborne by the dominant sentiment of
devotion to the Union and loyalty to the traditions
of the Republic. The majority at the South were
unwilling to give up the memory of Bunker Hill,
Lexington, Concord, Saratoga and Trenton, as a
national heritage of glory and likewise the majority
at the North were reluctant to forget the victories
of Marion and Sumter, or to relinquish the glorious
memory of Yorktown.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-092" n="86"/>
                    
<p>Thus in 1850 there was a party at the North eager
to sacrifice everything, including the Republic itself
with all its traditions, in order to secure the extinction
of slavery; and there was also a similarly radical
party at the South ready and willing to destroy the
Union in order to be rid of what it regarded as the
unreasonable and intemperate hostility to the South
within the Union.</p>
<p>Both these radical parties were in an apparently
hopeless minority each in its own section, but each
manifested a tendency to growth which boded ill for
the future. Nevertheless the overwhelming majority
of men on the one side and upon the other intensely
detested and bitterly resented every suggestion to
sacrifice the Union for any imaginable cause or upon
any conceivable occasion.</p>
<p>It was to this great majority, North and South,
that Henry Clay at that critical time appealed. The
dominant passion of that statesman's soul was his
love of the Union and his desire that it might endure
during all time. To that one god of his adoration
he had made sacrifices from the beginning. In its
behalf he had put aside his lifelong desire for the
gradual emancipation of the slaves. In its behalf he
had sacrificed the supreme ambition of his life--the
ambition to be president. In behalf of the Union
he had made himself <hi rend="i">anathema maranatha</hi>--at the
North as a slaveholder and at the South as an abolitionist.
He was in fact both at once. He held
slaves under a system of which he could not rid himself
without arming them, in Jefferson's phrase,
"with freedom and a dagger." He wanted them

<pb id="VAC0885-093" n="87"/>

emancipated and was ready to make sacrifice in that
behalf, but on the other hand he desired beyond all
other things the preservation of that Union, to the
perpetuity of which his whole life had been devoted,
and to the perpetuity of which he looked for the enduring
memory of whatever was worthy of remembrance
in American history.</p>
<p>In an extraordinary degree Clay rose above the
passions of the hour, as did Webster and certain
other statesmen of that time,--though certain other
statesmen of the time did not.</p>
<p>He saw the situation clearly. The Union had been
formed in candid recognition of the fact that slavery
existed in full force and effect in certain of the states,
while in certain other states, chiefly by reason of its
unprofitableness, it was slowly passing away at the
time of the Constitution's framing. He perfectly
understood that the Constitution was a compact between
states that could ratify or reject it at will, and
that but for concessions made on the one side and on
the other, the Constitution could never have become
the fundamental law of the Republic. He clearly
understood that the dealings of the Constitution with
this question of slavery constituted a compromise to
which the moral sentiments and the material interests
of both sides were parties.</p>
<p>But as has been explained, there had grown up at
the North and at the South two parties of extremists
who cared little or nothing for the Union and everything
for their opposing purposes: the Northern
party for the abolition of slavery at all costs, even
at cost of the destruction of the Union itself; and the

<pb id="VAC0885-094" n="88"/>
                    
Southern party organized for the perpetuation and
extension of slavery regardless of everything else,
regardless of the Union and of all that it signified
of human liberty and of the practical realization of
the doctrine of self-government among men.</p>
<p>Neither party represented the people in whose behalf
it professed to speak. The abolitionists, whose
petition for the dissolution of the Union we shall
hereafter present, certainly did not represent the
thought or desire of the great majority of the Northern
people. In the same way the Southern disunionists
who sought the disruption of the Union in
order that slavery might "have free course to run and
be glorified," did not represent the great body of
Southern citizens, many of whom deprecated slavery
and longed for its extinction by some safe process of
gradual emancipation. But in both cases the extremists
were accepted on the opposing side as representatives
of the general thought; the extravagant opinions
and demands of fanatical persons on the one side or
the other were interpreted as the settled convictions
of the great body of the people on the side thus misrepresented
to its hurt.</p>
<p>Among the extremists on both sides the disruption
of the Union was jauntily contemplated as a ready
remedy for ills complained of.</p>
<p>As early as 1844 the Legislature of Massachusetts
had resolved "That the project of the annexation of
Texas, unless arrested on the threshold, <hi rend="i">may tend to.
drive these states into a dissolution of the Union."</hi>
Again, in 1845, the Legislature of Massachusetts
passed and the governor of that state approved, a

<pb id="VAC0885-095" n="89"/>
                    
resolution asserting a right of nullification and declaring
that the admission of Texas as a state in the
Union "would have no binding force whatever on the
people of Massachusetts." That resolution could
mean nothing less than that Massachusetts would
withdraw from the Union in the event of the admission
of Texas, for otherwise laws enacted by virtue
of the vote of Texas senators must have "binding
force" upon the people of Massachusetts as upon
those of all the other states.</p>
<p>There were other resolutions of similar purport
adopted by the Legislature of Massachusetts that it
is not necessary to set forth in a history which is not
an indictment but merely an expository setting forth
of facts by way of accounting for events.</p>
<p>On both sides disunion was constantly and freely
threatened if either side could not have its way. A
convention of Southerners held at Nashville, Tennessee,
distinctly recommended the secession of the
South and called for a Southern congress to consider
and adopt that policy. About the same time Mr.
Hale of New Hampshire introduced in the Senate
(Feb. 1, 1850) a petition deliberately calling upon
the national legislative body to adopt measures for
the dissolution of the Union.</p>
<p>The petitioners were citizens of Pennsylvania and
Delaware, but they constituted only a small fraction
of the people of those states and unquestionably their
proposal, if put to a vote in Pennsylvania and Delaware,
would have been buried under a mountainous
majority of adverse ballots. Yet the petitioners deliberately
assumed to be and to speak for "the inhabitants"

<pb id="VAC0885-096" n="90"/>
                    
of those states, and their petition was undoubtedly
accepted at the South as representing popular
opinion in the region whence it came, if not indeed in
the entire North. It was the mischief of such things
that, while they were the work of a fanatical few, they
managed to pass themselves off as utterances representative
of public sentiment in the quarter from
which they emanated.</p>
<p>The petition was as follows:
                    
<q rend="blockquote">
                    
We, the undersigned, inhabitants of Pennsylvania and
Delaware, believing that the Federal Constitution, in pledging
the strength of the whole nation to support slavery,
violates the Divine Law, makes war upon human rights, and
is grossly inconsistent with republican principles; that its
attempt to unite freedom and slavery in our body politic has
brought upon the country great and manifold evils, and has
fully proved that no such union can exist but by the sacrifice
of freedom and the supremacy of slavery, respectfully ask
you to <hi rend="i">devise and propose, without delay, some plan for the
immediate, peaceful dissolution of the American Union.</hi>
                    
</q>
                    
</p>

<p>Daniel Webster fitly exposed the character and
significance of this petition by moving that it be
prefaced with a preamble as follows:

<q rend="blockquote">Whereas, at the commencement of the session, you and
each of you took your solemn oaths, in the presence of God
and on the Holy Evangelists, that you would support the
Constitution of the United States; now, therefore, we pray
you to take immediate steps to break up the Union, and
overthrow the Constitution of the United States as soon as
you can.</q>
                    
</p>
                    
<p>So repulsive was this proposal of disunion that

<pb id="VAC0885-097" n="91"/>
                    
only three senators voted even to receive the petition
embodying it and in the House a like refusal was
made. But those three senators were Mr. Seward,
of New York, Mr. Chase of Ohio, and Mr. Hale of
New Hampshire--three great leaders of Northern
thought who were destined soon to become three men
of dominant influence in the new party of Free-soil
and leaders in antagonism to the Southern claim to a
share in the new territories.</p>
<p>There might have been a score of other votes for
the petition which would have had far less significance.
The votes of these three senators meant clearly that
the Free-soil party looked upon disunion just as the
extreme pro-slavery men of the South did, as a legitimate
and always available remedy for existing ills
or a prophylactic against evils anticipated.</p>
<p>As early as 1847 Mr. Calhoun had set forth the
Southern contention with regard to the territories in
a series of carefully worded resolutions which read
as follows:

<q rend="blockquote">
Resolved, that the territories of the United States belong
to the several States composing this Union, and are held by
them as their joint and common property.

Resolved, that Congress, as the joint agent and representative
of the States of this Union, has no right to make
any law, or do any act whatever, that shall directly, or by
its effects, make any discrimination between the States of
this Union, by which any of them shall be deprived of its
full and equal right in any territory of the United States,
acquired or to be acquired.

Resolved, that the enactment of any law which should,
directly or by its effects, deprive the citizens of any of the

<pb id="VAC0885-098" n="92"/>
                    
States of this Union from emigrating, with their property,
into any of the territories of the United States, would
make such discrimination, and would, therefore, be a violation
of the Constitution and the rights of the States
from  which such citizens emigrated, and in derogation
of that perfect equality which belongs to them as members
of this Union, and would tend directly to subvert the Union
itself.

Resolved, that it is a fundamental principle of our political
creed, that a people, in forming a Constitution, have
the unconditional right to form and adopt the government
which they may think best calculated to secure their liberty,
prosperity, and happiness; and that, in conformity thereto,
no other condition is imposed by the Federal Constitution
on a State, in order to be admitted into this Union, except
that its constitution shall be republican; and that the imposition
of any other by Congress would be not only in
violation of the Constitution, but in direct conflict with the
principle on which our political system rests.</q>
</p>                   
                  
<p>Here we have from the South a threat of disunion,
a trifle more disguised, perhaps, than the threats that
had come from the North, but not less positive. The
resolutions were intended especially to cover the new
territories which the country was then acquiring from
Mexico by conquest and treaty, but they covered with
equal effect all of that territory which had been added
to the Union by the Louisiana Purchase, and the
greater part of which had been set apart by the
Missouri Compromise to be formed into free states.
They were a challenge to the Missouri Compromise,
and the assertion of a doctrine which afterwards
greatly vexed the country and contributed in an 
important way to the bringing about of war. They

<pb id="VAC0885-099" n="93"/>
                    
constituted a plea for that repeal of the Missouri
Compromise which was to come a very few years later.</p>
<p>This was the condition of things which Congress
had to confront on its assembling in December, 1849.
Disunion was everywhere in the air and on each side
there was a party openly advocating it as the only
remedy for existing and threatened ills. Both in the
North and the South this party of disunion was in a
hopeless minority, but by reason of its ceaseless and
aggressive activity it had managed to make itself
seem the authorized exponent of public opinion for
each side.</p>
<p>The questions before the country were many, but
they all related, directly or indirectly, to slavery.
Should California be admitted to the Union as a free
state? If so with what boundaries? for California
then included Utah, Nevada and adjacent territory.
Or should California, limited to the present boundaries
of that state, be divided into two commonwealths,
so that the Southern half might come in as a slave
state to offset the Northern half in the Senate and
the electoral college? Texas had already been admitted
as a slave state, but its boundaries were still
vague and undefined. It claimed jurisdiction over
all that we now know as New Mexico and Arizona.
Should that vast region--the sterility of which was
at that time wholly unappreciated--be added to the
domain of slavery, or should it be set apart in the
hope that it might be erected presently into two or
three or possibly half a dozen free states?</p>
<p>There were also two complaints of arrogant
aggression from the opposing sides. At the North

<pb id="VAC0885-100" n="94"/>
                    
there was complaint that the "slave power," as it was
called, sought and threatened to make itself dominant
and supreme in the Union by its demands for the
rendition of fugitive slaves. At the South there
was complaint that the homes and firesides of the
Southern people were menaced with servile insurrection
by the activities of those who sought to breed
discontent among the negroes and spread among
them sentiments dangerous to public peace and order.
There was complaint at the North that the constitutional
and statutory provisions for the rendition of
fugitive slaves exacted of Northern people an 
obligation which many of them could not conscientiously
fulfil, making them unwilling parties to a system
which their consciences abhorred, or, if they refused
obedience, condemning them to the condition of lawbreakers
and denouncing them as criminals because
of their refusal to do that against which their very
souls revolted. On the other hand the people of the
South complained that their Northern brethren, or
many of them, not only assisted runaway slaves to
escape but deliberately incited them to that course
and that the constitutional compact upon that subject
was not enforced by any adequate statutory law.</p>
<p>On both sides discontent was rampant and threatening.
On both sides dissatisfaction had begun to
look to the dissolution of the Republic as the readiest
remedy available.</p>
<p>There were statesmen like Senator Benton who
laughed to scorn the idea that any considerable part
of the people could ever seriously contemplate an
assault upon the integrity of the Federal Union, but

<pb id="VAC0885-101" n="95"/>
                    
that the Union was truly and very gravely in danger
subsequent events conclusively demonstrated.</p>
<p>It was to save the Union from disruption at the
hands of Northern or Southern fanatics--all of whom
were threatening that disaster--that Clay framed,
Webster supported, Congress adopted, and the President
approved the compromise measures of 1850.</p>
<p>Those measures covered substantially all the points
in controversy. The bills were five in number.</p>
<p>The first provided for the separation of New
Mexico from Texas, with compensation to Texas,
and for the admission of that territory to the Union
as a state when it should become populous enough,
with or without slavery as its own people should at
such time determine.</p>
<p>The second set off Utah from California and provided
in a precisely similar manner for its ultimate
admission to the Union as a state.</p>
<p>Neither of these two measures ever resulted in anything
practical. Even unto this day New Mexico
has remained too sparsely populated for statehood
and Utah was not admitted to the Union until long
after the Constitution of the United States had been
so amended as to prohibit slavery in any part of the
Republic.</p>
<p>The third of Clay's compromise bills provided for
the admission of California to the Union as a state
under the Constitution which it had adopted, which
made no provision for the existence of slavery within
its borders.</p>
<p>The fourth of the bills was a new and more strenuous
fugitive slave law than any that had ever before

<pb id="VAC0885-102" n="96"/>
                    
existed. It was intended to carry out the provision
of the Constitution of the United States on that subject
and it was supposed to be offset to Northern
sentiment by the fifth of the compromise measures
which forbade the slave trade within the strictly
national domain of the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>It had long been a grievance to Northern minds
that this peculiarly national territory, governed as
it was exclusively by a Congress representative of all
the states in the Senate and of all their people in the
House, and wholly without any expression of the
will of its inhabitants, was made a slave mart, into
which the slave-trader from Maryland or Virginia
could take his chattels for sale on the auction block
to other slave-traders who were there to buy speculatively
that they might sell again to the owners of
cotton and rice fields at the South.</p>
<p>In the North and South there had always been a
radical distinction in men's minds and consciences,
between slavery and the slave-trade; between the
holding of men in hereditary bondage under a system
essentially patriarchal and kindly, and the deliberate
traffic in human beings for purposes of speculative
profit.</p>
<p>There were two distinct questions with respect to
slavery in the District of Columbia. To have abolished
the institution there root and branch, as multitudes
of petitioners prayed, would have been to
menace the two states, Virginia and Maryland, which
had given the District to the Union. <ref id="ref_001" rend="super" target="note_001">1</ref> It would have
been to establish within their borders and by national

<note id="note_001"><ref target="ref_001" rend="super">1</ref> Virginia's portion had been receded to that State in 1846.</note>

<pb id="VAC0885-103"  n="97"/>
                    
authority a little Canada into which fugitive slaves
from either of those states might escape with the
certainty of thereby achieving freedom; for in the
temper of that time no fugitive slave law could by
any possibility have been enforced there after once
Congress had decreed the abolition of slavery within
the District.</p>
<p>But the abolition of the <hi rend="i">slave-trade</hi> within this
peculiarly national domain was quite another matter.
It left to all Southerners summoned thither on one
or other sort of governmental business, or removing
thither to reside, the right freely to bring their domestic
servants with them without fear of molestation;
but it made an end of that traffic in negroes as
mere merchandise which was even more offensive to
the better people of the South than to those of the
North--which was socially as severely frowned upon
in the one part of the country as in the other and
concern with which made the slave-trader as completely
a social outcast in Virginia as it might have
done in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Mr. Clay's five bills were framed and introduced
in pursuit of his dominant purpose to preserve the
American Union at whatever sacrifice of principle
or of interest, and in like spirit they were enacted by
both houses of Congress. They had the strong support
of Daniel Webster in one of the ablest orations
he ever delivered in behalf of the Union; a speech
made, as Webster's biographers contend, in full
knowledge of the fact that its delivery must cost him
his very last hope of election to the presidency; a
speech which brought upon him the odious accusation

<pb id="VAC0885-104" n="98"/>
                    
of having "sold out to the slave power."<ref id="ref_002" rend="super" target="note_002">1</ref> They had
the support also of men on both sides of the danger
line of cleavage who strongly disapproved of some
of them but who voted for all in the firm conviction
that together they constituted a compromise necessary
to the preservation of the Union.</p>
<p>That object was still supreme in the minds of the
great majority, North and South alike. It was felt
on both sides--in spite of personal convictions, personal
interests, and the irritating friction of political
agitation--that after all, the cause of human liberty,
human progress, and the system of self-government
among men was dependent upon the perpetuity of
the union of these states. It was felt that the enslavement
of the negro, now that the Constitution, the
statute law, and the public sentiment of the country
had robbed it of its most repugnant feature--the
African slave-trade--was a matter of minor consequence
in comparison with the perpetuity of the only
government on God's earth which had ever rested its
right to be upon the twin theories of unalienable
rights and the consent of the governed.</p>
<p>To the two disunion parties, the one aggressively
active at the North in behalf of abolition and the
other equally aggressive at the South in behalf of
slavery, these compromise measures were intensely
offensive. But to the great majority of the American
people their passage seemed imperatively necessary
to the preservation of the Republic, and this

<note id="note_002"><ref target="ref_002" rend="super">1</ref> Unhappily for his reputation Mr. Webster gave color to this charge by
accepting a large sum of money from Mr. Corcoran as a scarcely
disguised reward for the speech.</note>

<pb id="VAC0885-105" n="99"/>

sentiment found expression in the action of both
houses of Congress upon them.</p>
<p>All of them were enacted by decisive majorities
and all by the votes of statesmen from North and
South, acting together and putting aside their sectional
prejudices in behalf of the Union.</p>
<p>The bill for the admission of California as a free
state, against which the strongest opposition was
made from the South, had thirty-four senators in its
favor against only eighteen in opposition, four of
the votes in behalf of it being cast by the four great
Southern leaders, Bell of Tennessee, Houston of
Texas, Benton of Missouri, and Underwood of 
Kentucky--a list to which Mr. Clay, as the author and
sponsor of the bill must be added as a king of men.
In the House,--more directly representative of popular
sentiment--the vote in favor of the bill was no
less than one hundred and fifty, with only fifty-six
against it. This was the bill most offensive to the
South and so the vote upon it reflected the strength of
the Southern desire for the perpetuity of the Union.</p>
<p>On the other hand the Northern desire for the 
accomplishment of that end was reflected in the vote
upon the Fugitive Slave Law which constituted a
part of Clay's compromise scheme,--a part of it 
intended to offset to the South the admission of the
whole of the present state of California as a free
state.</p>
<p>This Fugitive Slave Act was passed by a vote of
twenty-seven to twelve in the Senate, and by a vote
of one hundred nine to seventy-six in the House.
Three Northern senators voted for it and one other,


<pb id="VAC0885-106" n="100"/>
                    
Mr. Dickinson of New York--who wished to vote
for it, was paired with his colleague Mr. Seward. In
the House thirty-two members from Northern states
voted in favor of the Fugitive Slave Law.</p>
<p>But the discussion of these compromise measures
lasted for eight months, and it was by no means confined
to the halls of Congress. There was the fourth
estate--the newspaper press--to be reckoned with,
and behind that were the people. The people themselves
and the newspaper representatives of popular
opinion took a free part in the discussion, and both
were unrestrained by parliamentary etiquette or by
any of those considerations of polity and statecraft
to which members of either house of Congress made
obeisance. There was a great devotion to the Union
it is true among press and people, but it did not take
statesmanlike form or consider those nice questions
that statesmen were bound to take into account.</p>
<p>On either side the popular desire for the preservation
of the Union was complicated with the conviction
that only the iniquities and injustices of the other
side imperiled the Republic. On each side there was
a profound conviction that if the other side would
behave itself as it should, there would be no shadow
of danger to the Union. Again on either side there
was an intemperate press, representing an utterly
intolerant party of extremists, and, shut their eyes
as they might to facts, the statesmen of that time
were aware that these extremists on the one side and
upon the other, were daily adding to their numbers
and daily becoming more and more nearly representative
of popular sentiment.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-107" n="101"/>

<p>The matter was complicated with partisanship, also,
and with personal ambitions. There was the question
of supremacy in the Nation, between the Whigs,
who were then in power by virtue of Taylor's election
in 1848, and the Democrats who, with one other brief
interval, had been dominant in national affairs during
the entire preceding half century. At the South
the two parties, laying aside the questions of polity
that had previously separated them, vied with each
other in such support of slavery as should win the
good will of the extreme pro-slavery party. At the
North they were rivals as suitors for the favor of the
new Free-soil faction--for at that time it was only a
faction which Know-Nothingism was destined presently
to relegate temporarily to the background.</p>
<p>But at the North the new Free-soil party drew
more heavily on the Whigs than on the Democrats
for its support, although its early leaders and presidential
candidates, John P. Hale and Martin Van
Buren, were distinguished Democratic statesmen.</p>
<p>Accordingly there arose in the country a contest
between the two old parties for the favor of the two
new ones. It became in fact a scrambling auction,
in which each party in each section and each state and
each district bid its convictions and its principles,
without scruple, for votes. Each party sought to be
more intensely pro-slavery than the other in those
states and districts in which the pro-slavery sentiment
was strong, while in those states and districts in which
the anti-slavery sentiment was manifestly dominant,
each party rivaled the other in its courtship of the
prevailing dogma and its representative voters.
</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-108" n="102"/>

<p>Quite naturally, men ambitious of political preferment
trimmed their sails to catch these varying winds,
and for the first time in the history of the country
political conviction and principle very generally gave
way to questions of self-interest. If the politician of
that time was not quite "all things to all men," he was
at any rate all things to the men who could cast the
larger number of votes for his elevation to office.</p>
<p>The accusation of such selfish sacrifice of principle
and conviction for the sake of personal aggrandizement
was openly made against the foremost statesmen
of the time, including Clay and Webster, and
the President himself. Whatever any one of these
did that was displeasing to one part of the country,
was freely attributed to a desire to "curry favor,"
as the phrase went, with "the slave power" in the
one case, or with "the abolitionist sentiment," in the
other.</p>
<p>Without questioning the motives of the greater
men, who offered their dominant devotion to the
Union as the only and amply sufficient explanation of
their actions and their votes, it is safe to say that the
attitude and course and eloquence of a multitude of
minor men possessed of ambition for political preferment
were determined, on the one side or the other,
chiefly by a consideration of votes.</p>
<p>Mr. Clay, Mr. Webster and the statesmen who
aided them in adopting the Compromise of 1850,
confidently believed that by their action in that matter
they had laid the slavery question to rest for at least
a generation to come. They had in fact, as the event
proved, succeeded only in opening it anew and adding

<pb id="VAC0885-109" n="103"/>

virulence to its discussion. Their very debates, preparatory
to the passage of the compromise bills, had
stirred the country to a discussion of the question,
angrier than any other that had been known since the
Constitution was framed. The measures themselves,
so far from allaying excitement and controversy, intensified
both. The South felt that it had been
cheated in a bargain which gave one free state certainly
and two, three or four prospectively, to the
North, with absolutely no certainty and little probability
of the admission of any slave state in compensation--
for from the first the people of Texas
resented and resisted the proposal to divide their
great domain into the four states provided for at the
beginning. On the other hand the Northern States
felt that the new Fugitive Slave Law was an enactment
with which they could not comply without such
a sacrifice of conscience and conviction as could in no
wise be made by honest and sincere men.</p>
<p>From the very first many of the Northern States
set their legislative machinery at work to defeat the
operation of this Fugitive Slave Law by the most
effective counter legislation  that legal ingenuity
could devise. In so far as these devices succeeded in
preventing the execution of that law they in effect
nullified a national statute which the National Government
was entirely competent to enact.</p>
<p>More important still from the point of view of
history, is the fact that the compromise which was
intended to allay all sectional feeling and work a
pacification in behalf of the Union, directly and 
immediately wrought an opposite result. It additionally

<pb id="VAC0885-110" n="104"/>
                    
inflamed passion in all parts of the country. It
strongly accentuated those differences of opinion
which alone threatened the Union with dissolution
and the country with devastating war.</p>
<p>The North set itself to nullify the Fugitive Slave
Law. The South set itself to undo the Missouri
Compromise.</p>
<p>On the one hand it was contended that the Fugitive
Slave Law made slavery a national instead of a
state institution--a thing to which Northern sentiment
and Northern conscience could in no wise
consent. On the other hand it was stoutly insisted
that the equality of the states under the Constitution
was openly violated, not only by the personal liberty
laws enacted by Northern States in order to nullify
the national statute on the subject of fugitive slaves,
but still more aggressively by the practical exclusion
of slaveholders from the territories, so far at least as
their slave property was concerned; and further by
the decree of the Missouri Compromise that, whatever
the will of the settlers in new regions might be, there
should be no new slave states carved out of that portion
of the Louisiana Purchase which lay north of the
southern line of Missouri. This prohibition--taken
in connection with the admission of California as a
free state--amounted in effect to a provision that
there should be no more slave states created anywhere;
for, as Mr. Webster had clearly pointed out, there
was no other part of the territory conquered or purchased
from Mexico, into which slavery could be practically
or profitably extended.</p>
<p>The attempts made to enforce the Fugitive Slave

<pb id="VAC0885-111"  n="105"/>

Law at the North, whether successful or baffled,
served only to inflame passion on both sides and to
intensify the very controversy which it had been the
purpose of the act--as a part of a compromise--to
allay. On the other hand the Southern conviction
grew that by the two compromises the South had
been cheated of its equal rights in the public domain,
and out of that contention was destined almost immediately
to grow a bloody war in Kansas and a still
more acrimonious state of feeling between the North
and the South.</p>
<p>The story of that matter is reserved for another
chapter of this history. In the meanwhile, if the facts
have been adequately set forth, it must be clear to the
reader that the Compromise of 1850 not only failed
of its purpose of pacification, but resulted immediately
in the very marked increase of hostility between
the sections, the intensifying of the irritation
and the accentuation of the acrimony that pervaded
and inspired the dispute.</p>
<p>The fundamental trouble was that the statesmen
who fondly thought to settle the matter by a compromise,
did not grasp the truth of the situation
with which they were called upon to deal. They
did not appreciate the fact that there was indeed an
"irrepressible conflict," between the two systems, a
conflict which no compromise could end, no arrangement
could mollify, no agreement could by any possibility adjust.</p>
<p>War was already on between abolitionism and
slavery. It was idle to seek for grounds of reconciliation
between convictions so utterly antagonistic

<pb id="VAC0885-112" n="106"/>
                    
and so necessarily irreconcilable. The compromisers
were men crying "Peace" where there was no peace
and no possibility of peace. They were visionaries
seeking to reconcile sentiments that were as opposite
as the poles. In opinion and sentiment as well as in
physics, there are affinities that may not be resisted
and antagonisms that no power can overcome. There
was no flux of political agreement that could fuse
Northern and Southern sentiment on the subject of
slavery into one homogeneous whole--no <hi rend="i">vehiculum</hi>
in which the two antagonistic principles could mingle
in harmony.</p>
<p>The key to the situation, as every sincere historian
must recognize, if he would interpret the events of
that time aright, was the fact that this conflict was
indeed "irrepressible," and that it could end only with
the extinction of slavery on the one hand, or with the
universal and constitutional recognition of slavery
as a national institution on the other.</p>
<p>The Compromise of 1850 was futile and a failure
because it was founded upon the ignoring of this
fundamental truth.</p>

<p>The failure of the Compromise of 1850 to accomplish
its purpose did not at first appear in the
national election returns. In fact the new Free-soil
party polled fewer votes in 1852 than it had cast four
years before, but in the elections of the several states
of the North it was steadily gaining ground precisely
as in the South the extreme disunion pro-slavery
party was likewise doing.</p>
<p>Little by little the more conservative men on either
side were being drawn into the radical propaganda.</p>
<p>In 1852 there appeared in print a novel which was
destined to affect the history of the Union as no other
novel ever did before or since. Every historian of
that epoch must reckon with "Uncle Tom's Cabin"
as one of the vital forces affecting the history of the
time.</p>
<p>The novel was written by Mrs. Harriet Beecher
Stowe, who personally knew very little about slavery
except by hearsay. Of necessity it abounded in 
inconsistencies, mistakes of facts, and impossibilities
so far as its social depictions were concerned. All
these things have been pointed out by criticism and
need not now be recapitulated, the more because they
have no historical importance whatever. But the
novel made a tremendous appeal to the sentiment of

<pb id="VAC0885-114" n="108"/>
                    
humanity in antagonism to slavery. It argued no
question, it offered no statistics, it presented no thesis.
It simply appealed to the sentiments of men, and
women, and children, for the abolition of slavery and
its influence was immediate and well-nigh limitless.</p>
<p>As there are no fixed canons of criticism by which
to determine the artistic merit or the dramatic value
of any work of the imagination it is of course open
to those who choose to contend, as many have done,
that Mrs. Stowe's work was not at all great as a
creation in fiction but that its immediate and stupendous
success and influence were due solely to the
adventitious circumstances of its publication. But
those adventitious circumstances did not exist in the
remote European countries into whose languages the
novel was presently translated and among whose
people it continues to be a classic to this day. These
people knew nothing whatever of American slavery
and cared little if at all about it. They were in no
degree influenced in their judgment of Mrs. Stowe's
romance by any of the considerations that vexed the
politics of this Republic. They read the novel because
of its intrinsic and intensely human interest and
because of nothing else whatever.</p>
<p>The better judgment would seem to be that "Uncle
Tom's Cabin" was a work of extraordinary dramatic
power and phenomenal fitness to appeal to the sympathies
of men. It had for its subject one of the most
picturesque states of society that has ever been known
among men and one so unusual among modern nations
that its very rarity added to its charm as a theme
for the romance writer.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-115" n="109"/>

<p>There is another important fact which must be
taken into consideration in estimating the influence
of that work of fiction. At that time all the churches
frowned upon novel-reading as a sin. A few of T.
S. Arthur's temperance tales were cautiously permitted
to the elect, but as a rule the reading of novels
was rigidly forbidden to those who constituted the
congregations of the churches. Even Dickens, who
was then in the midst of his extraordinary popularity,
was read only secretly and with shamefacedness by
those who submitted themselves to the instruction of
the clergy. The Methodists in particular--and
Methodism was, as it still is, a very great power in
the land--frowned upon all works of fiction as the
devil's agencies for the perversion of the human mind
and the destruction of the human soul. Novel-reading
was classed by all the pulpits of the time with
such sins as Sabbath-breaking, whiskey-drinking,
dancing, and other devices of Satan. The great
majority of men and women of that generation were
effectually forbidden to read even the great masterpieces
of their mother tongue, from Shakespeare onward.
But here in Mrs. Stowe's work was a novel
approved of all the clergy, a novel which anybody
might virtuously read, and a generation hungry for
creative literature of a date later than the "Pilgrim's
Progress" eagerly welcomed the opportunity to read
a novel, full of flesh-and-blood interest, that appealed
strongly to the kindlier and better sentiments of
human nature. The preachers read the book and
recommended it to their parishioners and as a consequence
everybody read it--men, women and children.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-116" n="110"/>

<p>Very naturally this universal reading of such a
romance greatly inflamed the sentiment of antagonism
to slavery and incidentally aroused something like
hatred of the slaveholder though Mrs. Stowe had
probably not intended that to be the effect of her
written words.</p>
<p>There were a dozen or a score of more or less inane
novels put forward in answer to "Uncle Tom's
Cabin" but their only effect was to intensify the interest
in that work.</p>
<p>Coming as it did upon the heels of the new and
peculiarly offensive Fugitive Slave Law Mrs. Stowe's
romance converted pretty nearly all the people of
the North to the anti-slavery cause and hastened the
growth of the anti-slavery party into formidable proportions.
It awakened sentiment, and sentiment is
always an immeasurably more potent factor in human
affairs than mere intellectual conviction is. It enlisted
in the anti-slavery cause every gentle and every
rampant impulse of the people of the North. It
rubbed out of multitudes of men's minds every
consideration  of  constitutional restriction, every
thought of states' rights, every dogma of the law and
every decree of the courts. It quickly bred a new
crusade against slavery. It everywhere stimulated
the thought that slavery was a wrong for which the
whole Nation was responsible and the extermination
of which, at all costs, the Union was bound to accomplish
as its first and highest duty. In brief, this novel
bred a spirit of abolitionism such as the country had
never before known.</p>
<p>The time had not yet come when any political

<pb id="VAC0885-117" n="111"/>                    

party could plant itself, with the smallest hope of
success, upon a platform of openly avowed abolitionism.
Those who were ready to advocate an aggressive
political warfare upon the system of slavery
where it legally existed and to insist upon its abolition
by force of Federal enactment in contravention
of the Constitution were still in a hopeless minority.
They were opportunists in politics, however, and they
saw and seized their opportunity. If they could not
gain all that they desired they were ready to accept
whatever might be accomplished in the direction of
the end they sought. The Free-soil party presented
itself to their minds as an easily available instrumentality.
It is true that that party had expressly and
with extreme circumspection disclaimed all purpose
and all constitutional right to interfere with slavery
in the states in which it legally existed. But the
avowed antagonism of the party to the system of
slavery rendered it a conveniently available agency
for the execution of the will of those who desired that
slavery should cease to be at all costs. All the abolitionists
joined the party at once, in spite of its
voluntary and to them offensive limitation of its activity
to the purpose of preventing the extension of the
slave system into new territories. On the other hand
men by scores and hundreds of thousands throughout
the North who would have bitterly resented the
still opprobrious epithet of "abolitionists" eagerly
joined the new party in the undefined but warmly
cherished hope that it might somehow find means of
ridding the Republic of the curse and the scandal
of slavery.</p>

<p>The Missouri Compromise was in effect repealed
by the compromise measures of 1850 but there was as
yet no formal repeal. The effect of the compromise
measures of 1850 was presently to stir up a greater
strife than ever on the subject of slavery and even to
raise new questions with regard to it. The ultra
Southern men began to see that the Compromise of
1850 had given them practically nothing whatever in
the way of territory out of which to create future
slave states.</p>
<p>It had admitted California as a free state. It had
opened Utah, which lay mostly to the north of the
dead line, to the possible introduction of slavery if its
future settlers should so decree upon coming into
the Union, as no sane man in any quarter of the
country imagined that they ever would. It had also
separated New Mexico which lay mostly south of
the dead line, from the slave state of Texas with a
like license to its future settlers if there should ever
be any such, to choose for themselves whether or not
they would permit slavery in their domain.</p>
<p>Neither of these territories promised, at that time,
to become a state within the life of the generation

<pb id="VAC0885-119" n="113"/>
                    
then in being, and in point of fact neither did. Utah
was not admitted to the Union until 1896, long after
the utter abolition of slavery had been accomplished
by constitutional amendment, and New Mexico, at
the beginning of the twentieth century is still a territory
of vast area and very small population.</p>
<p>The passage of the Fugitive Slave Law was in
fact the only return the Compromise of 1850 had
made to the South for what the South regarded as a
practical surrender of territory that might otherwise
have been molded into slave states. At the North
this compensatory enactment was everywhere regarded
as an excessive return for such concessions as
had been made. The great body of the Northern
people would not and could not lend themselves to
the execution of a law which offended their consciences
as no other law had ever done. They could
not make themselves, as that law required them to do,
participants in a system which they held to be utterly
wrong and iniquitous.</p>
<p>Thus the South felt itself wronged and cheated in
the compromise and the North felt that its conscience
had been outraged and its integrity of mind assailed.</p>
<p>It was altogether inevitable that the calmer consideration
and the discussion of this matter should
bring up new questions and create new situations.
The Missouri Compromise had not yet been formally
repealed. That Compromise forbade the creation of
slave states out of any part of the Louisiana territory
lying north of the southern line of Missouri, and
by implication it forbade the carrying of slaves into
any such territory prior to its admission as a state.

<pb id="VAC0885-120" n="114"/>
                    
Under the Compromise Missouri and Arkansas had
been admitted to the Union as slave states and for
thirty years the Compromise had stood as a bulwark
against disunion.</p>
<p>But now there appeared a tendency on the part of
the territories lying north of the Missouri Compromise
line to become populous. Emigration seemed to
be setting in that direction and the fertility of the
region promised presently to tempt great multitudes
of men to settle there. That part of the territory
which now constitutes Kansas was especially tempting
to emigration. The eastern half of Kansas was a
part of the Louisiana Purchase. Its western half
was a part of the region acquired from Mexico. The
eastern half of it, therefore, was subject to the Missouri
Compromise's prohibition of slavery while the
western half by virtue of the compromise measures
of 1850 was free from that restriction.</p>
<p>Out of all the conditions here briefly noted there
arose at the South a clamor for the repeal of the
Missouri Compromise. Men argued that as it was
only a statute repealable at any session of Congress,
and as, in their contention, it robbed and wronged the
slave-holding half of the Union, it ought to be repealed.
At the North it was felt that repeal would
in effect make of slavery a national institution, and
rob the anti-slavery sentiment of the benefit it had
secured by consenting to the admission of Missouri
and Arkansas as slave states.</p>
<p>There was a very strong man in the Senate at that
time, Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois. He was a born
leader of men, a man of great ability and courage,


<pb id="VAC0885-121" n="115"/>

and he had ambition to become president of the
United States. He was a master of statecraft and
an opportunist in politics. He had sought some years
before to settle the question with regard to the new
territories once for all by enacting a law to extend
the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific, thus excluding
slavery north of that line from all the new
as well as from   all the older possessions of the
Republic and by implication permitting it south of
that line.</p>
<p>As his proposal was rejected it is not worth while
now to speculate upon what effect its acceptance
might have had. In lieu of it the compromise measures
of 1850 were enacted. Their effect was almost
immediately to increase and intensify an inflammation
of the popular mind which it is difficult in our time
even to conceive. Senator Douglas voted for these
measures and advocated them strongly in the Senate.
When he returned to his own state at the end of the
session he found himself an object of public hatred
and condemnation. The City Council of Chicago
greeted his coming with a set of resolutions in denunciation
of him. The resolutions declared him to
be a traitor and pronounced the compromise measures
a violation of the law of God. The City Council
instructed the police, and advised all citizens to disregard
the new laws. A mass meeting was called
and by resolution it declared it to be the duty of all
good citizens "to defy death, the dungeon and the
grave" in resisting the Fugitive Slave Law, but so
uncertain was the popular mind, even in its fury, that
Douglas promptly challenged it and met it in a great

<pb id="VAC0885-122" n="116"/> 
                    
mass meeting before which he delivered an impassioned
speech explaining his views. By this single
speech he secured an immediate and well-nigh unanimous
rescinding of the resolutions of censure and a
little later he was again elected to represent the state
in the Senate.</p>
<p>Three years later, in 1853, on his return from
Washington to Illinois and after he had made himself
sponsor for that Kansas-Nebraska Bill of which
an account will presently be given, he picturesquely
said that he had traveled all the way from Washington
to Chicago "by the light of his own burning
effigies."  Nevertheless when his term expired a few
years later he was again elected to the Senate after a
conspicuous canvass of the state in which his reëlection
was practically the only question at issue and in
which Abraham Lincoln was his opponent on the
stump.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that Northern sentiment
on the questions then dividing the country was uniform.
It was on the contrary as sharply divided as
ever, with a distinct preponderance of it in favor of
letting the slavery question rest, so far as legislation
was concerned, where it had been placed by the
compromise measures of 1850. But the sentiment
in antagonism to slavery was everywhere growing
even among those who deprecated the agitation of
the subject.</p>
<p>The extreme opponents of slavery had taken more
advanced ground than ever before. They denounced
the Fugitive Slave Law as a statute which Congress
had no right to enact and which no citizen should obey.

<pb id="VAC0885-123" n="117"/>
                    
They pointed out that it was in violation of that very
doctrine of state sovereignty to which the advocates
of slavery had appealed. The ultra ones among them
planted themselves upon the doctrine first enunciated
by Mr. Seward of New York, that there is a "higher
law" than the statutes or the Constitution, and that
men of enlightened consciences were bound to obey
that higher law even to the extent of violating the
statutes, and setting the Constitution at naught.</p>
<p>The time had obviously come when there was no
longer any use in the adoption of compromises or the
passage of conciliatory laws by statesmen whose
first concern was for the preservation of the Union.
Compromises were no longer binding upon men's
consciences or conduct. Political parties refused to
regard them and even states in their organized capacity
legislated for their nullification, asserting their
right of sovereignty to that extent.</p>
<p>It is obvious that peace could not long continue in a
country thus violently divided against itself in opinion
and sentiment. Sooner or later by one means or
another, but with the same certainty that governs the
rising and the setting of the sun, such a condition
meant<hi rend="i">war</hi>. In this case it meant that within the
Union so afflicted there was an "irrepressible conflict"
of opinion, a conflict that would yield to no argument,
submit itself to no law, accommodate itself to no
circumstance and would stoutly insist upon irreconcilable
contentions on the one side and the other until
the matter should be decided by that last brutal
arbitrament of man, a conflict of cannon, musketry,
and mortars.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-124" n="118"/>
                    
<p>Precisely that condition of affairs had been reached
in the United States when the compromise measures
of 1850 were repudiated, defied and nullified by
both popular and legislative authority. Logically
the war between North and South should have occurred
then, and undoubtedly it would have occurred
at that time but for the persistence of that sentiment
of devotion to the Union which still dominated the
minds of a majority of men both at the North and
at the South.</p>
<p>It was in obedience to that sentiment that statesmen
refused to see the hopelessness of the situation
and went on endeavoring to find some way out of the
difficulty that should bring peace where there was no
peace, and save the Union from disruption.</p>
<p>The trouble with all such efforts was that everything
proposed by way of placating those on one
side of the controversy additionally inflamed those on
the other.</p>
<p>The most notable legislative outcome of this vexed
situation was the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, for which
Senator Douglas made himself sponsor. That bill
provided for the erection of the two territories, Kansas
and Nebraska, leaving it to those who should
settle within that domain to permit or exclude slavery
as they might please when the time should come for
them to apply for admission to the Union as states.
By direct implication at least slaves might freely
be taken into those territories during the period of
their territorial existence if the settlers there so
desired.</p>
<p>In justice to the memory of a patriotic statesman

<pb id="VAC0885-125" n="119"/>

who served his country to the best of his ability, it
is only fair that his doctrine and his opinions shall
be presented in his own words.</p>
<p>In the speech by which, in 1850, he placated the
animosity that had greeted him at Chicago, he set
forth his thought as follows:

<q rend="blockquote">
These measures [the compromise measures of 1850]
are predicated upon the great fundamental principle that
every people ought to possess the right of framing and
regulating their own internal concerns and domestic institutions
in their own way.... These things are all confided
by the constitution to each state to decide for itself, and I
know of no reason why the same principle should not be
extended to the territories.
</q>
</p>
<p>Three years later Mr. Douglas carefully set forth
his doctrine again in the Kansas-Nebraska Bill itself.
Referring to the Missouri Compromise, with its prohibition
of slavery in the states to be erected out of
Louisiana territory north of 36° 30´, the bill said:

<q rend="blockquote">
    
Which being inconsistent with the principle of non-intervention
by Congress with slavery in the states and territories,
as recognized by the legislation of 1850 . . . is hereby
declared inoperative and void; it being the true intent and
meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory
or state, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people
thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic
institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution
of the United States.
</q>
</p>
                    
<p>Mr. Douglas's doctrine, popularly known as
"Squatter Sovereignty," was open to criticism on
very obvious constitutional and historical grounds.</p>
<p>The original conception of the Union had undoubtedly

<pb id="VAC0885-126" n="120"/>

been that it was a confederacy of states, each
sovereign within itself except in so far as it had 
surrendered to the National Government a part of its
sovereignty by accepting the Federal Constitution
and entering the Union. It was deemed an axiom
that each state was free by the will of its own citizens
to regulate its domestic affairs in its own way, permitting
or forbidding slavery at its own free will.
After the great slavery controversy arose the South
contended still for this doctrine of states' rights, and
by the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, this sovereignty of the
states was extended to the territories also.</p>
<p>The student of history must observe however that
that doctrine had been very greatly impaired if not
indeed set aside by the act of Virginia in ceding her
claims in the Northwest Territory and the acceptance
of that cession by the general government. In that
cession it had been stipulated that slavery should
never be permitted in any of the territory thus made
a part of the national domain. The cession was made
with the direct intent that the region concerned should
presently be divided and admitted into the Union as
a number of states. But those states were thus forbidden
in advance to permit the existence of slavery
within their borders. So far as they were concerned,
therefore, the supposed right of a state to legislate at
will on that subject was taken away from them even
before their birth.</p>
<p>Here it would seem there was an abrogation or at
least an important modification of the doctrine of
the right of each state to determine this question for

<pb id="VAC0885-127" n="121"/>

itself, and that modification had been made by Virginia
and everywhere accepted.</p>
<p>The Missouri Compromise in precisely the same
manner had taken away that right of determination
from all the states that might be formed out of the
Louisiana territory lying north of the southern line
of Missouri. If the prohibition thus laid upon yet
unborn states was permissible as regards the cession
of the Northwest Territory it would seem to have
been equally so with regard to the new domain west
of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>Further than this the sovereign right of a state to
determine this question for itself did not extend at
any time to the territories. Under the Constitution
as uniformly interpreted by the Supreme Court of
the United States, Congress is supreme in the territories
and may make any law that it pleases for
their governance. In other words the people of the
territories have absolutely no rights of self-government
except such as Congress may from time to time
see fit to confer upon them.</p>
<p>This statement is not made speculatively or as an
opinion of the historian. It is a well settled doctrine
of constitutional law, affirmed by every court to which
the question has at any time been submitted.</p>
<p>Senator Douglas's Kansas-Nebraska Bill was based
upon an assumption precisely the reverse of this. It
extended to the territories a sovereignty which under
the Constitution belonged only to states, and which,
as has been suggested, the states themselves had in
a large degree surrendered by the acceptance of the
cession of the Northwest Territory.</p>

<p>With the aid of a considerable Northern vote in
Congress the South succeeded in passing the Kansas-
Nebraska Bill, repealing the Missouri Compromise,
and under the doctrine of "Squatter Sovereignty"
throwing all the territories open to slavery at least
as a possibility.</p>                    
<p>The North at once took alarm and the Free-soil
party, newly named the Republican party, grew in
numbers and enthusiasm as no other party had ever
done before.</p>
<p>Events mightily aided this growth, driving into the
Free-soil or Republican party many thousands of
men who had before held aloof from a movement
which they thought to be dangerous to the perpetuity
of the Union and to peace within its borders.</p>
<p>First of these events was the outbreak of civil
war in Kansas. The repeal of the Missouri Compromise
opened that territory at once to settlement by
men from both sections and at the same time opened
the question whether it should become a free or a slave
state. Incidentally a contest of factions began which
raged hotly to the end.</p>
<p>Whether Kansas should be a slave state or a free
state depended upon the will of the settlers alone.

<pb id="VAC0885-129" n="123"/>

The land was in many respects a tempting one to
emigrants in spite of the aridity of its western part,
so that even without any incentive of politics its
speedy settlement was quite a matter of course. But
politics North and South enormously aided in that behalf.
There was a rush from both sections to fill up
and occupy the land in order to control it. From the
Missouri border and from farther south slaveholders
and the representatives of slavery poured into the
territory in great numbers with the purpose of voting
it into the Union as a slave state. In the slang of the
period these were called "border ruffians." On the
other hand there was an "assisted emigration" from
the North, the emigration of men whose way was paid
in consideration of their votes and their rifle practice
against slavery in Kansas. These called themselves
"Free State Men" but they were called by their 
adversaries "Jayhawkers."</p>
<p>In order to promote the emigration of these men to
Kansas societies were formed in Massachusetts and
other states which not only paid their way but furnished
them with rifles of an improved pattern and
ammunition in plenty, with the distinct understanding
that it was their duty to ply both the bullet and the
ballot in aid of the cause they represented.</p>
<p>These two groups of men quickly fell by the ears,
as it was intended that they should, and civil war
in the strictest sense of that term ensued.</p>
<p>John Brown--an able, adventurous, and fanatical
man--took command of the free state forces and between
him and his adversaries there was a contest for
supremacy which involved every outrage to which

<pb id="VAC0885-130" n="124"/>

civil war, waged by uncivilized man, can give birth.
Small battles were fought. Men on either side were
shot or hanged without mercy. Homes were desolated.
Women and children were driven forth to
suffer all the agonies of starvation, of cold, and of
homelessness--all in aid of the voting one way or
the other.</p>
<p>In our time such a situation in a territory subject to
national control would be instantly ended by the
sending of troops to the disturbed region with instructions
to preserve order, to suppress all manner
of lawlessness, and to protect all citizens equally in
the enjoyment of the peaceful possession of the land.
But in the fifties the government of the United States
was still unused to such exercise of its authority--
parties were too evenly divided, political feeling was
too hot and voters were far too sensitive, to admit of
such a treatment of the situation as would in our
time seem quite a matter of course. Troops were sent
to Kansas, it is true, but in quite insufficient numbers
and under inadequate instructions. So the war
in Kansas went on and otherwise peaceful citizens of
the Union actively aided it upon the one side or the
other quite as if it had not been a civil war within
the Union and in a territory in which the authority of
Congress was supreme beyond even the possibility of
question.</p>
<p>At the South companies of armed men were organized,
equipped, and sent into Kansas nominally
to settle there and vote to make a slave state of the
territory, but really, if possible, to drive out every
"Free State" man or to overawe or overcome them

<pb id="VAC0885-131" n="125"/>

all, so that the voting might be all one way. At the
North similar companies of men were organized and
armed and aided to emigrate for the purpose of doing
very much the same thing to the representatives of
slavery and achieving a contrary result at the ballot
box.</p>
<p>Many of the men on both sides were not genuine
settlers at all but merely armed bandits engaged in a
mission of violence. Yet on both sides they were
supported, encouraged, and defended in their lawlessness
by the pulpit, the press, and every other
agency of civilization.</p>
<p>Elections were held in the territory in which both
sides voted their men without question as to their
age, the length of their residence within the territory
or any other qualification for voting which the loose
laws of the time provided. Every devilish device
of fraud and swindling that had up to that time been
invented by ingeniously unscrupulous politicians was
employed on the one side or the other without so
much as a qualm of conscience or a scruple of
conventionality.</p>
<p>It was <hi rend="i">war</hi> that these men were engaged in and
elections were a mere pretense. War habitually has
no scruples as to the means it uses for the overcoming
of an adversary. On each side men voted who had
arrived within the territory just in time for the election,
cheerfully perjuring themselves in order to do
so, an incident which nobody seemed to regard as a
serious matter. Each side voted its men as often as
it could under the loose election laws of the time and
in some cases that was very often. Ballot boxes were

<pb id="VAC0885-132" n="126"/>

stuffed with fraudulent votes by one side and were
seized and destroyed by the other.</p>
<p>Conventions fraudulently chosen by such practices
as these framed constitutions which were one after
another rejected by Congress.</p>
<p>The story need not be told here in further detail.
The struggle continued until the end of the decade
and it was not until after the Confederate War had
begun that the territory was admitted to the Union as
a state. In the meanwhile the eyes and minds of all
the people in the country were concentrated upon that
center of disturbance and the situation there enormously
increased the intensity of that acrimony which
already characterized the relations of men North and
South.</p>
<p>Another event which tended to increase the acrimony
between the two sections of the country and
ultimately to bring about war was the rendering of
the "Dred Scott" decision, which alarmed and intensely
angered the North.</p>
<p>Dred Scott was a negro slave in Missouri, owned
by an army surgeon who, about twenty years before,
had taken him as a servant to an army post in Illinois.
Under the laws of Illinois any slave taken by his
master into that state was by that act set free.</p>
<p>Dred Scott remained however in the position of a
slave and after a time he was taken back to Missouri.
There he was sold to a new master whom he presently
sued for assault on the ground that his former master
had in effect set him free by voluntarily taking him
into a free state, and that therefore he was not liable
to sale or to a chastisement at the hands of a master.</p>
                    
<pb id="VAC0885-133" n="127"/>

<p>The negro won in the lower courts but was defeated
upon appeal. Later, circumstances enabled him to
bring suit in the United States Court, and finally the
case went on appeal to the Supreme Court of the
United States. The questions directly and indirectly
involved in it were of so great national and political
interest that four of the greatest constitutional lawyers
in all the land volunteered to argue it--two of
them on the one side and two upon the other. The
argument was a contest of intellectual giants with the
whole country looking on and listening. At the end
of it the judgment of the court was rendered by Chief
Justice Taney in March, 1857. The decision negatived
all of Dred Scott's contentions and it affirmed
principles that were even more offensive to Northern
sentiment than its negations were. It amounted in
fact to a judgment that state laws setting free such
slaves as might be brought into the states concerned
by voluntary act of their masters were null and void.
It expressly declared unconstitutional that part of
the Missouri Compromise which forbade slavery in
territories north of 36° 30' north latitude.</p>
<p>So completely did the court decide upon the slavery
side of the question that Thomas H. Benton, the
great Democratic senator from Missouri, characterized
this deliberate and very carefully considered
judgment of the Supreme Court as one which made
slavery the organic law of the land with freedom as
a casual exception.</p>
<p>The victory of the pro-slavery radicals was here
complete. The decision gave them the definite judgment
of that Supreme Court whose decisions rise


<pb id="VAC0885-134" n="128"/>

above congressional enactment and set aside statutes,
--that court from whose judgments there is nowhere
any appeal to any other authority on earth--in behalf
of their most extreme contentions.</p>
<p>If that decision had been accepted by the people,
as the decisions of the Supreme Court usually are, it
would indeed have made slavery a national institution
subject only to such limitations as the individual
states might impose upon it within their own borders
and without interference with slaveholders who might
choose to take their slaves into free states and hold
them there.</p>
<p>But the victory of the slave advocates--complete
as it was--gave them no practical advantage. Such a
doctrine as that laid down by the court simply could
not find acceptance in the minds of men at the North.
Logically it ought not to have found acceptance with
the ultra pro-slavery men of the South for the reason
that it distinctly negatived that contention for states'
rights and state sovereignty upon which they relied
in their contest with their adversaries.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, in the course of his decision
Chief Justice Taney used one unhappy phrase
which gave even greater offense perhaps than the
decision itself did. That phrase was in fact no part
of the decision but was what the lawyers call an <hi rend="i">obiter
dictum</hi>--a saying apart. It was a mere statement of
what the Chief Justice believed to be a fact of history.
It was not at all a ruling of the court. As an illustration
of his meaning he made the perfectly true
statement that before the time of the American Revolution
--and he might have included a much later date

<pb id="VAC0885-135" n="129"/>

--the negroes <hi rend="i">"had been regarded</hi> as beings of an
inferior order and altogether unfit to associate with
the white race either in social or political relations;
and so far inferior that they had <hi rend="i">no rights which the
white man was bound to respect;</hi> and that the negro
might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for
his benefit."</p>
<p>This statement of fact as to the attitude of the
public mind toward the negro before the Revolution
was entirely correct, as every educated reader knows,
and as the history of the African slave-trade--carried
on not only before the adoption of the Constitution
but for a dozen years after 1808 when the constitutional
prohibition of that nefarious traffic went into
effect--perfectly and completely shows.</p>
<p>But Chief Justice Taney's simple statement of this
historical fact was everywhere interpreted to be a
part of his legal decision. This was natural enough
under the circumstances for the reason that slavery
itself, in behalf of which the decision seemed to have
been rendered, rested solely upon the doctrine that a
negro has no rights which the white man is bound
to respect.</p>
<p>Even if this unfortunate phrase had not been used
and even if it had not been misinterpreted as it was,
the decision itself must of necessity have wrought
something like a revolution in the thought of the
Northern people. The most conservative among them
had reconciled themselves to the existence of slavery
in certain of the states upon the ground that each
state had a right to legislate for itself upon that question
and therefore that each state was alone responsible

<pb id="VAC0885-136" n="130"/>

for its own legislation. They were startled now
by the challenge of a Supreme Court decision which
denied to them even this relief of conscience and even
this liberty of individual state action. They were
asked to accept the doctrine that slavery was a
national institution against which state laws were
futile except in a very limited way.</p>
<p>This extreme decision in favor of slavery, coming
as it did at the very time when civil war was on in
'Kansas, not only inflamed public sentiment at the
North but alarmed it. Already the political party
opposed to the extension of slavery had mightily
grown in numbers and in enthusiasm. In 1852 it had
cast less than 157,000 votes. In 1856 its vote
amounted to 1,841,264, carrying with it 114 electoral
votes as against 174 secured by its chief antagonist
and eight thrown away on a third candidate.</p>
<p>During that four years the Anti-slavery party had
drawn to itself through force of circumstance all of
the Free-soil Democracy and the greater part of the
Northern Whigs.</p>
<p>In 1856 for the first time in the Republic's history
the election of a president was contested by a party
strictly sectional in its composition and the fact was
alarming not only at the South but almost equally
so at the North. The conviction was general that
such a contest meant mischief for the country. It
was the first sure foreboding of that war which was
destined to come a little later between the sections.</p>
<p>The Republican party existed exclusively at the
North. It made no pretense of existing in the Southern
half of the Republic. It did not even go through

<pb id="VAC0885-137" n="131"/>

the empty form of nominating electors in the Southern
states either in 1856 or four years later in 1860.
It did not hope in either of those years for a single
electoral vote from any state lying south of the
Potomac or the Ohio. Its purpose was to carry the
election and to control the country by a strictly sectional
and geographical vote--a thing that had never
before been attempted or thought of by any party,
and a thing the very suggestion of which caused great
alarm throughout the country. For, men anxiously
asked, if one section of the Union is thus to dominate
the other how shall we be able to maintain the Union
in its present disturbed and distracted condition?
Hitherto, they reflected, majorities have been drawn
from all the states in contests that were purely
national in their inspiration and in their significance,
and all men have held themselves bound to submit to
the will of such majorities, as representing the ultimate
judgment of all the states and all the people;
but, they anxiously asked themselves, how long will
the states or the people of one part of the country
consent to be governed by the elected candidates of a
party which exists solely in the other part of the
country; a party which does not even ask for votes
except in that other part, in support of its candidates;
a party whose platform is one of avowed hostility
to the industrial, social and domestic labor system
of the southern half of the Republic; a party which
has no existence or recognition or representation in
that part of the Union, and which includes among
its most active and aggressive members those who
openly declare their purpose to overthrow the domestic

<pb id="VAC0885-138" n="132"/>

tic institutions of the South, in defiance of all constitutional
guarantees, and by any means that may be
available, even including servile war in states where
the negroes outnumber the whites by two or three
to one?</p>
<p>Considerations of this kind undoubtedly restrained
many voters at the North in the election of 1856, and
for a time after that election there seemed to be a
promise of peace in the influence of conservatism on
the one side and on the other in spite of what was
going on in Kansas.</p>
<p>At the same time the state of feeling throughout
the country was well-nigh indistinguishable from that
which prevails during the existence of actual civil war.
Only the old devotion to the Union which existed in
both the Northern and Southern mind prevented men
from flying at each other's throats.</p>
<p>Then, as if to emphasize the inevitableness of war
and to hasten its coming, there occurred the raid of
John Brown at Harper's Ferry, Virginia, in the
autumn of 1859--only a year before a presidential
election must occur.</p>
<p>John Brown had been the chief leader of the
Free State men in the warlike operations in Kansas.
He was a man of extraordinary fanaticism, limitless
daring, large capacity, and relentless determination.
His hostility to slavery knew absolutely no bounds.
With a courage which had no balance wheel of
discretion to regulate it, he had no hesitation in undertaking
great enterprises with ridiculously inadequate
means, and in the end he showed that he had no
flinching from the personal consequences of his acts.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-139" n="133"/>

<p>In June, 1859, he went secretly to the neighborhood
of Harper's Ferry, with a band so small that even
after its reinforcement it was manifestly inadequate
to be trusted by any but a madman to accomplish
the work that Brown had laid out for it to do.
He was both morally and materially supported by
men of wealth and influence at the North who blindly
entrusted him with arms, ammunition, and money, not
knowing or inquiring whither he was going or what
his purposes might be.</p>
<p>By the end of June, 1859, he had established himself
near Harper's Ferry with a band of devoted
followers about him. One by one the men who had
enlisted in his service joined him until the company
numbered twenty-two. Still his purpose was wholly
unsuspected by his Virginian neighbors.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the two hundred rifles contributed
by George L. Stearns of Medford, Mass., in aid of
the Kansas controversy, were delivered to John
Brown who had, besides, a war chest of five hundred
dollars in gold given to him by Boston enthusiasts
in aid of an enterprise concerning which they had
no definite information whatsoever.</p>
<p>His purpose was to establish in the mountain fastnesses
near Harper's Ferry a fugitive slave camp
which a few men could easily defend while the rest
of those coming into it could be run off to Canada and
freedom with ease and certainty. In effect he contemplated
a general insurrection of the slaves, their
concentration in easily defensible mountain camps
and their removal to Canada from these military
posts as rapidly as that end could be accomplished.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-140" n="134"/>
                    
<p>This program if successful could have resulted in
nothing less than a slave insurrection and a bloody
servile war.</p>
<p>But John Brown's program failed of its accomplishment
for two reasons. There was far less of
active discontent among the negroes of northern Virginia
than John Brown had supposed. Most of those
negroes in fact were entirely satisfied with their condition
and treatment and so they refused to flee to him
for rescue from an oppression which they did not feel.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that Frederick Douglass, the
ablest representative of the negro race and by all odds
the ablest negro representative of abolitionism, disapproved
and discouraged John Brown's enterprise.
Especially Frederick Douglass advised against John
Brown's policy of making war upon the United
States. That was the second and the controlling
cause of his failure. It seems to have been his thought
that with the country in the tempestuous condition it
was then in he might hopefully assail the National
Government itself and that in such an assault he
would have behind him the entire Northern people.
How badly he misunderstood the signs of the times
the events clearly show.</p>
<p>On the 16th of October, 1859, he marched with
eighteen men upon the undefended United States
arsenal at Harper's Ferry, broke down its doors and
took forcible possession of the premises.</p>
<p>This in itself was an easy thing to do for the reason
that the Government, seeing no occasion to apprehend
violence of such sort, had made no adequate
provision for the defense of its arsenal. But John

<pb id="VAC0885-141" n="135"/>

Brown's act was a direct, open, and flagrant levying
of war against the United States and it was promptly
treated as such by the Government at Washington.
A force of marines was sent to Harper's Ferry to
eject the intruder and to repossess the national
arsenal.</p>
<p>There was a little skirmish. Many of John Brown's
men were killed and he and his surviving companions
were promptly made prisoners, tried for treason,
convicted and hanged.</p>
<p>In the number of men engaged, in the amount of
damage done, and in its immediate consequences this
raid of John Brown's was a matter of no moment
whatever. It was conspicuously a failure so far as
its ulterior purpose of inducing slaves to flee from
bondage and engage in insurrection was concerned.
It was still more conspicuously a failure in so far
as it meant war upon the United States. A single
company of marines brought it to an end without the
necessity of calling in any larger force. But the
raid had a very important influence nevertheless, upon
the future history of the country.</p>
<p>It illustrated and emphasized as no previous event
had done, the implacability of the sentiment hostile
to slavery. It demonstrated, as the fact had never
been demonstrated before, the hopelessly irrepressible
character of the controversy concerning slavery. It
alarmed and angered the South as it had never been
alarmed and angered before. It indicated to the
Southern people the fact that there were agencies
active at the North which would stop at nothing that
might help to the abolition of slavery; that even a

<pb id="VAC0885-142" n="136"/>
                    
servile war, with all the brutality and bloodthirstiness
that servile war must mean to the South, was lightly
contemplated by a certain and rapidly growing
Northern opinion, as a legitimate means for the 
accomplishment of abolition. It indicated an implacability
of sentiment against which there seemed to
be no defense except in that dissolution of the Union
which the extremists on both sides had so long and
so freely invoked as a remedy for the hopeless division
of the Republic into two antagonistic camps.</p>
<p>John Brown's invasion would have counted for
little if it had stood alone. But the rifles that he had
in possession, with which to arm fugitive slaves, had
been contributed by a citizen of Massachusetts under
urgency of conspicuous representatives of the political
party that sought the abolition of slavery. The
five hundred dollars that Brown carried with him as
a part of the equipment with which he hoped to create
a servile war, was contributed by Boston citizens and
represented a hostility as unkind as it was unlawful.
The sanction given to John Brown's insane and treasonable
raid by many newspapers and a certain part
of the public at the North served to convince even
the most moderate and conservative men at the South
that there was no longer any hope or prospect of 
reconciliation between the two sections upon any basis
of reasonable and mutual concession.</p>
<p>It was in this mood that the country approached the
presidential election of 1860. On either side there
was a strongly surviving love for the Federal Union,
an abiding conviction that it alone could guarantee
the perpetuity of the American idea of local self-government

<pb id="VAC0885-143" n="137"/>

and personal liberty. But on either side
there was an aggressive party of disunion which
must be reckoned with in politics. On the side of the
North the disunionist party desired and insisted upon
the utter and immediate and unconditional abolition
of slavery as the sole condition of the Union's further
existence. On the Southern side the extremists demanded
that slavery should be recognized and protected
as a national institution, with local and state
freedom from it as a casual incident which should in
no way be permitted to interfere with the right of
the slaveholder to hold his slaves in bondage even
when his convenience led him to carry them into any
free state; and still further that the people of every
territory should be free to decide for themselves
whether or not slavery should be permitted within
the domain controlled by them. Between these two
opposing parties stood the overwhelming but rapidly
weakening majority of the people, insisting that the
perpetuity of the Union was of greater importance
to liberty than either the maintenance or the extinction
of slavery.</p>
<p>How these forces fought the matter out must be
the subject of another chapter.</p>

<p>When the time came to nominate candidates for
the presidential election of 1860, something akin to
despair had seized upon the minds of men--a despair
that discouraged hopeful conservatism and prompted
many to courses that could promise nothing other
than disaster to the Union.</p>
<p>In the event, the election of that year showed that
there was a majority of nearly a million votes against
the Republican party, in a total vote of about four
and a half millions. There was still an overwhelming
majority of the people, therefore, who regarded
the preservation and perpetuity of the Republic as
the paramount concern. There is every reason to
believe that if circumstances had so shaped themselves
as to put that matter immediately in issue, and
if the contest could have been fairly fought out between
the two opposing sentiments the majority of
nearly a million votes cast against what was regarded
as a sectional party, representing a purely geographical
sentiment, would have been swelled to two millions
or more. For in all parts of the country the
Union was still an object of adoration and the Constitution
remained a text-book of patriotic study.</p>
<p>But the battle was not destined to be fought out
on those lines. Those whose supreme concern was

<pb id="VAC0885-145" n="139"/>
                    
for the preservation of the Republic, with all that
it signified of self-government among men, were divided
in council and were in consequence defeated.
It sounds like a paradox, but it is a simple statement
of fact to say that the disruption of the Union
was brought about by the disunion of the Union
forces.</p>
<p>The story is an interesting bit of history and a most
significant one. But in order to understand it clearly
the reader should bear in mind the excessively strained
state of feeling in the country which has already
been set forth in these pages. In aid of that let us
briefly recapitulate.</p>
<p>The events of the recently preceding years had
gone far to unseat conservatism, to breed a hopeless
discouragement, and to induce a very general despair.
The civil war in Kansas had been lawless, criminal
and murderous on both sides.</p>
<p>It is impossible for any honest mind to approve the
doings of the men on either side in that struggle, or
to regard them otherwise than as criminal attempts to
substitute force for law and fraud for freedom of the
ballot.</p>
<p>Yet on each side the <hi rend="i">tu quoque</hi> argument was
freely and justly used; on either side the criminal
doings of the partisans of that side were regarded as
a necessary offset to the criminal doings of the partisans
of the other side. At the North the "free state
men" were encouraged and supported by a large part
of the press and pulpit. Great preachers pleaded
from their sacred desks for contributions of money
with which to arm the Northern men for this conflict.


<pb id="VAC0885-146" n="140"/>

Great leaders of radical opinion employed the press
and platform in the like behalf.</p>
<p>On the other hand, at the South, with a far less
orderly organization of the forces that control popular
opinion and action, there was an equally strong
disposition manifested to support and encourage
those Southern youths who had gone into Kansas to
struggle for the establishment of slavery there. And
on each side there was a manifest willingness to shut
eyes to such lawlessness and such crime as the partisans
of that side might find it necessary and convenient
to commit in behalf of the "cause" they were
set to serve.</p>
<p>Then had followed John Brown's attempt at
Harper's Ferry to bring about that most terrible
of all catastrophes, a slave insurrection. The attempt
itself was so absurd in its lack of means conceivably
adequate to the end proposed, and so clearly the work
of a madman in that it involved a direct assault upon
a national arsenal, making itself thus the insane challenge
of a mere handful of men to the whole power of
the United States, that it might have been dismissed
from men's minds as men are accustomed to dismiss
the vagaries of demented persons, but for one fact.
The John Brown raid was seriously and earnestly approved
by so many persons and pulpits and prints at
the North, as was shown by funeral services and
otherwise, that it was regarded at the South as a
preliminary, typical, and threateningly suggestive
manifestation of what Northern sentiment intended
to do to the South whenever it should have the necessary
power. How largely it was thus sanctioned

<pb id="VAC0885-147" n="141"/>

was later shown by the fact that during the succeeding
war the song that celebrated John Brown's raid
made itself a national anthem declaring that in the
advance of the national armies his "soul was marching
on."</p>
<p>To the Southern people John Brown's attempt
to stir up servile insurrection meant all of horror, all
of slaughter, all of outrage to women and children
that it is possible to conceive. It meant to them the
overturning of society. It meant the dominance of a
subject and inferior race outnumbering the whites
in many states, a race ignorant and passionate in
Virginia and Kentucky, and well-nigh savage in the
cotton states. It meant rapine and murder--rape,
outrage and burning.</p>
<p>There were still many at the South who desired and
earnestly advocated the extirpation of slavery by any
means that could be adopted with tolerable safety to
Southern homes, but John Brown's program of abolition
by servile war--a program which seemed to
them to be accepted by Northern public sentiment--
offered them a threat of desolation against which,
if they were men, they were bound to revolt with
all the force they could command. It called into instant
and aggressive activity that fundamental impulse
of humanity, the all-controlling instinct of self-
preservation.</p>
<p>On the other side the increasingly insistent demand
of the Southern extremists for the nationalization of
slavery and their apparent ability to force such
nationalization, through fugitive slave laws against
which the consciences even of the most devoted lovers

<pb id="VAC0885-148" n="142"/>

of the Union at the North revolted, and through the
decisions of the Supreme Court, bred in that quarter
a similar despair of lasting union. Hundreds of thousands
who did not sympathize with the purpose to
stir up servile war despairingly felt that the time
had come when the demands of what was called
"the slave power" must be resisted at any and all
risks, and resigned themselves to the employment of
any means that might be found necessary to that
end. They felt that all compromises had failed, that
all efforts to enable this Nation, as Mr. Lincoln
phrased it, "permanently to endure half slave and
half free," had been defeated and shown to be futile.</p>
<p>In brief, on both sides of the line of cleavage, a
spirit of despairing readiness for any remedy, however
drastic it might be, had been created by the inexorable
circumstances of the "irrepressible conflict."</p>
<p>There is no doubt whatever that if the situation had
been clearly understood, nine in ten of all Northern
people would have shrunk with horror from such a
program of destruction as that which John Brown's
raid implied and intended--namely the overthrow of
the United States Government and the inauguration
of a servile insurrection at the South.</p>
<p>But the conditions were not clearly understood
upon either side. Upon neither side did the people
really know precisely how the facts of the situation
presented themselves to the people on the other side.
On neither side was there enough of calm, impartial
deliberation to distinguish between the excesses of
sentiment and conduct and provoking self-assertion
on the part of extremists on the other side and the

<pb id="VAC0885-149" n="143"/>

settled purposes of the great majority. Still worse,
on neither side was there enough resolute calmness
to relegate the small body of extremists to their
proper place as a minority, and to take matters out
of their hands.</p>
<p>The thought of secession rapidly gained ground
at the South. The "slangy" slogan of N. P. Banks
--"Let the Union slide"--was accepted as a policy
by increasing multitudes at the North.</p>
<p>It was in such conditions that political parties made
their preparations for the presidential campaign of
1860.</p>
<p>The Democratic party represented the only opposition
to Republicanism  which had any hope or
possibility of success. It was in a clear and commanding
majority in the Nation. The old Whig party had
dwindled to a remnant, and the greater part of that
remnant would have voted for the Democratic candidate
in an election directly presenting the issue of
Democracy and nationalism against Republicanism
and a geographical division of the people into parties.</p>
<p>But the Democratic party was itself hopelessly
divided. The radical pro-slavery men at the South
had made up their minds to disunion as a thing desirable
and necessary. They did not want the
Democratic or any other national party to win unless
they could themselves dominate and control it. The
extreme men among them wanted the Republicans to
succeed in the election in order that there might be an
excuse for secession.</p>
<p>The Democratic nominating convention met at
Charleston, S. C., on April 23, 1860. Senator

<pb id="VAC0885-150" n="144"/>

Stephen A. Douglas from the beginning was the first
choice of a majority of the delegates as the party's
candidate, but he could not command that two-thirds'
vote which the party had always insisted upon as
a condition precedent to nomination. In his Illinois
campaign against Lincoln in 1858, Douglas had
been logically forced to make certain admissions as
to the right of the people in a territory to exclude
slavery from it before it became a state, which deeply
offended the extremists of the South. There was
also in effective play the active desire of these extremists
to disrupt the party and secure its defeat as a
pretext for secession. To have nominated Douglas
at that time would have been to elect him with absolute
certainty, and to have elected him in 1860 would have
been to postpone the program of secession for at least
four years.</p>
<p>So from the beginning to the end the radical pro-
slavery men held out against Douglas's nomination.
They in the end seceded from the convention and
after ten days of fruitless wrangling that body adjourned
without making a nomination or adopting a
platform, to meet again at Baltimore on the eighteenth
of June.</p>
<p>This second meeting of the convention was the
signal for still further and bitterer wrangling. The
Southerners again withdrew and in the end two candidates
were nominated-Douglas by that part of the
convention which claimed to be national and Breckinridge
by the Southern wing.</p>
<p>This was a direct invitation to defeat. It not only
compelled such a division of the Democratic vote as

<pb id="VAC0885-151" n="145"/>

to render the success of either Democratic candidate
impossible, but it was accompanied by the still further
division of the forces opposed to the strictly sectional
and geographical Republican party. The old Whigs
and those in sympathy with their desire to preserve
the Union if possible, had met in convention in Baltimore
on the ninth of May, adopted, as their platform,
resolutions pledging devotion to "the Union,
the Constitution and the enforcement of the laws,"
and under the name of "the Constitutional Union
party" nominated John Bell of Tennessee for president
and Edward Everett of Massachusetts for
vice-president.</p>
<p>Their purpose was to bring to bear for the preservation
of the Union the votes. of a large body of men
who would not vote for the Republican candidate on
the one hand or for either of the Democratic candidates
--presently to be nominated--on the other.
Their hope was that among four candidates there
would be no election, and that in an election by states
in the House of Representatives their candidate
might be chosen as one upon whom lovers of the
Union could unite without regard to party.</p>
<p>When the election came they polled no less than
589,581 votes and carried thirty-nine electoral votes
against Douglas's twelve and Breckinridge's seventy-
two. But their hope of throwing the election into
the House of Representatives was doomed to disappointment.</p>
<p>The Republican convention met at Chicago on May
16, and after some contest nominated Mr. Lincoln.
When all the nominations were made, presenting

<pb id="VAC0885-152" n="146"/>

three candidates in opposition to him, Mr. Lincoln's
election was practically certain, with only the remote
chance that the choice might be thrown into the
House of Representatives, as a possible doubt of that
result. In fact he was elected, though the majority
against him on the popular vote was nearly a million.</p>
<p>In the meantime the canvass had mightily tended
to additional embitterment. It had drawn the line
more sharply than ever between the sections. It had
completely disrupted and scattered into three warring
groups all those forces that stood out against a
party which had no being except in one section of the
Union. It had familiarized men's minds with the
idea of disunion. It had been a campaign of threats
and defiances. It had well-nigh made an end of conservatism
as a sentiment influential on either side. It
had intensified distrust, accentuated hatred, embittered
the relations of men, and prepared the minds
of the people North and South for disunion and war.</p>
<p>The time had come which statesmen had so long
foreboded when threats of disunion--oft repeated on
both sides and usually received scoffingly as mere
vaporings--took on a seriously menacing character.
The time had come when the warring sectional interests,
prejudices and principles were ready to make
final appeal to the brutal arbitrament of steel and
gunpowder. The situation had been strained to the
breaking point, and the fact that it did not break at
once was due to conditions and inspirations which
need another chapter for their explanation.</p>

<p>The election of Mr. Lincoln filled the whole country
with alarmed apprehension. At the North no less
than at the South men anxiously asked of themselves
and of their neighbors "What is going to happen?"</p>
<p>What had already happened was something 
unprecedented in the history of the country. On its face
it was merely the election of a president by a majority
of the electoral college vote, against whose election
there had been a heavy popular majority.</p>
<p>The like had happened several times before and
the occurrence had never before excited the least apprehension
or created the least alarm or suggested
the smallest protest. It had been accepted in every
case as a natural result of our complex electoral system,
which combines representation of population
with representation of the states as such without regard
to population, and which gives to each state the
right to cast the whole of its electoral vote in accordance
with the will of a majority of its people. It
was a recognized fact that under this system a president
might easily be chosen by a minority vote of the
people, provided that minority vote was so distributed
among the states as to secure an electoral majority
in his behalf. There was no ground of complaint,
therefore, and in fact no complaint was anywhere

<pb id="VAC0885-154" n="148"/>

made, that Mr. Lincoln was elected in the face of an
adverse majority of about 950,000 popular votes.</p>
<p>But there was a much more significant, and, as it
seemed to many minds, a much more alarming fact
behind his election. That election was purely and
exclusively sectional. Of the one hundred eighty
electoral votes cast for him, not one had come from
any state lying south of the Potomac or the Ohio
nor had his candidacy been supported in the popular
vote by even a handful in that half of the country.
Both on the popular and on the electoral vote his support
had been purely geographical, and even on geographical
lines it had been little more than a majority.
In the slave states he had had no support at all, while
in the free states taken by themselves his popular majority
was only 186,964, the vote of the free states
standing 1,7831,182 for him and 1,544,218 against him.</p>
<p>In other words, Mr. Lincoln was elected in face of
an adverse popular majority of about 950,000 in the
whole country, by a narrow popular majority of less
than 200,000 in one section of the country. He was
the candidate of a party which had absolutely no
existence in the southern part of the Republic, and
which existed avowedly only in antagonism to the
institutions of that part of the country.</p>
<p>For the first time in the history of the Republic
there had occurred a purely geographical election.
For the first time, as the South interpreted the matter,
one section of the country had assumed the right to
govern another. For the first time a party dominating
one section by a narrow majority and having
no shadow of existence in the other section had come

<pb id="VAC0885-155" n="149"/>

into power with authority to rule both, so far at
least as executive and administrative power was concerned.
For the first time that geographical division
of the country had occurred in fear and dread of
which as a possibility so many of the original states
had hesitated to ratify the Constitution itself.</p>
<p>Worse still, so far as the future of the Republic
was concerned, this purely geographical election had
been sought and secured upon a purely geographical
and sectional question. Refine the matter as the 
platform-makers might, and qualify and explain policies
as the party did, the fact was as apparent then as it
is now that the sole reason for the Republican party's
existence was hostility to slavery and an earnest desire
to abolish that institution in this land by whatever
means there might be available to that end. That
purpose alone held together in political union the
otherwise discordant elements of which the party was
composed. In other words a party founded exclusively
upon hostility to the domestic institutions of
the Southern States had elected a president by means
of a purely sectional and geographical vote, against
the expressed will of the people as reflected in a
popular majority of nearly a million ballots.</p>
<p>These facts of history are here set forth not by way
of condemnation and not at all with any intent to
criticise them or the authors of them adversely, but
solely in aid of understanding. They are set forth
in order that the reader who was not born early
enough in the nineteenth century to remember them
may understand the conditions and circumstances
that gave birth to the war.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-156" n="150"/>
                    
<p>The election of Mr. Lincoln under these circumstances
and in this way was accepted by the extreme
pro-slavery men at the South as a challenge to them
to dissolve the Union if they dared. They proceeded
to accept the challenge, but their influence was not
dominant in Virginia or in those states which looked
to Virginia for guidance in this crisis and the lack of
such dominance was an embarrassment to them.
South Carolina, in which state the extremists were
most influential, adopted an ordinance of secession on
the twentieth of December, 1860. The other cotton
states followed South Carolina's lead until seven of
them were counted as seceding states. But Virginia
resolutely held aloof, and North Carolina, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Arkansas, and Missouri awaited Virginia's
leadership, while Maryland and Delaware stood firmly
by the Union.</p>
<p>Without these states the attempt to disrupt the
Union would of course have been an absurdity from
the beginning. But unless Virginia could be drawn
into the movement the other border states were resolute
to withhold themselves from it, for the double
reason that Virginia's influence as the mother of the
states concerned was paramount, and that Virginia's
geographical position, the numbers of her population,
her importance in American history and her
productiveness of those supplies upon which military
operations must depend, rendered that state an absolutely
indispensable member of the new Confederacy
if its war of independence was to be in the least
degree hopeful of success.</p>
<p>The seceding states sent delegates to a convention

<pb id="VAC0885-157" n="151"/>

at Montgomery, Alabama, in early February, 1861,
and there set themselves up as a new and independent
republic under the name of "The Confederate States
of America." But neither Virginia nor the other
border states were represented in that convention.</p>                   
<p>Virginia, on the fourth of February, elected a constitutional
convention to consider the question of secession.
The result of that election was altogether
hostile to the purposes of the secessionists. An overwhelming
majority of the convention elected on that
date consisted of men resolutely opposed to the policy
of secession.</p>
<p>Here a nice distinction must be made. The Virginians
generally, and their accredited representatives
in the constitutional convention, believed absolutely
and without a shadow of questioning in the constitutional
right of any state to secede from the Union at
will. They agreed also in the conviction that the
National Government had no constitutional right or
power to use force of any kind in order to prevent
the secession of any state or in order to compel its
return to the Union.</p>
<p>But while they held these doctrines to be absolutely
indisputable, the Virginians resolutely rejected secession
as a policy. They saw nothing in Mr. Lincoln's
election to justify a resort to so extreme a
remedy, and they refused their assent to that method
of procedure. It is important to bear in mind the
distinction between the Virginian conception of states'
rights and the Virginian conception of policy in the
conditions created by Mr. Lincoln's election, because
upon that distinction hung the issue of peace or war

<pb id="VAC0885-158" n="152"/>
                    
in the Republic. For nothing could be more certain
than that without Virginia's pith and substance, and
without the assistance of the states that waited for
Virginia's decision before rendering their own, the
cotton states would not have undertaken, seriously, a
war of independence, or if they had done so, would
not have been able to maintain their struggle against
the Federal power for any considerable time.</p>
<p>Everything hinged upon Virginia's course and
Virginia resolutely repudiated the policy of secession,
denying that Mr. Lincoln's election afforded any
just occasion or any sufficient excuse for a resort to
that extreme remedy.</p>
<p>Accordingly all the forces of secession were brought
to bear upon Virginia. All the hotheads in the
state and many from other states, were set to make
speeches. Most of the newspapers were purchased
and placed in control of intemperate radicals who
could be depended upon to make life not worth living
for any man who hesitated to precipitate war. John
M. Daniel, a gifted man of extreme views and highly
intemperate prejudices, came home from his consular
mission abroad and resumed control of his newspaper,
the Richmond <hi rend="i">Examiner</hi>, only to make of its
columns a daily terror to every man in the convention
or out of it who ventured to hope for peace and the
perpetuity of the Union, through the efforts of John
J. Crittenden's peace conference or through any other
conceivable agency of compromise or reconciliation.
Commodore, and afterwards Admiral, Farragut--
himself a Southerner, and a resident at that time of
Virginia,--said that Virginia was "dragooned out of

<pb id="VAC0885-159" n="153"/>

the Union." The phrase is not quite accurately descriptive
of what happened, but at any rate it correctly
describes the attempts made to compel Virginia's
secession and to secure with it the addition of all
the strength of all the border states to the newly
formed Confederacy.</p>
<p>The dragooning was attempted, but Virginia refused
to yield. Her convention, undoubtedly representing
with accuracy the will of her people, held out
in opposition to every suggestion of the state's
withdrawal from the Union.</p>
<p>Virginia stood thus as a bulwark against civil war
for more than two moons, and there is little doubt
that her influence and her attitude would have been
effectual in preventing the war if only a technicality
had been put aside in order that Virginia might not
be forced to array herself against that Union of
which she was largely the author and to which she
still clung with loyal allegiance.</p>
<p>When in the middle of April, 1861, after the bombardment
of Fort Sumter, Mr. Lincoln issued a call
for 75,000 men to form an army with which to coerce
the seceding states into submission, and included Virginia
in that call, the Virginians felt themselves bound
to choose between a secession for which they saw no
possible occasion, on the one hand, and the lending of
Virginia's power on the other to a program of coercion
for which they recognized no constitutional warrant
and no moral right. In making such a choice
they saw but one honorable course open to them. A
convention which had stood out against secession in
face of vituperation, contumely and every other force

<pb id="VAC0885-160" n="154"/>

that could be brought to bear in that behalf, voted
for secession at the last as an alternative to injustice
and dishonor.</p>
<p>This act--which the wisely diplomatic omission of
Virginia from the call for troops would have averted
--made the war not only possible but a fact.
But this is getting well ahead of the story. Let
us go back.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln was elected on the sixth of November,
1860. He could not take his seat until the fourth of
March, 1861. In the meantime the Government must
remain in the hands of the peculiarly irresolute administration
of James Buchanan, whose sole concern
seemed to be to postpone the outbreak of actual hostilities
until the expiration of his own term of office.</p>
<p>Commissioners were sent to him from the seceding
states to arrange for the peaceful dissolution of the
Union. He had no constitutional power to negotiate
with them and he very properly refused to receive
them in their official capacity. But on the other hand
he did absolutely nothing to prevent or to check or
in any way to interfere with the organization of the
seceding states as a power in open resistance to the
Union. It is a fact now apparent to all students of
history that but for Virginia's refusal to join the
secession movement, carrying with it as it did the
refusal of the other border states, there would have
been an organized power ready, upon Mr. Lincoln's
accession to office, to assert and maintain the independence
of the Southern states against any force
that the North could have brought to bear against
them.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-161" n="155"/>
                    
<p>The regular United States army at that time was
ridiculously inadequate in numbers to undertake any
enterprise of consequence. Its feeble forces were
scattered from Maine to Texas, from Florida to
Oregon. Its hands were more than full with the task
of holding the Indians in subjection and protecting
the borders against the ravages of savage war. The
Buchanan administration called no volunteers into the
field, while in every Southern state there were musterings
at every county seat and military organizations
of a formidable character.</p>
<p>In the meantime the newly elected president and
those who supported him had no opportunity to
make preparation for meeting these conditions. They
were not even privileged to advise.</p>
<p>The administration that still remained in power was
rapidly disintegrating. Four of the cabinet officers
resigned their places, thus still further paralyzing the
hands of the President. At the North there was a
fixed conviction that secession was merely a bit of
political play which would never be pushed to the
point of actual war and consequently there was very
little of military preparation, while all the able-bodied
young men of the South, rind even of Virginia, which
so emphatically refused to secede, were organizing
and drilling and holding themselves in readiness for
whatever might happen.</p>
<p>But everywhere there was apprehension. From
the hour of the election returns iri November until the
incoming of Mr. Lincoln's administration on the
fourth of March, conservative men at the North and
at the South anxiously busied themselves in an 

<pb id="VAC0885-162" n="156"/>

endeavor to find a way out of the difficulty, to save the
Union from disruption and the country from civil
war.</p>
<p>On the second day of December the Albany
<hi rend="i">Evening Journal</hi>, a newspaper edited by Thurlow
Weed and the personal organ of Mr. Seward, appealed
strongly and even passionately to patriotism
throughout the country for "such moderation, and
forbearance as will draw out, combine and strengthen
the Union sentiment of the whole country."</p>
<p>But this and like appeals made by Union-loving,
patriotic men North and South fell, not so much upon
deaf ears as upon the ears of those who had lost
control of their respective parties. Had the conservative
men of the Nation been able to act together,
they must undoubtedly have prevailed for peace in
virtue of their majority of a million, but on both sides
the radicals had seized upon the reins. At the South
the secessionists were rejoicing in Mr. Lincoln's election
under circumstances that gave excuse for the
dissolution of the Union. At the North the radical
abolitionists saw and welcomed in that event an opportunity
to use the whole power of the Federal
Government for the final extirpation of African slavery.
At the North and at the South the extremists
were in control, chiefly by virtue of their intensity
and their clamor.</p>
<p>On neither side did the radicals desire the preservation
of the Union; on neither side did they seek any
amicable adjustment of the controversy. On the contrary
they invoked controversy, invited disunion and
courted war.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-163" n="157"/>

<p>In Congress many efforts were made to find a plan
and a basis of adjustment. By a vote of 145 to 38
the House of Representatives created a committee
of one member from each state to consider the state
of the Union and to report measures of pacification.
The Senate adopted measures of like purport.</p>
<p>In that body Andrew Johnson of Tennessee--
afterwards president--deliberately proposed a constitutional
amendment to the effect that thereafter
the president and vice-president should be chosen the
one from the North and the other from the South
and that the two sections should alternately enjoy the
advantage of furnishing the incumbent of the higher
office.</p>
<p>Even at that excited and unreasoning time there
was probably no more insane proposal made than this.
It would have put sectionalism into the Constitution
itself. It would have limited both parties in their
choice of candidates to men resident in one section
or in the other; it would have made of the so-called
Mason and Dixon's line a divisional boundary over
which no political power, no popular preference, no
vote, however overwhelming, could step; it would
have changed the United States from the condition
of a single, federal republic in which all the states
and all citizens were possessed of equal rights into a
bifurcated alliance between two antagonistic groups
of states, the chief bond of union between which
would have been an agreement that they should alternately
govern each other.</p>
<p>Surely nothing more senseless, more absurd or
more impracticable than this was ever proposed in

<pb id="VAC0885-164" n="158"/>

any country by anybody pretending to be a statesman.
But the fact that it was seriously proposed
and earnestly urged by a senator who at the next
election was nominated and elected vice-president
and who became president by virtue of Mr. Lincoln's
assassination, is suggestive at least and illustrative
of the intensity with which the country and its statesmen
were at that time longing for a way out of the
difficulty and endeavoring to find it.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the radicals and extremists on
both sides laughed and jeered at all such endeavors
to save a Union which they had doomed to destruction
by their common fiat, though in nothing else
were they agreed. They found means of thwarting
every effort of conservatism, and, by intemperate
and incessant vituperation, they succeeded in driving
many thousands out of the ranks of patriotic conservatism
on the one side or the other, and into support
of their demand for disunion, chaos and black
night.</p>
<p>It was frankly recognized by many leaders of public
opinion at the North, that the Southerners were
somewhat justified in their attitude by their misconception
of the Republican party's purposes and
views, a misconception to which the intemperate utterances
of extreme anti-slavery men, very naturally
ministered. It was in recognition of this natural
misunderstanding that Senator Benjamin F. Wade,
himself an earnest and even extreme anti-slavery
man, said in the Senate, two days before South Carolina
seceded:</p>
<p>"I do not so much blame the people of the South,

<pb id="VAC0885-165" n="159"/>
                    
because I think they have been led to believe that
we, to-day the dominant party, who are about to take
the reins of government, are their mortal foes, and
stand ready to trample their institutions under foot."</p>
<p>That was precisely what the Southern people believed.
They were firmly convinced that the success
of the Republican party meant a merciless, relentless,
implacable war upon their labor and social system and
upon themselves as the supporters and beneficiaries
of that system.</p>
<p>Nevertheless they clung to the Union and labored
for its preservation. Virginia supported by the other
border states made every effort to secure a pacification.</p>
<p>Chief among these efforts was that made in Congress
by John J. Crittenden of Kentucky. On the
nineteenth of December, the day before South Carolina's
adoption of the ordinance of secession, Mr.
Crittenden offered a series of resolutions in the Senate
which were designed to compose the troubles of
the time and to furnish a basis of peaceful settlement.
Mr. Crittenden proposed amendments to the Constitution
providing:</p>
<p>1. That slavery should be prohibited in all territories
north of the Missouri Compromise line while
they remained territories and freely permitted in all
territories south of that line, but with the provision
that every state to be formed out of such territory,
whether lying north or south of that line, should be
free to decide for itself whether or not as a state it
would permit slavery.</p>
<p>2. That Congress should have no power to abolish

<pb id="VAC0885-166" n="160"/>

slavery in any place subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the United States--meaning, of course, the
District of Columbia, the public reservations and the
territories. It was especially provided that Congress
should at no time abolish slavery in the District of
Columbia without the consent of the state of Maryland
and of the owners of slaves within the District.</p>
<p>3. That Congress should not in any way forbid
the traffic in slaves from one slave state to another.</p>
<p>4. That the United States should be liable for the
value of any fugitive slave whose recapture should
be prevented by force or by intimidation and that the
county in which the force or intimidation had been
used should be liable to the United States for the
mulct.</p>
<p>There were other details which need not here be considered
in view of the general absurdity of the proposal.
Not even Andrew Johnson's plan, already set
forth, embodied more conspicuous elements of impossibility.
The Northern States would never have
consented to these constitutional provisions. The
Southern States would never have been satisfied with
them, because they carried with them no effectual
provision for their own enforcement. It was folly
and futility, from beginning to end, but at any rate
it was patriotic folly and country-loving futility. It
represented the dominant desire of the people to find
some basis of reconciliation upon which the crumbling
foundations of the Union might be rebuilt and
securely buttressed.</p>
<p>The proposal--absurd and impossible as it was--
was strongly supported both in Congress and in the

<pb id="VAC0885-167" n="161"/>

country. Mr. Pugh of Ohio expressed in the Senate
the opinion that it would command the support of
nearly every state in the Union, and he pointed out
the fact that no other proposal ever submitted to Congress
had been supported by the petitions of so great
a multitude of citizens. The conservative newspaper
press passionately urged its adoption, declaring it to
be a measure which would completely disarm the disunion
sentiment on both sides, and suggesting to Mr.
Seward that one word from him in its behalf would
make a final end of the fearful threat of war which
overshadowed the country.</p>
<p>But all these urgings were founded upon neglect
to consider the all-controlling fact that the conflict
between slavery and anti-slavery had become actually
irrepressible, with the added element of what Charles
Sumner called a "sacred animosity."</p>
<p>There was an active, aggressive, anti-slavery minority
at the North whose members cared not one pinpoint's
worth for the Union except in so far as they
hoped to use its power for the abolition of slavery
in any way and upon any terms that might be available.
They had already declared their hostility to
the Constitution, and the insertion of Mr. Crittenden's
amendments into that document would have served
only to intensify their hatred of it and to stimulate
their purpose to be rid of it. On the other hand
there was an active and ceaselessly aggressive pro-
slavery party at the South whose members were resolutely
bent upon the destruction of the Union in
order that a new Republic might be founded with
African slavery as its corner stone.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-168" n="162"/>

<p>Between these two radical parties there could be
no peace and no neutral ground upon which to negotiate
a peace. Each held the Union in contempt--
the one because the Constitution protected slavery,
the other because it did not adequately protect that
institution. Each was ready to sacrifice the Union if
by such sacrifice it might achieve its cherished purposes.
The one had decried the Union and its Constitution
as "a league with death and a covenant
with hell" but now clung to it as a power that might
be conveniently used for the accomplishment of cherished
purposes. The other had despaired of its hope
of using the Federal power further for its own ends.
The Southern extremists wished to destroy the Union
in order that its power might not be used for the extirpation
of slavery; the Northern extremists, who
had formerly been equally willing to "let the Union
slide," were now eager for its preservation in order
that its tremendous potentialities of force and compulsion
might be employed in behalf of that extirpation
of slavery for which alone they cared.</p>
<p>Neither of these extreme parties in the least degree
sympathized with any effort to preserve the Union
for its own sake by measures of compromise and reconciliation.
The Northern radicals wanted the South
to secede in order that military force might be employed
for the compulsory abolition of slavery. The
Southern radicals wanted the Union dissolved in
order that slavery might be no further interfered
with.</p>
<p>Neither at the North nor at the South were the
radicals even yet in a majority. But in both sections

<pb id="VAC0885-169" n="163"/>

they held a sort of balance of power and in both they
were in effect dominant.</p>
<p>Under such conditions, with a conflict so truly and
hopelessly irrepressible confronting the country, what
conceivable hope was there of a peaceful adjustment
by means of Mr. Crittenden's resolutions, or by any
other means that patriotic ingenuity might devise?</p>
<p>The first gun had not yet been fired, but there
was war on, nevertheless, and no paper resolutions
however plausibly phrased could stop its progress to
the cannon and musket stage.</p>
<p>Mr. Crittenden's proposal of Amendments to the
Constitution did not and could not command the two-
thirds majority in Congress necessary to their submission
to the several states for ratification. The cry
of the Northern extremists was "No backing down!
No inch of concession to the slave power! No surrender
of the fruits of the victory we have won!"
The cry of the Southern radicals was: "There is no
use in paper guarantees! We cannot trust them!
Our enemies have not kept faith in the past and will
not keep faith in the future. Let us abandon the
hopeless effort for compromises that cannot be enforced!
Let us secede and set up a new republic of
our own!"</p>
<p>Then came Virginia into the breach, as she had so
often come before. Standing as she did for conservatism
and for that Union which her legislature
had been the first to suggest and which her statesmen
had done so much to bring into beneficient being, she
appealed to the sentiment of Union and patriotism
throughout the land. Her legislature asked that all

<pb id="VAC0885-170" n="164"/>
                    
the states should appoint delegates to a great peace
conference at Washington, whose statesmanlike duty
it should be to devise and agree upon some plan of
adjustment by which the danger that overshadowed
the Republic might be averted. This appeal for
peace was made on the nineteenth day of January,
1861,--more than a fortnight before the date appointed
for the election of a constitutional convention
in Virginia to consider the crisis.</p>
<p>It is idle to speculate upon the "might have been."
What actually happened was that many of the states
appointed to that peace conference delegates of radical
views and intemperate minds, whose endeavors
from first to last were ceaselessly devoted not to the
task of finding a way out, but to the preconceived
purpose of defeating the objects of the peace conference.</p>
<p>In the end a committee of that body did indeed
recommend a policy practically identical with that
outlined in Mr. Crittenden's proposed amendments
to the Constitution. But the extremists on both sides
and especially the politicians on both sides who sniffed
preferment in the air of radicalism, were by that
time so far dominant that the proposal came to
nothing. It failed of acceptance in either house of
Congress when put to a vote within a brief time before
the end of the session.</p>                   
<p>Nevertheless Virginia still resolutely held out
against secession and five other border states stood
by her in that patriotic attitude for a month and a
half more.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln was inaugurated on the fourth of


<pb id="VAC0885-171" n="165"/>
                    
March, and straightway there set in a rivalry among
the Republican leaders for the control of his administration.
Even those who had most actively aided
in his election gravely misunderstood and seriously
underestimated the character of the man they had
chosen to be president. They assumed from the beginning
that somebody, other than himself, must
direct his administration, and there was eager rivalry
among them to usurp that function.</p>
<p>They did not know Abraham Lincoln or realize his
intellectual or moral power. The extreme abolitionists
beset him with plans to make war upon the seceding
states with the avowed purpose of abolishing
slavery in all the states by the high hand and without
regard to that Constitution which they had declared
to be a "league with death and a covenant with hell."
To these Mr. Lincoln replied that while they were
free to advocate any policy they pleased, he at least,
was bound by his official oath to support and maintain
the Constitution of the United States. In the end,
of course, and when strenuous war was on he did indeed
take a different view. As a "war measure" he
in the end proclaimed emancipation, without even a
pretense of constitutional authority to do so, and
indeed in direct defiance of the Constitution. But at
least he hesitated to do this, and waited before doing
it until the exigencies of an uncertain war seemed
to force that extreme measure upon him as one of
national self-defense.</p>
<p>At the first he decided as his fixed policy to assert
the authority of the National Government in the seceding
states, to insist upon the enforcement of the

<pb id="VAC0885-172" n="166"/>
                    
laws there, to recover such government property as
those states had seized upon and to use such force as
might be required for these ends. He clearly understood
that there were men by hundreds of thousands
in the North who would stand by him in an endeavor
thus to restore and maintain the Union, but who
would instantly and angrily desert him should he
proclaim a war for the extirpation of slavery within
the states in which that institution constitutionally
existed.</p>
<p>Accordingly he addressed all his endeavors solely
to the task of asserting and maintaining the national
authority in the seceding states.</p>
<p>Had all the Southern states seceded before he assumed
office his problem would have been an easy one.
He would simply have had to call upon the Northern
states for military forces sufficient to carry out this
program of law enforcement. But Virginia had not
seceded, and five other Southern states had submitted
their course to Virginia's decision. Virginia was
anxiously busying herself to find some ground of
reconciliation, some means of accomplishing that
preservation of the Union which Mr. Lincoln had
declared to be his own and only object of endeavor.</p>
<p>But if Mr. Lincoln was to enforce the laws in the
seceding states, and thus to maintain the Union, he
must have troops. The little regular army could not
furnish them. Either the militia must be called out or
volunteers must be summoned for the purpose.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln called upon all the states that had not
yet seceded for their several quotas required to make
up an army of 75,000 men, with which in effect to

<pb id="VAC0885-173" n="167"/>

coerce the seceding states into submission. He demanded
that Virginia should furnish her quota of
troops for this purpose, and Virginia, deeming the
purpose to be an unlawful and iniquitous one, decided
to secede--as she had thitherto resolutely refused
to do--rather than aid in a coercion which all
her Union-loving and peace-loving people regarded
as a wrong, an injustice, an unconstitutional and unlawful
aggression upon the rights of sovereign states.</p>
<p>Virginia seceded unwillingly and not at all because
her people regarded Mr. Lincoln's election as affording
any just ground for the withdrawal of any state
from the Union, but solely because the mother state
was forced to choose between secession on the one
hand and the lending of active assistance on the other
to what all Virginians regarded as a wicked and wanton
warfare by the Federal Government upon sovereign
states for having exercised what all Virginians
held--as most Americans had previously and sometimes
aggressively held--to be their reserved rights
under the Constitution.</p>
<p>It was on the fifteenth day of April, 1861, that Mr.
Lincoln called upon Virginia for her quota of troops
with which to coerce the seceding states into submission.
It was on the sixteenth day of April that Virginia's
constitutional convention, bravely, resolute in
its love for the Union and in its antagonism to the
policy of secession, was confronted with the choice of
furnishing troops to aid in what its members almost
unanimously regarded as a political crime or the alternative
of joining that secession movement from
which the sober and conservative thought of Virginia

<pb id="VAC0885-174" n="168"/>
                    
had so long and so courageously held aloof in defiance
of criticism and in face of contempt and contumely.</p>
<p>To men of high minds, holding these views, there
could be but one choice in such a case. They decreed
that Virginia should prefer a secession which that
state overwhelmingly disapproved, to a dishonor which
no Virginian could contemplate with a satisfied mind.
Accordingly Virginia's strongly pro-Union convention
reluctantly adopted an ordinance of secession,
on the seventeenth day of April, 1861, not of choice
but upon a conviction of necessity. The other border
states that had waited for Virginia's decision to
determine their own, became at once members of
the new Southern Confederacy and the question of
war or peace was finally decided in behalf of war--
war to the limit of possibility, war to the utmost end
of endurance, war to the point of exhaustion on the
one side or the other.</p>
<p>A wise prophet, basing his prophecies upon the
patent facts of the situation, could not have failed to
foretell the outcome of such a war with precision and
certainty. The utmost that the South could do--even
by "robbing the cradle and the grave" as was wittily
and sadly said at the time, was to put 600,000 men
into the field, first and last. The North was able to
enlist an aggregate of 2,778,304, or, if we reduce this
to a basis of three years' service for each man, the
Union enlistments for three full years numbered no
less than 2,326,168--or nearly four times the total
enlistments in the Confederate army from beginning
to end of the war. Yet the Confederate armies included
practically every white man in the South who

<pb id="VAC0885-175" n="169"/>
                    
was able to bear arms. There was in effect a levy <hi rend="i">en
masse</hi>, including the entire white male population
from early boyhood to extreme old age.</p>
<p>Again the Federal Government had a navy and
the Confederates none. It was certain from the beginning
that the Federal authorities would completely
shut the South in by blockading and closely sealing
every southern port. Thus the Federals--as was apparent
in advance--were destined to have the whole
world to draw upon for soldiers, for supplies, for
ammunition, for improved arms and for everything
else that contributes to military strength, while the
South must rely absolutely upon itself--ill armed,
and unequipped with anything except courage, devotion
and heroic fortitude.</p>
<p>There were no facilities at the South for the manufacture
of arms. There was not an armory in all
that land that could turn out a musket of the pattern
then in use, not a machine shop that could convert a
muzzle-loading rifle into a breech-loader or give to
any gun so much as a choke bore. There were foundries
that could cast iron cannon of an antique
pattern, but not one that could make a modern gun.
There were machine shops--a very few--in which the
Northern-made locomotives then in use on Southern
railroads could be repaired in a small way, but there
was not in all the South a shop in which a useful locomotive
could be built. Nor were there any car
builders who had had experience in the making of
rolling stock fit for service.</p>
<p>In brief the South was an agricultural region accustomed
to depend upon the North and upon

<pb id="VAC0885-176" n="170"/>
                    
Europe for its mechanical devices and the outbreak
of war was clearly destined to be the signal for the
shutting off of both Northern and European supplies.
Even in the matter of medicines--and greatly more
soldiers die of disease than of wounds--the South
had no adequate supply and no assured means of
creating one for itself. Quinine, calomel and opium
were scarcely less necessary than gunpowder and
bullets to the conduct of military operations. Yet
there was nowhere in the South a "plant" that
could produce any one of those drugs. Nor was
there anywhere a mercury supply from which calomel
might be made. Early in the war it became impossible
to procure so much as a Seidlitz powder
in the South. There was nowhere a factory that
could make a scalpel, to say nothing of more ingeniously
contrived surgical implements. The materials
for making gunpowder were so wanting that citizens
were urged a little later to dig up the earthen floors
of their smoke-houses and their tobacco barns and
were instructed in the art of extracting the niter
from them. In the towns women were officially solicited
to save their chamber lye and deliver it to
the authorities in order that its chemicals might
be utilized in the creation of explosives. Farmers
were by law forbidden to burn corn cobs in their
fire places and required to turn them over instead
to the authorities in order that their sodas and pot
ashes might be utilized in the manufacture of gunpowder.
Women were urged to grow poppies and
instructed in the art of so scarring the plants as to
secure the precious gum from which opium could

<pb id="VAC0885-177" n="171"/>
                    
be made for the relief of suffering in the hospitals.
They were taught also how to harvest and stew dog-
fennel in order to secure a substitute for quinine.
The negro boys were set at work to dig up the roots
of the dogwood, and women were taught to extract
from the bark of such roots a bitters which served
as a substitute for the unobtainable quinine.</p>
<p>In short, at every point the South was lamentably
lacking in supplies, and the blockade, established
early in the war, forbade the incoming of such things
as were needed except at serious risk of capture and
confiscation.</p>
<p>Even food supplies were from the first to the last
meager. The South produced very little corn, pork,
wheat, and the like, in comparison with the production
of the great northwestern states or in comparison
with the need that was created by the enlistment of all
the able-bodied white men of that region in the Confederate
army.</p>
<p>Thus the South was at a fearful disadvantage from
the first; the wiser men of the South knew the fact
in advance. They had courage and they had little
else. Their achievement in maintaining a strenuous
war for four years in face of such disparities of force
and resources, must always be accounted to their
credit as brave and resourceful men.</p>
<p>It was certain from the first that the South must
be beaten in its struggle--unless by dash and daring
it should win at once, or unless, by some remote
chance, assistance should come from without. The
chance of that was very small but it existed as a factor
in the problem. The chief hope the Southern people

<pb id="VAC0885-178" n="172"/>

had of winning the war upon which they entered with
courage and enthusiasm was born of the delusive
belief that the god of battles awards victory, not to
the strong but to the righteous. They devoutly believed
that their cause was righteous, and, in spite
of all the teachings of history, they expected God to
interpose in some fashion to give them the victory.
They believed themselves to be battling for the same
right of self-government among men that their revolutionary
ancestors had fought for, and they refused
to recognize any disparity of resources between the
contending forces as a sufficient reason for their
failure under the rule of a just God in whose reign
over human affairs they devoutly believed.</p>
<p>They were sentimentalists. They believed that
ideas rather than facts ruled the world and its affairs.
They had been nurtured upon the Bible and Scott's
novels, and they believed in both.</p>
<p>Had any prophet arisen among them who should
have measured their resources against those of their
adversary, they would have refused to listen to his
prophesyings. They would have gone on believing
that they were entirely certain of success and victory
by reason of what seemed to them the indisputable
righteousness of their cause.</p>
<p>There were men among them who rightly recognized
the enormous disparity between the resources
of the North and those that the South could command.
But such men were few and their counsel counted for
nothing.</p>
<p>As for the extremists, they anticipated military
commissions and political preferment for themselves,

<pb id="VAC0885-179" n="173"/>
                    
and they cared for little else than to occupy a conspicuous
place in public attention for a little while. They
were in spirit gamblers, ready to stake everything
upon uncertain chance. They wanted war for the
sake of what war might bring to them of advantage,
and they were ready to stake everything upon the
hazard of their own fortune.</p>
<p>It was in Virginia mainly that there were men of
soberer minds, as had been demonstrated in the Virginians'
choice of men to represent them in their constitutional
convention. But even in Virginia there
were hotheads and fools a plenty, who believed that
a war was to be won by hurrahs, and that enthusiasm
was an effective substitute for ammunition.</p>
<p>The secession of Virginia made the war a fact and
a necessity. So long as that had been delayed there
had remained a hope of reconciliation and adjustment
by peaceful devices. When that event occurred it
was certain that the question at issue must be fought
out upon bloody battlefields.</p>
<p>The final stage of the controversy had been
reached. The case had been appealed to the arbitrament
of steel and gunpowder. Argument was at an
end and brute force had come in as umpire. It was
a melancholy spectacle over which the gods might
well have wept. But men on both sides greeted it
joyously as if it had been a holiday occasion.</p>

<p>The events that brought about the Confederate
War, the conditions and circumstances under which
it occurred, and the passions and prejudices which inspired
that bloody and most lamentable conflict have
been sufficiently and quite truthfully set forth, the
author believes, in the preceding chapters of this work.
He has sought to show them forth without prejudice,
and in a spirit of the utmost candor and fairness.
It is the function of the historian to record facts, not
to complain of them; to describe conditions, not to
criticize them.</p>
<p>After nearly half a century of study it is the firm
conviction of the present historian that the Confederate
war was a necessary and unescapable result of
historic conditions; that nobody in particular was to
blame for it, because there was nobody who could have
prevented or averted it. History and circumstance
had combined to compel its occurrence, and for its 
occurrence no person and no party was in any accountable
way responsible. It occurred because the logic
of circumstance compelled it, and it was fought out
with conscience upon both sides.</p>
<p>Incidentally there were wrongs done in its conduct,
quite as a matter of course. He must be a stupid
reader of history who does not understand that the

<pb id="VAC0885-184" n="178"/>

doing of wrong is inevitable in every great historical
event. But he must also be a very stupid and prejudiced
reader of history who can contemplate the story
of the Confederate war without realizing that on the
one side and on the other conscience was the inspiring
motive of it. He must be dull indeed who fails to
see that devotion had its part to play on both sides
and that on both sides it played it well, to the everlasting
glory of the American name.</p>
<p>The story of the war on the one side, and on the
other, is a story of American heroism in courage and
in endurance, in battle and in camp, in action and
in the patient submission to hardship, in dash and in
defeat, in assault and in retreat. The purpose of the
succeeding chapters is to tell that story without passion
or prejudice, without fear or favor, and with no
flinching from the truth, whithersoever it may lead.</p>
<p>So far as actual fighting was concerned, the war
began with the bombardment of Fort Sumter, in
Charleston Harbor on the morning of April 12, 1861.</p>
<p>When President Lincoln was inaugurated, the
total military force at command of the Government
amounted to a mere handful of men, and these were
mainly occupied with the duty of garrisoning frontier
posts and maintaining the subjection of the
Indians. So far as eastern positions were concerned
there were scarcely enough men in the forts to take
care of the government property there and perform
a perfunctory guard duty.</p>
<p>The total force in Charleston Harbor consisted of
seventy men under command of Major Robert Anderson.
This force occupied Fort Moultrie, at that

<pb id="VAC0885-185" n="179"/>

time an indefensible position by reason of the unfinished
character of its fortifications and the ease of
approach to it from the land side.</p>
<p>As a matter of military prudence and under a
threat of war, Major Anderson decided to transfer
his little force to the far more defensible and, to
Charleston, the far more threatening work, Fort
Sumter. This he did in the early morning of December
26, 1860.</p>
<p>This military transfer of force from an indefensible
to a defensible work, was construed by the Confederates
to be a distinct violation of the agreement which
had been made by the Buchanan administration, to
the general effect that, pending final negotiations,
there should be no change made in the military situation
at any point in the South.</p>
<p>Major Anderson's transfer of his little force from
Fort Moultrie, where it might easily have been captured
from the land side to the sea-girt fortress in
the middle of the harbor, was held to be a violation
of this compact. Without going into the lawyers'
quibbles concerning that question, let us recognize
the situation and relate the events that grew out of it.</p>
<p>The Confederates, under the skilled direction of
General Beauregard, a little later began the construction
of works and the emplacement of guns that
should completely command Fort Sumter. There
was in all this a good deal of the "fuss and feathers"
that plays so large a part in the beginning of every
war made by a people wholly unused to military
operations. With a field battery and one columbiad
or one Dahlgren gun, General Beauregard could

<pb id="VAC0885-186" n="180"/>
                    
easily have reduced Fort Sumter on any one of the
long days of waiting and preparation. Or, with
a single battalion of determined men he could have
taken it by assault in spite of such resistance as its
feeble defending force could have offered. But those
were the days of spectacular effects. The "pomp
and circumstance of glorious war" were necessary
agents in the work of so exciting the southern mind
as to overcome the reluctance of Virginia, North
Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky and Missouri
to join the seceding column. So pomp and circumstance
were freely invoked.</p>
<p>General Beauregard's preparations for the reduction
of a brick fort which must quickly crumble under
an efficient artillery fire, defended as it was by less
than a single company of men, were such as might
have been made for the reduction of some fortress
like that at Gibraltar, or the elaborate works in the
Bermuda Islands.</p>
<p>But it was not the purpose of either side to bring
on the inevitable war as yet. The quibbling lawyers
and phrase-mongering diplomatists were busy at
work in wordy fence, each trying to force upon the
other the technical responsibility of beginning the
war by some act of forcible aggression.</p>
<p>On both sides every nerve was strained to make
military preparations, precisely as if the coming of
war had been recognized as certain--as in fact it
was--while on both sides there was a jealously maintained
pretense of entirely peaceful purposes. The
organization of military forces on either side was
easily explainable and excusable upon the plea of

<pb id="VAC0885-187" n="181"/>
                    
prudence and of a necessary preparation for conceivably
possible emergencies, and on both sides these
preparations for war served to arouse the fighting
instincts of the populace and thus to make war more
and more obviously inevitable.</p>
<p>During the first forty days or so of Mr. Lincoln's
administration there was nothing done that was not
in consonance with the Buchanan program of peace
and waiting. Nothing was undertaken of a more
positive character than the acts of the Buchanan rule.
So far as proclamations and professions and pledges
of peaceful purpose were concerned there was no
change either for better or for worse.</p>
<p>In his inaugural address Mr. Lincoln outlined his
policy by saying of the administration that it aimed
only at the preservation of the Union. He said, "It
will constitutionally maintain and defend itself. In
doing this there need be no bloodshed or violence,
and there shall be none unless it is forced upon the
national authority. The power confided to me will
be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and
places belonging to the Government, and collect the
duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary
for these objects, there will be no invasion, no
using of force against or among people anywhere.
In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen,
and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil
war. The Government will not assail you. You can
have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors."</p>
<p>All this was very specious and to the Northern
mind convincing, but it ignored the fundamental fact


<pb id="VAC0885-188" n="182"/>
                    
that the seceding states claimed a constitutional right
to secede and that having exercised that asserted
right, they denied the right of the United States Government
to "hold, occupy and possess," forts, arsenals
or custom houses within their territory, or within that
territory to "collect duties and imposts." The very
vitals of the question at issue were involved in that
assumption of right on the part of the Federal Government
to impose and enforce laws and imposts, and
to assert and maintain rights of property possession
within the territories of states that had, as they resolutely
contended, taken themselves out of the Union
by rigidly constitutional methods.</p>
<p>It is not purposed here idly and uselessly to discuss
this constitutional question. It is only intended to
show how it presented itself to the minds of men on
the one side and upon the other. To the Northern
mind, which had forgotten its own pleas for disunion
and its own claims of the right of any state to secede,
Mr. Lincoln's declared purpose seemed an altogether
righteous and reasonable proposal of governmental
activity and necessary national self-assertion. To
the Southern mind, in which the traditional doctrine
survived of the right of any state to secede at will, it
seemed a proposal of intolerable aggression.</p>
<p>If the seceding states had acted within their constitutional
right in seceding, then they were no longer
within the dominion or in any remotest way subject
to the jurisdiction of the United States. Any attempt
on the part of that government to exercise
jurisdiction or to "collect duties and imposts" within
their borders was a trespass upon their independence,

<pb id="VAC0885-189" n="183"/>
                    
an affront to their dignity, an invasion of their sovereignty,
in brief an act of direct war upon them.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln's inaugural address, as the Southerners
held, begged the whole question at issue. It
assumed that secession was an unconstitutional nullity
and that the seceding states were still in the Union
and still subject to its laws, its imposts and its duties.
That was the whole matter in dispute. If that
assumption was correct then it was permitted to him
to use any force he might see fit to employ with which
to compel them to obedience. But if the assumption
was incorrect--if those seceding states had in fact
constitutionally withdrawn from the Union, as they
contended that they had done--then he had no more
right to exercise authority, to enforce laws, to possess
"places and property" or to "collect duties and imposts"
within their boundaries than he had to do the
same within the domains of Britain, France or Germany.
This was the very marrow of the question at
issue.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln's words spoken in his inaugural
address were meant to be placative to Southern sentiment
and to minister to that reconciliation which
from beginning to end was the sincerest desire of his
soul. But they were based upon a seemingly total
misconception. They constituted a refusal to recognize
what the South held to be a fundamental fact.
Mr. Lincoln's placative words did not placate for the
reason that they completely ignored the Southern
contention. They became instead, directly offensive
as an assertion of the wrongfulness of secession, and
its utter lack of constitutional authority.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-190" n="184"/>
                    
<p>His words, the men of the South thought, claimed
either too much or greatly too little.</p>
<p>All this was only a part and a small part of the
fencing by which the men in high place on either side
sought in that troubled time to shift, each to the others'
shoulders, responsibility for the actual and brutal
beginning of a war which was clearly inevitable, and
the occurrence of which had been made steadily more
and more a necessity by the events of history during
generations past.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile both sides were making every
possible preparation for a war that had not been
declared, a war that both professed to regard as
unnecessary, a war for the outbreak of which each
was determined that the other and not itself should
bear all the blame.</p>
<p>The Congress at Washington had adjourned at the
beginning of March without making any warlike
appropriations whatsoever. Forty days of Mr.
Lincoln's administration had passed without the calling
of a regiment or a company or even a soldier into
the field. Congress had indeed passed a resolution
declaring its purpose to avoid war and its conviction
that every possible concession should be made by
Northern sentiment in avoidance of that terrible
catastrophe.</p>
<p>It had resolved:</p>
<p>"That the existing discontents among the Southern
people, and the growing hostility to the Federal Government
among them, are greatly to be regretted; and
that whether such discontents and hostility are without
just cause or not, any reasonable proper and

<pb id="VAC0885-191" n="185"/>
                    
constitutional remedies and additional and more
specific guarantees of their peculiar rights and interests,
as recognized by the Constitution, necessary to
preserve the peace of the country and the perpetuity
of the Union, should be promptly and cheerfully
granted."</p>
<p>But how much did this resolution signify? It was
passed by more than a two-thirds majority of a rump
House of Representatives after the Southern members
of that body had withdrawn from it. It therefore
seemed to represent Northern and Republican
sentiment. But the Senate rejected it and it came to
nothing. It was a resolve that concessions should be
made and that new guarantees should be given in the
interest of the Union's preservation. But, the Southerners
pointed out, the concessions were not made
and the new guarantees were not given.</p>
<p>It was impossible, in fact, that these things should
be done. It was easy for Congress to resolve that
"any reasonable, proper and constitutional remedies
and additional and more specific guarantees" should
be given, but quite another thing to secure the execution
of such a program. One house of Congress
vetoed the action of the other on every such resolution
and both refused to put the guarantees into legal
form. Northern sentiment saw and resented in every
such proposition a suggestion of still further concession
to that slave power which Northern sentiment
had come to abhor with all the loathing that is possible
to the human mind, and Northern sentiment would
have no part or lot in concession to a system which
under compulsion of the Constitution it might tolerate

<pb id="VAC0885-192" n="186"/>

but to the perpetuation of which it would on no
account lend a hand.</p>
<p>On the other side the extremists of the South asked
for no further guarantees and trusted none that
might be offered. They contended that the guarantees
of the Constitution itself had been nullified by
the laws of the Northern States; that every compromise
had been broken; that, as they insisted, Northern
sentiment had openly and distinctly approved of
servile insurrection, with all the horror that it must
imply, as a means of abolishing slavery; and that
there was no further hope of reconciliation by virtue
of paper guarantees which the Federal Government
had no adequate power to enforce.</p>
<p>The issue had, in fact, been made up and all
attempts at compromise were futile folly. The war
to which the country's history and politics for half a
century past had been leading had at last come and
the only real question that remained to be settled was
that of who should begin the actual fighting. That
detail was of no real importance.</p>
<p>The South bore its part in all this by-play and
coquetry of endeavors at reconciliation. It sent distinguished
men as delegates to plead for peace at
Washington, either, as some of them urged, upon
some basis of compromise or, as others insisted, upon
a governmental recognition of secession as a right
and a fact, the recognition of which would indeed
have furnished a peaceful remedy for ills otherwise
irremediable, an easy and peaceful way out of a
controversy that otherwise threatened a savage,
brutal and peculiarly devastating war. But that

<pb id="VAC0885-193" n="187"/>

remedy was obviously and absurdly impossible of
adoption in the circumstances then existing.</p>
<p>Neither side was in the least degree disposed to
accept or even seriously to consider the peace proposals
of the other. Neither being willing to yield a
single item of its contention, there was no ground or
chance of compromise. It was clearly understood
upon both sides that war was presently to come.</p>
<p>On both sides there was an active sharpening of
swords and a diligent rubbing up of guns that might
prove serviceable in war.</p>
<p>At the South practically all the able-bodied young
men were enlisted in what were then called "volunteer
companies," though it did not yet appear in what
cause they were supposed to be volunteering. They
were drilled and disciplined and made into something
at least remotely resembling soldiers. Their familiarity
with firearms and their habits of strenuous
outdoor life fitted them for comparatively easy transformation
into troops.</p>
<p>At the North there was an equally active preparation
for war. Among other warlike initiatives a
fleet was preparing for the relief of Fort Sumter or
at the least for a threatening manifestation off
Charleston harbor. It had every equipment--even to
surf boats for use in enforced landings--that such a
fleet could require, and it presently sailed. Neither
mail nor telegraphic communication between the
North and the South had as yet been interfered with,
and so every detail of preparation made upon either
side was instantly reported to the other.</p>
<p>These were the conditions in which the actual

<pb id="VAC0885-194" n="188"/>
                    
struggle approached. When on the night after
Christmas Major Anderson transferred his little
handful of men under cover of darkness from the
hopelessly indefensible works of Fort Moultrie to the
seemingly much stronger position at Fort Sumter,
the Confederates clamorously contended that the
change was a violation of the Buchanan administration's
promise to maintain the military status quo.
They seized upon the occurrence as an excuse for
that erection of batteries around the harbor which has
already been spoken of. In the meanwhile they
courteously extended the hospitalities of the city of
Charleston to Major Anderson, freely permitting
him to send men ashore and to supply himself in the
Charleston markets with fresh vegetables, butter,
eggs, milk and whatever else he needed for the comfort
of his command.</p>
<p>But when an attempt was made during the
Buchanan administration to provision Fort Sumter
for a siege, the steamer <hi rend="i">Star of the West,</hi> which
carried the supplies, was forbidden to approach the
fort and compelled to put again to sea.</p>
<p>Then followed negotiations which were marked by
all that suave and gentle courtesy which characterizes
the preliminary communications between duelists
who intend presently to shoot one another.</p>                   
<p>The state of South Carolina, claiming to be an
independent sovereignty and a member of a new and
sovereign confederacy, courteously asked the United
States Government to withdraw its military force
from Charleston Harbor. The state represented that

<pb id="VAC0885-195" n="189"/>
                    
the military occupation of a fortress within its domain
by another sovereign power was derogatory to
the dignity and independence of the state. It courteously
offered adequate compensation to the United
States for any property that might be involved in the
change but politely insisted that the United States
Government should cease to trespass upon the dignity
of a sister nation.</p>
<p>To all this the Buchanan administration with equal
courtesy replied, declining to recognize in South
Carolina the status it claimed as an independent
state, but seemingly at least promising the early
evacuation of Fort Sumter.</p>
<p>All this was "play for position" on both sides and
it produced the desired effect. It put South Carolina
and the seceding states "right upon the record."
That is to say, it enabled them to avoid even the
appearance of recognizing the existence of Federal
authority within their borders and on the other hand
it gave to the more or less friendly administration of
Mr. Buchanan the opportunity it desired to finish its
term without armed conflict and without the necessity
of assuming any positive and pronounced attitude
toward secession.</p>
<p>But even after Mr. Lincoln came into office the
clash of arms was postponed. Neither side was as
yet ready for it, and each earnestly desired to throw
upon the other the responsibility of precipitating a
conflict which was clearly inevitable and for which
each must account as best it could to that "opinion
of mankind" to which the American Declaration of


<pb id="VAC0885-196" n="190"/>
                    
Independence had been reverently addressed as an
act of "decent respect."</p>
<p>So for forty days or so after Mr. Lincoln assumed
office there was nothing done, except in the way of
preparation for emergencies. In the meanwhile Virginia
still held aloof from the secession movement
and five other border states--the chief sources of that
military strength which resides in a food supply--
were waiting for the word from the mother state.</p>
<p>It began to be understood in South Carolina that
something must be done to compel Virginia to take
her stand one way or the other. There was little if
any doubt that upon the abstract right of any state
to secede, Virginia stood firmly with the South. But
her protest was resolute against the contention that
secession was at that time either necessary or politic.
It was necessary, therefore, to "force Virginia's
hand," as whist players say, to do something which
might leave to that state no choice but that between
secession on her own part and consent, on the other
hand, to the doctrine that the National Government
was possessed of a right to coerce, and by military
force to subdue, states that had assumed to act upon
what they claimed to be and what Virginia freely
recognized as the right of .each state to withdraw
from the Union at its own good pleasure. It was
plain that the war must be hurried into being if the
new Confederacy, composed exclusively of the cotton
states, was to ally Virginia and the other food-producing
states of the South with itself and thus secure
any hope or even any chance of success in its effort
to maintain itself.</p>
                    
<pb id="VAC0885-197" n="191"/>

<p>Accordingly General Beauregard, who was in command
at Charleston, was ordered to demand the surrender
of Fort Sumter, and upon refusal to reduce
that work. This was a ridiculously easy task. But
its execution was a thing of momentous consequence.</p>
<p>Major Anderson, who commanded the fort with
its mere handful of men, was himself a man of Southern
extraction, as were Farragut, George H. Thomas,
Winfield Scott and even Lincoln himself. But
Anderson was a soldier in the United States Army
and while he freely declared that his heart was not
in a war against the South, he had no thought of
failing in his soldierly duty.</p>
<p>When on the eleventh of April, 1861, he was summoned
to surrender, he refused, as it became a brave
officer to do. He knew perfectly well that Beauregard
had force enough and cannon enough and ammunition
enough to reduce a dozen such forts as that
which he commanded, but in that spirit which
throughout the war animated every good soldier of
whatever rank in both armies, he refused to yield until
such time as physical force should overcome his
powers of resistance and compel his surrender.
There was a relieving fleet in the offing, but, though
it drew near enough during the action for Major
Anderson to salute it, it rendered him no assistance
and indeed made no attempt to do so.</p>
<p>Beauregard opened fire upon the fort at 4:20 A.M.
on the twelfth of April, from batteries located at
every available range point. The unfitness of the
antiquated masonry work to endure a bombardment
was quickly and, to Major Anderson, disastrously

<pb id="VAC0885-198" n="192"/>
                    
demonstrated, but in spite of all he heroically held
out until on the next day his men were literally driven
from their guns by the smoke of the burning quarters
within the fortification. Unable to make further
resistance and obviously hopeless of assistance even
from that fleet in the offing which had been elaborately
equipped and sent to effect his reinforcement
and rescue, he at last capitulated.</p>
<p>He was permitted to salute his flag before lowering
it, to march his command out of the fort with military
honors, and to sail North with his men.</p>
<p>Those were the mild-mannered, courteous, drawing-
room days of war. The butchery and brutality
were to come later. Nobody had been killed by the
fire of either side, and nobody wounded. The courtesy
which had marked all relations between Major
Anderson and the Carolinians was maintained to the
end. Major Anderson left Charleston as any honored
guest might have left a hospitable mansion in
Charleston Neck after entertainment, with the good
wishes, the friendship, and the godspeed of his hosts.
Nothing could have been pleasanter or more exquisitely
courteous than this encounter and this parting.
But it was the preface to a war which sent brave men
by scores of thousands to their graves, desolated
thousands of homes, North and South, made widows
of loving wives and orphans of unoffending children.</p>
<p>So far as the direct effect of the spectacular but
bloodless bombardment of Fort Sumter was concerned
it failed of its purpose. Even such an event
did not prompt the Virginia convention, as had been
hoped and confidently anticipated, to adopt an ordinance

<pb id="VAC0885-199" n="193"/>

of secession. On the day after news of it was
received in Richmond the representatives of the
mother state stood as resolutely as ever in opposition
to a secession program, which they deemed at once
impolitic and unjustified by anything in the situation
of affairs.</p>
<p>But the bombardment accomplished its intended
effect by indirection. It gave Mr. Lincoln occasion
to call for a volunteer army with which to meet what
had thus assumed the character of a war upon the
United States. As has been already related he called
for seventy-five thousand men and demanded of Virginia
that she should furnish her proportional part of
that force. After many weeks of resolute resistance
to what the Virginians regarded as a policy of
quixotic folly and certain destruction, the Virginia
convention on the seventeenth of April, 1861, adopted
an ordinance of secession. From that hour war was
on in earnest, as both sides quite clearly understood.</p>

<p>With the secession of Virginia on the seventeenth
of April, 1861, there came a final end to all hope of
finding a way out. The active border states did not
immediately declare their secession indeed, but that
was a foregone conclusion so far as Arkansas, North
Carolina and Tennessee were concerned, and military
proceedings did not wait for the formal act. That
came on the sixth of May, in Arkansas, on the twentieth
of May in North Carolina, and on the eighth of
June in Tennessee. Kentucky and Missouri were so
divided in sentiment that no united action for or
against the Union could be secured.</p>
<p>Kentucky officially assumed an attitude of neutrality
to which neither side paid the smallest attention
then or later. That indeed was the most
impossible of all conceivable attitudes. It assumed
to the state all the independent right of action that
secession itself implied, without asserting a claim to
the right of secession. It proclaimed Kentucky to be
so far out of the Union as to demand respect for its
neutrality and so far in the Union as to exercise its
full voice in Congress. It warned the armies of both
sides to avoid trespass upon Kentucky's territory,
a warning which, if Kentucky had undertaken to enforce,
it would have involved that state in immediate

<pb id="VAC0885-201" n="195"/>

war with both the combatants at one and the same
time. The thing was ridiculous from the beginning,
absurd in conception and a ludicrous failure in execution.
There was later a pretense of secession by a
so-called convention in that state, but it was not
taken seriously on either side, and in the end the state
furnished volunteers to both the contending armies
in substantially equal numbers.</p>
<p>Tennessee did much the same thing but in a different
fashion. That state's adoption of an ordinance
of secession was quite regular in form. It had all the
validity that the like ordinance adopted by any other
state had or could have. But it did not and could not
command the obedience of Tennessee's people in anything
like the degree in which secession ordinances in
other states had commanded the obedience of the people
of those states. The advocates of secession had
secured a majority vote in Tennessee, but it was not
a very pronounced majority. Still more important,
the division of sentiment there was mainly geographical.
In the mountainous eastern part of the
state and in the adjacent mountains of North Carolina
where slavery scarcely at all existed and where
little mountain farms and hunters' log cabins stood
in the place of plantations and stately mansions, the
sentiment was overwhelmingly in favor of the Union.
This was perhaps scarcely more largely due to a feeling
of loyalty to the Union, though that was strong,
than to a still more active sentiment of hostility and
antagonism to the wealth and social pretensions of
the cotton and tobacco planters whose more fruitful
fields lay farther to the west.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-202" n="196"/>
                    
<p>The often illiterate but shrewdly intelligent mountaineers,
to whom education had offered few and very
meager advantages and with whom fortune had dealt
rather harshly, were very naturally jealous of their
better educated, better fed, and altogether more prosperous
neighbors. It is hard for the man who
trudges afoot or rides astride an underfed mule for
which his forage supply is scant, to entertain kindly
feelings toward the man who goes about in his carriage
drawn by sleek and negro-groomed horses. It
is not easy for the man who houses his family in a
mud-daubed log hut and feeds his half-clad wife and
children upon corn pone and an often uncertain ration
of bacon or salt pork, to avoid sentiments of discontent
when he realizes how much easier and more
luxurious is the lot of those who "wear purple and
fine linen and fare sumptuously every day."</p>
<p>So, in the mountain regions of Tennessee, among
the stalwart six-footers who were inured to hardship,
and who knew all there was to know about using a
rifle with effect, there was a very general impulse to
join the Union armies and fight against the slave-
holding class, whom   they regarded as hereditary
enemies.</p>
<p>In the region a little farther west this class antagonism
was intensified by a closer contact and one
often more exasperating. Between these two classes
there was instinctive and implacable war already; and
when the time came for the poorer Tennesseans to
choose on which side they would fight, they very generally
elected to fight against and not for an institution
which they believed to be the source and origin


<pb id="VAC0885-203" n="197"/>
                    
and ultimate cause of that social inferiority which so
galled and irritated and angered them.</p>
<p>Let us not misunderstand. These people had no
theories on the subject of slavery. The few of them
who could in any wise come into the ownership of a
negro held to that property possession as resolutely
as they would have held to the ownership of a mule
or an ox. They were not troubled by any scruples of
conscience concerning the ownership of human beings
or beset in their minds by any abstractions as to human
rights. They no more regarded the negro as the
equal of the white man than did their plantation
owning neighbors. A negro was in their eyes a
"nigger," to be worked to his utmost capacity and
mercilessly lashed when guilty of any insolence.
They were even less ready than their wealthier neighbors
to tolerate any assumption of equality on the
part of a negro. They were quicker even than the
planters to see and resent such assumptions because
their own social status as the superiors of black men
was less marked and less secure than that of the
planters. A very small concession on that point
would have obliterated the only social distinction that
these poor cabin dwellers enjoyed.<ref id="ref_003" rend="super" target="note_003">1</ref></p>
<p>But these mountain dwellers--these children of
poverty and hardship--saw no reason why they should
fight for a system which they resented with every

<note id="note_003"><ref target="ref_003" rend="super">1</ref> The author had occasion closely to note a like attitude of mind on the
part of the cabin dwellers of the Virginia mountains, with whom he was
brought into close and constant contact during the war. No rich planter in
all the land could have been more insistent than they were upon the social
distinction between a white man and a negro or readier than they to resent
negro assumption.</note>

<pb id="VAC0885-204" n="198"/>
                    
impulse of their minds; a system which somehow--
they could not reason out how--created the disparity
of fortune and social status and personal comfort
which existed between themselves and their plantation-
owning neighbors.</p>
<p>In Missouri the situation was different. There
too the population was divided in sentiment but not
upon strictly geographical lines, in any pronounced
way at least. In Missouri more than anywhere else,
the war took on the character of a true civil war.
There was a pretense of secession there also, but it
represented only a part of the population and amounted
only to a declaration in favor of the South by what
may or may not have been a majority of the people.
It led instantly to war, but it did not distinctly place
Missouri either in the list of seceding states or in that
of states that adhered to the Union.</p>
<p>Thus the issue was made up. Eleven states,
namely, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas,
Arkansas, Tennessee and Florida, had formally seceded.
Kentucky had absurdly and futilely declared
an impossible neutrality, Missouri had entered upon
a program of civil war within her own borders. Maryland
adhered to the Union but sent the flower of her
young manhood into the rival camps with an almost
equal hand. Delaware, though nominally a slave
state, was so situated as to be out of the reckoning of
secession. The rest of the states adhered to the Union
and were prepared to support its cause with unnumbered
men and unstinted means.</p>
<p>It is true nevertheless that in most of the Northern


<pb id="VAC0885-205" n="199"/>

States there was a strongly hostile and pro-Southern
sentiment that must be reckoned with, and in New
York and some other states the reckoning was a difficult
one, but in no state did that sentiment at any
time during the war so far secure control of affairs as
to produce disastrous results to the Federal arms or
cause.</p>
<p>Yet how dangerously and threateningly strong
that sentiment was, is easily illustrated by statistics.
In the presidential election of November, 1864, after
the war had been in active and very bloody progress
for more than three years and a half, and after the
power of the Confederates to resist had been enormously
reduced by battle, by blockade and by the
wearing lapse of time, there was a comparatively
narrow majority of votes cast in the Northern States
in behalf of the Union cause.</p>
<p>McClellan was the Democratic candidate for
president. He was running upon a platform the
dominant note of which was a declaration that the
war for the restoration of the Union had proved itself
a failure and should be brought to an end. This could
mean only that the United States Government should
recognize the Confederate Government as a separate,
independent and equal power, and make peace with
it on such terms as could be secured. There is no
other construction possible that would be accepted
anywhere outside the pages of <hi rend="i">Alice in Wonderland</hi>.
It was a distinct and definite proposal that the United
States Government should give up all its contentions,
withdraw its armies from the South, raise its blockade,
admit that its efforts had failed, recognize the independent

<pb id="VAC0885-206" n="200"/>
                    
sovereignty of the Confederate States, and
make the best peace it could with that Republic as a
conquering power. Yet so strong was the anti-war
sentiment at the North that, with only the people of
the Northern States voting, the Democratic candidate
received no less than 1,808,795 votes against 2,216,067
for his adversary. In other words the proposal to
abandon the struggle, recognize Confederate independence
and acknowledge the United States beaten
after three and a half years of strenuous, costly and
very bloody war, was defeated by only 407,349 votes
in the Northern States, in a total vote in those states
of no less than 4,024,865.</p>
<p>This is a fact of the utmost historical significance
which may perhaps be better appreciated if put in
another form. This was an election in which only the
Northern States participated. The Union cause was
supported by all of Mr. Lincoln's personal popularity;
by all the influence of an administration in
possession and with the whole patronage of the Government
at its disposal; by all the sentiment of the
army and the fathers and brothers of the men in the
army; by every influence in short--personal, political
and patriotic--that could be brought to bear. Yet
the declaration that the war for the Union was a
failure and the proposal to abandon all that had been
fought for, was defeated by a majority of scarcely
more than ten per cent. of the total vote cast in the
states that remained professedly loyal to the Union
cause.</p>
<p>The interpretation of this fact is unescapable. It
means that from beginning to end of the war the


<pb id="VAC0885-207" n="201"/>

Federal Government had not one but two enemies to
fight--the Confederacy with its splendidly robust and
enterprising armies, in the front, and the hostility of
very nearly one-half the population of the Northern
States as an enemy in the rear.</p>
<p>In estimating the comparative resources and the
relative opportunities of the contending forces it is
only fair that the student of history should reckon this
as some offset to the fact that the North enlisted
2,700,000 soldiers against the South's 600,000; that it
had a navy with which to shut the South off from the
outer world while itself drawing freely upon every
land for supplies and men and money; and that its
resources in the matters of food, machinery, arms,
equipments, medicines and all sanitary supplies and
equipments were immeasurably superior to those of
the South. How far the one fact really offsets the
other is a matter of which each reader must judge for
himself. But it is a fact worthy of observation that if
the Southern States had been permitted to participate
in that election of 1864 there would have been a
stupendously overwhelming majority of the people
in behalf of the proposition that the war had been a
failure and in favor of the proposal to end it by the
recognition of Confederate independence. Of course
the Confederates, in the attitude they had deliberately
chosen to assume, were in no remotest way entitled to
cast their votes in that election--nor did they think
of claiming that privilege--but the arithmetical calculation
serves to show how easily the conservatives
of the two sections might have controlled the situation
and saved the country from a devastating war

<pb id="VAC0885-208" n="202"/>
                    
had they resolutely acted together at the beginning
against the intemperate radicals on both sides, the
self-regardful politicians and the seekers after
shoulder straps and gold-laced uniforms. It serves
also to show something of the difficulties with which
those were beset who had charge of the Union cause.</p>
<p>These things are perhaps tedious to the reader.
But their just consideration is absolutely necessary
to any really impartial inquiry into the history of the
war, such as this work is intended to be.</p>

<p>The moment Virginia adopted an ordinance of
secession the authorities on both sides recognized the
fact that that state was destined to be the chief battle
ground of the war, and especially that the first and
perhaps the decisive actions of the struggle were
likely to occur there. Accordingly both sides began
at once to hurry troops to that borderland--the South
sending them to such vantage points in Virginia as
might most seriously threaten Washington, the North
sending them to the capital city for its defense and
for that march upon Richmond which, it was hoped
at the North, might be quickly decisive of the war in
favor of the Federal arms.</p>
<p>The Confederate General Forrest is reported to
have defined "strategy" as the art of "getting there
first with the most men." This was what each  side at
that time was endeavoring to do.</p>
<p>Richmond was not yet selected as the Confederate
capital, but its choice as such was already fore-
shadowed as a necessary requirement alike of geography
and politics, and within a brief while the foreshadowing
became a fact. In the meanwhile it was
accepted in advance as a certainty, and the two capitals
confronted each other at a distance of scarcely
more than a hundred miles, as the crow flies.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-210" n="204"/>
                    
<p>The Southern States poured troops into Richmond
as rapidly as they could. The Northern States
poured troops into Washington for the defense of
that capital with all possible energy and enterprise.
Neither upon the one side nor upon the other were
the men soldiers in any proper acceptation of the
term. They were raw levies. From the North they
were mainly men who had passed their young lives
in commerce, in study or in other peaceful pursuits.
From the South they were mainly the sons of planters
or the sons of overseers, accustomed in either
case from their youth up to the use of gunpowder,
and to the employment of those arms in the use of
which gunpowder is a prime factor. The Southern
youths were accustomed to outdoor life, to camp fare,
to self-dependence, to self-sacrifice, if need be. The
Northern youth in the main were accustomed to
nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>Thus at the beginning the Southern troops had an
advantage. This was peculiarly obvious when the
cavalry of the two sections met each other in battle.
The Southern horsemen had been "rough riders"
from infancy. Many of the Northern men of that
arm of the service had never ridden at all except perhaps
by way of conducting a gentle and docile farm
horse to a watering trough. In the matter of horses,
too, the Southerners, and especially the Virginians,
had a distinct advantage. Ever since the first settlement
of Virginia it had been the custom of men in
that nearly roadless state to go everywhere upon
horseback. They had consequently given special attention
to the breeding of horses fit for strenuous


<pb id="VAC0885-211" n="205"/>

work under the saddle, while in the North horse-breeding
had been conducted mainly with a view to harness
use. The wiry Virginian thoroughbreds, or half-
breds, were far fitter for cavalry service, far more
enduring, far quicker of action, far more alert and
responsive than the Conestogas or Percherons or
handsome and fast trotting Morgans of Pennsylvania,
from which state came the first cavalry regiments
encountered by Stuart and his born and bred
cavaliers, mounted as they were upon "Red Eye"
colts or "Revenue" fillies.</p>
<p>The Southern troops also had the advantage of
fighting defensively in their own country to whose
climate they were inured and to the diseases of which
they were in the main immune.</p>                  
<p>But apart from these small differences the two
armies that confronted each other on the Potomac
were composed of substantially the same materials.
Later in the war the large enlistment of immigrants
gave to the Union army an element that did not at
any time exist in the armies of the South. But at
the outset there was no important difference. Each
army was made up of American youths, full of
patriotic fervor, brave, heroic upon occasion, but
utterly untrained in the profession of arms.</p>
<p>On the Northern side in the early contests of the
war there was the advantage of small bodies of regulars,
trained to obey orders at all hazards and to
stand firm in every moment of danger. These regulars
proved themselves of inestimable value in the
early actions of the war; but their numbers were so
small that their service scarcely counts in the historical
reckoning.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-212" n="206"/>
                    
<p>For the rest, both armies were made up of volunteers,
men wholly unused to military discipline and
wholly untrained in that subjection of their own
minds and wills to superior authority which constitutes
the distinction between the soldier and the raw
recruit--between an army and an armed mob. They
were brave fellows, all of them. They were devoted
to the causes they severally served, but they were not
yet soldiers. They retained the unsoldierly habit of
thinking and judging for themselves, where they
should instead have let their officers think and judge
for them. Under the discipline of service and of
fighting they presently reduced themselves to the
ranks, as it were, and became soldiers equal and even
superior to the best regulars that any army on earth
has ever brought into the field. Their deeds at Cold
Harbor, at Fredericksburg, at Chancellorsville, in
the Wilderness, at Petersburg, at Antietam, at
Gettysburg, and on a score of other desperately contested
battlefields leave no possible room for doubt
that the men who composed the Federal and Confederate
armies were the peers and even the superiors
of any other men who ever fought anywhere. But
at the first they were not such. They were undisciplined
and subject to such panics as that sort of
individual thinking in which they indulged is inevitably
bound to produce. It is important to bear these
facts in mind if we would read the early history of the
war understandingly.</p>
<p>The first blood shed in the war, however, was not
shed in formal military action. On the nineteenth
of April, two days after Virginia's secession, a Baltimore


<pb id="VAC0885-213" n="207"/>
                    
more mob assailed a Massachusetts regiment on its
passage through the Maryland city to Washington,
and several persons were killed in the melee. It is
not historically recorded that any of the men who
constituted the mob and made the assault ever afterwards
served in the Confederate army. On the contrary
there is every reason to believe that these men,
so ready for mob violence, very carefully avoided a
service in which legitimate fighting was to be the
daily routine of life. That, however, is a detail--
illustrative, perhaps, but not otherwise important to
history.</p>
<p>The secession of Virginia carried with it one event
of vital and even of supreme importance, namely, the
secession of Robert E. Lee, without whose genius
the Confederate War would almost certainly have
ended in McClellan's capture of Richmond in the
summer of 1862.</p>
<p>General Winfield Scott had called Lee "the flower
of the American Army." He had earnestly recommended
Lee as his own fittest successor in supreme
command of the United States Army and such command
had been definitely offered to Lee. The secession
of half a dozen Northern or border states could
not have been of greater consequence either to the
North or to the South than the decision of Robert E.
Lee to resign his commission and go with his native
state Virginia into a war of secession for which he
saw no occasion or justification. His problem, like
that of Farragut and George H. Thomas and other
officers of Southern birth in the United States Army
and Navy, was a very perplexing one, involving a

<pb id="VAC0885-214" n="208"/>
                    
divided duty such as few men are ever called upon to
confront in the course of their lives. He himself set
forth the considerations that finally determined his
course, in a letter to his sister, the wife of a Union
officer, which it is proper to quote here in explanation.
To this sister he wrote on the twentieth of April,
1861: "We are now in a state of war which will yield
to nothing. The whole South is in a state of revolution,
into which Virginia after a long struggle has
been drawn, and though I recognize no necessity for
this state of things, and would have foreborne and
pleaded to the end for the redress of grievances real
or supposed, yet in my own person I had to meet the
question whether I should take part against my native
state. With all my devotion to the Union and the
feeling of loyalty and duty of an American citizen,
I have not been able to make up my mind to raise
my hand against my relatives, my children, my
home. I have therefore resigned my commission in
the army, and, save in defense of my native state,
with the sincere hope that my poor services may never
be needed, I hope I may never be called upon to draw
my sword."</p>
<p>Surely no more tragic, no more pathetic letter than
that was ever written. Yet it represented and reflected
the struggle which at that time was going on
in the soul of every army or navy officer of Southern
birth and kindred. It was a part of the tragedy
of a war which divided families and set brother
against brother in a strife that knew neither mercy
nor relenting for four, long, terrible years.</p>
<p>Lee went at once to Richmond and was promptly

<pb id="VAC0885-215" n="209"/>
                    
appointed to the task of organizing first the Virginian
and afterwards all the Southern armies for
effective service. For such work of organization he
had a peculiar genius which General Scott recognized,
at the same time congratulating the Union cause
upon the fact that it had some weeks the start of Lee
in the task of creating an army out of untrained and
undisciplined volunteers.</p>
<p>Lee was not yet placed in any active military command,
but at every step he was the supreme military
adviser of the Southern authorities. When Beauregard,
with all the laurels of popular praise upon him,
reached Richmond he and not Lee was the idol of the
hour. His spectacular and rather theatrical reduction
of Fort Sumter had advertised him to the popular
attention as nothing had advertised Lee. But
Lee was his superior in rank as in genius and every
thing else, and it was he who directed Beauregard to
establish himself at Manassas and along Bull Run as
the fittest vantage ground from which to repel the
first serious advance of the Federal Army which was
then assembling at Washington.</p>
<p>At that period of the war there prevailed at Washington
what a military wit and critic afterwards
called "the pepper box policy." That is to say, the
policy was to send forces into all quarters at once, to
defend large and small positions equally, and thus to
scatter an army which if concentrated upon a single
point might have achieved decisive results. Thus if
the whole force available for eastern service had been
brought at once to Washington and pushed thence
toward Richmond it seemingly might have enveloped

<pb id="VAC0885-216" n="210"/>

its adversary in superior numbers, and except for the
uncertainty due to the untrained character of its men
it might have been reckoned upon to achieve decisive
results.</p>
<p>But under the "pepper box policy," a part of this
force was sent under McClellan to West Virginia; a
part of it to the Valley of Virginia under Patterson;
a part of it to Fortress Monroe, and the main body to
Washington and its neighborhood, to protect the
capital and presently to advance for the overthrow
of Beauregard at Manassas and for a determined
advance upon Richmond.</p>
<p>This policy invited defeat and met it. On the
tenth of June the small force at Fortress Monroe
advanced and assailed the Confederates at Big
Bethel. It was defeated with some loss, having
inflicted no corresponding or compensatory injury
upon the Confederates. Even had the expedition
succeeded in driving the Confederates from Big
Bethel, it could not possibly have accomplished anything
of value to the Federal arms or cause. It was
supported by no force at Fortress Monroe or elsewhere
which was conceivably adequate to undertake
an advance by that route upon Richmond. In default
of such support the expedition was a foolish
and futile one, and it must have been so reckoned
even if it had succeeded in capturing the wholly unimportant
works at Big Bethel.</p>
<p>In the same way, early in July, McClellan gained
some notable advantages at Rich Mountain and elsewhere
in West Virginia. He had distinctly the best
of it in the fighting; he dislodged his adversaries from

<pb id="VAC0885-217" n="211"/>

their chosen positions; and he made prisoners of a
considerable number of men. But his expedition led
nowhither. His position and the positions which he
captured from the Confederates were alike strategically
unimportant from the point of view of an
aggressive campaign. His victories commanded no
strategic points and opened no road to any desirable
objective.</p>
<p>In the Valley of Virginia the Confederates abandoned
Harper's Ferry--carrying off everything
there that had military value, and General Patterson
occupied the place. This made good dispatches for
the newspapers and justified startling headlines of
victory. But in very truth it meant nothing whatever
except that the wily Fabian, Joseph E. Johnston, in
command of the Confederate forces in that quarter,
was wisely determined to keep himself and his army
within reinforcing distance of Beauregard at Manassas,
where the first great battle of the war was
obviously destined to occur. Harper's Ferry and
Martinsburg were clearly of no value whatsoever to
General Johnston. By abandoning them and retiring
to Winchester he placed his army twenty-five or thirty
miles nearer to Manassas than it had been and drew
Patterson by so much farther from the fighting
points. For in order to reach and reinforce McDowell
for the impending Manassas fight Patterson
must march north, recross the Potomac, move thence
eastward to Washington and then move southwest
again to McDowell's assistance. Johnston meanwhile
secured to himself a short line of march which
gave him a very great advantage.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-218" n="212"/>

<p>When the time came for the first great battle of
the war to be fought, it was hoped at Washington
that Patterson with his strong force, numbering about
twenty-two thousand men, might be able to reinforce
McDowell, while real or pretended operations might
detain Johnston in the valley and prevent him from
reinforcing Beauregard with his much smaller force.
But by retiring to Winchester Johnston had secured
for himself the certainty of joining Beauregard in
time for the battle. When Patterson threw forward
a cloud of skirmishers as if intending to offer
battle at Winchester and secure the mountain passes
into eastern Virginia, it did not take the ceaselessly
active cavalry leader J. E. B. Stuart many hours of
continuous skirmishing within his enemy's lines to
discover that the movement was a feint and that
Patterson was in fact hurrying the main body of his
army toward Manassas, by way of Harper's Ferry
and Washington.</p>
<p>Even before Stuart definitely reported this fact,
Johnston had so far penetrated Patterson's purpose
that he began his own movement toward Manassas,
sending first the heavier and more slowly moving
corps across the mountains to a point where railroad
transportation was to meet them, and thus clearing
the way for the cavalry and the lighter infantry and
the well-horsed field batteries to proceed over country
roads without the assistance of railroad cars.</p>
<p>Thus the "pepper box" system of strategy which
prevailed at Washington met its first defeat. If
Patterson had been sent at the outset to strengthen

<pb id="VAC0885-219" n="213"/>
                    
McDowell the result of the battle of Manassas might
or might not have been different from what it was.
But at any rate that arrangement would have given
to McDowell a much greater preponderance of
strength than he actually had on that battlefield. If
Patterson had not gone to the valley of course
Johnston would not have gone thither to meet him,
and the bulk of Johnston's force would have been
added to Beauregard's. But Patterson's army very
largely outnumbered the force that Johnston had at
Winchester within striking distance of Manassas, so
that the total result of the plan of concentration would
have been to strengthen McDowell.</p>
<p>More important still is the fact that while Johnston
actually got a large part of his army to Manassas in
time to decide the battle, Patterson never got there
at all. So in considering the policy that sent Patterson
to the valley, instead of sending him to the line
of Bull Run, we are entitled to reckon it as the cause
of Patterson's complete absence from a field on which
his valley adversary was present with timely and
sorely needed strength.</p>
<p>In the meantime and throughout the summer there
was a civil war going on in Missouri with varying
fortunes. It occupied many thousands of men who
might perhaps have been more wisely and effectively
employed in aid of the one great movement upon
Richmond, which if it had been thus made conspicuously
successful, would pretty certainly have made
an end of the war before it had had time to develop
its strength. Those operations in Missouri had a

<pb id="VAC0885-220" n="214"/>
                    
dramatic interest of their own. But they in no way
bore upon the problems of grand strategy which were
meanwhile the proper and legitimate objects of
supreme concern and consideration by the two stalwart
contestants.</p>

<p>At midsummer, 1861, there occurred near Manassas
Junction in Virginia a battle which must always
be regarded as one of the most remarkable of
conflicts whether we consider its unusual event or its
extraordinary sequences.</p>
<p>The battle was utterly untimely in its happening.
It was a contest of the unready with the unready.
It was brought about by influences peculiarly un-
military and in defiance of the judgment of all the
military men who had aught to do with it. We shall
see hereafter in how strange a way it produced effects
precisely the opposite of those that were legitimately
to be expected of it; how to the victors in it it brought
a paralysis of enterprise far greater than disaster
itself could have wrought.</p>
<p>The Confederates lay at Manassas Junction thirty
miles or so southwest of Washington, with a force
numbering by official report 21,833 men and twenty-
nine guns. The Federals had in front of Washington
a total available force of 84,000 men. On both
sides the men were volunteers, unused to the ways of
war and unfit to enter upon a great battle. In this
respect, as has been already said, the Confederates
had somewhat the advantage in the fact that their
volunteers were accustomed to outdoor life and to the

<pb id="VAC0885-222" n="216"/>

use of firearms, while those on the Federal side were
largely drawn from the counter, the bookkeeper's
desk, the factory, the farm, and the village. But on
both sides they were untrained, undisciplined, un-
learned in the arts of war, and so loosely organized
that their organization could scarcely at all be considered
as an element of strength.</p>
<p>To offset this small Confederate advantage the
Federals had behind them supply departments almost
perfect, while the Confederates were very nearly
starved to death by official incompetency in those departments
even at that early period of the war.</p>
<p>At Manassas they were perilously short not only
of provisions and forage, but even of water, all by
reason of an extraordinary incapacity on the part of
supply departments that began their careers by
strangling themselves and their armies with red tape.</p>
<p>The facts of this matter have been set forth in
detail in General Beauregard's official reports, and
in other authoritative publications. Only a synopsis
of them is necessary in this history. The Confederate
army lay at Manassas in the midst of a country
abounding in supplies, but its quartermasters and
commissaries were not permitted to draw upon that
source of supply even in the smallest way. For
months, before and after the battle of Manassas, an
entirely unused railroad--the Manassas Gap line--
lay idle. It penetrated a country to the west of the
army whose granaries were full, whose smoke-houses
were rich in food, and whose fields were laden with
ripening corn. A country similarly rich in food lay
to the north, between the Federal and Confederate

<pb id="VAC0885-223" n="217"/>

lines. Its supplies were sure to fall into Federal
hands presently if not seized upon by the Confederates
while they had opportunity. But the Confederate
supply departments at Richmond absolutely
forbade their own lieutenants at Manassas to feed
and forage the army from such easily available
sources. They forbade any food or forage purchases
to be made in that region except by purchasing
agents of their own, and they required that all food
and forage so purchased in the immediate neighborhood
of the army should be shipped to Richmond over
the already overburdened, single track Virginia Central
railroad, and shipped back again in such meager
doles as the broken-down railroad could carry.</p>
<p>This peculiar imbecility of management continued
till very nearly the end of the war to keep the Confederate
armies half starved or wholly starved even when
their camps lay in the midst of available plenty. The
difference between the admirable management of
the supply departments at the North and the phenomenally
stupid management of the like departments at
the South was, from beginning to end, the full equivalent
of an army corps' difference in the number of
fighting men.</p>
<p>Besides Beauregard's army there was a small force
at Fredericksburg from which Beauregard was able
to draw 1,355 men and six guns in time for the battle.
In the last preceding chapter it has been shown how
Johnston succeeded in transferring a large part of
his army--6,000 men and twenty guns--to Manassas
in time for the battle, while none of Patterson's regiments
or batteries succeeded even in placing themselves

<pb id="VAC0885-224" n="218"/>

within supporting distance of the Federal
army there engaged.</p>
<p>Thus, according to the official reports, the Confederates
had in all 29,188 men and fifty-five guns with
which, in a strong position of their own selection, to
meet the advance of McDowell's force estimated by
the best Northern authorities at about 34,000 men.</p>
<p>If Patterson had not been sent to the valley at all,
but to Washington instead, the Federal force would
have been swelled to 55,000 or 60,000 men, while
Beauregard's strength could not have been increased
by more than a few thousands at most. In that case
the result of the first great battle of the war might
or might not have been different from what it was--
for with wholly untrained troops strength is not always
to be accurately measured by numbers. But in
any case the probability would have been greatly increased
that the first battle of the war should be the
last and that the country by quick and complete victory
should be spared four years of desolating war
that threw homes by scores of thousands into the
shadow.</p>
<p>The battle was brought about not in answer to any
consideration of military propriety but solely in response
to ignorant but irresistible popular clamor.
The people of this country knew nothing of modern
war or of the conditions that govern success or failure
in it. The latest national recollection of war was of
the unequal conflict with Mexico nearly a decade and
a half before. The American people had never seen
assembled in their name and behalf an army half so
great as that with which their patriotism had now 

<pb id="VAC0885-225" n="219"/>

responded to the country's call. In front of Washington
and in the near-by valley of Virginia they had
between fifty and sixty thousand men, while their
adversaries could muster there only a little more than
half as many.</p>
<p>Knowing little of the difference between uniformed
men with arms in their hands and seasoned soldiers,
the people at the North grew violently impatient of
the delay. They had furnished their Government
twice as many armed men as the enemy could count,
and they could not understand why the double force
thus created should not go on at once to make an end
of what they regarded as the "nonsense down there
in Virginia."</p>
<p>So confident had been the conviction at the North
that this was a petty outbreak to be suppressed easily
and quickly, that a large part of the enlistments were
for no more than three months. That period seemed
to them more than adequate to the task in hand, and
it had been deemed needless to take young men away
from their homes and their employments for a greater
length of time.</p>
<p>It is plain enough that the administration at Washington
at first shared this conception of the case.
Otherwise it would neither have called for nor accepted
three months volunteers.</p>
<p>But the three months were now nearly expired,
and nothing had been done to make an end of the
"nonsense." The terms of service of many regiments
were soon to expire and there seemed to be no general
disposition on the part of the men composing them
to enter into new enlistments. It was obvious that

<pb id="VAC0885-226" n="220"/>
                    
unless the "army" at and near Washington should
go forward at once, crush Beauregard's greatly inferior
force, march on to Richmond and make an end
of the difficulty, new levies must be called for and a
new strain put upon the endurance and the patience
of the people.</p>
<p>All this impatience found daily and often intemperate
expression in the newspapers, whose rivalry
in clamor fanned the flame of discontent among the
people. Desk strategists who knew nothing of war's
conditions had an easy task in figuring out with their
blue pencils an absolutely certain victory for the
Federal arms, if only the Federal generals could be
persuaded or compelled by public opinion to avail
themselves of their matchless opportunity. "Are not
two more than one? And have not we the two to our
enemy's one? What dullards and laggards our generals
must be to delay for a day or an hour!" So ran
the editorial argument, and that argument seemed to
the people conclusive and convincing, for the reason
that the people generally were as ignorant as the
strategists of the editorial rooms themselves concerning
the conditions that govern battle and the training
necessary to convert civilian volunteers into soldiers
fit to face a fire of musketry and cannon.</p>
<p>The military men knew better, of course. Except
the superannuated commander-in-chief, General
Scott, not one of them had ever commanded so much
as a brigade in battle, but at least they had been
taught in a military school and many of them had seen
fighting. They knew the peril of hurling ill-organized
regiments of utterly untrained and undisciplined


<pb id="VAC0885-227" n="221"/>

civilians upon the chosen positions of an armed foe,
even when that foe's forces were in a like condition of
undisciplined inefficiency. The arithmetical argument
in no degree deceived them. They knew that
with such men as they had under their command
strength could not be safely reckoned by a mere
numerical count, that under certain easily imagined
conditions, indeed, strength must often be in inverse
ratio to numbers. They perfectly knew that for them
to advance against the Confederates with an army in
such condition as theirs was at that time was to take
a fearful risk of defeat, disastrous and demoralizing
to the army and dangerously discouraging to the
country behind the army.</p>
<p>But the demand on the part of press, pulpit and
people for an immediate advance was too insistent,
too clamorous, and was rapidly becoming too angry
to be longer resisted. It was reinforced by an almost
equally insistent demand on the part of the civilian
authorities at Washington, whose ignorance of military
conditions was scarcely less pronounced than that
of the excited editors and orators of the country.</p>
<p>It was decided therefore to advance the army and
bring on the hazardous battle against the better judgment
of every trained military man at Washington.</p>
<p>General Scott was still in supreme command of
the army, but he was much too old and too feeble to
conduct the perilous enterprise in person. General
Irwin M1cDowell was chosen to plan the battle and
fight it. He had never commanded an army before
or conducted a campaign, but neither had any other
officer then available, and his technical knowledge of

<pb id="VAC0885-228" n="222"/>
                    
strategy was thorough. On this occasion his plan of
battle was admirable, one of the best, General Sherman
has said, that was formed at any time during the
war. It was essentially identical with that afterwards
adopted by General Lee at the Seven Days' Battles
and again at Chancellorsville.</p>
<p>A reconnoissance in force was made against the
Confederate lines along Bull Run on Thursday, the
eighteenth of July, which disclosed the fact that the
Confederates were fully entrenched in a strong position
which commanded the crossings of the stream
and the plateau over which it must be approached.</p>
<p>Having found out all this, General McDowell decided
to bring on a battle on Sunday, July the twenty-
first.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of the present writer to tell
the story of Manassas or that of any other battle in
military detail. That has been done too often already,
to the hopeless confusion of the civilian reader's mind.
Only an intelligible outline is attempted here, with no
effort to locate this or that division or brigade or regiment
or battery upon the field or to follow out the
details of any movement made by any of them.</p>
<p>Beauregard held his line along the stream known
as Bull Run, over a space of several miles. This line
had been established in defense of the railroad "junction"
at Manassas where the line of the Orange and
Alexandria railroad joined that of the Manassas
Gap railroad. This position was suggested by the
artificial geography of railroad construction. It was
defended by the natural physical geography of Bull
Run, which furnished the Confederates a comparatively

<pb id="VAC0885-229" n="223"/>

good, though by no means a strategically satisfactory,
line of defensive fighting.</p>
<p>McDowell's purpose was to assail the Confederates
on their extreme right, there making a feint as if to
force a crossing of Bull Run at that point which he
did not at all intend; to march his stronger battalions
to his own right along roads substantially parallel with
Bull Run; here and there to divert a force to the Bull
Run line and make fighting there by way of preventing
Confederate concentration at any point and
finally to hurl all his force with irresistible fury upon
the extreme left of the Confederate line, which he
intended and confidently expected to turn and overwhelm
with his superior numbers.</p>
<p>It was McDowell's plan to deceive the Confederates
as to his point of decisive attack, to keep them
busy all along the Bull Run line and, late in the day,
to envelop their left wing, crush it by superior force,
capture the railroad and perhaps compel Beauregard's
surrender for lack of a line of retreat.</p>
<p>The plan worked well for a time. The attacks of
McDowell's divisions upon the Confederate right and
center were stoutly and successfully resisted at every
point, but they were made with determination and
they served their purpose of deceiving the Southern
commander or at least of preventing him from withdrawing
heavy forces from that part of the field for
the defense of his left against the final and crushing
assault which McDowell intended to make there, and
in preparation for which he was all day moving his
heaviest columns in that direction along roads not
visible from the Confederate lines.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-230" n="224"/>
                    
<p>When at last that assault was made, it found
Beauregard inadequately prepared for it; but, with
the determination and energy which were the dominant
traits of his character, the Confederate general
held his ground obstinately and hurriedly moved
troops from the right to the left of his line.</p>
<p>The fighting raged furiously at this critical point
and for a considerable time its result was in doubt,
with the chances strongly in favor of the Federals.
Three times the tide of battle ebbed and flowed across
the disputed field, both sides fighting with a courage
and obstinacy that were scarcely to have been
expected of troops so little inured to the work of
war.</p>
<p>When the struggle was at its fiercest, and at the
moment when the promise of it seemed to be that
the Federals would overwhelm and crush their sorely
outnumbered adversaries, a strong detachment of
Johnston's troops from the Valley, long delayed on
their railroad journey, reached the field. Their orders
were of the vaguest, but they plainly saw an overmastering
Federal force pressing the Confederates
very hard in their immediate presence. So, following
the Napoleonic instruction to go to the point of heaviest
firing the officers commanding the arriving Confederates
went at once into the thick of the fight.</p>
<p>It was the work of a brief time for these fresh men
to envelop the advancing Federal right wing and
crush it to pulp.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the sorely beset left wing of the
Confederates had been enabled to hold its ground and
save itself for a time from complete disaster, only by

<pb id="VAC0885-231" n="225"/>
                    
the obstinate courage of a brigade of Virginians
under General Thomas Jonathan Jackson--a West
Pointer who had long ago resigned from the old
army to become a professor in the Virginia Military
Institute, and who had now become a brigadier-general
of Virginia volunteers. He had already so completely
won the hearts and dominated the minds of
his men that--raw volunteers as they were--they had
no thought of faltering or flinching in the presence
of any danger, so long as their chieftain bade them
stand fast. One after another the battalions with
which they had touched elbows were beaten back before
a leaden hailstorm, or torn to shreds by cannon
fire at murderously short range, or fairly forced to
the rear by bayonet-armed phalanxes, while their own
brigade line was steadily withering under the destructive
fire. But they were under inspiration of
a leader whom they loved and whose courage was
inspired by a religious faith as unfaltering as that of
any Mussulman fanatic, and so they stood steadfast
in spite of all. They looked for their orders only
to that great, calm, passionless leader, and from him
alone they took their impulse. Scarcely at any time
during a war that abounded in illustrations of heroism,
was there, on either side, a more conspicuous
example of the courage that endures, than that which
was afforded by Jackson and his Virginians at that
most critical moment of the first great battle. It
excited admiration and inspired others with courage
even in that hour of seemingly hopeless defeat. General
Bee, who was destined a few minutes later to
become a martyr to his own courage, seeing it, cried

<pb id="VAC0885-232" n="226"/>

out to his wavering men: "There stands Jackson like
a stone wall," and appealed to them to emulate the
example of their comrades and "rally on the Virginians."
From that hour to this the title "Stonewall"
has clung to the fame and memory of Jackson
more closely than his own proper name has done.</p>
<p>Under the fierce onset of Johnston's fresh men,
supported by rallying brigades that had for a time
faltered and yielded ground, and reinforced from
the Confederate right, the Federal assailing column
was quickly crushed and forced to retire, the Confederates
pressing hotly upon their heels.</p>
<p>Then occurred that insane panic in the Federal
army which has never been explained or accounted
for except upon the insufficient ground that its victims
were men without discipline and wholly unused
to war. The explanation leaves much to be desired.
The men who yielded to that panic impulse had already
on that day proved themselves brave fellows,
quite capable of doing soldiers' work right gallantly.
They had fought with vigor, determination and high
courage through long and bloody hours. They had
been the assailants where assault required a greater
courage than defense and they had done their soldierly
work altogether well. They had been baffled of victory
in the crowning hour of the battle, but they
perfectly knew that their columns still outnumbered
those of their adversary, and they must have known
that in an orderly withdrawal from the scene of the
conflict they were not in the least degree likely to be
destructively assailed in their turn. Nothing was
more unlikely indeed, than that the Confederates,

<pb id="VAC0885-233" n="227"/>
                    
having exhausted their freshness of vigor in the
battle and having achieved their immediate purpose
by repelling their enemy's assault, would in their turn
advance upon that enemy, still outnumbering them,
if he had withdrawn in good order and taken up a
strong defensive position at Centreville, only a few
miles away. Had the Federal Army done that, preserving
its cohesion and presenting a determined
front, it is indeed certain that the Confederates would
not have cared to convert their successful defense
into a more than doubtful offense; and even had that
happened through Confederate over-confidence, the
opportunity of the Federals to convert their own defeat
into a conspicuous victory would have been as
tempting as any that an army could desire.</p>
<p>Later in the war after the two armies had been
molded into effectiveness by the stern discipline of
service, some such course as this would undoubtedly
have been pursued. But at Manassas the event was
startlingly different. No sooner did the Federal
troops that had fought so gallantly on the right of
their line find their assault repelled and themselves
forced back than all cohesion, all discipline, all
soldierly qualities went out of them. They broke
ranks and fled in a positively demented panic, which
unfortunately proved to be instantly and universally
contagious. The whole army fell into confusion.
Even those parts of it which had successfully held
their own in severe conflicts throughout the battle
hours broke ranks and ran as an unorganized mob
might at the advance of a force of regulars armed
with bayonets.</p>
                    
<pb id="VAC0885-234" n="228"/>

<p>The Confederates, flushed with unexpected victory
achieved in the moment of defeat, pursued them with
all the quick-moving forces available, chief among
these being Stuart's small body of Virginia cavalry.</p>
<p>There was a report current in the Federal army
that J. E. B. Stuart had under his command thirty
thousand of the finest and most desperately daring
horsemen that had been known in the world since the
days of the Mamelukes. As a matter of fact, he had
under his orders five or six hundred young Virginians.
They knew how to ride their horses, they
knew how to use their revolvers, and they knew in
some degree at least how to handle their sabers. They
had been trained to all that all their lives and perfected
in it at the camp of instruction at Ashland.
But beyond that they had no skill and no superiority
and it was their constant wonder after the battle of
Manassas, that during the chase they almost nowhere
met the cavalry of the other side. They met and
quickly dispersed artillery and infantry, but nowhere
did they encounter men of their own arm of the
service. They had met and fought horsemen in the
Valley of Virginia--for Stuart had been with
Johnston there--but they encountered none such
now.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that the Union army was in an
insane panic and utterly disorganized.  The sole
thought of every man in it was to escape with a
whole skin if that should be in any way possible. The
cavalry men having horses under them put spurs to
their steeds and led instead of protectingly following
a confused and confusing retreat upon Washington.

<pb id="VAC0885-235" n="229"/>

Artillery men cut their horses out of their gun
carriages and caissons, mounted them, and fled bareback
at such speed as the horses could make.</p>
<p>At a little stream a caisson in mad flight was presently
overturned, obstructing a bridge. A great
cloud of panic-stricken soldiers and citizens seeking
an avenue of flight was collected there almost in an
instant. Then up came Kemper of the cannon, powder-
grimed and weary but flushed with the victory.
Using two guns he opened fire upon the confused
crowd at short range, with an effect like that produced
upon a flock of partridges when a charge of
shot is fired into its midst. Then a little squad of
Stuart's cavalry men--ten or a dozen in number--
drew sabers and charged, and a minute later the
creek was full of struggling and drowning men, but
no organized force remained to be charged except
a body of eighty infantry men fully armed, with
bayonets fixed, who stood away on the left. Upon
these the insignificant squad of cavalry men made a
dashing charge, calling out as they galloped: "Throw
down your arms or we'll put you to the sword!" And
so completely demoralizing had the panic become that
these eighty who could instantly have swept the little
band of cavalry men off the face of the earth, not
only dashed their arms to the ground but broke ranks
and ran, every individual man seeking such escape as
might be possible to him.</p>
<p>The men who were so panic-stricken on that fateful
Sunday were not cowards. Many of them fought
valiantly and stalwartly later in the war. They were
simply victims of an insensate and highly contagious

<pb id="VAC0885-236" n="230"/>

panic. They were not yet soldiers. They had not
yet learned the first lesson of the soldier, namely,
the imperative necessity of preserving organization,
fighting every force encountered, and waiting for
orders that must be obeyed at all costs, especially before
giving way to the enemy. Their imaginations
had been inflamed by the stories related at their camp
fires respecting Stuart's mythical Mamelukes and
their terrible skill in horsemanship.</p>
<p>In brief all courage, all cohesion, and all soldierly
quality had completely gone out of the Federal army.
Men who had fought courageously an hour before
had become as hares fleeing from pursuing hounds,
and their flight knew no halting until they had
passed the long bridge into the streets of Washington,
where they paused only to gather breath for a
still further flight if such should become necessary.</p>
<p>In all this the confusion was increased and multiplied
by the presence among the fugitives of a
multitude of panic-stricken picnickers--Congressmen,
civilians of every sort, and lavishly dressed
women--who had gone out in carriages and carryalls
to see the spectacle of a Federal army walking over
the Confederates, and to follow the fleeing rebels all
the way to Richmond, feasting meanwhile upon the
champagne, the boned turkey, the sandwiches and the
truffled game with which they had so lavishly supplied
themselves that the Confederates fed fat for days
afterwards upon the provisions that the picnickers
abandoned in their flight.</p>
<p>The presence of these people within the lines of a
fighting army was in itself a conspicuous illustration

<pb id="VAC0885-237" n="231"/>
                    
of the utterly unmilitary and undisciplined condition
of that army. Imagine, if it be possible to imagine,
such a horde of sightseers attempting to follow
Grant into the Wilderness, or Sherman on his march
to the Sea! But the war was very young when the
battle of Manassas was fought, and so these people
were permitted to be there, to add to the completeness
of a rout that could never have been equaled in its
insanity at any later period of the conflict.</p>
<p>As to the total number of men engaged on either
side at Manassas, the statistics are varying and 
untrustworthy. It is certain that there was no very
great or decisive disparity of numbers. The Federal
army outnumbered that of the Confederates by only
three or four thousand men. General Beauregard
has estimated his total force, including the necessary
garrison of the works, which of course was not actually
engaged, at a total of 29,188 men. According to
Dr. Rossiter Johnson, an unusually accurate and conscientious
historian on the Northern side whose means
of information are of the very best, McDowell's total
force, including those detached to guard the line of
retreat upon Washington, was about 34,000 men.</p>
<p>Exact statistics in such a case are of no moment.
Where armed mobs, undisciplined, ill-organized, and
unused to the strenuous work of war, meet in battle
quite other things than numbers are apt to be decisive.</p>
<p>The Federal commanders reported a loss of 470
killed, 1,071 wounded and 1,793 missing--a total loss
of 3,334 men. The Confederate loss was officially
reported at 387 killed, 1,582 wounded and 13 missing,
making a total of 1,982.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-238" n="232"/>
                    
<p>If greater attention is here given to this first important
battle than to others of larger magnitude to
be treated in future pages of this work, it is because
of the extraordinary effect the battle had, as will be
set forth in the next chapter, and because of the
peculiar danger to which the Confederate victory for
a time subjected the Federal cause.</p>

<p>On the evening of the twenty-first day of July,
1861, the Confederate army at Manassas rested upon
one of the completest and most spectacular victories
that had ever been won by any army over any adversary.
The assailing army had not only been repelled
--all possibility of resistance was gone from it. Not
only had it been driven pell-mell from the field with
every circumstance of demoralization that could add
picturesqueness to its flight, but the uttermost link
of cohesion that could hold its battalions together for
any purpose of resistance was completely broken up
and destroyed. Divisions were dissipated, brigades
were broken into bits, regiments no longer existed and
even companies were scattered to the winds. Only
demoralized and panic-stricken fugitives, each madly
seeking safety, remained. That which had been a
most gallant "army with banners" at sunrise had become
before nightfall a panic-stricken mob without
possibility of cohesion or stamina and utterly without
a sense of soldierly duty.</p>
<p>Then followed the strangest event of the war.
This victory, the completest, the most picturesque,
the most absolute that could be imagined, had the
effect of paralyzing the winners of it to an extent to
which even defeat could not have done.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-240" n="234"/>
                    
<p>The story is too strange and historically of too
much import to be told otherwise than in its fulness.</p>
<p>Let us first consider the character and composition
of the two armies that fought at Manassas. The
Confederate volunteers were enlisted for twelve
months. The term might have been made longer
without the loss of a volunteer. For these young
men, whatever their contract with the Government
might stipulate, fully intended to remain in the service
so long as the war should last. They felt it to be
their own personal war and most of them had nothing
else to do than fight it out to the end, however long it
might endure. Indeed it was certain that so long as it
lasted no young man of the South could long remain
out of the army without incurring damning disgrace
at home.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the organization of the Confederates
when the battle of Manassas occurred was far
more perfect and had far more of permanency in it
than was the case with that of McDowell's forces.
These consisted largely of men who had volunteered
for no more than a three months' service, and the
terms of many regiments were expiring or about to
expire when the call to battle was issued. Many of
those whose terms were at an end turned back on the
very eve of battle--<hi rend="i">four thousand of them quitting
on the day of battle itself.</hi> They refused to participate
in the conflict because their time was up.</p>
<p>This was a manifestation of indifference to all
patriotic and manly considerations such as was nowhere
witnessed on the Southern side at any time
during the war.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-241" n="235"/>

<p>But let us not judge too harshly. These young
men were civilians, not soldiers. They had enlisted
only for a period of three months. They were callow
youths unaccustomed to war. They had regarded a
three months' service in the volunteers as a sort of
exciting picnic excursion to the South. They had
done their duty during the term for which they had
agreed to serve, with very tolerable faithfulness.
They had had their outing. Their frolic was over.
Their contract was fulfilled. They very naturally
wanted to return to their homes. When under such
circumstances a fierce battle confronted them, with
the enemy very manifestly in no "excursion" mood
but bent upon all that was possible of slaughter, is it
any wonder that these young men faltered and failed?</p>
<p>They were scathingly assailed in patriotically inspired
prose and verse, and certainly a similar turning
back on the part of Southern youths on the very eve
of battle would have been punished with an enduring
and all-embracing social ostracism harder to bear than
death. But there were differences between Northern
and Southern sentiment that must be taken into the
reckoning. At the North there was a party more or
less openly opposing the war. At the South there
was none such. At the North the military impulse
did not inspire all minds as it did at the South. At the
North personal courage was not held to be the one
supreme test of manhood, as it was at the South. At
the North a man might fail in that and have laughter
for his portion, while at the South the punishment for
a like fault was the eternal damnation of scorn and
contempt, with universal social outlawry as an accompaniment.

<pb id="VAC0885-242" n="236"/>
                    
If any man in Beauregard's army had
gone home because his enlistment had expired while
the battle was pending he could never more have
visited any neighbor or aspired to any woman's hand;
he would have been everywhere treated with contempt
and measureless scorn. His neighbors would not
have sat on the same bench with him in church. He
would have been instantly rejected as a juryman by
both sides in every case. No other crime that he
might commit could have added in the least degree to
the depth of his degradation.</p>                   
<p>At the North very different standards prevailed.
The poets and the newspaper writers might lavish
opprobrious epithets upon these young men in a
collective capacity without mentioning their individual
names, but their neighbors, their sweethearts,
their daily associates were not apt to take so quixotic
a view of their duty or so severely to judge their conduct.
It must always be borne in mind that men's
standards of duty and obligation are apt to conform
in a general way at least to those of their neighbors.
In passing upon human conduct we must be attentive
to this fact if we would justly judge.</p>
<p>As for the men who went into the fight on the
Union side we must remember that at the end of it
the companies and regiments and brigades of which
they had formed a part in the morning had been dissipated
into the thinnest of thin air at three o'clock in
the afternoon by the lightning-like stroke of panic.
There were no longer any companies left or any
regiments or any brigades or any organizations of
any other sort. There was no longer any such thing

<pb id="VAC0885-243" n="237"/>
                    
as cohesion among them. There was nobody authorized
to give orders--nobody capable of enforcing
obedience. The multitude of men who in the morning
had seemed to constitute an army had been
resolved before nightfall into a wild-eyed and uncontrollable
mob of irresponsible fugitives, intent only
upon seeking safety, without any regard whatever to
any obligation or impulse, of honor or duty or shame
--any impulse except the instinct of self-preservation.</p>
<p>There were many such panic-stricken fugitives on
the Confederate side also--so many that when Jefferson
Davis met a mob of them on his approach to the
battlefield, he was convinced that the Southern army
had been defeated and broken. But these were individuals
merely, and while their aggregate was large,
it embraced no command, no entire body of troops,
whether company, regiment or brigade. The Confederate
commands remained intact. They preserved
their organizations perfectly and remained absolutely
obedient to orders. At the end of the battle theirs
was not only still an army; it was an army flushed
with victory, illimitably confident both in itself and
in its leaders, eager for further action, clamorous for
advance and ready to do and dare anything and
everything that might promise further glory.</p>
<p>That army eagerly wanted to march at once upon
Washington, and there was absolutely no military
reason why it should not have done so. There was
no fighting force to resist it on the march. There
was no force at Washington which could have seriously
disputed its entry into the city. It could easily
have trampled to earth the feeble resistance it must


<pb id="VAC0885-244" n="238"/>

have encountered at the gateways of the capital.
Stuart, almost with tears on his cheeks, besought permission
to lead such an advance with his handful of
cavalry men, pledging his honor and reputation as a
soldier and all that he hoped for of a future career,
in bail of his promise to clear away every obstacle
and open an unobstructed road to the columns of
Beauregard and Johnston in their victorious march
across the Long Bridge and into the streets of the
Federal capital.</p>
<p>Stuart was accustomed to boast that he never used
profane language. But his impatient cavaliers heard
and heartily echoed some strong words from his lips
when finally the paralyzing prohibition of an immediate
advance came to him in the shape of an order to
encamp his men in a muddy cornfield on that rainy
night, when in his judgment they should have been
gaily galloping on march for Washington as the advance
guard of a victory-inspired army, intent upon
making the most of its success and crowning its
achievements with historic consequences.</p>
<p>Stuart at least anticipated no difficulty in galloping
into Washington and Stuart's stalwart cavaliers were
ready for any enterprise to which that born leader of
men might invite them.</p>
<p>Those Virginia horsemen had been for ten consecutive
days and nights forbidden to remove a saddle.
For ten consecutive days and nights they had stood
at the heads of their horses at feeding time and held
the temporarily removed bridle bit in one hand and the
ear of corn from which the horse was feeding in the
other. For ten consecutive days and nights those

<pb id="VAC0885-245" n="239"/>
                    
men had been ceaselessly in the saddle, their only
sleep being snatched in brief fragments, while their
horses were tethered to their wrists. Yet so eager were
they to follow up this victory that every man of them
"swore like a trooper" on that Sunday evening when
the pursuit was senselessly called off, and every man
of them ejaculated a hearty "amen" to their leader's
vituperation of that superior authority which forbade
him and his devoted cavalry men to ride into Washington
close upon the heels of the broken, panic-
stricken and utterly demoralized Federal fugitives
from the battlefield.</p>
<p>There is now not the slightest doubt that he could
have done this. There is not the smallest question
that if he had been permitted to do it, with a supporting
column of infantry and artillery following as
closely as it could upon his horses' heels, Washington
would have become a Confederate possession on that
Sunday night, and--who knows what else might have
happened? Perhaps four years of the bloodiest of
modern wars might have been spared to the American
people.</p>
<p>However that may be, the historian of the Confederate
War is bound to regard the failure of the Confederates
to follow up their victory and pursue their
broken, fleeing and utterly disintegrated enemy into
Washington during that night and the next morning
as one of the most stupendous blunders recorded anywhere
in history.</p>
<p>It was perfectly well known to the two Confederate
commanders, that Washington was not defended
on the South by any fortifications which a determined

<pb id="VAC0885-246" n="240"/>

assailing column could not easily have run over.
There was only one earthwork, and that an incomplete
one, in the way, and it was so little in the way
that a column moving upon the Federal capital could
easily have passed on toward the city by thoroughfares
that lay quite out of the effective range of its
guns.</p>
<p>In brief there was absolutely no conceivable reason
for the failure of the Confederate generals to follow
up their phenomenal success on the battlefield by an
instant and dramatic march upon their enemy's capital
over a road which was obstructed by nothing more
menacing or embarrassing than huge piles of abandoned
food supplies.</p>
<p>General Beauregard and General Johnston have
courageously and manfully assumed all responsibility
for that failure to advance at the right and critical
moment. For a time that failure was attributed to
the paralyzing hand of Jefferson Davis, who came
upon the field near the end of the battle. But that
accusation was unjust. Mr. Davis has been exonerated
from all responsibility for the failure by the
deliberately recorded testimony of his lieutenants.
Mr. Davis was in fact eager for an immediate
advance which might crown the victory with its
legitimate consequences. He even dictated and
had written out a peremptory order to that effect,
which Johnston and Beauregard persuaded him to
withhold.</p>
<p>Their reasons for doing so have been fully set
forth by themselves. In spite of the facts that lay
before their eyes, they could not believe in the 

<pb id="VAC0885-247" n="241"/>

completeness of the victory they had achieved. Neither
had they confidence in the army that had won that
victory. They were sure that it was tired. They
thought it needed rest. They doubted its trustworthiness.
They had no adequate conception of its
enthusiasm for the enterprise for which it was clamorously
eager. It is one of the embarrassments of war
that a commanding general has sometimes no means
of knowing what the men under his command are
thinking and feeling.</p>
<p>So far were the two Confederate commanders
from appreciating the magnitude and the completeness
of their victory, that after it was all over, and
after events of every kind had demonstrated the extremity
of Federal demoralization, they were by their
own confession, frightened half out of their wits by
the movement of certain Confederate forces which
they believed to be a new and determined advance by
the hopelessly demoralized enemy.</p>
<p>They ought to have known better, of course; but
they did not, and they would not let Stuart teach
them better, though he, with his preternatural activity,
had followed the panic-stricken fugitives far enough
to know what their moral condition was.</p>
<p>Let us frankly recognize facts and take account of
them in the reckoning of history. Johnston and
Beauregard were accomplished officers, familiar with
every detail of technical military duty. But neither
of them was as yet experienced in the command of
armies or the conduct of campaigns. Until a few
months before that battle was fought they had been
mere captains of engineers. Neither had ever 

<pb id="VAC0885-248" n="242"/>

commanded any force greater than a company. Neither
had ever seen an army of proportions half so large as
those of the force that fought at Manassas. Neither
had ever had even the smallest experience in grand
strategy. They were mere apprentices still in the art
of war. They had not yet fully learned their trade.
They utterly failed to understand what their victory
meant. They had no conception of the disorganizing,
disintegrating effects of that victory upon their 
adversaries. They were utterly incapable of understanding
their opportunity or of taking advantage
of it. Because of their inexperience they let slip the
finest opportunity that was at any time afforded to
commanders on either side to achieve a quick and
decisive result.</p>
<p>With no purpose or willingness to undervalue the
ability or the devotion of two officers who afterwards
achieved well-deserved distinction as the commanders
of armies, it may fairly be pointed out that they were
in command at Manassas not because of known and
demonstrated fitness for command, but solely because
of their technical rank in the old, peace-time army of
the United States, where promotion was exclusively
by seniority--perhaps the unsafest ground of promotion
that was ever devised by the evil ingenuity of
officialism and professional self-regard. Whatever
capacity these two officers afterwards developed, it is
very manifest that at the time of the Manassas battle
they both showed themselves incapable of seizing
upon the opportunity that victory offered them in
any such masterful way as that in which Lee afterwards
seized upon far less obvious opportunities at

<pb id="VAC0885-249" n="243"/>

the end of the Seven Days' Battles and again after
Chancellorsville.</p>
<p>Having won the completest and most conspicuous
victory of modern times, they set to work to fortify
themselves for defense against the enemy they had
so disastrously overthrown, precisely as if they had
been beaten in the fight and were called upon to defend
themselves against further aggression at the
hands of an enemy to be feared. Having everything
of opportunity their own way, they threw it all into
the adversary's hands. Having reduced their enemy's
army to pulp they deliberately gave him time and
opportunity to reconstruct it, to reinforce it, to reorganize
and discipline it, as he presently did, into a
superb fighting machine instead of pushing forward
and fighting it vigorously while it possessed no fighting
force at all.</p>
<p>Both sides in this war suffered for a time from this
paralysis of officialism and routine which set inferior
men to command their superiors and balked conclusions
by incapacity. It will be related later in this
history, how Grant--the most masterful man in the
Federal army--was long denied his opportunity by
the arbitrary will of the immeasurably inferior
Halleck, to whom a false system and an old man's
favor gave control in despite of fact and achievement.</p>
<p>At present we deal only with the facts of a single
case. On the night of July 21, 1861, and on the
following morning, there was open to the Confederate
commanders at Manassas an opportunity which
hopefully promised to bring the war to an immediate
end. They utterly failed to embrace that opportunity

<pb id="VAC0885-250" n="244"/>
                    
and the price paid for their neglect was four years
of bloody conflict, involving the loss of lives by
scores of thousands and the infliction of incalculable
suffering upon the American people. At several
other points in the history of the struggle like opportunities
presented themselves, less conspicuously
indeed but none the less positively, to one side or the
other. In many cases they were similarly neglected,
and the war went on with all its horrors.</p>
<p>But if we wonder at the failure of the Confederates
to follow up their victory on the evening of its
achievement and on the days immediately following,
how much greater must be our astonishment at their
failure to take the initiative during the long months
of inaction that followed it, or to make any effort to
direct the further progress of a war upon the success
of which their very existence depended!</p>
<p>The singularly complete victory at Manassas was
won on the twenty-first of July, 1861. That was
almost at the beginning of the season favorable to
military operations in Virginia. Yet after that
battle was over there was no effort made on either
side to utilize the time in military movements of any
kind. The Confederates advanced to Fairfax Court
House and threw their pickets as far forward as
Mason's and Munson's Hills, within a few miles of
Washington, but they undertook no military operations
of importance. They inaugurated no campaigns.
They made no advance upon Washington,
which was the one thing that ordinary intelligence
was entitled to expect at their hands. They did not
at all behave like victors. They nowhere assailed their

<pb id="VAC0885-251" n="245"/>

enemy. They made no effort of any kind to
strengthen themselves, either by the occupation of
strategic positions or by giving battle where battle
promised every chance of victory. They simply sat
still, and their sitting still was one of the most inexplicable
things that ever happened during the Confederate
or any other war. There were several other
pauses of like kind during the gigantic struggle, but
there was none so completely without an explanation,
as was this utter throwing away of half a year of
superb campaigning weather.</p>
<p>On the Northern side the inaction was not only
explained but justified by the utter demoralization of
the army which had been so terribly beaten, and so
utterly disintegrated at Manassas. But nobody has
ever yet offered so much as a plausible suggestion of
a reason for the more astonishing inaction of the Confederates
during all that summer and autumn, when
the very causes of inaction on the other side afforded
the utmost inducement to tireless activity on the
Southern side. At a time when all that could be
desired of achievement was freely open to them, they
sat still, doing nothing except to aid their adversaries
in undoing what had been accomplished by hard
fighting.<ref id="ref_004" rend="super" target="note_004">1</ref></p>
<p>McClellan succeeded McDowell in command of the
Federal army during the month of August. His
difficult problem was to organize that army anew; to
create it out of chaotic elements and in the face of the

<note id="note_004"><ref target="ref_004" rend="super">1</ref>Gen. Beauregard insists that he did indeed submit a plan of 
aggressive campaign a little while after the battle but it involved so much of
preparation that it was rejected at Richmond. As it led to no activity
it has no historic significance.</note>

<pb id="VAC0885-252" n="246"/>

difficulties that were thrown in his way by its experience
in battle. He must give it morale. He must
teach his soldiers the very primer lessons of military
service; he must overcome their phenomenal demoralization
and gradually mold them into a shape fit to
take the field.</p>
<p>An alert enemy, under such circumstances, would
have insisted upon interfering, morning, noon and
night, with the exercises of the adversary's military
kindergarten. A commander on the Confederate
side, possessed of large capacity and energy, would
have interrupted the work of McClellan by daily and
disturbing incursions in force; or more probably still
he would have crossed the Potomac, and forced
McClellan to accept battle in Maryland or Pennsylvania
with his utterly untrained and badly demoralized
volunteers. All of this was so obvious that
dulness itself must have seen it. Yet the two Confederate
generals at Manassas and Centreville seem
never to have opened their eyes to the opportunity,
and so nothing in this way was done.</p>
<p>In  the meanwhile, McClellan was diligently
strengthening himself. He was daily adding to his
forces those new levies of volunteers which came
freely from the North in spite of the disaster at
Manassas. He was also strengthening the fortifications
at Washington in a way that made their conquest
forever afterwards a hopeless enterprise. He
sent out many columns to one point and another, not
to bring on battle, but to practice his men in the school
of the soldier, and to use them to "standing fire" without
flinching.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-253" n="247"/>

<p>Incidentally, these operations brought on only one
action of considerable moment, that which occurred
at Leesburg or Ball's Bluff on the Potomac, on the
twenty-first of October. It was an action involving
rather heavy losses particularly to the Federal troops,
but it had no strategic significance whatever. Military
critics have not been able to conjecture why the
action was brought on at all.</p>
<p>Under orders of General C. P. Stone, Colonel
Baker crossed the Potomac near Leesburg to reconnoiter
at a point where no reconnoissance was needed,
and where no action could by any possibility have
aught of significance or consequence. Colonel Baker
was disastrously defeated and killed. The Union
troops were driven into the river, and large numbers
of them were drowned. The effect of the action was
to increase rather than diminish the demoralization
that the Manassas battle had wrought in the Union
army, and to increase in like proportion the self-confidence
of the Confederates--all but their generals.
'Even after this second victory they did not push their
columns across the Potomac.</p>
<p>To the like result all the minor actions of that time
contributed. McClellan sent out forces to Drainesville,
to Falls Church, to Vienna, and to other points,
with the distinct purpose, as he himself afterwards
explained, of accustoming his demoralized battalions
and his newly enlisted men to the idea of fighting. In
every instance Stuart assailed them promptly and
vigorously, and in every instance except at Drainesville,
where they stood their ground well, they ran to
cover with a precipitancy which convinced the

<pb id="VAC0885-254" n="248"/>

Confederates that there was no stability in them, no
nerve, no soldierly quality whatever. How great a
mistake this was, the subsequent actions of the war
served to demonstrate--actions in which these same
men, properly organized and disciplined, grandly and
gallantly played the part of soldiers.</p>
<p>Apart from these insignificant contests, the war in
Virginia went to sleep after the battle of Manassas,
and to an expectant world was presented the spectacle
of a phenomenally victorious army taking a siesta
upon its arms, while its adversaries recruited and
drilled and fortified, and in every other conceivable
way strengthened themselves for the future. In
brief the victor--the most complete and conspicuous
victor in all the history of the war--having utterly
crushed his adversary, and having for the time being
destroyed in that adversary all capacity for resistance,
meekly adopted the attitude of the vanquished.
An army flushed with victory, an army that had completely
destroyed the fighting force of its enemy, sat
down behind earthworks and waited for more than
half a year for that enemy to recuperate and choose
at its leisure the next date and place of its fighting.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to characterize all this inactivity
in harsh terms. Its stupidity needs no emphasis of
rhetoric. The only excuse that history can find for
the phenomenal failure to compel results either in
July or later, is the fact that Beauregard and
Johnston were merely two ex-captains, who had had
no experience in the command of armies or in the conduct
of great campaigns.</p>

<p>While the Southern army indulged in its siesta
after its victory, and seemed to wait for the war to
come to an end of its own accord, the North was
stirred by that event into more strenuous activity.
Fresh levies were called for, and volunteers by scores
of thousands eagerly responded to the call. New
energy was brought to bear upon the fortification of
Washington, so that the capital city might never
again be in such danger of hostile conquest as it had
been on that fateful twenty-first day of July, and
for a dangerously considerable time afterwards.</p>                   
<p>Multitudes of the fugitives from the Manassas
battle never returned to their duty. In many cases
their term of service expired about that time, so that
they could not be brought back by virtue of any law,
civil or military. In other cases it was not thought
worth while to drag back into the service men whose
demoralization was too complete to admit of the hope
that they might ever again be made effective soldiers.
But their places were promptly taken by eager, patriotic
young men, and General McClellan, with that
rare capacity for organizing which was the distinguishing
characteristic of his genius, molded the raw
levies with almost incredible rapidity into effective
regiments and brigades, a task in which, as has already
been shown, the Confederates mightily aided him.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-256" n="250"/>
                    
<p>But in the meanwhile, the victory of the Confederates
very seriously threatened the Federal cause with
a new and terrible danger--namely, the danger of the
recognition of the Southern Confederacy as an independent
power. Great European nations under the
lead of France and England had already recognized
the claim of the Southern armies to belligerent rights.
That was a measure of humanity and civilization so
obviously proper and necessary that while it temporarily
angered the North, and was construed there as
an unfriendly act, it was presently and of necessity accepted
by the Federal Government which, in its turn,
made an informal but none the less effective recognition
of belligerent rights on the part of the Southern
armies. Without such recognition it would have
been impossible to carry on the war upon anything
like civilized lines. Without it no prisoner could have
been exchanged, no flag of truce could have been
recognized, no cartels could have been agreed upon,
no safe-conducts could have been respected--in short,
without such Federal recognition of belligerent
rights on the part of the Southerners the struggle
must have speedily degenerated into a savage contest.
All prisoners in that case would have been at the
mercy of their captors to do with as they pleased.
There would have been no possible opportunity for
negotiation or for the interchange of any of those
amenities, by means of which the horrors of war are
so greatly mitigated to individuals. There could have
been no paroles. On both sides the prisoners would
have been in the position of captives to a savage foe,
responsible in no way to civilization.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-257" n="251"/>

<p>The recognition of Southern belligerency was so
obviously a necessity of civilization that the Federal
commanders had already assumed it, quite as a matter
of course, from the beginning, and they had daily
acted upon it. But the people, uninstructed as they
were in military law, deeply resented England's act
in recognizing it. They regarded that act as scarcely
less hostile than would have been the formal recognition
of the Southern Confederacy as an independent
nation.</p>
<p>After the battle of Manassas there was very serious
danger of even such a recognition as that. The
South eagerly hoped for it and the North greatly
feared its coming.</p>
<p>At that time England, France and Germany were
looking with very jealous suspicion upon the rising
glory of the American Republic. Their monarchs
feared the influence of Democratic doctrines supported
by such an object lesson as the prosperity and
phenomenal growth of the American nation afforded.
The tradesmen and manufacturers of those countries,
equally with their statesmen, dimly but apprehensively
foresaw what has since in our later time come
to pass. They foresaw the conquest of the world's
markets by American industry. To break up this
American Union meant for them a release from these
dangers, political, commercial and industrial.</p>
<p>Moreover, the United States Government was at
that time just entering upon a new and extreme
policy of protective tariff exclusion which threatened
very serious detriment to the trade of the manufacturing
countries of Europe. The South, being an 

<pb id="VAC0885-258" n="252"/>

agricultural country with scarcely any manufacturing
interests, stood for the utmost possible freedom of
trade. Very naturally, the manufacturing and commercial
nations of Europe looked with more or less
favor upon a revolution in this country, which promised
to give them not only an equal commercial
chance but a sentimental advantage also in the Southern
markets in competition with the New England
fabricators of goods, wares and merchandise.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, the South had looked to
such impulses and interests as these as an offset to
Northern   superiority in  numbers and resources.
The South hoped from the beginning for foreign
intervention. It was confidently believed that if any
European nation should formally recognize the
Southern Confederacy's independence, the United
States would treat that recognition as equivalent to
an open declaration of war. In such an event the
recognizing nation must of course send its fleets to
raise the blockade of Southern ports, and possibly
also its battalions to stand shoulder to shoulder with
the Virginians and Carolinians and Mississippians on
hard fought battle fields.</p>
<p>The Confederate victory at Manassas, by reason
of its completeness and still more by reason of its
spectacular accompaniments, gave peculiar force to
all these arguments in favor of that European recognition
of Southern independence which must have
threatened the final disruption of the American
Union, the breaking down of the most dangerous
trade rival of those countries, the opening of the
South to absolute free trade, with a distinct preference

<pb id="VAC0885-259" n="253"/>

for English, French and German over "Yankee"
goods, and the political weakening of that
growing impulse to republicanism which resided in the
glory and greatness of the American Republic. To
dissolve and destroy the Union would have been once
and for all time to make an end of the most potent
influence that ever existed on earth in behalf of a
"world without kings, and a people supreme."</p>
<p>When the battle of Manassas was done, and
McDowell's army had fled in panic as a disorganized
mob into Washington, and was manifestly prepared
to flee farther if it should be pressed with vigor, as
every foreign observer expected that it would be,
there was every inducement and every excuse for the
recognition of the Southern Confederacy by European
nations, and for their demand that the still
ineffective blockade should be raised as an unjustifiable
interference with international commerce. Such
action on the part of France and England would
undoubtedly have precipitated war between those
countries and the United States, and in that war,
knowing as we do the relations then existing between
European nations, Austria, Italy and Prussia would
very probably have joined. What the consequences
would have been each reader must judge for himself,
but at the very least it may be said with entire safety
that such a circumstance would have added very
greatly to the embarrassment of the United States
Government, and to the chances of ultimate success
on the part of the South.</p>
<p>The pretender who sat at that time upon the fraud-
buttressed throne of France and called himself

<pb id="VAC0885-260" n="254"/>
                    
"Napoleon III" was ready and eager for such interference.
But he dared not undertake it single
handed. He sought the alliance and aid of England,
and without doubt he would have secured both but
for one fact. Whatever policies an English government
may favor, there is always behind that government,
as its master, the sentiment of the British people,
and that sentiment was at that time unalterably
and implacably hostile to human slavery.</p>
<p>It was the misfortune of the South that its contention
for its own right of self-government was inseparably
linked in the minds of men abroad with the
cause of human bondage, against which British public
sentiment revolted.</p>
<p>Great Britain is not a republic in our sense of the
word, but under all its forms of monarchy, and with
all its embarrassments of aristocratic privilege, its
people actually and absolutely rule.</p>
<p>Its people strongly sympathized with the Southern
claim  of a right of autonomy. They still more
strongly sympathized with themselves in their desire
to cripple their greatest and most threatening commercial
and industrial rival, and to get all the cotton
they needed for their mills.  They wanted the war
to end quickly. They wanted the Southern ports
opened to their ships, and the Southern cotton to be
accessible again for their use. They wanted the
American Union broken up. They wanted to trade
with the Southern States upon equal terms or with a
positive advantage over their New England competitors.
But even for such sake they were unwilling
to lend the power of Great Britain to the perpetuation
of human slavery anywhere upon earth.</p>
                    
<pb id="VAC0885-261" n="255"/>

<p>There was the fatal miscalculation of the Southerners.
They reckoned with British trade interests,
with British and other European political prejudice,
but they did not sufficiently reckon with that British
hostility to slavery which--whatever the political or
trade considerations might be--would not consent to
any action on the part of a British government which
should even seem to make Great Britain responsible
for the perpetuation of human slavery anywhere.</p>
<p>Thus the British government was restrained by the
all-dominating British sentiment from interfering,
and France did not venture to interfere alone or even
with the probability of Austrian or Prussian support.</p>
<p>There was Russia to be reckoned with, also, and as
later official publications show, the Czar not only set
his face against intervention in behalf of the South,
but at one critical time actually sent his fleets to
American waters to menace any and every power that
might assume to interpose to the detriment of the
United States.</p>
<p>At the time, however, the Manassas victory gave
great and well-justified occasion for the fear at the
North that Great Britain and France, backed by the
other western European powers, might be persuaded
to interpose in behalf of the Confederates. For a
time, therefore, the outlook for the Union was a very
gloomy one, but the youth of the country continued
to enlist by tens and scores of thousands, and in spite
of the hostility of a political party strongly opposed
to the administration and to the war itself, Mr.
Lincoln's government went on with its preparations
for prosecuting the war with vigor, to its predestined
end.</p>

<p>During the long period of strange inactivity in
those parts of the country where the real seat of war
lay, there was a good deal of active fighting elsewhere.
Some of it was severe and gave rise to
stirring  events, including  some stoutly contested
battles. But with the exception of the operations
upon the Southern coasts in aid of a more effective
blockade none of these conflicts had any considerable
strategic importance and the story of them may with
propriety be briefly told.</p>
<p>In Missouri the contest was in effect a civil war, in
the strict acceptation of that term. It is needless
and it would be tedious to recount here the proclamations,
the gubernatorial manifestos, the legislative
resolutions and the so-called conventional action
of that state.  None of these had any undisputed legal
sanction whatever, though each of them claimed
all possible legality. The simple fact was that a
part of Missouri's people adhered to the Union and
another part equally clung to the cause of the
Southern Confederacy. After much confusion the
Unionists formed an army under General Lyon
and the Confederates assembled a strong force under
General Price. Let the lawyers quibble as they please
over the technicalities involved, the fact remains as

<pb id="VAC0885-263" n="257"/>
    
already stated, that the people of Missouri were
divided in sentiment; that they arrayed themselves
against each other in hostile armies; and that they
fought each other in considerable battles--measured
by the number of men engaged and by the slaughter
involved. But these battles bore no influential relation
to the contest between the Union and the Confederacy,
except in so far as their conduct served to
occupy troops on either side who might have been
much more effectively employed at those more eastern
points at which the issue was in fact to be fought
out to a conclusion.</p>
<p>At Carthage, Missouri, where General Franz Sigel
attacked the Confederates on July fifth, 1861, the
Federals were beaten and forced to retreat. At Dug
Spring, August third, Lyon defeated McCulloch, but
a week later (August the tenth), the Federals were
again defeated in a severely contested battle at Wilson's
Creek, and General Lyon was killed.</p>
<p>On the fifth of March, 1862, the two armies west
of the Mississippi met in a pitched battle at Pea
Ridge, Arkansas. The contest was a fierce and
bloody one, involving a heavy, though unascertained
loss. The Federals had distinctly the better of it, but
like the Confederates at Manassas, they utterly failed
to follow up their victory or in any other way to give
effect to it.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to relate the story of these battles
in detail. They were gallant and strenuous actions,
reflecting the highest credit upon the courage of the
officers and men engaged on either side. But they
contributed nothing whatever to the ultimate result.

<pb id="VAC0885-264" n="258"/>
                    
They played no part in the solution of the war problem.
Whether the actions so gallantly fought by
Federals and Confederates alike were won by the
one or by the other, made no difference in the ultimate
outcome of a war which was clearly destined to be
decided by other men and upon other fields of larger
strategic significance.</p>
<p>The operations in Kentucky and Tennessee, though
smaller in themselves, were of much greater importance.
Those states lay within the strategic field.
Kentucky had officially assumed an attitude of neutrality,
as has already been related, to which neither
side paid or could be expected to pay the smallest
attention. That state lay between the North and the
South. It was absolutely necessary that each should
push armed forces into and across its domain in order
to get at the forces of the adversary. Moreover, Kentucky's
assumption of neutrality was a transparent
absurdity in itself. If it could have commanded respect,
it would have interposed a neutral ground,
stretching for about four hundred miles from east
to west between the contending armies, neither of
which would have been privileged on any account to
cross it or to enter it. Thus Kentucky, while retaining
its place as a state in the Union, would have stood
as a protective barrier to the seceding states, of even
greater value than all the armies that could have been
assembled within Kentucky's borders. It would at
one and the same time have held the position of a
state in the Union and the most potent of all states in
aid of the Confederacy.</p>
<p>It is necessary to explain that this Kentucky resolution


<pb id="VAC0885-265" n="259"/>
    
of neutrality never had the complete legal sanction
of the state authorities, actual or pretended; but
its effect was so small that it is scarcely worth while
to discuss the technicalities. The simple fact was that
Kentucky furnished men to both sides and that its
legislative and its executive authorities were never at
any time fully and legally agreed upon any policy
whatever.</p>
<p>In a history that takes account of facts rather than
of theories, of events rather than of resolutions, there
seems no occasion to follow this subject further,
except to say that both Federals and Confederates
presently pushed their armies into Kentucky and tried
conclusions there, with results that must form the
subject of future pages in this history.</p>
<p>In Maryland the struggle ended in the adherence
of the state to the Union, while a large part of its
vigorous young manhood went South and enlisted in
the Confederate army. It was this division of sentiment,
this separation of families, this arraying of
brother against brother, that constituted the tragedy
of the Confederate war.</p>
<p>In North Carolina and in Tennessee there was a
strong Union sentiment among the mountaineers. It
could not control either state, but it resulted in the
enlistment of a large number of hardy volunteers in
the Union armies, and in the organization of an
efficient "underground railroad," by means of which
Northern soldiers escaping from Southern prisons
were aided in their journey to the North.</p>
<p>In Virginia the anti-secession sentiment found expression
in an act of secession from secession. The

<pb id="VAC0885-266" n="260"/>

western half of that state had scarcely any property
interest in slavery and scarcely any sympathy with the
institution. The men of that region had accepted the
teachings of Thomas Jefferson, and George Wythe,
and a score of other Virginian statesmen, to the effect
that slavery was a curse which it was their duty to extirpate
as soon as might be. The secession of their
state seemed to offer them an opportunity. If secession
was to be the order of the day, why should not
they, as representatives of the western and non-slave-
holding half of their state, repudiate secession from
the Union by themselves seceding from their seceding
state?</p>
<p>Upon this hint they acted. They proceded to set
up the state of West Virginia under an autonomy
granted by the National Government. It was in
direct violation of the Federal Constitution thus to
divide a state without its own consent, but the thing
was done in war time, and when war is on the rigid
letter of the law is very apt to be disregarded in the
interest of general results. At any rate the thing
was done, and West Virginia has ever since 1863 held
her place as one of the states of the Union.</p>
<p>Thus were the border states arrayed in the war.
Thus was the issue made up. Thus were the lines
drawn for the momentous conflict.</p>

<p>As soon as the fact was recognized that war existed
between the Northern and the Southern states it was
quite a matter of course and of common sense that the
Federal Government should endeavor to shut in the
Confederates by a blockade that should cut them off
from all commerce with the outer world.</p>
<p>The South was almost exclusively an agricultural
country. It had scanty means of supplying itself
with any of those articles of manufacture which enable
communities to live and to carry on war. It was
sadly deficient not only in capacity to create arms,
ammunition, and other fighting equipments, but also
in factories capable of turning out clothing, shoes,
medicines, and the like either for military or for non-
military use.</p>
<p>For all these things the Confederates depended
upon importation, and the obvious policy of the Federal
Government was to prevent such importation.</p>
<p>If that could have been completely done, the war
must of necessity have come to an early and merciful
end. And there is no doubt that it might have been
done during the first years of the struggle if practical
common sense had been reinforced by executive ability

<pb id="VAC0885-268" n="262"/>
    
commensurate with the demands of the occasion.
As a matter of fact this was never completely accomplished
until the war was in its last throes. To the
very end the Confederate soldiers were clad in English-made
cloth, shod with English-tanned leather, and
largely fed upon Cincinnati bacon and corned beef
which had been shipped to Nassau in the Bahamas
and thence carried into Confederate ports by the daring
of the English captains and the English crews
of English-built and English-owned blockade running
steamers. Very naturally the Federal Government
understood and appreciated all these conditions,
and very naturally it sought to take advantage of
them by blockading Southern ports and thus preventing
or at least embarrassing those importations
upon which the South must mainly depend for its
powder, its bullets, its clothing, its shoes, its arms and
its provisions.</p>
<p>Accordingly, one of the earliest acts of the Administration
was the proclamation of a blockade of the
Southern ports. This was issued as early as the nineteenth
of April, 1861, two days after the Virginia
Convention adopted an ordinance of secession and
thus made war a certainty.</p>
<p>There is this peculiarity about the international
law of blockade, that the ships of no nation are under
obligation to respect a blockade until it shall be made
effective. That is to say, until the nation proclaiming
the blockade can put a sufficient naval force at
the mouth of each blockaded harbor to prevent the
entry of ships, no foreign shipmasters are bound to
respect the proclamation of blockade, and their 

<pb id="VAC0885-269" n="263"/>

blockade-running ships are not subject to seizure in the
attempt to pass the paper barriers erected.</p>
<p>At the first, of course, the blockade of Southern
ports was technical rather than real. A foreign ship
running in or out was not legally subject to seizure
or destruction because the blockade was manifestly
ineffective. But by impressing ferry-boats and every
other craft that could carry guns into the naval service,
the Federal Government was able presently to
make its blockade so far effective that those ships
which essayed to "run" it did so at risk of capture
and with the certainty that capture must mean the
confiscation of both ship and cargo.</p>
<p>But so profitable was this commerce that the merchants
and shipmasters engaged in it were ready to
take all the risks involved, for the sake of its enormous
pecuniary returns. It was a matter of easy
reckoning that a single cargo carried either way and
successfully delivered, would pay for the loss of the
ship and cargo on the return voyage, and leave a rich
margin of profit besides.</p>
<p>Moreover a close blockade was simply impossible.
Not one ship in a dozen that attempted to pass out or
in, was in actual fact captured or driven ashore. The
number of ships engaged in blockade running was
steadily reduced by the increasing dangers encountered,
but the traffic continued, with no effective interruption,
until near the end of the war, the chief
effect of the blockade being to increase the profits of
the English shipowners and shipmasters who engaged
in the perilous commerce and enormously to enhance
the market value of goods of every kind at the South.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-270" n="264"/>

<p>An ounce of quinine that cost $2.80 in Nassau was
worth $1,100 or $1,200 in Charleston, while the 
Confederate money received for the quinine would buy
cotton at ten cents a pound which had a value at the
very least of half a dollar a pound in gold at Nassau.
On such terms the human instinct of gain made it
certain that the blockade, however legally effective it
might be made, would be broken through by daring
shipmasters so long as the war should last and precisely
that is what in fact happened.</p>
<p>But in aid of the blockade, and in aid of the general
policy of shutting the South in and compelling
it to rely exclusively upon its own inadequate resources,
the Federal Government promptly dispatched
forces to the South, to capture the seacoast
fortifications there and to make of the coast a Federal
instead of a Confederate possession and stronghold.
On the twenty-ninth of August, 1861, an expedition
under command of General B. F. Butler, captured
the forts at Cape Hatteras. On the seventh and
eighth of November another expedition reduced the
works at Port Royal and Hilton Head in South Carolina,
thus making of the coast strongholds important
strategic positions for the Northern arms. Later the
whole coast, except the great harbor, was conquered.</p>
<p>It must always be a matter of astonishment to the
historian that greater use was not made of the advantages
thus gained at the beginning of the war. It
is true that the geography of the Carolinian coast
country specially lent itself to the defense of that
region by small forces arrayed against greatly superior
numbers. It is true, for example, that at

<pb id="VAC0885-271" n="265"/>

Pocotatigo, on the twenty-second of October, 1862,
two batteries of artillery and a company or two of
dismounted cavalry numbering in all only 350 men,
being reinforced late in the day by about four hundred
more, succeeded in repelling the all-day assault
of not less than three thousand and ended by driving
the Federal force back to its ships. This was due in
part to the peculiarly defensive nature of the ground
and in part to the certainty that the Federal forces
could not remain over night at Pocotatigo without
finding nearly every man among them stricken with
that dire disease, "country fever," before morning.</p>
<p>But all day long at Pocotatigo the Federals had
the Charleston and Savannah railroad on their left
less than a mile away and with absolutely no obstacle
whatsoever between them and its possession. Beyond
the railroad line lay the high, healthful pine lands.
In brief there was no reason whatever, aside from
mere blundering, why they should not then and there
have seized upon the Charleston and Savannah railroad,
made themselves masters of the entire coast,
and proceeded to the easy conquest or isolation of
Charleston on the one hand and Savannah on the
other.</p>
<p>This particular matter is here mentioned only because
it serves to illustrate a larger truth. From the
time when the Port Royal and the Hilton Head forts
were captured there was never an hour when a capable
and resolute general in command of 5,000 men
--and 50,000 might easily have been sent to him--
could not have made himself master of the main line
of Southern communication, master of Charleston,

<pb id="VAC0885-272" n="266"/>

master of Savannah and practically master of South
Carolina and its neighboring states. An enterprising
officer engaged in accomplishing this would, of
course, have been reinforced to any desirable extent,
and a campaign inland at that point and at that time
would have promised results of the utmost consequence.</p>
<p>Here was another of the errors that served to prolong
through four years a war that ought to have
been brought to an end during its first campaign, and
the needless and senseless prolongation of which
inflicted almost incredible loss and suffering upon the
South and subjected the North to financial burdens
and human sacrifices of the most stupendous character.</p>
<p>The blockade was early made "effective" in that
degree which international law requires--so effective
that shipmasters trying to pass through it had no
conceivable right of redress if their ships were captured,
or blown to pieces, or run ashore by the blockading
squadron. It was never, even unto the end,
made so effective as to prevent British merchantmen
from   trafficking  at uncertain intervals between
Nassau and the Southern ports. It did not and could
not put an end to the importation of the necessaries
of war into Southern ports; but it made such importation
so enormously expensive, even if measured by
the cotton exports on which the trade was based, as
greatly to cripple the Confederacy in its finances.
The price of goods imported at such hazard and with
such difficulty was made great enough to cover the
easy contingency of capture upon the outward as
well as upon the inward voyage.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-273" n="267"/>
                    
<p>He who would understand the events of that period
must constantly bear in mind that during the first
year or nearly that, of its duration this war of ours
was conducted mainly by incapacity on both sides, by
martinet captains and incapables in civil office who
had been suddenly thrust into positions vastly too
great for their abilities.</p>

<p>This was the situation during the year 1861 and
the early part of the year 1862. There were destined
soon to come upon the scene two great masters of the
military art--the one upon the one side and the other
upon the other--Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E.
Lee. But during the early part of the struggle
neither of these great men was in a position of mastery
or control. Grant was struggling against all the
difficulties that technicality and official jealousy could
plant in his pathway. He found it difficult to get into
the service at all. He was a West Point graduate and
he had served with distinction in the regular army,
but he had long ago resigned his commission. He
had thus forfeited all claim to command those who
had remained in the service and who had been promoted
by seniority. These, and not Grant, were
made generals.</p>
<p>When Grant offered his services and asked for the
privilege of fighting the country's adversaries his
application was left absolutely unanswered. His
only way into the army was "by the back door." He
was elected by the men to be colonel of a regiment of
Illinois volunteers, but was not commissioned in the
regular army until after he had conducted a campaign
to the first considerable success achieved by the


<pb id="VAC0885-275" n="269"/>

national arms, and not even then without every embarrassment
and humiliation which it was possible for
his inferiors in superior place to inflict upon him.
Indeed, as will be related later, his first great victory,
the first of any importance that had been anywhere
won for the Federal arms, was promptly punished
by his suspension from command and by the refusal
of his distinctly inferior superiors to let him follow
up his success with other and obviously easy
operations.</p>
<p>On the Confederate side the one masterful military
mind was that of Robert E. Lee. As a matter of
fact it was Lee who selected Manassas as the first
point of resistance, and it was under his wise direction
that Beauregard and Johnston were able to concentrate
their forces there and to win the victory
of July 21, 1861. But in the meanwhile Lee was
not himself appointed to command any considerable
army. He was sent to West Virginia to patch
up a peace between the civilian brigadiers who commanded
there and who had managed among themselves
to lose every action that had occurred in that
quarter.  While Beauregard and Johnston were
weakly throwing away the opportunity so conspicuously
opened to them by the Manassas victory, this
officer of commanding genius was set to the task of
organizing a mountain defense against expeditions
that had nothing of serious purpose in them except
the prevention of Confederate enlistments west of
the Alleghenies.</p>
<p>In the same way, after the Carolina coast forts
were reduced, Lee was sent to a pestilential hole called

<pb id="VAC0885-276" n="270"/>

Coosawhatchie, in South Carolina, to plan a defense
of the railroad line between Charleston and Savannah,
while Johnston and Beauregard were fortifying
their victorious army against a foe that it had beaten
into temporary helplessness.</p>
<p>These two--Grant and Lee--were destined in the
end to fight the war out to a conclusion. But in those
earlier months of it neither was permitted to exercise
his genius in any effective way, or to show in action
what stuff he was made of. Lee indeed held high
rank from the beginning and was the military adviser
of the Confederate Government, but for a time his
genius was dissipated on minor matters, while lesser
men were wasting time.</p>
<p>And as it was with the great captains so was it
with their great lieutenants. William T. Sherman
was an unconsidered, unconsulted lieutenant of McDowell.
Stonewall Jackson and Ewell and Longstreet
were the subordinates of Beauregard and
Johnston. Grant and Sherman on the one side and
Stonewall Jackson on the other, had lost caste in the
military service by resigning from the regular army
at a time when the service neither offered nor promised
a career worthy of them. Inferior men therefore,
who had been content with a meaningless
routine, outranked and commanded these really great
men after that code of military ethics and etiquette
which assumes that the officer--even though he be a
dullard--who has been longest in continuous service
is fit to command the officer--whatever his genius
may be--who has served for a briefer time or who,
finding the service to be a stupid and meaningless

<pb id="VAC0885-277" n="271"/>
                    
routine of camp duty in time of peace, has resigned
from it in search of better opportunities for the exercise
of his abilities, and has returned to it only when
duty to his country has seemed to call him.</p>
<p>Thus the first year of the war was the period in
which official incapacity ruled on both sides; the
period in which technical rank overrode genius and
trampled it to earth; the period in which the martinets
were afflicted with victories which they were
utterly incapable of turning to profitable account,
and defeats which they knew not how to repair.</p>
<p>A better era was approaching, but it came slowly.
For a time Grant was to be dominated by Halleck.
For a time Stonewall Jackson was destined to have
his carefully considered disposition of forces in the
valley of Virginia overridden and canceled by an
ignorant civilian in Richmond, who knew so little of
military courtesy as to send his orders direct and not
through Jackson's commander Johnston.</p>
<p>On the other side, Benjamin F. Butler, a criminal
lawyer, who knew nothing whatever of the military
art, was a major-general by virtue of political influence
alone, and as such outranked and dominated
officers immeasurably his superiors. Think of Lee
banished to the coast of South Carolina, while Beauregard
and Johnston were needlessly fortifying at
Centreville against an absurdly impossible advance
of McClellan's forces. Think of McClellan himself
in command of the most important Union army,
while Grant and Sherman and George H. Thomas
remained in subordinate positions!</p>
<p>And in the navy a similar discrimination against

<pb id="VAC0885-278" n="272"/>

demonstrated capacity and in favor of mere "rank"
equally prevailed. Farragut, with all his already
and abundantly proved capacity, waited for the best
part of a year before he could get permission to bring
his great powers into play, and when at last he got
such permission from the ignorant and arrogant civilians
who dominated the navy department at Washington,
it came to him with an insulting suggestion
of doubt as to his courage, his patriotism and his
capacity. That is a sad story to be told hereafter.
Our present purpose is merely to show how lamely
and incompetently the war was carried on on both
sides during the first year of its progress. He who
considers the simple facts is well nigh forced to the
conclusion that had either side conducted its contest
with half the brains and energy that came later into
play it must have won at once.</p>

<p>The "pepper box" policy of employing small
bodies of troops everywhere for the accomplishment
of ends of no strategic consequence prevailed at
Washington during all those early months of the war.
The results of that policy are the despair of the historian
who would intelligently trace the progress of
the conflict from its beginning to its end. In very
truth there was no progress. So far as the outcome of
the war was concerned those events had no part to
play; so far as the history of the war is concerned, any
attempt to relate their insignificant stories would serve
only to confuse the reader's mind, and to distract his
attention from events and operations that bore directly
upon the ultimate outcome of a struggle which involved
the fate of the nation. Let us leave them
aside as inconsiderable incidents and trace instead
those significant happenings that served to determine
the ultimate results.</p>
<p>The outcome of all great wars is determined in the
end by the personality of the men who conduct them
to a conclusion. Circumstances and even accidents
have their part to play, but in the main it is personality
that determines the event.</p>
<p>So at this point it becomes necessary to consider
General Grant as a factor in the war, "a stone 

<pb id="VAC0885-280" n="274"/>

rejected of the builders," but destined to become the
chief cornerstone, nevertheless, of Federal success.</p>
<p>General Grant was a West Point graduate ranking
low in his class at graduation. He served for a
time in the regular army with such capacity as to
reach the rank of captain. Then he resigned, as
many other officers did--Stonewall Jackson and
William T. Sherman among the number--because
the police duty which seemed to constitute the only
function of the regular army offered no career to
him. Captain Grant became first a farmer and later
a clerk in his brother's business house at Galena,
Illinois, upon a meager salary of $800 a year, which
was eked out by the earnings of his slaves in Missouri.
When the war broke out he offered his services to his
country, asking for a restoration to the regular army.
His application was not deemed worthy even of a
reply. But presently a regiment of Illinois volunteers,
more appreciative than the Washington authorities,
made him its colonel, and after a little while he
was promoted to be a brigadier-general of volunteers,
but still without even so much as a second lieutenant's
commission in the regular army.</p>
<p>In this volunteer capacity he was sent first to
Missouri and later to Cairo in Illinois to command a
wide district. He fought the battle of Belmont and
after a partial victory he lost it. A few months
earlier, learning that the Confederates, who were masters
of Columbus, twenty miles down the Mississippi,
were planning to seize upon Paducah, fifty miles up
the Ohio, Grant had undertaken without orders an
expedition against that town. He promptly captured

<pb id="VAC0885-281" n="275"/>

it and thus defeated the Confederate program.</p>
<p>After the battle of Belmont he planned and proposed
a campaign which he hoped might reverse the
existing situation at the West and give to the Union
arms their first important and strategically significant
victory.</p>
<p>Two great and practically navigable rivers, the
Cumberland and the Tennessee, rise in the very heart
of what was then the Southern Confederacy. Upon
substantially parallel though vastly varying lines, they
flow westward and northward till they debouch into
the Ohio River within a few miles of each other.</p>
<p>At a point near the boundary between Kentucky
and Tennessee where these two rivers flow within
eleven miles of each other, the Confederates had
erected two fortresses to command them--Fort
Henry and Fort Donelson.</p>
<p>These fortresses gave to the South control of the
two rivers. It was Grant's idea that by the reduction
of these works he might reverse this condition of
affairs, and make of the two rivers facile avenues of
Federal access to the heart of the Confederacy,
where now they served the Confederates as roadways
of approach to positions of the utmost strategic importance
to the side that should master and hold them.</p>
<p>But Grant was only a brigadier-general of volunteers,
in no way entitled to plan campaigns or to
make suggestions for campaigns. Halleck had command
of the department, with headquarters at St.
Louis. Halleck was a major general in the regular
army and Grant's "superior officer." Halleck 


<pb id="VAC0885-282" n="276"/>

disliked, distrusted and detested Grant, and so when
Grant asked permission to move against and reduce
the Confederate strongholds on the Tennessee and
Cumberland rivers, Halleck's reply was in effect an
injunction to the inferior officer to mind his own
business.</p>
<p>Grant was so sure, however, of his ability to accomplish
this vitally important task that he persisted in
his entreaties and many weeks were consumed in
fruitless negotiations for the privilege of doing great
work in a great way. At last through the influence
of Commodore Foote, commanding the naval forces
in that quarter, the discredited volunteer general was
graciously permitted by his martinet superior to undertake
and execute the first operation of the war
which crowned the Federal arms with a victory of
strategic importance. This permission, though long
solicited, did not come to Grant until the very end of
January, 1862, and it was in February that the combined
land and naval forces moved for the capture of
the Confederate strongholds.</p>                   
<p>The expedition moved first up the Tennessee river.
Grant had about 15,000 men, a force which was presently
 swelled by reinforcement to 27,000. But his
advance was delayed and the fleet, with scarcely any
assistance from him, captured Fort Henry on the
sixth of February. Then the gunboats steamed down
the river to its mouth and thence up the Cumberland
to assail Fort Donelson. In the meanwhile Grant
pushed across the narrow neck of land between the
two fortresses and closely invested that fort. The
fleet made a determined assault but was beaten off in

<pb id="VAC0885-283" n="277"/>

a badly crippled condition. Grant continued to
assail the enemy's works throughout three days of
storm and sleet and suffering, and at the end of that
time the fortress surrendered with about fourteen
thousand men in addition to a Confederate loss in
killed and wounded of about two thousand. The
greater part of the garrison had previously escaped.</p>
<p>This was the first conspicuous victory achieved
anywhere by the Federal arms. Its moral effect was
incalculable and strategically it was of the utmost
importance. It made an end for the time being of
the war in Kentucky which had been going on for
some time, involving actions of some individual importance,
though they had no vital bearing upon the
strategic history of the war. It made Federal instead
of Confederate highways of the two great
rivers that in their course penetrated almost to the
heart of the Confederacy. It made easy prey of
Nashville as a vantage point from which the Federal
forces might penetrate the South and assail its strongholds
of resistance. Still further, as the event showed,
it opened the way for that campaign which, as many
critics think, resulted at Shiloh, or Pittsburg Landing,
in the strategically decisive action of the war.</p>
<p>However that may be, by the accomplishment of
his object in this campaign General Grant had
achieved one of the most conspicuous and to the country
one of the most enheartening victories that were
accomplished by any general on either side from the
beginning to the end of the war. He had every right
to expect commendation. He had every right to
expect permission to go on from conquest to

<pb id="VAC0885-284" n="278"/>

conquering, and to have such forces placed at his command
as might be necessary for the carrying out of
his enterprises. But Grant was still only an officer
of volunteers badly at outs with his department commander,
and those were the days of red tape, the days
in which achievement counted for nothing as against
"rank" and "seniority."</p>
<p>It is true that Halleck, who had never risen above
the grade of captain in the regular army, was at best
only Grant's equal in "old army rank." But he had
the favor of General Scott as Grant had not, and so,
ex-captain that he was, he had been made a major-
general in the regular service while Grant remained
a mere brigadier-general of volunteers. It is true that
Grant had captured two fortresses of enormous
strength while Halleck had captured nothing whatsoever
anywhere on earth. It is true that Grant had
received the surrender of a powerful and important
fort with fourteen thousand prisoners in addition to
a loss on the part of his enemy of two thousand in
killed and wounded, while Halleck had never received
the surrender of anybody and never did to the end of
the story. But Halleck was a major-general in the
regular army in spite of his resignation during his
captaincy--Grant also having been a captain when he
resigned--and so Halleck as department commander
was authorized not only to restrain Grant from this
expedition, as he had done during two months of
precious opportunity, but afterwards to suspend him
for many weeks from command, to place him under
virtual arrest and for weary weeks to restrain him
from carrying out those obviously easy supplementary

<pb id="VAC0885-285" n="279"/>
                    
enterprises with which he desired to glory-crown
his achievement. Grant wanted to march on Nashville,
which lay helpless before him and offered to the
Federals a strategic position of incalculable value.
Halleck ordered him to go to his tent and hammock
instead.</p>
<p>What a wretched story it all is, to be sure! What
a record of imbecility in control of genius, of incapacity
in command of the highest ability, of small
men in great places, and of great men restrained from
action by the superior authority of other men 
immeasurably their inferiors, who by luck, or circumstance
or official favor came into authority and position
which they in no wise deserved, and which they
were utterly incapable of using effectively in behalf
of the cause they were set to serve! And what a
price the country--North and South--was called
upon to pay in blood and treasure and heartbreak,
for all this misplacing of men!</p>
<p>But conditions and circumstances must be recognized,
    and due allowance must be made for them.
The officers in the regular United States army were
strictly professionals. Their first business in life was
to secure all they could of rank and pay for themselves.
Whether they remained in the regular army
or resigned to accept Confederate service, their first
concern was to secure all they could of personal preferment,
rank, distinction, and recognition. Why
should Beauregard or Johnston surrender aught of
their advantages of regularity in behalf of the genius
of Stonewall Jackson, who had long ago resigned to
become a professor in a military institute? Why


<pb id="VAC0885-286" n="280"/>

should McDowell, who had remained in the regular
army, give place to Sherman, who had resigned to
become a professor in a school? Why should Halleck,
who by General Scott's favor had been raised from
the rank of resigned captain to that of major-general,
give place or favor to the ex-Captain Grant, now by
mere popular selection a brigadier-general of volunteers,
holding no place whatsoever in the regular
army? Why should General Halleck permit this
interloper Grant to go on winning victories? And
why when the volunteer general had won them--as
for example at Pittsburg Landing--should not
Halleck come as he did and take command and thus
assume to himself the credit due to another?</p>
<p>These were the ways of the early war. Moreover
the administration on either side had no means of
measuring men's capacities except by army rank or
the favor of commanders. It was not until later that
better counsels prevailed, that demonstrated capacity
was recognized, and that the military martinet
learned that something more than seniority was required
as a claim to command.</p>
<p>Stonewall Jackson, it is true, had been made a
major-general in the Confederate service in reward
for his conduct at Manassas, but there were lieutenant-
generals and full generals still outranking him
and his was an exceptional case. Grant did not share
in the benefits of the example. He had won a great
victory which gave fresh heart and courage to the
country, but in his reports he had been careless of
technical details and had given no special credit for
his achievements to the department commander who

<pb id="VAC0885-287" n="281"/>
                    
had done all he could to prevent him from achieving
anything at all. He had made himself "<hi rend="i">persona non
grata</hi>" at department headquarters, though the people
everywhere were acclaiming him as a victor to the
sore annoyance of "headquarters." Why should
"headquarters" let the interloper complete his work by
seizing upon the vitally important positions which
his victory had made easy of conquest? Who was
Grant, anyhow? Ex-captain, ex-Galena clerk, and
only a brigadier-general of volunteers! What right
had he to the credit of any victories he had been 
graciously permitted to win?</p>

<p>During the autumn of 1861 the troops of both
sides were pushed into the "neutral" state of Kentucky
at various points and in considerable numbers.
Two battles of some moment resulted. At a place
called Paintville, on the Big Sandy river in the eastern
part of the state, Humphrey Marshall established
himself with about 2,000 or 2,500 Confederates.
Colonel Garfield (afterwards General and still
later President), in command of a substantially equal
force of Federals, assailed Marshall there, pushed
his columns back and on January 10, 1862, so far
crippled him in a small but hotly contested pitched
battle that Marshall was glad to retreat during the
night with a loss of morale which at that period of the
war was as important as the loss of guns.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the Confederate General Zollicoffer,
one of those amateurs in the military art
who managed by political or other interest to push
themselves into military command on either side, 
invaded eastern Kentucky, was defeated on October
21st, and fell back to Mill Springs on the upper waters
of the Cumberland, where he fortified himself.</p>
<p>General Don Carlos Buell on the Federal side was
in command of the department, and General George
H. Thomas was in command of the column that 
immediately confronted Zollicoffer.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-289" n="283"/>
                    
<p>General Thomas was a Virginian by birth and was
passionately devoted to his native state and its historic
memories. He had been at the outbreak of the
war a major in that specially selected regiment of
which Robert E. Lee was colonel and in which the
roster of his fellow officers included besides Lee
Albert Sydney Johnston, William J. Hardee, Earl
Van Dorn, E. Kirby Smith, John B. Hood and
Fitzhugh Lee. All of these, Thomas's fellow Southerners,
resigned their commissions and accepted service
in the Confederate army. Thomas, who had very
remarkably distinguished himself in the service, might
well have been strongly tempted, not only by the
example of these his beloved comrades and by his
sentimental affection for his native state, but additionally
by the direct certainty of an exalted command
in the Confederate army, to go with them into
the Southern service. To him peculiarly came the
perplexing problem of divided allegiance which presented
itself to every old army officer of Southern
birth, and it is said--whether truthfully or not the 
historian cannot determine--that for a time he seriously
anti painfully hesitated whether to cast in his lot with
Virginia and the South, and thus join his most
cherished comrades, or to retain his place in the service
of the nation that had educated him as a soldier and
that had so generously recognized and so richly rewarded
his genius and his devotion in the past. In
the end he decided to adhere to the Federal cause, and
very early in the war he was offered that supreme
command of the Federal armies which Robert E. Lee
had refused. He too declined that honor and 

<pb id="VAC0885-290" n="284"/>

responsibility, remaining, however, in the Federal service
and becoming one of the most brilliant commanders
in the Northern armies.</p>
<p>At Mill Springs with seven regiments, two batteries,
and a handful of cavalry, he assailed Zollicoffer--
who was killed in action--overthrew him and his successor
Crittenden, and in effect drove the Confederates
across the river. This was the first considerable
victory won by the Federal arms in any part of the
country after the Manassas defeat and its moral
effect was naturally very great. It antedated Grant's
victories, but was of course insignificant in comparison
with them.</p>
<p>In the meantime General Buell was busily organizing
the Army of the Ohio, with headquarters at
Louisville and very skilfully endeavoring to maneuver
the Confederates out of Kentucky without a
pitched battle, the results of which might have been
for better or for worse in the then undisciplined condition
of his troops. It was a period of the war in
which orderly battles were imminently perilous to the
Federal cause, because success in them would have
accomplished little while failure in them--which
might easily result from the rawness of the troops--
would have made of every border state a Confederate
possession and stronghold.</p>
<p>General Buell was afterwards bitterly censured
for not having fought great battles. It seems a
sounder judgment which awards him praise for having
maneuvered the Confederates out of Kentucky
and far into Tennessee, without risking all results
upon the hazard of any single contest which, with his
raw troops, he might or might not have won.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-291" n="285"/>

<p>But when Grant and Foote succeeded in capturing
Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, the situation was
fundamentally changed. There was a large and
rapidly increasing force at Louisville and near Bowling
Green under General Buell. Grant had his victorious
forces at the two strongholds of Fort Henry
and Fort Donelson. It was obviously easy and
obviously wise to move with the two armies upon
Nashville and add the conquest of all the Tennessee
strongholds to that already achieved of all positions
that could by any possibility give to the Confederates
a standing ground in Kentucky.</p>
<p>In brief Grant's idea was to employ all available
forces in the quick reduction of important Confederate
positions, the overthrow of all Confederate armed
forces, and the breaking of Confederate resisting
power before it could have time to strengthen itself
with reinforcements or with fortifications, or still
more important with the organization, disciplining
and seasoning of its troops. Accordingly he notified
General Halleck that he purposed to move at once
upon Nashville and positions beyond, unless forbidden
to do so.</p>
<p>He was promptly forbidden to do anything of the
kind, and peremptorily called back from a career of
easy and obvious victory. For who was this $800
Galena clerk ? What right had he to plan campaigns
and carry them to a success that reflected no credit
upon his regular army military superiors? It is
true that he had captured Forts Henry and Donelson,
with 14,623 men, 65 cannon, and 17,000 stands
of small arms, with ammunition and accouterments

<pb id="VAC0885-292" n="286"/>
                    
in proportion. It is true that he had made Federal
possessions of two important rivers reaching into the
heart of the Confederacy and commanding its most
important line of defense. It is true that he had
won the first great inspiriting success of the war for
the Federal arms. It is true that he had broken
that carefully constructed line of defense which the
Confederates had established from the Atlantic to
the Mississippi. It is true that he had placed the
National forces in such a position within the heart of
the Confederacy that a further and decisive advance
into Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi was obvious
and easy. But on the other hand he was only a volunteer,
possessing no rank or place in that regular army
group which, at the North and at the South alike,
stoutly asserted its claim to command by virtue of
regularity and seniority of commission and wholly
without regard to demonstrated genius or proved
capacity.</p>
<p>Grant's achievements in the capture of Forts
Henry and Donelson were so far recognized at
Washington that he was presently raised from the
rank of brigadier to that of major-general of <hi rend="i">volunteers</hi>.
But he was still denied even a junior second
lieutenant's place in the regular army, and in the
meantime an officer in the regular army was authorized
and entitled not only to order him to do
things--a small matter to a man disposed and accustomed
to do things--but to forbid him to do things--
a matter of much greater consequence to such a man.</p>
<p>General Halleck's official position was immeasurably
superior to that of Grant--at best a mere

<pb id="VAC0885-293" n="287"/>

major-general of volunteers--while his military
capacity was in an equal degree inferior to Grant's.
Grant habitually won battles. Halleck never did.
Grant conducted campaigns to success. Did Halleck?
It has already been shown for how long
Halleck restrained Grant from undertaking  his
expedition against Fort Henry and Fort Donelson.
When that campaign resulted in such a success as
had not before been anywhere achieved by the Federal
arms, Grant very naturally wanted to follow it up
in ways calculated speedily to break the Confederate
resistance, to occupy the commanding positions in the
Confederacy and to push Federal columns southward
through the seceding states, cutting them in twain
and making an end of their unity. It seemed to him
when Forts Henry and Donelson were in his possession
quite a matter of course that he should move
with his 27,000 men upon Nashville and other strategic
points further south, and that all available
forces, including Buell's strong and steadily increasing
army, should be ordered to join him and assist
him in the execution of this enterprise before the
Confederates could organize effective resistance. In
brief it seemed to Grant, simple soldier that he was,
that the purpose of the organization of the Federal
forces was to win the war as quickly as possible and
with the smallest possible sacrifice of life and treasure.
The shortest road to that end was to follow up
his victory by the capture of other Confederate positions,
the conquest of which was then easy and the
possession of which seemed to promise that result.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Accordingly General Grant was censured for his
unauthorized advance upon Nashville, and instead of
proceeding against Confederate strongholds further
South which were easily within his vigorous and resolute
grasp, was peremptorily ordered to return to the
forts which he had captured with such splendor of
success and there to sit still till released from what
amounted to arrest.</p>
<p>It was the story of Manassas over again, except
that it was reversed in its application. As after
Manassas Washington lay an easy prey to the Confederates,
which by reason of incapacity they did not
grasp, so, and in like measure, the central strongholds
of the Confederacy lay, after the capture of Forts

<pb id="VAC0885-295" n="289"/>

Henry and Donelson, within the easy grasp of
Grant's army. The only difference was that in the
one case it was the inexperience of the general in the
field that forbade, while in the other it was the paralyzing
prohibition of the general in a secure headquarters
that stood in the way of achievement.</p>
<p>In the one case it was the predestined men of action
who faltered and failed of their opportunity. In the
other the man of action was restrained by "orders"
which he dared not disobey.</p>
<p>Thus by the paralysis of Halleck's official hand,
Grant was restrained from pushing the war to results
--possibly even to a conclusion--prompt, certain and
immediate.</p>
<p>General Halleck, who never in all his life commanded
an army in battle, was by the pure unreason
of military law and etiquette officially authorized to
restrain the military impulse of Grant toward manifestly
right ends.</p>
<p>Grant had neglected, or was accused of having
neglected, some technical formality as to details in
making his report of the actions which had made him
master of the forts. To ordinary common-sense it
would seem that the only important facts which he
was called upon to report on that occasion were that
he had certain forces under his command; that after
three days of hard fighting in rain and sleet and
indescribable mud his enemy had surrendered the
forts with 14,623 men, 65 pieces of artillery and
17,000 stands of small arms; that he had made himself
master of the two strongholds and now completely
commanded both rivers, having thus opened

<pb id="VAC0885-296" n="290"/>

a double river route into the heart of the Southern
Confederacy, which he proposed to make still further
available by an immediate advance upon Nashville
and other strategic points the possession of which
would give him an open pathway to the Gulf itself.</p>
<p>This was all that common-sense required Grant to
report for the information of his superiors, and he
reported precisely that. But those office-housed
superiors held him guilty of neglect in that he had not
given in detail the position of every regiment and
brigade and battery that had helped to win the victory.
In punishment of this neglect of infinitely
petty detail--and also in emphasis of the fact that
Grant was after all only a general of volunteers who
had presumed to win unauthorized victories in no way
assigned to him to win--Grant was called back from
his advance for the conquest of those strategic points
that lay so easily within his grasp and ordered instead
to remain where he was and to let slip from his hands
the ripe fruits of his victory.</p>
<p>Was there ever anything so absurd as this, outside
of comic opera--this and the extraordinary reign of
incapacity in the Confederate army and Government?
That was of like kind and quality.</p>
<p>The simple fact, of which the historian is obliged
to take account, is that if ordinary common-sense and
the commonest forms of military sagacity had been
in control on either side at the beginning of the war--
if the men able to do things had been permitted to do
them--the struggle must almost certainly have ended
within a few months after its beginning; tens, yes,
scores and hundreds of thousands of lives must have

<pb id="VAC0885-297" n="291"/>

been spared and multitudes of millions in expenditure
and in the destruction of property would have
been saved to the American people.</p>
<p>That however was not to be. It was written in
the Book of Fate that for a time incapacity, self-
seeking, narrow-minded, jealousy of rank, and other
like forces of the coarse and the commonplace were
to rule about equally on the one side and on the other,
and that thus the war was to be prolonged at terrible
cost of sorrow and suffering and slaughter.</p>
<p>This was the situation in the West at the time when
McClellan was drilling his men around Washington,
while Beauregard and Johnston were futilely fortifying
at Centreville to meet an assault that only the
writer of nonsense rhymes could at that time have
regarded as possible, and the victorious Federal
forces on the Carolina coasts were succumbing to the
lassitude which that climate invites, making no vigorous
efforts to conquer the exposed and indefensible
Confederate lines of communication in that quarter.</p>
<p>Grant had a force of commanding numbers in the
neighborhood of Forts Henry and Donelson. His
army had been swelled to 27,000 men. Buell had as
many more men--some of them battle-seasoned--at
Louisville and south of that city. There were other
forces in eastern Kentucky under capable commanders,
which could easily have been brought to bear,
forming an army of more than 100,000 men in support
of any southward movement that might be
undertaken. The movement which naturally suggested
itself to an aggressive military mind was one
against Nashville, with an eye to the penetration of


<pb id="VAC0885-298" n="292"/>

the South from that point as a base of supplies. The
"march to the sea" was as easy a possibility then as
when Sherman made it years later.</p>
<p>This was Grant's idea, and it had behind it the
eminent common-sense which usually inspired and
informed that very practical general's plans. His
purpose was to march with an overwhelming force,
from Nashville to the Gulf. He could have done
this easily and certainly, had he been permitted to
undertake it with the forces then available. But, as
we have seen, his purpose was brought to naught by
the veto of General Halleck, whose notion of strategy
seems to have been to let his enemy determine where
and when the fighting should occur.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Southerners, seeing the strategic
situation far more clearly than Halleck did, abandoned
Nashville and Federal troops of Buell's army
promptly occupied that city. Thus Grant's success
was saved to the country in some small and insignificant
measure, though Grant was himself suspended
from command and compelled to wait in inglorious
ease until the Confederates by ceaseless and heroic
efforts got together a great army in northern Mississippi,
to meet which General Halleck found it necessary
to call upon his most capable lieutenant, Ulysses
S. Grant.</p>

<p>It is necessary now to record what had meanwhile
been going on in Virginia and elsewhere. At
the beginning of November General George B.
McClellan was placed in supreme command subject
only to the President--of all the armies of the United
States.  He was called "the young Napoleon,"
though upon what grounds of achievement that characterization
was based it is difficult to conjecture.
He was thirty-five years of age, and therefore young.
He was a West Point graduate and an accomplished
officer of engineers. He had been sent during the
Crimean war to observe and report upon the organization
and conduct of European armies. He had
made a report admirable in its literary quality and
expert in its observations. Later he had won distinction
by his very capable conduct of that campaign
in western Virginia which resulted in the division of
the "pivotal" border state, and the arraying of its
western half upon the Federal side. But neither in
his deeds nor in the temper of his mind was there
aught that could with propriety be called Napoleonic.
He was given from first to last, as will appear hereafter,
to the temperamental fault of exaggerating his
enemy's strength and to a shrinking from conflict
with a foe whose forces he thus overestimated.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-300" n="294"/>                   
                    
<p>Nevertheless, when McClellan was appointed to
the supreme command of the Union armies after his
months of organizing at Washington it was expected
of him that he should at once advance upon Richmond
and dictate terms of surrender in the Confederate
capital itself.</p>
<p>He had found around Washington in the summer
a state of affairs which must have hopelessly discouraged
any commanding officer not altogether given
over to optimism. It sadly discouraged McClellan.
In words of his own he found at Washington "no
army to command-a mere collection of regiments
cowering on the banks of the Potomac, some perfectly
raw, others dispirited by recent defeat, some
going home. There were," he added, "no defensive
works on the southern approaches to the capital.
Washington," he officially reported, "was crowded
with straggling officers and men absent from their
stations without authority." Is there any wonder that
McClellan found it necessary to devote many months
to the task of creating an effective army out of such
stuff as this? Is there any escape from wonder that
with the national capital thus hopelessly undefended,
Beauregard and Johnston failed to advance upon and
capture it?</p>
<p>This matter has been discussed in sufficient detail
already in these pages. But it is worthy of note that
the Confederate commanders who so strangely neglected
their opportunities after the battle of Manassas,
were not restrained by higher authority from
the activity that was so obviously called for by the
circumstances of the case, as Grant was after Donelson.

<pb id="VAC0885-301" n="295"/>

They were free to act upon their own initiative,
and had they been at that time, as they afterwards
became, generals of fair military capacity they would
have acted with vigor and promptitude and the future
history of the war would very certainly have been
quite other than it was.</p>
<p>The chief hope of the Confederates lay in the
recognition of their independence by foreign governments
and in a presumably probable alliance between
themselves and the powerful nations of
Europe. To promote that result they sent out two
duly accredited ministers, the one to Great Britain
and the other to France. The men selected for this
service were James M. Mason of Virginia and John
Slidell of Louisiana.</p>
<p>These envoys escaped through the blockade to
Havana. There they embarked on the British mail
steamer <hi rend="i">Trent</hi>. Captain Charles Wilkes, commanding
the United States steam frigate <hi rend="i">San Jacinto</hi>,
overhauled the <hi rend="i">Trent</hi> at sea, on November eight, and
made prisoners of Mason and Slidell and their
secretaries.</p>
<p>There is no doubt now that the act of Captain
Wilkes was utterly lawless. But there is equally no
doubt that it was dictated by a patriotic purpose. It
was instantly and enthusiastically applauded throughout
the North, and the Federal Congress, inattentive
to international law or consequences, voted thanks to
Wilkes for his conduct in the matter. However, there
was the offended British government still to be reckoned
with, and that government was at that time not
very reluctant to pick a quarrel with the United

<pb id="VAC0885-302" n="296"/>

States or to find a substantial excuse for recognizing
Southern independence, and perhaps lending aid to
the Southern arms.</p>
<p>The act of Captain Wilkes was denounced by the
British Government, as an outrage upon British neutrality
and a wanton trespass upon British sovereignty
as represented by the Union Jack afloat over
a British mail steamer. A demand was promptly
made for the surrender of Mason and Slidell, and
for an apology. There is no possible room for doubt
that that demand was justified under the laws of
nations and peculiarly so by the precedents of American
contention, for it was in protest against precisely
such sea seizures that this country had made war in
1812. But the people of the North were tremendously
excited over an incident in which they greatly 
rejoiced, and it was in an extreme degree dangerous
for the administration to contravene popular sentiment
and to undo Captain Wilkes's work, by yielding
to Britain's demands for the surrender of Mason and
Slidell.</p>
<p>From beginning to end of the war there was perhaps
no problem so perplexing as that which this
controversy presented to Mr. Lincoln's administration
to solve. To refuse Britain's demands was to
invite instant war with the greatest naval power in
the world, with the certainty that France, already
eager, would join forces with Great Britain in recognizing
the Southern Confederacy and supporting it
in its assertion of independence. In that case all that
the United States had done toward the establishment
of a blockade of Southern ports would have been

<pb id="VAC0885-303" n="297"/>

quickly undone by the appearance of overmastering
British and French fleets on the Southern coasts, and
very probably by the landing of British and French
forces to aid the Confederates in their war against
the Union. For when war is on nations do not stop
at technical interference. They are apt to furnish
men and guns in aid of the cause they have espoused.
In any case a declaration of war between Great
Britain and the United States--a declaration of war
which the capture of Mason and Slidell very narrowly
threatened--would have resulted in the raising of the
blockade of every Southern port and the opening of
the South to that free traffic in arms, ammunition and
supplies which chiefly the South needed in order to
accomplish its purposes.</p>
<p>Should the Government, on the other hand, yield
to the British demand, it must encounter that highly
inflamed popular sentiment which had compelled a
congressional resolution of thanks to Captain Wilkes,
and which--sanely or insanely--was disposed to
twiddle its fingers at British or any other intervention
in American affairs.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward, as Secretary of State, solved the
matter by one of the most adroit diplomatic quibbles
ever invented by an ingenious mind. He must surrender
Mason and Slidell of course, otherwise war
was on with England and France, the blockade was
broken, the Confederacy was recognized and the
establishment of a Southern Republic was an accomplished
fact. On the other hand Mr. Seward must
not without good and sufficient excuse yield one jot
or tittle to English demands--even though those 

<pb id="VAC0885-304" n="298"/>

demands were supported by American precedents--lest
he offend the "whip all creation" sentiment of the
country.</p>
<p>Probably in all history no diplomat ever managed
so delicate or so difficult a matter so skilfully as Mr.
Seward did this. He carefully set forth the war
rights of his country. He contended that Captain
Wilkes had a right to capture the <hi rend="i">Trent</hi> as a vessel
knowingly carrying contraband of war. But he explained
that, as Captain Wilkes had released the vessel
instead of bringing her into port as a prize, he had
lost his rights and forfeited his claims. In summing
up Mr. Seward said: "If I declare this case in favor
of my own Government I must disavow its most
cherished principles and reverse and forever abandon
its most essential policy. We are asked to do to the
British nation just what we have insisted all nations
ought to do to us."</p>
<p>Mr. Seward's plea was a specious one, but it answered
its purpose. It enabled him to avoid war with
Great Britain and France without alienating from
the administration the support of that sentiment of
confident self-reliance in the country upon which
enlistments and the success of the war depended.
He surrendered Mason and Slidell, but he adroitly
managed to represent his action rather as a new assertion
of the old 1812 doctrine of American rights than
as in any sense a surrender to a foreign nation's demand.
Thus peace abroad was secured and popular
sentiment at home was appeased; and after all the
temporary detention of the two Confederate ministers
had fully accomplished its purpose. By the time

<pb id="VAC0885-305" n="299"/>

that they reached Europe official and public opinion
in that quarter had so far changed that neither
France nor England was any longer disposed to
recognize the independent nationality of the Confederacy
which had so conspicuously neglected its easy
opportunity to' compel recognition by an advance
upon Washington after Manassas.</p>
<p>One other event of importance remains to be
recorded in this chapter. When the Confederates
seized upon the Navy Yard at Portsmouth, opposite
Norfolk, Virginia, the Federal forces there destroyed
all they could of valuable materials and adjuncts of
war. But there was left a ship, the <hi rend="i">Merrimac</hi>, burned
in part and sunk. The Confederates raised this ship,
cut her down and armored her with railroad iron.
She was the first iron-clad ship that ever assailed other
ships, the pioneer of all modern naval armaments. At
the same time Captain John Ericsson at the North
was experimenting upon somewhat similar lines and
producing the <hi rend="i">Monitor</hi>, the first iron-clad, turreted
ship ever built.</p>
<p>On the eighth of March the Confederate iron-clad
ram the <hi rend="i">Merrimac</hi>--or the <hi rend="i">Virginia</hi> as the Confederates
had newly named her--steamed out into Hampton
Roads and promptly destroyed two United States
ships of war, the <hi rend="i">Congress</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Cumberland</hi>.
Her performance created the greatest consternation.
It was obvious that no wooden ship could live in conflict
with such a craft as this. With such guns as
were then in use her sides were impenetrable by shot
or shell. With her steel nose it was easily possible
for her to ram and sink any ship of any type then in
use without danger to herself.</p>
                    
<pb id="VAC0885-306" n="300"/>

<p>It was the plan of the Confederates to have this
ironclad  destroy  the wooden   fleet in  Hampton
Roads, as it was obviously and easily possible for it to
do, proceed at once to New York and work havoc
there, and then steam south to raise the blockade by
sinking, one after another, the wooden ships of the
blockading fleet.</p>
<p>But just after the <hi rend="i">Virginia's</hi> first success was
achieved, there steamed into Hampton Roads Captain
Ericsson's iron-clad, turreted ship, the <hi rend="i">Monitor</hi>.
The next day these two armored vessels tried conclusions
with each other. At the end of the fight the <hi rend="i">Virginia</hi>
retired to Portsmouth damaged and discredited.
The <hi rend="i">Monitor</hi> had proved to be more than her match,
and while it had not succeeded in destroying her it
had demonstrated its own superiority as a marine
fighting machine.</p>
<p>More important still was the fact that while the
South had no shipyards in which new and improved
<hi rend="i">Virginias</hi> could be built, the North was abundantly
able to reproduce the <hi rend="i">Monitor</hi> in other ships of like
kind without number or limit and to better her type
and construction in the light of experience.</p>
<p>This conflict is historically interesting as the birth
scene of modern naval armaments. It was the first
direct conflict of armored ships. It was the first instance
in history in which ironclad met ironclad. It
marked the dawn of a new era in naval construction,
the natal day of all modern navies. It was the beginning
from which have sprung the battleship, the
armored cruiser, the protected cruiser, the gunboat
and the torpedo-boat destroyer, as we know them now.

<pb id="VAC0885-307" n="301"/>
                    
The fight between the Southern ironclad and the
ships it destroyed, and the contest next day between
it and the <hi rend="i">Monitor</hi>, have been widely celebrated in
song and story. But the real significance of those
contests lies rather in that to which they gave birth
than in that which in themselves they were.</p>

<head rend="center sc">S<hi rend="sc">HILOH</hi></head>
                                        
<p>McClellan's advance upon Richmond, in its beginnings
    at least, antedated the great conflict at Shiloh.
But its crisis did not come until much later, nor did
it in its early progress involve aught that was of significance
in its bearing upon the conduct and outcome
of the war.</p>
<p>It seems proper therefore to discuss Shiloh and
other operations in the Mississippi Valley first, leaving
the campaign in Virginia for later consideration.</p>
<p>The Confederates, before the fall of Fort Donelson
and Fort Henry, were maintaining a line of
offensive defense in Kentucky. This line extended
from the Big Sandy in the eastern part of the state
to Columbus on the Mississippi river in the extreme
west.</p>
<p>The line was in many respects defective. The
Confederate center of operations was at Bowling
Green, while the two ends of the defensive line lay
much farther north than that. The line thus constituted
what in military parlance is known as a reentering
angle. The enemy pushing into such an angle
with forces greater than those that defended it or
even with an inferior force, had easy choice to attack
on either side as he pleased, concentrating at will,
while compelling the Confederates to scatter their

<pb id="VAC0885-309" n="303"/>
                    
forces along the whole of an extensive line by way of
defending all parts of it equally.</p>
<p>It was the original purpose of those who devised
this defensive system to correct the fault by pushing
their center forward from Bowling Green to Paducah
on the Ohio river, nearly fifty miles above the mouth
of that stream. Had this been accomplished, it would
have made the angle of defense a salient instead of
a reëntering one.</p>
<p>Let us explain the advantage of this for the benefit
of the non-military reader. If the Confederates
could have established themselves at Paducah with
their lines trending off to the southeast on the one
side and to the southwest on the other, they, instead
of their enemies, would have had choice of positions
in which to concentrate. Assailed at any point it
would have been easy for them to throw all possible
force quickly to the defense of the threatened position.</p>
<p>Grant interfered with all this planning when he
moved up the Ohio, and seized upon Paducah, which
was quickly fortified so strongly as to render the
execution of the scheme thereafter impracticable.
From that time forward it was clear that the Confederates
must either maintain their line of defense
by means of a vast and dangerously unmanageable
reëntering angle, or they must withdraw from their
two advanced wing points. To do this latter thing
would have been to abandon Kentucky completely,
and it was no part of the Confederate program to
do that.</p>
<p>A second defect in this scheme of defense was that
the line thus formed was traversed by two rivers, the

<pb id="VAC0885-310" n="304"/>
                    
Tennessee and the Cumberland, both practically
navigable by steamboats. It was obvious to ordinary
common-sense that should both or either of these
rivers at any time fall under control of the enemy,
with his multitudinous gunboats and other river craft
which could easily be made to carry guns, the western
half of the Confederate force must be completely
and at once cut off from all but a very roundabout
and slow communication with its allies on the east.</p>
<p>Here was a danger which must have presented
itself obtrusively to the minds of those who formed
and ordered this military arrangement. It is difficult
for a military critic in this later day to understand
or to conceive upon what principle of scientific warfare
such a line was accepted as even tolerably judicious.
Its adoption seems in fact to have been
determined more by political than by military considerations.</p>
<p>In order to meet the difficulty the Confederates
created the two great fortresses--Henry and Donelson
--to defend the rivers. These forts were curiously
misplaced. They were located one upon the
one river, and the other upon the other, at a point near
the dividing line between Kentucky and Tennessee.
At that point the two rivers run within eleven miles
of each other. But a little farther down the streams
--that is to say a little farther north--their course
brings them within three miles of each other. Here
obviously on all accounts was the point at which the
defensive works should have been constructed. In
that case the two forts would have been within easy
supporting distance of each other and neither could

<pb id="VAC0885-311" n="305"/>

have been assailed from the rear. Moreover, we have
the authority of no less eminent an engineer than
General Beauregard for saying that the ground at
this point is well fitted by its natural conformation
for purposes of defense, while at the point actually
selected for the two fortresses it is peculiarly
lacking in that advantage. But the more defensible
position was in Kentucky and purely political considerations
had weight in determining the choice of
the less advantageous point of defense in Tennessee.</p>
<p>The defective character of this line of defense and
the mistake underlying its acceptance were strongly
emphasized after the overthrow of Zollicoffer at Mill
Springs and the pushing forward of General
Thomas's forces to more southerly points. This
movement placed a threatening force on the right
flank of the Confederate line of defense. Nevertheless,
the Confederate War Department clung to its
mistaken policy. It lived at that time in a fool's paradise
in which facts counted for little in comparison
with theories, and in which optimism was expected to
serve the purpose of guns and brigades and defensive
works.</p>
<p>When at the end of January, 1862, the War Department
asked General Beauregard to go to that
region as second in command under General Albert
Sydney Johnston, it confidently assured him that the
troops under General Johnston's command exceeded
seventy thousand in number. On his arrival there
General Beauregard found that in fact these widely
and dangerously scattered forces numbered less than
forty-five thousand and that the several parts could

<pb id="VAC0885-312" n="306"/>
                    
not possibly be made to support each other. He found
also that the strength in fortification, in guns and in
men, which should have been concentrated mainly in
Forts Henry and Donelson, had been largely wasted
at Columbus, a position naturally indefensible or defensible
by a small as easily as by a large force. He
found that vast quantities of precious stores had been
warehoused there in face of the fact that Columbus
was the most northerly and the most exposed point
on the entire defensive line.</p>
<p>When General Beauregard joined General Johnston
and made his study of conditions, he pointed out
all these defects in the line and all the dangers they
involved. General Beauregard had, since the battle
of Manassas, developed an aggressive tendency
which he had strangely lacked in the earlier months of
his career as a general. He had grown into a real
general. He therefore proposed to General Johnston
an instant offensive movement.</p>
<p>Here it is important for the reader clearly to understand
the situation.</p>
<p>General Polk, commanding the Confederates at
Columbus, was threatened by a superior force under
General Pope in Missouri, on the other side of the
river. General Johnston's position at Bowling Green
was threatened by a distinctly superior army under
General Buell which lay scarcely more than a two
days' march to the north and east. Moreover the
position of Bowling Green was already in effect
turned by Thomas's advance from eastern Kentucky
towards eastern Tennessee. In the meanwhile General
Grant, supported by the gunboats, was in 


<pb id="VAC0885-313" n="307"/>
                    
possession of Paducah and threatening to advance with
15,000 men for the reduction of Fort Henry and
Fort Donelson.</p>
<p>The Confederate forces were scattered beyond all
possibility of effective cooperation except by a concentration
in advance involving a radical change in
the scheme and line of defense. There were at that
time about 14,000 Confederate effectives at Bowling
Green; about 5,500 at Forts Henry and Donelson;
about 8,000 near Clarksville; and about 15,000 at and
near Columbus. Other detached forces at various
points swelled the total of the Confederate forces in
Kentucky and Tennessee to about 45,000 fighting
men.</p>
<p>Grant was threatening the river forts with 15,000
men. Pope had 30,000 men or more in southeast
Missouri, threatening Columbus. Buell had a large
and rapidly increasing  army, numbering from
40,000 to 60,000 men (overestimated by Beauregard
at 75,000 or 80,000) at Bacon's Creek, within striking
distance, forty miles, of Bowling Green.
It was obviously easy for Pope to occupy Polk at
Columbus and for Buell to engage Johnston at
Bowling Green with an overwhelming force, while
Grant should advance to the assault of Forts Henry
and Donelson.</p>
<p>Buell, with his army of 40,000 or 50,000 men,
might easily have overwhelmed Johnston's 14,000
at Bowling Green. Pope could have so far engaged
Polk at Columbus as to prevent the detachment even
of a squad from that quarter for Johnston's reinforcement.
Grant in the meanwhile could make his

<pb id="VAC0885-314" n="308"/>

advance with 15,000 men--to be reinforced presently
to 27,000--and the gunboats, against Forts Henry
and Donelson, defended as those works were by no
more than 5,500 men.</p>
<p>It was Beauregard's urgent advice to withdraw all
but garrison forces from Columbus, Bowling Green
and Clarksville, and to concentrate an overmastering
force for resistance to Grant in front of Fort
Donelson.</p>
<p>This plan was in some degree acted upon. That
is to say enough men were concentrated at the forts
to swell the record of Grant's subsequent capture to
about 15,01)00 men, but not enough to defend the position.
The plan might have failed had an attempt
been made to execute it in its full scope. Attempted
by half measures as it was its failure was clearly fore-
ordained. Grant captured the forts and their defending
garrisons and made himself master of the
two rivers which, next to the Mississippi, were of most
vital importance to both sides. After the forts had
fallen the occupation of Nashville was quite a matter
of course, and equally so was the necessity of the
Confederate evacuation of Kentucky and of practically
all of Tennessee.</p>
<p>Presently after being "kept in" by Halleck Grant
was restored to command--though still as a mere
volunteer officer under censure and still subject to
General Halleck's often paralyzing  domination.
Grant instantly began, after his habit, to plan a further
campaign of damage to the enemies of the
Union. One opportunity had been denied to him.
He sought another.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-315" n="309"/>
                    
<p>In the meanwhile his capture of Forts Henry and
Donelson had split the Confederate line of defense
in two and rendered its further maintenance an
utter impossibility. With the Tennessee and Cumberland
rivers in Federal possession it was manifestly
absurd to think of maintaining a line of defense
which those rivers traversed. The success of Grant
had completely ended all possibility of cooperation
between the eastern and western wings of that defensive
line. The forces west of the Tennessee and
those east of that river must henceforth act independently
and rather hopelessly, or else they must
retire to a new line farther south upon which cooperation
might be possible.</p>
<p>It was decided to retire. Bowling Green was
evacuated and the Federal General Buell instantly
occupied it. A little later Nashville was evacuated
by the Confederates in behalf of a less exposed position.
It was at the same time determined to withdraw
from Columbus all the forces assembled there
except a garrison sufficient to work the guns, and to
defend the point for a time with the aid of Commodore
Hollins's gunboats in the Mississippi.</p>
<p>The new line of defense adopted by the Confederates
was the Memphis and Charleston railroad,
running through southern Tennessee and northern
Mississippi, Alabama, etc. This line presented no
natural advantages of defense, but it covered the
most vitally important railroad communications of
the Confederacy. Furthermore it will be observed
that this line of defense lies almost exactly midway
between the Ohio River and the Gulf of Mexico.

<pb id="VAC0885-316" n="310"/>

In other words, under Grant's energetic aggressiveness,
the Federal control had been pushed from
the Ohio river nearly half way to the gulf. The
process of "splitting the Confederacy in two,"
was already well advanced at the beginning of the
spring of 1862.</p>
<p>It was always the keynote of Grant's policy to
"press things," and after his period of suspension
from command he began again to carry out that
obviously wise policy.</p>
<p>As the dominant thought in General Grant's
strategy from beginning to end of the war, he was
strongly impressed with the fact that the North was
vastly superior to the South in all military resources,
and as a man of practical common sense it was his
idea that this superiority in men, arms, ammunition,
food supplies, and all else that tends to help military
endeavor should be insistently and persistently
utilized in the breaking of Confederate resistance
within  the briefest possible time. The ancient
thought of divine arbitrament in arms had no place
in his mind. The notion was incredible to him that
two armies should stand still and do nothing while
a David on the one side and a Goliath on the other
should make a personal trial of conclusions. He was
not lacking in chivalry or sentiment, as abundantly
appeared on several conspicuous occasions, but he had
besides an all-dominating common sense, and he used
it. He fully agreed with the Confederate General
Forrest in his definition of strategy as the art of
"getting there first with the most men." He did not
understand modern warfare to be in any wise akin to

<pb id="VAC0885-317" n="311"/>
                    
a medieval tournament in which equality of opportunity
must be sought at all costs. Quite on the contrary
he regarded war as a perfectly practical matter of
business, to be carried on as such. He clearly saw it
to be what it is and always must be, a cruel survival
from barbaric times, a measuring of brute strength
in that last appeal of humanity, to the arbitrament of
arms.</p>
<p>His common sense taught him that whatever of
science there might be involved in the conduct of war,
its results depended after all upon brute force. It
was therefore his plan always to bring to bear all that
he possessed of brute force for the solution of the
problems at issue, and, wherever he could, to press his
adversary with heavier battalions than that adversary
could muster.</p>
<p>Having been set free again with permission to
resume active warfare, Grant intuitively desired to
push forward, pressing his adversary at every point,
seizing upon every assailable position and making
himself master of every place from which further
war could be waged with hope of success.</p>
<p>As we have seen, he had been called back from this
program of common sense after his capture of Forts
Henry and Donelson, and until March 13 he was not
again allowed to do anything whatever or to use his
abilities in any manner in the public service.</p>
<p>By making himself master of the two rivers he
had completely destroyed the Confederate line and
scheme of defense. He had completely cut off that
part of the Confederate force which had its headquarters
at Bowling Green from that part of it whose

<pb id="VAC0885-318" n="312"/>
                    
chief seat was at Columbus. So complete was this
severance, as a glance at a map will show, that
General Albert Sydney Johnston sent General Beauregard
at once to command the western force as a
separate army with specific instructions to act upon
his own judgment, bearing in mind that cooperation
between the two forces was no longer possible.</p>
<p>It was surely a great strategic victory for Grant
thus to break an elaborate line of defense and thus
completely to divide an army already inferior to the
armies opposing it in numbers, resources and equipments.
But this was not all of it. By this division
of the Confederate forces Grant was left free to
attack either half of the Southern army at will, with
overwhelming numbers--for in addition to his own
38,000 men--for his force had been swelled to that
strength--he had Buell's much larger force within
easy call, to say nothing of Thomas's command, now
foot-loose for aggressive campaigning. It is safe to
say that had Grant been permitted, he could and
would have fallen upon and crushed the Confederates
under Johnston, with an absolutely overwhelming
army. He could and would have conquered
every remaining Confederate stronghold in Tennessee
and northern Georgia and Alabama and he could
and probably would have made within the first year
of the war that "march to the sea," either at Mobile
or at Savannah, which was left for Sherman to make
years later.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with a strong detachment he
could easily have destroyed the long and exceedingly
vulnerable line of communication that connected
Columbus, Kentucky, with the South.</p>


<pb id="VAC0885-319" n="313"/>
                    
<p>At Jackson, Tennessee, the Mississippi Central
railroad coming up from New Orleans and the Mobile
and Ohio line running north from Mobile
formed a junction. From that point north to Columbus,
there was but one fragile line of single track,
earth-ballasted railroad, serving as a connecting link
between the South and its excessively advanced western
position at Columbus. It is difficult to imagine
a line of military communication more vulnerable
than this little thread. The country between
the Tennessee river and this railroad line was quite
open and there was neither fortress nor force, except
here and there an easily conquerable picket
post to defend the communication. If Grant had
been left with a free hand there is no doubt whatever
that he would instantly have sent westward a force
too small in itself for its detachment to weaken him,
but large enough to make itself instantly and completely
master of this railroad line. He would thus
have cut off all communication between Columbus
and the South. He would have made himself quickly
master of all the forces and all the supplies and all the
ordnance that had been foolishly concentrated at
Columbus. He would without a battle have compelled
the surrender of that stronghold, with all its
preposterously numerous garrison, with all its great
guns, and with all of the rich store of supplies and
ammunition and other war material collected there.</p>
<p>It was another absurdity of the early war that
Grant was forbidden to do any of these things, when
the time for their doing was ripe. By orders of his
"superior officer" Halleck, Grant was held idle at the

<pb id="VAC0885-320" n="314"/>

forts that he had conquered while this opportunity
slipped away. From the sixteenth of February to
the thirteenth of March this only general who knew
how to do things and how to get things done was condemned
to idleness and inaction by the absurd order
of a distinctly unfriendly martinet.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Confederates, not being fools,
utilized the opportunity given them by this delay, to
rescue themselves from their peculiarly perilous position.
Johnston withdrew the eastern half of the
Confederate army from Bowling Green to the line
of the railroad that led from Memphis eastward.
Beauregard, in command of the western half of the
army which Grant had so completely sundered, clearly
saw the situation and promptly retired his forces from
Columbus to Corinth, Mississippi, on the line of the
Memphis and Charleston railroad at its intersection
of the Mobile and Ohio line. He had in the meantime
transferred to New Madrid on the Mississippi,
and to Island Number 10 in that stream, the best of
the ordnance in Columbus, thus providing as effectually
as he could for the defense of the great river
and for its blockading against Federal gunboats and
still more important Federal transports bearing
troops and supplies to points below.</p>                    
<p>Corinth is a little village in the extreme north of
Mississippi. It has no pronounced defensive advantages
whatsoever. It lies in a region of nearly flat
lands with no line of bold hills to protect it and no
difficult stream to serve as a base of defense. But it
lies upon that line of railroad which the Confederates
must defend if they were to preserve their communications

<pb id="VAC0885-321" n="315"/>

between the east and the west at the crossing
of the north and south line.</p>
<p>At Corinth the Confederates concentrated all their
forces. Against Corinth Grant instantly directed
his operations as soon as he was restored to command
and permitted by his superior officer to carry on the
war for his country upon lines marked out by common
-sense.</p>
<p>He moved at once to Pittsburg Landing on the
Tennessee river. Pittsburg Landing lies about
twenty miles north by east of Corinth and between
the two there is no considerable stream, no important
range of hills, nothing in the shape of physical conformation
of the ground that could aid Confederate
defense or facilitate Confederate aggression. On the
contrary the streams near Pittsburg ministered exclusively
to Federal purposes.</p>
<p>When Grant arrived at Pittsburg Landing he
found the army encamped about equally upon the
eastern and western sides of the river. He instantly
and boldly ordered the whole of it to the western or
Confederate bank of the stream.</p>
<p>This was a very daring thing to do. For with the
Tennessee river behind him and with no means of
easily crossing it in retreat, Grant must face the certain
surrender of his army in case of an unsuccessful
battle in that position. In such an event there could
be no alternative. But it was not Grant's habit of
mind to look for alternatives. He boldly took the
risk as it was his custom to do. He threw his whole
army across the river and there waited for the arrival
of Buell's stronger force, which had been ordered by

<pb id="VAC0885-322" n="316"/>

Halleck to join him and was marching in very
leisurely fashion to do so. The army under Grant's
own immediate command numbered now about
38,000 men, increased almost immediately to 45,000.
That under Buell which was strolling westward to
reinforce him numbered more than 40,000. He thus
had prospect of an overwhelming force with which to
assail the Confederates at Corinth, where under Beauregard's
tireless activity they had succeeded in concentrating
about 45,000 or 50,000 men, a large part of
this force consisting of raw recruits unorganized,
undrilled, undisciplined and extremely ill armed.</p>
<p>Whether Halleck planned this concentration of
Grant's and Buell's armies for an advance upon
Corinth as his partisans contend, or whether Grant
planned it and Halleck merely accepted the plan as
others stoutly assert, is a matter of no historical consequence,
whatever biographical interest it may have.
In either case the purpose of the concentration was
to move upon Corinth in irresistible force, overthrow
the Confederates there and seize upon the two important
lines of railroad which intersect each other at
that point. It was at any rate Halleck's purpose to
command in this campaign in person. But it was not
intended to advance upon Corinth until Grant's and
Buell's armies should form a junction, and there was
no thought or expectation that the Confederates
would themselves assume the offensive. General
Halleck planned to leave St. Louis not earlier than
April 7, and perhaps several days later, for Pittsburg
Landing. In the meanwhile General Grant had
posted his army loosely and had thrown up no earthworks

<pb id="VAC0885-323" n="317"/>

works in the field. All his procedures indicated that
he did not expect to be molested where he lay or to
encounter the enemy until he should go in search of
him. Indeed, he telegraphed Halleck on the fifth of
April, the very day before the battle, saying, "The
main force of the enemy is at Corinth, with troops at
different points east. . .  I have scarcely the faintest
idea of an attack (general one) being made upon
us, but will be prepared should such a thing take
place."</p>
<p>At the very moment when that dispatch was
penned the Confederates with their entire strength
were actually on march to assail an enemy who had
"scarcely the faintest idea of an attack" being made
upon him either then or later. In his memoirs General
Grant said:</p>
<p>"When all reinforcements should have arrived I
expected to take the initiative by marching on Corinth
and had no expectation of needing fortifications.
... The fact is I regarded the campaign we were
engaged in as an offensive one and had no idea that
the enemy would leave strong intrenchments to take
the initiative when he knew he would be attacked
where he was, if he remained."</p>
<p>It had been the purpose of General Johnston to
deliver his blow on the morning of the fifth of April,
overthrow Grant, and be prepared to fall upon
Buell when he should arrive. But matters of detail
went so far wrong that the Confederates, advancing
from Corinth to attack, did not reach the neighborhood
of Shiloh church, where Sherman was posted
without fortifications, until nightfall of that day.

<pb id="VAC0885-324" n="318"/>
                    
They bivouacked very near the Federal lines, but
strangely enough their presence in force was not discovered
by the enemy they purposed to fall upon at
daylight.  In the meanwhile the head of Buell's
column had come up and the rest of it was dangerously
near at hand.</p>
<p>The Confederates made their assault with great
impetuosity at dawn of April 6. The first that Sherman,
who held the advance of Grant's position, knew
of the impending battle was when the Confederates
forty thousand strong rushed upon his camps and
after a brief but stubborn struggle carried them,
Sherman being driven back so hurriedly that he left
his tents standing and the breakfasts of his men not
yet cooked. The first that Grant knew of a tremendous
attack of which he had had "scarcely the faintest
idea," was when at his headquarters at Savannah several
miles down the river he heard the guns at work
at Shiloh.</p>
<p>There has been much and angry discussion of the
question whether or not Grant and Sherman were
"surprised," in the military acceptation of the term,
by the Confederate onslaught at Shiloh. The point
has little historical importance, but in the light of all
the facts since disclosed by the records it is difficult
to interpret what happened there otherwise than as
a complete surprise, which but for the excellent discipline
of the Federal troops and their superb fighting
quality might easily have ended in disaster. We
have seen that Halleck in St. Louis did not intend to
leave for the front, where he expected to command
in person, until the next day or even later. We have

<pb id="VAC0885-325" n="319"/>
                    
seen how confident Grant was in his belief that the
Confederates intended no general attack either then
or later and how he planned himself to take the offensive.
It is certain that Grant's forces were not disposed
as they would have been if an assault by the
enemy had been anticipated. The several advance
corps were posted with little or no reference to cooperation
between them to resist an enemy assaulting
in force. No line of battle had been formed or in
any way provided for. Sherman, who was first
assailed, was resting quietly in camps which would
very certainly have been stripped for action if an
attack had been expected. Indeed, Sherman's very
latest reports to Grant had expressed the utmost confidence
that no attack was in contemplation, and that
the Confederates would do nothing more than annoy
the pickets. He reported to Grant that they "will
not press our pickets far." In brief it is obvious that
neither Halleck at St. Louis, nor Grant at Savannah,
Tennessee, nor Sherman, holding the front at Shiloh
meeting house, anticipated a battle in front of Pittsburg
Landing. They expected to fight on the offensive
at Corinth when they should be ready to advance,
but the thought of having to defend themselves
against a Confederate force assailing them at Shiloh
seems never to have occurred to them until the Confederates
fell upon Sherman's camp with their "yell,"
for a first warning of their presence.</p>
<p>Sherman with two brigades lay in front. The two
brigades were widely separated, as they would not
have been had an attack in force been regarded as
even a possibility. McClernand's division lay far in

<pb id="VAC0885-326" n="320"/>

rear of Sherman. Prentiss, Hurlbut, W. H. L. Wallace
and the commander of C. F. Smith's force--that
general being ill--with their several divisions were
scattered about in the rear all the way to Pittsburg
Landing, while Lew Wallace with about five thousand
men was posted several miles farther down the
river in complete isolation from the rest of the force.</p>
<p>General Van Horne, writing under the direct inspiration
of General George H. Thomas and with all
the orders and dispatches under his eye, says that the
several divisions "were widely separated and did not
sustain such relations to each other that it was possible
to form quickly a connected defensive line; they had
no defenses and no designated line for defense in the
event of a sudden attack, and there was no general on
the field to take by special authority the command of
the whole force in an emergency."</p>
<p>The ground in front of Pittsburg Landing was
especially well adapted to defense. Flanked on
either side by creeks difficult to cross, it compelled the
assailants to depend almost entirely upon direct
assault in front with little chance of success in any
effort they might make to turn either flank.</p>
<p>There was as yet no officer authorized to take general
command, General Grant being at Savannah, far
from the field, but the division commanders, each acting
upon his own responsibility, quickly responded to
the need, and not long after Sherman's camps had
been overrun there was a very tolerable line of battle
contesting the Confederate advance with great obstinacy
and determination.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Grant had ordered up such reinforcements

<pb id="VAC0885-327" n="321"/>
                    
as were at hand and was himself hurrying
to the scene to give personal direction to the battle.
He found multitudes of stragglers and skulkers
cowering under the river bank, as is always the case
during a battle when a place of refuge near at hand
offers a tempting security to the cowardly. But
apart from these spiritless ones he found the men of
his army bearing themselves right gallantly and contesting
every inch of the ground over which the Confederates
were slowly beating them back towards the
river.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Confederates was to break
through the left of Grant's line and reach the river,
thus placing themselves on their enemy's flank, threatening
his rear and imperiling his entire army. General
Albert Sydney Johnston had been mortally
wounded early in the afternoon, but Beauregard,
upon whom the Confederate command had devolved,
adopted and sought to carry out the strategy determined
upon. Late in the afternoon, he hurled the
whole of Bragg's force upon the left of Grant's line
with an impetuosity which must have achieved success
had the tremendous assault been made an hour
earlier. But fortunately for the Federals General
Buell had come up with a part of his army. He
quickly threw such regiments as he had with him into
action at the point of danger, and the danger was
really extreme. It was only necessary for the Confederates
to push Grant's left wing back for about
two hundred yards farther than it had been pushed
already in order to seize upon the landing and completely
cut Grant off from his gunboats and transports

<pb id="VAC0885-328" n="322"/>

acting as ferry-boats, and from all hope of
further reinforcement.</p>
<p>In that case Grant's problem would have been to
save his shattered army from complete overthrow,
with surrender as the well-nigh inevitable result.
There is little doubt that the left wing must have
given way before Bragg's assault, as the Confederates
expected it to do, but for the reinforcement which
Buell sent into action at the critical moment. This
reinforcement saved the left wing from the destruction
intended for it.</p>
<p>This statement is made upon the very careful and
trustworthy authority of General Van Home, writing
under direct inspiration of General Thomas. In
his "Memoirs" General Grant repudiates the claim
of Buell's having rendered important assistance at
that time and insists that he rendered him no help
of any consequence on the first day of the battle.
But the memoirs were written from the memory of a
very ill man many years after the event, and may
therefore be erroneous. At any rate General Van
Home's account of what happened, supported as it
is by copies of all the orders given, seems the more
trustworthy authority on the point at issue.</p>
<p>Night was now near at hand. During a long day
of continuous and desperate fighting Grant had been
slowly beaten back to the neighborhood of the river
bank. There he stood at bay with all his artillery and
all his infantry massed in a commanding position,
shattered and broken, and standing in desperate defense
of a point from which he could retreat no
farther without retreating into the river.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-329" n="323"/>

<p>Across his front lay a deep ravine. This would
have been difficult for his enemy to cross under the
best of conditions. It was rendered the more difficult
by the fact that it was in part filled with back water
from the river. Still more important was the fact
that it was completely commanded by a plunging fire
from the Federal artillery which in spite of defeat
stood resolutely to its guns.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the passage of that ravine was not
quite impossible to a determined foe; more difficult
tasks have been accomplished by generals of desperate
courage commanding such an army as that under
Beauregard had proved itself to be during that unflinching
day of slaughter.</p>
<p>It was a critical moment of the war--we may
almost say it was the critical moment of the war.
If Beauregard could have forced that ravine he must
have driven his adversary into the river or compelled
the surrender of the Federal army with its complete
destruction as the only alternative. On the other
hand, if he failed to force the ravine that night it
would be forever too late. For Buell's whole army
was now within call and it was certain that on the
following day, if Grant were not now destroyed, there
would be a Federal force on the Confederate side of
the river with which Beauregard could not reasonably
hope to cope successfully.</p>
<p>It would perhaps be unjust to say that at this supreme
crisis Beauregard faltered and failed. The
peril of the attempt was so great and the certainty of
slaughter so appalling that the very stoutest heart
might well have shrunk from the desperate hazard.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-330" n="324"/>

<p>Beauregard himself has told us in his official reports,
and in Colonel Roman's inspired book, that he
was unwilling to order a movement so desperate in
its chances and so certain to involve a slaughter of
brave men greater than any that has been anywhere
recorded in the annals of modern war. He was satisfied
with the day's work done and confident of complete
victory on the morrow. So sure was he of this
that he sent dispatches to Richmond that night announcing
a victory of stupendous proportions and
painting it in colors so glowing that President Davis
was moved to send a congratulatory message to the
Congress, and that body passed resolutions of the
most enthusiastic kind.</p>
<p>During that night Buell's army, itself outnumbering
what remained of Beauregard's, was hurrying to
reinforce Grant who planned to renew the conflict at
dawn with every prospect of reversing the first day's
results and wresting victory from what had been so
nearly a complete and disastrous defeat.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the seventh of April
Grant, reinforced by Buell's men and having now an
overmastering superiority of numbers, took the offensive
and assailed Beauregard's weakened army
with a determination which under the circumstances
could mean nothing less than victory.</p>
<p>But Beauregard was an obstinate fighter and a
skilful one and his men were Americans of the same
race and lineage and traditions as those they were
meeting in battle. There was terrible fighting, therefore,
on that second day, and it was only after a very
desperate and a very bloody struggle, hours long in

<pb id="VAC0885-331" n="325"/>
                    
duration, that Grant regained the ground lost on the
day before.</p>
<p>But Beauregard's struggle on that second day was
rendered hopeless from the outset by irresistible odds
of numbers, and after a heroic resistance he withdrew
his army and retired in good order and unmolested
to his strongly fortified position at Corinth.</p>
<p>Thus ended one of the great and decisive battles
of the war. The Federals had lost 13,047 men--
killed, wounded and prisoners. The Confederate loss
was officially reported at 10,699 men. They had
captured the whole of Prentiss's division, 2,200 strong.</p>
<p>But the respective losses did not accurately measure
the importance of the contest. The battle left
the Confederates baffled in their attempt to overthrow
Grant, but not less determined than ever to fight the
matter out to that conclusion which they religiously
believed to be their due of righteousness. On the
other hand, it left the Federal army in overmastering
force on the Confederate side of a river which constituted
the last serious natural obstacle to Grant's
purposed march to the gulf.</p>
<p>But Grant was again immediately superseded in
the chief command and forbidden to press the Confederates
with that tireless and ceaseless activity
which was the dominant characteristic of his military
methods. He had now an army of about 120,000
men. In front of him lay the enemy upon a weakly
defensive line with an army reduced by battle losses
to less than 40,000 effectives. It was obviously
Grant's greatest opportunity, but he was not permitted
to seize it and turn it to account. For no

<pb id="VAC0885-332" n="326"/>
    
sooner was the battle completely won than General
Halleck hurried down from St. Louis and himself
assumed command.</p>
<p>His orders were paralyzing. Instead of pushing
forward with his force, that outnumbered the Confederates
by about three to one, and quickly making
an end of their resistance, he fortified and proceeded
to busy himself with the petty and nagging criticism
of battle reports while the Confederates were doing
all that remained possible to them to gather recruits,
to strengthen their position at Corinth and to prepare
means of resistance farther South.</p>
<p>When we shall come to consider in a future chapter,
what else had happened, we shall see clearly that
by his victory on the second day of the Shiloh battle,
taken in connection with other occurrences, General
Grant had made easily possible the immediate and
complete conquest of the entire Mississippi Valley.
It only required an immediate and determined advance
such as General Grant naturally and eagerly
desired to make, in order to complete that work at
once. He says in his "Memoirs" that two days would
have been ample for the conquest of Corinth. But
General Grant was not in control of operations in the
western department. General Halleck was. General
Grant was no longer even in command of the
army with which he had driven General Beauregard
back to Corinth. General Halleck was, and instead
of pressing forward at once as Grant desired to do
and driving Beauregard still farther south while capturing
all his stores or compelling him to destroy
them, Halleck forbade all this and with three men to

<pb id="VAC0885-333" n="327"/>
                    
Beauregard's one, and with thrice or four times his
resources in artillery, ammunition and everything
else, he fortified at Shiloh and began a slowly scientific
approach to works that Grant, in command
of that army, would have run over as a schoolboy
tramples down a pathway through a clover field.
Halleck did not even begin this "scientific" advance
against Corinth until the thirtieth of April--more
than three weeks after the battle at Shiloh had
opened the way. It took him, by his slow methods,
a full month more to reach Corinth--less than
twenty miles away--and when he got there at last
he found the place already evacuated, the Confederates
having made good use of the seven or eight
weeks' time which his dilatoriness had thus allowed
them in removing their guns, ammunition and stores
to newly fortified positions farther south.</p>
<p>But Grant's achievement at Shiloh was too great
to be ignored. Again, as after the capture of Forts
Henry and Donelson, the land was resounding with
the praises of this Galena clerk Ulysses S. Grant,
and nobody outside the war department at Washington
was even thinking of his superior officer, General
Halleck.</p>
<p>But in order clearly to understand what and how
much all this meant, it is necessary in another chapter
to recount what else had happened of a nature calculated
to contribute to the recovery of the Mississippi
river and the Mississippi Valley, and to the severance
of the Confederacy in twain,</p>

<p>While the battle of Shiloh was in progress another
strategically important struggle was fought out.</p>
<p>By way of defending the Mississippi and holding
it within Confederate control the Southern generals
had strongly fortified New Madrid Bend and Island
Number 10.</p>
<p>Let us explain. The Mississippi river is exceedingly
tortuous in its course. Some miles above New
Madrid in Missouri, it suddenly turns northwardly
and makes a great bend. At or near the northerly
curve of that bend lies the village of New Madrid,
Missouri.  There the Confederates had fortified
themselves and there General Pope with his army in
Missouri was threatening them.</p>
<p>In the course of that vast bend lay Island Number
10, and here the Confederates had still more determinedly
fortified themselves with a view of holding
the great river. They had a strong force at Fort
Pillow, on the Tennessee bank farther down the
stream. They held Memphis on the Chickasaw bluffs
240 miles below Cairo. They had possession of Vicksburg
and Port Hudson, but those positions had not
yet been made strongholds by elaborate fortifications.
They still held New Orleans and the defenses below
that city, though they were destined soon to lose them.

<pb id="VAC0885-335" n="329"/>
                    
Thus they commanded the river and made of it a
Confederate highway. It was the obvious policy of
the Confederates to retain possession of that great
river. It was the equally obvious policy of their adversaries
to conquer control of it.</p>
<p>When Beauregard wisely, and indeed under strategic
compulsion, withdrew the forces from Columbus,
Kentucky, he sent some of the troops constituting
the garrison and most of the guns that bristled from
the useless fortifications of that town to New Madrid
and Island Number 10, where they were needed.</p>
<p>Early in March General Pope moved down the
Mississippi on its western side, and began operations
for the reduction of New Madrid. When he had got
his siege guns into position and opened a serious bombardment,
the works there were quickly abandoned.</p>
<p>Then began the assault upon Island Number 10,
the one great northern stronghold of the Confederates
in the Mississippi river, designed to hold that
great waterway and forbid to the Federals its use as a
thoroughfare into the heart of the South.</p>
<p>The Federal army cut a canal across the peninsula
formed by the great bend in the river. All the naval
force that the Federals could command in those
waters was brought to bear not only for the reduction
of the forts there but still more for the beating
off of the Confederate gunboats under Commodore
Hollins. On the other hand Commodore Foote ran
the canal with his Federal gunboats and established
himself in a commanding position in reverse of the
forts while Pope crossed the stream and assailed the
enemy in front with all his land forces.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-336" n="330"/>

<p>The situation of the Confederates was a hopeless
one and after an effort to escape they surrendered
nearly 7,000 men and more than 150 guns, most of
them of large caliber and formidable destructive
force.</p>
<p>This occurred on the second day of the Shiloh
battle, April 7, 1862, on which day, after a heroic
effort to breast Grant's overwhelming numbers,
Beauregard withdrew from Shiloh to Corinth. This
capture of Island Number 10 opened the Mississippi
to Memphis, except for the single and, as it afterwards
proved to be, the utterly ineffective position at
Fort Pillow.</p>
<p>General Halleck was fully informed of all that
had happened. He knew that Pope's way was open
down the Mississippi to Memphis, and that Memphis,
scarcely at all defended, was within his easy grasp.
He knew of course that Memphis was the westerly
end of the new defensive line of the Confederates,
and that its capture must compel them still further to
retire toward the south, even should he fail or neglect
to drive them from the Memphis and Charleston railroad
line at Corinth, as he easily might have done with
his utterly overwhelming force, and as Grant would
undoubtedly have done if that vigorously aggressive
general had been left in control of that splendidly
equipped army. But Halleck sat still and pottered
over "reports" that annoyingly paid no tribute to his
genius and suggested no credit to him for the victory
that had been won.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Grant was losing time. The Confederates,
foreseeing the inevitable loss of Memphis,

<pb id="VAC0885-337" n="331"/>
                    
which happened on the sixth of June, nearly two
months after energy would easily have compelled it,
were busily fortifying all defensible positions on the
river below, especially at Vicksburg and Port Hudson,
and thus making necessary one of the most
strenuous and one of the bloodiest campaigns of the
war, where scarcely any campaign at all would have
been necessary but for the fact that a martinet officer,
much too "scientific" and too "regular" for the
practical purposes of war, was in authority over a
man who knew not only how to plan campaigns but
how to conduct them quickly to a successful conclusion.</p>

<p>There was still another man of splendid genius and
capacity who about this time came to the front as a
winner of victories for the Federal arms, and above
all, as a man like Grant, who knew how to do things
when officialism permitted him to act. Like Grant
on the one side, and Lee on the other, Farragut was
at first treated as a negligible factor in the war.</p>
<p>David Glasgow Farragut was a man of Southern
birth who had been twice married in Virginia, and all
of whose kindred and connections and instinctive
sympathies were Southern. He so far sympathized
with the South indeed that he openly declared his
purpose to go with the Confederacy if by any means
the division of the country could be peacefully arranged
and accomplished. But, living as he did at
the outbreak of the war in a strongly secessionist Virginia
town, he frankly declared his lack of faith in the
peaceful accomplishment of secession, and his fixed
purpose in the event of war to cast in his lot with the
cause of the nation, which, all his long life--for he
was sixty years old--he had served, and from which all
his honors had come. This declaration quickly made
Norfolk, in which city he was living, "too hot" for him
in its popular sentiment, and accordingly he removed
to the North to await events.</p>
                    
<pb id="VAC0885-339" n="333"/>

<p>At that time Farragut was a captain in the navy.
He was by all odds the officer in that service most
distinguished for brilliant, daring and competently
effective performance. He had entered the navy
"through a port hole," as he said, at nine years of
age. He had served with such distinction under
Commodore Porter, that at twelve years of age he
had been intrusted by the great seaman with the command
of a richly laden prize ship, navigating her for
fifteen hundred miles into the harbor of Valparaiso,
and there arranging for her condemnation. He had,
while yet a mere boy, distinguished himself for courage
in a severely-contested sea fight.</p>
<p>In brief, this Captain Farragut was obviously, and
unquestionably, the very fittest man to undertake any
difficult naval expedition that the Washington government
might plan or contemplate.</p>
<p>But he had the taint of Southern birth and connections,
and it was nearly a year after he offered
himself unreservedly for any service that might be
required of him when the politicians who controlled
the Navy Department at Washington ventured to
make use of his abilities.</p>
<p>And when at last these people in the Navy Department
reconciled themselves to the thought of giving
an important command to this brilliantly distinguished
naval officer, who shared with Winfield Scott and
George H. Thomas the suspicious disadvantage of
Southern birth and connections, they did it in a way
insultingly suggestive of their doubt as to his loyalty
or courage or something else essential.</p>
<p>New Orleans was in every way--in population,

<pb id="VAC0885-340" n="334"/>

exports, imports, and everything else--the chief city of
the Southern Confederacy. Moreover its strategic
position was one which commanded a vast system of
inland waterways constituting the only effective link
between the Confederate country west of the Mississippi
and that part of the Confederacy that lay east
of the great river.</p>
<p>The city lies about a hundred miles, to use round
figures, above the multitudinous mouths of the 
Mississippi. It lies less than half a dozen miles west of
the so-called Lake Pontchartrain, which is an inlet
from the gulf, with two other bodies of water, 
Mississippi Sound and Lake Borgne, lying between.</p>
<p>But the passes into Lake Borgne and from that
body of water into Lake Pontchartrain, are shallow
and difficult, as the British discovered in 1814 in their
attempt to approach New Orleans by the "back door,"
as it were.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Mississippi has five principal
mouths, with some others that carry less water.
Thus it was, or seemed to be, impossible for any Federal
fleet to blockade the entrances to that stream and
cut off commerce between New Orleans and the outer
world.</p>
<p>But above and beyond all these considerations, was
the desire of the Federal authorities to conquer control
of the Mississippi itself throughout its entire
length. That would be not only to split the Confederacy
into halves, cutting off a large part of its food
resources, but also to make of the great river a convenient
highway for the transportation of Federal
food supplies, troops, ammunition and all else that


<pb id="VAC0885-341" n="335"/>

is needful in war, to such points as might have need
of them.</p>
<p>Thus the reduction of the defenses of New Orleans,
and the conquest of that city became a matter of supreme
strategic importance. To this task Farragut
was assigned with a fleet that, in our time, could not
possibly force its way past a single well-defended
fort, or successfully meet an adversary afloat. He
had in his fleet, first of all--in Navy Department
estimation--twenty-one schooners, each carrying a mortar
intended to throw shells high in air and drop them
into the Confederate defensive works. These proved
to be utterly useless, as Farragut had from the beginning
believed that they would be. He had besides,
six sloops of war, sixteen gunboats, and eight other
ships. His flagship, the <hi rend="i">Hartford</hi>, was a wooden 
vessel, carrying twenty-two Dahlgren nine-inch guns besides
howitzers in the tops. The others were similarly
armed. All were under-powered, and could make
only eight knots an hour where there was no current.
In such a stream as the Mississippi four knots constituted
the limit of their performance. There were
transports also, carrying an army of about 15,000
men under command of General Benjamin F. Butler.
This force was intended to occupy the city after
Farragut should have captured it, but until he should
do so it was only an incumbrance to his expedition.
He got rid of it for a time by landing the troops on
one of the islands that separate Mississippi Sound
from the gulf, and leaving them there until such
time as he should have need of them.</p>
<p>The civilians in control of the Navy Department

<pb id="VAC0885-342" n="336"/>
                    
had not in any adequate way consulted Farragut as
to the composition or the armament of the fleet with
which he was required to accomplish a task that was
next to impossible. In making up the fleet they had
accepted the suggestions of his subordinate, Commander
David D. Porter, and in obedience to them
had created the flotilla largely out of mortar schooners
which Farragut regarded as practically useless,
and which in the event proved to be altogether so.
That is to say, after the manner of that time they had
consulted with the less experienced inferior instead
of asking the advice of the thoroughly experienced
superior. They had been guided by an officer who was
not to command the expedition, instead of asking the
advice of the officer who was to lead it. But Farragut
was so anxious to proceed upon the country's business
and in some way to serve it that he promptly accepted
the command offered to him and expressed
himself as "satisfied" with the ship force provided for
him to command.</p>
<p>Expert as he was in all that pertained to Mexican
Gulf geography and hydrography, he perfectly knew
that one of the principal ships assigned to him could
in no wise be dragged into the Mississippi because of
her excessive draught of water. Expert as he was in
all that pertained to naval warfare, he foresaw that
the mortar fleet assigned to him could accomplish
nothing, and that its presence in his squadron could
be nothing other than an embarrassment. In the
same way he saw clearly that General Butler's land
force, carried upon transports, could not fail to be a
weak spot in his armor. Yet he uncomplainingly

<pb id="VAC0885-343" n="337"/>

accepted the conditions and set about the duty
assigned him.</p>
<p>It was with this utterly inadequate and motley
crew of serviceable and unserviceable and positively
detrimental ships that Farragut was ordered to reduce
the defenses of New Orleans, overthrow its naval
resistance and conquer the city.</p>
<p>Farragut was fully aware of the utter inadequacy
of the means given to him. He perfectly knew that
the effective vessels at his disposal were far fewer and
far less formidable than the task set him required.
But it was his habit to undertake desperate enterprises
with inadequate means, and he had waited a long time
for any opportunity, however meager, to serve his
country. So, in the great generosity of his mind, he
expressed to the Navy Department his willingness to
undertake the desperate enterprise with the obviously
insufficient, and in part the absurdly worthless, force
assigned to him to command.</p>
<p>Then came his orders from the civilians, who, without
experience or knowledge, or skill, or any other
recognizable qualification for command, controlled
the Navy Department. These orders were insulting
in their tone and manner. It was quite a matter of,
course that so old, so tried, so skilful an officer as
David Glasgow Farragut would do the very best that
was possible with the means placed at his command.
Yet the Navy Department people suggested doubt
of this by the very terms of the orders they gave
him.</p>
<p>These orders instructed him to reduce the defenses
of the Mississippi and take possession of New 

<pb id="VAC0885-344" n="338"/>

Orleans. They took no account of difficulties. They
reckoned not upon things in the way. They merely
ordered a thing done as one might order a carpet
cleaned or a load of wood sawed into stove lengths.
Then those orders went on to say: "As you have expressed
yourself perfectly satisfied with the force
given to you, and as many more powerful vessels will
be added before you can commence operations, <hi rend="i">the
department and the country require of you success.</hi>"</p>
<p>Could there have been anything more impertinent
than this, from a purely civilian department to an
officer who for half a century had been accustomed to
make success the keynote of all his reports of action?
Could there have been anything more insolent or more
insulting than the suggestion that David Glasgow
Farragut might do less than lay within his power
to do toward the accomplishment of any purpose to
which he might be commissioned? Could anything be
more insolent than the reminder that in consenting to
undertake the expedition he had declined to criticise
the composition of the fleet concerning which he had
not been consulted and had expressed himself as "satisfied"
to undertake the expedition with the means
provided to his hand?</p>
<p>Now let us consider the terms and conditions of
Farragut's problem, the nature of the work he had to
do, the tools he had to do it with, and the difficulties
he must overcome in order to achieve the success "required"
of him.</p>
<p>The Mississippi river is the greatest waterway in
the world. It is the middle thread of a system embracing
more than sixteen thousand miles of 

<pb id="VAC0885-345" n="339"/>

practically navigable rivers, bayous and creeks. In its
ramifications it drains no less than twenty-eight states
of the Union. In its course it flows from the Rocky
Mountains on the one side, the Alleghenies on the
other, and the Cumberland, the Ozark, and the Missouri
ranges, into a single great stream.</p>
<p>New Orleans lies in a bend of that tortuous stream
within about one hundred miles from its mouths.</p>
<p>But this greatest of rivers, dividing the eastern
from the western United States, and, in its great
tributaries dividing the north from the south, instead
of broadening in its course toward the sea after the
usual manner of rivers, narrows itself below New
Orleans to a width of half a mile or less.</p>
<p>Here the Confederates had established their defenses,
or more properly speaking, here they had
made themselves masters of defenses created by the
National Government before a thought of civil war
had arisen in any mind.</p>
<p>So far as the "back door" approach was concerned--
the approach by way of Lake Borgne and the Rigolets
and Lake Pontchartrain--New Orleans was adequately
defended by the shallowness of the water at
critical points. Unless a special fleet of shallow-
draught gunboats should be built at Ship Island or
elsewhere there was no possibility of reaching the
chief city of the Confederacy by that route. Farragut's
only hope lay, therefore, in ascending the
Mississippi river.</p>                    
<p>His first obstacle was encountered in the mouth of
the Mississippi itself. The great river carries with it
to the sea a limitless quantity of mud which it 

<pb id="VAC0885-346" n="340"/>

deposits in whatever spot there may be ready to receive
it. It is credited by the geologists with having created
in this way all the low-lying lands from Cairo to the
gulf, a distance of nearly twelve hundred miles by
the river's course. At the several mouths of the
stream it is still depositing mud and still pushing the
land out into the gulf. Very naturally its mud deposits
create bars at the several mouths. Long after
the war was over, Captain Eads with his jetties undertook
to compel the current to wash out channels
in the principal mouths and thus to render easy the
approach of ships to New Orleans. But nothing of
that kind had been done in the early sixties, and the
Federal fleet that was charged with the duty of reducing
the forts and capturing the city must first
force its way through shifting mud banks in order to
get into the river. The useless mortar schooners entered
easily by the Pass á l'Outre, but the vessels that
were to do the effective fighting had far greater difficulty.
It required three weeks of strenuous night
and day exertion to force them through the Southwest
Pass--the principal mouth of the river--and
even then one of them, the <hi rend="i">Colorado</hi>, had to be left
outside.</p>
<p>Having thus passed the first and purely natural
defense of New Orleans, Farragut had next to encounter
the artificial defenses of the river itself.
These consisted of two forts at the narrowest part of
the stream, together with some adjunctive defenses
presently to be mentioned.</p>
<p>These forts were two very imperfectly armed
works--Fort St. Philip on the eastern bank, and Fort

<pb id="VAC0885-347" n="341"/>

Jackson on the western. They mounted about 109
effective guns, some of them of obsolete pattern, only
a few of which--estimated at fourteen--were protected
by casemates. Captain Mahan, in his "Life of
Farragut," tells us that these forts had been largely
stripped of their armament, and were very imperfectly
equipped for the defensive work required of
them.</p>
<p>In the river above the forts lay a Confederate war
fleet of fifteen vessels, including an iron-clad ram
and an iron-clad floating battery, both carrying heavy
guns. This fleet had been stupidly weakened by the
withdrawal of Hollins's gunboats "for inconsequent
service at Memphis.</p>
<p>Below the forts was a great chain barrier stretched
across the river and supported by hulks anchored in
the stream for that purpose. For the protection of
this barrier the shores were lined with Confederate
sharpshooters--riflemen accustomed to hit whatever
they might shoot at.</p>
<p>Having got his fleet into the river after weeks of
toil--leaving one very important vessel behind--it
was Farragut's task to assail and overcome these defenses
and force his way through a strong fleet, up
the narrow river to the city he was ordered to capture.</p>
<p>Farragut, as has been said already and as he had
bluntly told the Navy Department, had no confidence
whatever in the effectiveness of the mortar fleet,
which was in charge of its originator, David D. Porter.
He would have preferred to leave that part of
his squadron behind as an entirely useless and embarrassing
incumbrance; but he was a man of generous


<pb id="VAC0885-348" n="342"/>

mind and never arrogantly opinionated. So he gave
Porter the fullest possible opportunity to demonstrate
the effectiveness of his mortar fleet.</p>
<p>There were twenty-one of the mortar schooners,
each carrying a mortar of thirteen inches caliber,
which threw shells weighing two hundred and eighty-
five pounds each. These shells were filled with such
charges of gunpowder as made them, in theory at
least, terrible engines of destruction when they exploded.
It was Porter's firm conviction that by their
fire alone he could compel the Confederates to abandon
their forts and leave the way clear for the fleet to
sail on up the river with only the Confederate war
vessels to contest their passage. Farragut did not
expect any such result, but he gave Porter every opportunity.</p>
<p>Securely anchored in a position of Porter's own
selection, the mortar schooners opened fire on the
eighteenth of April. For six consecutive days and
nights they threw their fearful missiles, each in itself
a mine, into the forts. They threw in all six thousand
of these shells, weighing in the aggregate no less than
eight hundred and fifty-five tons. They killed or
wounded only fifty men--a picket guard in numbers--
or, as Dr. Rossiter Johnson has curiously calculated,
they killed or wounded about one man to every
sixteen tons of iron hurled into the forts.</p>
<p>This was at the rate of only eight casualties a day,
a bagatelle in war and very naturally a bombardment
so slightly effective utterly failed to render the forts
untenable or to drive out the brave men who were set
to defend them. On the contrary the Confederate fire

<pb id="VAC0885-349" n="343"/>

in response to the mortars sank one of the schooners
and disabled one of the steamers.</p>
<p>Thus was again taught the familiar lesson of war,
that the terrific is not necessarily the effective fire in
battle.</p>
<p>So far from abandoning their forts under this fearful
rain of metal and explosives the Confederates
were busying themselves night and day in determined
and intelligently directed efforts to destroy their adversary's
fleet. They sent down the river a multitude
of blazing fire-rafts, and it required not only all of
Farragut's wonderful foresight and ingenuity but
constant and very earnest exertions on the part of his
crews to ward off this danger.</p>
<p>At last the mortar experiment was done. It had
utterly failed to accomplish its intended purpose of
reducing the forts or compelling their evacuation.
Farragut was dealing with an enemy of his own determined
kind, an enemy as resolute, as daring, and
as patiently enduring as he himself was.</p>
<p>He decided at last to push his fleet past the forts at
all hazards, and, leaving those works as an enemy in
his rear, to try conclusions in a decisive battle with the
Confederate fleet that lay in wait for him in the river
above. It was a dangerous and a daring thing to do.
Indeed, it was almost desperately daring. But Farragut's
habit of mind was daring. Moreover his orders
on this occasion offensively and insultingly
"required" success at his hands. It was his fixed purpose
either to achieve that success or to sink beneath
the muddy waters of the Mississippi in a determined
effort to achieve it.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-350" n="344"/>
                    
<p>His first care was to sever the chain barrier across
the river. To that end he sent a force up the stream
which gallantly boarded one of the hulks, cut the
chain, and rendered that defense useless.</p>                  
<p>On the morning of April 24, at 3.30 o'clock, the
fighting part of the fleet advanced in full force, engaging
the enemy to the right and left, but meanwhile
pushing its way up the river without waiting
for results at the point of obstruction.</p>
<p>The forts were quickly passed and then ensued one
of the most picturesque water battles ever fought.
The Confederates knew their business and they did
it with a skill and determination which excited Farragut's
admiration, as he was afterwards accustomed to
testify in glowing words of recognition.</p>
<p>Captain Theodorus Bailey, with eight vessels, was
the first to pass the forts. He immediately became
involved in a desperate encounter with the Confederate
fleet. His flagship, the <hi rend="i">Cayuga</hi>, was engaged at
once by three Confederate vessels, each determinedly
trying to board and capture her; for this was a battle
of giants in which every officer and every man on
either side was ready for any conceivable deed of
"derring-do," and in which personal courage of the
most dauntless sort was the one military equipment
which both sides possessed in absolutely limitless
supply.</p>
<p>Bailey destroyed one of his assailants with an
eleven-inch shell. Has the reader any conception of
what it means to have an eleven-inch shell penetrate
the side of a vessel and explode within its wooden
walls? In every eleven-inch shell there is a charge of

<pb id="VAC0885-351" n="345"/>

gunpowder of positively earthquake-producing proportions,
and when it explodes it wrecks everything
within hundreds of feet of it. Exploding within a
vessel it dismounts guns, kills men, rips up bulwarks
and bulkheads, and renders the ship a helpless wreck,
with fire everywhere to complete the destruction.</p>
<p>That is what happened to one of the ships that
assailed Captain Bailey. Another was driven off,
and before the third could accomplish its purpose the
<hi rend="i">Oneida</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Varuna</hi> came to the rescue. The
<hi rend="i">Oneida</hi> rammed one of the Confederate vessels, cutting
it in two. The <hi rend="i">Varuna</hi> had worse fortune. She
was successfully rammed by the Confederates, and
running ashore, sank helplessly.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="i">Pensacola</hi> sustained a loss of thirty-seven men
in passing the forts, a fact that eloquently testified to
the vigor that abode in those works after Porter's six
days' hail of great shells into their precincts.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="i">Mississippi</hi>, of Farragut's fleet, was rammed
and disabled by the Confederate iron-clad <hi rend="i">Manassas</hi>.
But, by way of revenge, the <hi rend="i">Mississippi's</hi> guns riddled
the ram and destroyed it.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the Confederates were sending
down fire-rafts in great numbers, and in an attempt
to avoid contact with two of these Farragut's flagship,
the <hi rend="i">Hartford</hi>, ran aground upon a mud bank and for
a time lay helpless in an exceedingly perilous position.</p>
<p>If the reader would fully understand the terror of
this "river fight" he should remember that at the
point where it occurred the Mississippi is only about
half a mile wide. Everything done at all in such a
stream must be done at close quarters, and it was at

<pb id="VAC0885-352" n="346"/>

the very closest of quarters that the Northern and
Southern Americans who contested that fight met
each other on that terrible morning of April 24,
1862. The men who fought there in the river on the
one side or upon the other, are mostly dead now; only
a few of them survive in soldiers' homes or sailors'
snug harbors. Surely we can do no better in this new
century than pay all possible honor to the valor with
which, on the one side and upon the other, they fought
for their respective causes on that soft spring morning
in the early sixties. They were heroes all, and
right heroically did they acquit themselves in the
brutal and bloody work they were set to do.</p>
<p>The net result of the contest was the destruction of
the Confederate fleet. With that out of the way
Farragut pushed on to New Orleans and with guns
out for action, demanded the city's surrender.</p>
<p>Only one issue was possible, of course. The city
was at Farragut's mercy. He could easily destroy
it should it resist. It only remained for him to
hoist the National flag over it and to send for General
Butler's land force to occupy and possess the
chief city of the South, which he did on the first of
May.</p>
<p>Butler's rule in the city, where the white population
at that time consisted chiefly of women and children,
was harsh and even brutal--so harsh and so brutal in
its attitude toward women as to offend sentiment both
North and South, and in Europe.</p>
<p>He issued one order which could not have come
from the headquarters of any man of soldierly instincts
or gentle associations. By way of resenting

<pb id="VAC0885-353" n="347"/>

the attitude and conduct of women toward a conquering
soldiery, he put forth a decree in these words:</p>

General Orders No. 28
<dateline>
Headquarters, Dept. of the Gulf,
New Orleans, May 15, 1862.
</dateline>
</opener>
<p>As the officers and soldiers of the United States have been
subject to repeated insults from the women (calling themselves
ladies) of New Orleans in return for the most scrupulous
non-interference and courtesy on our part, it is ordered that
hereafter when any female shall by word, gesture or movement,
insult or show contempt for any officer or soldier of the
United States, she shall be regarded and held liable to be
treated as a woman of the town plying her avocation.</p>

<salute>By order of Major-General Butler.</salute>

Assistant Adjutant General and
Chief of Staff.

</p>

<p>It needs no argument and no exposition to show
that in issuing this order Benjamin F. Butler deliberately
gave license and authority to the most brutal
impulses of the most degraded men under his command,
--authorizing them to judge for themselves
when they should choose to think themselves insulted
"by word, gesture, or movement," and upon every
such occasion, without further inquiry, and upon their
own initiative, to treat every woman who had occasion
to venture into the streets as "a woman of the town
plying her avocation."</p>
<p>With the cynicism that had equipped him for practice
in the criminal courts of Boston, Butler afterwards
explained his order by saying that the only
right way to treat "a woman of the town plying her
avocation," is to pass her by unnoticed. But he 

<pb id="VAC0885-354" n="348"/>
    
perfectly knew that that was not what his order meant
to his soldiery or what he meant it to mean.</p>                   
<p>The rigor of Butler's rule in New Orleans was in
some other respects salutary. He wantonly imprisoned
many citizens--men and women indifferently--
without warrant or just cause, but apart from that he
ruled the city to its advantage. In mortal dread of
yellow fever, he cleaned New Orleans as it had never
been cleaned before, and throughout a hot summer he
kept the city healthier than it had ever been in all its
history.</p>
<p>Having thus completely achieved that "success"
which the civilians of the Navy Department had "required"
of him, Farragut was ambitious to accomplish
more. He proposed further operations of like character
against other Confederate ports from which
commerce was being carried on in spite of the blockade.
It was quite obvious that no blockade could
stop this commerce on which the South so largely depended
for its supplies. The only way in which the
shutting in of the Confederacy could be made effective
was to capture the defensive works of every Confederate
port.</p>
<p>To that task Farragut earnestly desired to address
himself. It was his purpose to make himself master
of every Confederate seaport, relieve the blockading
squadrons of their expensive, perilous, difficult, and
ineffective work, and completely to seal the South
against all outward or inward commerce with the
world. His plan was to substitute the absolute possession
of Confederate ports for their manifestly 
inefficient blockade. He asked permission, therefore,

<pb id="VAC0885-355" n="349"/>

to proceed at once upon this mission, beginning with
Mobile.</p>
<p>The civilians in control of the Navy Department
promptly said him nay. They had other plans of a
more spectacular character. So they ordered Farragut
to proceed up the Mississippi river and waste
precious time and still more precious lives, in a
theatric but futile "running of the batteries" at Vicksburg
and Port Hudson.</p>
<p>Farragut obeyed of course. It was the habit of his
long life to obey. But he felt keenly the loss of 
opportunity which this order of a badly water-logged
cabinet bureau imposed upon him. While he was
thus, under compulsion of the incapables, wasting his
time in the Mississippi, the Confederates were sending
out precious cargoes of cotton and bringing in
still more precious ship-loads of cloth, shoes, artillery
harness, quinine, arms, ammunition and everything
else that ministered to the maintenance of their
armies in the field.</p>
<p>Here was another of those blunders of administration
which helped to prolong the war to twice its necessary
length and subjected the country, North and
South, to needless and intolerable burdens. But how
should a civilian Secretary of the Navy understand,
as Farragut did, the ways in which the navy could be
made most effectively to contribute to the ending of
the war? A system that puts a Gideon Welles in
control of a Farragut must take the consequences of
incapacity on the part of its official head.</p>
<p>Welles forbade Farragut to proceed to the conquest
and closing of the Confederate ports. He 

<pb id="VAC0885-356" n="350"/>

ordered him instead to waste time and energy and
human life in futile and fruitless operations in front
of Vicksburg, where even the most ordinary intelligence
should have seen clearly that the effective work
must be done by the land forces, and where Grant and
Sherman were ready to do it well.</p>
<p>This judgment does not rest upon the opinion of
the author of this history. It is supported in every
detail by the skilled criticism of no less a naval authority
than Captain Mahan. In his "Farragut," page
116 <hi rend="i">et seq</hi>., that highest authority in naval criticism
has written:</p>
<p>"The principal result of an effort undertaken without
due consideration was to paralyze a large fraction
of a navy too small in numbers to afford the detachment
which was paraded gallantly, but uselessly,
above New Orleans. Nor was this the worst. The
time thus consumed in marching up the hill in order at
once to march down again threw away the opportunity
for reducing Mobile before its defenses were
strengthened. Had the navy been large enough, both
tasks might have been attempted; but it will appear
in the sequel that its scanty numbers were the reason
which postponed the attack on Mobile from month to
month until it became the most formidable danger
Farragut ever had to encounter."</p>
<p>In other words, the policy of setting a Gideon
Welles to direct the naval operations of a Farragut,
resulted in making a difficult task out of a very easy
one. The fall of New Orleans served to warn the
'Confederates of the danger in which Mobile lay, and
while Welles was keeping Farragut uselessly and

<pb id="VAC0885-357" n="351"/>

against his will in the Mississippi, skilled Confederate
engineers were strengthening the Mobile defenses
and planting the harbor of that port with destructive
mines and torpedoes, so that Farragut's task of closing
that port, when months later he was reluctantly
permitted to undertake it, was difficult and perilous
in the extreme, where it had been simple, easy, and
scarcely at all dangerous to ships or seamen at the
time when he had asked permission to proceed to its
accomplishment.</p>
<p>But the Pinafore practice of setting an untrained,
inexperienced and ignorant politician to direct the scientific
and strictly professional work of highly trained
naval officers, is too firmly imbedded in our system
of administration to be disturbed by considerations
of mere common-sense. When war is on, the country
pays the penalty of this folly,</p>

<p>We have already seen from his own reports what
McClellan thought of the force he was called upon to
command at and near Washington after the disastrous
defeat of McDowell at Manassas. There was,
he said, "no army to command--a mere collection of
regiments, cowering on the banks of the Potomac,
some perfectly raw, others dispirited by recent defeat,
others going home..... Washington was
crowded with straggling officers and men absent from
their stations without authority."</p>
<p>Slowly, patiently, painfully, McClellan brought
order out of this chaos of demoralization. Out of the
broken and utterly dispirited fragments of McDowell's
army and out of the new, raw levies sent to him
he created that Army of the Potomac which fought
the great campaigns of the war.</p>
<p>In the meantime an ignorant and impatient popular
clamor and an unintelligent press "opinion"--for
there is a certain type of newspaper editor who is apt
to regard his own hasty and ill-informed judgment of
things that he knows little or nothing about, as an
"opinion"--hounded and persecuted the man who was
expected to retrieve the Manassas defeat. Even Mr.
Lincoln, with all his patience, became impatient of
McClellan's inaction--which was excessive perhaps--

<pb id="VAC0885-359" n="353"/>
                    
and almost angrily urged him to action. He called
the general's attention to the fact that he had under
his command a force greatly superior in numbers to
any that the Confederates could muster and that the
country was impatient for an advance.</p>
<p>McClellan seems to have had no thought of making
his way to Richmond by the route of Centreville and
Manassas, where Johnston lay behind impregnable
fortifications. He knew the easier road of approach
up the James river from Fortress Monroe as a base
of operations. But, at all hazards, the Government,
the press and the people insisted, Washington city
must be covered and protected, and so McClellan's
first care was to feel of the works at Centreville and
Manassas before transferring his army down the Potomac
and the Chesapeake to Fortress Monroe. Accordingly,
on the tenth of March, 1862, he pushed a
column forward toward Centreville and Manassas
only to find those strongly fortified positions already
abandoned. General Johnston had interpreted McClellan's
plans aright, and was transferring his army
to the Peninsula east of Richmond in order to meet
his adversary's confidently-expected advance in that
quarter.</p>
<p>There was nothing now, neither defended works
nor an opposing army, to forbid McClellan's march
upon Richmond by the Manassas route, while it was
certain that Johnston was fortifying Williamsburg
and other defensible points upon the other route and
concentrating his forces there to meet McClellan's
advance when it should come.</p>
<p>But McClellan was above all things a man of 

<pb id="VAC0885-360" n="354"/>
                    
orderly and methodic mind, a man not to be turned
from a pre-arranged plan of action by the offering
of any opportunity, however advantageous it might
be. So instead of pushing on towards Richmond by
the route which his enemy had thus left undefended,
he turned about, sent his army by water to Fortress
Monroe, and confronted his adversary where that adversary
was best prepared at all points to meet him.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile General Burnside had completed
the occupation of the southern coast by the seizure of
Beaufort, Roanoke, Newberne and Fort Macon, and
another Federal force a little later, on the eleventh of
April, captured Fort Pulaski, near the mouth of the
Savannah river.</p>
<p>After great urgency on the part of Mr. Lincoln,
who, in his homely phrase, feared that McClellan's
army might "take root" around Washington, that
officer at last transferred one hundred and twenty-one
thousand men to the neighborhood of Fortress Monroe,
with every adjunctive aid that an army could require
or make useful. His force outnumbered the
Confederates nearly two to one, but it was McClellan's
habit of mind to exaggerate the strength of his
enemy. It was also his bad habit, as it was Halleck's,
to proceed with an exaggerated respect for military
"regularity." So instead of pushing forward up the
peninsula that lay between the James and the York
rivers, and simply running over the vastly inferior
forces of his enemy, as a general of enterprising mind
would have done, he advanced "scientifically" and
with scientific slowness.</p>
<p>The first point of contact was at Yorktown, where

<pb id="VAC0885-361" n="355"/>
                    
General Magruder lay with 13,000 Confederates,
McClellan's army of assault--i.e., his advance force--
numbered no less than 58,000 men and 100 guns.
According to his custom McClellan enormously overestimated
the strength of his adversary, and instead
of hurling his superior force upon the Confederate
works, or using his fleet to pass them by, as General
Johnston expected him to do, he sat down before
Yorktown and instituted a regular siege approach by
parallels.</p>
<p>Reinforcements came to him daily and even hourly,
until he had nearly 120,000 men and more than a hundred
guns with which to assail Magruder's scant
13,000 men and less than thirty guns.</p>
<p>But he did not make the assault. Instead he remained
inactive for nearly a month before Yorktown
with about nine men under his command to his adversary's
one, doing nothing energetic or determined.
When at last he advanced upon the works which he
might have run over on the day of his arrival before
them, he found no force defending them and only
"dummy" guns in the shape of painted logs occupying
their embrasures. Comic opera itself has few
situations more ridiculous than was this of McClellan
at the end of his month's "siege" of Yorktown, defended
through a large part of the siege by less than
one man to his nine, and at the last defended only by
"quaker" guns, with no men at all behind them.</p>
<p>Finding that the position against which he had so
elaborately provided siege appliances was vacated by
his enemy, McClellan advanced to Williamsburg,
where he encountered actual resistance on the fourth
of May and the days following.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-362" n="356"/>
                    
<p>Here was one of those situations, of which the war
presented so many, which it is difficult to reconcile
with our accepted estimates of the military capacity of
the generals on either side.</p>
<p>McClellan was moving up the Peninsula, threatening
Richmond with about 120,000 men--official reports
say 119,965. He had left 70,000 men at or near
Washington to protect the capital, and the authorities
there had detained 10,000 or 15,000 more for
safety. McDowell, with 40,000 men of this force had
been pushed forward to Fredericksburg on the Potomac,
with the intent that he should make a junction
with McClellan before Richmond, swelling that general's
force to about 160,000 men. Jackson having
been driven back in the valley of Virginia the danger
to Washington seemed for the moment past, and
Franklin's division had been sent to strengthen McClellan's
main column.</p>
<p>In brief, McClellan had almost exactly 120,000
men immediately with him, while 40,000 more under
McDowell were moving unopposed from Fredericksburg
to join him and swell his army to about 160,000.
As McDowell was presently called back for the defense
of Washington, in view of the renewal of
"Stonewall" Jackson's threatening operations in the
Shenandoah Valley, it is only fair to reckon McClellan's
force at the 120,000, which his morning reports
showed that he had with him     below  Richmond.
Johnston in command at Richmond had rather less
than 50,000 men with which to oppose this force.</p>
<p>Deeply feeling his responsibility and the enormous
disadvantage at which he was placed, the Confederate

<pb id="VAC0885-363" n="357"/>

general asked for reinforcements. He proposed that
all the troops in the Carolinas, where they were in no
wise needed, and all in the valley of Virginia, and all
at Norfolk and other points from which they could
be spared, should be concentrated under his command
in front of Richmond, in order that with an
adequate force he might assail McClellan, who was
in a vulnerable position, and, overcoming him, turn
about and crush McDowell.</p>
<p>A council of war, of which General Robert E. Lee
was the dominant member, overruled this apparently
wise proposal, for reasons that have never been made
clear. Thus Johnston, with 50,000 men, was left to
defend Richmond against the double advance of
McClellan's 120,000 from the east and McDowell's
40,000 from the north.</p>
<p>To do that successfully he must, of course, fall
back to the neighborhood of the city and concentrate
his force behind the strongest earthworks he could
construct. The aggressive measures which he desired
to take were wholly out of the question for the time
at least.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Magruder made a stubborn stand at
Williamsburg, giving Johnston time to fortify. It
was only after two days of very severe fighting, and
with a loss of 2,200 men against a Confederate loss of
1,800 that McClellan at last forced the Confederate
detachment-for it was only a detachment and not a
very strong one at that--to fall back from Williamsburg
to the main line of defense and join itself to
Johnston's army, of which it was a part.</p>
<p>The battle of Williamsburg was strategically of no

<pb id="VAC0885-364" n="358"/>
                    
consequence except as a part of a campaign of delay.
It would be an idle waste of space, a needless taxing
of the reader's attention, to recount its strategy in
detail. It is sufficient to say that after delaying McClellan's
advance for two days and inflicting a heavy
loss upon him, the Confederates withdrew in good order
to the main defenses of Richmond.</p>
<p>McClellan now sent Franklin's division on transports
to the White House at the head of the York
river, to establish there a secure base of supplies. The
whole army followed and by the sixteenth of May it
was concentrated there.</p>
<p>This was then the situation. McClellan lay at the
White House within twenty-four miles of Richmond.
He had more nearly three than two men to his adversary's
one under his immediate command and he had
an army nearly equal to his enemy's, within two or
three days' march ready to reinforce him, or better
still, to assail his adversary in flank.</p>
<p>A general of such enterprise as General Sheridan,
or General Sherman, or General Grant, or General
Thomas, placed in such circumstances, would unquestionably
have pressed forward to the assault.</p>
<p>But McClellan's timid imagination swelled Johnston's
force of 50,000 or less to 120,000 or more and
he hesitated. Instead of pushing forward by the
shortest roads to Richmond he scientifically "developed"
his force along the Chickahominy river to the
north of Richmond, and, after fortifying, made a
requisition for reinforcements.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile "Stonewall" Jackson had achieved
some brilliant successes in the Shenandoah Valley

<pb id="VAC0885-365" n="359"/>

which so far seemed to threaten Washington with
assault, that McDowell's force of 40,000 men was recalled
from its march to reinforce McClellan and sent
to ward off the danger of an advance upon the Federal
capital by that peculiarly energetic and enterprising
commander.</p>
<p>But even without McDowell's expected reinforcement,
McClellan had greatly more than twice his adversary's
force. It is impossible to doubt that if he
had been moved by anything like Grant's habitual
and determined impulse to "press things" he would
promptly have hurled his overwhelming force against
his adversary's defensive lines.</p>
<p>McClellan, however, was not Grant nor such as he.
He had a superior skill in the theoretical science of
war but an immeasurably inferior capacity for war's
practical work.</p>
<p>North of Richmond and from five to seven miles
distant the Chickahominy river runs in a course almost
due east from its source. McClellan placed his main
force north of that erratic and uncertain stream and
there awaited the reinforcements for which he was
clamorously calling. But he threw his left wing
across the river to the Richmond side of it. Unless he
were prepared to advance at once with all his force
and assail the Confederate works this was an exceedingly
dangerous thing to do, for the Chickahominy is
a phenomenally uncertain and erratic river. In dry
weather it is scarcely more than a brook, but in periods
of rain--and spring in Virginia is a rainy season--it
swells suddenly and quickly to almost impassable
proportions, while the swamps that form its banks 

<pb id="VAC0885-366" n="360"/>
                    
become morasses in which it is difficult to find even a
foothold, and impossible to discover a fit camping
place for troops. When McClellan established his
left wing south of the river the stream presented no
obstacle to its prompt reinforcement from the other
side in case of need. But presently the windows of
heaven were opened and the fountains of the great
deep were broken up. The floods came, and this
isolated left wing was cut off and left mainly to its
own devices for self-maintenance.</p>
<p>The Confederate General Johnston was quick to
see and seize this opportunity. On the morning of
the thirty-first of May, he assailed the detached left
wing and there resulted the two-days' battle called
Fair Oaks at the North, and Seven Pines at the
South.</p>
<p>Johnston's force scarcely, if at all, outnumbered
the detached left wing of McClellan's army, but his
hope was, by determined fighting to cut off that part
of McClellan's army from the main body that lay
north of the river, and to crush and destroy it before
it could be reinforced.</p>
<p>In his first assaults he was conspicuously successful,
and had his expectation been realized that McClellan
would be unable to reinforce his detached left wing
from the other side of the river it is probable that
Johnston's operation would have made prisoners of
that wing of McClellan's army which lay south of the
turbulent river. But two events stood in the way.
One of the many frail bridges across the Chickahominy
remained, in spite of the floods, as an available
means of crossing. Some of its supports had given

<pb id="VAC0885-367" n="361"/>

way under pressure of the waters and it was manifestly
tottering to its fall. But General Sumner,
ordered to support the imperiled force south of the
river, heroically disregarded the danger and pushed
his force across the frail and tottering structure, ordering
his men to "break step" in the passage in order
that the swing of the cadenced step might not cause
the bridge to sway and fall. Thus perilously, he
crossed, just in time to meet and defeat a Confederate
effort to gain control of the bridge and destroy it,
thus completely cutting off communication between
the two wings of the Union Army.</p>
<p>The second event of importance in this battle was
the very serious wounding of General Johnston. He
received in his body a bullet, which incapacitated him
for months to come for any active service. This was
only one of thirteen wounds that Johnston had received
during his military career. General Scott had
described him as "a most capable officer, who has the
bad habit of getting himself wounded," and here
again he had indulged in that bad habit to the serious
detriment of the cause he served. For when he was
wounded the command passed into the hands of General
Gustavus W. Smith, ex-Street Commissioner of
New York City, whose fitness for so high a command
was, to say the very least, problematical. Under his
direction the movement by which Johnston had hoped
to achieve so much came to naught.</p>
<p>Two days later Robert E. Lee assumed direct command
of the Confederate Army at Richmond, and
from that hour forth the war took on a new character.
One of the two great master minds--Lee and Grant

<pb id="VAC0885-368" n="362"/>
                    
--was at last in control of the means with which the
struggle was to be fought out to a finish. The other
of those two great master minds was still under the
control of distinctly inferior "superiors."</p>
<p>With the advent of Lee to direct command, the
terms of the war problem were set anew. He made of
the Virginia army such a fighting machine as has
rarely been known in the history of the world. It was
not until nearly two years later that Grant was permitted
to act upon his conviction, repeatedly formulated,
that the strength of the Confederacy and the
danger to the Union lay, not in the possession of
strategic positions, but in the fighting force of that
Army of Northern Virginia which responded to
every demand of Lee for heroic self-sacrifice, as the
needle responds to the attraction of the pole. In the
meanwhile Lee and his army were a ceaseless menace
to the Federal capital and the Federal cause. From
the moment of his accession to command until the
hour in which he met Grant at the Wilderness, Lee
dictated the course and conduct of the war, and in an
extraordinary degree dominated its events.</p>

<p>No sooner had Lee come into command than he set
out to change and reverse the existing conditions of
the war. He was determined to drive McClellan
away from Richmond, to put an end to siege operations
that, if persisted in, must ultimately result in
the capture of that city, and to transfer to some
more distant point the scene of active hostilities. In
other words, it was Lee's purpose to change a dispiriting
defense into an all-inspiring offense, to raise
McClellan's siege of Richmond and to institute in its
stead operations that should put Washington upon
the defensive.</p>
<p>To that end he began by strengthening his army.
He deemed the time now ripe to adopt the plan which
he had negatived as premature when Johnston had
suggested it. He called to Richmond all the available
forces that could be spared from the Southern
coasts and elsewhere, swelling his army to 70,000 or
80,000 men.</p>
<p>This reinforcement did not indeed give him an
army equal to McClellan's in numbers or in equipment,
but it materially reduced the disparity between
the two opposing forces and opened the way to a hopeful
trial of conclusions in the field.</p>
<p>But there was, as already stated, a strong Federal

<pb id="VAC0885-370" n="364"/>

force marching by way of Fredericksburg to join
McClellan. It numbered more than 40,000 men and
was under the very capable command of General
McDowell. If that force should form a junction
with McClellan the odds against Lee, in spite of reinforcement,
would be decisive, and any attempt he
might make to save the Confederate capital by offensive
defense must fail.</p>
<p>Lee's first necessity, therefore, was to prevent McDowell's
army of 40,000 men from joining McClellan
before Richmond; his second purpose was to bring all
his own forces to bear at that crucial point for a supreme
effort to overthrow his adversary there.</p>
<p>He knew the excessive apprehension felt at the
North for the safety of Washington city, and he
played upon it with masterly skill. Ever since November,
1861, Stonewall Jackson had been in the Valley
of the Shenandoah trying with a totally inadequate
force to hold that region and upon occasion to
inflict what damage he could upon the foe, especially
by destroying a section of the Baltimore and Ohio
railroad and of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, upon
which the Federal communications between the forces
in West Virginia and the headquarters at Washington
depended. Jackson had done some brilliant
things in that quarter and had succeeded in detaining
there a Federal force much greater than his own,
which if set free to join McClellan would have made
the Federal army before Richmond irresistible in its
strength.</p>
<p>But inferiority of force was by no means the sorest
difficulty that Jackson had contended with during

<pb id="VAC0885-371" n="365"/>

all those months of winter marchings and fightings
amid snowstorms. On the Southern as on the Northern
side every really capable general was embarrassed
by the ignorant and intrusive dictation of men in
place above him. As Grant was paralyzingly dominated
by Halleck's interference at every critical moment
in his western campaigns, and as Farragut was
restrained from obviously easy and supremely desirable
achievement by the hand of ignorant authority
in the Navy Department at Washington, so Jackson,
in the Valley, found his military plans brought
to naught by the interference of a civilian Secretary
of War who, having authority, chose to use it in giving
orders to Jackson's troops in the field without so
much as consulting Jackson as to his reasons for posting
them as he had done. Beauregard and Johnston
at Manassas had encountered a like difficulty and had
several times been upon the point of resigning their
commissions in despair of achieving any worthy results
under such conditions of ignorant and arbitrary
control. Jackson was driven further and on the thirty-first
of January, 1862, he wrote in despair to Governor
Letcher of Virginia, asking that he be ordered
back to his professor's chair in the Virginia Military
Institute, and tendering his resignation as a major-
general if such an order could not be given.</p>
<p>The circumstances were these. With great difficulty,
at serious risk of defeat and by exacting a
positively heroic endurance on the part of his men in
marches through snow and sleet and mud, Jackson
had conquered the strategic control of the region under
his command from an enemy greatly outnumbering

<pb id="VAC0885-372" n="366"/>
                    
him. The strategic key to the position thus
conquered was Romney and there Jackson had stationed
Loring with a force strong enough to hold the
place while keeping in touch with Jackson himself.
This disposition rendered the valley, with all its strategic
advantages, a secure Confederate possession and
a military base from which it was easy to threaten or
with reinforcements to assail Washington and the
country north of the Potomac.</p>
<p>No sooner had Jackson by genius and heroic endeavor
secured this advantage for the Confederate
arms than the lawyer at the head of the War Department
at Richmond assumed to undo his work by an
order which Jackson obeyed as a soldier, but bitterly
resented as a strategist baffled by the ignorance and
arrogant assumption of his civilian superior officer.
His letter to Governor Letcher which follows sufficiently
explains the matter:</p>

<p>Let the reader imagine if he can, a lawyer utterly
unskilled in military affairs and completely unacquainted
with even the topography of the valley, sitting
in Richmond, and undertaking not only to direct
the movements of troops in that region but to cancel
and reverse the orders of Stonewall Jackson without
so much as asking his opinion of a situation which that
:Napoleonic commander had painfully wrought out
with inadequate means and in face of difficulties that
might well have appalled even his resolute spirit. Such
imagining will help to a comprehension of the peculiar
difficulties at that time needlessly thrown in the way
of the men to whom was assigned the task of conducting
the war to a successful conclusion. The like
thing was a familiar story on both sides at that period
of the war, and it cost both sides many thousands of
human lives and many millions of treasure.</p>
<p>These are not pleasant facts for the historian to
record, but they must be set down if the story of the

<pb id="VAC0885-374" n="368"/>

war is to be told with truth and in a fashion to be
understood.</p>
<p>Not only did Judah P. Benjamin, the unmilitary
lawyer who held the post of Secretary of War, assume
to interfere with Jackson's dispositions of his troops
without consulting Jackson; his arrogance had an
even more astounding manifestation. Jackson was
acting in the valley under the command of his superior
officer, General Joseph E. Johnston, who had sent
him thither, who trusted him implicitly, and who very
wisely and properly left to his trained skill and well-
approved judgment every detail of a campaign, the
general purport of which was all that even Johnston,
as commanding general, responsible for results, assumed
the right to dictate to such a man as Jackson.
Benjamin, the lawyer Secretary of War, was so far
ignorant or negligent of those forms and courtesies
of military life upon which military success very
largely depends that he sent his order directly to Jackson,
instead of sending it, as common courtesy and all
military usage properly required, through Jackson's
commander, General Johnston. This seriously endangered
results and it was an affront to Johnston
which that officer would have been fully justified in
resenting with his own resignation. It was something
far worse than an affront. It was an impertinent
interference with Johnston's military plans as well
as with Jackson's--an interference of ignorance with
the activities of knowledge which might easily have
defeated operations of the utmost consequence.</p>
<p>It seems incredible, but it is a fact, that General
Johnston, the officer at that time charged with the

<pb id="VAC0885-375" n="369"/>
                    
supreme command in Virginia, never knew or heard
of the order of the Secretary of War to Stonewall
Jackson, utterly disorganizing his plans and directing
him   to surrender all that he had painfully
achieved of strategic advantage, until Jackson's letter
to Governor Letcher, tendering his resignation in
righteous resentment of the interference and in despair
of accomplishing worthy results under such conditions,
came to General Johnston in the regular
course. For Jackson was far too well educated a
soldier to send his letter, even though it was personal
and was addressed to the Governor of Virginia, otherwise
than through his regular military superiors.</p>
<p>Upon reading that letter and its inclosed communication
to the Secretary of War and learning for the
first time of Benjamin's interference with Jackson's
operations, General Johnston sought to save to the
Confederacy the inestimable services of his great
lieutenant. He wrote to Jackson as follows:</p>

<salute>My Dear Friend:--</salute>

<p>I have just read with profound regret
your letter to the Secretary of War asking to be relieved
from your present command, either by an order to the Virginia
Military Institute or the acceptance of your resignation.
Let me beg you to reconsider this matter. Under ordinary
circumstances a due sense of one's own dignity, as well as
care for professional character and official rights, would
demand such a course as yours. But the character of the
war, the great energy exhibited by the government of the
United States, the danger in which our very existence as an
independent people lies, require sacrifices from us all who
have been educated as soldiers. <hi rend="i">I receive my information of
the order of which you have such cause to complain from
your letter. Is not that as great an official wrong to me as
the order itself to you?</hi> Let us dispassionately reason with

<pb id="VAC0885-376" n="370"/>
                    
the government on this subject of command, and if we fail
to influence its practice, then ask to be relieved from positions
<hi rend="i">the authority of which is exercised by the War
Department while the responsibilities are left to us."</hi><ref id="ref_006" rend="super" target="note_006">1</ref></p>
<p>I have taken the liberty to detain your letter, to make this
appeal to your patriotism, not merely from warm feelings of
personal regard but from the official opinion which makes
me regard you as necessary to the service of your country
in your present position.</p>

</p>
                    
<p>General Johnston's appeal to Jackson to continue
in the service in spite of the ignorant, embarrassing,
and grossly ill-mannered interference with his operations
by the Secretary of War, was supported by a
multitude of letters and appeals from statesmen, citizens,
generals and common soldiers--many of the
latter being men of high social and political distinction
who had enlisted in the ranks in a war that all
regarded as their own, but whose enlistment had in no
wise invalidated their right to speak with authority as
representative citizens.</p>
<p>Governor Letcher went at once to the War Department
to plead with Secretary Benjamin for the
saving of Stonewall Jackson's genius and devotion to
the Confederate cause. Benjamin so far yielded as
to hold open the question of Jackson's resignation.
He had not intended to provoke that. It is doubtful
that he would have dared it. He had not intended
anything, indeed, except to impress his own authority

<note id="note_006"><ref target="ref_006" rend="super">1</ref><p>The italics are inserted by the author of this work to emphasize
the peculiar stupidity that on both sides in the war permitted
ignorance to overrule knowledge and self-assumption to dominate
skill. This particular interference came near depriving Lee of the
superb genius of Stonewall Jackson as Halleck's interference well nigh
lost Grant to the Federal army.</p></note>

<pb id="VAC0885-377" n="371"/>
                    
upon the army. When he understood how great a
loss Jackson would be to the cause, and how narrowly
his own grossly irregular interference with Jackson
had missed compelling the resignations of Beauregard,
Johnston, and a host of others in high and low
position, Mr. Benjamin became placative in an extreme
degree.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile he had sacrificed all that Jackson's
energy and genius had accomplished in the Valley
and had discouraged the army in a degree and to
an extent for which no later efficiency could by any
possibility atone. Until Benjamin interfered with
him Jackson was master of the Valley, and of all that
its possession signified, by virtue of his painful endeavors
to achieve that highly desirable result by
means of arduous campaigns in snow and sleet and
slush and mud. If he had been let alone Jackson
would have been in undisputed command of the upper
Potomac country; he would have had Maryland
and southern Pennsylvania thenceforth always at his
mercy; and with reinforcements that might at any
moment have been sent to him he would have been in
position to threaten Washington in a way possibly to
compel the instant withdrawal of McClellan's army
from Richmond and the recall of McDowell's from
Fredericksburg.</p>
<p>As it was, it was left to Lee to achieve those purposes
in much more arduous ways and at cost of great
and otherwise needless battles, involving the loss of
human lives by tens of thousands, where but for ignorant
interference no considerable loss at all would
have been necessary.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-378" n="372"/>

<p>Let us make this matter clear. If Jackson had
been let alone in the Valley, of which he had made
himself complete master, his way would have been
easily open to the region in rear of Washington.
With the opening of the spring of 1862 practically
the whole of Johnston's army, then still at Manassas
and Centerville, together with the troops at
Richmond reinforced from the seaboard and the
South, could have been pushed by the valley route
into Maryland, threatening Washington, Baltimore,
Philadelphia and the North. If that had been done
McClellan would not have been permitted by his government
to advance up the Peninsula. His entire
force would have been held at Washington or sent
northward and westward to meet the Confederate
advance. It would have been Washington, the Federal
capital, and not Richmond, the seat of Confederate
government, that was besieged.</p>
<p>But the interference of a civilian war department
spoiled the program and made a mess of the campaign.
It resulted in a siege of Richmond which
sorely discouraged not only the Confederates but also
their friends in Europe who were struggling to secure
the South's recognition as an independent power.
It rendered necessary the Seven Days' battles presently
to be considered, and the campaign against
Pope, as damaging and depleting preliminaries to a
campaign of aggression which, but for the War Department's
interference, would have been undertaken
with the full force of the Confederate army, unimpaired
by the losses of nearly a dozen battle conflicts.</p>
<p>Jackson's services were fortunately saved to the

<pb id="VAC0885-379" n="373"/>

Confederates. His position in the valley was impaired
by the order of the Secretary of War, which he
obeyed in spite of its destructiveness, and the results
of his arduous campaign there were largely sacrificed
to the fetish of official authority. But at any rate
Jackson's energy and genius were not lost to the cause
to which he was so ardently devoted. Johnston's appeal
and a multitude of others that poured in upon
him overcame the great general's reluctance to continue
longer in a service in which crass ignorance was
permitted to interfere with and destroy the results of
military skill and heroic endeavor.</p>
<p>A week after his resignation was written Jackson,
overwhelmed by appeals to remain in the service,
wrote to Governor Letcher as follows:</p>

you are authorized to withdraw my resignation unless the
Secretary of War desires that it should be accepted. My
reasons for resigning were set forth in my letter of the

</p>

<p>This then was the situation. Stonewall Jackson,
with a miserably inferior force, was holding the Valley
throughout a long winter, and detaining there a

<pb id="VAC0885-380" n="374"/>
                    
Federal army, which, if it had been added to the main
Federal force, would have made that force irresistible
in numbers of men and guns. Toilsomely, and at
cost of desperately hard marching and fighting, he
had made himself master of the strategic position.
He could now hold the Valley secure even with his
inadequate force, and in the event of reinforcement he
could threaten Washington in ways that must compel
the diversion of decisive Federal forces from the
march upon Richmond. His strategy had been masterly,
his enterprise matchless, and his achievements
astonishing in their completeness.</p>                    
<p>Just as these results were achieved a lawyer who
happened to be Secretary of War, without any adequate
knowledge of the military situation, without
any skill in the art of war, without consultation with
Jackson and even without sending his orders through
Jackson's commanding officer, Johnston, assumed to
order Jackson to undo all his work and withdraw his
forces from points of commanding importance which
had been won with difficulty and at cost of positively
heroic sacrifice.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that a war so blunderingly conducted
by ignorant civilians on both sides was prolonged
to four times the length it ought properly to
have endured? Is it any wonder that under such ignorant
direction the war cost scores of thousands of
lives needlessly sacrificed by mismanagement, and
hundreds of millions of needlessly expended treasure?</p>
<p>These details, which seem at first glance, to belong
rather to biography than to history, are set forth here,
precisely as those touching Grant's restraint from

<pb id="VAC0885-381" n="375"/>
                    
activity by Halleck and Farragut's embarrassment by a
civilian Navy Department, are set forth in other chapters
of this history, because they serve to show how
the war was conducted on both sides in those early
years. As influences that caused the prolongation of
the struggle and added enormously to its cost both in
precious treasure and in more precious human life,
they have a historical meaning wholly out of proportion
to their biographical significance.</p>
<p>Jackson remained in command in the Valley. He
had a meager force,--usually less than one fourth that
of his adversary,--and in spite of his activity in battle
at Kernstown, Romney and the rest--his original
plans having been brought to naught by the interference
of the Secretary of War--he was slowly beaten
back into positions that seemed to make of the Valley
a Federal possession.</p>
<p>Then he turned about and by one of the most brilliant
campaigns of all the war, reversed conditions,
and made himself again master where he had seemed
to be almost hopelessly on the defensive.</p>
<p>In preparation for that campaign he earnestly
begged Lee for reinforcements--Lee being then in
general command of the Confederate forces--and
all that Lee could do was to assign to his command
the little force under Edward Johnson west of
Staunton, with the privilege of calling to his aid such
troops as General Ewell had with him on the line
of the Rappahannock, east of the Blue Ridge. His
own immediate command, together with Ewell's and
Edward Johnson's, amounted in all to a little less than
17,000 men, divided into three widely separated columns

<pb id="VAC0885-382" n="376"/>

with the Blue Ridge and a whole day's march
between his own position and that of his chief lieutenant.
Opposed to him were Banks at Harrisonburg
with 19,000 men,--or more than Jackson's total possible
strength--Milroy and Schenck lying to the west
of Staunton with 6,000 men and Fremont advancing
from West Virginia with 9,000 more.</p>
<p>In brief, by concentrating all his widely scattered
forces, Jackson could bring to bear upon his problem
no more than 17,000 men at the very most, while he
stood beleaguered by no less than 384,000, under generals
who already held the greater part of the valley
and seemed easily able to occupy the rest of it, including
Staunton and the chief railroad lines, at will.</p>
<p>When Jackson definitely learned that he could have
no other help than that of Ewell and Edward Johnson,
he boldly planned to concentrate his 17,000 men
and with them make war upon his 384,000 adversaries.
His hope lay in secrecy and celerity of operation. His
plan was to bring the three widely separated parts of
his army together without the enemy's knowledge,
and to hurl the whole like a thunderbolt against one
after another of his enemy's divisions.</p>
<p>The largest of those divisions,--that under Banks's
personal command at Harrisonburg--outnumbered
Jackson's total force by all of 2,000 men, while the
other two divisions were nearly enough equal to his
own to make an assault upon either of them perilous.
Moreover the geographical problem was such that
Jackson could at no point bring all his inferior force
to bear at once. He must always keep a considerable
part of it detached and out of action. lest his 

<pb id="VAC0885-383" n="377"/>

adversary seize upon a position of commanding importance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this truly Napoleonic commander
planned a campaign in which, with his 17,000 men, he
should defend Staunton and destroy in detail his 
adversary's double numbers.</p>
<p>Thus began that campaign whose strategy has been
called by a historian "massive thimble-rigging," because
its success depended upon Jackson's ability to
conceal his movements and make sudden appearances
in quite unexpected places.</p>
<p>The season was highly unfavorable for rapid
marchings. The roads were quagmires and the fields
on either side of the highways were morasses. Sometimes
it was impossible, even by the most heroic endeavors,
to move the guns more than five miles in a
day. Rain and mud offered obstacles immeasurably
more obstinate than hostile battalions, but in spite of
all, Jackson persisted.</p>
<p>His first purpose was to unite the force under his
own immediate command at Swift Run Gap, with
the troops under Edward Johnson at West View,
west of Staunton and forty miles or more away. He
began by ordering Ewell, with his 8,000 men, to cross
the Blue Ridge from the east, and occupy Swift Run
Gap. While Ewell was executing this movement
Jackson, with his 6,000 men and with the purpose
of deceiving his enemy, moved northward down the
valley, turned eastward, crossed the mountains to
their eastern side, and then by a circuitous route made
his way back again westward across the mountains
to join Edward Johnson west of Staunton. His purpose

<pb id="VAC0885-384" n="378"/>
                    
in all this was to convince his enemy that he was
abandoning and evacuating the Valley and marching
to join the Confederate forces defending Richmond.</p>
<p>He accomplished that deception perfectly, and so
secretly was his return to the Valley conducted that
the pushing of his column into Staunton astonished
the Confederates there quite as much as it would have
astonished the Federals if they had known of it, as
they did not.</p>
<p>Ewell, had in the meanwhile, crossed the Blue
Ridge and occupied the position left by Jackson in
the Elk Run valley. Unfortunately for Jackson, that
position must be held at all hazards, and so it was 
impossible for him, for the present at least, to add
Ewell's 8,000 men to the meager forces with which he
intended to assail the Federals farther west.</p>
<p>Thus Jackson's campaign was begun with only
Edward Johnson's force, numbering a scant 3,000
men, and his own battalions, amounting to 6,000, or
somewhat less. He had in all a force of about 8,500
men or perhaps a trifle more, with which to deal with
Milroy and Schenck, who had 6,000 men at McDowell,
the much larger forces of Fremont advancing
from the west, and such reinforcements as Banks
might choose to send to them from his army of 19,000
men at Harrisonburg.</p>
<p>A glance at a map of the Valley will show the
reader clearly that in assailing Milroy and Schenck,
Jackson in fact invited battle with all of Fremont's
and Banks's forces--in other words, that with 9,000
men he risked and boldly challenged a conflict with
no less than 34,000. But so careful and so masterly

<pb id="VAC0885-385" n="379"/>

had his dispositions been that the chance of such a
concentration against him amounted to scarcely more
than zero. For Ewell with his 8,000 men was at Elk
Run, and Ewell was an enterprising officer, greatly
given to fighting upon the smallest provocation.
Had Banks detached any considerable part of his
force from the Harrisonburg position to aid Milroy
and Schenck, Ewell would very certainly have moved
to the conquest of Harrisonburg, and the success of
such a movement would have meant of necessity the
quick reconquering of the whole valley by the Confederates.</p>
<p>Reckoning upon this Jackson joined Johnson and
together they fell upon the Federals at McDowell,
where a small but severe battle ensued on the eighth
of May, in which after four hours of determined
fighting the Federals were driven from the field and
compelled, during the succeeding night, to withdraw
from their position at McDowell, and fall back, the
Confederates closely pursuing them. The retreat
lasted for several days and was marked by some picturesque
incidents.</p>
<p>Schenck, though beaten in battle and driven into
retreat, was still formidable and the fighting quality
of his men had not been impaired. Jackson feared
that the force retreating before him might be reinforced
from Banks's strong army at Harrisonburg.
In that case it would turn again and rend him. But
the reinforcements, if sent at all, must be sent through
certain narrow and heavily-wooded defiles, and to
check their advance Jackson sent out detachments to
obstruct those passageways by felling timber across

<pb id="VAC0885-386" n="380"/>
                    
them. He also asked the aid of the farmers in such
work and right willingly they responded.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Schenck protected his retreat
from too close a pursuit by setting fire to the dense
woods and literally stifling his enemy with smoke.
Jackson's men found it sometimes impossible to go
forward without actual suffocation and so Schenck
gained time in which to effect his retreat.</p>
<p>The destruction of superb timber, the growth of
fifty or a hundred years, which the operations of both
the contestants involved, was only a small part of that
waste which makes war the most costly of all human
arbitraments.</p>
<p>Human lives are of course more precious in many
ways than forest growths, but human life is easily and
quickly reproduced, while a forest destroyed upon
steep mountain sides is so much of God's good gift to
man forever taken away.</p>
<p>Jackson had now completely accomplished his purpose
of driving Schenck back upon Fremont. He
had no desire to press on and bring about a battle with
the united forces of the two in the difficult mountain
country. He had effectually prevented a junction of
Fremont or Schenck with Banks's army at Harrisonburg.
He had prevented the capture of Staunton by
the Federals, thus protecting the railroad connections
of the Confederates, and he had kept between thirty
and forty thousand Federal troops busy in the Valley.
who might otherwise have been sent to reinforce
McClellan.</p>
<p>Still more important, his operations had compelled
the Federal Government to stop the advance of

<pb id="VAC0885-387" n="381"/>

McDowell's army by way of Fredericksburg and thus to
deprive McClellan, assailing Richmond, of a reinforcement
which might have rendered his assault absolutely
irresistible.</p>
<p>Jackson's next necessity was to unite his meager
force with the column of Ewell which was posted at
Elk Run for the double purpose of threatening
Banks at Harrisonburg and standing ready to march
at a moment's warning to the assistance of the 
beleaguered garrison at Richmond. It was the grandest
of grand strategy that Jackson was engaged in, and
it was directed by the masterful genius of Robert E.
Lee, acting through and by the genius of Stonewall
Jackson.</p>
<p>Milroy and Schenck had been dislodged from the
positions that threatened Staunton. They had been
driven westward. They had also been effectually cut
off for the time at least from a possible junction with
Banks. So Jackson decided to effect the speediest
possible junction between his own force in the field
and Ewell's command of 8,000 men at Elk Run valley,
and with the force thus concentrated to assail
Banks at Harrisonburg. He hoped by a precipitate
movement to defeat Banks before Fremont, whose
plans of campaign he had so greatly interfered with,
could come to that general's assistance.</p>
<p>But Banks did not wait for Jackson. In face of .
the fact that his 19,000 men at Harrisonburg outnumbered
the whole of Jackson's widely scattered forces,
Banks retreated northward down the Valley as soon
as Jackson began his campaign. On the first of May
he evacuated Harrisonburg and slowly retired to

<pb id="VAC0885-388" n="382"/>
                    
Newmarket. There he lost more than half his force
by the detachment of Shields with 11,000 men, who
moved on May 12, by way of Luray and Front Royal
to join the force at Fredericksburg, thus emphasizing
that threat to Richmond which it was Jackson's function
to divert.</p>
<p>So far Jackson's strategy was unsuccessful. He
had defeated Schenck and Milroy. He had prevented
a junction of their forces with those of Banks; but
he had not prevented Banks from sending 11,000
men and a proportionate number of guns to strengthen
the column at Fredericksburg which was intended
to join McClellan before Richmond and to render
him irresistible.</p>
<p>From  Newmarket Banks continued his retreat
down the valley--northward--until he rested at Strasburg
and Front Royal.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the administration at Washington,
nervously and even absurdly apprehensive as it
was, plucked up courage enough to order McDowell,
with the army at Fredericksburg, reinforced by
Shields with 11,000 men, to march on the twenty-
sixth across country by way of the Richmond and
Fredericksburg railroad, and join McClellan's right
wing before Richmond.</p>
<p>Timidity itself could not have hesitated to consent
to this movement. It placed an army of more than
40,000 men in front of Washington and between that
capital and the Confederate forces of 60,000 men or
less, that McClellan was already beleaguering at
Richmond with 120,000 men, while it left Banks in
the Valley with 8,000 and the easy support of Fremont's


<pb id="VAC0885-389" n="383"/>

15,000 men to check any movement that Jackson
might make upon Washington with his force of
not more than 15,000 or 16,000.</p>
<p>Yet so great was the apprehension felt at Washington
for the safety of that city that when the time
came, Lee played upon it with success and by his play
upon it deprived McClellan of reinforcements from
McDowell, Banks and Fremont, aggregating nearly
65,000 men.</p>
<p>Turning about, after his pursuit of Schenck, Jackson
quickly formed a junction of his own force with
Well's, and with 16,000 or 17,000 men turned upon
Banks, who was now retreating down the Valley
toward Strasburg. He struck first at a detachment
at Front Royal which he surprised and almost completely
destroyed on the twenty-third of May.</p>
<p>On the twenty-fourth Banks decided to abandon
Strasburg and retreat to Winchester, destroying his
stores and such wagons of his train as he could not
save from capture. Jackson's cavalry destroyed a
multitude more of them on march, throwing the Federal
trains into the utmost confusion. Jackson now
had a much stronger force than Banks--about three
men indeed to Banks's one.</p>
<p>With his vastly superior force Jackson set out to
obey his orders, which were to "clear the valley and
threaten Washington," so as to compel the diversion
of McDowell's army from 1cClellan's reinforcement
before Richmond.</p>
<p>The task was an inviting one and Jackson accomplished
it promptly. Marching tirelessly, by night as
well as by day, he quickly drove Banks from Strasburg

<pb id="VAC0885-390" n="384"/>

to Middletown and from Middletown to Winchester.
At Winchester he broke Banks's force into
bits in a hotly contested battle, and having cut off the
Federal general's retreat to Harper's Ferry, sent him
flying in confusion by way of Martinsburg to Williamsport
on the upper Potomac. Banks fought
stubbornly against such odds as no commander could
hope to overcome, but finding himself beaten and his
columns disintegrated he skilfully retreated over the
space of thirty-four miles in a single day, and successfully
placed himself behind the Potomac where his
force could threaten Jackson's flank, if the great Confederate
should move upon Washington by way of
Harper's Ferry.</p>
<p>Apart from its brilliant incidents which cannot be
here related in detail Jackson's Valley campaign had
thus far completely accomplished its strategic purpose.
It had detained Fremont and Schenck with
15,000 men in the mountains when McClellan needed
them before Richmond. It had kept Banks busy and
finally had driven him out of the Valley and into a
position from which he could render no assistance to
the Federal armies anywhere. Finally it had so
greatly alarmed the authorities at Washington that
they completely diverted McDowell's 40,000 men
from McClellan's reinforcement, sending the major
part of that force upon the fruitless errand of destroying
Jackson and employing the rest of it in the
direct defense of Washington.</p>
<p>All this was precisely what Robert E. Lee had
planned and intended, and it was perfectly accomplished.
If larger space is here given to an account

<pb id="VAC0885-391" n="385"/>

of this campaign than the size and direct importance
of its battles would seem to justify, it is because of
the tremendous strategic consequences of the operations
involved. Jackson's activity made possible not
only Lee's superb campaign of dislodgment against
McClellan, but all the stupendous campaigning that
followed, including the overthrow of Pope at Manassas,
the invasion of Maryland, the battle of
Antietam, the Fredericksburg battle and the later
Chancellorsville and Gettysburg.</p>
<p>The story of all that will follow in later chapters.
In the meanwhile, it is pleasant to record here one
step forward in civilization which was made during
this campaign and the author of which, Dr. Hunter
McGuire, deserves remembrance for his humanity.
Until that time, and indeed for long afterwards, surgeons
in charge of hospitals full of wounded men,
upon falling into the enemy's hands, were treated as
prisoners of war. After every battle, therefore, the
surgeons of a retiring army, in charge of wounded
men from both sides, must make a hard choice. They
must either abandon their patients--many of whom
were in desperate need of immediate surgical attention,
or they must submit themselves to the rigors and
sufferings of a military imprisonment, precisely as
if they had been taken in battle. As a result of this
peculiar barbarism of war the wounded--by the flight
of their surgeons--were often left unattended at the
critical moment that meant to them the difference between
life and death. Many precious lives were needlessly
sacrificed to this barbaric military practice.</p>
<p>At the battle of Winchester Jackson captured all

<pb id="VAC0885-392" n="386"/>

the Federal surgeons in charge of the field hospitals
there, but instead of sending them to Belle Isle or
Andersonville or Libby Prison, he acted upon the suggestion
of his medical director, Dr. Hunter McGuire,
and released the doctors unconditionally upon the
rational and humane ground that surgeons do not
make war, and ought not to be subjected to war's
pains and penalties, and upon the still more rational
and humane ground that it is needful for the care of
the wounded on both sides that surgeons shall be permitted
to remain at their posts until surgeons on the
other side can replace them, regardless of army movements
and without fear of being sent to a loathsome
prison as a punishment for their faithfulness to their
merciful duty.</p>
<p>This step forward in the amelioration of war's horrors
was not generally followed up until two years
later when, during the tremendous struggle of 1864,
General Lee and General Grant, acting upon their
own humane impulses and with no authority except
the confidence of each that his acts would be approved,
agreed that surgeons in charge of wounded men
should not be made prisoners of war, but should be
subject only to such temporary detention as might be
necessary to prevent them from carrying tidings of
strategic importance across the lines.</p>
<p>It was Dr. Hunter McGuire who first offered this
suggestion in behalf of humanity, and it was Stonewall
Jackson who first took the responsibility of acting
upon it. To their memory history should accord
honor for it.</p>
<p>Jackson's Valley campaign had completely accomplished

<pb id="VAC0885-393" n="387"/>
                    
its chief purpose. It had thrown the War
Department at Washington into a panic which is reflected
in the dispatches of President Lincoln and
Secretary Stanton sent about that time. Neither
McClellan nor McDowell regarded the situation in
any such serious light as that in which it was viewed
by Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Stanton. McClellan and
McDowell were trained and educated soldiers, Mr.
Lincoln and Mr. Stanton were civilians. The two
soldiers perfectly understood that while Jackson had
driven Fremont back into the West Virginia mountains
and had chased Banks to and across the Potomac,
he could not with his meager force--now reduced
to less than 15,000 men--sanely cross into Maryland
or without madness undertake a serious campaign
against Washington. They knew Jackson to be a
perfectly sane man, and hence they did not expect
him to undertake either of those crazy operations.
They were agreed in thinking that the proper course
was for McDowell to push on to Richmond and join
McClellan there before Jackson could add his force
to Lee's.</p>
<p>If they had been permitted to do this, McClellan's
force before the Confederate capital would have been
sufficient, within three or four days, to overpower all
conceivable opposition and to capture Richmond.</p>
<p>But Lee knew how almost insanely the administration
at Washington dreaded every threat against that
city or the country north of it, and he had successfully
counted upon that absurd nervousness to enable
Jackson, with 16,000 or 17,000 men, to neutralize
McDowell's army of 40,000 in the great game then

<pb id="VAC0885-394" n="388"/>
                    
being played for the possession of Richmond. He
had made a zero of Fremont and Schenck in the problem.
He had converted Banks's army into a Potomac
river-picket guard, and he had compelled McDowell's
40,000 men to remain inactive as a garrison defending
Washington.</p>
<p>Never in all the war was so small a force as Jackson's
made to neutralize so large a force. By the
simple virtue of Lee's masterful strategy and Jackson's
extraordinary capacity in execution, 17,000 men
occupied 65,000 and kept them completely out of the
decisive struggle. And as if to add emphasis to
the situation, the 17,000 who had thus paralyzed three
or four times their number, were themselves brought
upon the field before Richmond in time to play their
full part in the critical and decisive actions from which
their previous activity had excluded so great a number
of their opponents.</p>
<p>But the story of the Valley campaign is not yet
fully told. Having driven Fremont back into West
Virginia and Banks beyond the Potomac at Williamsport,
Jackson was ordered by Lee to make a demonstration
threatening an invasion of Maryland and
seeming to threaten an assault upon Washington, by
way of still further disarranging the Federal plans
and diverting Federal forces from the assault upon
Richmond.</p>
<p>Jackson moved at once upon Harper's Ferry and
for a time seemed not only determined but quite easily
able to cross the Potomac there and push forward into
Maryland and Pennsylvania or to sweep with enthusiastic
fury upon Washington itself.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-395" n="389"/>

<p>The result was what Lee had planned that it should
be. Fremont, whose force ought to have been moved
to McClellan's reinforcement, was ordered to advance
from the fastnesses of the West Virginia
mountains into the Valley, there to assail Jackson.
Banks, driven to cover at Williamsport on the Potomac
above Harper's Ferry, was ordered to hold the
crossings there against a possible advance of Jackson
by that route and presently to return to the Valley and
assail Jackson. Saxton, with 7,000 or 8,000 men,
withdrawn from McDowell's army, was sent to hold
the heights about Harper's Ferry and at the proper
time to advance. McDowell's carefully planned
march upon Richmond was suspended and the greater
part of his force was ordered to the Valley. The
purpose was by concurrent action on the part of Fremont
moving from West Virginia, Banks moving
back up the Valley from Williamsport, Saxton's advancing
from the neighborhood of Harper's Ferry,
and McDowell's strong column crossing the Blue
Ridge from Fredericksburg, completely to surround,
overwhelm and destroy Jackson, whose total force
was now reduced to a scant 15,000, while the forces
thus set to the task of making an end of him, aggregated
not less than 55,000 or 60,000 men. It was his
task, with 15,000 men not only to meet and destroy
these forces in detail, so far as that might be done, but
in any case to escape from the trap set for him and
unite his army with that of Lee before Richmond in
time to lend his enthusiasm and his strength to that
assault upon McClellan which was planned for the
immediate future.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-396" n="390"/>

<p>If the reader will look at a map he will see almost
at a glance how perilous a problem Jackson had
to solve. With less than 15,000 men he was threatening
Harper's Ferry and the strongholds round about,
held by Saxton with 7,000 men and eighteen pieces of
artillery. Banks with about 9,000 men was now advancing
from Williamsport to assail him in flank and
rear, and cut off his retreat. Fremont with 10,000 or
15,000 men was advancing from West Virginia and
had by telegraph promised Mr. Lincoln that he would
be in Strasburg--seventeen miles south of Winchester
and commanding Jackson's route of retreat--on
Saturday, May 31. In the meanwhile Shields, commanding
20,000 men from McDowell's army and followed
by McDowell himself with the rest of it, was
hurrying from Fredericksburg into the Valley and
was due at Strasburg by noon of the thirty-first.</p>
<p>In other words four armies, numbering in the aggregate
more than 50,000 men, were threatening to
envelop and overwhelm Jackson. Of these forces no
less than 35,000 men were rapidly concentrating in
Jackson's rear upon the lines over which he must
march in order to escape from the trap set for him
and add his force to Lee's in time for the impending
battle before Richmond.</p>
<p>It was Jackson's problem not only to escape from
these forces, rapidly concentrating to destroy him, but
so far to defeat them in detail with his little army as
to keep them where they were, while moving his own
army to Lee's assistance.</p>
<p>This required grand strategy on a grand scale, and
Jackson responded to the demand with a brilliancy

<pb id="VAC0885-397" n="391"/>

wholly unmatched in any other operation of the war.
Putting aside details that would only serve to confuse
the reader's mind, let us tell in outline the story
of what the great commander of the "foot cavalry"
did in this complex emergency.</p>
<p>First of all, he withdrew his troops hurriedly from
the neighborhood of Harper's Ferry to Winchester.
When he got there he found that McDowell's force
was in possession of Front Royal, only twelve miles
from Strasburg, and Fremont was at Wardensville,
only twenty miles away, while the head of his own
column was eighteen miles distant from the crucial
point, and its rear forty-three miles away. A large
part of his force was footsore and exhausted after
a hurried march of twenty-five miles in a single
day, with frequent skirmishings to punctuate their
progress.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Jackson determined to reach and occupy
Strasburg before his enemies could get there.
He had eighteen miles to go while one of the enemy's
columns had twenty and the other only twelve to
travel. Their combined forces outnumbered his own
about three to one, to say nothing of the 15,000 men
of Banks and Saxton who had been pressing his rear
all day. But he believed it possible for him, reckoning
upon the extraordinary marching qualities of his
men, to reach Strasburg before the enemy's columns
could concentrate there. If he could do that he
counted upon the superb fighting spirit of his men to
overcome the enemy's three detachments by striking
them separately in spite of the fact that one of those
detachments outnumbered him by thirty-three per

<pb id="VAC0885-398" n="392"/>
                    
cent while each of the others nearly or quite equaled
him in numbers.</p>
<p>He acted instantly. His march was incumbered by
2,300 Federal prisoners and an embarrassingly large
train consisting in its major part of wagons loaded
with precious stores which he had captured from the
enemy. But in spite of all he marched all the way to
Strasburg on the 31st of May, while his rear guard
succeeded in passing well beyond Winchester, some
parts of it having covered thirty-five miles since the
morning. The Federals pursuing under Saxton had
stopped at Charlestown, their commander afterwards
reporting that their exhaustion was such as to forbid
a further advance.</p>
<p>Having thus eluded his pursuers, Banks and Saxton,
Jackson pushed his foot cavalry into Strasburg
in advance of both Fremont and Shields, though each
of them had had a much shorter line of march than
his own in order to reach that place. He had shaken
off Banks and Saxton for a time at least, but he had
pushed his small force in between Fremont's equal
army on the one hand and Shields's superior one,
which was now supported by additional troops under
'McDowell's own command, on the other. His problem
was to prevent the junction of these two armies
sent to crush him, to escape them and--if possible--to
defeat them separately. One of these armies outnumbered
his own in the proportion of four men to
three while the other equaled his force. But if he
could keep them separated and attack them in positions
of his own choosing, where they could not both
fight him at once, he did not despair of beating them.</p>


<pb id="VAC0885-399" n="393"/>
                    
<p>McDowell, reckoning upon the easy superiority of
his force, sent detachments hither and yon, to "head
off" Jackson, and prevent his escape, that seeming
now to be the only thing to be done with a fleeing
general whose army was beset on every side, outnumbered,
and hopelessly entangled.</p>
<p>In execution of these orders a whole day was
wasted by Shields, through mistakes as to routes, and
Jackson slipped out of Strasburg on his way to Harrisonburg,
Cross Keys and Port Republic, points at
which he planned to turn upon his enemy and fight
him in detail.</p>
<p>By the burning of bridges and the adroit disposition
of troops in a region broken by mountain ranges
and laced by streams at that time of year unfordable,
Jackson managed to keep the divisions of his adversary
separated as they severally pursued his retreat,
intent upon capturing or destroying him.</p>
<p>So greatly overwhelming were the Federal numbers
that General Shields urgently protested to General
McDowell against the sending of any more men
to his assistance. Says General McDowell in an official
utterance:</p>

<q rend="blockquote">He [Shields] had been in that country before and his
command had suffered somewhat. He wrote me a letter
stating his apprehensions, saying that if troops instead of
supplies kept coming over, the troops would starve, and
asking why I should bring so many there; that he had
enough men to clear the Valley out and for God's sake not to
send him any more men.</q>

<p>McDowell reassured Shields as to the abundance
of supplies and that commander, with his superabundance

<pb id="VAC0885-400" n="394"/>

dance of men, cheerfully undertook the task of "clearing
out the Valley" which seemed to him easy. He
had not adequately reckoned upon the genius of
Stonewall Jackson--that was all.</p>
<p>The "foot cavalry" had now retreated with splendid
success, as far as Jackson intended that they
should. He was pursued by the two armies, but he
had succeeded in keeping them separated by an unfordable
river, while divesting himself of his embarrassing
supply train and his still more embarrassing
company of Federal prisoners. These, together
with his own sick and wounded, he had sent under
escort to Staunton.</p>
<p>Thus, stripped for action, he turned upon his pursuers
to rend them. Fremont's force and that under
Shields were separated by a river. Jackson had destroyed
every bridge that crossed that stream except
the one at Port Republic, which he securely held for
his own use in the contemplated operations. He had
about 13,000 men of all arms available for battle uses.
Fremont, who was hotly pursuing him, had about
11,500, while Shields's force--weakened by detachments--
marching down the other side of the river,
was much smaller, not over three or four thousand
effectives. Exact figures are unattainable.</p>
<p>Jackson had effectually prevented the union of
these two armies. He decided to fight them now, one
at a time.</p>
<p>On the eighth of June, at Cross Keys, a few miles
north of Port Republic, he turned upon Fremont.
He was forced to reduce his firing line heavily by detaching
a part of his little army to hold Shields in

<pb id="VAC0885-401" n="395"/>

check on the other side of the river, and another part
to hold Port Republic and the bridge which constituted
his communication. He posted the remainder
of his troops in a position of his own choosing and
there awaited Fremont's attack.</p>
<p>That attack was made on the eighth of June and
was repulsed with so much ease and so much completeness,
that Jackson at once decided to assail his
other adversary, Shields, in the hope of defeating him
in his turn. Leaving a sufficient force on Fremont's
side of the river to hold that general in check, or, if
need be to destroy the bridge and prevent his crossing,
he withdrew his battalions and precipitately assailed
Shields, falling upon him in Napoleonic fashion with
the head of his own column and trusting to expeditious
marching for the coming up of reinforcements
in time to prevent a possible failure from maturing
into a disaster.</p>
<p>Shields resisted so valiantly and so stubbornly that
Jackson's advance corps was very nearly overthrown,
but in the end the Confederate commander brought
a superior force to bear and completely crushed
Shields's defense.</p>
<p>Immediately Fremont and Shields gave up the
contest and retreated northward down the Valley,
while Jackson rested his army preparatory to a hurried
march to join Lee before Richmond while the
fear of him should continue to hold Fremont's and
McDowell's and Banks's, and what had been Saxton's,
forces in the Valley.</p>
<p>For that march and junction Lee had fully prepared.
He secretly sent instructions to Jackson to

<pb id="VAC0885-402" n="396"/>

march at once to Ashland, a dozen miles from Richmond,
and thence sweep down between the Pamunkey
and Chickahominy rivers, in aid of Lee's own movement
against McClellan. Then he ordered two divisions
ostentatiously detached from the army before
Richmond, to go to Jackson's reinforcement in the
Valley, and directed Jackson to do all he could to
impress the enemy with the belief that he was planning,
with a strongly reinforced army, to sweep down
the Valley again and press on into Maryland, threatening
Washington and Baltimore. Pains were taken
to impress the fact of Jackson's strong reinforcement
upon Federal officers who, as prisoners, were about to
be paroled and sent north and they carried the news,
as it was meant that they should do. The deception
was so complete that even while Jackson was actively
assailing McClellan's rear on the Chickahominy a
few days later, General Banks was sending from the
Valley dispatches warning the Washington authorities
that Stonewall Jackson was preparing immediately
to sweep down the Valley at the head of a
reinforced and now quite irresistible army.</p>
<p>The result was that Jackson and the divisions sent
ostensibly to reinforce him, joined Lee in front of
Richmond in time to aid in the Seven Days' battles
for McClellan's dislodgment.</p>

<p>It was explained in the last chapter that Lee's first
object when he took personal charge of the army defending
Richmond was to raise McClellan's siege of
the Confederate capital, drive him away, and transfer
the scene of active operations to some more distant
field.</p>
<p>To that end, first of all, he had strengthened the
army at Richmond by calling to it every man that
could be spared from coast defense and from the
regions farther south. Next he had set Jackson at
work in the Valley, to occupy the forces there and in
West Virginia, and by threatening Washington to
divert from McClellan's reinforcement an additional
army of 40,000 men which had been intended to
strengthen him into irresistibility.</p>
<p>When Jackson, beset by four armies, had escaped
from two of them and had defeated the other two,
Lee sent strong reinforcements to him in a conspicuous
way, so that he might seem about to advance down
the Valley, cross the Potomac and in strong force
occupy the region north of the Potomac and threaten
the capture of Washington itself.</p>
<p>By this strategy Lee had managed to detain 65,000
Federals in the Valley, and 20,000 or 30,000 more in
and around Washington, whose fighting force must

<pb id="VAC0885-404" n="398"/>

otherwise have been added to McClellan's already
superior army before Richmond. Then he had managed
to have Jackson suddenly and secretly quit the
Valley, with the force that had there achieved such
spectacular results, together with the troops that had
been ostensibly sent to reinforce him for an aggressive
campaign and by a rapid movement to join the
army at Richmond and assist it in a supreme endeavor
to dislodge McClellan.</p>
<p>The situation then was this: Relying upon a reinforcement
of 40,000 men under McDowell, McClellan
had dangerously divided his army, keeping
about half of it north and about half of it south of
the Chickahominy river. His desire was to press forward
his siege operations on the east of the Confederate
capital and at the same time to maintain a threatening
force north of the city. It was his purpose so
soon as McDowell should add his 40,000 men to this
army on the north, to sweep forward with the combined
forces and irresistibly to push a conquering
column into Richmond.</p>
<p>But Lee had baffled all these plans by his masterful
strategy. He had compelled the diversion of McDowell
to the Valley, and while the authorities at Washington
were nervously expecting Jackson to swoop down
upon that city, Jackson with his whole force, which
had slipped out of the Valley, suddenly appeared at
Ashland, about a dozen miles northwest of Richmond
and immediately upon McClellan's right flank.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Lee had sent Stuart--perhaps the
most daring and enterprising of the Southern cavalry
leaders--with a body of 1,200 or 1,500 horsemen and

<pb id="VAC0885-405" n="399"/>
                    
two guns, to the rear of McClellan's position, there to
find out the disposition of troops, the condition of the
roads and bridges, and whatever else might open the
way to that gigantic operation of offensive defense
which Lee intended presently to undertake.</p>
<p>Stuart moved promptly into McClellan's rear and
swept around it like a whirlwind. Finding that a
tardy resistance was taking the form of an organized
effort to cut off his retreat by the route over which
he had come, the gaily enterprising cavalier of the
South, instead of turning back and trying to retrace
his steps as his enemy expected him to do, decided to
ride on all the way around McClellan's army and
thus spectacularly to emphasize the imperfection of
McClellan's precaution for the protection of that rear
which Lee was planning presently to assail tempestuously.
He rode completely around McClellan, crossing
his line of communications, rebuilding a bridge
which had been destroyed for the purpose of cutting
him off and entrapping him, and returning to Richmond
with a loss so small as to be scarcely worthy of
mention in an official report.</p>
<p>This raid was made on the twelfth and thirteenth
of June, and equipped with the detailed information
secured by it Lee planned to assail McClellan on the
twenty-sixth of June with a force sufficient to dislodge
him from his besieging positions, to break his
line of communication and supply by way of the
White House on the York river, and to compel his
retreat from the front of the Confederate capital to
some point on the James river, where his gunboats
could afford him needed protection.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-406" n="400"/>
                    
<p>For the purposes of this operation Lee had a force
somewhat inferior in men and guns to McClellan's,
but not greatly inferior. On the other hand McClellan's
army was badly placed, with half of it on
the north and half of it on the south of the Chickahominy,
neither half being within easy supporting distance
of the other, while the line of communication
and supply by way of the White House was peculiarly
vulnerable in case of an attack from the rear.</p>
<p>Reckoning upon these advantages, it was Lee's
plan to have Jackson move down from Ashland, assail
McClellan's right wing in flank and rear, drive back
his forces and thus open the crossings of the river to
the other Confederate corps, which were to cross one
after the other and assail the enemy in front while
Jackson should attack him in rear and flank.</p>
<p>The plan miscarried in part. For once Jackson
was not on time, and, after waiting for him until the
afternoon of the twenty-seventh of June A. P. Hill
grew impatient of the delay, and pushed his corps
across the river at Meadow Bridge and, after a strenuous
fight, drove the Federals out of Mechanicsville,
without any help from Jackson. Longstreet and D.
H. Hill at the lower crossings also grew impatient of
delay, and without waiting for orders crossed and engaged
the enemy. On the next morning Jackson was
with them and he led the advance.</p>
<p>The plan of battle was that Jackson, with D. H.
Hill for support, and keeping well in rear of McClellan's
fortified positions, should push rapidly forward
towards the York-river railroad, which constituted
McClellan's sole line of communication and

<pb id="VAC0885-407" n="401"/>

supply, while A. P. Hill and Longstreet, advancing
upon Jackson's right, should attack McClellan in
flank, front and rear whenever he might seriously
oppose Jackson's movement.</p>
<p>There was some further miscarriage of plans, and
in consequence of a delay in Jackson's advance Longstreet
and Hill fell upon the right wing of McClellan's
army posted in a strong strategic position
at Gaines's Mills before the advance under Jackson
was ready to strike its blow.</p>
<p>The Confederates here encountered a very obstinate
resistance and they were not able to force the position
until Jackson came up and joined in the assault.
It was a critical moment of the war. Had McClellan
been able to hold this position the Confederate
campaign of offense must have completely collapsed,
and with a superior force, the Federal general would
have been free to conquer Richmond at that leisure
which his engineering soul so greatly loved.</p>
<p>But with Jackson's force added to the commands of
Longstreet and Hill, the Confederates, after a very
determined and bloody contest, drove the Federals
from their position and made themselves prospective
masters of McClellan's sole line of communication
with his only depot of supplies at the White House.</p>
<p>There was nothing now for McClellan to do but
retreat as best he could to the James river at Harrison's
Landing and make that, instead of the White
House, a base of supplies. To do that was exceedingly
difficult, as McClellan had open to him only one
road and that a very bad one, while the Confederates
on his flank had many roads by which to intercept and
annoy his retreat.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-408" n="402"/>

<p>During the course of that retreat, which was attended
at every step by bloody contests, McClellan
wrote in great bitterness of spirit to the Secretary of
War in Washington (Mr. Stanton) on the twenty-eighth
of June: "If I save this army now, I tell you
plainly that I owe no thanks to you or to any other
persons in Washington [obviously meaning Mr. Lincoln].
You have done your best to sacrifice this
army."</p>
<p>McClellan, with an overwhelmingly superior force,
had invested Richmond on the east and north. There
he had strongly fortified himself. He had pushed his
advance to within four miles of the Confederate capital.
He had brought up tremendous siege guns and
had apparently made himself complete master of the
situation. Then Jackson, the two Hills, Longstreet
and Ewell, under direction of Robert E. Lee, had
fallen upon his flank and rear and had driven him out
of one position after another with fearful slaughter,
until his White House communication was cut off,
and nothing remained to him but retreat to a new base
on James river. The Confederates confidently calculated
upon cutting off that retreat also and compelling
the surrender of an army superior to their
own in numbers, arms, resources and everything else
except fighting ability.</p>
<p>This they would very probably have accomplished
if McClellan had not developed in answer to a pressing
need a fighting quality which he had not before
shown, and his army a resolute determination to endure
punishment such as none but the best of veterans
are expected to show.</p>

<pb  id="VAC0885-409" n="403"/>

<p>McClellan's one hope, one purpose, was to march
his army out of the swamps and escape from the
ceaseless Confederate assaults to a point on James
river where the resistless fire of the gunboats might
protect his men from further attack and give them a
chance to rest. To that end, he retreated night and
day, standing at bay now and then as the hunted stag
does, and fighting desperately for the poor privilege
of running away.</p>
<p>And the splendid fighting of his men was a tribute
to the skill and genius with which he had created an
effective army out of what he had described as "regiments
cowering upon the banks of the Potomac, some
perfectly raw, others dispirited by recent defeat,
others going home." Out of a demoralized and disorganized
mass reinforced by utterly untrained civilians,
McClellan had within a few months created an army
capable of stubbornly contesting every inch of ground
even while effecting a retreat the very thought of
which might well have disorganized an army. For
soldiers in retreat do not usually fight as soldiers do
when advancing upon an enemy. They are apt to be
filled with the sentiment of hopelessness which retreat
suggests and to hesitate to risk their lives in contests
that seem to offer no adequate return for sacrifice.</p>
<p>If McClellan conspicuously failed as an energetic
commander, in this his first important campaign, he
succeeded at any rate in demonstrating the perfection
of that work of organization by means of which he
had created the splendid Army of the Potomac out
of raw recruits and panic-stricken fugitives from
battle.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-410" n="404"/>

<p>At Gaines's Mill they gallantly endured a loss of
no less than 9,000 men, and while they were driven
from their position at last, they lost nothing of their
morale, but were ready two days later to fight an
equally determined battle, though it was the battle of
a beaten and broken army which had been driven by
force out of a supremely advantageous position and
was now seeking safety in a flight that knew no
ceasing night or day, except now and then a pause to
offer a sullen resistance to an ever-present and pressing
foe, and to ward off complete destruction by the
offer of battle wherever the ground gave opportunity
for resistance.</p>
<p>Here was McClellan's reward; here was his glory.
This army of his a few months earlier under such a
succession of defeats would have broken into panic-
stricken rout. Thanks solely to his discipline and his
dominant influence, it now endured compulsory and
disastrous retreat with fortitude and stubbornly contested
every inch of the blood-soaked ground.</p>
<p>It outnumbered Lee's force and its equipment was
immeasurably superior to his. Under a commander of
high gift for field work it might perhaps have beaten
Lee and forced its triumphant way into Richmond.
Under the commander it had it did itself great honor
by retreating in good order and stubbornly resisting
the Confederate advance wherever it was permitted
to do so.</p>
<p>McClellan being now in full retreat and considering
only those problems which related to escape, abandoned
the position at Fair Oaks and posted Sumner
and Heintzelman at Savage's Station. Their sole

<pb id="VAC0885-411" n="405"/>

function was to guard the flank of the hurriedly retreating
Federal army. To that end they were ordered
to defend the position at Savage's Station until
nightfall, or, in other words, until McClellan's retreating
army should have passed that point in its
hurried flight.</p>
<p>Here the Confederates under Magruder attacked
with fury and the Federal general Heintzelman was
driven into retreat. But Sumner heroically held his
ground until nightfall, thus accomplishing McClellan's
purpose, though at cost of a fearful loss in
killed and wounded. He was so hard pressed indeed
that when he retired at nightfall, he was forced to
leave all his wounded in the enemy's hands and make
a precipitate retreat to avoid the capture of his entire
force.</p>
<p>Fortunately his enemy was a civilized one, so that
his wounded men, left in their hands, were as tenderly
cared for as if Federal surgeons had had them in
charge. The only difference was that Federal surgeons
had all possible medicaments and surgical appliances,
while the Confederates, by reason of the blockade,
lacked many life-saving agents, particularly the
quinine which men wounded after long campaigning
in the Chickahominy and White Oak swamps needed
as imperatively as a shipwrecked crew needs life-lines
and breeches-buoys. The war was so far civilized that
the surgeons on either side eagerly did their best for
such of the enemy's wounded as might fall into their
hands. But it was still so far savage,--and it remained
so to the end--that the side which possessed
a navy shut out from the other as contraband of war

<pb id="VAC0885-412" n="406"/>

the medicines necessary to the saving of human life
and the rescue of the wounded from a needless death,
as resolutely as it shut out gunpowder itself. In
other words, the blockade was to this extent a part of
that savagery which makes war upon the sick and
wounded and other non-combatants as determinedly
as it does upon stalwart men with guns in their hands
and cartridge boxes strapped around their waists.
There is cruelly no room for doubt that during the
Seven Days' battles thousands of gallant fellows on
both sides were buried in the fetid mud of those
swamps, who might have been saved, had the world
then been civilized enough for the Federals to let the
Confederates have the quinine, the calomel and the
opium they needed for the salvation of the lives of
those who could fight no more, whether Federal or
Confederate in their allegiance.</p>
<p>No nation is even yet civilized enough for this.
"War is all Hell," said General Sherman, and its hellishness
is nowhere so aggressively manifest as when it
denies to a hard-pressed adversary the medicines necessary
to the salvation of human life, the rescue from
death of those who are already incapacitated, either
by wounds or by disease, from further fighting. It
is quite legitimate and logical to forbid the sending of
food supplies to your enemy, because food is the foundation
of every army's resisting power. But when a
starving army surrenders, as Lee's did at Appomattox,
the first care of its conqueror is to issue rations
to the men who have ceased to fight, as Grant issued
them on that historic occasion, even before the terms
of capitulation could be written out. But it is a very

<pb id="VAC0885-413" n="407"/>

different and a very much more barbarous thing to
deny to surgeons in the field the means of saving human
life whether the subjects of such life-saving
happen to belong to the one army or to the other.
The people of the United States are to-day paying
princely sums as pensions to the families of those who
died under Confederate surgeons' hands simply because
the laws and usages of war forbade to those
surgeons the medicines necessary to their life-saving
work, and treated life-saving appliances as they
treated gunpowder and arms, as contraband of war.
Why should this hideous wrong have existed after
the middle of the nineteenth century? Why should
it continue to exist at the dawn of the twentieth? Are
we, after all, only savages under a thin veneer of pretended
civilization?</p>
<p>On the thirtieth of June the Confederates again
assailed McClellan's retreating columns at Frazier's
farm. A fearful contest ensued, for so superbly had
McClellan organized and disciplined his army that
even after days of disaster and depressing retreat it
stood ready still to resist and to fight for every inch
of ground.</p>
<p>Here the Confederates confidently expected to
overwhelm and capture McClellan's army, compelling
its surrender. And there is small doubt that such
must have been the outcome of the action had Lee's
lieutenants accomplished that which he had set them
to do. But Magruder and Huger failed Lee at the
crisis. It was his plan that they should assail the
Federals in flank with all possible vigor, while Jackson,
Longstreet and A. P. Hill should press them

<pb id="VAC0885-414" n="408"/>

upon the rear of their retreat which now became their
front for purposes of battle. The destruction of
McClellan's army seemed a certainty. But neither
Magruder nor Huger arrived in time to make Lee's
plan of assault successful. There was a bloody battle,
but by reason of the delay of these two lieutenants it
was an abortive one, failing utterly to accomplish that
final and decisive overthrow and capture of McClellan's
army upon which Lee had reckoned as the
crowning achievement of this Seven Days' campaign.</p>
<p>The failure of these two generals to fulfil their
obligations--a failure which resulted in the baffling
of Lee's supreme purpose at the very moment when
their presence must have given him quite all that he
desired of victory--might well have been made the
subject of an inquest by court martial or by a court of
inquiry. But as Lee in the exceeding gentleness of
his nature omitted to order any such inquest, the matter
presents no authoritative basis of fact on which the
historian may rest an award of blame. This much,
however, seems to be certain--that if Huger and
Magruder had done what Lee had ordered them to
do, and what they might easily have done, McClellan's
army must have been destroyed or captured on that
thirtieth day of June, 1862.</p>
<p>As it was, McClellan fought all day and at night
resumed his retreat, still doggedly intent upon that
one difficult problem of "saving this army," concerning
which he had written so doubtfully and so despairingly
and so bitterly in his heart-wrung protest to
Secretary Stanton.</p>
<p>After a fearfully bloody struggle the Federal army

<pb id="VAC0885-415" n="409"/>

was able during the night to retire toward Malvern
Hill, a position which the Confederates could not
assail without exposing themselves to the destructive
cross fire of the Federal fleet in the James river.</p>
<p>McClellan had now been completely dislodged
from his position on the east and north of Richmond.
He had been defeated in battle day after day, and
driven out of his fortifications into a helpless retreat
to the cover of his gunboats in the James river. His
base of supplies at White House had been utterly
broken up. He had lost in this series of battles no
less than 15,249 men. The Confederates, being the
assailants, had suffered even greater losses.</p>
<p>The Confederates at this point made one disastrous
mistake. They had believed that McClellan would retreat
by the route by which he had come, and in that
belief they had remained where they were for twenty-
four hours. During that precious time McClellan
had moved his enormous wagon train and his great
herd of 2,500 cattle towards his new base.</p>
<p>At White House General Casey loaded all the supplies
he could upon transports and sent them to the
new base. But he was obliged to burn millions of
pounds of food and destroy hundreds of tons of ammunition
which he could not remove. Trains of
freight cars were loaded with food and ammunition
and deliberately switched off the railroad tracks and
into the river to prevent them from falling into the
possession of the Confederates.</p>
<p>In brief McClellan's defeat was disastrous in the
extreme; but by reason of the failure of Lee's lieutenants
to do their proper part at the critical time

<pb id="VAC0885-416" n="410"/>
                    
the Federal commander was spared the humiliation of
a surrender. He escaped instead to Malvern Hill
after a succession of bloody defeats and after sacrificing
the greater part of his reserve stores of food
and ammunition at what he had established as a secure
base of supplies.</p>
<p>It is not easy to imagine a completer or more disastrous
defeat than this of the Seven Days, or an enforced
retreat more humiliating. Yet at the last
moment McClellan was enabled, by the mistake or
the misconduct of Lee's lieutenants, to escape to
Malvern Hill, under cover of his gunboats, and there
Lee mistakenly assailed him, thus giving him, at the
end of a series of conspicuous defeats, the appearance
at least of a compensating victory.</p>
<p>Malvern Hill is rather a high plateau than a hill in
the proper sense of the term. It lies about sixty feet
above the surrounding country. It is a mile wide and
a mile and a half long. At its base is a network of
streams and impassable swamp lands, constituting a
natural fortification practically impassable to any
army in the field except at one point where a narrow
road leads up the hill. The plateau lies so close
to the James river that gunboats anchored in that
stream can command its one approach with deadly
certainty.</p>
<p>Here McClellan stood at bay. Here a wise direction
should have made an end of the Confederate pursuit
of him. To assail him there was to invite needless
slaughter with no hope of any result commensurate
with the inevitable sacrifice of human life.</p>
<p>But the Confederates were flushed with a week of

<pb id="VAC0885-417" n="411"/>
                    
continuous victories, and they hurled themselves recklessly
upon Malvern Hill, hoping there to retrieve
their lost opportunity of destroying or capturing the
army that a week earlier had besieged and threatened
Richmond.</p>
<p>The assault upon such a position ought not to have
been made at all. Still worse, it was blunderingly
made. The Confederates were not ready to bring
their whole force into action when the first advance
occurred, or in any wise to support the assailing force.
Seven thousand men, with six guns, charged up the
slope. There were thirty guns in position to sweep
them away as with a broom, and many times seven
thousand men to resist their advance. There was also
the terrific fire of the gunboats to tear their columns
into shreds and to throw their men into confusion.
Still more important perhaps was the fact that the
Confederate artillery had not yet been organized as
a separate arm of the service. Each brigade had its
battery, but there was nowhere any authority to bring
these scattered batteries together and make them effective
by massing them. Six guns in the presence
of thirty were quickly put out of action, and throughout
the day there was a like disproportion, due to the
mistaken system which assigned batteries to brigades
instead of organizing the whole artillery force into a
single arm of the service and placing each corps of it
under a commander of its own who could mass it at
will and make it effective by concentration.</p>
<p>McClellan had massed his artillery; Lee had not
massed his. The result was that McClellan's artillery
fire quickly dismounted Lee's guns and rendered them
useless.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-418" n="412"/>
                    
<p>After this first fruitless assault was repelled, there
was nothing but artillery dueling for some hours.
It was not until late in the afternoon of July 1 that
Lee was ready to assail his enemy with his entire force.
Then there was a strange lack of concert. One division
after another attacked without support and was
beaten back for want of it. At no time did the Confederates
hurl their whole force upon their enemies.
They fought gallantly, but in detail, and therefore
without effect.</p>
<p>The fighting was continued till nine o'clock in the
evening. Its net result was that the Confederates had
failed to dislodge McClellan from his strong position.
But they had so nearly accomplished that object that
McClellan dared not risk another day's trial of the
issue, even in his supremely advantageous position.
He withdrew during the night to Harrison's Landing
under cover of his gunboats, and the Seven Days' battles
were done.</p>
<p>No military operation was ever more dramatic than
this. At the beginning of that fateful week McClellan,
with about 120,000 men, was closely besieging
the Confederate capital. His heavy guns were almost
within shelling distance of the city, and an army
of 40,000 men or more, was marching to his reinforcement.
At the end of that week's fighting the broken
remnant of his army was thankfully cowering under
cover of a resistless gunboat fire, with siege abandoned,
works deserted, millions of dollars worth of
stores destroyed, and such a record of daily defeats
as falls to the lot of few armies in the field.</p>
<p>But one thing had been demonstrated, McClellan

<pb id="VAC0885-419" n="413"/>

had made an army out of the exceedingly raw material
furnished to his hand. He had converted "a
mere collection of regiments cowering on the banks
of the Potomac, some perfectly raw, others dispirited
by recent defeat, some going home," into an army
capable of meeting and fighting Lee at Mechanicsville,
Frazier's Farm, Gaines's Mills, Savage's Station
and Malvern Hill.</p>
<p>Henceforth the war was to be fought out by
armies of seasoned soldiers and not by raw recruits
and panic-stricken volunteers.</p>
<p>This great series of battles had cost the Confederates
about 19,000 men and the Federals 15,249. It
had made an end of the second attempt to conquer
Richmond and in that way to finish the war. It
had left the Confederates as conspicuously victorious
in the east as they were conspicuously defeated in the
west.</p>

<p>Lee had now accomplished the first of his two purposes.
He had raised McClellan's siege of Richmond.
He had not succeeded in capturing or destroying
McClellan's army as he had hoped to do, but he
had completely baffled its endeavor. He had driven
it out of its strongly fortified positions. He had kept
it in an enforced and continuous retreat for a whole
week. He had compelled it to fight losing battles by
day, and to spend the nights in painful and exhausting
efforts to escape, which McClellan himself, as his
grieved and angry official reports clearly showed, regarded
as efforts of extremely doubtful outcome.</p>
<p>McClellan's campaign against Richmond had disastrously
failed. He had saved his army indeed without
a repetition of the Manassas panic, but he had
been baffled in all his purposes and driven for seven
days and nights like a hunted stag seeking safety in
flight. All his combinations had come to naught, all
his elaborately constructed earthworks had failed him
even as means of holding his position as an assailant.
All his siege guns had proved of no avail.</p>
<p>But he had organized a great army so well disciplined
that it could fight with determination, lose with
a calm mind, and retreat before a pursuing enemy
without losing cohesion or falling into panic. That

<pb id="VAC0885-421" n="415"/>
    
service of his was emphasized during all the brilliant
future history of the Army of the Potomac. It made
itself manifest at Antietam, at Fredericksburg, at
Chancellorsville, at Gettysburg, and later at the Wilderness,
Spottsylvania, Cold Harbor and Petersburg.
But with all his splendid ability as an engineer, and
his still more conspicuous gifts as an organizer of raw
material into an effective force, McClellan was manifestly
unfit to command an expedition in which he
must try his wits against the genius of Robert E. Lee
and Stonewall Jackson. A historian most friendly to
him, Dr. Rossiter Johnson, has written: "He was an
accomplished engineer and a gigantic adjutant, but
hardly the general to be sent against an army that
could move and a commander that could think."</p>
<p>Lee had driven a splendid army, nearly double his
own in numbers, to a position where it lay cowering
on the river-bank, under protection of the gunboats
and no longer depending upon its own prowess even
for self-defense.</p>
<p>But Lee had not destroyed McClellan's army, or
captured it, or even weakened it in any conspicuous
degree. That army, splendidly organized, superbly
equipped, and strengthened rather than weakened in
morale, lay securely at rest on the James river, within
easy striking distance of Richmond. There was no
knowing at what moment McClellan might hurl it
again upon Richmond or upon that commanding key
to Richmond--the Petersburg position. In the hands
of a capable commander McClellan's army would at
this time have been a more serious menace than ever
to the Confederate capital, for it now had an absolutely

<pb id="VAC0885-422" n="416"/>
                    
secure and unassailable base of operations, while
its fighting quality had been improved rather than
impaired by its seven days of battling.</p>
<p>Thus the second part of Lee's military problem remained
still to be solved, and it was very greatly the
more difficult part--the part that most imperatively
called for the exercise of strategic genius of a high
order. He must prevent a junction between Pope's
army, which was now advancing by way of Manassas
Junction, and McClellan's force on the James river.
He must overthrow Pope on the one hand and compel
McClellan to retire on the other.</p>
<p>For the accomplishment of this Lee relied confidently
upon the positively morbid dread of the loss
of Washington which at that time filled the Northern
mind and inspired every order given at the Federal
capital. His problem was to put Washington in peril
without losing Richmond, and thus to compel the
withdrawal of McClellan's army for the defense of
the Federal capital and to meet a threatened invasion
of the North.</p>
<p>To that end Lee boldly risked a division of his force
as he afterwards did on several occasions in presence
of an enemy who already outnumbered him.</p>
<p>On the thirteenth of July he detached Jackson, with
his own and Ewell's commands, to operate against
Pope in northern Virginia, himself holding Richmond
with the rather scant remainder of his army.</p>
<p>Jackson moved at once to Orange Court House,
confronting Pope. This movement threatened Washington
only in a rather remote way and not very
seriously, but it had the desired effect. A part of


<pb id="VAC0885-423" n="417"/>
                    
McClellan's force was at once withdrawn from the
position at Harrison's Landing and sent by water to
the national capital as a reserve and reinforcement for
Pope in case that general should be beaten in the field.</p>
<p>Promptly--near the end of July--Lee sent A. P.
Hill's corps to Jackson, and, thus strengthened, Jackson
pushed his column across the Rapidan river and
encountered a part of Pope's forces at Cedar Mountain
on the ninth of August. The action was not a
decisive one, but it served Lee's purpose of compelling
the early and complete withdrawal of McClellan
from his threatening position below Richmond.</p>
<p>Two days after the battle at Cedar Mountain Jackson
retired to the south bank of the river to await the
reinforcements which Lee was sending to him as rapidly
as McClellan's withdrawal rendered it measurably
prudent for him to deplete the army defending Richmond.</p>
<p>By August 14, Lee had transferred practically
all of his army from Richmond to the line of the
Rapidan, leaving only a meager garrison at the Confederate
capital. On that day he joined the army
and assumed direct personal command.</p>
<p>Pope was a good and active officer, unfortunately
given to vainglorious boasting. He dated his orders
"Headquarters in the saddle, Army in the field," and
set forth in them the assertion that he had so far seen
only the backs of the rebels. He announced his policy
in the phrase, "bayonets to the front, spades to the
rear." In brief, he jauntily and with ridiculous boastings,
undertook to meet one of the finest fighting
forces that had ever been organized in the world,

<pb id="VAC0885-424" n="418"/>
                    
commanded by the most brilliant and the ablest general
of the South. He thus prepared for himself a
peculiar humiliation in the event of defeat, stripping
himself in advance of all excuses and all pleas in
abatement of failure, and in advance minimizing the
glory of victory should he succeed in overcoming Lee.</p>
<p>There was no more ridiculous spectacle seen from
beginning to end of the war than this. It invited all
the wits of the newspapers to facile jestings, and
when Pope's failure was complete, one of them said, in
reference to his "headquarters in the saddle" phrase,
that he had "placed his headquarters where his hindquarters
ought to have been."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, General John Pope was a very able
and a very enterprising officer, as he had demonstrated
at the West. He knew how to handle an army
effectively, and he had an army of great effectiveness
under his command, with seasoned and battle-trained
reinforcements coming to him every hour from McClellan's
splendidly behaving force. He boldly challenged
Lee's advance and baffled it for a time. He
had all that could be imagined of equipment and of
limitless supplies. Had he been even in a measurable
degree the commanding military genius that he confidently
believed himself to be, he must have hammered
Lee's forces into confusion at the first encounter
and driven the great Confederate back to his
half-hopeless task of defending Richmond behind a
barrier of earthworks. The result of the encounter
was quite other than this, as we shall see.</p>
<p>Having at last brought up a force slightly superior
to Pope's, Lee's plan was to attack as quickly as possible


<pb id="VAC0885-425" n="419"/>

and before Pope should be strengthened by the
heavy columns of reinforcements that were hurrying
to his support from McClellan's army and from every
other quarter whence reinforcements could be drawn.
But before Lee's dispositions for attack could be completed,
Pope penetrated his design and fell back to
the stronger line of the Rappahannock.</p>
<p>The two armies confronted each other with that
river between. Lee moved by his left flank up the
river while Pope kept pace with him, alertly meeting
him at every available point of crossing, with his
army in discouragingly strong positions, and prepared
to resist to the utmost any attempt the Confederate
general might make to force a crossing.</p>
<p>To Lee this was a lamentable waste of time, while
to Pope it was a matter of hourly gain in strength.
For while Lee already had with him all the forces
that he could hope to concentrate in that quarter, regiments
and brigades and divisions were constantly
pouring forward from Washington to strengthen
Pope's command.</p>
<p>Finally Lee succeeded in outwitting his adversary.
At a place near Warrenton Springs he came to a
halt and made ostentatious demonstrations of an intention
to force a crossing of the river at that point.
Pope stood ready to meet him, with all his army
strongly posted, and with hourly strengthening field
works to make the assault of the Confederates the
more difficult and the more perilous.</p>
<p>But Lee in fact had no intention of joining battle
on such unequal conditions and risking the fate of his
campaign upon his ability to carry such a position, so

<pb id="VAC0885-426" n="420"/>
                    
strongly defended. While occupying Pope's attention
there with a simulated purpose of forcing the
fords he resorted to that tactical device which served
him so often and so well later in the war. He detached
Jackson, sending him with a strong force to
march around Bull Run Mountain, cross through
Thoroughfare Gap, and threaten Pope's depots at
Manassas and his lines of communication north and
south of that now historic point.</p>
<p>Jackson's movement was completely concealed and
altogether successful. On the twenty-sixth of August
he fell like a thunderbolt upon Pope's depots at
Manassas and captured them. Meanwhile, under
Lee's orders, Longstreet was following Jackson, and
on the twenty-ninth he formed a junction with him at
or near the point where the first important battle of
the war had been fought.</p>
<p>But Pope had not been idle or inattentive during
these pregnant days. As soon as Jackson's descent
upon his supply depots was made known to him, he
abandoned his position on the Rappahannock and fell
back to try conclusions on the historic field of Manassas.
Having received still further reinforcement
from McClellan, his army now slightly exceeded
Lee's in numbers and considerably exceeded it in
other elements of strength. Accordingly, being a
commander of great enterprise and vigor, he at once
assailed Lee at Manassas in full force. For two days
he hurled his heavy battalions upon the Confederates,
severely taxing and testing their resisting power.
For these were armies of veteran, battle-seasoned soldiers
that were fighting each other now, and not the

<pb id="VAC0885-427" n="421"/>

raw levies of a year before. They fought with order
and system and their minds were open to no such
panic impulses as those that had put McDowell to
rout and reduced what had been placed under his command
as an army to the condition of an insanely
frightened mob.</p>
<p>But on the other hand the Southerners were commanded
now not by a pair of inexperienced ex-captains
of the Engineer Corps, but by Robert E. Lee
himself, with Stonewall Jackson and James Longstreet
and R. S. Ewell and the two Hills for his lieutenants.</p>
<p>The attack was determined; the defense obstinate;
the fighting heroic; the result bloody in an extreme
degree.</p>
<p>The field was contested for two days with a heroic
stubbornness on either side which showed clearly how
great a change had been wrought in the conditions of
the war by the disciplining of the troops, by their experience
in the brutally bloody work of war, and by
the training such experience had given to their officers.</p>
<p>The end of it was that Lee drove Pope across Bull
Run and back to Centreville. Immediately he followed
up his victory as Johnston and Beauregard had
not done a year before on the same field. He turned
the position at Centreville and compelled Pope to
retreat hurriedly, but in tolerably good order, upon
Washington.</p>
<p>It was in this conflict that a gallant and hard-fighting
Federal general, Fitz-John Porter, had the ill
luck to encounter criticism which resulted in his trial
by court martial and his dismissal from the army in

<pb  id="VAC0885-428" n="422"/>
                    
disgrace. It was not until many years afterwards
that the actual facts of the fighting were clearly and
convincingly made known with the result of relieving
General Porter of the stigma he had so long unjustly
borne, and rehabilitating his high reputation in the
minds of his countrymen.</p>
<p>The story of it all is one of pitiable and long-continued
suffering under misapprehension and falsehood.
It is fully told in other publications than this,
and it has no proper place except that of casual mention,
in a simple chronicle of events such as the present
work is.</p>

<p>Lee seemed now to be master of the situation so
far at least as determining when and where the fighting
should be done. Within the brief space of two
months he had raised the siege of Richmond, maneuvered
McClellan completely out of Virginia, and
overthrown Pope in a two-days' battle compelling
that commander to retire behind the defenses of
Washington.</p>
<p>There remained no Federal army in Virginia.
There was no further defensive campaigning to be
done there. Lee decided at once upon an aggressive
operation of the utmost boldness. He determined to
transfer the seat of war to the regions north of the
Potomac, to threaten and if possible to capture the
Federal capital, either by direct approach or by the
conquest of Baltimore, which would isolate Washington
and compel its abandonment.</p>
<p>In order to understand the importance of the issues
of such a campaign as Lee now planned, the reader
must bear in mind that Mr. Lincoln's government
was at that time subject to a "fire from the rear;" that
a very large part of the Northern people sympathized
with the South; that a still larger part disapproved of
the war on other grounds than sympathy--grounds of
commercial interest, political prejudice and the like.

<pb id="VAC0885-430" n="424"/>
                    
The cost of carrying on the struggle had already become
appalling to those who must meet it by the payment
of taxes. The desire to end it, and the conviction
that it was hopeless of the results proposed, were
widespread.</p>
<p>Under such conditions it is easily obvious that if
Lee could at that time have made himself master of
Washington or Baltimore or both, all that had gone
before either of victory or of defeat would have been
as dust in the balance. It would have been next to
impossible, under such circumstances for Mr. Lincoln's
administration to prosecute the struggle further.
The national credit, already seriously impaired,
would have been destroyed. Neither men nor the material
necessaries of war would have been at all
adequately forthcoming. A great cry must in that
case have arisen for the ending of the struggle by the
recognition of Southern independence. With the Confederates
in possession of Washington and Baltimore
every foreign power would have joined its voice to
that of the doubters and malcontents at home in a
clamorous demand for an immediate "peace at any
price" with a triumphant foe.</p>
<p>To make an end of the war in this way was the stupendous
task that Lee set himself to accomplish.
His means were scanty and his grounds of hope for
success were small. But "war is a hazard of possibilities,
probabilities, luck and ill luck," and Lee was
a commander given to the taking of stupendous risks.</p>
<p>He had but 45,000 men with whom to undertake
a task for which a quarter of a million would not have
been an excessive or even a certainly sufficient force.

<pb id="VAC0885-431" n="425"/>

But those 45,000 men were soldiers of the very best
quality imaginable. They had been seasoned by severe
campaigning. They had accustomed themselves
to win in battle against heavy odds. They
believed in their leader and in themselves and were
ready to undertake any task that Lee might assign
them. They were stubborn men and stalwart, and
experience on march and in battle had made them as
nearly perfect soldiers as the world has anywhere or
at any time known.</p>
<p>On such an expedition as that which Lee planned,
they were certain to be opposed by armies greatly
exceeding themselves in numbers and immeasurably
superior in equipment and supplies. But they were
soldiers of that sort that can march on a diet of hard
tack and fight on no diet at all.</p>
<p>So with this slender force Lee crossed the Potomac,
on the fifth of September, abandoning his base of
supplies and his communications and depending for
the support of his army upon such foodstuffs as he
could secure in his enemy's country. As for reinforcements,
he perfectly knew that there were none
who could come to him.</p>
<p>It was a desperate hazard, conspicuously Napoleonic
in its daring.</p>
<p>Crossing the Potomac on the fifth of September,
Lee established himself on the eighth near Frederick,
Maryland, a point at which his presence threatened
Washington and Baltimore about equally. And both
those cities must be guarded against his advance, the
direction of which was of course uncertain. The capture
of either city would mean the speedy surrender
of the other.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-432" n="426"/>
<p>                    
To meet this danger the Federal Administration
hurriedly called to Washington every regiment and
brigade it could in any wise command. It united the
armies of McClellan and Pope and reinforced them
with every regiment that could be drawn from other
quarters. It restored McClellan to command--for
he had been temporarily removed in consequence of
his disastrous defeat at Richmond--and set him the
task of defending the National capital by meeting
and crushing Lee in the field. If Lee had commanded
an army of half a million men instead of the
meager 45,000 actually under his orders, the alarm
could scarcely have been greater or the preparations
to 'meet him more elaborate.</p>
<p>President Lincoln visited McClellan in person and
asked him to resume command of the combined
armies. McClellan accepted the commission.</p>
<p>Accomplished soldier that he was, he saw clearly
that the "objective" of his campaign must be the
crushing of Lee and the enforced retreat of the Confederates
to the southern side of the Potomac. To
that end McClellan desired to employ the utmost
force within call. He had about 70,000 men against
Lee's 45,000, but he urgently asked for the 11,000 additional
men who were guarding Harper's Ferry and
Martinsburg. He asked that those untenable positions
should be abandoned and their defenders added
to the already superior force with which he was to try
conclusions again with the masterful adversary who
had so conspicuously defeated him before Richmond.</p>
<p>But General Halleck was now in chief command
and he refused this request.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-433" n="427"/>

<p>His refusal to order the evacuation of the two untenable
positions and to add their important garrisons
to McClellan's force, seriously embarrassed Lee
and contributed, in an indirect but effective way, to
the defeat of those purposes with which the Confederate
chieftain had undertaken his hazardous campaign.</p>
<p>Lee had assumed, quite as a matter of course, that
upon his passage of the Potomac, Martinsburg and
Harper's Ferry would be evacuated, being obviously
untenable. But in fact they were not abandoned.
So Lee was compelled to pause and to send Jackson
back to the south side of the river to secure control of
positions that commanded his own only secure line of
retreat in case of disaster.</p>
<p>This caused a very serious delay in Lee's operations,
and in such a campaign of aggression, promptitude
and swiftness are all important to the accomplishment
of desired results.</p>
<p>Jackson went back across the river to assail Harper's
Ferry from the South. In the meanwhile McLaws,
Walker and D. H. Hill seized and held respectively
Maryland Heights, Loudon Heights and
Boonesboro Pass, while Lee with the remainder of
his now dangerously divided army advanced to
Hagerstown in search of food supplies.</p>
<p>Jackson did his part of the work perfectly, as it
was his custom to do. He drove his enemy out of
Martinsburg and captured Harper's Ferry with
11,500 prisoners, seventy-three serviceable guns and
important stores.</p>
<p>But in the meanwhile Lee's army had been scattered

<pb id="VAC0885-434" n="428"/>

in a very perilous way, and in his anxiety for
its reconcentration, he wrote out an order, giving in
detail his instructions to his several subordinates.</p>
<p>A copy of this order somehow fell into McClellan's
hands. It clearly revealed to him Lee's divided and
scattered condition, and for once in his life McClellan
hurried. If he, with 70,000 men, could manage to
attack in detail the several widely separated fragments
of Lee's army which had now been reduced by
casualties to less than a total of 40,000, surely he must
win.</p>
<p>Accordingly he hurriedly pushed forward, hoping
to carry Turner's and Crampton's Gaps in the South
Mountain before Lee could concentrate for their
defense.</p>
<p>He was a trifle too late, however, and a stubborn
defense was made there on the fourteenth, giving Lee
time to bring up the remainder of his forces for
the decisive battle at Sharpsburg or Antietam, as the
action is variously called at the South and at the
North. McClellan finally carried the gaps at cost of
a loss of 2,000 men--the Confederates losing a like
number.</p>
<p>But in the meanwhile McClellan had lost all the
strategic advantage that he was striving for. It had
been his hope to push his columns through the gaps--
as he might have done twenty-four hours earlier without
serious resistance--and to occupy commanding
positions between Lee's widely scattered forces, from
which, with his vastly superior numbers he might conquer
them in detail, probably compelling Lee's surrender
as a part of the price exacted.</p>

<pb id="VAC0885-435" n="429"/>
                    
<p>But McClellan was twenty-four hours late. He
therefore had to fight all day in order to force his
way through passes that a day earlier had been practically
open to him.</p>
<p>These actions were fought on the fourteenth of
September, 1862. They were quite separate in their
strategy and action, but they are classed together in
history as the Battle of South Mountain. The
struggle at both points was a fierce one and the casualties
were heavy on either side. At the end of it all
McClellan held the passes and was free to push his
army through them. To that extent he had won a
victory. But by his stout defense Lee had gained the
time he so badly needed in which to bring his scattered
forces together for the decisive struggle, and as that
was his sole object at the time, he justly felt that he
had accomplished the purpose with which he had undertaken
the battle.</p>
<p>Lee promptly prepared himself for the decisive
struggle. Retiring behind Antietam Creek, he took
up a strong position and awaited McClellan's assault.
He had by this time an army of less than 38,000 men
with which to meet McClellan's 70,000 or 75,000--for
reinforcements were hourly coming to the Federal
commander, and none to the Confederate.</p>
<p>This defensive battle was not at all what the Confederate
general had hoped for or intended. He had
been baffled of his purposes by adverse circumstances.
Had his enemy promptly evacuated Harper's Ferry
as he had expected and as McClellan had urged, Lee
would have pushed on towards Washington or Baltimore,
giving battle as the assailant wherever his

<pb id="VAC0885-436" n="430"/>

march might have been opposed. The necessity of
pausing to reduce Harper's Ferry had delayed him
during precious days, during which McClellan's advance
had completely changed the aspect of the campaign.
Instead of advancing to conquer Washington
or Baltimore, Lee fell back into a defensive position,
there to meet an army nearly or quite twice as
large as his own. In the meanwhile the necessity of
living upon the country had completely demoralized
those "lewd fellows of the baser sort," who constitute
a pestilently important contingent in every fighting
force. Men were away raiding chicken coops when
they should have been in line with guns in their hands.
Straggling was general beyond precedent, so that
Lee declared that his army was "ruined" by it, while
D. H. Hill said in his report of operations that "Had
all our stragglers been up McClellan's army would
have been completely crushed or annihilated. Thousands
of thievish poltroons had kept away from sheer
cowardice."</p>
<p>But the fact stares us in the face that McClellan
had under his command quite all of 70,000 men and
probably more, while Lee had at most considerably
less than 40,000,--and as both armies were composed
of seasoned soldiers who had fought before,
it is by no means safe to say that if this or if that
had been changed the result would have been other
than it was. With an "if," it is easy to demonstrate
anything.</p>
<p>The simple facts are that on the seventeenth of
September, 1862, the two armies met on Antietam
Creek in front of Sharpsburg, that they fought all

<pb  id="VAC0885-437" n="431"/>

day with high courage and desperate determination
on both sides; that the Federals lost, by official report,
12,469 men, while the Confederate loss, never accurately
reported, was estimated at between 9,000 and
10,000 men; that at the end of the struggle each
army held the position it had occupied at the beginning,
neither having yielded position to the other.</p>
<p>So far were both reluctant to renew the struggle
that they lay still, facing each other during the whole
of the next day, neither side firing a gun, and neither
undertaking a maneuver of any kind.</p>
<p>That was what is technically called a drawn battle,
a battle in which neither army can claim advantage
over the other. And in fact that was the exact situation.
Lee's men prided themselves upon the fact
that they had held their own against nearly or quite
twice their numbers, McClellan's men were proud to
think that they had not been beaten as other armies
had been by this phenomenal fighting machine of
Robert E. Lee's; that they had not been flanked or
caught in the rear, or in any other way outmaneuvered
or outfought, but had been able to hold their own
throughout the day and to maintain their ground
when the day was done.</p>
<p>Considered by itself this was in fact a drawn battle.
But considered more broadly in its relation to the
general course of the war, it was very clearly a defeat
for Lee, and a victory for his adversary. It made a
final end of the Confederate general's scheme of invasion.
It baffled all of his cherished purposes. It
rendered utterly futile the plans in pursuit of which
he had crossed the Potomac. It ended his hope of

<pb id="VAC0885-438" n="432"/>
                    
winning the war by the conquest of Washington or
Baltimore, or both. It referred military operations
again to Virginia, relieving all states north of the
Potomac of their share in the sufferings incident to
battles and campaigning.</p>
<p>Lee, being too badly crippled to continue his campaign,
retired after a day's rest, to Virginia. McClellan,
being too badly hurt to risk another contest,
declined to follow him or in any way to interfere with
his purposes.</p>
<p>The net results of Lee's campaign were that he had
captured 11,500 prisoners at Harper's Ferry together
with seventy-three guns and a vast store of food
and munitions. He had inflicted upon his enemy in
battle a loss of 12,469 men. On the other hand he
had suffered a loss of 9,000 or 10,000 men; his army
was reduced to 30,000 or less, and the strategic purpose
of the campaign had utterly failed. He had encountered
no disaster, but the expedition undertaken
with high hopes and positively Napoleonic purposes
had come to naught.</p>
<p>Then occurred one of those prolonged and unexplainable
pauses in the war to which wondering reference
has been made in an earlier chapter of this work.
With all the superb autumn weather before them--
the very best campaigning weather known to Virginia
--neither side did anything or tried to do anything.
Lee remained in the neighborhood of Winchester for
a month, at once inactive and unmolested. Then he
slowly retired to Fredericksburg, where he fortified
himself to meet the advance which Burnside, who had
succeeded McClellan, seemed to threaten by taking


<pb id="VAC0885-439" n="433"/>
                    
up a position at Acquia Creek, seven miles or so in
Fredericksburg's front.</p>
<p>But the battle at Sharpsburg or Antietam, had occurred
on the seventeenth of September and it was not
until near the middle of December that either of these
two armies again challenged the other to a contest of
arms.</p>
