        <p>The author believes that Americanism implies an adequate understanding of the ideals and
          aspirations of American democracy, a profound conviction as to their fundamental worth,
          and, above all, a deep sense of personal accountability for their development and defense.
          The great war afforded a dramatic demonstration of the utility and power of organized
          patriotic sentiment. For it was under its driving impulse that the people of America
          gloriously accepted the burdens and sacrifice of war.</p>
        <p>It is significant, however, that we do not always find the same degree of chivalry,
          devotion and self-sacrifice evidenced in our domestic conflicts. The reason is that our
          patriotic education has been too much restricted to the exploits of the battle-field and
          the achievement of martial glory. But the creation of patriotic sentiment need not be so
          confined. The instinctive and emotional life of the nation can be just as effectively
          mobilized around the tragic problems of domestic controversy and translated into
          constructive acts of social and political achievement, if we only will. An analysis of the
          vital problems of domestic life, in terms of the dramatic human interests that are at
          stake, will create a profound emotional response, which can be molded into a patriotic
          sentiment as dynamic in peace as it has been powerful in war.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the present volume has been to suggest ways and means by which the study
          and observation of American government, life and politics, whether in the local <pb
            id="VAC1001-008" n="[]"/>community or the nation's capital, may be made the basis for
          the development of such a sentiment of dynamic Americanism. This involves less emphasis
          upon political forms and more attention to the needs and functions of government and the
          dynamic forces of human nature that function through it. If the legal skeleton of civics
          is thus clothed with the flesh and blood of human interest, it loses the monotonous drone
          of chronological detail and takes on the gripping interest of the drama.</p>
        <p>The critical reader may complain of the "damnable reiteration" and the use of superfluous
          illustrations. There is no justification for the former other than the author's zeal to
          carry conviction to the reader. In the abundant use of illustrative material, the writer
          has sought to practise what he preached, and to make his theories vivid by expressing them
          in terms of modern life. It is to be hoped that this material will be found of special
          value and significance to many readers.</p>
        <p>In the bibliography at the end of each chapter are found only those references which
          would seem to be most useful in connection with the topics therein treated. Throughout the
          preparation of the work and particularly in selecting the bibliography, the author has
          received the generous and valuable assistance of his wife.</p>

            <p><hi rend="b">A</hi>N ELECTION was pending in a city of the Middle West. Public
              interest was at fever heat. The lines of battle seemed sharply drawn. The issues were
              cleanly cut. It was a conflict between the forces of righteousness and iniquity. The
              candidates of the opposing ranks personified their respective forces, one appealing
              directly to the idealism and intelligence of the public, the other to its prejudice
              and cupidity. One promised the fearless and able enforcement of the law; the other
              pledged a lawless and wide-open town. The records of the candidates were such as to
              afford sufficient evidence of their good faith. On the one side were marshaled those
              citizens who were ready to fight in defense of public decency and civic honor; opposed
              to them were gathered the forces of evil and corruption. The white-slaver, the vice
              king, the gambler, the crook and the boodler, all seeking freedom from legal restraint
              in their pernicious callings, rallied their forces to the conflict, spent their money
              with prodigality and worked with unceasing toil.</p>
            <p>Election day found both parties prepared and confident. Every possible precaution had
              been taken to prevent corruption and fraud. Detectives had been employed in scores to
              safeguard the ballot. For the first time in years a campaign had been forced along
              lines that would divide the sheep from the goats. It was a fair fight between good and
                <pb id="VAC1001-014" n="2"/> evil. There was no confusion of issues. It was honesty
              pitted against dishonesty, the law against the white-slaver, the public conscience
              against commercialized vice, public health against public disease, public morality
              against public immorality, public welfare against the public enemy. Patriotic citizens
              were elated with the coming triumph. At last the day had come. The people were on
              trial. Democracy would be vindicated.</p>
            <p>A group of faithful citizens was gathered in a downtown room to hear the election
              news. The results never were in doubt from the first returns. Little by little the
              lead of their enemy increased until his victory was acknowledged by a comfortable
              majority. The little band broke up, disappointed, hopeless and dejected. The people
              had been tried and found wanting. Democracy had not been vindicated.</p>
            <p>Among this little group was a school-teacher who had fought hard in the campaign. He
              had entered the contest with enthusiasm, for he saw an opportunity to try out the
              reforms which he had so long taught as the hope of democracy. He had taught his
              students in high-school history and civics that efficient government would come only
              with the enthronement of the people's will. He had argued with conviction that this
              would be accomplished with the advent of the primary and the safeguarding of the
              ballot. He had depicted the rôle of the political boss in scathing terms. To him had
              been ascribed the tragic horrors of the crowded tenements with their filth and
              immorality. To him had been charged the epidemics of preventable disease, the virtual
              licensing of crime and vice, and the general inability of the government to serve the
              human interests of the community. But the primary had been used, the ballot
              safeguarded, and still the boss had won. What was wrong? Had he been misguiding his
              students all these years when he had sought to place upon the boss the sole
              responsibility <pb id="VAC1001-015" n="3"/> for governmental ills? Had his dogmatic
              support of the new reforms, which he had preached with a crusader's zeal, been without
              reason and in vain? Could it be that democracy, the hope of every true American, had
              actually been tried and found wanting?</p>
            <p>These and similar thoughts crowded upon him in quick succession in the days that
              followed. Thousands of his fellow citizens who had shared the same hopes and suffered
              the same disappointments mingled their wondering doubts with his.</p>
            <p>Then slowly there began to dawn a new understanding. As he talked with his friends
              and acquaintances he was continually astounded to find how citizens of intelligence
              and honesty had voted against reform. Some had voted for the winning side because they
              felt the importance of partisan victory. Others voted against common decency because
              they feared that if the evils of the city were brought to light it would hurt its
              reputation, unsettle business and impair its prosperity. Others feared the effect on
              public utility securities, which were widely held and in which were invested, no
              doubt, some of the savings of widows and orphans. A group from a better residence
              district feared that under the administration pledged to abolish the "red light"
              district, its denizens might seek the residence districts of the city for their
              nefarious callings, thereby threatening the children and homes of the "better
              classes," rather than the households of the poor. Still others had been so deeply
              absorbed in their personal affairs that they had neglected the opportunities afforded
              by the election, or failed to see how the whole contest was fraught with the gravest
              possibilities for good or evil to the civic and spiritual interests of the community.
              The teacher discovered that the second strongest organization of physicians in the
              city had refused to support reform unless its advocate would pledge <pb
                id="VAC1001-016" n="4"/>himself not to maintain free dispensaries nor inaugurate an
              effective campaign against disease. Such methods, he was told, would interfere with
              private business.</p>
            <p>Amazed and disillusioned he began to realize that the citizens of the city did not
              want reform, or were too indifferent to make themselves effective. He faced the fact
              that every reform that is effective must, temporarily at least, encroach upon some
              sphere of private interest. He found that one can not promise to regulate public
              utilities in the interest of the public, without impairing the value of securities
              held by many influential citizens, banks and trust companies, whose sympathy for the
              widow and orphan investors was, perchance, largely dependent upon their personal
              holdings. The city can not clean up the tenements without imposing additional burdens
              for the time being upon the landlord and property owner. Public health can not be
              safeguarded without injuring the practise of physicians. Vice and crime can not be
              blotted out without taking away the abnormal rents landlords receive from property
              used for immoral and illegal purposes, and without threatening the more prosperous
              citizens with a portion of the inconvenience and danger to which they deliberately
              condemn the poor, who live in the segregated districts.</p>
            <p>This teacher also found that a great many honest and respectable citizens, the kind
              we think of as the backbone of the republic, could only see those aspects of politics
              that affected them. Their vision was too limited and their sympathies too well
              controlled to allow them to view the issue in its broadest human aspects. They were
              indifferent because they had no direct personal interest at stake.</p>
            <p>If these were the facts of our political life, and if these were the influences that
              controlled our elections, then his easy-going philosophy that the "remedy for the
              evils of democracy is more democracy" was impotent. The <pb id="VAC1001-017" n="5"/>
              enthronement of the public will was not the only essential of social and civic reform.
              As far as he could look into the future, thoroughgoing reforms must always run
              counter, temporarily at least, to private interests. Opposition would always develop
              from those whose interests were threatened. The direct primary and the security of the
              ballot would not change these interests but only make their expression the more easy
              and effective.</p>
            <p>Then what should he teach his class in civics? He had sought sincerely to make this a
              class for the development of citizenship. He had sought to equip his pupils with the
              ideas inherent in social progress, but these ideas had proved unproductive of results.
              Should he revise his philosophy of politics? Was democracy impotent? Could he go
              before his pupils with sincerity and power, and continue to espouse a system and a
              theory that had proved futile, that had not saved the city in a contest between right
              and wrong, and that had frustrated its noblest and highest aspirations? Could he
              defend a system of government that protected commercialized vice and immorality, that
              refused to oppose the spread of disease, and that encouraged individual selfishness to
              exploit the unhappy victims of the slums?</p>
            <p>This experience of an unusually conscientious and able teacher ought to come as a
              challenge to the entire profession throughout the country. The conflict that awakened
              him, with its dramatic appeal, is being reproduced in lesser degrees in every portion
              of our land. There is scarcely a local community where needless deaths do not occur
              from preventable diseases, that would have been prevented by the same degree of
              efficiency in government that we demand in private enterprise. There is not a state
              that does not offer up its annual tribute of human life to industrial accidents and
              diseases that could be prevented. There is not a Congress that does not make wasteful
              appropriations <pb id="VAC1001-018" n="6"/> for river and harbor bills, when like sums
              invested in a nation-wide fight on tuberculosis would produce untold dividends in
              human life and human happiness. There are communities all over the land where public
              funds are wasted in extravagance, if not in graft, which might be devoted to providing
              ample playgrounds and civic centers that would produce better citizens and higher
              morals. These conditions lead one to question the vitality of our democracy and to
              challenge our citizenship.</p>
            <p>Occasionally the public, aroused to a consciousness of its neglect, organizes a
              movement of relief against one ill or another. Some are pressed with vigor and
              determination until success is won, but many are mere abortive efforts, spasmodic and
              short-lived. Through the few that do succeed progress is being made. Our political
              life is growing better but the progress is slow and the mistakes are many. The cost of
              these failures is appalling and must be borne by the helpless and the weak. If the
              milk supply is uninspected, it brings death only to the homes of those too poor and
              ignorant to buy privately inspected milk. If housing conditions are unregulated, it is
              the unprotected children of the slums whose blighted lives must pay for democracy's
              mistake.</p>
            <p>The teacher in the public schools to-day, whose mission is the training of boys and
              girls for participation in democracy, is facing greater difficulties than in any other
              period of our nation's history. The problems of to-day that challenge constructive
              democracy are vastly different from those of the early days of the New World. We are
              prone to worship the past as the great day for American democracy. We think of the New
              England town meeting as the ideal of democratic accomplishment. We sigh as we compare
              with it the inefficiency of the city government of to-day.</p>
            <p>But the comparison is unfair. It leaves out of account <pb id="VAC1001-019" n="7"/>
              the tremendous difference in the nature of the problems to be solved. The New England
              town meeting was confronted with such problems as the location of a town well, the
              building of a schoolhouse or its repair, the fixing of the salary of the
              school-teacher, or the maintenance of the highway. With the Industrial Revolution,
              however, came a new set of problems, gigantic in size and complicated in nature. The
              factory system with its dangerous machinery created tremendous cities out of rural
              communities. The public utilities, with their financial power and political intrigue,
              menaced any government that sought to control them. Great trusts and monopolies, whose
              financial and political control threatened to vest them with autocratic power, seemed
              to spring up overnight. The industrial city came, with its problems of morals,
              diseases, sanitation and engineering projects, and challenged the deepest learning and
              the most constructive statesmanship that the nation could produce. In these facts the
              careful observer will find little basis for the pessimistic worship of the past, and
              ample challenge to the dynamic Americanism of the future.</p>
            <p>The new problems of the day demand more than the casual study of the patriot; they
              demand technical research, infinite patience, and a capacity for sustained, patriotic
              interest. The problems of the New England town meeting were not different from the
              problems that the pioneers were meeting every day in their customary callings. They
              were problems calling for the exercise of common sense and honest judgment. Most of
              them were solved by a few hours' careful discussion and deliberation. Compare these
              problems with those of the present. The citizens of to-day are called upon to grapple
              with the vexing problems of water supply, involving tremendous engineering feats; they
              are to solve complex questions of sanitation and public hygiene based upon the
              learning of technical science; they <pb id="VAC1001-020" n="8"/>have to adjust
              innumerable conflicts between the interests of the public and private enterprise in
              public utilities and public service; they must protect the health and limb of the
              employees against all manner of disease and accident without unduly impeding the
              processes of production; they must attack the mighty struggle between labor and
              capital, protecting the interest of the public, with impartial justice to either
              side.</p>
            <p>These problems can not be solved by momentary appeals to patriotic fervor. They are
              not amenable to solution by the application of good judgment and common sense alone.
              They require the patient research of the scholar and the technical efficiency of the
              expert. Back of these there must lie the eternal vigilance of the public, whose
              sustained interest will stimulate the fidelity and efforts of its servants, and whose
              ultimate judgment upon the results achieved must afford a rational and enlightened
              system of rewards or punishments for official effort. The formulation of public
              opinion and its application to modern problems through the media of scientific
              experts, preserving the efficiency of the expert and the point of view of the public,
              presents one of the most difficult problems of constructive politics.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the developing in the body politic of a capacity of sustained
              civic interest, sufficient to follow with unbiased zeal and discriminating judgment
              the slowly moving methods of scientific effort, is indispensable to social and
              political reform. Experts alone will tend to become bureaucratic unless closely
              followed by a patient though aggressive public, while public opinion will be impotent
              in the face of modern problems without the service of scientific effort. To arouse the
              public to a righteous and emotional protest against specific ills, especially if they
              appear in a dramatic setting, is easily and quickly done. It is the <pb
                id="VAC1001-021" n="9"/>national pastime of the politician and demagogue. But the
              public interest is too easily pacified by the impossible promises of the skilful
              politician. The public interest does not continue until the evil has been permanently
              eliminated. It is one thing for an aroused public to retire a public servant from
              office, and another thing to keep public interest up to the point of watching to see
              that the newly elected officer does not make the same mistakes. It is one thing to
              protest against an unjust and inefficient system of taxation until it becomes a
              political issue upon which a party comes into power, but it is a vastly different
              thing to keep the public interest centered upon the new administration for a length of
              time sufficient to produce a constructive system of finance. Thus it becomes evident
              that modern problems require for their solution a more virile and sustained civic
              spirit than was required for the solution of the more primitive problems of a century
              ago.</p>
            <p>In spite of these obvious needs, popular and hysterical revolts still continue the
              order of the day. Cities will become outraged over the dramatic revelation of some
              evidence of graft or fraud, but will fall back into indifference again before the
              newly elected administration has entered into office. The periodic exposés afford
              accumulating evidence of this tragic fact. As a result progress is slow, scientific
              and progressive methods have but little chance, and pressing modern problems go
              unsolved.</p>
            <p>To meet this condition many plans and panaceas have been suggested. Most of the
              panaceas have been mere changes in the form of government. The history of the last
              eighty years has witnessed a series of blind attempts to solve the problems of
              municipal inefficiency, by changing from one type of government to another and finally
              culminating in the present movement for the adoption of the <pb id="VAC1001-022"
                n="10"/> business manager form. But it has only been in the last portion of this
              period that any real progress seems to have been achieved.</p>
            <p>The direct primary has been espoused by many as the final bulwark against the
              encroachments of special privilege and the domination of the political boss. This has
              been given a fair hearing but the millennium has not appeared, while the demagogue and
              boss continue to exercise tremendous power. The initiative and referendum has been
              defended by the exponents of direct democracy, as the instrument through which popular
              government would realize its higher self, corruption and inefficiency be banished from
              our legislative halls, and the complicated problems of modern politics be adequately
              solved. The recall of public officers, we are told, would afford the people an
              instrument by which the public servant would be compelled to give an administration
              that would be wise, beneficent and effective.</p>
            <p>Again another group of political students has staked its hope of redeeming democracy
              upon the system of preferential voting, confident in the belief that if the wants of
              the citizens may be but accurately expressed, the problems of government will be
              safely met. The short-ballot movement, with its attractive program for simplifying the
              ballot and concentrating official responsibility where the voter may more easily make
              his influence effective, is another remedy which has rallied many to its cause with
              its promises of relief from the intolerable conditions of the present. To-day millions
              of our citizens are seeking hopefully, but impotently, for relief through one or more
              of these chosen methods. Like the school-teacher in the Middle West, they have a blind
              unquestioning faith in the efficacy of structural reforms. There is one thing, one
              great outstanding, fundamental fact they overlook&mdash;the mere change of
              governmental forms does not change the intelligence or civic interest of <pb
                id="VAC1001-023" n="11"/>the people who function through these forms. Every one of
              these suggested panaceas and remedies may be embodied in our fundamental law without
              necessarily solving a single problem, without wiping out a single evil, without
              bringing work to a single member of the army of the unemployed. The same problems
              would remain, the same conflicts in interest would continue, the same powerful,
              ingenious and autocratic bosses would still seek to hold the reins of government. It
              is true that new instruments will be available, and in so far as they might be better
              adapted to the problems to be solved, they would be helpful; but they are only
              instruments, and back of these instruments will be found the same lack of civic pride,
              the same want of a constructive patriotism, the same selfish and sordid interests, the
              same criminal indifference to the public weal, that have combined to produce the
              conditions and problems against which we righteously protest.</p>
            <p>Does this, then, mean that there is no escape from the evils and failures of
              democracy? Must we continue to render tribute to the forces of indifference, ignorance
              and greed? Must we continue the annual sacrifice of life, limb and soul to the
              preventable horrors of our industrial life? Or does it not show the pathway along
              which permanent reform must lead? Does it not point with dramatic vividness to the
              social and moral education of our youth, as the means of democratic accomplishment?
              Does it not bring out in bold relief the fundamental fact, that in the youth of
              to-day, the citizenship of to-morrow, must be developed the new patriotism of civic
              achievement, that vital sustained interest in public problems, that unfailing fidelity
              to the public weal, which the gigantic, complicated and portentous problems of modern
              life so imperatively demand?</p>
            <p>This, then, is the challenge of modern democracy to the modern school. Its
              fundamental basis is the fact that the <pb id="VAC1001-024" n="12"/> solution of
              modern problems requires more than the passing thrill of patriotic fervor, or the
              spasmodic protest of an outraged public. It requires more than the mere structural
              changes that are necessary from time to time. It requires a regenerated citizenship.
              It requires a keen sense of individual responsibility and a capacity for a sustained
              interest in civic matters. It requires that our process of education must build into
              the consciousness and soul of the child a new philosophy of life, the philosophy of
              service. There must be new ideals and aspirations aroused, strengthened and defined,
              the ideals of civic obligation. There must be a new morality evolved, and a new
              patriotism nourished, one that is both social and constructive.</p>
            <p>The bane of the popular conception of democracy is that it is expressed in the terms
              of the rights of individuals. The patriotic oration, the flamboyant appeals of the
              demagogue, the "rule of thumb" conceptions of the reformer, are expressed in the term
              of rights. One of America's leading citizens has boldly declared that democracy had
              the right to make mistakes. It follows then that when democracy mistakenly allowed the
              institution of child labor to gain a foothold in our country, until hundreds of
              thousands of children had been sacrificed to human greed, that democracy had the right
              to exact the lives and souls of children as the price of its indifference and
              mistakes. The piteous appeals of suffering children have for years fallen upon the
              unhearing ears of American citizenship. Their shrieks have beat with tragic impotence
              against the bulwark of democratic rights. Whence came this inhuman conception of
              democracy's rights? Who gave into the hands of an indifferent people the despotic
              right to pay their obligations with the lives and suffering of others? Who released
              the citizens of a democracy from the obligation of being their brother's keeper? These
              are questions that <pb id="VAC1001-025" n="13"/>should be thundered from every
              housetop until America is awakened, and until the pernicious doctrine of democratic
              rights has been obliterated by the larger vision of democratic service, made possible
              through individual consecration to the sacred duties of democracy.</p>
            <p>The teaching of this conception of democracy is of paramount importance, and
              experience would seem to indicate that if it is not done in our schools it is likely
              to go undone. The young citizen who can view preventable suffering without a sense of
              personal shame, or who can see the failures of our government to produce the largest
              possible dividends of human happiness without a twinge of conscience, is not yet
              morally equipped to fight the battles of aggressive, triumphant democracy. He lacks
              the necessary moral and spiritual equipment. It must be the mission of the school to
              supply that equipment. It must provide a sense of personal accountability. It must
              build up a dynamic theory of morality. It must produce a patriotism that is virile and
              constructive. It must produce a dynamic Americanism that will be practical and
              effective.</p>
            <p>The influence of the schools in building moral standards and quickening moral
              perception in certain lines of thought and conduct, gives promise of tremendous good
              when directed to the positive morality required by the civic duty of to-day. But so
              far most moral teachings have been negative and personal, ignoring the positive and
              the social. Few graduates of our public school would not blush for shame if detected
              in an act of dishonesty or personal immorality, but these same people will idly boast
              of an ignorance regarding the current issues of the ballot box and the capacity of
              candidates for public office, for whom they are asked to vote. It is the exceptional
              citizen that follows the fate of political issues and administrative policy from its
              inception, through the necessary machinery of political parties, <pb id="VAC1001-026"
                n="14"/>to its concrete realization in accomplished fact. Thousands of citizens will
              deplore the inefficiency and waste of government, while only tens will study out the
              responsible parties and apply the doctrine of strict accountability. Thousands will
              rise in righteous indignation against the depredations and despotism of unscrupulous
              bosses, and yet very few will take the time and energy to organize effectively against
              their power. We cry out against government that is weak, corrupt, incompetent, and yet
              we are unwilling to pay the price of efficient government, or bear the burdens of
              efficient democracy.</p>
            <p>The cry for reform is always in the air, but when a concrete measure is suggested
              that casts a burden upon a group or class, they are too frequently unwilling to bear
              the burden. They prefer the injustice and weakness of the present system, whose
              burdens may be shifted to others. Thousands of these same persons would rally to the
              defense of their ideals of national honor, were it assailed by a foreign foe. They
              would sacrifice their lives if need be in its defense. Let a weak sister republic fail
              to protect the lives of American citizens, and thousands will be found willing to make
              any sacrifice or bear any burdens necessary to avenge the insult to American honor.
              But industry and disease may claim its daily toll of hundreds, through the
              inefficiency of democracy, and the public sits by in complacent idleness. They see no
              blot on American honor in this useless sacrifice. They feel no patriotic call to fight
              against the disease, poverty and misery that follow in the wake of inefficient
              government. They have no conception of a nation's honor that calls for patriotic
              service in the cause of justice, righteousness and decency at home.</p>
            <p>These are the conditions that confronted the school-teacher of the Middle West, as he
              tried to adjust himself to the new conditions and problems of democracy, as <pb
                id="VAC1001-027" n="15"/> evidenced to him by the results of the city election upon
              which he had staked so much. These are the facts, unpleasant though they be, that
              challenge the attention of America to-day. If it be said that too much is expected of
              the citizens of a democracy, that they can not be expected to fight for reforms that
              interfere incidentally with their personal pecuniary interest, that they can not be
              expected to give patient and careful study to public problems, the answer is, then,
              that such a people needs rulers, and not servants, to guide their destinies. If this
              be the answer, then it means that to America democracy is an idle shibboleth with
              which the boss and demagogue may play. It means that the ideals and aspirations of
              American heroes whose memories we revere, the ideals and aspirations that sustained
              Washington at Valley Forge, that steeled the nerve and provided courage for the
              pioneers in their conquest of the West, that gave to Lincoln that infinite harmony of
              tenderness and strength with which to guide the destinies of a troubled
              nation&mdash;these, the most cherished possessions of a great people, consecrated by
              the toil and sacrifice of millions, are prostituted to a selfish individualism that is
              both sordid and sterile.</p>
            <p>But the American people have not lost their ideals. They ave not lost their capacity
              to respond to the call of human need. The instincts of sympathy and the love of
              justice still smolder in every true American. Absorbed in the mighty task of
              developing a continent, blinded by the most prodigal prosperity any nation has
              enjoyed, the American people have been too busy to stop to count the cost. The
              individualistic philosophy that answered the needs of the pioneer, has been
              unconsciously outgrown. They have been so engrossed in the creation of their material
              wealth that they have failed to grasp the human problems that it presented. The appeal
              to individual ambition, as the mainspring of human action, <pb id="VAC1001-028" n="16"
              />had gone unquestioned. The need of a broader vision and a nobler ambition had not
              been brought home. The old individualistic virtues were deemed sufficient.</p>
            <p>The function of modern education is to show that with this change from a pioneer
              nation to an industrial state, there have come new problems and new demands upon the
              spiritual and moral forces of the nation. These problems are fraught with the gravest
              significance to human happiness. They touch human life at a myriad different points.
              They make every voter of the republic the joint guardian of helpless children against
              the evils of the slums, for the state must be the champion of the helpless and the
              oppressed. These problems can not be ignored. Our country's existence is at stake,
              for, in the last analysis, the strength of a nation depends upon its capacity to serve
              its citizens, and to advance the cause of righteousness and justice.</p>
            <p>When these needs are brought home to the American youth; when he is taught to read in
              the complex problems of the day a challenge to his manhood; when he is brought to
              realize the most treacherous foes that assail his nation are the forces of greed,
              injustice and selfish indifference; when he is taught that patriotism is a virtue of
              peace as well as of war; when he begins to feel the thrill of exaltation that comes
              with civic duty well performed; when he is brought face to face with the gigantic
              problems of modern life with their challenge to his courage, his scholarship and his
              patriotism, the American youth will not be found wanting. The boundless energy, the
              inventive genius and the single-minded devotion which have characterized him on the
              battle-fields of Europe, in industrial conflicts and in professional effort, will be
              consecrated to the task of translating into actual life, the ideals and aspirations of
              American democracy.</p>
            <p>This, then, is the task that awaits the teacher as he stands <pb id="VAC1001-029"
                n="17"/>before his group of young Americans. They must be brought face to face with
              the realities of life. They must be brought to a deep appreciation of the duties of
              democracy. They must learn that the price of liberty, and justice, and progress is
              eternal vigilance. They must learn that the comforts of modern life have brought with
              them corresponding problems that they must solve. They must learn in school what the
              school-teacher of the Middle West learned through sad experience,&mdash;that the
              instruments of democracy alone do not suffice. Back of these instruments and back of
              democratic government, there must be the moral vision, the spirit of sacrifice, the
              sustained interest of the crusader, the valor of the soldier and the constructive
              patriotism of the statesman. If the ideals of democracy are to withstand the stress
              and strain of modern life, they must be founded upon a citizenship inspired with such
              a vision and animated with such a spirit. The development of this vision and spirit of
              democracy is not the work of the moment to be done in time of pressing need. It is the
              slow and patient method of building into youthful thought the social view-point, and
              of guiding the dynamic instincts of the child into channels of socialized
              activity.</p>
            <p>A representative of the Catholic Church is reported to have said that if it could
              have charge of a child's training and education until seven years of age, it would
              have no fear of the child's wandering away from the ideals and teachings of the
              church. In a democracy should it not be the aim of the public school so to select its
              methods, its curriculum and its teachers, that the youth of the land may go from its
              portals without danger of being lost to the vision, the ideals and the aspirations of
              democracy?</p>

            <head rend="center sc">HOW MAY CONSTRUCTIVE PATRIOTISM BE DEVELOPED?</head>
            <p><hi rend="b">T</hi>HE tragic need of developing constructive patriotism, as a part of
              the educational process, was vividly brought home to me in the first year of my
              teaching experience. I was teaching a university class in American government. With a
              beginner's zeal I was trying to make of the subject something more than a description
              of statutes and constitutions. I was trying to clothe the legal skeleton with the
              flesh and blood of political and social realities. I described government as a great
              cooperative enterprise, intended to minister to human needs. I attempted to analyze
              the dynamic forces of sympathy and greed, of altruism and avarice, of patriotism and
              indifference that functioned behind the scenes. I tried to portray the ceaseless
              conflict in the interplay of these contending forces.</p>
            <p>I was rewarded by the sustained interest of my students and their enthusiastic
              response. But my self-complacency was of short duration. One of the student
              organizations was found short in its accounts. An investigation followed. Ingenious
              grafting by student officials was discovered, and the dishonest methods employed were
              those learned in my course in government. I had so presented the corrupt influences at
              work that the pupils were impressed with the cleverness of the methods, rather than
              with the tragedies that they invoked. Instead of training effective citizens I was
              making expert grafters.</p>
            <p>Nor could this conspicuous failure of the teacher be shifted to any moral delinquency
              of the students. They <pb id="VAC1001-033" n="21"/> were normal boys with normal
              instincts and emotions. I had depicted graft and cunning without the revolting and
              inhuman consequences that beset its path. I had given only part of the picture, the
              clever manipulations of the corruptionists, inadvertently omitting the shocking
              results that would have outraged the sensibilities of the class and visited upon the
              grafters, not an appreciation of their cleverness, but the opprobrium of righteous
              scorn. I had pointed out the ludicrous mistakes and inconsistencies into which the
              vagaries of an indifferent electorate had led the government, without following up
              with remorseless thoroughness the inhuman consequences that too frequently ensued. The
              students had smiled at the humor but missed the tragedy.</p>
            <p>Students may smile admiringly at obstructionist tactics of ingenious leaders, but
              when they learn that the result is the failure of a milk inspection ordinance, and
              that the failure means the death of helpless children through the use of uninspected
              milk, the smile gives way to righteous indignation. They may view with complacent
              humor the devious methods of the demagogue to mislead the indifferent and uninformed,
              but when they learn that the success, so cleverly achieved, is at the expense of civic
              decency and honor, such indifference and ignorance becomes a challenge to their
              manhood and self-respect. The normal man hates injustice, resents the oppression of
              the weak, and will fight a denial of the square deal to his fellow men. And yet
              corruption in government, inefficiency in public office, or indifference among the
              electorate, is always followed by these pernicious evils. Had this connection been
              made definite, graphic and real, my students would have learned to loathe rather than
              to tolerate these fundamental ills.</p>
            <p>And this does not mean that class-room instruction must degenerate into "uplift"
              moralizing. Nor does it mean in any sense a sacrifice of scientific accuracy or
              exacting <pb id="VAC1001-034" n="22"/>scholarship. On the contrary it means an
              accurate portrayal of our institutions, the forces that function through them, and the
              results that are achieved. To do less would be unscientific, because it would be but a
              partial truth. To do more is useless. The instinctive reaction of the normal boy and
              girl when confronted with the human results of the failures and achievements of
              government will be far more effective than moral preachments. Let the people of
              America see our government and our democracy in its naked reality and in its fullest
              human significance; let them see the dividends of happiness that it can yield and the
              tragic suffering that it can cause; let them visualize with the dramatic vividness
              that the truth alone can give, the infinite possibilities of government for human weal
              or human ills, and there will develop a social consciousness and a constructive
              patriotism, that will function as long as men are endowed with the nobler impulses of
              the race.</p>
            <p>Civic indifference has not been due to lack of social instincts. The capacity of our
              people to respond generously and heroically to the call of humanity has given the lie
              to those who declared that our prosperity and love of ease had destroyed our nobler
              instincts. Absorbed in individualistic enterprise, or lulled to a false security by a
              too credulous faith in the capacity of the government to run itself, we have been
              blind to its possibilities and neglectful of its failures. Our task is to awaken our
              people to the realities of our political life, in order that our instinctive love of
              justice and the American sense of chivalry may be stimulated into effective action.
              For it is from these instincts that we must draw the virile power of social
              consciousness and dynamic Americanism.</p>
            <p>The possibilities thus afforded are evidenced by the successful work of the public
              schools in developing the patriotism of war. There is scarcely one among us that can
              not <pb id="VAC1001-035" n="23"/>recall the thrill of patriotic fervor with which we
              learned of the heroic exploits of Concord and of Lexington. Who has not felt the
              generous ardor of patriotic impulse in the story of Paul Jones and his ringing words,
              "Don't give up the ship"? What boy has not been prompted to heart-searching inquiry of
              his own loyalty by the heroism of Gettysburg and Chickamauga and the brilliant
              victories of San Juan and Manila Bay? These memories stand out as emotional epochs in
              the drab background of our educational careers. They were the occasions when daily
              lessons escaped the confines of the unreal and the pedantic, and when we lived as well
              as learned in the educational process.</p>
            <p>Has this work been well done? Has the school imparted to the average boy the lessons
              of love of country? Has it developed from his instinctive life a dynamic power of
              patriotism upon which the country could rely in the hour of national peril? The answer
              is found in the prompt enactment and remarkable enforcement of the draft law, in the
              fidelity and enthusiasm with which the public voluntarily accepted restrictions upon
              their traditional liberties; in the marvelous generosity with which our people poured
              forth their gold in voluntary offerings to their country's cause; and in the
              crusader's zeal of our soldiery and the deathless valor of our arms. Never was a great
              peaceful democracy converted into a resistless military power in so short a time.
              Never was a great citizen army of like dimension raised, equipped and trained so
              speedily and effectively. Never was industry revolutionized to the stern purposes of
              war with such precision and despatch. When all the mistakes are counted and all the
              blunders tabulated, the fact will still remain that America's response to the call of
              humanity surpassed, in speed, efficiency and magnitude, all previous achievements.</p>
            <p>America may seem to have hesitated at the beginning of <pb id="VAC1001-036" n="24"/>
              the struggle. Her response may seem to many to have been too long delayed. But the
              cause is to be found in the traditional ignorance of our public in regard to world
              affairs, and the naive confidence of our people in the perfection and saving grace of
              our isolation. Our delay resulted from ignorance and not from ignoble desire. We were
              slow in realizing the sinister character of the struggle, but when the real issues
              became apparent, we did not hesitate. America's real spirit has been accurately
              portrayed by an English critic who declared that our neutrality was the only possible
              course "until the great majority of the American people shared in the president's
              knowledge and insight; and, deep as was the ignorance of European affairs among the
              mass of the British people in 1914, it was still more profound among the mass of
              Americans, thousands of miles away from Europe. The enlightenment of this vast body of
              opinions was slow, but it was sure. The truth would out. Prussianism at war inevitably
              unmasked itself; it boasted of its strength and its project of dominion; it displayed,
              on a wider scale and in a more terrible and indiscriminate fashion than the world had
              yet seen, the evils that flow from irresponsible power. And so the American people,
              like their British kinsmen, were awakened to the facts; more than that, they were
              forced, as we were, to forsake a tradition of isolation from Europe and an
              indifference to its destiny that was older and stronger than our own."</p>
            <p>America's magnificent response, when the issue became clear, is sufficient evidence
              of the patriotic education of our people. But how has it been accomplished? When we
              have been so successful in developing the patriotism of war, why have we so nearly
              failed in inculcating a patriotism of peace? The same men and women who will willingly
              give their all to defend their national honor, will frequently view domestic tragedies
              and disgrace with indifference and <pb id="VAC1001-037" n="25"/>unconcern. An insult
              to American citizens in foreign lands is met with unified hostility and resentment,
              but the useless loss of a million lives through the ravages of preventable disease is
              viewed in complacent ease.</p>
            <p>The answer is not hard to find. War is an intensely dramatic subject. Its appeal to
              the basic instincts is clear, vital and resistless. It takes no careful preparation by
              the teacher, no penetrating powers of analysis, no wealth of descriptive genius, to
              arouse an emotional response. Its heroism, its tragedy, its sacrifice are
              self-apparent. The appeal to the instinctive love of conflict, the instincts of
              chivalry, of sympathy and of the heroic are automatic. The barest study of our
              military history can not help but arouse the thrills of patriotic fervor. It can not
              help but inculcate into the consciousness of youth an admiration and a love for
              martial glory. Youth becomes enamored with the thrill of generous emotion. It is the
              only manly outlet for his nobler instincts that his contact with life has afforded
              him. He delights to give himself up to its exhilarating experiences on stated
              patriotic occasions. It is in this way that the patriotic education of our youth has
              been accomplished. It has followed the line of least resistance, and the more
              difficult and important problem of creating patriotic interests in the problems of
              peace has been neglected. In fact, it has sometimes seemed that we have been
              unconscious of the need of such an interest. We seem to have forgotten that for every
              year our nation has spent in war, we have lived fifteen years in peace. We have
              ignored the gigantic problems of domestic justice, of public health, and of social
              amelioration that daily cry out for settlement. We have forgotten that their
              successful solution requires the spirit of self-sacrifice and the resistless devotion
              to the public weal that only a deep sense of constructive patriotism or dynamic
              Americanism can provide.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-038" n="26"/>
            <p>We are directly confronted with the problem of whether such a spirit of constructive
              patriotism or dynamic Americanism can be developed. Is war the only cause around which
              we can rally the emotional powers of man? Is war the only business of society that
              carries its appeal to the instinctive forces of humanity? Is there nothing in the
              study of the community, in the history of our years of peace, in the social and
              industrial conflicts of our national life, in the battle between political ideals,
              that has its appeal to the dynamic forces of instinctive life? This is the crucial
              point.</p>
            <p>The superficial popular belief seems to be that problems of peace do not have their
              appeal to the instinctive forces of human nature. Certain it is that the appeal is not
              so self-evident or so automatic. Certain it is that if the appeal is there it will
              require careful preparation, the exercise of analytical powers and the use of accurate
              description to drive it home with telling force. But these difficulties can not hide
              the fact that in the problems of modern life, with all their tragic settings and
              implications, there are untold possibilities for effective appeals to the instincts
              that will produce great resources of emotional power. It is in the cultivation and
              direction of these instincts and their accompanying emotions that we may inculcate an
              effective spirit of constructive patriotism.</p>
            <p>We must, therefore, consider the nature and character of instincts to ascertain what
              ones are available for our purposes and how they are to be utilized. For our uses the
              discussion of the instincts as given by William McDougall in his <hi rend="i"
                >Introduction to Social Psychology</hi> is perhaps the most useful one. He defines
              an instinct "as an inherited or innate psycho-physical disposition which determines
              its possessor to perceive, and to pay attention to, objects of a certain class, to
              experience an emotional excitement of a particular quality upon perceiving such an
              object, and to <pb id="VAC1001-039" n="27"/>act in regard to it in a particular
              manner, or, at least, to experience an impulse to such action."</p>
            <p>For purposes of illustration, let us examine an example of parental instinct with its
              accompanying tender emotion. Normal human beings, especially women, upon seeing a
              little helpless baby, experience the tender emotion and are conscious of a desire to
              extend physical protection to the child by throwing the arms about it. Here is an
              innate, inherited quality which causes one to pay attention to an object of a
              particular class, to experience a definite emotion and to feel an impulse to definite
              action regarding it. This inherited, innate quality then is an instinct.</p>
            <p>Instincts are the sole springs of human action. They are the dynamic forces of life.
              They are the causes of all bodily and mental action. To control, train and cultivate
              the instincts is to control the thought and action of the individual. How far, then,
              may this be done is a vital question.</p>
            <p>In considering the possibility of modifying the instincts, McDougall makes an
              analysis of the instinctive process which seems helpful. The innate psycho-physical
              disposition which we call instinct he divides into three parts, the inlet or afferent,
              the central, and the motor or efferent part. The afferent or inlet is that part of the
              process by which the impulses initiated by the perception of the native object of the
              instinct are received and elaborated. The central part is that which determines the
              distribution of the nervous impulses which are the correlates of the emotional aspects
              of the process. The efferent determines the distribution of impulses to the muscles
              which are to carry out the felt impulse to action. Thus in the case of the parental
              instinct, the afferent is that part of the instinctive process by which the perception
              of a child stimulates the psycho-physical disposition. The central part is where the
              nervous impulses are aroused and the tender emotion created. The efferent <pb
                id="VAC1001-040" n="28"/>is that part of the process which creates the impulse to
              throw the arms around the child in a protecting embrace.</p>
            <p>The afferent or receptive part, and the efferent or motor part, are capable of great
              modification, independently of each other and of the central part, the latter
              persisting "throughout life as the essential unchanging nucleus of the disposition."
              This is of supreme importance, for in our complex civilization appeals to the basic
              social instincts, in their native forms, are rarely possible. They are apparently too
              remote, or so complicated and varied in their expression, as not to be recognized. And
              yet the hope of society must be based upon the virile effective action of citizens,
              motivated by their social instincts and directed by intelligent choice.</p>
            <p>No group of American citizens anywhere would tolerate the sight of babies being
              poisoned by improperly adulterated milk. Yet these same men would witness the defeat
              of a milk inspection ordinance with scarcely a second thought, although the defeat of
              the ordinance means the poisoning of babies. But to comprehend that requires thinking
              and imagination to follow out the causes to their natural results. The two have not
              yet been associated in their minds, and until they are, there will be no popular
              demand for milk inspection, no adequately effective motive to secure its passage and
              enforcement. The real problem, therefore, is to educate the voter to the point where
              he understands the real human significance of such an ordinance, and until, therefore,
              a new afferent inlet into his instinct of tender emotion has been established.</p>
            <p>Stated more broadly, the fundamental problem of civic training is to establish new
              afferent inlets to the basic social instincts of the voter, so that his response to
              the problems of peace will be as effective and virile as his response to the challenge
              of war. This is to be done by showing him that <pb id="VAC1001-041" n="29"/>the
              functions of government may be actually translated into terms of human happiness and
              human woe. Governmental inefficiency must be synonymous in his mind with the want,
              misery and immorality that flourish in the city slums; with the loss of life through
              preventable accidents, and with the poverty and desolation of the orphan children that
              frequently follow in its wake; and with the blighted opportunities of growing girls
              and boys whose school-days and idle hours have not been profitably employed. This
              conception of the human significance of government must be brought home time and time
              again, with countless incidents, until it has become a part of his daily thought and
              of his point of view.</p>
            <p>But this is not all. Not only must our citizens be so trained that civic problems
              will find an inlet to their instinctive life, but the efferent part of the process
              must be directed to function effectively. It is not enough that the defeat of the milk
              inspection ordinance should outrage the feelings of the voter by appealing to his
              parental and pugnacious instincts. Unless there follows an intelligent and effective
              effort to create a public opinion and to hold the proper officers to strict
              accountability, the voter will be impotent. Training for civic responsibility must
              include a training in the essential nature of our democracy, in the relations of the
              voter to his community, his political parties and his state, and in the proper methods
              of making his voice effective. Finally it must include the driving home of the
              conviction that the tragic results of the defeat of the milk inspection ordinance
              continue their daily toll of life until the action has been reversed. If this is done
              the impulse to action in behalf of the helpless babies continues until its possessor
              secures the thrill of joy that comes from its fulfillment, or the pain and anger that
              results from effective opposition. For in the latter case the instinct of pugnacity
                <pb id="VAC1001-042" n="30"/>and the emotion of anger are aroused and a new dynamic
              force is available on the side of justice and humanity.</p>
            <p>Any such effective program for the moral or social training of the youth invariably
              encounters many scoffers who will declare it can not be done. They take refuge in the
              old adage that one can't change human nature. The obvious answer is that no one is
              seeking to change human nature. Our whole program is based upon the elemental
              instincts which help to constitute human nature. All we argue for is to make human
              nature more articulate amid the bewildering complexities of modern life. To deny to
              human nature the parental instinct as a dominant factor in human life is a slander on
              humanity. To widen the scope of its activity by adding new afferent inlets, and to
              increase its efficiency by making the bodily and mental reactions more effective, is
              not defying but merely perfecting the nature of man.</p>
            <p>Should I approach a man with insulting words and threatening assaults, his pugnacious
              instinct will be aroused; he will experience the emotion of anger, and will probably
              give expression to his impulse to fight me, although his efforts to do me bodily
              injury may be cumbersome and ineffective. But suppose this man is later carefully
              trained and drilled in the art of self-defense or pugilism. Then suppose some one
              approaches with insults, jibes and threats. His same instinct of pugnacity will be
              aroused, he will experience the same emotion of anger and he will feel the same
              impulse to fight him, but he will fight in a much more effective and improved manner.
              Has his nature been changed? The answer is obvious. There is the same instinct, and
              the same emotion, and the same impulse to fight, but the fighting is done
              effectively.</p>
            <p>Now suppose the same man is trained and educated in a country where dueling is the
              established method of avenging insults and the thrown glove is the accepted method of
                <pb id="VAC1001-043" n="31"/>the challenge. Should a glove be thrown in his face, it
              arouses the same instinct, though the stimulus is vastly different. Here training has
              given another afferent inlet to the instinct of pugnacity. These illustrations should
              suggest how the instinctive processes may be adapted to the accomplishment of social
              and civic ends.</p>
            <p>What instincts are the most available for our purposes, is another question that now
              requires attention. This is not the place for an extended classification of instincts,
              nor, in fact, does an authoritative classification seem possible. Apparently there are
              as many classifications as there are writers on the subject. It is obvious, however,
              that the instincts generally described as the social instincts are the ones in which
              we are interested. The instincts and innate tendencies of this class that we find the
              most readily available are the parental instinct, the instinct of pugnacity, the
              sympathetic tendency, and the self-regarding sentiment.</p>
            <p>It is from the parental instinct with its tender emotion that are derived most of the
              nobler impulses, the feelings of compassion, and the spirit of altruism. Here, indeed,
              are unexploited possibilities for the building of civic character. McDougall argues
              that it was the operation of this instinct that led to the abolition of slavery and
              serfdom. Benjamin Kidd argues that the extension of political democracy was due to
              this instinctive source, since it frequently came as a voluntary gift from those who
              possessed the power.</p>
            <p>The history of great reforms along the line of humanitarian legislation in the United
              States is replete with striking illustrations. The agitation for the prohibition of
              poisonous phosphorus in the manufacture of matches required a long and patient
              campaign of education before a sufficiently effective public opinion could be
              mobilized in its behalf. And yet surely this was the basis of a dramatic appeal that
              ought to have been immediately effective. One who had ever seen <pb id="VAC1001-044"
                n="32"/>a hapless victim of phosphorous poisoning never could forget it. The
              pictures of these human derelicts were published in the public prints. The statistics
              were given the widest circulation. Every intelligent person must have been aware of
              the inhuman practise as well as of the simplicity of the remedy, for a harmless
              phosphorus could be substituted for the other at but slight additional expense. Why
              then the delay?</p>
            <p>Were the American people lacking in parental instincts? Were they indifferent to the
              useless suffering and agony of others? Were they too absorbed in their own pursuits to
              offer aid to the helpless in distress? None of these inquiries seem to touch the vital
              spot. Our people had not been trained to see the social significance of government.
              They had not been trained to feel a deep personal responsibility for its failure or
              success. They were not accustomed to connect up in their minds the tragedies of
              industrial disease with inefficiency in government. They had never felt any
              responsibility for human suffering unless chance threw it before their very eyes. With
              ostrich-like naivete they went on the happy principle that what they did not see, for
              them did not exist. In short, the afferent inlets to their instinctive natures were
              adjusted so as to arouse their emotional activity only when the human suffering was
              presented to their actual gaze. Herein lies the explanation of the apparently
              unchivalrous and brutal attitude of the public.</p>
            <p>It was only when public propaganda had painted the picture of the horror and
              suffering with life-like reality, only when by constant repetition and graphic
              description the situation was made vivid and specific, only when the real
              responsibility of the citizen as the only means of stopping the inhuman practise was
              brought home with resistless logic and dramatic appeal, that there were established
              new afferent inlets, through which this appeal of human suffering could <pb
                id="VAC1001-045" n="33"/>gain access to their tender emotions. They then felt the
              instinct to action, to protest, to aid the objects of their emotion. When they
              encountered the obstacles of legislative indifference, then their fighting instinct
              was aroused. Public indignation blazed forth, and the fight was won.</p>
            <p>This is a typical example of the history of a piece of ameliorative legislation that
              could be duplicated many times in the various legislative bodies throughout our
              nation. Had our people been taught in their youth the true significance of government,
              had they learned to look upon it as an instrument of happiness or weal, had they
              become accustomed to identifying in their minds the functions of governments with the
              deepest interests of humanity, had they learned the true significance of the story of
              the Good Samaritan as applied to the realities of modern life, their response would
              have been quicker and more effective.</p>
            <p>Nor must it be supposed that where there is an ultimate failure to gain a response
              from a given individual or group, that the necessary explanation is that the person or
              group is lacking in the parental instinct. For it is a matter of common observation
              that many men who are devoted fathers and husbands and genial and sympathetic
              neighbors, are wholly lacking in broad, altruistic or humanitarian impulses. These
              cases are doubtless due to a variety of causes, but among them generally lies the lack
              of early effective training, which might have given them the social view-point, and
              opened up new and various inlets in their instinctive natures, that would have made
              them both good citizens and better neighbors.</p>
            <p>There is scarcely an important topic in civics, in domestic history, or in community
              life, when accurately analyzed, that does not contain the possibility of an effective
              appeal to the parental instinct. These subjects thus have a special value as the
              medium through which the spirit of constructive <pb id="VAC1001-046" n="34"
              />patriotism may be developed, if taught in an effective manner. Moreover, it is where
              one gives them a dramatic setting and clothes them with the realities of life, that
              they become interesting to the student. It is significant that the subject of civics
              in the hands of one teacher is deadly uninteresting, while in the hands of another, it
              is fascinating in the extreme. The difference very frequently is that the latter uses
              civics as the means of establishing in the consciousness of the pupil new and
              absorbing contacts with life, thus enriching the sum total of his instinctive and
              emotional experiences.</p>
            <p>For example, one teacher will find in the study of the state legislature, its
              organizations and functions, only the dry skeleton bones of a legal institution, with
              certain definitions to remember, certain processes to master and certain details to
              organize. But there are no vivid contacts with life. The legislature is never filled
              with men of flesh and blood, men intensely human, like most men whom the pupil knows,
              men with pettiness and patriotism, and with selfishness and altruism, trying to deal
              with the real human problems that exist in every group. Many of these problems have
              roots that run deep down into the noblest and the worst passions of human nature.
              These conflicting passions present a fascinating and unending struggle that is typical
              of life. Decisions are made that touch life at a thousand different points. A teacher
              who does not see in such a situation the opportunity of bringing home to the boy or
              girl an increasing sense of the social significance of government and politics, who
              does not find a way of awakening the nobler instincts and emotions to effective
              action, and who does not establish new points of contact between society and the
              instinctive nature of the individual, is indeed asleep to his possibilities as a
              leader, and blind to his opportunities as a teacher.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-047" n="35"/>
            <p>It was my lot to study civics under a teacher who failed to see. She was a woman of
              marvelous character and personality to whom I am indebted for much in other ways, but
              who lacked the training, the imagination and the background to make the subject a
              vital human one. I committed important provisions of the Constitution; I learned the
              qualifications of various officers; and I mastered the dictionary meaning of
              legislature, executive and judiciary. But I never dreamed that any or all of them had
              anything to do with life. I never imagined that some of the most dramatic and
              significant conflicts of history had been won and lost in legislative halls. I never
              conceived that right in my native community we had conflicts of interests, absorbing
              human problems, that the community solved through these instrumentalities of
              government. As I write, I can not recall a single emotional thrill that I ever
              experienced in my high-school course in civics. In my boyish mind there was no
              conceivable connection between patriotism and politics. Could a training for
              citizenship have been more barren, impotent or sterile?</p>
            <p>Let us now consider the instinct of pugnacity with its emotion of anger as one of the
              instincts to be utilized in the development of citizenship that is socially
              responsive. The instinct of pugnacity is in a way dependent upon the other instincts.
              It is most readily excited by meeting opposition to impulsive actions impelled by
              other instincts. One's tender emotions are aroused by the appearance of a suffering
              child, and there is the immediate impulse to give comfort or relief. Should one
              encounter opposition in ministering to the child there is at once excited the instinct
              of pugnacity, and the emotion of anger. This instinct is of great social importance in
              supplementing the parental instinct and providing for it the great moral forces
              created by righteous indignation. As McDougall has well observed, both "in the <pb
                id="VAC1001-048" n="36"/>nursery and in the school righteous anger will always have
              a great and proper part to play in the training of the individual for his life in
              society."</p>
            <p>It is obvious that the parental instinct alone would be a weak force upon which to
              lean for the aggressive, constructive patriotism demanded by the exigencies of modern
              life. It is the anger arising from the opposition to the tender impulses that produces
              the power we need. Righteous indignation, when intelligently controlled and directed,
              is an indispensable force for social betterment, and its cultivation and direction
              become, therefore, an object of our deepest concern.</p>
            <p>The wave of popular indignation culminating in the national prohibition amendment is
              an excellent case in point. It is doubtful if the appeals to the other instincts alone
              would have accomplished the same result. The public had a general desire to remove the
              worst evils of the liquor traffic, and many efforts of one kind or the other were
              being made. It was when these efforts met with stubborn and hostile opposition that
              the public began to be aroused. When the liquor dealers lost all sense of discretion
              and decency, openly flaunted the authority of the government, ruthlessly and corruptly
              sought the control of political parties, and defied the public will&mdash;then it was
              that they met their Waterloo.</p>
            <p>It was the same in the campaign against poisonous phosphorus in the manufacture of
              matches. With the realization of the useless suffering involved, the public began to
              become concerned. They expressed their desires in resolutions to Congress, and a few
              wrote personal letters urging the justice of the cause. The movement might have proved
              abortive at this very point but for the suggestion that the impulse of the public to
              grant relief was meeting with opposition from indifferent congressmen and from certain
              special interests that were obviously concerned. A mild <pb id="VAC1001-049" n="37"
              />interest quickly gave way to righteous anger. Men who were only casually interested
              arose in wrath and the law was passed.</p>
            <p>The opportunities for the employment of this splendid social force and its
              intelligent direction are too numerous to mention, and yet they are too frequently
              ignored. They have not only a great social value but an equally great pedagogical
              value. Normal individuals exult over an opportunity to experience righteous anger.
              Significant movements in history, the solution of community problems, the development
              of political issues, if clearly analyzed, disclose continuous opposition to all the
              movements that have been prompted by the better impulses of men. This opposition may
              have been due to ignorance, bigotry or greed, and it affords a splendid opportunity to
              organize the instinctive and virile emotions of youth against the forces of reaction.
              It would be difficult to imagine a greater service to society than to equip its youth
              with a righteous scorn against these fundamental ills.</p>
            <p>When taught in this manner the subjects of social science, found in the public-school
              curriculum, take on a vital aspect. They develop the gripping interest of the drama.
              The local history of a city or a rural community becomes a deadening monotony, if it
              amounts merely to the marshaling of chronological events, but if it is the story of
              conflicting forces, an accurate account of the ceaseless battle between progress and
              reaction, as it found expression in the terms of local issues, it becomes an absorbing
              tale. It enables the student to begin the formulation of his personal philosophy
              amidst the stimulating and wholesome influences of the realities of life. He
              instinctively begins to estimate public questions in terms of social values, and his
              whole instinctive nature becomes adjusted to functioning upon the problems of his
              every-day environment.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-050" n="38"/>
            <p>We now come to the consideration of sympathy as a valuable innate tendency to be
              utilized in the development of constructive patriotism. Sympathy is not an instinct,
              perhaps, within the meaning of our definition, but it is an element in human nature of
              great social significance. It is probably a product of the parental instinct, the
              gregarious instinct, and certain egoistic tendencies. Whatever its accurate
              psychological analysis may be, its meaning for our purposes is obvious enough.</p>
            <p>The functioning of the sympathetic tendency seems to be twofold, the experiencing of
              fundamental emotions whenever the same emotions are witnessed in others, and the
              desire, on the part of one, to share his emotions with others. Every one has
              experienced a sense of distress upon viewing the grief of others, or has felt the
              distinct influence of infectious laughter on the part of his associates. So likewise
              most of us desire to share great emotional excitement with others. Music, the drama,
              inspiring scenery, good news and all such things that arouse strong emotional
              response, we like best when we share them with friends, and there is generally present
              on all such occasions a decided tendency so to do.</p>
            <p>The social utility of sympathy consists in the fact that through the tendency,
              emotional states spread very rapidly through society and thus affect public opinion
              much more quickly than would otherwise be possible. Thus in the campaign against
              poisonous phosphorus, when the leaders of each community began to evidence certain
              emotional hostility, it began to spread to the crowd much more rapidly than it would
              be possible to reach them by a campaign of education. This is also accentuated by the
              natural desire of those who felt the heat of burning indignation to impart their
              feeling to others. The missionary attitude and the <pb id="VAC1001-051" n="39"
              />altruistic spirit of the pioneers in humanitarian enterprises are largely the
              product of sympathetic natures.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the capacity of a community or a group to cooperate successfully in public
              undertakings, a capacity that is essential to democratic success of any kind, is
              conditioned very largely upon the existence of broad and effective sympathies, while
              one can not hope to become an effective leader of the public unless possessed of
              sympathetic tendencies that are virile and profound.</p>
            <p>The nourishing and developing of this tendency thus plays a vital part in the
              preparation for citizenship. We have already seen something of the opportunities for
              appeals to the social instincts that the social sciences afford, and the development
              of those instincts is the foundation of strong sympathetic tendencies. Perhaps one
              other concrete example will suffice.</p>
            <p>A very splendid teacher of high-school civics always takes her class to visit the
              orphans' home, among the other public institutions of the community. This particular
              visit was utilized to bring home to the pupil a keener realization of the human
              significance of local government. Nothing appeals to the sympathies more than the
              conception of homeless orphans. Nothing, perhaps, could bring home more vividly to
              youthful understanding the tragic significance of inefficiency in the local
              government, for it then becomes to them a very real and a very human institution. No
              longer was it a mere matter of formal rules and legal technicalities, but the parent
              and guardian of helpless orphans. Here an efficient government meant a happy home,
              kind treatment, effective training, good food, and a wholesome childhood, while
              inefficient government meant sorrow, tragedy and impotence. Just a few of these
              every-day illustrations, available in every community, in the hands of a skilful, <pb
                id="VAC1001-052" n="40"/>sympathetic teacher, will bring to every boy and girl a new
              understanding of the significance of civic duty. There will follow inevitably an
              increased interest and a growing sense of personal accountability that good government
              so imperatively demands.</p>
            <p>The self-regarding sentiment ought now to be briefly considered, since it plays an
              important rôle in the social life of the individual. It is not an instinct or an
              innate tendency, but is rather the product of some of them as their perceptual and
              motor aspects have been modified by experience. The self-regarding sentiment is the
              organization of the emotional disposition and experiences centered around the subject
              of one's self. The two dominant factors in the creation of this sentiment are the
              influence of society in establishing a system of rewards and punishments and sympathy
              with its influence toward a harmony of feeling and emotion between individuals.</p>
            <p>It is this sentiment that gives us such a high regard for the praise and blame of our
              fellow men and for moral approval and disapproval in general. This may be developed
              into regard for an ideal which may dominate life, even to the extent of violating the
              opinion of the community. The development, training and direction of instinctive and
              emotional life, and its innate tendencies, and their organization into the most
              altruistic and ennobling sentiments, is the very essence of patriotic education.</p>
            <p>This sentiment is capable of being extended, and generally is, to all the groups with
              which the individual has any intimate association and special interest. Thus it is by
              the extension of this sentiment to one's family, church, college, community, or nation
              that one finds his actions profoundly influenced by the interests of these groups and
              their claim to his fidelity. The opportunities for the direction of this sentiment in
              its extension to the community and to the <pb id="VAC1001-053" n="41"/>nation are
              almost without limit. The ties of human interest between the individual and the modern
              community are so many and so vital that one finds on every hand the materials for
              civic training. Our failures have not been for want of opportunity or of material, but
              a failure to see the vision and to analyze the task. A pedantic or scholastic point of
              view and an interest in the subject-matter has too frequently obscured the fact that
              our main objective must be the training of the boy or girl for the gigantic tasks of
              every-day democracy. The teaching and materials that do not contribute directly to
              this task, do not meet the demands of modern life.</p>
            <p>We have seen that a sentiment is, in the words of McDougall, "an organized system of
              emotional disposition centered about the idea of some object" and that "the
              organization of the sentiments in the developing mind is determined by the course of
              experience." We have seen how the materials of the curriculum, particularly the social
              sciences, afford unequaled opportunities for appeals to the more social of the
              instincts and their accompanying emotions. We have seen how these can be trained to
              function in connection with the study of the communities in which we live. We have
              seen the sentiment of patriotism dominate our land and exact immeasurable toll of
              human sacrifice. We have gloried in the splendor of our patriotic fervor. Animated by
              its generous impulse our men have risen to heights of valor and achievement that the
              world will not forget. The gallantry and courage of our troops have left nothing to be
              desired. This magnificent example should serve us as a guide.</p>
            <p>The splendid patriotism thus evidenced has been a sentiment of war. It has been
              developed by the study of the heroism, the glory and the tragedy of the battle-field.
              Love of country has been identified almost exclusively with <pb id="VAC1001-054"
                n="42"/>national strife. Our task is to develop a sentiment of constructive
              patriotism, not only concerned with the noble duty of its defense, but primarily with
              the opportunities of its perfection. It must be developed by the study of the heroism,
              the glory and the tragedy of the conflicts of peace. Love of country must be
              identified in the public mind with the unending struggle against ignorance, bigotry
              and greed. Patriotism must become a passion that marshals its host against
              unemployment, poverty and disease. It must organize its forces against domestic
              injustice with the same terrible energy that it directs them against our foreign
              foes.</p>
            <p>Such an undertaking is indeed difficult but its importance is monumental. If it is
              possible to say that the murder of innocent persons in the race riots of Chicago is as
              great a blemish on our national honor as the killing of our citizens by the bandit
              gangs of Mexico; if it is fair to argue that the useless destruction of life and limb
              by preventable industrial accidents in America is as great a crime against
              civilization as was Spain's cruel and inhuman treatment of the Cubans; if we may
              justly reason that some of our ghastly excesses of mob law are no greater crimes
              against humanity than were the atrocities of the Boxer revolt in China, then why may
              we not develop a patriotic sentiment that will function as resistlessly against these
              domestic evils as it does against our foreign foes?</p>
            <p>The creation of this sentiment of virile constructive patriotism, which is the
              essence of dynamic Americanism, must be the mission of the teacher.</p>

            <p>"<hi rend="b">T</hi>HE remedy for the evils of democracy is more democracy." I sat in
              a great theater and heard an eloquent statesman utter these words in clarion tones. I
              heard the audience reply with deafening applause. I saw them follow with slavish
              credulity the deductions he drew from this ringing declaration. Without thought or
              hesitation they had accepted the fundamental premise. To have questioned it would have
              shown a lack of confidence in democracy, a lack of faith in the American ideal. The
              words had an appeal to the imagination and emotional life of the hearers and they
              responded with unquestioning conviction.</p>
            <p>As I pondered over the incident and the marvelous effect of the apparently
              self-evident assertion, my mind reverted to the days of carpetbag rule in the South. I
              remembered that the negroes had just been freed from slavery, and that in the very
              dawn of the new liberty, without education, training or experience, and burdened as
              they were with ignorance, superstition and poverty, the ballot was placed in their
              hands. They were thus given the balance of power in the politics of the southern
              states. The abuses of this power, the corruption of the government, the unparalleled
              extravagance and dishonesty that followed, are without precedent in the history of
              free governments.</p>
            <p>The reign of terror and incompetence was only ended when the intelligent people of
              these states, taking the law into their own hands, wrongly or rightly, denied to the
              ignorant negro the rights that he had been given. It was only <pb id="VAC1001-057"
                n="45"/>when statutory and constitutional provisions had been defied, and fraud and
              intimidation employed, that the new civilization of the South could be erected upon
              the ruins of the old. As these incidents were passing through my mind, I wondered if
              the remedy for these particular evils of democracy was really more democracy. I
              wondered if the direct primary, the referendum, the initiative, or the recall would
              have solved the problem. I wondered if all that was needed was merely the extension of
              more political power to the unfortunate race that became the victim of its own
              ignorance and inexperience.</p>
            <p>I could not escape the conclusion that in this case at least the remedy for the evils
              of democracy was a more intelligent, experienced and better trained electorate. For
              when the average was improved by the forceful elimination of the unfit, the evils
              disappeared.</p>
            <p>Then again my mind wandered to Mexico, and I thought of the distress, anarchy and
              chaos that seemed to rule the destinies of our southern neighbor. I remembered that
              her constitution was as democratic as our own, and that her people were living under
              the form of popular government. I recalled the hopeless ignorance of the populace and
              their careless, care-free life, and I asked myself again, if in this case, the remedy
              for the evils of democracy was more democracy. Would all the instrumentalities of
              popular control, if placed in the hands of the ignorant and inexperienced people of
              Mexico, usher in a new régime of order, justice and peace. Or could there be a real
              and effective democratic government, competent to deal with the gigantic problems of
              modern life, without a regenerated citizenship, clear-eyed, intelligent, sincere.</p>
            <p>Then my thinking brought me nearer home and I recalled watching an election in the
              first ward of Chicago. I saw the denizens of the cheap boarding-houses, who had been
                <pb id="VAC1001-058" n="46"/>collected and boarded without expense to themselves in
              order that they might be voted on election day, pass in to exercise their right of
              franchise. I saw the citizens of the ward reelect their feudal and beneficent overlord
              and political boss, a man who befriended the voters personally, but who protected the
              system of vice that corrupted their morals, menaced their homes and debauched their
              children. And then again I wondered if the remedy for this evil was more democracy and
              greater popular control. Or was the remedy to be found in cleaning up the district,
              educating the children, eliminating the inherently unfit, and establishing a more
              healthy environment for the young citizens of the future?</p>
            <p>And yet a vast intelligent audience had accepted this doctrine as a panacea for the
              social and economic ills of our democracy. Their attention was thus diverted from the
              great eternal problem of civic training and popular education, while such fundamental
              tasks as seeking the remedy for unemployment and perfecting a just and righteous
              system for the distribution of wealth, were brushed aside in the naive confidence that
              these problems would be solved when the new devices of popular government had been
              installed.</p>
            <p>And yet a moment's critical observation would have shown the inadequacy of such a
              doctrine as a modern panacea. Abundant evidence to the contrary was available to all
              if they had only used it. The audience responded with fine enthusiasm and emotion but
              failed to display habits of critical analysis or thought.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately this failure to think seems particularly true of politics. Some one has
              said that the average man refuses to think critically about the two things in life
              that affect him most, politics and religion. I have seen men who think critically and
              carefully about their business, about their games, about their avocations, but who are
              "thought <pb id="VAC1001-059" n="47"/>tight" when it comes to politics. They accept
              the traditional dogmas of their party or their party heroes. They accept plausible
              theories without question, if they emanate from sources that are orthodox. All the
              complex political judgments of their lives are made by their reference to a few trite
              "rule of thumb" political platitudes or plausible, euphonious sophistries.</p>
            <p>It follows that the organization of instinctive and emotional life into fine
              sentiments of constructive patriotism can not take place without certain intellectual
              capacities and qualifications. What does it avail society if the public conscience is
              aroused to an emotional pitch against certain inequities of our economic life, if we
              seek only to establish some new instruments of popular control and leave the problem
              still unsolved? The development of an effective sentiment of constructive patriotism
              implies habits of critical observation and analysis, an evolutionary point of view,
              and a passionate love of truth. Unless these mental traits can be developed, our
              emotional life, instead of being a great constructive force, will play slavish tribute
              to the power of demagogues. The demagogue can seek no greater boon than a strong
              emotional response when not directed with intelligence and understanding.</p>
            <p>The reign of the demagogue is based upon appeals to those whose emotions are normal
              but whose credulity is greater than their powers of critical analysis. Nor is
              demagoguery always the product of dishonest intent, for it is only too frequently that
              a man makes the appeal in the best of faith, not realizing its inherent impotence.</p>
            <p>It is not unusual for an honest man, in the exigencies of a political campaign, to
              make the contest turn upon such issues as "Shall the People Rule," although in truth
              and in fact such question can not honestly be involved, and the issues concerned are
              side-tracked and forgotten. Many an <pb id="VAC1001-060" n="48"/>honest man has thus
              innocently played into the hands of designing politicians or special interests, whose
              success depended upon diverting public opinion from the real issues that were at
              stake.</p>
            <p>In a recent political campaign there was circulated a piece of literature appealing
              to farmers and workmen. The party claimed credit for the high prices the farmer
              received for cattle, hogs and grain, and impliedly promised a continuation of the
              same, while a little later on, the worker was assured immediate relief from the
              increasing cost of living. How prices were to be maintained and the cost of living
              lowered at the same time did not vex the committee or apparently scatter doubt among
              the electorate.</p>
            <p>Again the ease with which political parties have assigned the blame for hard times,
              bad crops and industrial depression, or claimed the credit for good crops and
              industrial prosperity, demonstrate the blind credulity with which many of us accept
              the statements of our favorites.</p>
            <p>So long as these things can be done demagogues will prosper, the real vital issues
              will be avoided, and the most sinister influences in our political life will
              frequently escape political responsibility through campaign alibis. As long as the
              public mainly accepts any issue indicated by the demagogue that appeals to popular
              imagination, these alibis will be open to those whose real interests would spell
              defeat, were they known to the electorate.</p>
            <p>Another evil resulting from the failure to acquire critical habits of observation is
              the tendency to surround historic incidents and characters with the sentimental
              glamour of unreality. A humorist has referred to this as the Lavender and Old Lace
              method of history. Such impressions as that Washington never told a lie, that the
              early days of the republic were more glorious and unsullied by selfish and corrupting
              influences than now, and that the public men <pb id="VAC1001-061" n="49"/>then were
              purer, nobler and more admirable than to-day, are typical examples.</p>
            <p>The evil of such a course is that it robs history of the fascination of reality; it
              destroys the perspective of the child; it must in time dull his love of truth, and
              finally lays the basis of a later cynicism. A boy or girl who goes out into the world
              to-day, equipped with such conceptions of life, comes very promptly to his
              disillusionment which is both painful and costly. When he finds that in government
              to-day and even in our popular heroes there is sometimes selfishness, bigotry,
              pettiness and occasional dishonesty he is unprepared for the sudden shock. He may lose
              all confidence in the government and society. Wholly lacking in historical perspective
              he does not see things in their true light. He has no reasonable standard of values,
              and it is but a short step to hopeless cynicism. There are several men among my
              acquaintance who have this attitude, who say openly that they never vote, for it is
              useless. Ignorance, dishonesty and greed are bound to triumph. Such a position is only
              possible among thinking men when they have no historic perspective in which they can
              see the slow but steady advances that have characterized our national life.</p>
            <p>This does not mean that children should not be taught to honor and admire our
              national heroes, but rather that the admiration should be wholesome, just and honest.
              For example, the teacher who can not see adequate ground for the warmest kind of
              admiration and pride in the actual achievements of the framers of the Constitution is
              woefully lacking in imagination, historical perspective and accurate understanding of
              that significant achievement. It is not necessary to paint those pioneers as men
              inspired from heaven, able to achieve perfection. It is not necessary to attribute to
              them qualities of heart and mind that they did not possess. The magnitude of the
              problem, the hard-<pb id="VAC1001-062" n="50"/>headed practical way in which they
              approached its solution, the courage and self-confidence with which they ventured upon
              untried paths,&mdash;these are sufficient grounds for all the glory that they so
              richly deserve. Moreover, these are the same qualities of heart and mind that the
              citizenship of to-day requires.</p>
            <p>The remedy for these two evils of demagoguery and cynicism is to be found in forming
              habits of critical observation and analysis. Here the instinct of curiosity must be
              employed, and its possibilities are without limit. The amount of time and energy that
              children will devote to puzzles is significant, and yet civics, if properly presented,
              becomes an interesting series of puzzles or problems to be solved by critical
              observation and analysis. The fact that these problems are human ones, with dramatic
              settings, greatly increases the possibilities of attention.</p>
            <p>The political philosophy or the democratic theories of the fathers affords an
              excellent example. If one is merely told that those theories will be found in the
              Declaration of Independence and the public addresses of the day, and they are to be
              taken at their face value, no problems are presented, no critical attitude is
              developed, no instincts aroused. But let the student approach the problem in its real
              setting. Let him become interested in finding out and formulating the philosophy of
              the fathers. If he begins to rely too much upon the obvious meaning of the Declaration
              of Independence, ask him if that document was a product of deliberation and counsel.
              Was it adopted as an accurate statement of their beliefs? Or was it adopted to
              accomplish a definite mission, <hi rend="i">viz</hi>., to provide a platform around
              which they might successfully rally the forces of the revolution? When men draw up
              such statements, in times of stress and strain, do they generally strive to say just
              what they think or do they seek to say what will catch the popular imagination? <pb
                id="VAC1001-063" n="51"/>What about the declaration that all men are created equal,
              and the subsequent recognition of slavery in the constitutional convention? In
              arriving at a man's philosophy, do we accept his own words as conclusive, or do we
              examine them in the light of his activity and conduct? What, then, did the fathers
              think about equality and democracy and political philosophy?</p>
            <p>By these and similar suggestive questions the pupil's instinct of curiosity may be
              aroused and habits of critical observation and analysis become established. With this
              same method applied throughout, the student will be prepared to form intelligent
              judgments when required to do so in the performance of civic duty. When he is trying
              to determine for which political party he will vote, he will not accept at face value
              the high-sounding phrases of party platforms. He will not take campaign promises as
              the sole criterion for decision. He will not accept the candidate's version of the
              issues that are involved. He will compare party promise with party performance. He
              will subject the high-sounding promises and platforms to critical analysis in the
              light of all the facts that are reasonably available. In short, he will be able to
              vote intelligently. Surely this is a necessary step in the intellectual preparation
              for citizenship.</p>
            <p>The pupil who studies civics or history by this method soon becomes enamored with his
              task. When he discovers that he is dealing with the real forces of politics, that he
              is trying to unravel the tangled fabric of our political life, the subject will cease
              to appear to him as pedantic and artificial but as fascinatingly realistic. It takes
              on a new dignity and importance that wins his respect, challenges his man-hood, and
              absorbs his interest.</p>
            <p>One word of caution should be given. In emphasizing the importance of a critical
              attitude and the evils of credulity, <pb id="VAC1001-064" n="52"/>care should be taken
              not to resort to the cheap methods of the muck raker, in which everything is
              questioned and everybody's motives but his own are impugned. To be honestly critical
              and to withhold one's judgment until the matter has received careful thought and
              analysis with an open mind, is one thing. To develop a morbid spirit of cynical
              distrust is a wholly different thing.</p>
            <p>This morbid desire for scandal perverts one's judgment and defeats one's own effort
              to know the truth. There are any number of individuals who have this peculiar mental
              twist, whose bias has poisoned the minds of many, and, unfortunately, some of them are
              prominent reformers. A few years since the writer attended a public lecture given by
              Carrie Nation. She was heaping indiscriminate condemnation upon all those in power. It
              was during President Roosevelt's second term. A member of the audience spoke out in
              protest, calling attention to Mr. Roosevelt's sterling qualities as a man and as a
              citizen. He then called attention, by way of clinching his argument, to the position
              taken by Mr. Roosevelt on the subject of large families and race suicide. Carrie
              Nation promptly retorted, in that stage whisper that betokened the giving of secret
              but authoritative information, that Mr. Roosevelt's attitude on race suicide was due
              to a secret contract with the brewers, by which he had agreed to get the mothers of
              the country to raise more sons in order that the brewers might have a larger market
              for their beer. She undoubtedly was sincere, but a type of mind that would conceive,
              believe and propagate such a notion is neither wholesome, scientific nor
              intellectually honest. It becomes a positive menace. The way to avoid this is to
              emphasize the importance of evidence, to keep open-minded, to be reasonable in
              judgment, and to develop a saving sense of humor.</p>
            <p>We come now to consider the evolutionary point of view. <pb id="VAC1001-065" n="53"
              />This means that our ideas of truth and life are relative and that they change and
              enlarge with our expanding wisdom and increasing experience. This view regards society
              and government as a constant process of development or evolution in which is found the
              ceaseless operation of the law of cause and effect. In such a conception, government
              is not an end of human endeavor, but a mere means to the realization of mankind's
              higher destiny.</p>
            <p>The necessity for the development of the evolutionary point of view as a part of
              civic training and the development of patriotic sentiment, is to be found in the evils
              of the static mind. This type of mind is possessed by the stand-patter. It does not
              recognize growth, development or evolution as essential. Its ideas are fixed, static,
              bigoted. It considers existing ideas and conceptions as entirely adequate and correct,
              and rejects the evidence of new experience and more developed vision as dangerous and
              necessarily incorrect.</p>
            <p>The development of the juvenile court movement in this country affords a tragic
              example of the operation of a static mind. Our criminal jurisprudence was developed
              very largely out of a retributive or vengeance theory of punishment. It assumed all
              criminal acts to be intentional, wilful violations of the moral or criminal law, for
              which no one was responsible save the wrongdoer, and upon whom society should wreak
              vengeance, in order to satisfy and keep alive the retributive impulse or tendency, and
              incidentally, to restrain crime by making evil-doing a poor bargain to the doer.</p>
            <p>With the industrial revolution, the growth of great cities, the disappearance of
              apprenticeships, and the coming of the city slums, this extremely individualistic
              theory seemed to operate with unnecessary harshness and injustice in certain cases,
              especially when juvenile offenses were concerned. In the case of children, reared in
              hopeless city <pb id="VAC1001-066" n="54"/>tenements, surrounded by vice and
              immorality, where their only heroes were likely to be the successful sneak thief or
              the painted woman of the streets, it seemed that their criminal tendencies were
              frequently the inevitable product of early training and environment, for which they
              were not morally to blame, but for which the community itself should answer. To take
              these young offenders, because they had copied the only life they knew and learned to
              violate the law, and lock them up for long sentences with hardened criminals, seemed
              not only unjust but unwise. It seemed unjust, for in many cases they could not be
              subject to moral blame. It seemed unwise, because the experience, during the plastic
              years of youth, of being imprisoned with adult criminals, seemed almost sure to
              condemn them to a life of crime, while to treat them as pathological cases for
              investigation and correction, seemed to afford better security against their
              depredations in the future.</p>
            <p>The concrete operation of the theory was well illustrated in a western state where a
              juvenile court law had been established. The facts are given below as reported by the
              judge who tried the case. A young lad with nameless parentage was a "hanger-on" in a
              saloon. A bright gamin of the street, he won the affectionate regard of those who knew
              him. The saloon was his home where he rendered such services a young lad might, and
              received in turn the alms of its patrons. He frequently delivered drinks to private
              residences. Having done so on one occasion, and having been given a generous drink by
              the woman to whom delivery had been made, he became intoxicated and threw a rock
              through a window in the home. The woman had him arrested. Under the old law this lad
              might have been imprisoned for a considerable period, with hardened criminals, for
              malicious trespass.</p>
            <p>But under the juvenile court act the procedure was <pb id="VAC1001-067" n="55"
              />different. He was brought before the juvenile court. The judge had a probation
              officer investigate the circumstances of the youth's life, as well as the facts in the
              case. The whole investigation resulted in the trial, conviction and punishment of the
              woman and the bartender for contributing to the delinquency of a youth, and the
              location of the boy in a good home, where he rapidly responded to the influences of
              the new environment and subsequently became a successful probation officer of the
              court.</p>
            <p>It would be difficult to find a cause that would seem easier to plead at the bar of
              public opinion. Here certainly was a vital institutional change that afforded a
              splendid appeal to the parental and pugnacious instincts. But despite that fact
              progress was slow and success frequently uncertain. The difficulty lay in the fact
              that the proposed change encountered the static mind. The change ran counter to two
              "rule of thumb" precepts that most people regarded as fixed and eternal. These two
              precepts were "spare the rod and spoil the child" and "an eye for an eye and a tooth
              for a tooth." The static mind loves its precepts more than it loves truth and
              humanity. Consequently the public hardened their hearts to the appeal when they saw a
              conflict with established precept. They thought more of their theories than they did
              of their children. The change could not take place until by a long and patient process
              these precepts were limited or undermined, and the public thus freed from the tyranny
              of phrases. It is thus evident that the development of instincts and emotions, if it
              be effective, implies the training of the intellect into proper habits of thought and
              action. No more formidable obstacle can be imposed to impede the progress of society,
              than the habitual bigotry of the static mind.</p>
            <p>Another example is found in the campaign in Chicago prior to 1904 for the abolition
              of the justice of the peace <pb id="VAC1001-068" n="56"/>courts in that city, commonly
              known as "justice shops." Because of the peculiar legal and constitutional provision
              of Illinois, some of the "justice shops" of Chicago were notorious for corruption and
              tyranny. There grew up the brazen and corrupt practise by which certain alleged
              collection agencies would enter into a corrupt bargain with some of the justices of
              the peace. The justices would make out copies of blank judgments and executions,
              signed and stamped by the courts, and sell them by the hundreds to these agencies.
              They would fill in the names of the poor and ignorant in these false papers, fill in
              the amount of the fake judgment, and give them to a corrupt constable who would serve
              the papers and collect the money specified therein. If the poor ignorant victim did
              not pay, his goods were seized and sold, and the robbery was made complete under the
              forms of law. This was done, though the poor victim had never been in court and never
              owed a cent.</p>
            <p>If the victim were intelligent enough he realized that he had redress in the county
              or circuit court in a suit at law. But such a suit took time and money, and frequently
              cost the plaintiff more than he had lost. Also the offending constable was frequently
              a worthless individual, with no property, and against whom a judgment would be
              impotent. In 1904 there was one constable against whom over fifty indictments were
              pending, and against whom suits totaling over two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
              had been filed.</p>
            <p>As a result of this pernicious system, justice was bought and sold at the expense of
              the poor and ignorant. Their homes were invaded, their scant savings dissipated, their
              property was stolen. This had gone on for years. The newspapers and magazines joined
              in occasional crusades against these inhuman practises. Voluntary and civic bodies
              made elaborate investigations, published the results, and demanded immediate and
              adequate reforms. The files of the Chicago <pb id="VAC1001-069" n="57"/>papers prior
              to 1904 contain repeated stories of these terrible abuses. The Cook County Grand Jury
              time and time again called attention to the situation and demanded appropriate
              action.</p>
            <p>In the meanwhile the evils were continuing in the face of an informed but an
              apparently indifferent public. The poor people of Chicago, whose conceptions of our
              courts of justice were mainly confined to their experiences in these "justice shops,"
              were being trained in a school of bitter experience that would produce only contempt
              for law and justice.</p>
            <p>Here was a case where the whole controversy necessarily depended upon an effective
              appeal to the generous emotions. No selfish appeal would be effective, since the
              intelligent members of the community, who wielded political power, escaped the evils
              of the system. The fraudulent collection agencies were too shrewd to attack any save
              the hopelessly ignorant. Should one desire to use a justice court on legitimate
              business, there were many justices of the peace who were efficient and trustworthy,
              and one could take his choice. Only an appeal to the social instincts, therefore,
              could produce the required results.</p>
            <p>The circumstances certainly afforded ample basis for the appeal. But it encountered
              the static mind, and the tyranny of an established phrase. The justice court had been
              known for time immemorial as the "poor man's court" because of the pettiness of its
              jurisdiction and the simplicity of its procedure. When its abolition in Chicago was
              advocated and the establishment of the municipal court was proposed, it encountered a
              tremendous obstacle. To abolish the "poor man's court" seemed to the unthinking and
              the uninformed a deliberate thrust at the rights and prerogatives of the unfortunate
              poor. It was true that the municipal court was to have, among other things, the
              simplicity of procedure and <pb id="VAC1001-070" n="58"/>the petty jurisdiction that
              had given the justice court its peculiar name. It was also true that the prime purpose
              in supplanting the "justice shop" with the municipal court was to protect the poor and
              ignorant against intolerable abuse and tyranny. The remarkable and conspicuous success
              achieved by the new judiciary bears enduring evidence to the keen foresight and
              statesmanship of those who founded it.</p>
            <p>Despite these facts, public opinion was successfully rallied to the defense of the
              "poor man's court." Intelligent men refused to think but accepted blindly the
              influence of an established phrase. The very men who were being exploited rallied to
              the defense of the instrument of their oppression. For a considerable time the most
              popular and potent argument against the change was the influence of this single
              phrase. Thus they sacrified substance for form, justice for a tradition, and reality
              for a name. Thus the static mind barred the possible inlet into the instinctive life
              that alone could yield results. Finally it was broken down and the reform splendidly
              and constructively achieved, but had the leadership been less intelligent, industrious
              and determined, it would have failed.</p>
            <p>It must not be supposed that the evils of the static mind are restricted to the
              conservative. It is frequently found in its most pernicious forms among the radicals.
              The slavish worship of trite phrases and the substitution of panaceas for critical and
              constructive thought, is a common error among the ranks of radicals. The naive
              dependence upon the maxim that "the remedy for the evils of democracy is more
              democracy" is an excellent case in point. Innumerable instances may be cited where men
              have staked all their hope of social progress upon some particular reform such as
              proportional representation, the single tax or a particular brand of socialism. Not
              only that, but instances <pb id="VAC1001-071" n="59"/>may be cited where socialistic
              legislators have actually opposed remedial legislation, though admitting its
              efficiency, because it was not consistent with a theory, or might weaken their party's
              power. In such a case theories are given a greater value than life, and party strength
              is preferred to social progress.</p>
            <p>Perhaps a warning should be given here against the idea that the alternative to a
              static mind is the creation of a desire for change. Nothing could be further from the
              truth, though it is an easy mistake to make. The remedy is not a mind predisposed to
              change, but predisposed to observe critically, to analyze accurately and to think
              sanely.</p>
            <p>Another common manifestation of the evils of a static mind is found in the failure of
              many to regard government as a means to an end. They think of it only as an end within
              itself. To such a person the primary purpose of government is to preserve itself in
              its existing particulars. Any change is to be vigorously opposed, therefore,
              regardless of its merits. The true purpose of government, however, is generally
              conceived to be to serve the highest interests of its people and of humanity, and the
              test of any proposed change is its effectiveness in the accomplishment of this great
              end. Its purpose is not to vindicate any set principles of government but to serve
              mankind.</p>
            <p>In a small city in the Middle West a group of intelligent leaders became interested
              in the project of establishing supervised playgrounds and recreational opportunities
              for all the children in the city. It was a backward community and there was much to be
              accomplished. The general moral and social conditions among the children were
              discouraging. Young boys frequented questionable places of amusement, and the
              evidences of general moral delinquency were startling. A comprehensive program was
              planned which would make it possible to reach every child in the public <pb
                id="VAC1001-072" n="60"/>school, and continuous service was arranged during the
              summer when the loitering children most needed such attention.</p>
            <p>In the course of time the plan became involved in the fortunes of local politics, and
              it became an issue in a public election. There were arrayed against it such special
              interests as the saloons and the pool-rooms, but the measure seemed assured of popular
              support, until an opponent discovered one day that the plan was "socialistic." That
              was the argument that defeated it. It is improbable that many of the persons in the
              city had any definite idea as to what it meant to be "socialistic," or as to whether
              the proposed program could be honestly so described. That was not essential. In the
              minds of many it was the prime function of the community to kill anything called
              "socialistic" and to that end the community quite cheerfully sacrificed the moral and
              physical well-being of the children. They misapprehended the real and only purpose of
              government. They determined their action by a false and inadequate standard of values.
              The only legitimate question before them was whether or not the proposed program was a
              sane and effective means of helping their boys and girls, and of serving the highest
              interests of their community. Until they are able to analyze this fundamental issue
              and to apply a standard of real values, they are not prepared for the intelligent
              performance of civic duty.</p>
            <p>How may this evolutionary point of view be developed? The illustrations of the
              operation of the static mind should afford some suggestions, for the student having
              the problem vividly presented to him will at once be interested in its solution. The
              instinct of curiosity should be continuously employed by the use of suggestive
              questions and the setting of problems. Nothing should ever be studied, no institution
                <pb id="VAC1001-073" n="61"/>considered, without inquiring as to the facts and
              conditions that gave it birth.</p>
            <p>In the early part of this chapter the question of the theory of democracy held by the
              fathers was suggested as an excellent problem for training the student in critical
              observation. Having come to his conclusions, then ask him from whence those theories
              come. What experiences and conceptions produced them? What are the present theories of
              democracy? What are the changes? What tendencies or forces caused the changes?</p>
            <p>In like manner let him trace through the conception of liberty, as used in the
              revolutionary days, and compare it with liberty as used to-day. Take the conception of
              suffrage, at first granted only to a very small and select class of adult males, and
              now granted to all normal persons of adult years. Why has it been done? What forces
              produced it? What tendencies are thus exhibited? The student soon gets the idea that
              things are relative; that a conception that seemed adequate and true a century ago, no
              longer holds, and what we honestly believe to-day may be discarded in the light of new
              experiences and clearer vision on the morrow. A student so trained will have a
              reasonably sure insurance against bigotry and excessive credulity.</p>
            <p>No more fascinating problem can be set the boy or girl than the tracing out of cause
              and effect in the development of the life of the community, national and local. And
              yet how rarely is this adopted as the habitual method of instruction? The study of
              local rural government affords a splendid opportunity. How many children have received
              the impression that the New England town meeting was adopted by the Puritans of New
              England as a result of their love of liberty, while the county commissioner system,
              prevailing in the South, was due to a disdain for <pb id="VAC1001-074" n="62"
              />liberty, that might be expected from a people who were a little tardy in their
              conversion to the gospel of emancipation. Yet this cheap exploitation of sectional
              prejudice has been by no means uncommon.</p>
            <p>How much more instructive and effective it would be to call attention to the
              different types found in the different sections, and set the problem of explaining how
              the two different types happened to develop as they did. The student would learn that
              the Puritans of New England found themselves surrounded by hostile Indians, the land
              unsuited to agriculture, and commerce and manufacturing the main occupations. The
              result was that they lived together in the stockades for safety, and had no occasion
              to scatter out on farms or plantations. Living together under such circumstances it
              was inevitable that their simple problems of community life should be discussed and
              settled in local meetings. It was not a matter of conviction to the cause of liberty,
              but an obvious convenience under the circumstances of the case.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, in the South the situation was just the opposite. The land was
              well suited to agriculture, the natural system of waterways enabled the settlers to
              scatter far throughout the land, and the friendly character of the Indians made
              possible the isolated life upon the plantation. Under these conditions community
              business could only be conveniently transacted by the representatives of the people,
              meeting at a central place. A town meeting would be highly inconvenient and
              impractical, if not impossible. This tracing of cause and effect is not only a
              fascinating problem, it is the only method that makes history and government real and
              vivid, that presents a true perspective and develops the evolutionary point of
              view.</p>
            <p>The absolute reversal of governmental theory that occurred among the fathers in the
              short period intervening <pb id="VAC1001-075" n="63"/>between the drafting of the
              Articles of Confederation and the adoption of the Federal Constitution presents a
              striking opportunity for the employment of the problem method. Under the Articles of
              Confederation there was no central government, no executive, no authority. The people,
              impressed by the British conflict between Parliament and the Crown, were skeptical of
              executive power. They viewed with suspicion any proposal for a central government lest
              it impair the right of the colonies and the liberties of the individual. But only a
              few years later the same people ratified the Federal Constitution, creating one of the
              strongest executive positions at the head of government to be found anywhere, giving
              the central government full and plenary power over foreign affairs, military and naval
              matters, interstate and foreign commerce, and many other matters of general concern.
              Moreover they conferred upon the central government adequate authority to enforce
              whatever powers the Constitution had conferred upon it.</p>
            <p>This direct and sudden reversal of policy presents an interesting problem that can
              not help but arouse the interest and enthusiasm of the class. Its solution will be
              found in the experience of the colonies under the Articles of Confederation. There is
              a fascinating story of the hostile competition between the thirteen original and
              discordant colonies. Naturally suspicious, they vied with one another, with
              competitive zeal, in the shirking and evasion of the taxes, and other duties levied
              upon them by the Continental Congress, and violated any treaty that might be made when
              it seemed to their advantage so to do. Each state, trying to gain wealth at the
              expense of its neighbor, levied excessive duties and erected discriminating barriers.
              Moreover, there were controversies over boundary lines and land claims that threatened
              serious bloodshed.</p>
            <p>The result was that the public peace was threatened, <pb id="VAC1001-076" n="64"
              />commerce was impeded, treaties were flouted, national debts were unpaid, and
              national dishonor threatened. Intrigue, selfishness and disorder seemed the order of
              the day. The evils had to be corrected. Order had to follow chaos. The national honor
              had to be preserved and public obligations paid. Commerce between the states had to be
              free and unrestrained. Its regulations had to be uniform and impartial between the
              states. The military and naval forces had to be placed under centralized authority,
              and dependent upon the power of government, rather than upon voluntary offerings, in
              order to be efficient.</p>
            <p>However much the fathers may have been devoted to theory, above all things they were
              practical. The reversal of governmental theory was the inevitable result of the
              teachings of practical experience. When their theories did not work, they were wise
              enough to abandon them. In spite of the obvious opportunity afforded by this incident
              in our constitutional history, in a group of some fifty teachers of civics recently,
              not a single teacher had ever thought of utilizing it. Is it any wonder that we
              develop static minds, that civics is uninteresting, or that civic training is
              inadequate?</p>
            <p>The writer has visited the classes in civics of a teacher who approaches all the
              important topics of civics, both contemporary and historical, with the problem method
              and from this point of view. This teacher has never had difficulty with the problem of
              interest or attention. In working out the solutions to these problems, the students
              have learned to use all the information at their command, as well as their own
              observation and experience. The recitation room is a laboratory to which every student
              brings the materials of his information and thought to be carefully worked over by the
              teacher and the group. The writer has never seen such instincts of curiosity as this
              class disclosed. <pb id="VAC1001-077" n="65"/>Superficial explanations did not
              suffice. They handled their materials with a self-confidence and an interest that
              seemed nothing short of remarkable. They were a group of thinkers, and were receiving
              the exact training that every citizen ought to have. What can be done with this class
              can be done with other classes, whenever we can get teachers with background, with
              imagination, and with a deep sense of responsibility, to do the work.</p>
            <p>The development of critical habits of thought and the evolutionary point of view
              bring with them a valuable byproduct that is most important&mdash;a love for the thing
              that we call truth. No student can be directed along these habits of thought, in the
              daily effort to discover the realities of life, in which their discovery is made the
              immediate object of their effort and the measure of their success, without developing
              a genuine appreciation and attachment for truth. Habits of intellectual honesty become
              established, which will have a deep personal as well as social significance.</p>
            <p>The development of these intellectual traits, as a necessary part of civic training,
              should now seem obvious in the light of the illustrations afforded by our political
              history. One might have the most marvelous instinctive development, the finest and
              most generous emotions, the keenest native intellect, but, unless one also has the
              capacity to see life as it is, to interpret and understand its unfolding truths, to
              analyze the confusing evidence and to keep his head clear amid the glamour and
              confusion of party strife, he might still fall an unwilling prey to the demagogue's
              persuasive pleas.</p>
            <p>The political contests into which our young citizens are emerging promise now to be
              the most bitter that America has ever seen. The stakes will be larger. The leaders
              will be more determined. Issues will be presented in the confused and delusive light
              of class and economic bias. In the <pb id="VAC1001-078" n="66"/>tempestuous storm that
              we see approaching, the pressure will be tremendous. Short-cut solutions to
              fundamental problems will be urged. New conceptions and values will be pressed for
              consideration and adoption. In the midst of these perplexing problems, the citizen of
              the future must be prepared to find his way. With keen and accurate analysis he must
              penetrate the confusing issues, he must discover the real and fundamental difficulty,
              and with a clear head and an open mind, he must struggle with the gigantic problem of
              their just and equitable solution.</p>

            <head rend="center sc">THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF GOVERNMENT</head>
            <p><hi rend="b">I</hi>N THE stress and strain of reconstruction, with its ominous spirit
              of unrest, its radical and revolutionary tendencies, and its spirit of challenge to
              the very foundations of society, the evolutionary point of view is increasingly to be
              desired. A long time view of government, as a process of social evolution, is the only
              adequate safeguard against the myopic attitude induced by the intensity of immediate
              problems. Moreover, the evolutionary view-point affords the only intelligent basis for
              the accurate formulation of a political theory and the solution of social
              problems.</p>
            <p>This view-point, however, can not be imparted at the teacher's will. It can not be
              convincingly established as a problem in formal logic or a demonstration in
              mathematics. To be effective it must become a habit of thought, a point of view whose
              foundations are deeply imbedded in habits and experiences. Like the technique of a
              musician, it must become an automatic practise&mdash;the established, unquestioned
              method of procedure. Unlike the musician's technique, however, it generally can not be
              formally presented nor consciously acquired. This difficulty should be frankly
              recognized, and the hope of the immediate conversion of the pupil to this point of
              view should be abandoned. It may be accurately explained to the pupil. The concept may
              be accepted as proper, and may merit his approval even, but it does not become
              effective until he has acquired the habit of thinking in those terms, and has
              accumulated experiences, garnered through that method of approach.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-081" n="69"/>
            <p>This evolutionary point of view must, then, become a habit, fastened upon the pupil's
              intellectual life by its continuous and persistent repetition. I have seen teachers
              who rendered lip service to the idea, and who sincerely believed that they practised
              it effectively. At the beginning of the course in civics, they would carefully explain
              it, and follow it up by a few orthodox illustrations, and then proceed with the
              remainder of the work in its flagrant, though unconscious, violation. I once heard a
              teacher make a convincing exposition of the evolutionary point of view in the
              beginning of the course, and then proceed directly from that splendid beginning, to an
              uncritical discussion of the Federal Constitution, using the famous phrase of
              Gladstone in describing it as "the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time
              by the brain and purpose of man." She accepted these words at their face value, and
              construed them to imply that our organic law was not the product of experience, but a
              production, <hi rend="i">de novo</hi>, from the inspired genius of its framers.</p>
            <p>To this teacher the evolutionary conception, or point of view, was only an isolated
              bit of academic theory, to be memorized but not applied. The result was a fundamental
              misconception of the nature of human progress, the loss of opportunity to make the
              topic a group of problems of unceasing interest and fascination, and the development
              in the child of a static attitude toward life and truth.</p>
            <p>The topic of this chapter may not seem to have any special value or utility to those
              engaged in secondary education. Many will doubtless think it more appropriate for work
              of a collegiate or university character. From the view-point of content alone, this
              may perhaps be true. But in training citizenship, subject-matter and information are
              relatively unimportant. The thing we are interested in is the boy or girl. Their
              mental and moral development is the great <pb id="VAC1001-082" n="70"/>object of civic
              education. Civics, history, community study and the other parts of the curriculum, are
              but means to this definite end. That being the case, we should choose those subjects
              and topics which are best suited to the task at hand.</p>
            <p>For that reason, any discussion of government, politics, or society, might very
              profitably be introduced with the consideration of the present topic. The "taking for
              granted" attitude regarding organized society is extremely unfortunate. It permits and
              encourages the static conceptions of social origins. With this method, the student
              inevitably comes to his study of society with the idea that it is a machine, rather
              than a process; that it has been created rather than evolved. It naturally follows
              that the machinery of society is the center of attention. If there are social and
              economic ills, merely mend or repair the machine, and presto! the ills are gone.
              Panaceas are seized with great avidity, because they seem to bring perfection to the
              social organism. Reckless and impossible promises of demagogues are credulously
              accepted, because changes in governmental forms may be so easily perfected.</p>
            <p>Because of these factors, the hope and altruistic enthusiasm of each generation tends
              to be squandered upon impossible desires and Utopian programs. The agitation for the
              Australian ballot affords an excellent example. Its advocates contended that with its
              adoption the problem of democracy was solved. It was a tremendously important step,
              amply justified by subsequent experience, but it never began to accomplish the wonders
              so buoyantly prophesied. By concentrating their hopes and intentions so completely on
              this one reform, other matters of equally great importance were ignored, while the
              fundamental problem of civic training, as the only enduring basis of efficient
              democracy, was practically forgotten.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-083" n="71"/>
            <p>These conditions are inevitable, as long as our people are allowed to hold the
              static, mechanistic conception of government and society. If everybody were brought to
              see the truth, at the beginning, a different attitude would inevitably result. If the
              student realized that organized society was a slow and patient process of social
              evolution, operating throughout the ages; that the ideal and spirit of democracy have
              slowly and painfully evolved through centuries of human struggle; and that our own
              institutions of society are the products of generations of trial and error, in which
              our mightiest intellects and most courageous leaders have shown the way, they would
              sooner realize the impotence of panaceas, would waste less energy in the pursuits of
              political "cure-alls," and would recognize the profound and fundamental character of
              the problems of democracy.</p>
            <p>Nor would they necessarily become discouraged by the magnitude of the problem nor the
              slowness of its solution, for with the evolutionary approach, with the careful study
              of the forces of human development, there comes a profound faith in the ultimate
              progress of humanity. Such progress may be slow, but it is inevitable, and it affords
              an alluring appeal to those who will, to devote their zeal to the upward struggle.</p>
            <p>The effect of the artificial or mechanistic conception of the state is reflected in
              many of the suggested explanations of its origin, such as the theory of the social
              compact. This theory is that the state originated in formal agreement. People lived in
              anarchy or chaos until they entered into an agreement to create a state or government.
              This theory has been widely accepted, although a moment's critical consideration
              demonstrates its fallacy. In the first place, historic evidence of the theory is
              absolutely lacking. Secondly, the theory assumes the conscious idea of political
              organization <pb id="VAC1001-084" n="72"/>instead of explaining its source. As
              explaining the origin of organized society, it is, therefore, necessarily wholly
              inadequate. Finally, history affords no evidence of the relationship between the state
              and the individual being contractual, which would indicate very strongly that the
              state did not originate with agreement.</p>
            <p>In spite of these facts the theory has at times been widely held. It rendered
              valuable service at the time of the American Revolution, when much of the ethical
              justification of revolution was drawn from the premises afforded by the compact
              theory. It has indirectly served a useful purpose, also, in that it tended to
              emphasize the fact that government should exist for the benefit of the governed, which
              is sound American doctrine to-day.</p>
            <p>On the other hand it has worked no little harm. It has given us a conception of
              individual rights that tends to be too static and absolute. Such conceptions have
              blocked progress and impeded development. The temperance program, the prohibition of
              child labor, the effective regulation of monopoly, have all been greatly retarded
              because of the popular conceptions of private rights as dogmatic and absolute
              concepts, with which nothing should be permitted to interfere. Individual liberty and
              private right are the most precious possessions of our people. But their content is
              relative, not absolute. Their very preservation depends upon our ability to adjust
              them to the evolving needs and conditions of our national life.</p>
            <p>A conception of liberty which insisted upon the inalienable right of the child of
              tender years to sacrifice education, youth, health and character for a weekly wage, is
              a mockery of justice, while a conception that sought to preserve liberty of
              conscience, freedom of speech, and adequate safeguards against arbitrary and despotic
              power, is indispensable to democratic institutions.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-085" n="73"/>
            <p>Another false account of the origin of organized society, springing from the
              mechanistic conception of the state, is the doctrine of divine right, that governments
              were established by rulers who received their authority and power from God. While this
              doctrine has recently received startling support from the German emperor, it has long
              since been repudiated by democratic peoples.</p>
            <p>These and other impossible explanations of the origin of the organized state, are the
              products of a false attitude toward society. There is always the tendency to make it
              too conventional and too simple. The truth is that the origin of society can not be
              traced to any single cause or force. It is a complex of many forces, natural and
              spiritual, that have operated throughout the centuries, each force and century
              contributing its increment to the dawning consciousness of political life.</p>
            <p>The historical or evolutionary theory of the state is the one now generally accepted.
              It regards the state as the inevitable product of the reactions of the human instincts
              to the environment of nature. The instincts were the motivating forces, and the
              environment provided the conditions under which the struggles for the satisfaction of
              instinctive wants were fought. Conditions were such, that in time these wants could
              only be adequately supplied by some rude form of cooperative effort, and thus
              unwittingly the basis of political life was being laid. Professor Burgess has given an
              excellent statement of the theory. "It means," he writes, "to go a little deeper into
              the psychology of the subject, that it is the gradual realization, in legal
              institutions, of the universal principles of human nature, and the gradual
              subordination of the individual side of that nature to the universal side." In other
              words, individual interests gradually were subordinated to the necessities of the
              cooperative effort demanded in the struggle for existence.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-086" n="74"/>
            <p>This process becomes more significant and obvious as we trace in rude outline the
              various stages in the development of political organization. Professor Dealey has for
              the sake of convenience, treated this development as comprised of four stages, the
              formative period, the period of settled social institutions, the period of urban
              civilization, and the period of industrial civilization.<ref id="ref_001" rend="super"
                target="note_001">*</ref> Since this development has been largely conditioned upon
              the economic factors in the environment, economic periods were adopted as the basis.
              This classification will be followed here in our discussion.</p>
            <p>In the early part of this period man was doubtless little removed from the other
              animals in his manner of life. There could have been no political consciousness, no
              cooperative effort, no exercise of forethought. Complete dependence must have been
              placed upon the bounty of nature for food and nourishment. Property and law in their
              most elementary forms had not yet appeared. Whatever family life there was, was of the
              natural matriarchal type.</p>
            <p>From these rude conditions, man's capacity to learn, to generalize from observation,
              and to profit by experience, enabled him to develop the beginnings of social and
              political life. Desire to satisfy instinctive want, in which hunger may have played a
              dominant rôle, provided the dynamic power. The pangs of hunger stimulated dormant
              intellect, and hunting was evolved as an additional method of securing food. With the
              development of primitive arms and tools, there began to dawn the idea of private
              property, though property in land was yet unknown. As hunting developed, there ensued
              competition for the better hunting-grounds, and thus there arose another need of
              forming into groups, in this case for the protection of the better <note id="note_001"
                  ><ref rend="super" target="ref_001">*</ref>Dealey, J. Q., <hi rend="i">The
                  Development of the State</hi>, Chap. II.</note><pb id="VAC1001-087" n="75"
              />hunting lands, against the aggressions of competing foes. When there were more
              interests to be protected, the advantages of cooperative effort for defense were
              obvious, even to the most primitive of intellects.</p>
            <p>Thus men united in loosely organized groups, frequently called hordes, brought
              together primarily for the purpose of obtaining food, and providing for mutual offense
              and defense. These forces were supplemented by the more primitive of the social
              instincts. In such groups leadership, authority, custom and similar notions, in their
              most elementary form, were necessarily developed. But a civilization, resting upon an
              economic basis so insecure, could not develop great strength, endurance or permanency.
              Consequently their conceptions of property, custom and political organization were
              necessarily vague, uncertain and indefinite.</p>
            <p>In reaching the second period, characterized by the development of settled social and
              political institutions, the same fundamental principles seemed to have prevailed. It
              was the same old process of subordinating individual caprice to the necessities of
              cooperative effort. Customs, laws, authority and institutions did not develop except
              by degrees, and to the extent that the contending masses of humanity found them useful
              aids in their struggle for existence.</p>
            <p>One very important step, doubtless, was the discovery that animals might be
              domesticated. Thus, by the exercise of forethought and self-denial, men found they
              could protect themselves against the days of scarcity. The effect of such discovery
              upon the methods of life and organization was fundamental. The flocks of domesticated
              animals became tribal property, which brought individuals into much closer relations,
              by increasing the immediate interest and stake that the individual enjoyed in the
              strength and wealth of the group. Transient hordes thus became permanently <pb
                id="VAC1001-088" n="76"/>and closely united by the joint possession of a common food
              supply.</p>
            <p>In addition, the possession of such wealth aroused the envy and anger of hungry
              neighbors. The struggles for defense became proportionately more bitter. This required
              greater group efficiency for defense, and this necessitated stronger leadership, more
              definite authority, and greater individual subordination. Group boundaries became more
              definite, and the sense of group interests more firmly established. Custom and laws,
              tending to increase the strength and efficiency of the group, became established as
              the community of interest became more obvious, through the existence of common
              property, common needs and common foes.</p>
            <p>In such a civilization, with an accumulated food supply, there came moments of
              leisure, when the social and spiritual instincts of the race could find opportunity
              for primitive expression. Art, religion and similar interests began to be expressed,
              and moral conceptions to develop.</p>
            <p>An interesting observation has been reported, which brings home with unusual
              vividness the degree to which individual rights were subjected to group interests. It
              is said that in some of the primitive communities, it became the fixed custom for
              mothers to murder their female babies. In the savage warfare developed between the
              various groups, women were not useful. If a community had too many women, it would be
              captured and eaten, or subjected to slavery by competing groups whose membership
              contained a higher percentage of warriors. To meet this condition, the rule of female
              infanticide was adopted. Doubtless the mother's love for her offspring was as strong
              then as it is to-day, but it had to give way to the larger interests of the community.
              The identification of the individual's welfare with that of the community under the
              simple but strenuous life <pb id="VAC1001-089" n="77"/>that then prevailed, was so
              obvious and the necessity for the rule so clear, that obedience was secured.</p>
            <p>Herein lies, in part, the secret of respect for law, tradition and authority, that
              has prevailed from time to time among uncivilized societies. Conditions were so simple
              that the necessity for laws and their obedience, as a measure of self-protection, were
              apparent. In the complicated society of to-day, the relations between self-interests
              and community welfare are no longer so direct and obvious, though clearly equal in
              importance. Genuine respect for law and order did not originate in moral preachments
              upon the subject, but out of a keen realization of its imperative necessity to
              individual and community well-being. It does not seem unreasonable to suppose,
              therefore, that the same thing holds true to-day. Reverence for law and order will
              come now, only as it did originally, when we have made its importance clear to every
              mind. In the complicated conditions of to-day, it presents a more difficult problem
              and can be solved only by educational efforts. Train the child to see the human
              significance of government, what its failure or success may mean to him and to his
              loved ones, and let him be brought to the vivid realization that law, authority and
              government are but the instruments through which society cooperates for human
              betterment and progress. Obedience to law and order then becomes a mere matter of
              effective cooperation, and not a blind submission to authority. Out of this process
              and understanding may come a profound respect for established order as a conscious
              instrument of progress.</p>
            <p>Returning now to the question of the development of primitive society, perhaps the
              most important single factor after the domestication of animals, in rounding out the
              development of the period of settled social institutions, was <pb id="VAC1001-090"
                n="78"/>the advent of agriculture. This gave a great impetus to the growth of
              civilization. It may be supposed that the pressure of increasing population, the
              difficulty of finding adequate grazing lands for the expanding flocks, and the desire
              to vary the diet composed so largely of flesh, all combined to bring about the
              development of agriculture, as a necessary means of economic support.</p>
            <p>The social and political consequences of this development were enormous. People were
              not willing to sow unless they had some assurance that they might also reap. This
              meant the definite group ownership of definite lands with fixed and definite
              boundaries. It meant still greater interest in the methods of defense and offense. It
              meant more highly organized effort, and the beginning of the division of labor. The
              increased productive capacity of agriculture resulted in an increased density of
              population. Competition for the possession of the best agricultural lands also
              increased the necessity for more effective military efforts.</p>
            <p>The inevitable result of all of these centralizing and stabilizing forces was the
              slow evolution of the horde into the more complex and highly organized group commonly
              called the tribe. This change may have taken countless centuries, for the primitive
              peoples learned slowly, and there are some backward peoples on the earth to-day who
              have not even yet reached the period we are here trying to describe.</p>
            <p>These conditions, and the continuous wars that accompanied them, still further
              defined the notions of authority, law, order and obedience. Warfare required leaders
              with authority who might compel obedience. The increasing density of population
              brought on new possibilities of friction between individuals, which required the
              development of laws, customs and tradition, and the recognition of established
              authority within the tribe.</p>
            <p>The development of morals, supported by the public <pb id="VAC1001-091" n="79"/>
              opinion of the group, followed the obvious need of tribal warfare. Cannibalism was
              abolished in favor of slavery. With the agricultural period, came the need for
              increased labor, which was neither exciting nor attractive. It did not require a vast
              deal of intelligence to discover that an enemy captured in war would provide more food
              as a slave than as a meal, and consequently cannibalism became immoral, as contrary to
              the best interests of the tribe. This throws a significant light upon the origin of
              primitive morals, and affords a splendid introduction to the modern conception of
              social ethics. Slavery, which to-day is considered as a curse, was at one time a
              distinctly moral conception, and marked a great step in moral development. The
              question of ethics thus becomes an evolutionary conception, rather than a dogmatic
              rule. Through this study, the child is thus being unconsciously prepared for an
              intelligent, practical and enlarging conception of the great problems of our social
              and political life.</p>
            <p>With these developments came many changes in political institutions. The tribe tended
              to break into smaller units, frequently called clans, which settled into small, more
              compact, and more highly organized communities, adopting the patriarchal form of
              organization. Describing the organization of these communities, Professor Dealey
              writes, "The headship of the clan was vested in the oldest male of the leading family,
              but tended to pass from father to son. Religion secured a powerful hold on the mind by
              emphasis on ancestral worship. The family became permanent and definite, but included
              a wider range of kin than the modern family. The entire clan was virtually one great
              family looking to the head as the Patriarch or ruling father who guided and protected
              his children. They bore a common name, had a common system of worship and cultivated
              their lands and pastured their herds in common. Their disputes were <pb
                id="VAC1001-092" n="80"/>settled and their affairs regulated by the heads of
              households in joint session under the leadership of their chief. In this system each
              village community was itself a petty state voicing its sovereignty through the chief
              of the clan, who was assisted in his deliberations by the older and more influential
              men under his authority. Such a community by inter-marriage became closely kindred in
              blood and in social customs, and thus developed a homogeneous, autonomous,
              self-centered life, that gave wonderful permanence to that form of organization."</p>
            <p>These clans developed relations among themselves which finally culminated in various
              types of loose confederations, either through permanent alliances, or through one
              powerful community making itself superior over its lesser neighbors. Some form of
              inter-clan organization seemed inevitable, since intercourse between them was
              necessary, and such relations generally led either to hostile competition or useful
              cooperation, and the latter implied organization. Marriage alliances, commercial
              intercourse, common worship, and joint action for offense and defense in times of war,
              were the forces through which inter-clan organizations tended to develop. With the
              absorption of competing clans into the larger confederations, wars became less
              frequent by the lessening of the number of potential enemies, and the new
              organizations became more powerful against the enemies that remained.</p>
            <p>From such conditions tribal monarchies could easily develop. Permanence and stability
              were obtained. Public opinion became more articulate. Law, authority and government
              became still more clearly delineated. A sense of political consciousness had begun to
              dawn, and the elements of the modern state were thus slowly and rudely formed. In
              these communities, however, there was no distinction between state, family and church,
              for all were one. At the <pb id="VAC1001-093" n="81"/>end of this period, however,
              this distinction began to become apparent, and the state stood out as a separate
              institution, representing the organized political life of the community.</p>
            <p>The third stage of political life, known as the period of urban civilization, was
              largely the product of commercial forces. The advent of agriculture had greatly
              facilitated the creation of wealth. Men now produced a surplus above the bare
              necessities of physical existence, and this gave immediate stimulus to the process of
              barter and sale, which developed in magnitude and efficiency, under the new demands.
              New wants were created, and there developed commercial relations between communities
              producing and those desiring the products of the day. Improved forms of communication
              were established, mediums of exchange devised, and the special business of the
              merchant became established.</p>
            <p>In the wake of these developments came the city. Merchants established themselves in
              the midst of the fertile lands, in proximity to mining districts, or along the ways of
              travel. The termini of trade routes became centers of business, and here were gathered
              together the wealth and business interests of the community. Stopping places along the
              main channels of trade were established for the convenience of travelers, and these
              also became centers of urban population.</p>
            <p>By the cosmopolitan influences thus exerted through the forces of commerce, travel
              became common, while competition between groups stimulated mentality and inventive
              genius, created new wants, and accelerated interest in all phases of human
              development.</p>
            <p>Here were new interests to be served, new problems to be solved, new functions to be
              performed, for which the old established political and legal conceptions were
              inadequate. New laws dealing with barter and sale, medium of <pb id="VAC1001-094"
                n="82"/>exchange, private ownership of property, merchandising of goods, and
              innumerable other subjects were required. Commerce between clans and loose
              confederations became so profitable and common that rules and customs regulating such
              relations developed, and the basis of diplomacy and international law began slowly to
              develop. New problems arose with such rapidity and complexity that the slow developing
              customs and traditions, enforced largely by public opinion, could not keep pace. The
              process of consciously framing and promulgating rules and regulations for the solution
              of problems, developed while the old traditions and customs were frequently codified
              by public authority.</p>
            <p>The administration of public affairs increased so tremendously in importance and
              amount under these circumstances that public administration became a separate
              business, and a class of public officials followed. While, heretofore, the development
              of the state had been more instinctive than conscious, as humanity, struggling with
              the problems of nature, had instinctively gathered into such groups and developed such
              traditions as their daily experience demonstrated was essential to their existence,
              here they began to use their conceptions of the state, government and laws as valuable
              instruments with which to struggle with their common problems. This was a great step
              in the advancement of civilization, and enabled humanity to grapple more effectively
              with the questions that a rapidly changing social and economic life presented.</p>
            <p>As Professor Dealey observes, such development "demanded changes in political
              organization. The members of a conservative village community living in practically
              the same way as their fathers, might well continue the customs and habits of their
              ancestors. But when the population and wealth of the community increased by leaps and
              bounds, when strangers of wealth and brain capacity settled <pb id="VAC1001-095"
                n="83"/>in ever larger numbers within their borders, modifications had to be made.
              The village lord became a king, his little council became a great body of advisers and
              administrators, the petty business of the village became a mass of duties requiring
              the services of many hundreds. Then followed centralization of authority, codification
              of customs and introduction of business methods in administration, through the
              organization of great departments of state. Increasingly larger numbers of influential
              residents, whether native or foreign by descent, shared in the responsibility of
              government. Such modifications brought about the development of the city state, best
              known through the classic examples of Greece and Rome, but found in all early
              civilizations characterized by a developed commercial life."</p>
            <p>It was from the city states so developed that there arose the Roman empire, extending
              its control in all directions, and developing a monarchy much stronger and more
              unified than had been found before. The tendency toward centralization and expansion
              reached its crest in the rise of the Holy Roman empire, and the ambition of the papacy
              for temporal power. The failure of these schemes, together with the awakening spirit
              of nationality that occurred in the centuries that followed, resulted in the growth of
              civilization being directed again along the lines of national development.</p>
            <p>The fourth stage in the political development of the world, known as the period of
              industrial civilization, followed about the middle of the eighteenth century, with the
              application of machinery to the manufacture and transportation of goods. The
              advancement of civilization has always been dependent upon the supply of food and
              other material wants. Population easily increases under favorable conditions, but food
              and other material things come only by physical work and mental toil. All the great
              eras in human <pb id="VAC1001-096" n="84"/>advancement have been preceded by permanent
              additions to the food supplies. With such increases in the necessities of life, there
              are released great quantities of energy, before absorbed in the object of food
              getting, for new types of productive enterprise and mental effort.</p>
            <p>Thus with the tremendously increased production, made possible by the industrial
              revolution, marvelous social and economic changes were inevitable, and political life
              had to be adjusted accordingly. "As a further result of the development," again
              quoting Professor Dealey, "commerce has multiplied past all precedent, every corner of
              the habitable earth has become known and explored, hermit nations are forced out for
              better or for worse into western civilization, and governmental activity has expanded
              so as to meet new conditions. Larger interests, greater wealth and increased
              population give greater fighting power, and to the leading nations the old struggle
              for empire once more comes to the front. They strain every nerve to develop material
              and mental capacity, so as to attain supremacy in international competition; they seek
              to expand by extending their sway over nations inferior in attainment, and they
              readjust their political organizations so as to manage more wisely their great
              interests. In such an age as this political change is inevitable. World politics finds
              no place for the petty state, the backward nation, the ultraconservative people. Broad
              and high intelligence, moral energy, capacity for hard work and bold initiative and
              invention are the virtues of the age. Intelligence in the state involves democracy in
              the system; immense resources demand executive and administrative capacity; the
              necessity of accomplishing a desired end by concentrating every possible ounce of
              energy at the proper place, insures concentration of governmental power. Such
              capacities and virtues, in a struggle for national existence or world supremacy, are
              not matters of indifference <pb id="VAC1001-097" n="85"/>but necessities for survival,
              and hence the present age tends to develop a political life suited to the attainment
              by states of whatever will contribute to the highest development of their
              peoples."</p>
            <p>Another inevitable result of the conditions is found in the foreign policies of all
              foreign nations, including the United States. To-day all of their policies are based
              fundamentally upon considerations of economic imperialism. This is not necessarily so
              because they desire it, but because it is a necessary result of the condition of the
              world. It is essential to the maintenance of national strength and vigor. For
              instance, America is now an industrial, rather than an agricultural, nation. For some
              time we have been producing more manufactured goods than we have been consuming. That
              means that we must find a foreign market for our surplus, or our industries will
              decline, while the nation that sells to the markets of the world prospers in strength
              and wealth. Under the circumstances there is no other alternative, if America would
              retain her strength and power, than to enter into the world-wide competition for
              foreign trade.</p>
            <p>But this is a hazardous undertaking. It has been recently reported that seventy per
              cent. of the people of England live upon the profit of overseas commerce. That means
              that unless England can keep her share of the world's trade, a corresponding number of
              her people must either starve or live on the bounty of others. That in turn would be
              the end of British power. With England, it is a matter of life or death. What is true
              of England, is true to some extent of France, Belgium, Germany and Japan. For America
              to enter into competition with these great powers, for the very life-blood of national
              existence, is bound to lead to friction and toward another period of world
              conflict.</p>
            <p>These nations must have an assured access to the markets of the world. They must have
              increasing supplies of raw <pb id="VAC1001-098" n="86"/>materials to keep their
              factories employed. As they amass their surplus wealth, they must have opportunities
              for its profitable employment in the more backward countries. The amount of world
              trade at any one time is limited. The known sources of raw material are not
              inexhaustible. The opportunities for the profitable investment in backward countries
              are capable of being monopolized. No nation, including America, can afford to lag
              behind in this contest for survival. Consequently there has ensued the contest for
              colonies, for spheres of influence, for protectorates, and for special concessions
              among backward peoples.</p>
            <p>Under the circumstances, the position of the weaker nations, with valuable sources of
              raw material to be exploited, and affording potential markets for the future, is most
              hazardous and insecure. The scramble for trade and for empire makes another world
              conflict inevitable, unless the nations, appalled at the tremendous sacrifice that it
              exacts, conscious that any settlement so secured can be but temporary, can create an
              international organization, wherein the united forces of all can safeguard the
              security of each. If all the backward countries toward whom the great nations now look
              with envious eyes would have their independence thus assured, and no nation would have
              ground to fear that it would be monopolized by its competitor, a great source of
              danger would be removed, and a measure of equal opportunity in foreign trade might be
              assured to all the powers.</p>
            <p>Out of these conditions has come a movement for a league of nations, in which the
              nations prepare to unite to serve jointly their nationalistic purposes which they can
              not protect separately. For under the present régime, national life and vigor rest
              upon no more certain foundation than the fickle channels of trade and the accidents of
              modern wars, where alliances and ententes only add to the bewildering <pb
                id="VAC1001-099" n="87"/>uncertainties of military victories. The movement for a
              sane world organization thus rests, not upon any sentimental basis of
              internationalism, but upon the most far-sighted and practical nationalism.</p>
            <p>International organization, like all other forms of political institutions in human
              development, will succeed only in so far as it is an effectual instrument for serving
              human needs. This is one lesson that the story of the development of the state must
              not fail to teach. If the league of nations is to endure, therefore, it will be
              because it is an effective means of providing adequate safeguards to the peaceful and
              lawful development of the several nations. If it does not provide this, it can not
              endure.</p>
            <p>To those with the evolutionary point of view, who have followed the course of
              economic and social development, the need of some form of international organization,
              to save civilization from the wreck of future wars and the bolshevism that tends to
              follow in their wake, becomes self-evident. The political and organizing genius of the
              race, that has evolved the political ideas for the horde, the tribe, the clan, the
              city state, the nation and the world empires of to-day, must now create a political
              organization that will meet the immediate international needs of the great powers of
              the world. This is the next step in the great process of human evolution. If it does
              not come this generation, it will come the next. The opposition to the fundamental
              principles of such movements comes from those with static minds, who lack the
              evolutionary point of view. They regard change as unnatural. They rally around the
              battle cry that one can't change human nature. But the facts are that the basic
              elements of human nature make change and development inevitable. In this fact lies the
              hope of humanity. In these great world movements, in which men are struggling to
              secure new safeguards for civilization, and <pb id="VAC1001-100" n="88"/>new
              guarantees against the enemies of mankind, such movements as those looking to a
              practical world organization represent not the defiance of human nature, but the
              unfolding development of its divine splendor.</p>
            <p>The successive stages by which men have supplanted conflict with cooperation, license
              with liberty, and chaos with law, have evidenced with unmistakable clearness that the
              pathway of human nature is the pathway of progress, development and evolution. Those
              who, through selfish interest or hopeless ignorance, seek to oppose the progress of
              society, are the real enemies to the forces of human nature. They may impede but they
              can not stop its onward march. On the other hand, those who comprehend the nature of
              social progress&mdash;who have the evolutionary point of view&mdash;they are the ones
              upon whom society must depend for the vision, the energy and the leadership that will
              direct the contending forces and facilitate humanity's upward struggle.</p>
            <p>Not only is the knowledge of the nature and necessities of the modern industrial
              state essential to the understanding of the modern tendencies in diplomacy and world
              politics, but it is also indispensable to an understanding of the internal development
              of modern governments. The relative simplicity of our governmental machinery of a
              century and a half ago, as compared with that of to-day, is appalling. Has there
              developed a needless complexity in the mazes of which democracy is about to lose
              itself? Does it mean that we have lost our political moorings, and are wandering
              dangerously and needlessly along the pathway of paternalistic government and state
              socialism? These are questions that thinking people can not evade, and their answers
              can only be ascertained by inquiring into the underlying causes of this complex
              development. If we have only added new machinery of government to meet the problems
              that a rapidly <pb id="VAC1001-101" n="89"/>evolving civilization has presented, and
              we still adhere to the ideal of equal opportunity for all, there may be little cause
              for fear.</p>
            <p>One has but to contemplate the vast and revolutionary changes that have followed in
              the wake of the industrial revolution, to realize that the simple political
              conceptions of the fathers, while sound in fundamental principles, were wholly
              inadequate in detail for the modern problems. Before the industrial revolution, only
              about three per cent. of our people lived in cities, while to-day over forty per cent.
              live in cities of over eight thousand inhabitants. These cities, largely the result of
              the factory system, have been conditioned, both in their development, location and
              tendencies, upon considerations of economic expediency. It made no difference how
              unwholesome a place might be, how unsightly the surroundings, or how overcrowded it
              already was, if a great factory could be profitably established, because of its
              proximity to raw material, to distributing centers, or to unusual transportation
              facilities, there the factory was located, and there the men and women who depended
              upon factory labor for their living were compelled to live, whether or no.</p>
            <p>With such conditions arose new problems of public health, sanitation and tenements.
              Adequate safeguards against the spread of contagious disease to a degree unheard of
              before, now became essential. With the rapid growth of these industrial centers, came
              the tenement-house problem with its moral, physical and spiritual implications, which
              could not be ignored. In the congested areas, it became necessary to provide breathing
              areas, public parks and playgrounds, and to see that conditions prevailed that were
              conducive to health and morals.</p>
            <p>Public utilities were then established and their inseparable relation to housing,
              health, morals and the necessities of <pb id="VAC1001-102" n="90"/>life, at once
              required their regulation by the state. The constitutional rights of stockholders had
              to be protected, and the investment of private capital in such enterprises encouraged,
              but at the same time it was necessary to protect the public against inferior service,
              discrimination and excessive charges. This one problem alone has called for the
              development of much additional machinery and the end is not yet in sight.</p>
            <p>With the growth of the factory system and the division of labor, there came the
              problems of industrial disease, and industrial accidents. Despite the great progress
              already achieved, these two causes alone exact an annual toll of nearly one million
              victims.</p>
            <p>More fundamental and intricate than these examples, and the hundreds of others that
              might be cited, is the problem arising from the conflict between capital and labor.
              With the growth of the factory system, there came a tremendous increase in productive
              capacity. By virtue of inventive genius and the application of steam and machinery to
              the process of production and distribution, labor and capital increased their
              productivity by gigantic strides. Labor and capital soon became engaged in a
              controversy as to how the joint profit of their labors should be divided. Labor unions
              were formed to give to employees the advantages of collective bargaining in their
              demands for shorter hours, better working conditions and higher pay. So the struggle
              has gone on until to-day it absorbs the interest of the nation and threatens to
              paralyze our industrial life. To cope with different phases of this problem, new
              governmental machinery has been found essential and departments of labor, industrial
              commissions and other appropriate offices have been created.</p>
            <p>In all of this development many false steps doubtless have been made. Many things
              have been attempted that have <pb id="VAC1001-103" n="91"/>been impotent, if not
              positively harmful. Nevertheless the new problems were present, and if the government
              was to grapple with them, additional machinery and institutions were required. Under
              these new conditions the government could not become an effective instrument of
              distributive justice, it could not be the successful guardian of the public safety,
              health and morals, it could not protect the weak against the aggressions of the
              strong, without developing new and effective machinery, accurately adapted to the
              particular problems that were involved. This is as true of government to-day as it was
              of the governments in primitive days. Only those groups survived which succeeded in
              meeting the problems of their day and age, and no government can hope for permanence
              to-day, except by meeting the same inexorable law of social efficiency.</p>
            <p>From this brief survey of the development of government, there are two principles
              that should become so clear and obvious that they can never be forgotten. In fact, the
              main justification of the subject-matter of the chapter, is that it affords a splendid
              opportunity for the exposition of these principles. The first principle is the great
              social utility of law and order, or the value of established and orderly methods of
              procedure, as the surest and quickest route of social and political progress. This
              lesson is particularly needed at this time when the very atmosphere is redolent with
              the spirit of radicalism and unrest. As has already been observed, the remedy for this
              spirit is not in moral preachments, extolling the virtues of established order. It can
              not be based entirely upon superficial and optimistic appeals to altruistic endeavor.
              The reverence for law and order that will endure&mdash;that will withstand the stress
              and strain of modern life&mdash;must be based upon a profound conviction of its
              utility to one's self and to his group. This must be brought home time and time again,
              until it is <pb id="VAC1001-104" n="92"/>part of one's intellectual equipment, deeply
              embedded in mental habit, and until it has made its dramatic appeal, on the part of
              the group, to the individual's instinctive life.</p>
            <p>The whole history of political development has been an almost continuous process of
              enlarging the field of cooperative endeavor, and humanity has generally made progress
              only so fast as this has been actually accomplished. Primitive society could never
              have formed itself into the horde, or the tribe or clan, except by enlarging the
              cooperative effort. And this was done only by evolving and observing customs and
              traditions which later developed into laws. It requires but a moment's reflection to
              realize that only those groups, tribes or clans survived which followed the pathway of
              local laws. In the agricultural period a tribe that refused to obey the mandate
              against cannibalism, could not hope to stand out against the richer and stronger
              tribes who had profited by the rule. In the pastoral period, a group that refused to
              grant ready adherence to the rules laid down for the protection of their pastoral
              interests, could hardly hope to survive in a conflict with neighbors who enjoyed the
              superior wealth and power that flowed from intelligent obedience to law.</p>
            <p>The whole primitive struggle that has characterized the early evolution of
              government, was a constant contest for survival in which those groups that learned the
              value of law and order, as the basis of cooperative effort, finally survived.</p>
            <p>The other principle to be emphasized here is that political progress is conditioned
              upon the capacity of the group to change their established order, when necessary, to
              cope with new and changing problems. At first blush this principle seems contradictory
              to the idea of reverence for law and order, but the contradiction is only apparent and
              not real. Unfortunately, however, the two are frequently confused.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-105" n="93"/>
            <p>The man who is for law and order as a matter of temperament, rather than as a result
              of intelligent perception, is generally for the same reason against any change in the
              established régime. But the man with a dynamic mind and an evolutionary point of view,
              who believes in law and order only as a useful means to a desired end, will accept the
              second principle as a vital and necessary corollary to the first. And yet the facts
              are that many times important changes are opposed by the defenders of established
              order, when it is only through such change that the original purposes can be achieved.
              The controversy in Chicago over the abolition of the justice courts, discussed in the
              preceding chapter, affords a dramatic illustration. The justice court had become an
              outrageous instrument of tyranny and oppression for the poor and ignorant, and yet
              many who opposed the adoption of the municipal court in its stead, did so because they
              would not rob the poor of simple and inexpensive justice. Yet the facts are that this
              very change has given to the poor the simple justice that they desired, and saved them
              from intolerable abuse.</p>
            <p>In the primitive contest for survival, the remarkable operation of this principle is
              continuously apparent. As primitive society emerged from the embryonic horde to the
              pastoral stage, demanding new traditions and customs dealing with the care, ownership
              and defense of the tribal herds, any group that would have ignored these needs, and
              stubbornly clung to the simpler traditions of the earlier days, could not possibly
              have survived.</p>
            <p>So it was with the transition from the pastoral to agricultural life, with its
              requirements for a definitely organized group, with fixed boundaries, centralized
              authority, superior methods of defense, and laws governing the ownership and control
              of property. The group that declined to make the political changes necessary to meet
              these new demands, <pb id="VAC1001-106" n="94"/>must inevitably have been defeated and
              enslaved by those who had. And so it has been through all the vicissitudes of human
              progress, and so it is to-day. No more fundamental lesson can be taught to the young
              citizens of democracy than that the power, prestige and permanence of our great
              republic is conditioned upon our capacity so to adjust the details of our government
              and policy as to make America, amid the rapidly shifting problems of the coming years,
              an efficient guardian of liberty and justice.</p>
            <p>The teacher who can find a way of building into the dawning consciousness of youth
              the great fundamental conviction that the way of liberty, justice, and of progress is
              found in evolution; that though its process requires time, patience and tireless
              efforts, its rewards are ample; that the destiny of democracy depends upon the valor,
              the wisdom, the open-mindedness and the fidelity with which each generation grapples
              with the problems of patriotic duty; and finally that in the investment of one's
              energy and interest in this eternal struggle for human betterment, one finds life's
              rarest thrills and richest joys&mdash;such a teacher is building a foundation for
              democracy that will endure.</p>

            <p><hi rend="b">A</hi>N INSTRUCTOR once startled a teachers' institute with the dogmatic
              statement that there was no subject covered in the course of civics that could not be
              made one of absorbing interest to the student. An irate gentleman of many years'
              experience in the district school, took violent and voluble exception to the idea,
              concluding his remarks with the statement that it was his duty to teach, among other
              things, the government of his county. He was unable to see how that could be made
              either dramatic, interesting or palatable, and he would be very grateful to be shown.
              The instructor had just come from an institute in another county where one of the
              special speakers had been the county health officer. This man had shown that during
              the incumbency of his office for three years, he had reduced the number of preventable
              diseases among school children of the county over seventy-five per cent., and had
              reduced the annual number of deaths from such causes from nine to one.</p>
            <p>The instructor cited this as an example of the dramatic significance that attaches to
              one of the county offices, too frequently regarded as too insignificant for the
              teacher's notice or the public's interest. So true is this attitude of indifference
              toward this important office, that it is rarely filled with the best physicians, and
              not infrequently with the worst. I have been in not a few communities where an inquiry
              for the most incompetent physician and the local health officer, brought forth the
              same response. And yet upon his skill, energy and fidelity depend the life, health and
                <pb id="VAC1001-110" n="98"/>happiness of many. If the conscientious work of an
              unknown health officer, in a backward county, could save eight lives a year, surely
              the study of that office and its functions could be made both interesting and
              dramatic. And, what is fundamentally more important, if this were done, there can be
              but little doubt that these young citizens, as they emerged into years of political
              responsibility, would take a different attitude regarding the importance of the
              office, and the type of men who filled it.</p>
            <p>The teacher who found nothing of interest in county government, saw in that
              institution only a framework of statutory and constitutional provisions. He had missed
              entirely the graphic story of human need that brought the institution of county
              government into existence, and the significant and human functions that it performed.
              Doubtless his pupils would have borne out his testimony that the subject was
              monotonous and dull.</p>
            <p>The problems confronting this teacher would be greatly simplified, if not solved, by
              using the functional approach to all studies of the social sciences. This is the
              natural, psychological manner, and yet it is rarely used. It is the way the race
              learned, and it is probably safe to assume that the way they learned was, at least,
              the most natural if not the most direct. Primitive man began his first political
              thinking in the terms of the needs that confronted him. It was in the effort to meet
              these needs that the idea of political organization slowly developed and matured. This
              same method of learning should be followed in the school-room, if the best results are
              to be attained.</p>
            <p>There are three reasons why this method always should be employed. The first reason
              is that the functional approach enables the teacher to interpret and explain
              government and society in terms of the pupil's own experience. Unless this is done the
              pupil can not really comprehend. As <pb id="VAC1001-111" n="99"/>a student in school,
              I learned that the functions of government were divided into three groups or
              departments: the legislative, the executive and the judicial. I learned to define
              these in terms satisfactory to the teacher, but which were meaningless to me. The
              separation of the powers of government into these three groups touched nothing in my
              experience. It did not connect up with any of the realities of my life. It had no
              sense of importance for me. Under these circumstances, the teacher's efforts were
              largely futile.</p>
            <p>Suppose, however, she had used the functional approach to government. She would have
              shown, for instance, that to have schools and colleges in which people could be
              educated, required the cooperative effort of the community or the state. It was too
              great an undertaking for any one individual or family. Therefore, they had to join
              their forces to do jointly what they could not do singly. So the people established
              school boards, and school districts, and school trustees, and provided for the
              erection and operation of schools. This cooperative enterprise could only be
              accomplished by having laws adopted which would provide the basis for their joint
              efforts. For it is obvious that there could be no successful schools unless there were
              superintendents and teachers and some one appointed to employ them; unless school
              should be held at a given time and place, so children would know where and when to go;
              and unless the pupils would be divided into groups, according to age and school
              experience, so that each class could study the same subjects.</p>
            <p>Obviously, so simple a matter as a village school can not be operated without its
              school law, and its body of rules and regulations. But whence do these laws come? They
              are not automatic. They do not create themselves. They are, in fact, promulgated by a
              body of the representatives of the people, which body is called a legislature. This is
              a <pb id="VAC1001-112" n="100"/>very important department of the government that the
              people have created for this and similar purposes.</p>
            <p>This is the functional approach. It begins with the needs of government, needs that
              are so clear and elementary that they mean something in the pupil's experience. Then,
              proceeding from the known to the unknown, the pupil is taken from a consideration of
              the needs of which he personally has been made conscious, to the institutions of
              government that have been adopted to meet these needs. Now it may be reasonably
              supposed, the legislature has come to have some real significance in the mind of the
              pupil, and as this process is continually repeated, in dealing with the different
              functions and institutions of government, the understanding becomes more nearly
              adequate and complete. By this method, the educational process becomes a gradual
              unfolding of the pupil's realm of consciousness, and a gradual and natural broadening
              of the limits of his experience.</p>
            <p>But laws do not interpret themselves, and yet they must be interpreted for those who
              execute and obey them. And in spite of the fact that they may be very carefully drawn,
              reasonable men very frequently differ as to their meaning. And when men do differ as
              to their meaning, how shall this difference be decided? Suppose, for instance, that
              the school law provides that no teachers shall be employed who do not have one year of
              "professional training." The majority of the school board think that one X, who has
              had a year's work in a certain college, comes within the meaning of the law, and
              therefore authorize the superintendent to engage X as a teacher. The treasurer, who is
              responsible for paying out money from the school fund, in accordance with the law,
              thinks that X does not come within the meaning of the statute, that her contract is,
              therefore, illegal, and he refuses to pay her salary. If the different parties can not
              settle the controversy by mutual agreement, some <pb id="VAC1001-113" n="101"/>one
              must settle it for them, or the school may go without a teacher.</p>
            <p>Innumerable cases of this character are continually arising, and if there were no one
              who had authority to settle them, there would be interminable and intolerable
              deadlocks and delays in public business. To meet these needs, which, by well-chosen,
              simple illustrations, may be made very concrete and obvious, the people have
              established a system of courts, which constitute the judicial department of
              government, and it is the business of these courts to interpret and apply the law in
              all such cases, when properly brought before them. Through this approach, the
              judiciary has a real meaning to the pupil in terms of his own experience. Almost every
              boy and girl has had some games spoiled by disagreement over the meaning or
              application of the rules, and has found that if games which require close decisions,
              like baseball and basketball, are to be played satisfactorily, an umpire must be
              chosen to give authoritative decisions. Thus the idea of an officer, chosen to decide
              controversies and interpret and apply the law, may be made very real and significant
              to the normal pupil. To such a one, the judiciary does not mean a mere dictionary
              definition or conception, but a very real and essential part of the machinery which
              men have created to meet the demands of every-day life.</p>
            <p>Likewise, the executive department should be approached in exactly the same way. Even
              though men agree to the meaning of the law, they do not always do as the law provides.
              Disobedience to the law may be due to ignorance of it, to carelessness in regard to
              it, to forgetfulness, and to viciousness. Whatever may be the motive, society and
              civilization can not exist unless the laws are generally obeyed. How could a school be
              maintained if scholars came only when and where they wished, if teachers only taught
              what <pb id="VAC1001-114" n="102"/>and when they liked, and if school boards only paid
              or refused to pay the bills as the caprice of the moment might dictate? Only confusion
              and impotence would result. What is true of the school would obviously be true of the
              whole community.</p>
            <p>There is then a very real and apparent need in the community and the state for some
              one to be selected who will see to it that the laws are executed and obeyed. To meet
              this need, administrative and executive officers are created, and they compose the
              executive department of the government. The necessity for obedience to law is
              illustrated so clearly on every hand, that there would seem to be no difficulty in
              finding abundant illustrative material to bring this clearly home to the most
              inexperienced boy or girl.</p>
            <p>The second reason in favor of the functional approach in the study of society is that
              it, better than any other method, demonstrates the true nature of government,
              institutions and laws, <hi rend="i">viz</hi>., that they are useful means for the
              obtaining of certain ends. This involves one aspect of the evolutionary point of view
              that is quite essential. The individual, whose introduction to these subjects is made
              through an analysis of group needs, and the tracing of these needs through the
              cooperative effort to meet them, resulting in the formation of the institutions and
              laws he sees about him, can scarcely fail to grasp this point of view. In fact, that
              is the only conception that he obtains from this method of approach.</p>
            <p>One of the important results of this method is the proper appreciation of the nature
              and character of law. One of the reasons for the popular disrespect of law that seems
              to prevail among our people, is doubtless due to the narrow and restrictive meaning it
              has to the vast majority of minds. In the popular conception, law is identified
              primarily with the repressive and punitive measures that make up the <pb
                id="VAC1001-115" n="103"/>criminal law. And yet in both bulk and importance, the
              criminal law is but a very minor part of our system of jurisprudence. The great bulk
              of the law of the state has to do with laying down the rules that are to govern the
              rights and duties of the individuals, engaged in the great cooperative undertaking
              that we call organized society. These rules are not so much restraints upon individual
              freedom as they are the necessary basis of cooperative effort.</p>
            <p>In the course of modern events it becomes necessary to make contracts, create
              partnerships, erect great corporations, build vast enterprises, govern and equip
              cities, build and operate great school systems, and so on, and yet every one of these
              and the thousands of other like undertakings require rules and principles, defining
              all the rights of the millions of parties who are involved, and laying down legal
              requirements for their guidance. Law thus becomes a valuable instrument without which
              the fabric of our civilization could not be builded. Law is as essential to these
              mighty undertakings as are the rules of cards to a game of whist.</p>
            <p>The prevailing ignorance among educated people, regarding the nature and functions of
              law, is illustrated by a recent personal experience. A prominent professor of English
              in one of our great universities, having, for the first time in his life, become
              interested in a law pending in the legislature of his state, appeared before a
              legislative committee in its behalf. In discussing the bill he became confused by some
              of the technical language employed. He at once came to the quite common conclusion
              that such technicalities and refinements of expression were quite useless, in fact,
              positively vicious, for it was the usage of such language that made lawyers an
              expensive necessity, and led to useless litigation. He closed his outburst to me with
              the statement that he would "flunk" a member of his freshman class in composition, who
              could not draw a plain statute or write <pb id="VAC1001-116" n="104"/>a simple
              contract in clear language, so that no reasonable and honest court or man could have a
              doubt as to its meaning.</p>
            <p>I submitted to him the following simple agreement for his scrutiny and approval: "A
              and B agree, on this, the 25th day of September, 1915, that A purchase the spotted cow
              of B, known as Betsy, for $100, it being agreed that B will deliver the said cow to A
              on the 30th of this month, and that A pay to B the $100 on the 27th of this month." He
              thought that honest, reasonable men could have no doubt as to what it meant. But, I
              suggested, suppose that on September 28th, 1915, after the cow had been paid for on
              the 27th as specified, the lightning strikes and kills the spotted cow, Betsy, and on
              the 30th A demands the delivery of the cow, and on the failure of B to deliver it,
              demands the return of his $100, and damages for failure to comply with his agreement.
              What are the rights of the parties? Submit this question to any group of reasonable
              men, who are not lawyers, and you will find an honest difference of opinion, and yet
              here was as simple a contract as one could wish.</p>
            <p>The difficulty in drawing the contract was that the parties had not anticipated a
              very ordinary and possible event, <hi rend="i">viz</hi>., the unexpected death of the
              cow. To meet all of these emergencies which are bound to occur in great profusion and
              complexity, and to provide a basis of solution that is just and fair, and in which the
              public has confidence, there must be a carefully elaborated system of law. Without it,
              men would hesitate to enter into business relations. When disputes arose, as would be
              inevitable from time to time, if there was no law for their solution, men would be
              strongly tempted to resort to force and all the other evils of violent self-help. The
              fights in which small boys occasionally engage over disputed facts in a game of
              baseball, when played without an umpire, afford evidence of this tendency.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-117" n="105"/>
            <p>On another occasion a very intelligent and well informed man declared to an
              applauding audience that there was no reason why law should be intricate or complex.
              It was intentionally made so by the lawyers in order to create legal business. These
              superficial criticisms of our jurisprudence, all too common among our people, can not
              form the basis of a very intelligent citizenship, nor the foundation for a genuine
              respect for law. The child who has come to his study of government through the
              functional approach, who has seen the needs before he learned the laws and
              institutions created to provide for them&mdash;will recognize the simple and obvious
              fact that our laws are intricate and complex because the life that we live and the
              civilization that we enjoy are intricate and complex, and the law must provide the
              basis for both. Take as a typical example, one of our necessary institutions of
              to-day, a great railroad company, with millions of capital, building and operating a
              railroad across the continent. There are stockholders, bondholders, shippers of every
              class and description, contractors, officers, employees, passengers, freight, rolling
              stock, real estate&mdash;all part of the problem of transportation, and all having
              interests which must be protected by adequate rules of law. As one contemplates the
              veritable maze of personal and property rights that is involved in a single day's
              operation, one can not escape the conclusion that the genius that has devised a legal
              system for defining, limiting, securing and enforcing them with reasonable efficiency
              and satisfaction, has earned the gratitude, rather than the contempt, of humanity.
              There are defects in our laws, the same as in all human creations, that require
              ceaseless efforts to remedy. But the remedy will not be found in the growing contempt
              and disrespect for law that emanates from the fallacious and plausible tirades of the
              demagogue. It will come only when an intelligent electorate comprehends the real <pb
                id="VAC1001-118" n="106"/>significance of the problem, and demands of its public
              servants, constructive accomplishment instead of impossible pronouncements.</p>
            <p>The importance of emphasizing again and again the functional side of government, as
              laying emphasis upon the fact that humanity is concerned primarily with the ends
              achieved, rather than with the means employed, is evidenced by the general confidence
              reposed in popular votes and majority rule, as a remedy for public ills, or a solution
              of pressing problems. While this general problem received some attention in Chapter
              III, additional material along the same line here seems justified by the importance of
              the subject.</p>
            <p>When America was struggling with the problem of peace or war, one of the most
              important and momentous questions ever submitted to our government, a question whose
              intelligent decision had to depend upon a comprehensive understanding of the relative
              strength of the contending armies, upon the real ambitions and intentions of the
              German government and its people, and upon what vital relations already existed
              between America and world politics and what these relations might be in the years
              ahead, there arose the demand to submit this question of war or peace to a referendum
              vote. Let us contemplate for a moment the nature of this proposal.</p>
            <p>In the first place, a very important element in the solution of this problem was the
              probable outcome of the struggle if America did not enter. The great war was the
              outgrowth of world developments and competition, for which America was the least
              responsible of any of the powers concerned. While we soon recognized that the Allies
              were fighting on the side of law, international order and good faith, if the Allies
              could defeat Germany without our aid, would we not be justified in leaving them alone
              to solve the problem for which they were in large measure responsible? <pb
                id="VAC1001-119" n="107"/>Should we abandon the advantage of our natural isolation
              unless it became necessary to secure the defeat of Germany?</p>
            <p>But the application of this policy, if adopted, would involve the question of whether
              or not the Allies would need our aid to win. If we waited until the struggle was over,
              it would be too late. Indeed, as it was, there is evidence to believe that, had
              America been but a few months later, she would have been too late. To determine during
              the conflict which side would win, would require a careful study of the problem of
              strategy, the financial conditions of the contending countries, their probable food
              supply, the condition of the morale of both the armies and the peoples, and finally,
              of the secret information that the Allies would be willing to give to the government,
              but which could not be given to the public, because it would reach the enemy. To
              suppose that there could be an intelligent public opinion on such a question,
              involving so many items entirely outside the domain of the average man's knowledge or
              experience, surely does violence to one's imagination.</p>
            <p>But this is not all. To determine whether the suggested policy of entering the war in
              case it was necessary to secure the defeat of Germany, was or was not wise, depended
              upon another question, <hi rend="i">viz</hi>., what would be the effect upon the
              interests of America and the world, in case Germany should win. Obviously this
              depended upon the purposes, plans and powers of Germany in case of victory. It
              depended upon an intimate knowledge of German philosophy and German foreign policy, as
              well as upon the economic, commercial and diplomatic background of the whole European
              situation. How many citizens were able at the time the question of war or peace was
              pending, to give an adequate judgment upon those complicated facts? With our
              traditional ignorance of foreign affairs, how many citizens could have <pb
                id="VAC1001-120" n="108"/>hazarded an intelligent guess, or even comprehended the
              outstanding matters that were involved? How many, in 1917, were prepared to comprehend
              the idea of Mittel-Europa, or Germany's relation to the Balkans, or the effect of
              these upon the vital interests of America? How many voters, whose only knowledge of
              German character and purpose was gained from pleasant and profitable friendship with
              worthy American citizens of Teutonic blood, would have believed that German policy
              coldly contemplated such damnable projects of world dominion with such arbitrary,
              despotic power?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, how many citizens were in a position to appreciate intelligently the
              fundamental significance to America in particular and to democracy in general, of the
              destruction of international law and of international good faith, and of the
              substitution of the arbitrary power of the conqueror for the cooperative efforts of
              liberal nations, in arranging the world's affairs? How would this affect the Monroe
              Doctrine? What effect would it have upon the safety of the Philippines? What would
              become of the principle of the Open Door in the Orient? What would be the effect on
              the growing tendency toward arbitration, to which we have always been devoted? Every
              one of these questions was vital to the issue of war or peace, and yet in the early
              part of 1917, how many citizens were ready to reach an intelligent conclusion?</p>
            <p>This does not mean that public opinion can not and must not prevail. One thing this
              war has emphasized throughout the world is that in modern military conflict, the
              morale of the people is as essential to victory as the fighting spirit of the troops.
              It simply means that to such a complex question the remedy is not to be found by a
              mere counting of the hands. Great vital problems, upon which depend the destiny of
              civilization, can not be so easily and simply <pb id="VAC1001-121" n="109"/>solved.
              The government must study these many problems, must grapple with all their constituent
              elements, and must determine what policy under all the circumstances of the case will
              best fulfill the purpose, the ideals and the aspirations of our people. Upon the
              ability of the people's chosen leaders faithfully to perform this task, depends the
              destiny of the nation. Had Congress and the president lacked the courage to face this
              problem, had they escaped their responsibility by submitting it to a referendum vote,
              the evidence would plainly indicate that America would have come too late to save the
              world from the curse of German victory.</p>
            <p>Nor is this written in any spirit of disparagement of my fellow citizens. It is no
              slander on American patriotism that they would vote for peace until the case for war
              had been clearly made. Nor does it cast any reflection upon my native land to say that
              the great body of our electorate were not specialists in the problems of world
              politics, European diplomacy and military strategy that were involved. On the other
              hand, the wonderful spirit of sacrifice, the resistless enthusiasm, the militant
              patriotism, and the stern determination and resolution, with which the nation rallied
              to the defense of the policy adopted by its chosen leaders, is the highest evidence
              one could seek of our loyalty, our character and our common sense.</p>
            <p>The futility of majority votes is capable of indefinite illustration, and yet,
              because it is democratic in form, it is too willingly accepted as a substitute for
              hard study, statesmanlike methods and official responsibility. Before the thirteenth
              amendment, slavery was a state matter, and yet it could hardly be argued that because
              the people of the southern states would have voted in favor of slavery, that a
              satisfactory solution would have been attained. In 1893, the people of Switzerland
              voted in favor of abolishing kosher beef, an act of religious intoleration and
              bigotry, and <pb id="VAC1001-122" n="110"/>no one would argue that the problem of
              religious liberty had been satisfactorily adjusted. A few years since the municipal
              council of an American city enacted an ordinance that virtually deprived citizens of a
              certain race of their rights of liberty and property. At the time the ordinance met
              with a great wave of popular approval, but no one would to-day say that it solved any
              problems of liberty or racial conflicts.</p>
            <p>The truth is that popular votes on specific measures may be very valuable in some
              cases and equally mischievous in others. If the measure is simple in its elements, one
              upon which an intelligent public opinion is therefore possible, and if it is one that
              will be difficult to enforce, unless backed by an aggressive public opinion, a
              referendum vote is both efficacious and desirable. Prohibition is probably such a
              measure. But when the problem is complicated, outside the range of the information and
              experience of the average voter, and one requiring special knowledge or technical
              investigation&mdash;and many of our modern problems are of this character&mdash;the
              counting of hands can not afford a rational or scientific solution. This is not saying
              that the people should not rule. It merely argues that when they rule they should rule
              intelligently. If they have technical problems to be solved, let them employ technical
              experts for their solution, instead of trying to become experts for themselves.</p>
            <p>This seems simple and obvious and yet it is difficult to work out in practise. To the
              person who approaches government from the view-point of the needs and problems to be
              solved, there will be no danger. Seeing the needs first, he will naturally seek the
              instrument best suited to the case at hand. Such a one will not demand a referendum on
              technical matters because it does not meet the needs of technical solution. But the
              average citizen does not have this view-<pb id="VAC1001-123" n="111"/>point or
              approach. When he is told to support the use of the referendum on a given issue,
              because it is democratic, his support is bound to come, regardless of the nature of
              the problem. When the demagogue, declaring that the voice of the people is the voice
              of God, seeks to "pass the buck" of official responsibility by the referendum vote, he
              is regarded as a champion of democracy, yet in fact, he may have been a cowardly
              shirker.</p>
            <p>The third and final advantage to be urged for the functional approach, is that it
              makes clear the dramatic and absorbingly human side of government. There is nothing in
              the study of the organization of the state administration that affords the basis of an
              appeal to the generous instincts of human nature, until the administration is seen in
              its functioning aspects, of safeguarding the public health, making war against the
              white man's plague, and the innumerable other functions discharged by the executive
              department. It is the functional side of government that has its story of heart
              interest for every normal person.</p>
            <p>Take for example the position of state fire marshal. If one's study of that
              department is based mainly on the statutory provisions creating it, the detailed
              duties placed upon its several members, and the rules and regulations for its
              procedure, it is difficult to conceive of anything that would be more deadly or
              monotonous to the student, or more barren of results. But approach it from the other
              angle&mdash;the needs and conditions that led to its adoption&mdash;and one gets a
              vastly different result. The report of the fire marshal for Indiana for one year, for
              instance, shows that the citizens of Indiana, in that year, lost over six million
              dollars' worth of property and one hundred and twelve lives. Some of the tragic
              stories of the useless loss of life, and the wiping out, in a moment, of the savings
              of a lifetime, present rare <pb id="VAC1001-124" n="112"/>opportunities to secure the
              closest attention of the child, and to fix forever in his consciousness the grave
              public importance of this neglected office.</p>
            <p>I sat in a teachers' institute, only a year ago, and heard the fire marshal of
              Indiana tell the teachers of the work of his department and make a resistless plea for
              their cooperation. He spoke for a full hour, and every teacher listened with eager
              attention, as he explained the common causes of fires, how the department was seeking
              to prevent them, and how they might aid in the campaign of education. The reason for
              their attention was not to be found in the eloquence of the speaker, nor in any
              special effort on his part to entertain his audience. The secret of his success lay in
              the fact that he made it clear, as he went along, that the work in which he was
              engaged and in which he sought their aid, was the work of saving human beings from a
              horrible death by fire, and of safeguarding homes against a real and ever-present
              peril.</p>
            <p>There is not a department in our government so insignificant, so far removed from the
              field of popular interest, or so immersed in technical details, but what, if
              approached from the point of view of the functions it performs, can produce its
              stories of absorbing interest. In the chapters that are to follow, this point will be
              illustrated time and time again, in order that no one can miss the human significance
              of government.</p>
            <p>In the remainder of the chapter I desire to illustrate very briefly how this idea may
              be carried out in connection with the different topics covered in an ordinary course
              in civics.</p>
            <p>In the first place let us begin the study of organized society with its smallest
              unit, the one with which every child is familiar, and where we can begin dealing with
              the subjects and concepts of society in terms of the child's personal experience. We
              will, therefore, begin with the family. <pb id="VAC1001-125" n="113"/>Here we must
              begin with the question, "Why?" Why do we have a family? What is its purpose and
              function? What need was there that brought the family into existence? Let us not make
              the mistake of giving dogmatic answers to the problems, and destroying the fruits of
              our method. Rather by artful suggestion and leading question, let us direct the
              inquiring mind of the child along profitable channels of investigation. In all
              civilized and uncivilized countries we have the family. There must be some need,
              common to mankind, that the family has to solve. Set that question as the initial
              problem. Let the pupil realize that in the most commonplace things about him are deep
              and interesting puzzles to challenge his instinct of curiosity.</p>
            <p>Nor should we pass on until the class has found the answer to the problem, until they
              have found that the family is not a mere accidental creation, or a mere matter of
              convenience, but a vital social necessity, involving the most fundamental personal and
              social obligations. Let them realize in their early years that upon the integrity of
              the family, and the proper performance of its functions, rest the destiny and
              happiness of society. They can realize the necessity of the family as a means to
              protect and train the young and as a source of comfort, happiness and inspiration for
              its members. From the realization of these vital truths, and from them alone, can
              spring that respect and devotion to the family which lies at the very basis of our
              society.</p>
            <p>Having discovered that the family is a cooperative arrangement, to perform certain
              very vital and important functions, it is natural to inquire as to the methods and
              machinery adopted to this end. In the first place there must be certain rules or
              regulations, without which everything would be confusion. Why do we have a fixed hour
              for dinner? Why not let everybody eat dinner whenever he <pb id="VAC1001-126" n="114"
              />felt so disposed? Why apportion out the work to the different members of the family?
              Why not allow each member to perform just such tasks as each might choose? These and
              similar questions will drive home to youthful consciousness, in terms of their own
              experience, the inherent necessity of rules and regulations to any cooperative effort.
              Nor is there much danger that this can be overdone, if done in a skilful and tactful
              manner. It will impress on youthful consciousness something that many people have
              failed to acquire in a lifetime, a real understanding of the nature and necessity of
              law.</p>
            <p>But who makes these rules? Who decides how these things shall be done? Why not allow
              each child to make his own rules and provide his own plans? Thus is introduced the
              idea of authority which is vested in the parents, and which must be vested in some
              definite body in every cooperative effort. Thus, in the family, we are able to develop
              very clearly and in terms of the pupil's experience, the conceptions of law, authority
              and organization, which lie at the very basis of government and society.</p>
            <p>When the possibilities of the family have been exhausted, the time has come to
              develop the idea that the family can not live unto itself alone. There are many things
              that we must have that the family can not provide. The children must have
              kindergartens and schools and yet every family can not have its own educational
              system. There must be roads by which children can get to school, and people may go to
              market, and yet everybody can not build his own highways. Unfortunate people become
              sick or old and can not work, and yet other people can not take them into their homes,
              or permit them to die for want of shelter or of food. Occasionally parents die,
              leaving little children that must be educated, fed and clothed, and yet there is no
              one to care for them.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-127" n="115"/>
            <p>These are some of the problems that the families of a given district have tried to
              solve by joining in some form of local government, such as townships and counties. The
              local governments have laid out highways in order to enable the people of a community
              to pass to and fro when it was necessary and convenient. They have developed machinery
              for the care and upkeep of these highways. They have established school districts and
              school boards, built school-houses, employed teachers, and made it possible for all
              children, rich and poor, to get an education. This has required the expenditure of
              great sums of money and the development of school regulations and rules. This means
              that some one must be given the power to get the money from the people, by levying
              taxes and collecting them. This requires additional machinery, and men to provide for
              these elaborate and necessary functions.</p>
            <p>Then there are poor-farms and orphans' homes that must be built and managed unless we
              are going to leave their helpless inmates to a cruel and brutal fate. In addition to
              all these things, there are jails to be erected, courts to be established, criminals
              to be arrested, fraud, theft and burglary to be prevented, epidemics of disease to be
              fought and countless other things that must necessarily be performed in any civilized
              community. It requires little imagination to see that these matters touch questions of
              human happiness at a myriad different points. It becomes equally obvious that local
              government is a means to an end, a mere cooperative device by which the people of a
              community jointly solve their common problems. It follows, with equal clearness, that
              the laws that they develop, like the customs and rules of the home, are but the
              essential conditions to effective and harmonious effort.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have been considering rural government only. When people gather together
              into compact and <pb id="VAC1001-128" n="116"/>crowded communities that we call
              villages and cities, there are still additional problems that the conditions of city
              life present, which require a solution. Streets must be paved, lighted and cleaned,
              garbage must be disposed of, fire protection must be assured, building regulations
              must be adopted that will protect the interests of health and safety, and parks,
              playgrounds and similar conveniences must be established. Tenement-house regulations
              must be developed, an efficient system of transportation established, and an adequate
              and wholesome water supply must be afforded. In addition to these institutional needs,
              there are demands for many kinds of regulations that would be unnecessary in rural
              communities.</p>
            <p>The danger of fire in congested districts requires elaborate building codes, to
              insure the erection of buildings that will not increase the risk. The crowded
              condition of the city streets requires traffic regulations to safeguard life and limb
              and to prevent the traffic from becoming hopelessly confused. In rural communities,
              the question of sewerage and garbage disposal is one that may be safely left to the
              individual family, but in urban communities, where epidemics of diseases are more
              common, and where people live so close together that the collection of sewerage in one
              home jeopardizes the health of all the homes in the vicinity, these things must be
              arranged by law. People must accept these limitations upon individual discretion as a
              necessary means of preserving health.</p>
            <p>Then there comes the fundamental and intricate problem of city planning. If the
              people are to have an efficient city in which to live, it ought to be built and
              developed in accordance with a careful plan, by which the most wholesome places for
              homes may be so utilized, and the manufacturing, distributing and terminal facilities
              so grouped that the maximum of efficiency will be attained. People can not be <pb
                id="VAC1001-129" n="117"/>allowed to build just where they will, but ought to
              conform to a general program that will make the city more beautiful, more wholesome
              and more efficient. And so we might go on indefinitely, pointing out the peculiar
              problems that arise where people are living under the urban conditions of modern
              life.</p>
            <p>It was to meet these conditions that city governments have been developed. It was to
              solve these complex problems that there has been developed the vast bulk of municipal
              ordinances and other laws, dealing with the special problems of city life. Municipal
              government and functions, like all other laws and institutions, is thus a product of
              evolution and development, as men have struggled with the conditions that confronted
              them in the modern city. In this way the study of municipalities should be approached
              and developed. Beginning with the needs, that can be made very obvious, proceed to the
              instrumentalities for their solution. Proceed from the cause to the effect and you
              develop an interesting, a pedagogical, as well as a more intelligent approach.</p>
            <p>The development of city government in America has not been an inspiring spectacle.
              Until recent years it has not received either skilful or scientific handling. Many
              changes were made, and the framework can be traced through many periods of adventure,
              but little real progress was achieved until the last two decades. And the reason was
              to be found chiefly in the method of approach. They did not begin with a careful and
              accurate analysis of the inherent problems of urban life, as a basis for the creation
              of municipal institutions carefully designed to solve these very problems. In most
              cases the methods employed appear to have been much simpler in form. The people knew
              that there were great city problems without adequate machinery for their solution.
              They supposed the form of government was <pb id="VAC1001-130" n="118"/>inadequate, and
              they began to pattern it more or less like the federal government, or perhaps the
              particular state government that they admired. Then they began to try out certain
              governmental theories, based upon their general plausibility or inherent
              reasonableness, rather than upon their particular appropriateness to the task at hand.
              The result was an admitted failure of city government in America.</p>
            <p>With the development of the commission form of city government, there began a new
              interest in the problem, and a real scientific effort to analyze the conditions and to
              devise a system of government that would meet existing problems. Out of this has
              evolved the different plans of the business manager form, and there is now reason to
              believe that real progress is being made. That progress will be conditioned, however,
              upon the degree of popular intelligence in regard to civic problems. For another
              wholesome result of the present scientific spirit is the recognition that structural
              reforms alone can not suffice. The most skilfully devised government that can be
              arranged is, after all, only the instrument or machinery through which the people of
              the community can function. The only enduring foundation, therefore, upon which our
              municipal democracy can rest, is the character, patriotism and intelligence of the
              people.</p>
            <p>Thus we find that city organization, like the family and the rural government, came
              into existence in answer to pressing human needs. It represents necessary steps in the
              development of the great cooperative process that we call society. The institutions
              created are entrusted with the solving of existing problems whose accurate solution is
              indispensable to human happiness. The laws that we find on every hand, like the rules
              of the family in the home, are the indispensable means by which our joint efforts may
              become effective. Based upon these human needs, government <pb id="VAC1001-131"
                n="119"/>is necessarily a human institution, and its success or failure even in
              apparently insignificant details, is a story written in terms of tragedy and pathos,
              that should find a rich emotional response in every normal child.</p>
            <p>We come now to the state government where the same method of approach and the same
              general principles should be employed. In spite of all the varied functions performed
              by the family, and by local rural and urban government, there are still many things to
              be accomplished, many ends to be sought, and many ideals to be realized, where these
              institutions could not avail. We have noticed that the question of highways is a very
              important one to all forms of local government, and yet, it is a question of such
              general importance, that it can not be left to them alone. One county might decide
              that its main highway should run east and west, an adjoining county might build its
              trunk line north and south, while yet another might come to still a different
              conclusion. Under such circumstances, an effective highway system from one county to
              another, throughout the state, would be impossible. And yet this is a very obvious
              need, which can be adequately met only by organizing a political unit, comprising many
              counties, which we call a state. One of the important functions of every state
              government to-day is the development of an adequate system of state highways.</p>
            <p>The necessity of laws governing the ownership of land, regulating sales of personal
              property, and providing for valid contracts, in order to enable people to carry on the
              ordinary duties and necessities of life, existed among the more primitive peoples, and
              is an obvious necessity to-day. The making, interpreting and enforcing of these laws,
              is another function that the state is organized to perform. It might be argued that
              such was not necessary, for the local governments might attend to that, but a moment's
              reflection shows how impossible is such a scheme. Suppose <pb id="VAC1001-132" n="120"
              />this was done, and there were as many laws governing the validity of a contract as
              there were counties in the state, conditions would be intolerable. A man's contracts,
              valid in one county, might be void in another. Under such circumstances there could be
              no general trade or commercial relations, for they depend upon certainty and
              uniformity in their legal foundations, and this could come only from the state.</p>
            <p>The regulation of railroads in the interest of the public safety, better service, and
              reasonable rates&mdash;a very necessary function in modern times&mdash;is another
              condition necessitating the existence of the state. For if this were left to counties,
              there would be hopeless complexity. Suppose, for example, that one county required
              that passenger coaches be heated with steam, another county demanded that they be
              heated with hot water, and still another that they use the vapor system. Any one of
              these regulations would, in itself, be reasonable, but to have to comply with all
              three, on a trip through adjoining counties, would be an intolerable hardship that
              would virtually prevent efficient service and do nobody any good.</p>
            <p>The question of public health is one of the needs that made local government
              necessary, and yet it is a problem that also demands the attention of the state. One
              county may become careless in matters of public health. Epidemics may break out, which
              through the carelessness of local officials, may spread to adjoining counties. With
              our modern means of communication, contagious diseases may spread with great rapidity
              and ease from one community to another. Thus, every community has a very definite
              interest, not only in its own health, but also an interest in the health and welfare
              of others. Consequently the state is resorted to for the purpose of supplementing the
              work of local health <pb id="VAC1001-133" n="121"/>authorities, and initiating
              measures of its own for the protection of all.</p>
            <p>The relation of these functions to the health and happiness of the people is very
              vital. The number of lives saved by the state health departments in the recent
              epidemics of influenza would doubtless run into the tens of thousands. Likewise, the
              lives that might have been spared, had the departments of all the states been up to
              the maximum of efficiency, would doubtless run into the thousands.</p>
            <p>Again, the question of education is generally regarded as a local matter, to be
              attended to by local government. It is true that much of the work of building and
              maintaining the public school system devolves upon the local communities, but there
              are important matters of education, which we have found it expedient to leave to the
              state department. The reasons for this are not hard to seek. The question of the
              education of youth of the land is not confined to local groups. It is as broad as the
              foundations of our democracy. Every citizen of the state, regardless of his place of
              residence, has a vital interest in the efficiency of schools in every corner of the
              state. To permit ignorance to develop in any section, or to allow the people of any
              portion to rear children who are not prepared for civic duty, would be to undermine
              the foundations of democracy and imperil our future.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in those sections where the popular intelligence is the lowest, and where
              education is needed the most, the educational system, under a system of absolute local
              control, would there be the poorest. It has been found necessary, therefore, to create
              state departments of education, to give them certain administrative control over local
              educational matters, in order that the people of the state may be assured of a system
              of education, of a certain standard of <pb id="VAC1001-134" n="122"/>efficiency
              throughout the state, regardless of local feeling and interests.</p>
            <p>In other words, no community can be a law unto itself. There are vital, valid reasons
              why the units of government are created as large and comprehensive as they are. There
              is a real human reason for every department, every bureau, every division and every
              office in the government of your state, and if there is not, that office or bureau
              ought to be abolished. The introduction to state government should be another
              repetition, by fresh illustration, of the fundamental principles that government is a
              means to an end, that the test of its efficiency is its capacity to serve the best
              interests of humanity, that its laws and institutions are but the necessary
              instruments through which the people work out their destiny, that every function
              performed has a deep human significance, and that it is only through the cooperative
              process, made possible through law and order, that progress is achieved.</p>
            <p>This brings us to the consideration of the federal government, where the same method
              should be repeated. After the Declaration of Independence, the thirteen colonies found
              themselves thirteen independent, sovereign nations. During the continuance of war, the
              pressure of a common foe held them together in a partly efficient state of cooperative
              endeavor, under the common counsel and guidance of the Continental Congress. But when
              the war was won, and this pressure was removed, the differences between the colonies
              received new emphasis. They tried in every possible way to gain the ends that each
              colony desired, without committing themselves to any effective, cooperative endeavor,
              but conditions grew worse instead of better.</p>
            <p>They became involved in boundary disputes that threatened serious controversies.
              While there was a provision in the Articles of Confederation for the settlement <pb
                id="VAC1001-135" n="123"/>of such disputes, there was no effective way of enforcing
              it. New York, New Hampshire and Massachusetts almost came to blows over territory that
              is now Vermont. There was actual warfare between the citizens of Connecticut and
              Pennsylvania over disputed rights to Wyoming Valley. Similar disputes between other
              colonies threatened the peace and prosperity of the country.</p>
            <p>Then there were commercial rivalries, resulting in trade discriminations and
              retaliatory legislation. For example, New York proceeded on the theory that she could
              prosper only by tearing down the trade and well-being of her competitors. She
              discriminated against Connecticut and New Jersey, until war seemed probable, and it
              required the resourcefulness and influence of Washington to preserve peace. Hostility
              was carried to such a point that it resulted in a boycott and embargo being resorted
              to by Connecticut against New York, while general freedom of trade and commerce, that
              would have been profitable to all, was very substantially impaired. In describing the
              disordered state produced by these conditions John Fiske declared: "The different
              states with their different tariff and tonnage acts, began to make commercial war upon
              one another. No sooner had the other three New England States virtually closed their
              ports to British shipping, than Connecticut threw hers wide open, an act which she
              followed up by laying duties upon imports from Massachusetts. Pennsylvania
              discriminated against Delaware, and New Jersey, pillaged at once by both her greater
              neighbors, was compared to a cask tapped at both ends. The conduct of New York became
              especially selfish and blameworthy. . . . Of all the thirteen states, none behaved
              worse except Rhode Island."</p>
            <p>More important still, perhaps, was the inability of the thirteen colonies to make
              adequate provision for protection <pb id="VAC1001-136" n="124"/>against foreign foes.
              If the Continental Congress entered into an agreement with foreign countries, and a
              particular colony felt that it might profit by refusing to be so bound, it disregarded
              the treaty stipulation and the Continental Congress was powerless to prevent. Thus our
              foreign relations could not be satisfactorily adjusted, which only increased the
              danger from foreign enemies. Moreover, the capacity of the colonies to wage effective
              warfare depended, in a large measure, upon their being able to finance their projects,
              pay their debts, and build up a national credit. But there was no effective means by
              which this could be accomplished. The Continental Congress would impose certain quotas
              on the colonies, but it had no way of enforcing payment. Each colony, fearful lest it
              pay more than its fair share and dissatisfied with the method of apportionment, vied
              with every other colony in seeking to give a relatively smaller share of the sum
              demanded. The inevitable followed. From 1781 to 1786, Congress laid requisitions to
              the amount of ten million dollars, but received from the colonies less than one-fourth
              of that amount. During the fourteen months immediately preceding the formation of the
              Federal Constitution, there was not enough paid into the general treasury to pay even
              the interest on the national debt. Under such conditions the colonies faced bankruptcy
              and an absolute loss of credit, both at home and abroad. In the face of such
              conditions they could scarcely hope to contend successfully with any foe that might
              assail them.</p>
            <p>These and many other facts, the enumeration of which is prohibited by the limit of
              space, made the formation of the federal government absolutely imperative. The
              colonies, as already observed in a previous chapter, did not unite in the federal
              government because they had lost any of their devotion to their individual states, nor
              because <pb id="VAC1001-137" n="125"/>friction, jealousy and hatred between them had
              disappeared, nor because they were moved by any spirit of universal love. They joined
              in the federal government because bitter experience had taught them that they must.
              Like every successful institution of government that exists, it was framed to meet
              certain specific needs that could not be adequately met without it. The colonists
              built it, not out of love for the idea of a national government, but because they had
              come to believe that it was only through such an instrumentality that the freedom,
              security and liberty of the states could be made permanently secure.</p>
            <p>History has amply vindicated the soundness of their judgment. The functions of the
              federal government have gradually increased. They are so obviously important and make
              such clear appeals to the emotional life, that that phase of the problem does not need
              additional illustration here.</p>
            <p>Finally, we come to the question of foreign policy, world politics and international
              affairs. The new eminence that America occupies in world affairs, can not and must not
              be ignored. No course in citizenship that did not introduce this subject can be
              complete. Here, again, we should use the same approach. Just as neither the home, the
              city, nor the state can exist independently, because of the nature, extent and
              character of their needs, so nations can not dwell in absolute and "splendid
              isolation," however much they might so desire. The life of our present civilization is
              too complex to permit it. We need things produced in all the sections of the earth's
              surface, and, to a more or less extent, other nations need the products of our soil
              and effort. This means international commerce and dealings, international agreements,
              treaties and understandings, and international friction, conflicts and
              difficulties.</p>
            <p>To meet these needs, the statesmen of the world have been <pb id="VAC1001-138"
                n="126"/>struggling for centuries to evolve a system of law as an effective basis
              for the growing needs of our international life. The body of international law that we
              now have, is the result. In addition to some of the fundamental needs thus provided
              for, the nations found it would be highly useful to arrange for international postal
              service and telegraph service. The different customs provisions of the different
              countries, the lack of a uniform system of weights and measures, the need of a
              world-wide struggle against certain types of disease, and many other matters, have
              been forcing the nations farther and farther along the line of international
              organization and administration. As a consequence we have to-day such accomplished
              results in the field of international organization as the Universal Postal Union,
              Universal Telegraph Union, Universal Wireless Telegraph Union, an International Union
              for the Publication of Customs Tariffs, International Bureau of Health, and many
              others.</p>
            <p>Another method of meeting the national needs of an international character, has been
              the development of foreign policies on the part of the individual nations. Such
              policies are promulgated as a basis of conduct for the nation involved, in the belief
              that it will be a valuable instrument in the protection of national interests. The
              Monroe Doctrine is such a policy and should be approached and studied from this angle.
              It is a means to an end. It is the promulgation of a principle of conduct for America,
              which we believe will best preserve our national interests.</p>
            <p>The greatest problem between nations, however, is the problem of war and peace. To
              meet this problem has been the age-long dream of statesmen and philosophers. The
              development of international law, the growth and rapidity of international conferences
              over world affairs, the increasing tendency to submit important claims to arbitration,
              the Hague Conferences&mdash;all are methods contributing to this <pb id="VAC1001-139"
                n="127"/>solution. The proposed league of nations, now being considered by the great
              nations of the world, is the next step that is proposed. Like all other political
              developments, this proposal has come in answer to an obvious need, in this case, an
              appalling need. It is only in approaching it from this angle that we can hope to reach
              an intelligent conclusion. Will it be an effective instrument to safeguard the peace
              and justice of the world, without the resort to the devastating crime of war?</p>
            <p>Thus, we find our foreign relations, as well as all other departments of our
              political life, bear witness to the basic idea and point of view that is essential to
              civic intelligence. Much of the popular misinformation regarding the league of nations
              would never have developed were we accustomed to approach problems of politics from
              the standpoint of fundamental needs. Again, in the development of international law,
              we find the same idea exemplified that we found in the rules and regulations of the
              home, that in the last analysis, law is a basis of cooperative effort, and for that
              reason an absolute necessity to any kind of modern society.</p>
            <p>If the nature of the law, and its importance as the basis of our political and social
              life, seems to have been too much emphasized, let the reader pause and meditate. As I
              write this chapter, I am informed that a great body of organized men have determined
              to set aside a lawful agreement between them and their country, to stop some of the
              fundamental instruments of production and distribution, to bring on a state of
              starvation and famine, in wanton violation of the law, because they do not want
              Congress to approve a certain section of a pending bill. The offending measure may be
              unwise or unjust. It may, perhaps, be open to fair and intelligent criticism. But when
              the organized laboring men of America base their appeal to Congress upon threats <pb
                id="VAC1001-140" n="128"/>of illegal force and brutal intimidation, the time has
              come for those who believe in law and justice as against the forces of arbitrary
              power, to assert themselves.</p>
            <p>This, together with the prevalence of mob law, the recent outbreaks of race riots,
              and the growth of a radical, lawless class, may well cause us to pause and wonder.
              These individual outbreaks may bring on others or may be used to illustrate the
              fundamental need of a return to first principles, to demonstrate the inherent need of
              law, and that law alone can afford a safe basis of progress or achievement. If this
              can be made a part of the conscious life and thought of the children of America, if
              they can learn this great fundamental truth as a basis of their life philosophy, if
              they can approach the problem of the future from this point of view, the freedom and
              destiny of our nation may be safely entrusted into their keeping.</p>

            <head rend="center sc">THE STORY OF THE COMMUNITY</head>
            <p><hi rend="b">A</hi> NUMBER of years ago, in a small city of some four thousand
              inhabitants, there occurred a dramatic political conflict that shook the community to
              its very center. The city had been made dry under a local option law. The city
              officials, however, had consistently refused to enforce the law. The saloons were
              operating without a license. Gambling was carried on notoriously and without
              restraint. Immorality and lawlessness flourished, until the citizens of the community
              became aroused. They demanded the enforcement of the law, but without effect. Public
              opinion seemed impotent.</p>
            <p>To meet this situation, a group of citizens organized and prepared to fight the evil.
              It seemed that victory must be assured, for the clear majority of the community were
              unhesitatingly arrayed upon the side of public decency. They put forward their chosen
              candidates for the offices of mayor and marshal. These candidates confidently entered
              the primary of the dominant party. They were pledged to a program of law enforcement,
              and on that platform sought to defeat the renomination of the sitting officers.</p>
            <p>The party primary election was in the form of a mass convention, open to all the
              party members of the city. It was held in a room scarcely large enough to contain all
              the voters of the party. The members turned out <hi rend="i">en masse</hi>. It seemed
              clear that the forces of righteousness would prevail. But unexpected complications
              arose. The enemy, seeing themselves outnumbered, fought for delay. They <pb
                id="VAC1001-144" n="132"/>resorted to all manner of obstructive tactics. They caused
              needless confusion and disorder. Their henchmen, well supplied with cheap cigars,
              filled the atmosphere with obnoxious smoke, until even the most hardened and
              experienced suffered some inconvenience. Hoodlums, half drunk, were turned loose to
              "rough-house" the assembly, much to the consternation and discomfiture of the elder
              and more dignified of the group.</p>
            <p>As these tactics were continued, and as the night wore on, the more timid and less
              aggressive gave up the fight, and turned toward home. Moreover, only those quit who
              were on the side of decency. This continued until their enemies were left with a
              majority, when obstructions seemed to cease, nominations were made, and the forces of
              evil prevailed. It was the old, old story of the strongly organized minority, out
              fighting the loosely organized and indifferent majority. The friends of criminality
              fought with fidelity and determination. They never hesitated until the fight was won.
              Their opponents lacked the sustained interest, the fixed determination and the
              effective team work that could give them victory.</p>
            <p>Nor is this an isolated or unusual incident. It is typical of what is continually
              taking place throughout our land. The power of the determined, organized minority to
              rule is an established axiom in our political life. Nor does it mean the loss of
              popular government, as superficial critics would have us think. In the party
              convention just described there was no breakdown in popular control. Every man had an
              equal voice, and the opportunity to make that voice effective. But many did not place
              a high value on that opportunity. They voluntarily chose the ease and comfort of home,
              to the political struggle for the supremacy of their ideals. They deliberately and
              knowingly left the nomination of candidates for public office to the discretion and
                <pb id="VAC1001-145" n="133"/>judgment of those they left behind. They, in fact, by
              voluntarily absenting themselves, delegated their choice of candidates to those who
              had remained.</p>
            <p>In spite of these conditions, the local papers and the good citizens of the town
              decried the absence of popular government. They declared the bosses and machines had
              robbed them of their victory. Democracy no longer existed, and in its place had been
              erected an invisible government that ruled with despotic power. Thus the good people
              of the community sought the comfort of a spiritual or moral alibi. They criticized
              everything and everybody but themselves, and yet they, themselves, were the only ones
              to blame. They accepted the orthodox accounts of invisible government, with its
              grasping tyranny, as a vicarious atonement for their own evils of indifference and
              neglect. When the local press declared its abiding confidence in the integrity,
              courage and idealism of the community, and laid all the blame upon the wicked
              machinations of the political machine, the people responded with unanimous approval.
              Here was the voice of a prophet for which they long had yearned. Here was a message
              that met their every need. It salved their conscience, it flattered their
              intelligence, and it "passed the buck." It released them from any possible share of
              personal responsibility, and provided a cleansing bath of spiritual and moral
              immunity.</p>
            <p>Therein lies one of the great tragedies of democracy. Instead of facing his mistakes
              and taking responsibility for the consequences of his error, the citizen seeks escape
              through the sophistries of the demagogue. In the city I have described, there was no
              invisible government with resistless power. There was no lack of democracy. There was
              no machine to coerce the popular will. All such talk was sheer, unadulterated
              political "bunk." There were present all the instrumentalities of popular government.
                <pb id="VAC1001-146" n="134"/>The people could have nominated whom they pleased had
              they had sufficient interest to fight it to the finish. Had they been willing to
              sacrifice a few hours of personal inconvenience, the victory would have been their
              own. Nothing could have won for the wicked, save the indifference of the virtuous.
              Nobody could be nominated, save by the votes or the acquiescence of the majority. True
              it is; the unfair tactics of the opposition made the victory a little more difficult
              to attain. But it was always possible. It was always within their grasp. It was only
              by their voluntary withdrawal that the enemy could win.</p>
            <p>Viewed from any angle, analyzed in any light, there is no escape from these
              conclusions. Yet had there been one in that little city, with the courage to tell the
              truth, and to say that the victory of the wicked was a voluntary gift from the
              righteous, there would have arisen a chorus of outraged indignation. And yet such were
              the plain unvarnished facts.</p>
            <p>A study of the community which is to contribute to the solution of its problems, and
              the civic efficiency of its members, can not ignore this fundamental situation. Out of
              such a study, there should come a vivid consciousness of the vital facts of political
              life; instead of the complacent acceptance of the flattery of demagogues, there should
              develop a keen, dynamic interest in the welfare of the community, with an accompanying
              conviction of personal accountability. Unless these things follow, education becomes
              pedantic, impotent and unreal.</p>
            <p>How may these things be accomplished? Certainly much can be done by bringing to bear
              upon the study of one's neighborhood, the evolutionary point of view and the habit of
              critical analysis. From these there will inevitably result an increasing interest in
              the community itself, as the unraveling of its story discloses the romance and human
              interest locked up in its history. Thus the story of the <pb id="VAC1001-147" n="135"
              />community will be a constant challenge to the student's instinct of curiosity. As
              the satisfying of this instinct takes the student deeper and deeper into the intimate
              details of his surroundings, there is laid the basis for a growing interest in
              community welfare and an affectionate attachment to its destinies. As these forces
              gather strength, the student is being splendidly equipped for the political battles of
              the future. For in the last analysis, the reason the determined organized minorities
              so frequently win, is that they are more interested in the triumph of their cause than
              are their opponents in the welfare of their city. The members of the determined
              minority very frequently have a bread-and-butter interest. Their jobs or their
              investments may be at stake. On the other hand, the great bulk of the people have no
              interest more vital than their general desire that the good shall ultimately prevail.
              If we want them to take a more dynamic interest, we must develop in them a more vital
              attachment to their community and its welfare.</p>
            <p>Much has been written, from time to time, concerning the proverbial incompetence of
              city government in America, as compared with the city governments of other lands. In
              this connection, it has occasionally been pointed out, with great significance, that
              the people of the average city in America take much less pride and interest in their
              city and its affairs than do the residents of foreign cities. Undoubtedly there is a
              vital connection between the two. It is not difficult to see, that, with an increased
              interest and pride in one's city, there would go an increased willingness to fight and
              labor in its behalf.</p>
            <p>But how do we account for the difference in local interest? Perhaps the most
              persuasive explanation is to be found in the migratory nature of our population. In
              many European cities we are told that the same families will live in the same cities,
              in the same neighborhood, and even in the same <pb id="VAC1001-148" n="136"/>house,
              for generations. Under such circumstances there develops a wealth of romance and
              tradition, handed down from father to son, permeating every detail of their
              environment. The very familiarity of the scenes, the intimate knowledge of its
              details, and the deep personal significance that would attach to the otherwise
              commonplace elements in the situation, would result in a deep and affectionate regard
              for the community, such as one experiences for the scenes of his early home and
              childhood.</p>
            <p>In America, however, where our population is in a continual migratory state, such a
              romantic and human interest in the community, where one happens for the moment to
              reside, is almost impossible. We have many cities where the percentage of native born
              is infinitesimal, and some states where their native sons form but a minor portion of
              their population. Moreover, where people do live in cities for any time, the tendency
              to move about from place to place is so well established that moving day, in our
              larger cities, has become an established institution. Add to this the great hordes of
              foreigners that annually seek our shores, and we have a situation that is as
              perplexing as it is dangerous.</p>
            <p>It seems fairly obvious, that, under such circumstances, the development of a pride
              and interest in local affairs will not be automatic. If we are to have men and women
              deeply interested in community life, that interest must be the result of early
              training and education. By formal instruction and study we must seek to overcome, in
              developing an affectionate attachment for the locality, the unfortunate handicap
              imposed by the shifting character of our population. At the same time the student will
              be learning that, in the history of his neighborhood, there are stories of absorbing
              interest, and in the fighting of its battles, there is <pb id="VAC1001-149" n="137"
              />the zest and exaltation that come to those who struggle in a worthy cause.</p>
            <p>Another by-product of community study is that it opens up new lines of interest,
              stretching far back into our nation's history, and in extent, throughout the nation
              and the world. The history of every neighborhood is so inseparably interwoven with the
              history of the nation and humanity, that these new lines of contact are varied and
              inevitable. As a result, when the maturing child, in other subjects or advanced
              studies, again crosses these old familiar lines of interest, he experiences that glow
              of satisfaction and joy that comes to all of us in the crossing of familiar paths. He
              begins to realize the intimate relations between all phases of human effort. He is
              laying the basis for a source of joy that may endure through life, as he has the
              opportunity to indulge his historical interest.</p>
            <p>The possibilities of education in establishing these familiar paths, were brought
              home to me very vividly one day, several years ago. I was taking an all-day trip
              through a neighboring state with a friend of my college days. It was dry, hot and
              dusty. I was bored by the scenery as I saw only trees, dirt and dusty vegetation. By
              skilfully taking advantage of a technical loop-hole, inadvertently left by the faculty
              of my alma mater, I had been able to graduate without the required courses in botany
              and geology. My friend had not been so clever. The result was that he found in the
              passing scenery, not mere dirt and dusty vegetation, but interesting geological
              formations, that possessed for him an absorbing interest, an interest that diverted
              his attention time and time again throughout the day. He was crossing familiar paths
              that I was too blind and ignorant to see. If we can build in the intellectual
              equipment of youth these familiar paths, leading into many and varied <pb
                id="VAC1001-150" n="138"/>phases of social and political life, rich in the romance
              and experience of youth, we will be building dynamic sources of power and energy, and
              developing a capacity for interest in one's community, that may yield large dividends
              for society in the years that are ahead. Those who receive such a training will be
              found better and more zealous guardians of the community's welfare. Against them the
              organized minority can not so easily prevail.</p>
            <p>In teaching the story of the community, the same fundamental principles already
              discussed and illustrated in previous chapters, should prevail. It will be my purpose
              for the remainder of this chapter to illustrate the application of those principles,
              in the study of local history, and to indicate how, thereby, a vital interest in
              community life may be developed. For purposes of illustration, I desire to use the
              city of Franklin, a typical Indiana town of about five thousand population. I select
              this town for the sole reason that I happen to know something of its history.</p>
            <p>To develop the spirit of critical inquiry, the teacher should begin with the setting
              of problems, not for his own decision but for solution by the pupil, acting under the
              direction and stimulus of the teacher. Such problems as would readily occur are the
              following: Why was the city named Franklin? When and by whom was it founded? Why was
              it located where it was? What are the forces that contribute to its growth? Other
              towns have grown up, only to become deserted. Why has not Franklin been deserted?
              These questions go directly into the fundamental problems underlying the community
              life, and yet they involve fundamental principles in their simplest forms, and capable
              of being comprehended in terms of the pupil's observation and experience. In the
              setting of such problems, the fullest possible appeal is made to the instinct of
              curiosity. <pb id="VAC1001-151" n="139"/>Methods of thought, analysis and observation
              are stimulated that too frequently are never employed. Things that before were
              regarded as monotonous and commonplace, under the stimulating genius of an artful
              teacher, now take on a deep and refreshing interest. But most important of all, the
              boy and girl are beginning to think, are beginning to have an interest in their
              community, and are beginning to come in contact with the vital facts of our social
              life.</p>
            <p>But a word of caution must be urged. Like any other method that is worth while, it is
              not perhaps so simple as it seems. It requires patience, tact and ingenuity. The whole
              idea would be wrecked if the teacher, having set the problem, should proceed to its
              solution. On the other hand, if left entirely to the resourcefulness of the pupil,
              time will be wasted, interest will lag and poor methods of thought and inquiry will
              prevail. The teacher must leave the solution to the pupil, but must tactfully keep her
              hand on the situation, suggesting here, restraining there, calling attention to bad
              methods, loose thinking, or unworthy evidence, and so contriving all the while, that
              the pupils will find their own solution and win their own triumph, before the problem
              has lost its interest and the children their zest.</p>
            <p>Take the problem of why Franklin still continues to enjoy a normal growth instead of
              becoming a deserted town. Put that problem to the class. Bring it home to them, and
              ask them to find a solution. Why do people continue to live in Franklin? Some member
              of the class, perhaps, has moved there because the father was a county official, and
              he lives in Franklin because he has to work there. Another child may contribute the
              information that he knows a family that moved to Franklin in order to put their
              children through college. It follows that if there is a courthouse and a college, that
              there must be living near them <pb id="VAC1001-152" n="140"/>the officers, teachers
              and students. These people must have groceries, clothes, homes and fuel. It must be
              the business of others, therefore, to supply these necessaries.</p>
            <p>Then, there are factories and mills that have to have workmen, and they increase the
              need for still other people who can serve them, such as barbers, doctors, lawyers, and
              all forms of businesses, professions, occupations and trades. But are these all? Some
              pupil will have already thought of the people living out in the country and tilling
              the land, who need food, shelter, coal, machinery, supplies, and all kinds of skilled
              labor and professional service. A very large percentage of Franklin's business comes
              from this productive source. Innumerable other matters will be suggested, thrashed out
              and tabulated as the children, stimulated by competitive zest, strive to bring new and
              significant facts to light.</p>
            <p>And what is the result? These children are learning, in a way they never will forget,
              the basic interrelationships that criss-cross through every phase and angle of
              community life. I know grown men to-day who do not seem to comprehend that there are
              mutual relationships between capital and labor, and who still cling to the theory that
              the destruction of one will mean the well-being of the other. I know intelligent
              business men and bankers to-day who do not realize these mutual relationships between
              the farmer and the business man, and who can not comprehend that one of the most
              effective ways to promote the wealth of the city is to increase the prosperity of the
              farmer. They are blind to the obvious fact that the purchasing power of farmer
              customers is directly conditioned upon the productive capacity of his toil.</p>
            <p>I know so called hard-headed business men to-day who can not see that the problem of
              a community building and promotion is largely a problem of cooperative efficiency, <pb
                id="VAC1001-153" n="141"/>in which the forces of all should be devoted to increasing
              the efficiency of each. In view of these well-known facts, the real importance of
              directing youthful thought along lines of accurate thinking can scarcely be imagined.
              To equip the child with the fundamental comprehension of these interrelationships is a
              splendid start in the development of the efficient citizen.</p>
            <p>It is not possible to follow out here many of the problems that might be suggested,
              and we will, therefore, restrict ourselves to a limited few. Take, for example, the
              problem of how Franklin received its name. Some pupil would undoubtedly guess that it
              was named after Benjamin Franklin, and there would then remain the question of why?
              Who was Franklin, and what was the evidence? A little investigation by the pupils,
              tactfully supervised by the teacher, would disclose the fact that Franklin was so
              named by the first Board of County Commissioners, upon the suggestion of one Samuel
              Herriott, the first clerk of Johnson County. Mr. Herriott had just read the
              autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, and was so impressed with the genius and greatness
              of the man, and the profound wisdom evidenced in the autobiography, that he took a
              direct interest in seeing that the city bore his name. Here is a natural and
              interesting introduction to one of the great men of America, and to a great
              autobiography. One student might be asked to give a brief report on Franklin, and
              another on his autobiography. Thus new lines of interest are opened up that reach far
              back into one of the significant periods of our nation's history, which the student
              will cross and recross with increasing interest and joy as he recognizes the old
              familiar paths.</p>
            <p>Another problem that should be set is why Franklin developed where it did. Why was
              not the town built farther east or west, or north or south? Was it a mere accident or
                <pb id="VAC1001-154" n="142"/>were there definite forces that controlled? What were
              these forces? Did the topography of the country have its influence? Did the fact that
              it was located in the center of the county, and therefore an appropriate location for
              a county-seat, have its influence? Did the building of the old state road from
              Madison, north, through what is now Franklin, affect the situation? What influence did
              the railroad have? Was the town located before the building of the railroad, or vice
              versa? These questions can not be answered here, but they illustrate the method of
              attack. A class of pupils that will grapple with these problems, and will make the
              recitation room a history laboratory, where all the students will bring their
              discoveries and ideas, and unite in the common effort for their solution, is receiving
              a training in civics that is sound, fundamental and dynamic.</p>
            <p>Another very interesting and valuable type of problem to propose is to determine the
              significance of the names given to the city streets. This is peculiarly suitable for
              the classes in the grades. Beginning with the streets passing the schoolhouse, the
              process may be carried on to all the streets of the city, omitting, of course, those
              whose names have been arbitrarily assigned. For example, one of the school buildings
              in Franklin is located on Hurricane Street. Whence did this name come? In the
              discussion and investigation that would follow, it would undoubtedly develop that it
              was called Hurricane Street because it was but the continuation of Hurricane Road. But
              why did the road bear that descriptive name? There is a creek running through Franklin
              that also bears the name Hurricane. Could there be any relation between the name of
              the creek and the road? The pupils may easily be led to discover that the road and the
              creek run through the same territory, which would rouse the presumption that there was
              a connection between the two.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-155" n="143"/>
            <p>Some of the pupils may learn through the interviewing of some of the old
              settlers&mdash;an experience that is both interesting and valuable to both the old
              settler and the pupil&mdash;or, perhaps by consulting the county history, that when
              the early pioneers settled in that neighborhood, they found along the banks of the
              creek and the adjacent territory, unmistakable signs of a hurricane having swept over
              that vicinity at some previous day. Thus the creek and the road, as well as the
              country neighborhood in that locality, have received the name of Hurricane. The idea
              of a hurricane would make a vital appeal to the imagination of youth, and would
              further stimulate curiosity in finding what other interesting stories might be
              concealed in the history of the community.</p>
            <p>Now, proceeding to the other streets in the vicinity, the other street on the corner
              is Madison Street, while the next two streets south are Jefferson and Monroe Streets,
              respectively. It would not require much time for the pupils to discover after whom the
              streets were named, and perhaps some interesting episodes in connection therewith, to
              attract additional attention. Here are introduced to the child's consciousness, in a
              psychological manner, three of America's great statesmen. There should follow a brief
              account of these men and their places in our country's history, in order that the
              pupil may understand why the city should seek to honor them by the naming of its
              streets. All this time the student is beginning to see, reflected in the story of his
              community, some of the history and romance of the nation. He is continuously following
              out new lines of interests that are as varied as they are vital. His increasing
              knowledge and experience will ultimately develop them into familiar paths of
              history.</p>
            <p>The most vivid single experience of my early school-days was obtained by such a
              method as I have described. I was <pb id="VAC1001-156" n="144"/>in the third grade.
              The teacher set us to the task of working out a map of Franklin. She did the drawing
              on the blackboard, extending streets and putting in the public buildings, as she was
              instructed by the class. I do not believe there was a member of the third grade that
              did not look forward to this period with genuine eagerness. Street names, peculiar
              angles in the highways, and similar details were so fixed in my mind that to this very
              day I am able to recall them. And all of this is in spite of the fact that we were
              working on a section of Franklin with which I have never since been familiar. This
              part of the city and its street names are far better fixed in my memory than are the
              portions of the city in which I was born and reared, as we never had time in our map
              making to get to the latter portion of the city.</p>
            <p>As I write these lines I can remember the zest with which we pupils vied with one
              another in getting information, finding unexpected little streets and alleys, and
              discovering mistakes in the development of the map. It was stimulating, instructive
              and pedagogical. This teacher had the problem of attention solved, from the beginning
              to the end of the work. The ingenuity, resourcefulness, and initiative of the pupils
              were all called into play. Significant information was driven home in a way never to
              be forgotten. Our interest in the community was being unconsciously developed. To this
              teacher, the study of the community was a very effective means of developing the best
              intellectual, social and moral capacities of her pupils. She was equipping them with
              the capacity, the interest, and the point of view for the militant type of citizenship
              that our modern life demands.</p>
            <p>Among many other street names in Franklin that carry a fascinating story is Oyler
              Street. Many of the pupils by inquiry at home, or by other means, will discover that
              this <pb id="VAC1001-157" n="145"/>street was named after Colonel Samuel P. Oyler, a
              veteran of the Civil War. There are many things in connection with the man's public
              career that the class would find helpful, interesting and inspiring. Perhaps the
              outstanding feature occurred, when, in the latter part of his life, he was elected
              mayor of Franklin. Among the issues that were involved in the election was the
              enforcement of the Sunday and liquor laws. Colonel Oyler enjoyed the reputation of
              being very liberal-minded on those subjects, and drew much of his support from men of
              like ideas. When he entered upon the performance of his duties, however, he astounded
              his friends and enemies alike by taking a courageous, high-minded and sincere attitude
              toward his oath of office. He had taken an oath to support the laws and constitution
              of his government when he entered the Union army, and that oath had been scrupulously
              and heroically observed during four long years of civil war.</p>
            <p>When he took his oath of office as mayor of the city, he did so with the same
              sincerity, devotion and determination that his oath should be observed inviolable,
              that characterized his career as a soldier and an officer upon the field of battle.
              The day he assumed his office, he issued a proclamation declaring his intention to
              enforce the law fairly and impartially, and with the best of his energy and ability,
              and he did as he declared. He was denounced, threatened and cajoled, but he never
              hesitated or deviated from his established course.</p>
            <p>Here certainly was a refreshing incident. Here was a man to whom patriotism was a
              duty of peace as well as of war; a man who had the courage of his convictions in
              politics as well as in battle; a man who was willing to accept a public office which
              most men of his career and reputation would have deemed beneath them, and make of that
              office an exalted duty to his city and to his nation. This story <pb id="VAC1001-158"
                n="146"/>ought to have a thrill for the teacher and the pupils alike, as they
              develop its details and comprehend its significance. Doubtless there are other equally
              important matters hidden in the commonplace names of those surroundings, that would
              prove of equal interest and value, and that would challenge the curiosity and
              resourcefulness of the youthful mind.</p>
            <p>There is, near the city we are describing, a highway called the Three Notch Road.
              Back of this peculiar name lies a very interesting story, vouched for by local
              historians, but the accuracy of which I have never seen verified. The unraveling of
              this story is an ideal problem to set to a class. Perhaps the most obvious clue which
              the pupils will discover is the idea of the blazed trail, and that this particular
              road was originally marked by a blazed trail of three notches. Few if any of the
              students will know anything personally of a blazed trail, but it is a subject that
              will intensely interest them, and here is an opportunity to introduce them to some of
              the customs and methods adopted by the pioneers.</p>
            <p>But the next question will arise of why have three notches when one would do as well
              to mark the trail. A little consideration and imagination will disclose the fact that
              trails occasionally cross, and travelers would become confused, if all trails were
              indicated by the same kind of notches along the way. But why was this three instead of
              two or four, or instead of bearing some other distinguishing mark? In answer to this
              question, it has been asserted that the trail was developed in pre-revolutionary
              times, and that the three notches were with reference to King George III of England.
              Here we find the name of a highway linking up with colonial history and in a very
              significant way, for additional questions at once suggest themselves. What people were
              traversing this territory at that time, and for what purpose? This will lead to the
              discovery of <pb id="VAC1001-159" n="147"/>information regarding the fur trade in
              those early days, and the traffic that resulted between the southwestern Indiana and
              southern Illinois districts, and the Toledo-Detroit region. The Three Notch Trail is
              declared to have been one of the trade routes between the two sections, and it is from
              that original source that we have the Three Notch Road of to-day.</p>
            <p>Another similarly significant highway may perhaps be mentioned with profit. Running
              in a southwesterly direction from Franklin is a thoroughfare known as the Mauxferry
              Road. The problem of tracing this name is an excellent one. An ingenious teacher would
              doubtless suggest, among other things, an analysis of the name itself, and it would
              logically follow that it had something to do with a ferry. The name of Maux would
              doubtless have some significance. Then would ensue an inquiry following up the leads
              contained in the name itself. By following the general direction of the road, by
              ascertaining when it was built, and what were the main cities or places of importance
              at that time and in that direction, considerable progress may be made. This line of
              investigation will lead one, among other places, to the Ohio River and to Corydon, the
              capital of the state in early times. Near Corydon is a town named Mauxport. The
              location of Mauck's Ferry should easily follow. A statute passed by the Indiana
              legislature in 1823 provided for the re-location of "a part of the state road, leading
              from Mauck's Ferry to Indianapolis." This road ended at Franklin, because it there
              joined the state road from Madison to Indianapolis.</p>
            <p>It must not be forgotten that some of these problems, being rather difficult and
              elusive, may require a great deal of aid from the teacher. It can not all be left, in
              many cases, to the unaided initiative and ingenuity of the pupil. But the teacher's
              aid should be by way of suggestive <pb id="VAC1001-160" n="148"/>questions, which
              would direct student initiative rather than supplant it. Like any other method of
              teaching, it will not succeed unless used with tact, judgment and discretion.</p>
            <p>Another group of problems that can be used in this connection is the working out of
              the history of the more important institutions of the community, such as the different
              churches and schools. One of the most interesting hours of my youth, and one that I
              can now vividly recall, was spent in hearing a venerable deacon in one of Franklin's
              churches, reading the history of the foundation and development of his church. He was
              one of those men who had not lost touch with humanity in his advancing years. In the
              story that he unfolded, he had not lost sight of the tragedy and the pathos, the
              heroism and the humor, and every one who listened was drawn nearer to the institution
              and the community it served, by the intimate and human account of a simple but moving
              narrative. He had the genius to see, in the apparently commonplace development of this
              institution, a deep human significance, and an account of the tireless toil and
              devotion of its early members, that was both stimulating and inspiring. Incidentally
              he gave to those of my generation an intimate insight into some of the customs and
              ideals of the pioneers. There are few churches in any community that can not produce
              an effective, interesting and stimulating story, if one will only get at the facts and
              have sufficient sympathy to sense the elements of human interest.</p>
            <p>In Johnson County, of which Franklin is the county-seat, there has been developed a
              system of consolidated schools that in many respects presents remarkable
              opportunities. Those who are teaching the history of that community will find there
              some splendid material. In the first place the problem should be set of accounting for
              the location of the school and then of its consolidation. What were the <pb
                id="VAC1001-161" n="149"/>conditions that prevailed before consolidation? What steps
              were taken to secure it? What about the struggle that was involved? What was argued in
              opposition? What was the nature of the arguments on either side? Here is introduced a
              vital public question, the wise determination of which required courage, foresight and
              vision. Here is a chance for the students, in developing the history of the community,
              to develop their own ideas and to begin habits of critical analysis and observation,
              as applied to the public problems of life. In such a study there is a sense of
              reality, and such a lack of pedantry, that its very realism gives it zest and
              interest. This splendid system of schools was not developed without hostile, though
              honest, opposition. The program was not accomplished without labor, statesmanship and
              patience. And what better place can there be for the pupil to learn that the every-day
              problems of the community demand these heroic and basic qualities?</p>
            <p>If the student can be brought to realize the importance of the task that has been
              accomplished; if he can come to appreciate and comprehend the local statesmanship that
              was involved, if he can learn to visualize the significance of the achievement and its
              results, he will have a new and enriched sense of the dignity, importance and
              opportunities of community leadership. When it is understood that much of this
              splendid record of accomplishment was due to the perseverance, vision and
              determination of the county school superintendent, these children will view with a
              clearer vision and a more adequate comprehension the real possibilities of this
              vitally important office, which have been too frequently ignored.</p>
            <p>The story of this community would not be complete without unraveling the story of its
              dominant institution, Franklin College of Indiana. Here, again, the problem approach
              may be very effectively employed. The college is located on <pb id="VAC1001-162"
                n="150"/>a little knoll on the east side of the city. One of the first problems
              should be why was the college located in Franklin? Why was it not built in some other
              city? Were there any peculiar reasons why Franklin, at that time, should be chosen as
              the site? Another set of questions would have to do with who founded the college. What
              interests contributed the money? What was their purpose and motive? What have been the
              chief factors in its development? These questions will lead into many interesting and
              informing discussions. They will display a missionary and altruistic spirit on the
              part of its founders, that children so frequently fail to identify with public
              institutions. In the vicissitudes of its early struggle for existence, there are
              stories of conflict, heroism and self-sacrifice, that will drive home vital lessons
              that can not be ignored. Normal, generous and sympathetic youth will respond nobly to
              such a story. They will find in it an opportunity for their altruistic and social
              instincts and emotions to seek expression. Thrilled with the spirit of exaltation that
              follows, they will learn the joy of service and the happiness of sacrifice.</p>
            <p>In every community, large and small, there is so much of the ennobling, the heroic,
              and the altruistic side of human effort stored away in the untold secrets of its life,
              that the opportunities are appalling and bewildering. As one tries to appraise the
              results that might follow, were these opportunities to be exploited in an effective
              way, one is dazzled by the possibilities one beholds. If these ideals, hopes and
              aspirations that one finds articulate in the story of every neighborhood, could be
              impressed into the impressionable consciousness of youth, what it would accomplish in
              the development of virile dynamic citizenship, it is almost impossible to
              estimate.</p>
            <p>It must not be supposed that the ideas I am here seeking <pb id="VAC1001-163" n="151"
              />to develop are for the sole and exclusive use of the teacher of local history or
              civics. It is to be hoped that teachers of English will find here suggestions for
              themes and compositions that will prove helpful and interesting. Certainly the topics
              here suggested would afford adequate opportunity for the student's self-expression and
              imagination. There are such elements of humor, tragedy, devotion and heroism in every
              neighborhood, to those who have the imaginative genius to find them, that the pupil
              will not lack for a sufficiently varied group of interests, to enable him to give
              expression to the diverse elements of his nature. Moreover, he is seeing these things
              more nearly at first hand, through his own observation and experience, and he is,
              therefore, much more likely to see the elements of tragedy and heroism as they really
              are, rather than as pictured by his favorite writer. When his contact with the forces
              of life is thus gained directly, there will be a sense of reality to it all, that will
              be most wholesome and inspiring.</p>
            <p>A distinguished school superintendent once told me of visiting the class in current
              events. He was a great believer in such work when properly handled, and always had at
              least two classes in operation, one in the high school, and the other in the two upper
              grades. Invariably, he said, upon visiting those classes, he found them discussing
              foreign events and matters of national interest at Washington. There seemed an
              unwritten rule against discussing events nearer home. State matters were rarely dealt
              with, and local matters were always ignored. And yet there are few communities that do
              not have their own local developments and matters of current interest. One ingenious
              teacher, working in a small town where there was a very live chamber of commerce,
              always included the important proceedings of that body in his course in current
              events. The result was <pb id="VAC1001-164" n="152"/>every student was thinking and
              studying in terms of the local community, and was acquiring the invaluable habit of
              making its problems his own.</p>
            <p>Teachers in charge of debating and similar work, may frequently find rare
              opportunities presented by the problems existing at their very doors. It goes without
              saying that it is such problems that have the fullest sense of reality to the student,
              and that he is most competent to discuss. A principal once related an incident that is
              significant here. His teacher of public speaking and argumentation was accustomed to
              assign the old trite problems for debate. He had not been succeeding, and the
              principal thought this to be an important cause of his failure. He suggested,
              therefore, that for their next debate they argue the question of whether the main
              street of the city should be paved. The teacher did not like the subject. He had no
              prepared arguments or selected bibliography "on tap." None of the debaters' guides or
              handbooks had outlined arguments or collected material on such a provincial question.
              Even the teacher's note-book was found unproductive on this vexing problem. Obviously,
              if such a question was to be debated, some one had to do some thinking, and display
              some resourcefulness, in the building of arguments and the gathering of material. The
              teacher did not understand he had been employed for that. He was hired to teach
              debating.</p>
            <p>Finally, the principal had his way, the subject was announced, and the preparation
              begun. It was decided, in view of the character of the question, to invite the city
              council to be present. This gave the students a new sense of the dignity and
              importance of the functions they were expected to perform. The students soon became
              enamored with their task, because it was real and practical. Their search for evidence
              brought them in contact with prominent members <pb id="VAC1001-165" n="153"/>of the
              community, and the city administration. They found these men interested and often
              holding contrary opinions. They found a stimulus in their task they had never found
              before, because it connected them up with life.</p>
            <p>In their quest for evidence, the debaters began to consider the example of
              neighboring cities. They investigated different types of paving, expenses of upkeep
              and repair, and the probable wearing quality of each. They discussed and argued it at
              home, with their friends, and every place they went, until most of the people in the
              little city were aware that the question was pending. The debate was a big success.
              They had the largest number of visitors that day in the history of the school. The
              question became a vital one for the community. A little more than a year later the
              street was paved.</p>
            <p>The pupils who participated in that debate had an experience they never could forget.
              They learned something of the thrill that comes to those who engage in honest conflict
              over public issues. They viewed their relations to the community and its problems as
              something more vital and important than they had thought. Their training for
              practical, civic accomplishment, had, in fact, begun.</p>
            <p>A departmental teacher of history in the seventh and eighth grades, in a little city
              of some three thousand inhabitants, tried this theory in teaching local history. She
              proposed to the class that they write a history of the county. The proposal met with
              spontaneous enthusiasm. In the meanwhile, the teacher had carefully prepared an
              outline for the class to use. The first problem she set to the class was the
              formulation of a plan or outline for their work. With the true artist's skill, she
              directed their energies and attention until they had developed a plan and outline that
              harmonized with her own. They would take up a topic at <pb id="VAC1001-166" n="154"/>a
              time, different aspects of the topics being referred to two or three students
              together, although all were welcomed and encouraged to produce all they could.</p>
            <p>After thrashing a matter over until they had all the evidence that was available to
              the students, the teacher sought to formulate a statement of the facts, as it had been
              established by their efforts. In the formulation of these statements, the students
              took the most critical care to see that no mistakes occurred, and that nothing was
              omitted. When the statement was so worded as to be acceptable to the class, then the
              teacher dictated it to the pupils, who copied it in their note-books. Thus they wrote
              the history of their own county. It was my privilege to inspect these note-books, and
              the results achieved were marvelous. The resourcefulness, the ingenuity, the historic
              spirit, and the interest in the community that it developed, were remarkable. These
              boys and girls walked several miles into the country to interview old settlers who
              might have some information that would be valuable. They hunted up the records of some
              of the old church organizations in order to trace the history of the local
              institutions. They sought out files of old newspapers, letters of old residents, and
              everything that curious students, or a resourceful teacher, could suggest.</p>
            <p>I talked with the superintendent about the results achieved, and found him entirely
              enthusiastic over the work done. He reported that the influence of that one class for
              that one year had done more to awaken the interest of the community in its history and
              development, than all other forces combined. The children in questioning their
              parents, and in interviewing others, had imparted something of their enthusiasm for
              the history of the community. The superintendent informed me that he had been
              compelled to ask the teacher to go a little slow, as other teachers were <pb
                id="VAC1001-167" n="155"/>complaining that they were unable to get their students to
              work, as they were too absorbed with their history class.</p>
            <p>It must not be supposed that the teacher's part in this method of approach is
              unimportant. It takes more resourcefulness and tact than the old-fashioned, pedantic
              methods required, but it avoids the deadly monotony that seemed inherent in the older
              system. The teacher whose work I have just described told me she thought she never did
              so much work as she did the first time the method was employed. It was her careful
              thought and preparation, however, that gave her such conspicuous success, and after
              the matter had been once carefully arranged and successfully carried out, it became
              much easier and increasingly interesting and delightful.</p>
            <p>The story of the community, if developed according to the suggestion here made,
              becomes an important and effective means of developing the evolutionary point of view.
              No child can follow this method without coming to the resistless conclusion that the
              principle of cause and effect operates as resistlessly through our social and
              political life as it does in the realm of science. He can not escape the conclusion
              that the community, like all social life, is a continuous process of development. He
              finds that advancement comes by growth. His whole view-point is adjusted to the
              wholesome idea that progress is by evolution, not revolution.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all. There comes also the habit of critical analysis and inquiry.
              Curiosity is aroused as never before, as he finds that his normal craving for romance
              and the heroic can be satisfied by studying the life about him. Critical analysis,
              motivated by the instinct of curiosity, and directed at the life and institutions of
              the community, has opened up new worlds of experience in which his imagination is free
              to roam.</p>
            <p>Again, as the vital life of the community is bared to him, <pb id="VAC1001-168"
                n="156"/>with all its realities of struggle, sacrifice and tragedy, there wells up
              in the ardent spirit of youth, a deep sense of obligation and devotion to those whose
              courage and heroism have won his youthful heart. The spirit of emulation quickly
              responds, and the pupil pictures himself as battling for the welfare and progress of
              the community. Thus we are building a sentiment of constructive patriotism, both
              virile and effective. In the study of the locality, there is constant opportunity for
              the appeal to instinctive and emotional life. The appeal, being based upon conditions
              with which the child is intimate, does not lose in its force, but gains tremendously
              in its practical value. This patriotic sentiment need not wait until the peace of the
              country is imperiled before it begins to function. It functions with each new public
              problem that confronts the developing intelligence of youth.</p>
            <p>The patriotic sentiment is thus strengthened, and its attention directed to the
              practical problems of the community, by the intimate knowledge which the pupil
              secures. One may view with great equanimity suffering, hardship and injustice, when
              visited upon strangers not within our sight. One may likewise calmly behold the
              government of his community becoming demoralized, rotten and ineffective, if his
              knowledge of the community is meager, his attachment slight, and his understanding of
              its real human significance very scant. But if he knows the community intimately, if
              he has felt a deep human interest in his history and struggle, if there has developed
              that sense of affectionate regard that comes with an intimate knowledge of group life
              and struggle, if he has learned to see beneath the surface and to read the deeply
              human significance of rotten and inefficient government, then he will respond. He will
              find here an ample challenge to his patriotism, his manhood and his self-respect. The
              parental instinct, accelerated by feelings of <pb id="VAC1001-169" n="157"/>outraged
              indignation, and all the emotional power of the patriotic and self-regarding
              sentiments, will be summoned to the struggle.</p>
            <p>Such a citizen will not be awed by the bluff, the determination and the desperate
              tactics of the determined, organized minority. He will not accept plausible accounts
              of the weird and resistless power of invisible governments that do not exist. He will
              neither seek nor accept the spiritual and moral alibis proffered by the smug, the
              complacent and the self-satisfied. He will not retreat in the face of his foe, though
              the hour be late, the conditions harsh, and the fight prolonged. He would no more
              desert his cause in the hour of peril than would our heroic soldiers have fled from
              the advance of their Prussian foes.</p>
            <p>I do not mean to imply that a single course in community history is going to
              regenerate completely our citizenship. I make no such absurdly pretentious claim. I do
              argue, however, that if the teachers of our public schools can devote themselves heart
              and soul to the social view-point, if they can make the various courses of the
              curriculum each yield its quota to the intellectual and moral training of the boy and
              girl, if they will lose no reasonable opportunity to inculcate in youthful
              consciousness a virile and passionate sentiment of patriotic fervor, if they will
              continually nourish, develop and direct the rich instinctive and emotional life of
              youth to respond to the call of human need, there will be developed in every community
              a few valiant leaders who will dare and do in defense of the community they have
              learned to love. And where there are leaders in such a cause, they will always find
              support. It is in the training of this leadership that the hope of our democracy must
              rest.</p>
            <p>It should be remembered that if every community could produce but one such leader in
              each decade, the future of democracy might rest secure. In the political battle <pb
                id="VAC1001-170" n="158"/>described at the opening of the chapter, one strong,
              virile and courageous leader could have organized his forces, held his men in line and
              secured the triumph of a righteous cause. To find, develop and train these leaders,
              and to lay the basis of a public opinion that will respond to their clarion call, is
              the task we must essay.</p>
            <p>A most important factor in the achievement of this end, is the available material, in
              the study of which the right qualities of heart and head may be developed. It has been
              the purpose of this chapter to demonstrate that in the story of the community are
              concealed vast treasures of suitable material. The particular community discussed was
              in no way unusual. Opportunities of a similar nature exist at the very threshold of
              almost every teacher in the land, and yet how often has it happened that local history
              and civics have failed to yield results? How many of these opportunities are being
              seized by the other teachers in the performance of their various tasks? What we need
              is a human outlook on the problems of the school, a vision of its fullest and richest
              possibilities, and an imagination and resourcefulness in connecting up its activities
              with the vivid realities of life. We fail to see the splendid possibilities before our
              very eyes.</p>
            <p>In his famous lecture entitled <hi rend="i">Acres of Diamonds</hi>, Russell H.
              Conwell tells of an ancient Persian who, desirous of great wealth, decided to seek his
              fortune in a search for diamonds. He sold his farm, left his family in charge of a
              neighbor, and departed on a long but fruitless quest. At last he became discouraged.
              His money was gone. He had nothing left but poverty and wretchedness. Goaded by
              desperation, he sought relief in self-destruction, and was heard of no more. While
              this tragedy was taking place, a diamond was accidentally discovered in the sands of
              the farm that the old Persian had abandoned. The owner, in great excitement, rushed
              out into the garden to dig the sands, and <pb id="VAC1001-171" n="159"/>discovered
              many and more valuable gems than the first one he had found. Thus it happened, that
              had the old Persian "remained at home, and dug in his own cellar, or underneath his
              own wheat field, instead of wretchedness, starvation, poverty and death, in a strange
              land, he would have had <hi rend="i">Acres of Diamonds</hi>."</p>
            <p>The teacher who can glimpse the real significance of his task, who can keep in touch
              and sympathy with the vital incidents of current life, who can come to the study of
              his own community with both sympathy and ingenuity, such a teacher will not need to go
              to alien peoples or foreign lands to find materials for his task. In the very vicinity
              where he works, in the daily environment of his life, and in the commonplaces of his
              surroundings, he will find the opportunities that he seeks. For the teacher who is
              alert, every community has its "acres of diamonds" at his very door.</p>

            <p><hi rend="b">T</hi>WO or three decades ago, Clay County, Kentucky, was made notorious
              by the Baker-Howard feud. The mountain whites, as they were called, seemed unable to
              resist the primitive call for vengeance. Descendants of the purest Anglo-Saxon stock
              of which our nation boasts, they sacrificed all other interest in devotion to their
              bloody task. The feud drained the community of its finest men. It sapped their
              productive energies. It left widows and orphans, poverty and desolation, in its wake.
              It paralyzed the social and moral life of the community. It imposed an effective
              barrier to the beneficent influences of civilization, and condemned the children to
              lives of ignorance and crime.</p>
            <p>Out of the very tragedy and suffering of the community came the leadership that was
              to save it. James Burns was caught in the meshes of the Baker-Howard feud. He had
              fought in many of its battles. In one of them he was wounded and left for dead. Upon
              recovering consciousness he painfully made his way to a distant part of the mountains
              where he could have rest and allow his wounds to heal. In the days of meditation that
              followed, the futility, the tragedy and the wickedness of the struggle in which the
              community was absorbed, came home to him with vividness and force.</p>
            <p>He left the mountains and sought employment where he could. For a time he was a
              roustabout on a boat on the Ohio River. Finally he found his way into West Virginia
              where he had relatives and where he became settled for a time. While here, he united
              with a church and definitely <pb id="VAC1001-174" n="162"/>dedicated his life to the
              Christian ministry. Feeling the need of education, he spent a few months attending
              classes in a university. But he could not resist the call of the mountains. He
              returned to Clay County to teach and preach to the folks among his native hills. He
              became convinced that Christianity and education were the only forces that could save
              his neighbors from the evils of moonshine and the destruction of the feud. Despite the
              discouraging words of his friends, he determined to build a school in the very center
              of his native county.</p>
            <p>He began by calling together twelve old men from the opposing clans. He reasoned that
              the older men were less belligerent, and more inclined to accept an appeal for a
              régime that would be better and more peaceful. He won them over to his cause, and they
              signed their names as trustees to an application for a charter for Oneida Institute.
              He then faced the task of persuading the younger men to support the work. He summoned
              them to a meeting in an old mill. They came, about twenty-five from either side,
              heavily armed. This was the hour for which he had long prepared. With native eloquence
              and an obvious sincerity he pleaded for his cause. He described, from his own intimate
              knowledge, the evils of the life they led. He portrayed their own dislike and
              disapproval of the system that they endured. He declared that they hated the life they
              lived, that their sons were being reared for slaughter, and that the only way to end
              the bloody business was to stop it then and there, and "to let Christian education
              take the place of rifle practise, and progress supplant destruction."</p>
            <p>Unable to resist the force of his logic and personality, they agreed to a temporary
              cessation of hostilities. He had won their consent but not their cooperation. They
              would wait to see what he could do.</p>
            <p>In the words of Doctor James M. Stifler:</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-175" n="163"/>
            <q rend="blockquote"><p>"He had his vision, his faith in God, and about twenty cents
                with which to start a school in the heart of the mountains; but he did it. He begged
                a bit of land on an ideal site on condition that he put a schoolhouse on it. He took
                an old crowbar and, with the use of the blacksmith's forge, he made a set of
                stonecutter's tools. With his own hands he quarried out the rock, and all alone one
                morning, with God for his audience, he laid the corner-stone. His prayer of
                dedication was interrupted by the crack of a young feudist's Winchester, fired at
                random as a taunt.</p>
              <p>"Alone he wrought with that masonry. Shamed by his self-sacrifice, a near-by farmer
                gave him fifty dollars in money, a tremendous sum. Others brought rough lumber and
                laid it down near his growing foundation walls. With his own hands he dressed those
                hard oak timbers and boards. And so he got his material for the building. The fifty
                dollars paid for the hardware and glass. Many a night, too tired to walk the four
                miles to his home, he lay down on the shavings and slept, and many a day, when no
                one offered him food, he went out and hunted pawpaws and berries to keep himself
                alive. Fired by his vision, and the actual appearance of his building, others came
                and began to help him with a day's work, and so the building was erected."</p></q>
            <p>The school opened in 1899 with one hundred students and three teachers, including Mr.
              Burns. The latter had to earn a living for a large family while doing his teaching,
              which covered subjects entirely new to him. It was with the greatest difficulty that
              he kept ahead of the class. But the work grew. The school flourished. His personality
              won the hearts of the people. His sincerity and common sense commanded their respect
              and confidence. The fight was won.</p>
            <p>In a brief time the attendance grew to five hundred students. The school property was
              soon valued at one hundred thousand dollars. In Clay County and the four adjoining
              counties, seventy-five per cent. of the teachers of the <pb id="VAC1001-176" n="164"
              />district schools received their training at Oneida. With the opening of the school
              the old feud spirit steadily declined. Since then there has not been a serious
              outbreak. There has developed a new generation of boys and girls that hate bloodshed
              and destruction. The evils of moonshine have been more stubborn in their resistance,
              but they have "constantly declined in popularity and profusion." This community, in
              the midst of the Cumberland Mountains, forty miles from a railroad, has been
              regenerated by the leadership of a single man. The despair of our civilization but a
              few years before, this county has become the hope of the mountain region. This
              illustration stands out as the great example of what can be accomplished in the most
              hopeless environment, by a great teacher who has vision, faith, courage, personality
              and common sense. The knowledge of this triumphant experience in the Cumberland
              Mountains should be a continuing inspiration to those in quest of opportunities to
              serve. To those who seek to instill the spirit of service into others, it should be an
              example of resistless power.</p>
            <p>Before we began the study of rural life and government, I wanted the reader to have
              his emotions aroused and his imagination fired by the dramatic story of Clay County's
              educational pioneer. Here was a man who found his "acres of diamonds" in the
              environment of his daily life. He saw the rich opportunities of his humble community.
              In the mountains of Kentucky he found a challenge to his manhood and patriotism. It
              was in the meeting of this challenge that he sprang to immortal fame.</p>
            <p>This should illustrate in an effective way the opportunities afforded by life and
              government of a rural community. No one can teach rural local government in such a way
              as to develop leadership, stimulate effort, and create a dynamic, constructive
              patriotism, who ignores the life of the <pb id="VAC1001-177" n="165"/>community. It is
              only when government is expressed in terms of life that it becomes interesting and
              real. It is only when its success or failure becomes written into the lives of the
              people that it is either significant or important. It is only in so far as government
              plays a rôle in the service of the group that it is worth our while. Rural life must,
              therefore, be intimately associated with rural government, if we are to teach it
              effectively, interestingly or accurately.</p>
            <p>But instead of attacking the problem of rural government and life, we have too
              frequently ignored it. We have been impressed with the rapid growth of gigantic
              cities. Our attention is gripped by the dramatic setting of the conflict between
              capital and labor. Our interest is engrossed in the impelling problem of monopolies
              and trusts. These varied interests, because of the spectacular setting they enjoy,
              have too easily blinded the popular eye to the problem of the rural life and
              government. While interested in the destiny of the great cities of the country, we
              forget that over half of our people live in rural communities. While absorbed in the
              vexing problems of labor, we neglect the fact that one-third of the workers of the
              country draw their living from the soil. While astounded and perhaps alarmed at the
              tremendous growth and centralization of industry, we fail to realize that the capital
              invested in farming, and protected by rural government, almost equals the total amount
              of wealth invested in manufacturing and transportation.</p>
            <p>The whole problem of the farm, with all its fundamental questions, comes within the
              purview of rural life and government. Its political and economic importance is
              convincingly set forth by President Butterfield of Massachusetts Agricultural College.
              "We are aware that agriculture does not hold the same relative rank among our
              industries that it did in former years, and that our city population has increased far
              more rapidly than has our rural population. We do not <pb id="VAC1001-178" n="166"
              />ignore the fact that urban industries are developing more rapidly than is
              agriculture, nor deny the seriousness of the actual depletion of rural population, and
              even of community decadence, in some portions of the Union. But these facts merely add
              to the importance of the farm question. And it should not be forgotten that there has
              been a large and constant growth both of our agricultural wealth and of our rural
              population. During the last half-century there was a gain of five hundred per cent. in
              the value of farm property, while the non-urban population increased two hundred and
              fifty per cent. Agriculture has been one of the chief elements of America's industrial
              greatness, it is still our dominant economic interest, and it will long remain at
              least a leading industry. The people of the farm have furnished a sturdy citizenship
              and have been the primary source of much of our best leadership in political, business
              and professional life. For an indefinite future, a large proportion of the American
              people will continue to live in a rural environment."</p>
            <p>With these facts in mind the teacher is able to show the pupil the tremendous
              importance of this phase of his study. Moreover, it is hoped that in meditating along
              the lines of thought here suggested, the teacher will grasp the fuller significance of
              the rural life problem to the welfare and future of the nation. In giving emphasis to
              the fundamental significance of the agricultural problem, President Butterfield
              pertinently inquires if the farm problem is merely one of technique, plus business
              skill, plus certain economic principles.</p>
            <q rend="blockquote"><p>"Is it not perfectly possible that agriculture as an industry
                may remain in a fairly satisfactory condition, and yet the farming class fail to
                maintain its status in the general social order? Is it not, for instance, quite
                within the bounds of probability to imagine a good degree of economic strength <pb
                  id="VAC1001-179" n="167"/>in the agricultural industry, existing side by side with
                either a peasant régime or a landlord-and-tenant system? Yet would we expect from
                either system the same social fruitage that has been harvested from our American
                yeomanry?</p>
              <p>"We conclude, then, that the farm problem consists in maintaining upon our farms a
                class of people who have succeeded in procuring for themselves the highest possible
                class status, not only in the industrial, but in the political and the social
                order&mdash;a relative status, moreover, that is measured by the demands of American
                ideals."</p></q>
            <p>This is not the place to discuss in detail the rural life problem, but with the
              attention it is now receiving by eminent leaders and scholars, it needs no words from
              me to emphasize its importance. It is one of the problems democracy must solve. It is
              one of the questions that the citizens of the future must be prepared to meet. Any
              civic training that does not recognize this fact and does not correlate this basic
              problem with the other problems of our democracy, is inadequate, if not misleading.
              The political importance of sound rural life is persuasively stated by Professor
              Gillette.</p>
            <q rend="blockquote">"The farmer's advance does not mean others' injury, but his
              progress in all good things will contribute to the general upbuilding. His advance
              means the promotion of the common good. His better education means the intellectual
              enrichment of all other classes. His improvement in leadership so that he is competent
              to take care of his interests in county, state and nation will bring about a
              revolution in political life which will offset the undue influence of special
              privilege in government. If the cities are corrupt and hold the balance of power for
              evil, as some would contend, an enlightened and strengthened agricultural vote would
              act as a countervailing influence."</q>
            <p>Ex-President Roosevelt emphasized the national interest in rural life in the
              following passage:</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-180" n="168"/>
            <q rend="blockquote">"Our civilization rests at bottom on the wholesomeness, the
              attractiveness, and the completeness, as well as the prosperity, of life in the
              country. . . . Upon the development of country life rests ultimately our ability, by
              methods of farming requiring the highest intelligence, to continue to feed and clothe
              the hungry nations; to supply the city with fresh blood, clean bodies, and clear
              brains that can endure the terrific strain of modern life; we need the development of
              men in the open country, who will be in the future, as in the past, the stay and
              strength of the nation in time of war, and its guiding and controlling spirit in time
              of peace."</q>
            <p>It is with problems of such basic importance that rural government is vitally
              concerned. In introducing the topic, however, let us not forget the functional
              approach. Let us first understand the family and its fundamental importance. Let us
              organize the experience that the child has gained in the home, into terms of law,
              authority, government and functions. Let us fashion out of the materials of his daily
              life, the concepts that will become his working tools in the study of his government.
              In the chapter on the functional approach, we have seen how local government came into
              existence because of needs which individuals and families working independently, could
              not secure. An enumeration of the functions of rural government, an emphasis upon
              their importance to the community, and a discussion of why they could only be
              performed through cooperative effort, would be a very fitting introduction. It must be
              remembered, however, that to do this too hastily or briefly would defeat the very end
              we have in view. The idea should not be developed more rapidly than it can be fully
              comprehended. Having once been fully comprehended, it should be repeated time and time
              again, until this method becomes a habit of thought, and the functional approach an
              established point of view. The institutions, rules and regulations of the rural
              government, must not appear to the student in any other <pb id="VAC1001-181" n="169"
              />light than as obviously necessary instruments for the achievment of the common
              purposes of the group. When this necessary relation between government and functions
              is definitely established, then we are ready to begin to describe and analyze the
              framework of government itself.</p>
            <p>In beginning this phase of the study we should begin with the question "Why?" We have
              already met the problem of why rural government of some kind is necessary. The
              particular departments of government will be found to have come to meet some of the
              particular needs. But this will not explain the different methods adopted in different
              sections of the country to meet the local needs. For instance, we find in New England
              that the basic unit of rural government is the town, while in the South we find it to
              be the county. Why should there be this totally different emphasis? In a previous
              chapter we found that those two types of government were the definite result of the
              difference in the economic, social and topographical conditions of the two sections of
              the country.</p>
            <p>But in other sections of the land we have still different types of rural government
              which seem to be mixtures of the two types just suggested. Whence came these types?
              What conditions or influences created them? These are problems that should be solved.
              It should not take long to discover that there were some colonies where the conditions
              were not the same as those of New England and yet different from those in the South,
              as Pennsylvania, for example. In such a colony one might expect to find neither the
              county nor the town fully developed, but a compromise of the two, which is just what
              one finds.</p>
            <p>There are two forms of the mixed type of rural government which are generally called
              the "county-precinct" and the "township-county" types respectively. In the first, the
              emphasis is on the county and it more nearly resembles the <pb id="VAC1001-182"
                n="170"/>southern type. In the latter the emphasis is on the town and is more
              similar to the towns of New England. Some states have one form, some states have the
              other, while several states, such as Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and North
              Dakota have both systems in different sections. Here are some other very interesting
              problems. Why do some states have one kind and other states another? Why do some
              states have both? What is the explanation of this diversity? Moreover, history shows
              us that in some states there has first been established the "county-precinct" type
              only to be later changed to the "township-county" type, but there have been very few
              changes, if any, the other way. What is the explanation here?</p>
            <p>The township-county type was first found in Pennsylvania where it was doubtless due
              to a compromise between the opposite types to be found in the colonies to the north
              and south of her. It was largely through the influence of Pennsylvania that this type
              was introduced in the Northwest Territory. But what has been the determining
              influences in many of the later states? This problem will not be difficult to solve,
              and doubtless some pupil will guess its solution in the beginning. In states where the
              people from New England dominate, the emphasis will be on the town. Where, however,
              the state is settled largely by people from the South, the emphasis is the opposite
              and the county-precinct plan is found.</p>
            <p>But how about the states where both systems are found as in Illinois? There the
              problem is the same. It was a compromise between the different views of people coming
              from different sections of the East. Interest in the problem is still further
              increased by the fact that originally there was only one type, and that the
              county-precinct type, while to-day the great overwhelming majority have the
              township-county form. A little thought and investigation will show <pb
                id="VAC1001-183" n="171"/>that the first constitution of the state provided for the
              county-precinct type. But why was this the case? This will lead to an inquiry as to
              the early settlers of Illinois which would show that they came largely from the South.
              The later settlers, however, came largely from the New England and Middle States, and
              therefore favored the other type. These people had so increased in numbers that when
              the constitution of 1848 was adopted, they secured a provision giving to each county
              the right to adopt the township basis of organization if it so desired.</p>
            <p>The county or county-precinct plan being simpler, more symmetrical, more easily
              managed, was generally considered better adapted to thinly settled districts.
              Especially was this true in states originally settled from the South. But when
              population increased, more interest in town government began to develop and those from
              the New England states began to urge some form of township-county government. Thus we
              find, in tracing back the historical origin of our rural government, an interesting
              story which connects us up definitely with the early days and life of the Republic. We
              also find, what is equally important, that some of our governmental forms to-day are
              merely historic survivals that have no special reference to the particular functions
              they are intended to perform. Certainly the realization of this important fact is a
              part of the training for effective citizenship.</p>
            <p>By this method of treatment another valuable by-product is achieved. The student is
              freed from the dogmatic conviction, too frequently preached, that the town government
              of New England was the result of the moral and political superiority of the Puritan.
              There still clings to my boyhood knowledge of history, the idea that the town meeting
              was a result of the virgin love of liberty, while the county government of the South
              was the product of those who <pb id="VAC1001-184" n="172"/>worshiped aristocracy
              rather than democracy. During my days in the public schools these two forms of
              government were used as additional evidence, if any might be needed, of the inherent
              moral perversity of the South and the spiritual superiority of the North.</p>
            <p>Whatever may be said of the relative moral qualities of the two sections, as
              evidenced by the growth of human slavery in the section where it yielded the greatest
              profits, certainly nothing is to be gained, and much may be lost, by such mischievous
              efforts to misread history, and to create hatred and suspicion over incidents that in
              nowise merit them. History and institutions should be interpreted in the light of
              truth and life, and not in the service of an ulterior cause, however worthy it may
              have been. That the people of the South adopted a county form of government, has no
              other significance than that they were sufficiently hard-headed and practical to build
              the kind of government that best met their peculiar needs.</p>
            <p>Another unfortunate result of the "holier than thou" interpretation of the New
              England town meeting is the popular conception that it has helped to create in favor
              of a blind naive insistence upon the principle of home rule as a panacea for public
              ills, and as the natural and inalienable right of every American community. The idea
              of home rule, when properly understood and limited, may be a very valuable concept to
              American statesmanship. But when urged with stubborn insistence against every kind of
              state administrative control over the technical aspects of local problems, it becomes,
              not an instrument, but an obstacle of progress.</p>
            <p>I can well remember when as a youth in the public school, I had to forego the use of
              slates and substitute therefor pencil and tablet. The State Board of Health had
              determined that certain primitive methods of cleansing the <pb id="VAC1001-185"
                n="173"/>slates, in which children seemed determined to indulge, were insanitary and
              the board therefore ordered the abolition of slates from the public schools. I can
              remember some of the local opposition that it aroused. What right had the State Board
              of Health to interfere with the rights of the community? The fact that it saved life
              and prevented disease was nothing, compared with the outrageous violation of
              fundamental right. "Kill our children, but permit us home rule," seemed to be the
              unconscious logic of their cry.</p>
            <p>The same point was well illustrated by a more recent incident. A state had created a
              state commission to regulate the public utilities of the commonwealth. In the course
              of time it had occasion to lower the rates charged by many local utilities. It had a
              corps of engineers, accountants and economists, men who were expert in these problems,
              who could make an examination, determine the facts and make a just and fair decision.
              No single city could afford to develop such effective machinery for the solution of
              its problems. It meant, therefore, that the community must depend upon the state
              machinery, or ignore the problem, or try to solve it without sufficient expert advice,
              in which case justice and wisdom would be quite difficult, if not impossible, to
              obtain. This seemed the best solution that was at hand.</p>
            <p>But it encountered opposition. A "home rule" league was organized to fight this
              "unwarranted invasion of American rights." I listened to one of its founders give an
              eloquent address in its behalf. Not once did he argue that the locality could provide
              better machinery for the solution of the problem. Not once did he argue that the new
              system was incompetent or inefficient. Not once did he argue that it would not do
              justice to all concerned. His one and only plea was that it violated the principle of
              local autonomy. <pb id="VAC1001-186" n="174"/>He painted in glowing terms the New
              England town meeting as the birthplace of American liberty. He eulogized the ideal of
              home rule as the very flower of American democracy, consecrated by the blood of
              heroes. It was this ideal for which the fathers fought and died upon the frozen hills
              of Valley Forge. To have this ideal blighted by the humiliating spectacle of a state
              commission fixing the price of gas in his native city outraged his red-blooded
              Americanism and challenged the foundations of our democracy.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to believe that a man making such an appeal could take himself
              seriously or be taken seriously by others, and yet he was. Here was a need for
              critical observation, for freedom from the tyranny of established phrases, for relief
              from the evils of static dogmatism. Here, again, the public were asked to sacrifice
              substance for form, human interests for literary phrases, and fiction for fact. When
              we can get our students to revering government only as a means to legitimate and
              worthy end; when they will measure the value of phrases and conceptions by their
              contributions to human weal, rather than by the perfection of their rhythmic cadence;
              when local government and home rule are studied only in the light of their actual
              contributions to human happiness, instead of being blindly worshiped as patriotic and
              inspiring phrases, then we may hope for progress. No laws, no public regulation, no
              political panacea can stay the reign of the demagogue. His rule will continue as long
              as our civic body will respond to "bunk" instead of brains, and to fiction instead of
              fact. And this in turn must, to a large extent, depend upon the training of the public
              school.</p>
            <p>Then let us start right at the very beginning. Let us approach the study of rural
              government as but an organized expression of the community life. Let the student learn
              (let him become so impregnated with the doctrine that it <pb id="VAC1001-187" n="175"
              />never can be forgotten) that the institutions and laws that constitute his rural
              government, are but the conscious devices or instruments which men have adopted as the
              basis of their cooperative efforts to meet and solve the problems of their common
              life. Let them realize that this was true of the fathers as they built up their town
              meeting in the North and the county government in the South. Let them never forget the
              test of these different plans is the service that they render. And let them not forget
              that the glory of the fathers consisted, not in the false assumption of their
              perfection, but in their ability to see life as it was, to build institutions that
              fitted into the conditions that they confronted, and to face courageously and
              effectively the tremendous problems that barred the pathway of national progress. If
              they would emulate the inspiring examples of colonial patriots, it will not be by
              worship of the trite, the pedantic, or the orthodox, but by studying the problems of
              to-day and bringing to their ultimate solution the same courage, critical vision and
              common sense that characterized the statesmanship of the fathers.</p>
            <p>We now come to a detailed consideration of rural government. Just as we used the
              functional approach to show the necessity and nature of rural government in general,
              so we should use it in developing the various departments of the local organization in
              particular. For example, if we want to take up the health department of the local
              government, we would begin with the problems of public health. The general nature of
              disease, with particular reference to those that are communicable, should be taken up.
              The importance of health should be emphasized. The many ways in which the sickness of
              one affects the health of others should receive attention, while the general subject
              of epidemics, with the tragedy and terror that accompany them, should have careful
              consideration. These all contribute to the very <pb id="VAC1001-188" n="176"
              />important problem of bringing home to youthful consciousness the importance of the
              public health, the impossibility of adequate protection by private enterprise, and the
              corresponding importance of the health department of the government.</p>
            <p>There are few subjects that would offer better opportunities for effective emotional
              appeals and which are better adapted, therefore, for the social and patriotic training
              of the child. It is when government becomes consciously connected with such problems
              that the lesson of individual responsibility may be driven home, and the sentiment of
              dynamic Americanism may be developed into an effective force for better and more
              efficient government.</p>
            <p>The opportunities for this dramatic appeal to the instinctive life of youth seem so
              many and so obvious that they scarcely require discussion. From an economic standpoint
              the question of health is a matter of startling importance. It has been stated on good
              authority, that the special expense involved in administering to the sick in this
              country represents five hundred million dollars every year. The total annual loss from
              illness, due to diminished production, has been estimated at another five hundred
              million dollars. The loss to the country yearly, of productive power, through the
              premature death of workers, is estimated at another half billion of dollars, which
              brings up the total economic loss to one billion and a half. Suppose we could save a
              considerable portion of this loss, think what a saving it would mean to the
              struggling, toiling millions of our land. To-day, when the excessive cost of living is
              bearing down with such cruel and deadly force upon the families of so many, sapping
              their vitality, killing ambition, and bringing misery and want, this increased
              production would have a deep human significance that it would be difficult fully to
              comprehend.</p>
            <p>But we are here dealing only with the economic aspects <pb id="VAC1001-189" n="177"
              />of the situation. What about the sorrow, the heartaches, the loneliness, the orphans
              and the destitution that sickness can produce? Here again the importance of the public
              health can easily be brought home to the experience and understanding of youth, and he
              will begin to understand local government in terms of human interest.</p>
            <p>When these matters have been sufficiently discussed, then we are ready to inquire
              what provision in our local government has been made for the public health. The local
              officers in the particular government and their official powers and duties may then be
              briefly discussed. The emphasis, however, should not be upon the technical matters of
              law and government, but upon the importance, to the community, of the particular
              duties entrusted to their care. We want the students interested primarily in results
              and their achievement. We want them to remember, with a vividness that can not be
              forgotten, the importance of those official functions. We want them never to forget
              the tragedy that will follow the failure properly to perform them, and the splendid,
              magnificent results that follow from their faithful and efficient discharge. If we can
              accomplish this, we will have tied up the dynamic forces of the child with the
              efficiency of the local office. We will have created a patriotic sentiment that will
              function as aggressively and effectively in these basic problems of peace as it has in
              the more dramatic affairs of war.</p>
            <p>The care of the charitable and penal institutions of the locality is another
              important function entrusted to local government. The possibilities of the use of the
              orphans' home as a means to bringing home to pupils, in an intimate and dramatic way,
              the vital importance of local government, has been discussed in a previous chapter.
              Opportunities of the same nature are provided by the other charitable as well as the
              penal institutions of the community. No one <pb id="VAC1001-190" n="178"/>with normal
              sympathies and a reasonably human outlook on life could fail to be touched by the
              pathetic incidents of men and women, who in old age find themselves helpless, without
              friends and yet dependent upon the care of others. The arrangements provided for their
              care by the local government, thus becomes a matter of very vital interest.
              Mismanagement and incompetence may mean not only heartbreaking cruelty and hardship,
              but the abuse and perversion of a very important institution to improper and unworthy
              ends. An institution that is managed with care, judgment and vision, is doing a humane
              and noble work, that gives to every thoughtful citizen a thrill of pleasure, and a
              sense of pride, that makes him a better citizen and a nobler man. But let the
              institution fall into disrepute and the average citizen avoids all thought and
              contact, because he desires to shun the thought of misery which will give him pain. In
              time, he becomes hopeless and cynical regarding government and politics, and is
              content to leave them to the care of others.</p>
            <p>Nothing succeeds like success and nothing tends to quicken pride and interest in
              local government so much as the successful creation and administration of these
              institutions. The sympathetic appeal and the noble achievements they are able to
              accomplish will not fail to catch the popular imagination. How to start the public
              interest enough to secure the initial success, is the fundamental problem. Like many
              problems that have to do with public opinion and individual responsibility, it will
              have to be solved largely by the educational process. The child must learn in his
              youth the dramatic possibilities that are involved. He must have an emotional and
              instinctive life developed, that is keyed to this class of appeals. He must have
              learned that in attacking and solving just such problems as these, he will find that
              joy and exaltation for which he longs, and which comes to <pb id="VAC1001-191" n="179"
              />every normal youth in the performance of altruistic deeds. Our problem is so to
              connect the splendid, buoyant, emotional powers of youth with the problems of the
              community that in their solution he finds a challenge to his manhood, his heroism, and
              his patriotic sentiment.</p>
            <p>When the possibilities of these institutions have been made clear, then the part of
              government responsible for their control should receive attention, until the
              importance of the office involved is made specific, vivid and clear.</p>
            <p>One very important set of functions generally entrusted to local government is the
              question of law enforcement. In approaching this problem let us forget none of the
              preliminary essentials, if the pupils are to have the right point of view regarding
              the nature and function of law, and the necessity for its interpretation and
              enforcement through the power of the community and the state. It would be far better
              to ignore it completely than to approach it with the "taking everything for granted"
              attitude. Let us first review the necessity for rules of conduct in the home, and the
              necessity for some one in authority who could lay them down and give them force. Then,
              as neighborhood and community problems develop, cooperation became as necessary
              between the homes as it had been before, within the home. But cooperation could not
              take place without principles or laws, any more than baseball could be played without
              rules. Therefore, there grew up a body of rules or laws, some of which originated in
              the customs of the people, while some have been developed by the courts, as they have
              tried to lay down fundamental principles as a basis of deciding disputes that come
              before them for decision. Still other rules have been adopted by the state
              legislature, an institution which will be studied later.</p>
            <p>The necessity of law as a basis of community life should be made clear. In the olden
              times, each family would make <pb id="VAC1001-192" n="180"/>its own clothes, shoes and
              shelter; each family would do its own butchering, prepare its own foods, and live its
              own life, largely independently of others. But the clothes were coarse, the shoes
              inferior, the houses without modern comforts and conveniences, and the food greatly
              restricted in variety, kind and quality. There was little wealth in those days, and
              what the working man regards as necessities to-day, were then regarded as the
              prerogatives of kings and queens.</p>
            <p>But with the industrial revolution and the use of steam and machinery, things could
              be manufactured much more cheaply than before. This, however, required the division of
              labor. Men no longer made their own shoes and clothes, but they could be better and
              more cheaply made by machines in factories, and obviously every man could not have a
              machine and factory for his own shoes. And so the process developed until one man made
              shoes, another pins, another machinery, etc., throughout the whole of industry. Thus
              society became complicated, and each depended upon the work of others for many of the
              necessities of life. A man who made shoes received wages, and with wages he purchased
              from others the things he had to have. The farmer sold his produce and bought in town
              shoes, clothing and food. All of these exchanges and arrangements could not take place
              unless there were rules governing their conduct. There had to be rules governing
              contracts in order that persons might make arrangement to purchase the things they
              needed, and feel sure that when the time came, they would get that upon which they had
              agreed. It was necessary, therefore, to have rules determining what constituted a
              valid contract, that fraud must not be employed, that undue advantage should not be
              taken, that contracts should be properly interpreted, and then when properly made,
              they should be observed.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-193" n="181"/>
            <p>Think of how helpless one would be where there were no rules or customs governing
              contracts, and therefore where binding agreements were impossible. One could not buy
              or sell a farm on credit, for there would be no way of knowing whether the money would
              be paid. One could not hire a man to work upon the farm for he would not know when, if
              ever, he would get his pay, and the farmer would never know how long the man might
              stay or when he might refuse to work. Much of modern life is based upon contracts of
              one kind and another, which would be impossible without rules or customs governing
              them.</p>
            <p>But this is only one small class of examples illustrating the need of law. Take the
              public health measures, especially those dealing with epidemics, and consider how safe
              one might be if there were no such laws or if they could be defied with impunity.
              Suppose that a person afflicted with smallpox were allowed to roam the streets, attend
              school and church, and mingle freely with the public. There would follow an epidemic
              of smallpox that would cause untold suffering, anguish and loss of life. The health
              and safety of all are thus dependent upon the adequate quarantine laws and their
              efficient administration.</p>
            <p>Then there are pure food and drug laws that are enacted to protect the individual
              from drugs and foods that are impure or unwholesome. One can not go to a chemist to
              test the purity of foods or drugs every time one buys them, and it therefore becomes
              necessary for the state to enact laws that will prevent the sale of improper articles,
              and will compel the manufacturer to state expressly just what the article contains.
              The injuries to health and happiness that have been wrought through the continuous use
              of impure and poisonous drugs would afford a story of human tragedy that would make
              one wonder why more such laws have not been enacted.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-194" n="182"/>

            <p>Then there are laws that are passed to protect liberty and property. Most of us live
              in such peace and security that we forget that it is only through the wise enactment
              and efficient administration of the law that this peace and security is achieved. To
              emphasize the importance of this fact, a gifted teacher whom I know, asked a pupil who
              had a very pretty necklace, if she passed anybody on her way to school. She asked her
              if the necklace were valuable. If so, why did not the man that she passed take the
              necklace from her? He could easily have done so, had he tried. If she answered it was
              because the man was good and kind, then she was asked if the man would have taken it
              if he had been cruel and wicked. Here an interesting discussion developed, involving
              policemen, jails, fines, etc., but out of which confusion finally came the
              consciousness that it was the potential power of the state, in the last analysis, that
              protected the necklace.</p>
            <p>This can be carried further by asking the girl what would happen to her necklace if
              she were living in the more lawless parts of Mexico, or in some section of benighted
              Russia where law and order have not yet been established. The alternative to an
              adequate system of law and its efficient enforcement, can be brought home with such
              striking effect that it will have a marked effect on youthful understanding. Let the
              pupil have glimpses of what has happened to innocent and self-respecting folk in our
              own land on those special occasions, when, for the time being, anarchy has supplanted
              law. The recent race wars and some of our industrial conflicts will afford sufficient
              evidence.</p>
            <p>These several topics should be so studied and considered that the value of lawful
              government makes an irresistible appeal to the imagination, the impulses and the
              sentiments of youth. The very real terror and menace of anarchy <pb id="VAC1001-195"
                n="183"/>should be driven home, until the sentiment of patriotism will respond as
              vigorously to defy the forces of lawlessness within, as it does to oppose the foreign
              foes without. This sentiment does not involve a static conception of the approvel of
              the established order, but a deep and intimate understanding of the necessity of
              lawful processes to human progress. This sentiment is based upon the proposition that
              law and liberty are in concord, not in conflict, and that evolution, not revolution,
              affords the surest means of progress. Our youth must gain this conception, if it is to
              profit by the history and experience of the race.</p>
            <p>We are now ready to approach the local departments of government that look after the
              enforcement of law. If the necessity of law has been made clear, the student is
              prepared to recognize the tremendous importance of these officers. He sees their
              importance to the community. He can readily glimpse the terrible consequences that
              would prevail should they lack courage, or conviction. The importance and significance
              of rural government thus comes home to him with vividness and conviction. As partly
              responsible for its success or failure, his opportunities and duties as a citizen will
              make a strong appeal to the generous and heroic impulses of youth.</p>
            <p>Another function of rural government is the education and training of the youth in
              the public school. It would be difficult to find a subject of greater social
              significance than the rural schools. It is significant that the great bulk of thinkers
              and writers upon the rural life problem tend to find in the development and perfection
              of the school, the hope of the community, and the solution of its problems. Space does
              not permit a discussion of this fascinating problem, with which thinking teachers are
              perfectly familiar. The transcendent importance of this subject is so obvious as to
              need no further comment. To reduce this information <pb id="VAC1001-196" n="184"/>to
              the terms of the experience of the child would seem to require no special aid.</p>
            <p>There are many examples and many splendid books that bring out the facts in an
              interesting and convincing way. Perhaps the best method of approach is to relate the
              achievements accomplished in some neighborhoods by a rural school that has been
              efficient and successful and where the teacher has developed a high degree of
              community leadership. The effect on the social life of the community has frequently
              been far-reaching and important. The study of problems of agriculture and domestic
              science by the pupils and their demonstration upon the farm has taught many a parent
              invaluable lessons that he had thought himself too old to learn. The organization of
              corn clubs, pig clubs and calf clubs has stimulated private initiative, brought home
              the value of scientific training, encouraged business methods and systems of
              accounting, provided profitable and interesting employment during vacation periods,
              increased the production of the community, and established habits of thrift, foresight
              and frugality, that will yield large dividends through life.</p>
            <p>The development of the idea of the civic center with the gathering together of the
              people of the community, has helped to restore to farm life something of the old
              thrills and comradeships that gave the bright and glowing colors to farm life in the
              days of the barn raisings and the husking bees. In these gatherings they thrash out
              their common problems, study out cooperative methods for their improvements, and as
              they unite in the solution of their common problems, they learn anew the joy and
              thrill of common enterprise. There seems to be no limit to the dynamic force that can
              be generated through the developments of community consciousness. Such a revolution in
              a rural community means a spiritual and social regeneration of rural <pb
                id="VAC1001-197" n="185"/>life. Farm life passes from a competition in drudgery to a
              competition in business management and scientific effort. Barren isolation gives way
              to cooperative effort. Study, community activity and intelligent planning afford
              alluring variations from the monotony of manual toil. Farm life becomes not only more
              productive but more abundant. It has a broader outlook and a spiritual quality that is
              more dynamic and profound. And out of this all comes a better citizen and a broader
              man.</p>
            <p>That this regeneration may come through the influence of a rural school may seem
              unduly optimistic. But in relatively short periods, many of these things have been
              actually accomplished. And we have yet only scratched the surface of the possibilities
              that lie ahead. It is with such a program as this, based upon specific accomplishment,
              that we may enlist the interest and enthusiasm of the pupils. Once they get the
              vision, they have gone a tremendous stride in the preparation for effective
              citizenship. Local government, with its rural school, will remain for them a matter of
              more than passing interest. It will mean to them the possible realization of a dream,
              both graphic and alluring.</p>
            <p>It will be impossible to treat of all the functions of rural government and the
              machinery adapted for their performance. Enough has perhaps been written to suggest
              some helpful methods of approach by which the subject-matter of the chapter may be
              utilized in the intellectual and moral development of the boy and girl.</p>
            <p>But it must not be supposed that the subject of rural life and government is
              completed with a consideration of governmental functions and the appropriate
              machinery. Perhaps this has been one of our great mistakes. We have not always seen
              that training for citizenship in a bigger and broader conception than training for the
              suffrage, as fundamental and important as that is. There are innumerable <pb
                id="VAC1001-198" n="186"/>duties of citizenship that find no connection with the
              ballot box, and yet that are essential to an aggressive and militant democracy. There
              are many community enterprises, requiring cooperative efforts, that are essential to
              the fullest and best life of the people, that are not provided for by the forms of
              law. Some of the finest public service that I have ever seen has been performed
              outside of public office. In modern life, there are innumerable appeals that challenge
              the best and noblest instincts of the race, that can best be met through the
              initiative of private enterprise. A citizen who does not respond to this appeal, who
              can not cooperate with his fellows in response to such a call, who feels no sense of
              personal accountability for the public weal, is not prepared for the duties of
              democracy.</p>
            <p>One of the needs found in every community is the religious one. Men have always
              sought religious expression, whether it be in the fantastic rites of barbarism or in
              the cultivated forms approved by the modern church. In modern times men have organized
              for the effective expression of religious life, whether in the forms of theological
              controversy, religious wars or the service of humanity. With the growth of
              civilization and the spread of intelligence, the church has developed to meet the
              spiritual needs of the new life. Many of its earlier functions have been supplanted by
              secular institutions. But there still remains important work for it to do.</p>
            <p>Modern religion represents a vast storehouse of dynamic force. When intelligently
              interpreted, it meets deep-felt wants in the lives of all. This force should be
              developed and utilized. Some institution must provide the means by which the religious
              aspirations of the people may become articulate in their daily life. The church, if
              properly conceived, may answer this deep-felt want. Here the religious emotion may be
              nourished and directed. Here men and <pb id="VAC1001-199" n="187"/>women may meet on
              the common ground of humanity. Here, under proper leadership, they may get a clearer
              vision of life, a higher conception of its duties, a nobler idea of humanity. Such an
              institution will not solve the technical problems of the community, but it may develop
              a generous ardor, a moving spirit of altruism, and a genuine sense of community
              fellowship, that will provide the motive and desire to support effectively the
              leadership of the intelligent and informed in the fields of technical endeavor.</p>
            <p>Students of rural life have emphasized the evils of isolation, lack of fellowship,
              and the absence of spiritual and altruistic motive. Here certainly is an institution
              that will tend to break through the barriers of isolation, bring the people together
              in the bonds of human fellowship and religious aspiration, and give to their life and
              effort a spiritual and human touch that is so much required. It is the purpose of the
              church, when properly conceived, not to restrain and hamper life, but to give life and
              to give it more abundantly.</p>
            <p>Related to the work of the rural churches is the work of the County Young Men's
              Christian Association. Its purpose is declared to be the uniting "in a town, village,
              rural community, or in the open country, the vital forces of young manhood for
              self-government, physically, socially, mentally and spiritually, and to give
              expression to these resources in community life for the betterment of others." Its
              method of operation is "to discover, enlist, train and utilize leadership." It seeks
              to organize the energies and activities of the young men of the community into lines
              of useful and beneficial endeavor. Wholesome recreation, formation of good habits,
              emphasis upon right living, and the service of God through service to the community
              are some of the things it seeks to stimulate. In some cases buildings are erected, and
              secretaries are employed as means of perfecting the <pb id="VAC1001-200" n="188"
              />organized social and spiritual life of the community. What such an organization can
              mean in the life of a lonesome country boy, eager for companions, responsive to true
              leadership, and anxious to participate in the team work of the community, it is
              impossible to say.</p>
            <p>But these organizations require financial support, membership, loyalty and
              cooperation as essentials to their success. Unless our boys and girls have seen the
              crying needs, unless they have felt the importance of their success, unless they have
              developed a patriotic sentiment that functions in terms of social as well as political
              life, they are not prepared for true community citizenship.</p>
            <p>Another voluntary organization, already referred to, is the civic center. It
              generally centers about the school and involves the organization of the various
              interests of the community. Farmers' institutes, women's clubs, domestic science
              clubs, university extension courses, boys' clubs and similar organizations function
              through the civic center. The good that results from such development is obvious. It
              is another foe to isolation, extreme individualism and mutual suspicion. Here the folk
              find comradeship, altruism, broader vision, sympathy and tolerance. Here they learn
              the value, the importance, the necessity and the thrill of cooperative endeavor.</p>
            <p>But all of these things require leadership, vision, courage, loyalty to the community
              interest, and the capacity to lose one's self in the interests of all. Here is another
              demand upon the citizenship of the future that we must meet. Here is another aspect of
              constructive patriotism for which we must provide. The efficient citizen is not
              merely, therefore, an intelligent voter or a valiant soldier. He is one that lives
              through and in the life of his community, whose patriotism is as broad as humanity and
              as powerful as the deepest instinct of human nature; and who finds joy and <pb
                id="VAC1001-201" n="189"/>zest in the continuous struggle toward the development of
              a community life that is wholesome, generous and dynamic.</p>
            <p>It may be suggested that the books in civics which the teacher is required to use may
              not be suitable to the task at hand. Certainly some of them are not inherently suited
              to the method or point of view that I have attempted to defend. This does not mean,
              however, that they may not be so employed by the teacher who has the courage,
              imagination and inventive genius to find a way. If a text is devoted primarily to the
              structure of government, then the functional approach may be easily supplied by any
              teacher of intelligence and zeal. If, on the other hand, much is said of functions and
              the definite organization through which the functions are performed is too briefly
              treated, it will not be difficult to provide sufficient material of a supplementary
              nature. This is quite frequently necessary, particularly in reference to local
              government. But whatever be the problem, let us face it squarely and remember that our
              task is to make the citizenship and not to teach the text. Let us seek no alibis in
              the fancied mistakes of the man who wrote the book. Let us not forget that social,
              moral and intellectual training is our immediate aim and citizenship our goal.</p>
            <p>What will be the significance of this new rural citizenship in the life of a nation
              as a whole? Increased production will contribute its quota to ease the cost of living
              and bring relief to the poor and impoverished. The half of our people, those upon the
              farm, will have found a more joyful and more abundant life. But more important still,
              the whole nation will have gained from a new citizenship whose broad vision, generous
              ardor, and warm blood will introduce a new and vital element into our national life.
              At present we seem torn by the convulsions of a class struggle that is stern and
              bitter. Its ultimate decision seems fraught with <pb id="VAC1001-202" n="190"
              />imminent peril. If labor should establish a supreme control, it would hardly do
              justice to the public and its opposing foes. If capital should control the nation in
              the selfish interests of its class, justice would suffer and peace would not endure.
              Some place between the two extremes, there must be the golden mean. Some place from
              American citizenship there must arise a group who care not for the dictates of capital
              nor the demands of labor, a group that recognizes no loyalty save to the ideals of our
              nation, no creed save that of justice, no ambition save the service of humanity. With
              half of our citizens upon the farm, removed from immediate participation in industrial
              welfare, it is from the rural life that such a group will largely come. In the
              reconstruction of rural life then we are reestablishing the foundations of our
              democracy.</p>

            <head rend="center sc">CITY LIFE AND GOVERNMENT</head>
            <q rend="blockquote">"<hi rend="b">T</hi>HERE is no denying that the government of
              cities is the one conspicuous failure of the United States. The deficiencies of the
              national government tell but little for evil on the welfare of the people. The faults
              of the state governments are insignificant compared with the extravagance, corruption,
              and mismanagement which mark the administration of most of the great cities."</q>
            <p>These words of James Bryce, representing as they do the mature reflections of a
              distinguished statesman and scholar, must challenge the attention and interest of
              thoughtful citizens everywhere. Moreover, while his criticisms are leveled primarily
              at the governments of great cities, there is much evidence that the governments of
              smaller cities have been subject to just rebuke. Perhaps their evils have not been so
              gross or their misconduct so criminal, but it would scarcely be denied that they have
              failed to express accurately the best ideals and aims of American democracy.</p>
            <p>In the same chapter in which this distinguished author uttered his condemnation of
              city government, he expressed the hope that better days were ahead, as he saw the
              people awakening to the evil and demanding adequate reforms. "Rogues are less
              audacious. <hi rend="i">Good citizens are more active</hi>. Party spirit is still
              permitted to dominate and pervert municipal politics, yet the mischief it does is more
              clearly discerned and the number of those who resist it daily increases. In the
              increase of that number and <hi rend="i">the growth of a stronger sense of civic duty
                rather than in any changes of mechanism</hi>
              <pb id="VAC1001-205" n="193"/><hi rend="i">lies the ultimate hope for the reform of
                city governments</hi>." (Italics are mine.) Subsequent developments have vindicated
              this hopeful prophecy, and yet there is much that remains to be done.</p>
            <p>There was a time when it seemed that city government was hopeless. The people,
              absorbed in business enterprise, in the quest for markets and the competition for
              trade, seemed to view the misery and hopelessness of city life with a cynical
              indifference. They seemed to take it as an inevitable result of city growth. They
              lacked the imagination, the sympathy and the human understanding to see in the great
              proportions of the modern city, the real hope of democratic achievement. For where men
              are gathered together in great throngs, united in the interests of a common life and a
              common economic destiny, there is opportunity for team work and cooperative
              enterprise, such as can exist in no other way. The slums and tenements of a great city
              seem to offer little hope for human amelioration, but when one sees them replaced with
              model tenements, modern playgrounds, social settlements and civic centers, one gets a
              glimpse of the brighter vision that is yet to come.</p>
            <p>If the industrial city, with its miserable hovels and desolate tenements, where
              children are born to open their eyes on scenes of poverty, misery and disgrace; where
              they are reared amid the corrupting influence of crime and immorality; and where their
              only heroes and heroines are too frequently the successful sneak thieves or the
              painted women of the streets, if such a city will reflect, in the lives of its poorer
              children, the cynical and blighting influences that made the environment of their
              youth, then the hope and the possibilities of the city become clear. For the
              environment can be changed. Crime can be blotted out. The miserable hovels can be made
              to disappear. The civic center and the school can replace the brothel and the den.
              Supervised <pb id="VAC1001-206" n="194"/>recreation in public playgrounds can supplant
              the unorganized play amid the evil influences of the city streets. Civic art,
              expressed in innumerable different forms, may replace the desolation of the filthy
              streets, with their wretched tenements. The gang instinct of the boy may find
              expression in the directed efforts of athletic leagues and civic clubs instead of in
              the criminal pranks of hoodlum gangs.</p>
            <p>Travelers tell of visiting cities of Europe where the little children of the streets
              whistle and sing the great music of the masters, while our children know only the
              rag-time of the dance-hall. Just as these children reflect in their musical taste the
              influence of their environment, so will they reflect in their personalities, their
              characters and their lives, the ideals and aspirations that they find expressed in the
              life around them. If they live amid an environment where the spiritual, the altruistic
              and the human find an adequate expression, and where the community radiates the joy
              and hope of democracy and opportunity, these forces will find articulate expression in
              their lives and deeds. In these cities where there are found such marvelous
              opportunities to provide an ideal environment for the boys and girls, is to be found
              much of the hope for an improved and perfected democracy.</p>
            <p>This vision of the city as one of the hopes of democracy must come to the teacher if
              she is to teach municipal life and government with the interest and imagination that
              their importance merits. It is only when one's own imagination is fired with vision
              and conviction that there comes the largest power to carry the lesson and inspiration
              to others. And it is in this vision that one must find a large part of the dynamic
              force with which to enlist and stimulate the instinctive and emotional life of the boy
              and girl.</p>
            <p>The study of city life and government must be begun with the proverbial question,
              "Why?" Why do we have <pb id="VAC1001-207" n="195"/>great cities where people live in
              such congested conditions, where rents are raised so high, where housing conditions
              become so difficult, and the dangers and complexities of life increase with such
              tremendous speed? Why have not the people remained upon the farm and in the rural
              communities, where these particular and more glaring evils have not appeared? A glance
              at statistics will show that the growth of cities has been tremendous in the last
              century particularly in the latter half. In 1850 the percentage of people living in
              cities of over eight thousand inhabitants was only twelve per cent. In 1860 it had
              increased to sixteen per cent., in 1900 to thirty-three per cent. and in 1910 to
              almost thirty-nine per cent.</p>
            <p>These figures have been so startling to many that there has grown up at various times
              a storm of protest against the rapid growth. "Back to the soil" has become a slogan
              with many movements, whose only aim has been to prevent the growth of powerful and
              wicked cities. But the problem is more fundamental than these enthusiasts have been
              willing to admit. Therefore it is important to set to the student the problems
              presented by this marvelous development in city growth. Why has it been so rapid? What
              forces have contributed? Are they permanent forces? Can people be educated so that
              they will not flock in such great numbers to the cities? These are fundamental
              questions that can not afford to be slighted, and that provide the ideal materials for
              class-room work, particularly among the more advanced grades.</p>
            <p>As these problems are put to the class, the first response will probably represent
              the personal reactions of the class to the relative attractiveness of rural and city
              life. In spite of the many drawbacks of city life, there will be those who prefer the
              life of the city to that of the farm. It is well known that thousands will
              deliberately live in poverty in a <pb id="VAC1001-208" n="196"/>city, rather than in
              reasonable respectability upon the farm. The reasons for this will help to drive home
              the needs of more social life upon the farm which has been emphasized in the preceding
              chapter. They dislike the isolation. They long for the crowd, for human relationships,
              for the interest and zest of the day, things which too frequently are entirely lacking
              in rural life. It would seem, therefore, that if people are to be made content with
              rural life, and the rural movement is to meet with any success, that it must be
              through some kind of regeneration of rural life as has been previously suggested.</p>
            <p>But will this take care of the entire problem? If the great majority of the people
              desired to return to the farm, would it be possible? This brings up the question,
              which will occur to students very readily, what will the people do upon the farm?
              Moreover, if everybody leaves the city, what will the manufacturers do for the labor
              to man their factories and produce the manufactured goods that the farmer has to have?
              It will soon become obvious to the class that such a wholesale movement would involve
              fundamental industrial and economic changes.</p>
            <p>The nature of these changes may be illustrated by reversing the questions. What
              happened in the middle of the last century when the people began to leave the farm and
              move to the city? If in 1850 only twelve per cent. of the people lived in cities and
              now thirty-nine per cent. live in cities, what has the farmer done for labor on the
              farm? Since people can not live without the food and clothing that comes from
              agricultural production, how has the production been maintained, with the great shift
              of people from the farm to the city? Here is a problem that goes to the very gist of
              the situation. How can sixty-one per cent. of the people now do the work upon the
              farms when eighty-eight per cent. were required in 1850? A little ingenious <pb
                id="VAC1001-209" n="197"/>questioning will draw out the significant fact that much
              of the work now done by machinery was then done by hand. This introduces the whole
              subject of the industrial revolution and the application of steam and machinery to the
              various methods of production and distribution.</p>
            <p>The children by inquiring at home as to methods of agriculture employed in the youth
              of their parents, and by comparing them with the methods of to-day, will not lose much
              time in discovering that, through the invention of machinery and mechanical power, one
              man now does as much work upon the farm as was formerly done by many. A comparison of
              the old and modern methods of harvesting, thrashing and sowing grain will bring this
              out in a clear and vivid manner. It has been declared that one man now does as much
              work upon the farm, with the aid of labor-saving devices, as was formerly done by
              fifteen. In other words machinery has tended to supplant man labor upon the farm. But
              what became of the men whom the machinery had displaced? If one man now does the work
              formerly done by fifteen, what has become of the other fourteen who are thereby left
              without employment? It will doubtless be suggested that if they stay upon the farm
              they will starve or live on the bounty of others, since there is no work there for
              them to do. Then what could they do?</p>
            <p>In the meantime it may be wise to set another set of problems. Who is making the
              machinery that is being employed upon the farm? Who manufactures the thrashing
              machines, the drills, the mowers, the tractors and the other new devices that have
              revolutionized agricultural methods? Do not these industries require labor for which
              there had been no previous demand? Where did the big factories get the men they
              needed? The answer now seems obvious that the men released upon the farm secured
              employment in the factories that were springing up as if by magic. For <pb
                id="VAC1001-210" n="198"/>with the application of steam to machinery and
              manufacturing, the industrial productivity of the nation increased by leaps and
              bounds. The demand for manufactured goods increased not only with the growth of
              population but with the rapidly expanding wants of a prosperous people. The luxuries
              of one decade became the necessities of the next. In the meantime, the demand for
              agricultural products only increased about as rapidly as the population, since man's
              capacity to consume the products of the farm tends to be stationary, while the demand
              for manufactured articles increases with his inventive genius and the desire for
              luxury and conveniences.</p>
            <p>But this creates another set of problems. Why do the factories locate in the cities?
              Why should the tremendous increase in manufacturing mean a corresponding increase in
              the population of urban centers? These problems will not be difficult for the children
              to answer when their attention is called to the benefits of large scale production.
              This means that factories to be productive must be large. This involves the employment
              of a large number of employees who must obviously live in the vicinity of the factory.
              For instance, one steel plant may employ ten thousand men. These employees, with their
              families, and the mechanics, the artisans, professional men and merchants who serve
              them, will furnish the population for a city of considerable dimensions. It is this
              process multiplied many times that produces our greatest cities and that has increased
              the total urban population of the country.</p>
            <p>But this merely raises another problem. Why do these factories gather in the same
              cities or localities, resulting in the tremendous cities that we have? Why do they not
              scatter out more, relieving the congestion where it is the worst? This raises some
              very interesting questions, which the children should be interested in solving. Take,
              for <pb id="VAC1001-211" n="199"/>instance, the city of Chicago. Why have industries
              flocked to Chicago? Why have they not scattered to other cities where property would
              be cheaper, home-building easier, and the worst problems of the great city could be
              evaded? Are there any special reasons why one would want to erect a great factory in
              or near Chicago? Take another city, Gary, Indiana. This city has grown from a mere
              desolate sand-pile in 1905, to a city of over sixteen thousand in 1910. What caused
              this marvelous development in five years? The answer will be rather obvious to many.
              It was the building of a great steel plant there that made the city. But why was the
              steel plant erected at that point? Why should the directors of the steel plant pick
              the sand-hills of northern Indiana, bordering upon Lake Michigan, for the location of
              their plant? Was there a valid reason or was it the mere whim or caprice of the
              directors? What advantages would they find in this location?</p>
            <p>These questions go to the very bottom of the question of the location and building of
              cities. The student should be directed to inquiry along the lines of the influence of
              transportation, the proximity of raw material, the question of supplies of fuel, and
              similar matters which lie at the bottom of the questions propounded. Let them look at
              the map of the United States with particular reference to the cities of Chicago and
              Gary. Call their attention to the fact that the railroads east and west across the
              northern portion of the United States have to converge at some common point on or near
              the south end of Lake Michigan in order to get around the lake.</p>
            <p>Then call their attention to the cheap system of transportation provided by the Great
              Lakes and the nature of the country that is tapped by this system. This includes the
              rich mineral deposits of Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, the coal deposits of
              Pennsylvania, and markets for the <pb id="VAC1001-212" n="200"/>finished products in
              eight states, and some of the most populous and wealthy sections of the Dominion of
              Canada. In addition to this, is there any significance in the fact that Chicago is
              located near the cheap coal fields of Indiana and Illinois? From all of these varied
              factors, it will not be difficult to understand, and for the children to discover, why
              the territory covered by Chicago, Gary and the neighboring cities, was selected as the
              site for many manufacturing enterprises.</p>
            <p>From these considerations the children learn anew that cities, like other phenomena
              of our political and economic life, do not merely "just happen," but are the result of
              some antecedent causes. Since the application of steam and machinery to agriculture,
              manufacturing and transportation, great cities have been inevitable and the location
              has been determined by considerations of industrial efficiency and strategic relation
              to sources of raw material, markets for the finished product, and cheap and effective
              means of transportation. The industries that were erected without regard to these
              considerations could not compete and disappeared. Thus city life in America is not the
              result of the whim or caprice of our people, but the inevitable outcome of inexorable
              economic laws.</p>
            <p>Several distinct gains are achieved by this method of approach. In the first place,
              it helps to fasten upon the child the evolutionary point of view, with its insistence
              upon tracing results back to their ultimate causes. City government, the growth of
              great centers of population, their location in particular places&mdash;all these
              factors have back of them great principles of social and economic laws, in accordance
              with which our municipal life evolves. In the explanation of these causes lies an
              appeal to the instinct of curiosity and a challenge to one's intellect, that it seems
              almost criminal to neglect. Of almost equal importance is the sane <pb
                id="VAC1001-213" n="201"/>and accurate attitude toward city problems that is bound
              to follow. To one who has thus approached the problems of municipal government and
              life, the absurd notions that have from time to time prevailed, that the hope of our
              nation lies in the return of our people to the farm and rural community, will fail
              entirely of its appeal. For such an appeal is fundamentally opposed to economic laws
              that will not be denied.</p>
            <p>The citizen with such a training and approach will regard the city as a necessary
              problem, and he will center his energies, to the extent that he be interested, not
              upon the hopeless task of its destruction, but upon the more practical program for its
              solution. A vast gain will have been made when we take this attitude toward the city,
              and when we recognize that its wickedness is not an inherent element in city life, but
              the mere product of civic blindness and neglect. The solution of our city problems is
              not the destruction of our cities, but the education of their people. The very
              conditions of congested population that emphasize its wickedness and horror are the
              opportunities for a program of public education and social training that no other
              conditions can produce.</p>
            <p>As a result of the fact that economic laws have determined the location and
              development of cities, it follows quite naturally that economic considerations have
              been the controlling elements in the building and planning of the cities that have
              been built. In the desire to recognize and observe these more obvious economic laws,
              certain other considerations of the highest importance have been ignored. In the
              planning and arrangement of cities, it too frequently has been forgotten that the city
              is not only to be the site of industrial production, but also the home of the people
              who produce. Considerations of health, civic art, public convenience, and ordinary
              comfort have been ruthlessly <pb id="VAC1001-214" n="202"/>ignored. As a result,
              beautiful sites that should have been preserved for parks and playgrounds have been
              monopolized by industrial interests. Consider what an unobstructed lake front, running
              through the entire south side of Chicago, and devoted to a public park, would mean to
              the people of Chicago, but most of it is ruined by a group of railroads that have
              monopolized the shore.</p>
            <p>Factories have been built without regard to whether the surrounding territory is a
              fit and wholesome place for the families of employees to make their homes. The people
              would live the best they could. Unscrupulous landlords, taking advantage of the fact
              that people have to live where they work, have built dreary, desolate tenements,
              without regard to health, comfort or decency, and the people, left without a choice,
              have had to make these tenements their homes, at rents that too frequently have been
              exorbitant.</p>
            <p>With this unfolding of the causes that have produced our cities, we are now ready for
              the problem of municipal government itself. And again we begin with the question,
              "Why?" Why have a special government for the city? Is not the government of the
              township or county sufficient for the people's needs? Are there new forms of
              cooperative effort necessary in the city to solve problems that did not exist in the
              rural districts? It takes but little imagination for the boy or girl who understands
              the gigantic size of some of our cities, and the economic factors that determined
              their development, to begin to see the problems that inhere in the conditions of a
              congested population. Things that are safely left to individual discretion in rural
              life could not be so left in the conditions of the modern city. Garbage removal,
              sewerage disposal, fire protection, water supply, traffic regulations, building
              restrictions, city planning, provision and regulation of market facilities, regulation
              of street-cars, busses and other forms of urban transportation, <pb id="VAC1001-215"
                n="203"/>housing conditions, parks and playgrounds, adequate systems of police,
              prevention of disease, prohibition of nuisances, paving and cleaning of streets and
              the preservation of peace and order, are among the many peculiar problems that
              confront the people of a city. Life in a city would soon become unbearable unless
              these problems were partly solved at least.</p>
            <p>A mere recital of the problems is sufficient to indicate that they can not be solved
              either by private enterprise or the simple organization of rural government.
              Therefore, additional government is required, and the people have established it.
              Municipal government, like the organization of the family, or the machinery of a town
              or county, thus comes into being as a means to very definite and important ends. And
              it is only as it meets these ends, solves these problems, and serves the people of the
              community, that it can be said to be successful. This conception can not be emphasized
              too frequently, and any presentation of any form or kind of government, in any other
              way than so as to emphasize this fundamental fact, is to that extent failing to
              prepare and equip the student for effective, aggressive citizenship.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it should be made clear that the many regulations and restraints that are
              made upon the lives and liberties of the people, are not made for their inconvenience
              but for their service. It is entirely too easy for us to regard some of these
              regulations that vex us with their restraints, as arbitrary interferences with our
              individual rights. This attitude is, no doubt, responsible for no small portion of the
              disrespect for law that seems entirely too prevalent in America. It is this
              unintelligent and mistaken conviction that makes a policy of law enforcement almost
              impossible in regard to many things. Nor is there reason to believe that this
              situation will be remedied until the great majority <pb id="VAC1001-216" n="204"/>of
              our people recognize the importance and significance of law and government, and their
              absolute necessity to the accomplishment of the things that most of us hold dear.</p>
            <p>When we can view the laws of the community the same as we view the regulations of the
              home, as the wisely adopted measures to insure the enjoyment of our liberties and
              powers, then may we hope for permanent reform. When we can comprehend that government,
              in a democratic country, is nothing but the basis or instrument through which the
              people cooperate for the better ordering of their lives, we may expect a more
              intelligent attitude toward the problems of government and law. When the first city
              ordinances against the abominable habit of expectorating upon the sidewalks were
              enacted, they were practically impossible to enforce. But with the proper education
              about the dangers of communicable diseases and how easily they might thus be spread,
              the enforcement of the ordinance became much easier. The first game laws were
              generally received by the populace as unwarranted interferences with customary rights,
              and generally met with secret, if not flagrant, violation. But when the game became so
              scarce and the objects of the law were brought home to the people, they then saw in it
              a way by which the game might, in the interest of the community, be preserved for
              future years. It goes without saying that it was only then that its enforcement became
              effective.</p>
            <p>These illustrations merely emphasize the practical importance of the functional
              approach and the evolutionary point of view. When people see in government an
              instrument for their service, it will receive their continuous support. When they can
              see in its laws, regulations that are intended for their betterment and which in fact
              provide them with the means of enjoying more fully their liberties and rights, their
              enforcement becomes feasible, and they <pb id="VAC1001-217" n="205"/>lose their
              contemptuous dislike for law. This makes for a sentiment of law and order, conceived
              only as an indispensable means toward the accomplishment of worthy ends, and supported
              by the forces of enlightened self-interest and the hopes of altruistic endeavor, which
              are the only conceptions of law and order that can endure.</p>
            <p>Having shown the absolute necessity of city government as a means of meeting the
              pressing problems peculiar to city life, the time has now come to take up the forms of
              the government itself. This should always be preceded by a series of problems dealing
              with the origin and history of the present forms as they are found. In trying to
              account for the forms of government found in American cities, some very valuable
              experiences may be gained, and some very ingenious work in problem solving may be
              done. The history of the development of city government in America, while not very
              gratifying, is at least exceedingly instructive. Without attempting to trace in detail
              the development of city government in the United States, there are some outstanding
              features that need suggesting. In the first place the growth of cities in the United
              States has been so tremendous, and the new problems created thereby have come with
              such bewildering complexity and rapidity, that it was a task of gigantic proportions.
              Added to this are the additional factors that at the time of the beginning of the
              growth of American cities, there also occurred the popular movement against suffrage
              qualifications, and this, moreover, was followed by great increases in the tide of
              immigration.</p>
            <p>With the new cities springing up overnight and bringing with them problems that were
              new and varied; with the bars of suffrage being lowered until, in many states, it was
              not even required that one should be a fully naturalized citizen before he be allowed
              to vote; and with swarms of foreigners seeking our shores, receiving prematurely the
                <pb id="VAC1001-218" n="206"/>right of suffrage; with the corrupting influences that
              appeared with the development of public utilities, special franchises, and fabulous
              public contracts, it does not seem strange that the burdens cast upon our earlier
              forms of municipal government should have proved to be heavier than we could bear.</p>
            <p>With the beginning of municipal government, the early statesmen, realizing that the
              older forms inherited largely from England were no longer suited to the new class of
              problems, nevertheless made the fatal error of assuming that the form of government
              that had been so conspicuously successful in the federal government, and which had
              been copied in the state governments with more or less success, would be suited to the
              problems of the city. They began at the wrong end of the problem. Instead of analyzing
              their problem and then building machinery of government that would be suited to it,
              they asked themselves what kind of government they thought they liked, and tried to
              force municipal problems to fit the machinery thus established. The principle of
              separation of powers, which may be highly important in a sovereign government, but
              which can have no possible value in a municipal organization, was nevertheless
              established and has been retained tenaciously until the beginning of the present
              century. Some structural changes were made from time to time, but none of them was
              fundamental nor went to the bottom of the problem of what kind of organization the
              solution of municipal problems really required. Occasional outbursts of public wrath
              directed against obnoxious personalities in municipal politics, occurred from time to
              time, but without any great permanent effect upon the problems of city government.</p>
            <p>In connection with this history of municipal government that should be supplied by
              the teacher, there should be set the problem of accounting for the consistent failure
              of the <pb id="VAC1001-219" n="207"/>forms of government established, and with that
              problem the question of accounting for the creation of the commission form of
              government. The commission form of government was a revolution in the history of
              American cities, not because this represented the last word in city government, but
              because it marked the abandonment of the theory of separation of powers, and an effort
              to find some form of city government that was really adapted to the needs of the
              modern city. Where was the first city government by commission established? What were
              the conditions that led to its creation? What were the reasons for this sudden
              departure from the principle of separation of powers that had been observed for almost
              a century? The answer to these problems will bring out the tragic events in Galveston,
              Texas, in 1900, the breakdown of the regular government under the stress of the flood
              and the conditions that followed, and the effort to create a government that would be
              effective and get things done. We are then ready for the questions as to why the
              system was so widely adopted as it was? What were its elements of strength? In what
              ways was it superior to the older forms that it supplanted?</p>
            <p>These questions will develop the fact that so many of the modern problems of the city
              are more businesslike than they are governmental in their nature, that a form of
              organization more nearly adapted to the needs of business administration would be
              better. Has this form been supplanted? What are the latest developments in city
              government? What is the business manager form of city government? How does it differ
              from the commission plan? How has it succeeded? Why did not the earlier forms of city
              government succeed? These and other problems will stimulate the student along lines of
              thought that will have a distinct value. The purpose here is, not to introduce a
              technical discussion of the relative merits of the modern <pb id="VAC1001-220" n="208"
              />forms of city government, which would be too advanced for ordinary work in the
              public schools, but to bring out the fundamental principle that the failure of the old
              forms was due to the fact that they were not consciously adopted as means to the
              achievement of definite ends, the solution of existing problems. On the other hand, in
              so far as the modern forms have succeeded, it has been because the problem was
              scientifically approached, and a form of government adopted that seemed suited to the
              ends in view. When the public once gets the vision that city government is a means to
              an end, and they set themselves to the task of building machinery that will afford an
              effective means, success has been marked and rapid.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the other fundamental lesson of democracy must not be ignored. With the
              development of the new ideas of government, there has developed with it an increasing
              interest in government and a pleasing growth of civic spirit. Without that spirit the
              new vision and attitude toward municipal government would not have come, and without
              the civic awakening the visions would have been impotent and sterile. The
              interrelationships of the moral and intellectual requirements of effective citizenship
              and dynamic Americanism ought never to be ignored.</p>
            <p>We come now to the study of city government through the consideration of the
              functions that it performs. While the subject of city government in general may be
              taken up through the functional approach with the higher grade pupils, the best
              results are generally obtained by a study of the city in which the school is located.
              If it is desired to give some attention to the general subject of city life and
              government, this can best be done after the study of the local city, and by way of
              comparison. The important thing is to begin within the range of the pupil's experience
              and interest, and by the process of his unfolding knowledge <pb id="VAC1001-221"
                n="209"/>and widening experience, bring him to an understanding of the forms and
              mechanics of government that have been adopted to perform the functions, with which he
              is made personally familiar. By this method, government becomes a vital reality,
              clothed with human interest, and expressed in terms of the pupil's experience. This
              seems to me to be the very essence of education.</p>
            <p>Obviously, the public health is one of the most important functions of the city and
              the one with which we might naturally begin. In the discussion of the preceding
              chapter on Rural Life and Government, much was said about the health of the community,
              and how its importance might be very graphically brought home to the child. If there
              are such possibilities in rural government, think of how tremendously they are
              increased in city government, with its problems of congestion, and the correspondingly
              increased risks from epidemics and communicable disease. As already indicated, in
              rural communities such matters as the garbage, sewerage and water supply may be left
              with reasonable safety to private initiative, but that is not true in the life of a
              city. An infected water supply may involve the health of the whole city and involve a
              tremendous loss of life. Mr. Godfrey, in his informing book on city health, cites a
              dramatic example that will bring home the importance of the municipal control of water
              supply in a way that can not be soon forgotten.</p>
            <q rend="blockquote"><p>"In April, 1885, the town of Plymouth, Pennsylvania, contained
                eight thousand men, women and children. The general health was excellent, and the
                water supply from a clear mountain spring far above the town seemed unusually good.
                Like a whirlwind came the plague. Out of that eight thousand, eleven hundred and
                four contracted typhoid fever, and one hundred and fourteen died. Rich and poor
                alike were taken, and through every part of the town, highlands <pb id="VAC1001-222"
                  n="210"/>as well as lowlands, the fever raged. And this terror came from a single
                case of typhoid brought back from a great city whose polluted waters caused the
                fever. This case existed in one of the only two houses that could contaminate the
                water system. From this source came the decimation of the little town far
                below."</p></q>
            <p>To-day the efficient city protects the public health, not only by fighting the spread
              of communicable disease, by free dispensaries, by the abatement of nuisances, and the
              establishment of free hospitals, for the care of the poor, but has advanced beyond
              these remedies and is concerned with the prevention as well as the cure of disease.
              Doctor Lederle, health commissioner of New York, has declared: "Every advance in
              sanitary science goes to strengthen the position that the problems of preventable
              disease and misery are largely social problems and must be met and solved by
              collective action on the part of the community." What some of our great cities have
              been able to accomplish in their struggle against preventable disease is illustrated
              by the records of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Boston. New York has reduced the
              death rate per thousand from twenty-seven in 1881 to seventeen in 1909. Chicago has
              reduced the rate from twenty-one to fourteen during the same period. The Philadelphia
              rate has fallen from twenty-two to seventeen, while that of Boston has gone down from
              twenty-four to eighteen. This record of the city's triumph over death is most
              encouraging, and brings home in a most amazing way the vital relation of city
              government to the interest of every child. And yet New York, which leads the country
              in its generous support of health measures, devotes less than two per cent. of its
              annual appropriations to this important work, as compared with five per cent. for fire
              protection, nine per cent. for police, and seventeen per cent. for education. What
              marvelous opportunities will open <pb id="VAC1001-223" n="211"/>to the city with the
              vision and courage to devote a considerable portion of its revenue to the fight
              against disease? What untold amount of human suffering and heartaches could be
              prevented; what pitiful examples of desolation, poverty and discouragement could be
              avoided; what a contribution to the happiness and well-being of the community could be
              achieved by such a program of municipal accomplishment?</p>
            <p>The vital significance of municipal efficiency is demonstrated by the comparative
              statistics of Cleveland and Cincinnati. These two cities have enjoyed the reputation
              of being among the best and the worst governed cities of the United States
              respectively. The average annual death rate of Cleveland from 1901 to 1905 was 15.5
              while that of Cincinnati for the same period was 19.3. In other words the failure of
              the people of Cincinnati to secure as efficient government as that enjoyed by
              Cleveland caused the death of four persons each year in every one thousand of
              population, or the death of twenty persons in every thousand of population during the
              period mentioned. This would mean that during that time, two people out of every
              hundred paid with their lives the penalty of inefficient government. Surely the
              possibilities of what municipal authorities may accomplish in the saving of life and
              health affords an adequate appeal to the best there is in the boy and girl. They are
              now ready to take up the study of the departments of their own city that are vested
              with the duty to protect the health. It is certainly not claiming too much for this
              method, to assert that they will now approach it with a sense of seriousness and
              interest, and with the comprehension that they are dealing with an institution that
              writes its history of achievement or failure in terms of life and death. To suppose
              that they will not develop a more wholesome interest in their local government when
              thus studied, and a <pb id="VAC1001-224" n="212"/>corresponding increase in their
              sense of personal accountability, seems to me to be a slander upon the nature of the
              average boy and girl.</p>
            <p>A number of years ago a ship became disabled in a great storm on Lake Michigan, just
              off Jackson Park, situated on the south side of Chicago. All men aboard had perished
              or been saved, but one, who could be seen clinging to the rigging of the disabled
              ship. Life-saving crews made effort after effort to reach the craft which seemed
              unable much longer to withstand the gale. Hundreds and then thousands of people
              gathered along the shore in the cold and wind and rain, watching the pathetic figure
              clinging to the ship. They seem rooted to the spot, unable to turn away. What was that
              subtle but resistless force that held them thus enthralled? It was a deep and
              fundamental interest in the struggle to save a human life. In every local government
              in the land to-day, forces of progress are waging a never-ending battle to salvage
              human life. The struggle is not so dramatic in its setting, but infinitely more
              dramatic in its importance, because of the larger number of persons that is involved.
              Our task, then, is to bring to the knowledge and experience of the pupil a vivid
              understanding of the true significance of the proper functions of city government, in
              order that he may see in the conflict for better government the gripping drama
              presented by the struggle over human life.</p>
            <p>Another function that should be considered is that of providing municipal recreation.
              This is not merely a question of pleasure but one of health, morals and decency. The
              need of recreation and the evils of failure to provide for it are convincingly stated
              by Professor Beard.</p>
            <q rend="blockquote"><p>"It is not only the children who suffer under the industrial
                revolution. The adults need recreation just as much, and commerce has seized upon
                this need in a thousand forms. <pb id="VAC1001-225" n="213"/>Just consider for a
                moment the position of the typical family in the great city: those who are old
                enough to work, often including the mother, and children, are at the factory from
                eight to twelve hours a day, laboring at machines which require intense application,
                and continuous nervous tension. The home is a cramped tenement, or a small wooden
                house on a dull gray street and with a miserable apology for a back yard. These
                conditions produce a passion for relaxation&mdash;what John Collier calls 'an
                emotional rebound which makes a desire for pleasure which is almost hysterical.' The
                flashy 'white city,' the sensational moving-picture show, the 'unlimited'
                dance-hall, the saloon, the yellow press&mdash;these are the inevitable commercial
                responses to this desire for relief from the intense monotony of urban industry and
                life."</p></q>
            <p>In a report to the National Education Association, Mr. Hetherington, in speaking of
              the relation of recreation to crime said that "after having studied for two years the
              careers of 480 inmates of a juvenile reformatory, personal data indicated that
              seventy-five per cent. to eighty per cent. might have been saved an institutional
              career had they had normal play experience. Social workers agree that the 'bad boy' is
              largely the product of restricted or misdirected play energies. Juvenile delinquency
              diminishes in districts where playgrounds are established."</p>
            <p>Nor must it be supposed that this is a subject of interest only to the larger cities,
              for there is not a small city in the land where children would not be better off
              physically, morally and socially if their spare hours could be filled with supervised
              recreation, where they could learn the ideals of the "square deal," the necessity of
              team work, the joy of full and wholesome living. Space does not permit my going into
              the many other important functions of the city, but these two classes should suffice
              to illustrate the principle I have in mind. It is through the functions that city
              government becomes human and real. By tracing back the <pb id="VAC1001-226" n="214"
              />functions to the machinery that fulfills them, interest is fastened upon the
              government as the necessary agency for the accomplishment of the thing desired. And
              back of the agency lies the people, whose privilege and duty it becomes to see that
              these agencies perform their functions, and that the interests of justice and humanity
              shall prevail.</p>
            <p>If the limitations of time are such that the subject of city life and government can
              not be adequately treated as here suggested, the introductory part dealing with the
              history of municipal government should be the part omitted, in order that full time
              may be allowed for the functional approach. It is here that one is surest of making an
              effective appeal. It is here that the child's interest can be enlisted, and it is here
              that the virile, instinctive response must be secured. It is the study of his own city
              and its vital problems that brings to him the definite challenge of a larger, nobler
              citizenship. Then if time remains, the general aspects of municipal government and the
              problems that they raise may be profitably considered.</p>
            <p>But as with rural government, so it is with city government. There are many problems
              of fundamental importance that are left to individual initiative, and for the solution
              of which individuals must voluntarily contrive. Training for citizenship must include
              an understanding of the importance of these voluntary institutions, and an eagerness
              to participate fully and effectively in all the organized life of the community. What
              has been said in the chapter on Rural Life and Government regarding the church, the Y.
              M. C. A., the civic center, and the various improvement organizations applies with
              equal force to the city. Some of the most notable achievements in the realm of
              municipal government have been initiated and worked out through the instrumentality of
              such organizations, while others have been equally <pb id="VAC1001-227" n="215"
              />efficacious in aiding citizens to perform their civic duties with greater accuracy
              and efficiency.</p>
            <p>The work done by many local historical associations in stimulating interest in the
              community and its history has accomplished much, and teachers frequently can secure
              from such organizations cooperation that will prove both stimulating and helpful.
              Civic art leagues, especially in smaller cities, have accomplished much in spreading
              the idea of the city beautiful, in inaugurating "clean up" weeks, and in securing the
              cooperation of the schools in the practical work of making their own city more
              beautiful, healthful and attractive. The Red Cross, representing the organized
              sympathy of the community, in its splendid mission of mercy, affords a most
              stimulating example of what tremendous results can be secured by voluntary,
              cooperative effort. The various charitable organizations, the chamber of commerce, the
              parent-teachers' organizations, and similar activities should receive consideration,
              and where possible, should secure the cooperation of the school.</p>
            <p>It is frequently desirable to have the representatives of the various local
              organizations appear before the class and explain the work in which they are engaged,
              and permit the pupils to ask questions and to become intimately acquainted with the
              ideals and personalities of those in charge. In the study of voluntary organizations,
              as well as in the study of government, the functional approach should always be
              employed.</p>
            <p>One aspect of civic training in this connection remains to be noted and that is what
              is generally called "civics in action." It is the utilization of the students and
              their equipment in the public school, for definite community service. "Clean up" weeks
              inaugurated and carried out by school children are very common examples. During the
              threatened <pb id="VAC1001-228" n="216"/>food shortage at the beginning of the war,
              when every effort was being made to get those who could to raise their own foods as
              far as possible, the school children in many cities were systematically organized and
              put in charge of gardens. One of the most extensive and successful experiments along
              this line was carried out at Two Rivers, Wisconsin, several years ago, under the
              supervision of W. J. Hamilton, at that time city school superintendent, and who at the
              same time acted in the capacity of civic secretary for the community.</p>
            <p>The discussion of pending public problems was always carried on in connection with
              the debating, literary and civics work of the school. When essays of unusual merit
              were written, dealing with local problems, the local press carried them in the daily
              paper. Many of the improvements there adopted, generally not to be found in a city of
              that size, such as public parks, bathing beaches, and extensive street improvements,
              were initiated by the discussions in the public school. If the public became
              interested, then a public meeting was held in the school where the matter would be
              discussed and, perhaps, experts invited to give special information.</p>
            <p>The city health department was located in the high school, and the class in chemistry
              assisted in milk inspection and the other functions entrusted to that department. The
              closest kind of cooperation was established and maintained with the seven important
              voluntary organizations of the city. In some of these organizations, much of the work
              was performed by the children, where it could be correlated with their daily tasks.
              The record of constructive public achievement left behind is a profound testimony to
              the possibilities of "civics in action" as a working concept. But, doubtless, more
              important still is the effect upon the character and training of the pupil. He was
              here learning <pb id="VAC1001-229" n="217"/>something of the thrill that comes from
              public service and from the devotion of his talents to the public weal.</p>
            <p>Perhaps no single organization is of more importance to the direct efficiency of
              government than such civic organizations as the Municipal Voters' League, a very
              excellent example of which is found in the city of Chicago. It is the function of this
              organization to gather together all the information possible regarding the
              qualifications, experience, training, and probable efficiency of the various
              candidates for city council. Frequently there are candidates for city office with whom
              the voter has no acquaintance. Most citizens regard themselves as too busy to take the
              amount of time required to make a careful examination of the various candidates, and
              in some cases it would require a great deal of effort and exertion. Therefore, a
              voluntary organization that can get the confidence of the public, and that will give
              this information to the voter, is performing an almost necessary function. But such
              organizations become possible only to the extent that there are men of vision,
              patriotism and leadership, who voluntarily respond to these calls of human need. To
              point out the opportunities, to train the pupil to comprehend and appreciate these
              needs, and to develop a dynamic patriotism that will force them to respond, is the
              mission of the teacher.</p>
            <p>The study of municipal life and government affords rare opportunities for this
              tremendous task. Its problems appear in dramatic setting. They touch human interest
              and instinctive life at a thousand different points. They afford innumerable
              challenges to the instinct of curiosity. Here civics in action has infinite
              possibilities. To the student of city life, dynamic Americanism means more than a mere
              generous emotion; it means a program of definite tasks and a plan of concrete
              individual accomplishment, motivated by the resistless appeal to instincts and
              emotion.</p>

            <head rend="center sc">FUNCTIONS AND GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE</head>
            <p><hi rend="b">O</hi>NE of the most frequent complaints coming from teachers of civics
              is that they have been unable to interest their classes in the study of state
              government. So great has been this difficulty that it has not been uncommon to see a
              class in civics which has entirely omitted this important and fascinating subject.
              These same teachers frequently succeed splendidly with the federal and local
              governments. The former they find affords more spectacular events of interest, and the
              latter seems to come more within the understanding of youth. State government appeals
              to youth as neither spectacular nor intimate. When one considers the tremendous
              importance of the matters entrusted to the states, the importance of the problem here
              suggested will scarcely be denied. The conservation of human life in the struggle
              against industrial disease and accident, the conservation of natural resources, the
              creation and development of educational facilities, the development of general
              policies in the interest of public health and pure food and drugs, the prevention of
              child labor, the protection of domestic peace and order, and the creation of adequate
              machinery for local government, are but a few of the important duties devolving upon
              the state.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the very difficulty encountered is due to a failure to appreciate its
              fundamental significance. It scarcely seems possible that any one who realized the
              great importance of the tremendous functions entrusted to the state, would find any
              difficulty in making the study of that subject one of <pb id="VAC1001-233" n="221"
              />absorbing interest. Herein lies the difficulty. The teachers who seem to have the
              most difficulty are generally those who see in the study of the state, not an analysis
              of its functions, but a description of its framework. To them it is not a vital
              creation with human functions to perform, but a dry and uninteresting legal skeleton.
              In the federal government with its spectacular presidential elections and its duties
              of national defense, they find matters of vital interest and appeal. In the local
              governments, with their obviously intimate connection with the lives of all, they are
              able to awaken some interest and response.</p>
            <p>I have no desire whatever to detract from the importance and opportunities of local
              government. I hope they will continue to be, to every teacher, increasing sources of
              invaluable material. But it should be remembered that just one of the functions of
              state government is the provision and creation of the machinery of local government
              and the assignment to it of its functions. A local government can do nothing without
              the authority of the state, and it has no means except those so provided. It is true,
              that in response to the demand for more home rule for cities, some of these functions
              are being delegated in a few states to the people of the community, but it is still
              within the power of the state to withhold or grant these powers, and to fix the
              conditions upon which they may be enjoyed. Moreover, some of the most important and
              vital functions of local government consist in the enforcement of the laws enacted by
              the commonwealth. Much of the capacity of the local government to serve the people of
              the community, therefore, depends on the wisdom and efficiency of the lawmaking
              department of the state.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in the solution of the fundamental problems underlying the conflict between
              capital and labor, with its strikes and lockouts, and its lawlessness and brutality,
              the <pb id="VAC1001-234" n="222"/>commonwealth is concerned with problems of the most
              dramatic possibilities. In the fight against industrial disease, with all its horrors
              and its desolation, and with its infinite possibilities of ameliorating human
              suffering in its most horrible and pathetic forms, there is a challenge to red-blooded
              Americanism that can not be ignored. In the conflict with industrial monopoly, where
              the stake is the protection of the poor against the pitiless exaction of selfish and
              arbitrary power, there is an appeal to the nobler instincts that can not be excelled.
              These are but a few of the possibilities afforded by the study of the functions and
              government of the state.</p>
            <p>However, in utilizing the functional approach, a word of caution may be wise. It has
              not infrequently happened that one has become so enamored with the dramatic
              possibilities of governmental functions, that one is tempted to ignore entirely the
              framework and machinery of government. No worse mistake in the training of
              constructive patriotism could be imagined. The appeal to the instincts and their
              accompanying emotions is not done as an end in itself. No class in civics or
              Americanism should seek to occupy the place of the melodramas or the "movies." To
              arouse fine emotional thrills without translating them into a program of personal
              accomplishment for the public weal, is nothing more than taking one's class out on an
              emotional spree. To set before them the inspiring spectacle of a great commonwealth
              fighting against the forces of greed and power, thus arousing the latent forces of
              patriotic fervor, without directing them along a definite pathway of concrete
              achievement, is one of the worst forms of a spiritual debauch.</p>
            <p>Unless the functions are traced back to the machinery that is charged with their
              performance; unless the dynamic forces aroused within the child are brought to
              function upon the appropriate department as the only means of <pb id="VAC1001-235"
                n="223"/>definite accomplishment; unless the righteous anger and indignation that
              pour forth from time to time, in a splendid stream of resistless power, are directed
              against the men and departments who have failed, the whole idea of dynamic Americanism
              becomes a hollow mockery. The machinery of government and the men who are in charge,
              must stand out clear and vivid, in the light of the tremendous functions that they
              perform. Unless this is done the child can not learn to apply the doctrine of strict
              accountability to the men in power. He may burn with the fires of patriotic desire,
              but unless he knows the necessary machinery or organization through which the desire
              may be achieved, he is impotent and helpless. To arouse the glorious ardor and
              enthusiasm of youth, without directing it into the channels of definite and concrete
              service, is a wanton and a wicked waste.</p>
            <p>There must, therefore, be a vital and real connection between the functions of
              government and the machinery entrusted with their performance. The student must learn
              to think of one in the terms of the other. If he finds that vital considerations of
              public health have been ignored, he should not only be trained so that he will see, in
              his imagination, the human suffering that will result, but also so that the emotional
              force aroused by such a vision will instinctively be directed against the department
              and men who are concerned. To make our youth susceptible to great emotional response,
              without training its habitual expression into effective civic achievement, amounts to
              naught. Americanism that does not lead to a sustained and vital effort toward the
              concrete realization of its ideals, is neither practical nor worthy.</p>
            <p>At the very outset of this program there are difficulties that we must face. The
              objection will be raised that if matters of current and vital interest are discussed,
              some of <pb id="VAC1001-236" n="224"/>them will have political implications of a
              partisan character, and immediately the teacher is in trouble with some irate patron.
              It is useless to dodge the difficulty for it is there. A little consideration,
              however, may help to show that it is more apparent than real. There can be no doubt
              that if the teacher ventures upon issues over which political parties are contending,
              trouble is likely to ensue. It is equally clear that if a teacher leads in an attack
              upon some public official, because the teacher honestly and sincerely believes him
              unworthy of public office, an unpleasant situation may arise. It may also be admitted
              that if the teacher becomes a champion of any of the proposed political reforms, which
              may not be partisan issues at the time, he may find himself castigated as a
              "socialist" by irate patrons who are as reactionary as they are stupid, and who call
              all things "socialistic" with which they do not personally agree, or which they can
              not understand.</p>
            <p>These are real difficulties that may become serious and that no thoughtful teacher
              will ignore. There are two suggestions, therefore, that it is hoped will help very
              materially in the solution of the problem. In the first place let the teachers
              remember that they are not employed to teach their hobbies, to defend particular
              dogmas, or to carry on any kind of propaganda, however important may be the cause, or
              sincere its advocate. Whenever these things are done, criticism will follow, and in my
              judgment it ought to follow. The purpose of the school and the teacher is the
              education and training of the boy and girl, and not the promulgation of disputed
              doctrines. The teacher is not there to do the thinking for the pupils, but to help the
              pupils to think. He is not there to control their conclusions but to help them find
              conclusions that are honest and intelligent, the product of evidence and of thought.
              The province of <pb id="VAC1001-237" n="225"/>the teacher is not to dogmatize but to
              stimulate; not to control thought but to develop it.</p>
            <p>If the teacher will stick to the problem method and leave the students to discover
              their own theories, he will be a much better teacher, and will be occupying safer
              ground. Some months ago a case came to my attention that affords an excellent
              illustration. A teacher of civics in an Indiana high school was brought up before the
              school board for teaching socialistic doctrine in the class room. He asked for an
              investigation of his teaching. It is true that socialistic conceptions came up for
              discussion from time to time, because there were some boys from socialistic homes in
              the class. When such matters came up he pursued his usual policies of suggesting
              pertinent questions and problems, and then left them to the class for discussion and
              investigation. One critic asked him if he permitted socialistic questions, and he
              responded that he could not help it. He was there to stimulate and not to repress.
              Surely the school board would not want a boy to be denied the discussion of his
              problems in the class, if they were pertinent. How else could the boy get the views of
              others, learn to think for himself, to see the weakness of the socialism he had
              learned at home, and be prepared for the problems of life?</p>
            <p>The question had come up over a discussion of the municipal ownership of a particular
              public utility, and certain boys had come to the conclusion that municipal ownership
              was right, and had startled their parents by so announcing their conclusions. But the
              teacher, being a good teacher, was able honestly to assure them that he had never
              expressed his opinion upon the subject, one way or another. All that he had sought to
              do was to encourage the class to study and investigate the problem, which at that time
              was before the people of the city for practical determination. Did the <pb
                id="VAC1001-238" n="226"/>school board think it unwise to permit the students to
              study public problems of the community? Was it the desire of the school board that the
              teacher take a certain position, satisfactory to the school board, and compel the
              students to accept that position? If not, then what more could the teacher do, to
              avoid teaching heresy, than he had done, <hi rend="i">viz</hi>., confine his activity
              to stimulating the pupils to study and discuss, only insisting that they use honest
              and efficient methods? Perhaps the school board was not satisfied with the results of
              its investigation, but it was placed in a position where it was necessary to appear
              satisfied. The position of the teacher was impregnable. Perhaps it is interesting to
              note that when the investigation was pending, the members of his class, without the
              suggestion from any one on the outside, unanimously signed a petition asking the
              school board to retain the teacher.</p>
            <p>The other suggestion, one of far less importance, is that if there are subjects upon
              which local feeling is so high that it may be unwise to deal with them, even by the
              problem method, there are always plenty of other functional matters, which at any one
              time are not matters of such popular concern, to which the teacher can safely resort.
              No live teacher need ever be in want of ample materials that are both safe and
              effective.</p>
            <p>One other matter should perhaps be noted in this connection. The employment of either
              of the suggestions given, must not be considered as an evidence of weakening or want
              of moral force. Unfortunately, there are those who confuse bigotry with determination,
              and impudent recklessness with daring courage. There are those who prefer to propagate
              their own illusions rather than teach their students to think. With monstrous conceit,
              they conceive of their own theories as the great eternal verities of life. They prefer
              to implant these notions in the youthful mind, instead of developing <pb
                id="VAC1001-239" n="227"/>a growing thirst for truth. When such a teacher receives
              the stern rebuke that he so justly earns, he seeks relief in the vagaries of
              self-heroics, and an alibi in the appeal to academic freedom. Nor do I wish to
              belittle the fundamental importance of the principle of academic freedom. It is one of
              the very bulwarks upon which a free democracy must be founded. But the time has come
              to deny it as a refuge to those who have been its worst abusers. It must not become an
              alibi for intolerable conceit and bigotry. Its true disciples will find it not only
              necessary as a safeguard of political liberty, but an invaluable adjunct to successful
              and inspiring teaching. It is in the problem method of approach, sincerely and
              honestly conducted, that the real spirit of academic freedom reaches its fullest
              fruitage.</p>
            <p>Coming to the consideration of the functions and government of the state, again we
              should begin with the question, "Why?" In the chapter on The Functional Approach, the
              inadequacy of local government and the consequent necessity of a larger governmental
              unit was pointed out, probably, with sufficient fulness. This point should be made
              very clear and obvious to the child, before taking up a detailed consideration of the
              different functions. The line of development, begun with the consideration of the
              necessity of the family, together with its rules, organization, and authority, as an
              indispensable means of social progress, should be carried out through the local
              government, the state government and to the national organization. If this is done,
              there follows by the most natural methods, a growing consciousness of the whole fabric
              of our national life. To a student so trained, our government never will appear as a
              weird fantastic group of legal technicalities, but as a necessary and evolving
              organism, indispensable to our national existence. Such a student will approach the
              problems of government with the true evolutionary point of view, and free from <pb
                id="VAC1001-240" n="228"/>the evils of the static mind. His test of political
              efficiency will not be in the application of inherited dogmatic tests, but the
              standard of efficient service to the national ideals.</p>
            <p>Perhaps one of the most fascinating and important functions of the state is its
              program for the conservation of human life. This involves the fight against
              preventable disease, industrial disease and accidents, child labor, and the
              constructive programs for safeguarding the health of infants. Here is a group of
              functions that are of tremendous importance to the state, that make an immediate
              appeal to every one who will give them but a moment's impartial consideration. The
              reason progress has been slow is that most people have failed to realize that in the
              control of their state government these important issues were at stake. It seems
              incredible that the general lassitude and indifference frequently prevailing at state
              elections could be based upon any other ground than an utterly inadequate conception
              of the tremendous issues that always are at stake. To develop the habit of associating
              with every state election the important functions involved, is, then, one of the
              objects that we must keep in mind.</p>
            <p>Consider, for a moment, the work of preventing industrial disease and accidents. No
              civilized country in the world renders up such an awful annual toll of human life, and
              yet we are told that half of it can be prevented. By proper inspection, the
              installation of preventative devices, the adoption of adequate safeguards for
              dangerous machinery, the annual toll of accident and disease could be cut in half.
              This very important task is one of the functions of our states. Mr. A. C. Reis gives a
              striking statement of the facts and their human implications.</p>
            <q rend="blockquote"><p>"For every minute of every day of every year industrial
                accidents send one working man to the hospital or to the grave. Our factories
                annually kill or cripple 225,000; our <pb id="VAC1001-241" n="229"/>railroads speed
                by and leave in their trail 94,000 workers, dead or maimed; our mines blot out the
                life or crush the limb of 12,000 more. In all, 542,000&mdash;men, women,
                children&mdash;pay their annual tribute to the machinery of American industry.</p>
              <p>"Yet industrial accidents are scarcely half of the toll of industry. Silent, gaunt,
                appalling&mdash;stands the grim spectre of industrial disease. To-night, in New York
                City, in the cellar of a white lead factory, two Italians are emptying copper pans
                filled with carbonate of lead. They bend close over the open vessels, breathing in
                the fine white particles of poisonous dust. The faces of the men are withered and
                ghastly with the pallor of disease, their eyes are sunken and dimmed with the blear
                of growing blindness; their lips are parched and blotted with lines and blotches of
                blue. These men&mdash;victims of the poison of lead&mdash;have worked before those
                pans for only two months. They came eight weeks ago&mdash;strong, sturdy immigrants
                from the orange groves of Naples. They stand there to-night&mdash;in this their
                dreamed-of land of opportunity&mdash;doomed to blindness, insanity, paralysis, the
                agonies of a slow, creeping death.</p>
              <p>"There are ten thousand white lead workers in the United States, and white lead
                manufacture is but one of over a hundred different industries in which workmen are
                menaced by the poison of lead. Lead poisoning, morever, is only one out of thirty
                industrial poisons. Arsenic palsy, sulphide madness, mercury convulsions&mdash;these
                also lurk in the factory and in the mill. Tuberculosis claims 70,000 toilers every
                year. The potter's cough, the grinder's rot, the caisson worker's chokes&mdash;these
                all add their human toll. Three hundred and thirty thousand die each year from
                industrial disease. Unknown thousands drag on&mdash;lingering year after
                year&mdash;steeped in poverty and despair&mdash;their bodies wasting&mdash;their
                strength ebbing&mdash;waiting, hopeless, for the end.</p>
              <p>"Even this is not all of the toll of industry. The dead, the crippled, the
                diseased&mdash;these are but the wage-earners. Add to them the fatherless children
                forced to drop their play and stunt their bodies in industry; and the widowed
                mothers driven into drudgery because pinched faces wait at the table for bread; add
                the young orphan girls who may be dragged into slavery, because their home is broken
                up <pb id="VAC1001-242" n="230"/>and starvation haunts their path. To the 400,000
                dead; to the 500,000 crippled; to the unnumbered thousands racked by
                disease&mdash;to them add these millions in misery. Then you have the toll of
                industry.</p>
              <p>"The appalling and yet hopeful part of this story is that one-half of this
                suffering can be prevented. The lives of 200,000; the limbs of 250,000; the health
                and happiness of millions&mdash;this sacrifice of American industry is needless. The
                accident rate in American industry is more than twice as high as that in the
                industries of Europe. The railroads of the United States kill three times as many
                for the same number employed as do the railroads of Germany. The coal mines of the
                United States kill from two to nine times as many as do those of England, Belgium or
                France. The death rate in American mines, moreover, during the past twenty years has
                trebled, while in every nation of Europe it has been cut in half.</p>
              <p>"We need not turn to Europe to prove that one-half of the fatalities in American
                industry can be prevented. In our own Middle West, wherever a conscientious effort
                has been made, industries have checked the reckless waste. The Wisconsin Steel
                Company in 1911 reduced its accidents fifty-five per cent. over 1910. The
                Northwestern Railroad decreased its fatalities twenty-seven per cent. last year. The
                Fairbanks-Morse Manufacturing Company at Beloit, Wisconsin, has reduced its
                casualties seventy-two per cent. in six years. The Illinois Steel Company in 1902
                killed or injured 3,750 men out of every 10,000 employed. Illinois Steel in 1912
                killed or injured only 890 out of every 10,000 employed. Its death roll last year
                was one-fourth of what it had been ten years before."</p></q>
            <p>Here is a challenge to the citizenship of every state. Individuals may seek to avoid
              the blame by asserting that such matters should receive the voluntary attention of the
              private employer. But this will not suffice. Perhaps some blame may be theirs, but in
              many cases, the competitive situation makes it impossible for one man to adopt
              adequate inspection and safeguards unless his competitors do the <pb id="VAC1001-243"
                n="231"/>same. I have heard manufacturers before legislative committees pleading for
              the adoption of legal measures dealing with these evils, in order that they might
              adopt humane measures without suffering from the competition of those who did not so
              desire. Nor can one escape the facts that these evils are to great extent prevented in
              Europe and could be partly prevented in America, if we only would. Where, then, is
              that sense of American chivalry of which we like to think? Are the ideals of our
              democracy too high among the clouds to render this practical service of saving human
              limb and life? Can a nation that ignores this crying evil have a sincere devotion to
              the cause of justice and humanity? Does an Americanism that tolerates these conditions
              represent the true ideals of our democracy? So long as this continues, does not the
              mark of Cain belong on your brow and on mine?</p>
            <p>The solution of this problem is not so easy as it at first may seem. A mere spasmodic
              outburst of righteous indignation will not suffice. Laws must be carefully drawn by
              expert draftsmen who understand the manufacturing situation, and the unnecessary
              conditions that cause accidents and disease. The bill must be enacted, and its
              provisions must be enforced by inspectors who are competent, industrious and sincere.
              The only force that can produce these ultimate results is an enlightened public
              opinion, motivated by dynamic forces that can not be stilled, and directed by an
              intelligent understanding that knows when and how to act. I do not wish to minimize
              the difficulties in the way. They are real, but not insuperable. To those who will
              argue that I ask too much, I answer unless we can develop an Americanism that will
              accomplish this, democracy will fail. No government that tolerates such conditions
              permanently, can long endure.</p>
            <p>So far the appeal has been general, but it may be brought <pb id="VAC1001-244"
                n="232"/>much nearer home. There are few urban communities where some factories do
              not exist. In such communities there will likely be children who have friends or
              relatives employed in industrial enterprise. It will not take much imagination for
              them to realize that they have something deeply personal at stake. The failure to
              enact the proper law may bring sorrow and poverty to their home. The appointment of an
              incompetent factory inspector may mean the crippling of a relative or friend. By this
              way government may be made intimate; personal interest may be enlisted, and the
              generous and altruistic emotions may be aroused. It is in the marshaling and directing
              of these fundamental forces in definite assaults upon specific evils, that Americanism
              becomes worthy of its name.</p>
            <p>There is another department of state government with its attendant functions that I
              find is frequently overlooked, that we should consider here, <hi rend="i">viz</hi>.,
              the state health laboratories, found now in almost every state. In Wisconsin, for
              instance, there is a State Laboratory of Hygiene, whose function it is to make
              analysis of all kinds of matters dealing with communicable disease and its causes.
              This might very easily be omitted from a survey of the functions and departments of
              state government, but it would be a very unfortunate omission. If a local health
              board, or the school trustee, or the teacher, or some other citizen of the state,
              should fear that the source of water supply is impure, they can communicate with the
              state laboratory, and will receive promptly a container with instructions how to take
              a sample of the water and send it in to the laboratory, where it will receive a
              scientific analysis. Those who have had personal experience with epidemics of typhoid,
              can readily understand what such service may mean in terms of the life and health of
              the community.</p>
            <p>About a year ago, in a little country community, an <pb id="VAC1001-245" n="233"
              />epidemic of diphtheria broke out in the public school, seven children taking sick
              and two dying at the very start. The local authorities telegraphed for the assistance
              of the state laboratory and a competent man was sent at once. By scientific tests he
              determined at once who were the "carriers" of the disease and those who were
              susceptible, and by proper segregation and treatment they had the situation under
              control in two days, without another case or death occurring.</p>
            <p>In another small city of the state the school authorities became concerned over the
              health of the school children, and sent to the laboratory for assistance. The director
              answered the call, and under his suggestion and stimulus, the physicians of the
              community were organized and undertook the periodic medical inspection of the children
              of the public school. Many pupils were found unfit to be doing work, others in need of
              operations if they were to develop into strong men and women, others in dire need of
              glasses, and still others who were an absolute menace to the school because of
              tubercular infection. I need not dwell further upon this question, for enough has been
              said to indicate the human importance of this department. Suppose a man were placed in
              this office who had neither the ability nor the vision of the possibilities of the
              work. Hundreds of lives annually might lie in the balance, and yet it is doubtful if
              the public would protest. Not because the public is brutal, but because it is ignorant
              of the importance of the office and the method of its appointment, and is lacking in
              the imagination and emotional response needed to make effective protest.</p>
            <p>Another group of functions of vital importance over which the state has either direct
              or ultimate control, is the creation of the machinery for the administration of
              justice, and the promulgation of laws and rules for their guidance <pb
                id="VAC1001-246" n="234"/>and control. The delays and expense of justice in our
              courts present a very real and fundamental evil. It is one of the causes of popular
              disrespect for law. A due regard for justice demands immediate relief. Former
              President Taft presents one aspect of the evil in the following words:</p>
            <q rend="blockquote"><p>"There is no foundation in the attitude of the courts for the
                complaint that the courts are made for the rich, and not for the poor; for the
                judges of this country are as free as possible from prejudice of that kind. But the
                inevitable effect of the delays I have referred to is to oppress and put at a
                disadvantage the poor litigant; and while I do not mean to say that it is possible,
                humanly speaking, to put the rich and the poor on an exact equality in regard to
                litigation, it certainly is possible to reduce greatly the disadvantages to the man
                of little means, if the courts and legislatures would devote themselves to the
                elimination from the present system of those provisions which tend to prolong the
                time in which judicial controversies are disposed of.</p>
              <p>". . . . No one can examine the statistics of crime in this country and consider
                the relatively small number of prosecutions which have been successful, without
                realizing that the administration of the criminal law is a disgrace to our
                civilization. Some of the causes for the lax administration of the criminal law may
                be found in the lenient, happy-go-lucky character of the American people, absorbed
                in their own affairs and not fully realizing that this tremendous evil exists in the
                community."</p></q>
            <p>It is true that the problems involved are technical, upon which a definite public
              opinion would be impossible, but the evils are obvious, the state legislatures and the
              courts are the ones responsible, and it is possible to arouse a public opinion that
              will demand that those in power shall find a remedy for the abuse. Again the problem
              of creating adequate courts for the poor litigants, the establishment of juvenile
              courts with appropriate powers&mdash;all problems of the utmost importance to the
              public weal&mdash;are left to the <pb id="VAC1001-247" n="235"/>discretion of the
              state. This means that they are left to the people of the state, and unless we train
              the patriotic sentiment to function in the terms of these vital problems, they never
              will be solved.</p>
            <p>One of the important by-products of this method of instruction is that it will
              attract attention to the possibilities of service by the state to all its citizens.
              The railroad and utility commissions are ready to assist those who are having
              difficulties with carriers or other utilities, and who are not able financially to sue
              them in a court of law. The departments of agriculture, in many states, stand ready to
              help the farmer solve the technical problems of his business, which would otherwise go
              unsolved or involve the employment of an expensive expert. These and many other
              services the modern state supplies its citizens, and the greatest difficulty sometimes
              encountered is to get the people to utilize the services that are at hand.</p>
            <p>Approaching the problem of state government from the point of view of these and the
              many other important functions that I have been unable to describe, the total
              impression gained must necessarily be a tremendously increased appreciation of the
              importance and significance of a state government and its functions. The proper
              discharge of every one of these functions depends at one time or another upon the
              wisdom, sagacity, the patriotism and the common sense of the three great departments
              of the state government, the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. The time is
              now ripe for a consideration of the general state government as a whole. The
              functional approach to the question of separation of powers, which plays a prominent
              part in the general system of government, has been amply discussed in Chapter V. Some
              time may now profitably be given to the part that these three departments have to play
              in the discharge of the general functions of the state. <pb id="VAC1001-248" n="236"
              />Unless this is done the citizen may know that something is wrong, but he will not
              know whether to attack the legislature, or to criticize the executive. Political
              power, and a sincere desire to make its use effective, amount to nothing unless one
              knows the points of contact. Unless he can point the accusing finger at the guilty
              one, and apply political pressure at the vital point, civic righteousness must come to
              naught.</p>
            <p>Again we must meet the situation that some of the textbooks which one must use, do
              not contain the material, the usage of which is here deemed important. This may
              increase the difficulties or augment the amount of study to be done by the overworked
              teacher, but it need not necessarily defeat the employment of the method. Most books
              will probably give a very good account of state government in general, but not make
              any systematic attempt to describe or visualize its important functions. Frequently
              important details will be lacking, since the book may be written for general use and
              not for the particular state. This does not mean that the books are not usable and
              very valuable. It means merely that the teacher must supplement the contents of the
              book with his own study of the particular state, and his own descriptions of the
              functions that it performs. The important work of the various departments is generally
              outlined, and the results attained described in official reports of the various
              departments, which are usually to be had for the asking. Moreover, there is an
              undoubted advantage in this situation, for those who have the time and energy
              adequately to prepare. The teacher comes to his task with a freshness, with a personal
              interest and zest, that comes from having been in personal contact with the problem
              studied. There is an absence of artificiality and a sense of reality that is very
              contagious and effective. I understand the heavy duties that are frequently placed
              upon the <pb id="VAC1001-249" n="237"/>shoulders of the teacher, already overworked. I
              shrink from suggesting anything that means additional effort, but frankness compels me
              to say that I do not believe the average teacher can make the study of social and
              political life and institutions a real and practical success, nor can he develop the
              emotional response and the virile sentiment of dynamic Americanism, without thoroughly
              steeping himself in the life and effort of his particular community and state. I
              sincerely hope that the time is not far distant when this fact will be recognized and
              suitable provision made by the school authorities of our land.</p>
            <p>Having considered the government as a whole and from the point of view of the
              functions that it performs, we may consider the general problems of state government,
              its historic origins, and its general tendencies. Here we come to the problem method
              again, with some splendid opportunities to develop the evolutionary point of view and
              the habit of critical observation. Where did we get the general idea of state
              government that we find exemplified in most of the state constitutions? By this time,
              if the preliminary work has been effectively done, the student is on the alert for
              just such problems. He will know that back of it there must be some explanation. Did
              this particular form of government, based upon the theory of separation of powers,
              come as a result of the analysis of state problems and a conscious effort to erect a
              form of government especially adapted to their solution? When did most of the
              important problems arise? Did they arise before or after the general principles of
              state government had evolved? These questions will bring out the fact that the modern
              functions of state government came very largely as a result of the industrial
              revolution, which followed rather than preceded the form of government we still
              retain.</p>
            <p>Then how can we account for the general form now in <pb id="VAC1001-250" n="238"
              />use? What precedents were available, if any? It will not take long until some one
              has discovered that in many fundamental respects, the states are patterned largely
              after the federal government. Why should this have been done? Why did not the people
              study out the problem of state government independently of the federal government?
              Several reasons will, of course, suggest themselves. In the first place, the problems
              of the most importance that confronted the people of that day were international and
              national, rather than local. Local problems were not regarded with much interest. The
              federal government, however, for the time being, absorbed their attention. It was but
              natural, therefore, for the people, when the time came to adopt their state
              constitutions after the establishment of the federal government, to which they had
              given so much thought and attention, to pattern their constitutions largely after the
              national one. They had no peculiarly outstanding problems at that particular time to
              divert them from this natural tendency.</p>
            <p>The tracing of the antecedents of the Federal Constitution is a subject that properly
              belongs to the following chapter and will therefore not be considered here. There is
              one important difference, however, between the state and Federal Constitutions which
              should be noted. The students might well be put to the task of discovering any
              important differences between the early state constitutions and the Federal
              Constitution. Some one would discover the difference in the concentration of power in
              the president of the United States, as distinguished from the decentralization of
              executive power between several coordinate and independently elected executive
              officers of the state, over which the governor has no or little power.</p>
            <p>Why should this change have been made? Had experience demonstrated the failure of
              centralized power as <pb id="VAC1001-251" n="239"/>expressed in the Federal
              Constitution? Were there peculiar conditions in the states that seemed to demand such
              action? The inquiry would probably disclose three explanations, all of which doubtless
              had their influence. In the first place, at the time of the adoption of the Federal
              Constitution, the framers were impressed with the necessity of a concentrated
              administrative power, largely because of military reasons, and because of the dramatic
              need of strong executive power, demonstrated by the failure of the Articles of
              Confederation. When that was adopted and the immediate emergency was passed, there was
              a natural reaction from the extreme position taken in the Federal Constitution, and
              this reaction began to occur just about the time the first new constitutions were
              being formed.</p>
            <p>In the second place, there was not the military need of a centralized executive in
              the state governments, and in the third place, the election of the other officers in a
              state would be a much simpler matter in a single state than in the whole country. The
              next question is, has the change been wise? Has it produced good results? Which
              administration, on the whole, has been the more efficient, the state or the nation?
              Has this difference had anything to do with it? Some time ago a newspaper in Wisconsin
              carried the following story: A man in the northern part of the state had drawn a large
              sum of money from the bank one day and was returning to his home late at night, his
              home being located on the outskirts of the city. He discovered that he was followed by
              a suspicious-looking character and became alarmed. Finally, being convinced that the
              man was after his money, he stopped under an electric light, took the money from his
              pocket, deposited it in an envelope he found in his pocket, and then dropped the
              envelope containing the money in the mail box on the corner, and went peacefully to
              his home. The "hold-up" man could easily have broken <pb id="VAC1001-252" n="240"/>the
              mail box and secured the money had he dared. But that was a violation of federal law
              and he did not dare. Apparently, however, he would not have hesitated to have robbed
              the man at the first favorable opportunity, the man being protected only by state law.
              This is not an unusual attitude. It is a matter of common observation that many people
              will violate various state regulations of minor importance with impunity, but they
              would hesitate a long while before they would violate the postal regulations of the
              United States. Has this condition anything to do with the two methods of organizing
              the executive power?</p>
            <p>This is a question of more than academic importance since one of the reforms now
              being pressed with vigor in many states is the adoption of what is known as the short
              ballot in state government. The advocates of the short ballot point to the federal
              government, and say that its administration has been much more efficient because it
              has been centralized. They argue that it is much more popular because if all the
              administrative authority of the government is centralized in one man as it is in the
              presidency, it is much easier for the public to fix responsibility for all matters of
              administration, and to place the blame, or give the credit, as the case may be.
              Whereas, if the administrative responsibility is divided between several different
              officials, all elected, it is very easy for these men to "pass the buck" from man to
              man, and thus evade popular responsibility for their public acts. It is answered by
              the opponents of the short ballot that if it is democratic to elect one officer, it
              must be more democratic to elect them all. Moreover, if the appointing power is vested
              in one man, he will abuse it, build up a political machine and use it for personal or
              partisan purposes.</p>
            <p>It is not for the teacher to take sides in the controversy, but he can render no more
              useful service than to get the children to working on these questions, testing out the
                <pb id="VAC1001-253" n="241"/>arguments, and hunting for the evidence. This is the
              kind of work where the real power of critical analysis may be developed, and where the
              pupil must be impressed that the only test worth while is the test of service to the
              state. Practical questions, if not presented until the student is prepared for them,
              and then taken up in the critical spirit, will engage the liveliest interest of the
              student, and frequently call for the exercise of the powers of thought and critical
              analysis that might otherwise lie forever dormant.</p>
            <p>Another question should be raised in this connection. Have the changes that have
              taken place in state government been carefully studied out with special relation to
              the character of problems to be solved? In other words, have the makers of our state
              constitutions always regarded government as a means to an end? Or have they,
              occasionally, adopted certain conceptions, not because they contributed to the
              solution of specific problems, but merely because they coincided with political
              prejudice or tradition? This is a very vital problem and may be the subject of much
              profitable investigation.</p>
            <p>This thought and investigation may be directed by some of the following questions.
              What has been the character of the problems coming before the state government,
              particularly since the industrial revolution? Have they been technical problems,
              requiring expert, technical knowledge, such as health legislation, quarantine
              regulations, milk inspection tests, simplification of court procedure, methods of
              safeguarding dangerous machinery, selecting the most efficient system of sanitary
              sewage, etc., or have they been broad problems of public policy, not requiring special
              knowledge or training, but only involving facts of common knowledge and the exercise
              of common sense, such as the general question of prohibition, the issuance of bonds,
              or the passage of a soldiers' bonus law? Which group of questions presents <pb
                id="VAC1001-254" n="242"/>the most fundamental problems to the commonwealth? Do both
              require the same kind of machinery for their successful solution?</p>
            <p>In recent years there have grown up two apparently conflicting tendencies, one a
              tendency toward more direct democracy, evidenced by the movement for the initiative,
              referendum and recall, and the other toward the development of special technical
              commissions such as industrial commissions, tax commissions, railroad commissions, and
              state boards of health with vastly increased powers. These commissions are generally
              not subject to direct popular control, and have wide quasi-legislative,
              quasi-judicial, and administrative powers. In matters of legislation within their
              sphere, the legislature generally lays down merely the general policy and leaves to
              the commission the development of the technical details. Are these two movements
              inconsistent? If so, which is correct? Which seems to give the finest service? May one
              method of procedure be better in one class of cases, and the other method preferable
              in the other?</p>
            <p>In recent years there has been a very encouraging movement toward the reconstruction
              of state government. It has been contended, whether rightly or wrongly, that state
              government, on the whole, has not been well organized. It is proposed, therefore, to
              survey the whole field of the needs of state government with the idea of developing a
              framework of government that will be suited to its peculiar functions. Therefore, the
              questions we have been raising are very practical questions. Should these new
              constitutions recognize both the movement toward the more direct democracy and the
              tendency toward technical commissions? What should be the attitude of the intelligent
              citizens on these problems of the future? It is my profound conviction that <pb
                id="VAC1001-255" n="243"/>by this method of approach, the student will get a clearer
              understanding of the nature and theory of our democracy and the method of its
              organization than he can ever get in any other way. The teacher who fails to use the
              current political problems as laboratory material, with those students who have
              completed the preliminary study of the functions and purpose of government, is missing
              an opportunity to do a splendid and an interesting work. When approached in this
              patient and thoroughgoing way, the capacity of the young student to think
              intelligently upon these problems is frequently astounding.</p>
            <p>I am continually in receipt of letters from persons interested, asking me for
              suggestions on a course in "Americanism"&mdash;what it should include, and how it
              should be taught. The tenor of these letters frequently indicates that they look upon
              "Americanism" as some special subject by itself, some subdivision of civics, or some
              special aspect of our national life. As I conceive "Americanism" it is not so tangible
              or simple. I conceive it as a complex of many vital but illusive factors. It should
              represent a wealth of generous, emotional power, trained to instant response to every
              cause where justice, decency and humanity are involved; it should include an intimate
              and sympathetic outlook that can comprehend the varied factors of our national life;
              and, finally, it should include those qualities of moral and intellectual vigor that
              can fuse this emotional power, this intimate knowledge, and this point of view into a
              resistless, sustained and determined force, that can translate the ideals and the
              aspirations of American democracy into the constructive statesmanship of accomplished
              fact. In the life and character of Abraham Lincoln I think we find the embodiment of
              this ideal. The development of this complex sentiment is not easy but it is worth
              while. It is not simple, but to the <pb id="VAC1001-256" n="244"/>extent that we
              attain it, it is eminently practical. In seeking it we may not get far, but surely it
              is in the direction that we ought to go.</p>

            <head rend="center sc">FEDERAL FUNCTIONS AND GOVERNMENT</head>
            <p><hi rend="b">T</hi>HE spectacular aspects of the federal government, together with
              its functions of war and foreign policy, have given its study a zest and interest that
              most teachers have not failed to seize. With the idea of the federal government, one
              instinctively tends to identify the interesting struggles of presidential elections,
              or its more dramatic exploits of martial glory. It is in connection with the federal
              government mainly that one experiences the thrills of patriotic fervor. Its history
              leads us inevitably to the thought of war. It suggests at once the battles of Concord
              and Lexington, the heroism of Valley Forge, the gallantry of Gettysburg and
              Chickamauga, the brilliant accomplishments of San Juan and Manila Bay and the
              deathless valor of Château Thierry and Belleau Wood.</p>
            <p>No imagination is required to bring home to youthful consciousness the tragedy and
              importance of these historic struggles. The emotional response is immediate and
              profound. It is under the stimuli of such dramatic incidents that our nation's youth,
              from generation to generation, have learned the lessons of military duty. It is here
              that they have learned the glory of martial sacrifice. The patriotic and
              self-regarding sentiments have been so molded and developed, they have become so
              intimate and vital in youthful consciousness that to-day the average man prefers death
              to the disgrace and loss of self-respect that would follow a neglect of military duty.
              And this is splendid. It is necessary to the life of a nation in a war-ruled world.
              But it <pb id="VAC1001-260" n="248"/>has its tragic aspects. So self-evident and
              obvious is the call of militant patriotism, so irresistible is its appeal, so
              exhilarating and magnificent is the feeling that accompanies the response to it, that
              all other forms of patriotic effort and civic duty have been ignored.</p>
            <p>As previously suggested, our people will watch the progress of mob law in America,
              with its annual toll of brutally murdered victims, with incredible equanimity. We can
              even contemplate the failure of civil government and the temporary inauguration of
              military rule, in the course of industrial conflict, with an indifference that is
              astonishing. But like outrages in neighboring republics, if they happen to fall upon
              American citizens, will rightfully arouse the wrath of an impatient public. A citizen
              may be butchered by a lawless mob in America, and it will receive but scant attention
              in the nation's press. But let this same man cross the border and do the same act, and
              receive the same treatment at alien hands, and our entire nation will be aroused.</p>
            <p>And yet for America, with her superior advantages and her highly-developed
              institutions, to tolerate such a crime is a greater offense against humanity and
              civilization, than the similar conduct of a less fortunate and weaker neighbor. I have
              no word of apology for Mexico. I have no word of censure for those who urge that the
              influence of this great republic should be used in every <hi rend="i">proper and
                lawful way</hi> to protect our citizens against the lawlessness of others. What I
              desire to urge is that a patriotism that is directed against the evil-doing of others
              and ignores the delinquencies of ourselves; that is aroused by the violation of our
              national honor by foreigners, but is indifferent to its spoliation by those at home;
              that can sacrifice unselfishly and die nobly to protect the lives of Americans from
              alien foes, but can watch their destruction by domestic negligence with relative
              indifference&mdash;such a patriotism, noble and <pb id="VAC1001-261" n="249"
              />invaluable as it surely is, is not adequate to the needs of to-day, nor in harmony
              with the profoundest ideals and aspirations of our democracy.</p>
            <p>As I write, the nation faces a famine of most threatening proportions. The coal
              miners and the operators have been unable to agree. The miners have struck. The
              operators have offered a wage increase which it is contended will cover the increase
              in the cost of living. The miners denied the justice of the offer and refused to
              return to work. Under the terms of the Lever Act, an injunction had been issued
              against the strike, but with the formal withdrawal of the strike order, the miners did
              not return. In the meanwhile the situation has become desperate. Factories are forced
              to close and men are left without employment. Local supplies of coal are rapidly
              decreasing, and millions of poor, who buy their coal in small quantities, are not only
              facing idleness with the close of factories, but cold and cheerless homes. But a few
              weeks more of these conditions and actual famine and hunger will reap their harvest of
              death and desolation.</p>
            <p>Why must these things be? Must our government admit its impotence in the face of such
              a crisis? Is our democracy incompetent to grapple with the situation? Must the nation
              that amazed the world with its organizing genius, its resistless spirit and its
              incomparable military accomplishments against foreign foes, admit its incompetence in
              dealing with domestic problems? Doubtless, in time, the emergency will be met. Some
              way we will "muddle through," and the country will be spared the worst of the perils
              that seem now to confront us. But in the meanwhile great suffering will have occurred.
              This will be accepted with equanimity, and the country will settle down again, none
              the wiser or more efficient, for its experience.</p>
            <p>What is wrong? Why was the present situation allowed <pb id="VAC1001-262" n="250"/>to
              develop, until the crisis was upon us? Why have the government and the public been
              content with a situation that made possible, yes, inevitable, just the kind of
              struggle through which we now are passing? This goes to the very root of the problem.
              The answer is found in the public indifference to the issues that are involved, an
              indifference that does not disappear until the public begins to feel the pinch of
              want. If our citizens were equipped with a dynamic, patriotic sentiment that responds
              as quickly to the menace of domestic ills as it did to the threats of foreign foes,
              the present crisis, in its present form, never would have occurred.</p>
            <p>Such a patriotic sentiment would have demanded prompt and adequate attention and
              consideration, both to the demands of labor and the interests of capital, not merely
              in a tardy spirit of self-defense, but in a spirit of justice and fair play. Such a
              sentiment might have demanded an impartial investigation, a fair hearing, and a just
              and proper settlement, before the conflict had reached the stage of irreconcilable
              bitterness. Neither side would dare refuse a settlement so arranged. Behind it would
              be organized the resistless power of public sentiment, as virile, as dynamic and as
              overwhelming as the sentiment that organized our resources and triumphed over our
              foes. However much either side might wish to avoid the settlement, it would scarcely
              dare to defy a public sentiment so powerful and impelling.</p>
            <p>This, again, raises the question of whether such a sentiment may be developed. Are
              war and foreign affairs the only objects around which we can organize the sentiment of
              patriotism? Is it only when injustice is done by foreign foes that humanity will yield
              its most vigorous response? Is it only the heroism of war, the tragedy of battle, or
              the stimulus of martial conflict that can afford an <pb id="VAC1001-263" n="251"
              />adequate response? Perhaps the tragedies of peace, injuries by internal foes, and
              appeals for domestic justice may not produce an emotional response so effectively as
              war. We have not yet the experience upon which to base a satisfactory answer. Certain
              it is that in general it never has been done. It is equally certain that it has been
              rarely tried. The thing for which I plead is to give it a searching and thorough
              trial. Its potential importance to democracy, and its vital necessity to the strength
              and future of our nation, surely afford ample warrant for the effort.</p>
            <p>Whether or not the patriotism of peace may be made as virile and effective as the
              patriotism of war, there can be but little doubt that great and needed improvement can
              be achieved. In the brief analysis of some of the social instincts and emotions
              attempted in Chapter II, we found nothing to indicate that the tragic and human
              aspects of our domestic life would not afford the basis of an adequate appeal, if it
              were set forth in its vital naked significance. Nor does there seem to be any inherent
              reason why the efferent aspect of the instinctive organization could not be trained to
              respond in terms of civic achievement as well as in terms of military duty.</p>
            <p>The problem, then, concretely presented by the study of the federal government and
              functions, as well as by the study of all other phases of civics, is one of so
              analyzing and describing the functions of the federal government, that its deeply
              human and dramatic aspects will make a deep and profound appeal to the social
              instincts. The thrill of joy that comes from a generous response to emotional
              excitement, when aroused in a noble cause, must be brought home with a vivid sense of
              its reality. The relations between the individual and the functions of government, the
              ways and means of making his ideals and his beliefs a vital force in the performance
              of those functions, must be made <pb id="VAC1001-264" n="252"/>clear, specific and
              intelligible, in order that the emotional power may not be wasted, but become
              articulate and effective. And this requires, not only the development and training of
              a rich emotional response, in both its afferent and efferent aspects, but the
              intellectual capacity of analysis, a passionate love of truth, a keenly developed
              instinct of curiosity, and an evolutionary point of view that sees in government the
              human agencies through which the divine destinies of humanity are ultimately to be
              achieved. For the most splendid emotional life conceivable becomes impotent if not
              vicious when misdirected by ignorance, bigotry or selfishness, or when it does not
              find its ultimate expression in constructive service.</p>
            <p>With this restatement of our general problem, we are ready to try its solution in
              relation to the opportunities afforded by the federal government. The first question
              that would naturally present itself is, why have a federal government? Why were not
              the state governments sufficient? Why is not the imposition of the national government
              a useless burden, an extravagant expense, an unnecessary complication, and a very
              material interference with the independence and sovereignty of the states? These
              questions, while their answers may be obvious to the teacher, present some very real
              difficulties, and involve some very fundamental principles, with which every pupil
              should be familiar. And unless they are presented to him in this way, they may never
              be adequately comprehended. The general question of the reasons for the establishment
              of a federal government have been already dealt with, with sufficient fulness in
              previous chapters. The conception of government as a means to an end, the value of
              cooperation between states as well as between individuals, the principle of
              federalism, the idea that a state in surrendering certain important and vital rights
              may thereby obtain greater security for its <pb id="VAC1001-265" n="253"/>most
              important interests, are all fundamental ideas which can be brought home with
              vividness and conviction, when the causes for the formation of the union are carefully
              traced and their nature analyzed. And yet there are many prominent men to-day whose
              public utterances amply demonstrate a fundamental ignorance of these simple and
              elementary principles. They perhaps may be cognizant of them, but they play no part in
              their intellectual life.</p>
            <p>The understanding of these principles and this important part of our history is a
              matter of considerable practical importance. One of the obvious tendencies of the day
              is to give over more and more functions to the federal government at the cost of the
              state government. Many think this a very dangerous custom. Undoubtedly it may be
              carried too far. But how shall this question be determined? Some people, disgusted
              with the inability of the state governments to enforce the law, seek to throw the
              burden upon the more efficient federal government, rather than by trying to bring the
              state government to the same degree of efficiency. This is both unstatesmanlike and
              cowardly. Remembering that government is a means to an end, the only solution to the
              problem is to determine in each case, whether the question is by its nature more
              suitable to a single body of regulations uniform and fixed throughout the nation,
              without regard to local differences in conditions or public opinion, or whether its
              adequate treatment would necessarily depend upon conditions that differed materially
              among the several states. Obviously this question will only be intelligently met after
              a most painstaking survey of the problem, and an analysis of the material factors and
              conditions in the different states.</p>
            <p>And yet when the question comes to-day, as it does occasionally, most people and
              statesmen divide, not upon the fundamental question I have indicated, but upon the <pb
                id="VAC1001-266" n="254"/>pedantic theory that they believe in "state rights" or in
              the centralization of power. A few years ago it was suggested that all corporations
              engaged in interstate commerce be compelled to take out a federal license or a federal
              charter. In the public discussion that followed, there was very little said that had
              any possible connection with the real merits of the question, most people lining up in
              accordance with whether they inherited a prejudice for the formula of "states' rights"
              or of a strong centralized government. Thus we see again the tyranny of an established
              phrase. We see great public questions turn upon their compliance with trite unmeaning
              concepts. We see progress again sacrificed to the narrowness, the bigotry and the
              stupidity of the static mind. If our knowledge of our government and its theories had
              been obtained through the functional approach, if our understanding of the relative
              functions of the state and federal government, as worked out and developed by the
              fathers, had been secured through the careful analysis of the needs, conditions and
              functions of the two, it can not be doubted that such problems would be approached
              more in the spirit of reality than in the present attitude of prejudice and
              dogmatism.</p>
            <p>The intelligent teaching of the federal government would involve the solution of the
              problem of the division of powers between the state and federal government. This would
              require a careful analysis of the economic and political conditions that then
              prevailed, and a tracing of the methods and intellectual struggle through which the
              framers of our fundamental law sought to solve the problem for their day and
              generation. No student could go through the records of those stirring and heroic times
              without having the principles involved indelibly impressed upon his consciousness. To
              do less than this is to squander a priceless opportunity.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the student who is directed through this <pb id="VAC1001-267" n="255"
              />fascinating and wealthy field of constitutional and political history, is prepared
              to grasp the real meaning and significance of the issues of nullification and
              secession that culminated in the Civil War. The student who has traced that great
              conflict through all its phases in the constitutional convention, who has traced its
              discussion in the light of the terrible and destructive conditions prevailing under
              the Articles of Confederation, will not fail to comprehend fully the grim menace of
              secession. He will not be misled by the issue of slavery, but will understand that the
              very life of popular government was at stake.</p>
            <p>Another fundamental conception of contemporary importance, which is dramatically
              illustrated by the history of the constitutional convention, is the practical value
              and nature of cooperative undertakings in which a political body may sacrifice a
              portion of its sovereignty in order to obtain a larger degree of security. The
              sovereignty of the states was a conception that threatened the whole enterprise of the
              constitutional convention and its work. It had been this theory that made the
              government under the Articles of Confederation a dismal failure. As observed in a
              previous chapter, the final adoption of the Constitution was finally secured, not as
              an act of national altruism, but as a necessary means of security for the freedom of
              the state. The fathers were practical men. By an analysis of conditions they found
              that certain interests the states held in common. They found that the protection of
              these interests could be better provided jointly, than individually. These matters
              they delegated to the national government, retaining all others for the states. It is
              true it involved grave departures from the rights and prerogatives of the states. But
              it is equally true that in the surrender of these interests they found a peace and
              freedom that was infinitely more secure.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-268" n="256"/>
            <p>To a very large extent these are the same principles involved in the proposed league
              of nations. And yet how much of the popular discussion has been in terms of
              fundamental principles? Many of its enemies have gone but little further than to
              assert the obvious fact that the league of nations will impose some restrictions upon
              the sovereign will of the United States. A man prominent in public life, a member of
              the Senate, has declared in public address that he could never vote for "any scheme
              that would impose upon the sovereign will of America, any degree of legal restraint."
              The unfortunate thing is that similar statements have been loudly applauded in popular
              audience, and received wide editorial approval among the press. And yet nothing could
              be more misleading nor pernicious. Every principle of international law which America
              has helped to form, and which she has sought to defend in battle, imposes a legal
              restraint upon our national will. Every treaty that we have entered, every
              international engagement to which we are a party, imposes some restraints. It is one
              of the glories of our nation that we have consistently accepted these restraints as
              legitimate and binding. And the most damning evidence against the Imperial German
              Government has been her unwillingness to recognize any legal restraint upon her
              "sovereign will." The very essence of Prussianism is found in its insistence that the
              national will shall suffer no restraint. I do not mean to imply that the press and
              people who use or approve the argument suggested are guilty of Prussianism, but that
              in their thoughtlessness they have seized a phrase because it had the rhythmic cadence
              and heroics that would serve their needs, without examining its significance, or
              ascertaining its pertinency.</p>
            <p>Likewise some of the defenders of the league of nations, instead of resorting to
              constructive statesmanship, based their case upon the easy-going assumptions of a
              sentimental <pb id="VAC1001-269" n="257"/>internationalism. They simply assumed that
              all humanity was united in common interests, and that the world state or any other
              form of international organization was a necessary step in the right direction. They
              regarded nationalism as an inherent peril, no longer of legitimate value. They
              blissfully ignored the fact that intelligent nationalism might be a tremendously
              effective social force, and the very foundation upon which any international
              organization must be builded. A man's intelligent devotion to his wife and family does
              not prevent him from being a good citizen of his country. He need not be equally
              attentive and devoted to all wives in order to show the spirit of democracy, and a
              lack of narrow selfishness. In fact, the more devoted he is to his own family, the
              more he is likely to be devoted to the nation that protects it.</p>
            <p>Likewise, in order to be the broadest kind of a humanitarian with a world outlook,
              and eager to serve humanity, one need not sacrifice the dynamic forces of intelligent
              nationalism nor forget the sound maxim that "charity begins at home." The
              internationalism that lives upon a sentimental interest in all humanity, at the cost
              of one's devotion to the country where he lives, is neither practical nor ennobling.
              Any successful scheme of international organization must rest upon the enlightened
              self-interest of the nations that compose it. Its strength will depend upon the
              strength of these nations and its capacity to serve them. If these nations are not
              enjoying a wholesome, vigorous and intelligent nationalism how, then, can they provide
              the basis for a league of nations that will endure?</p>
            <p>As long as the discussion is carried on in the terms of these glittering generalities
              against impairing sovereignty or in favor of internationalism, no substantial progress
              toward the constructive solution of the problem can be secured. If we approach it as
              the best minds in the <pb id="VAC1001-270" n="258"/>constitutional convention grappled
              with it, we shall find the basis of intelligent discussion. They began with strict
              ideas of state sovereignty. But experience had taught them that the several states had
              certain interests in common; that these interests could be better served by the common
              effort, acting through an independent government that represented all; and, that,
              while the loss of state sovereignty over the specific things entrusted to the general
              government was unfortunate, it was far more than offset by the added security
              obtained. Thus the federal government was created, not in an effort to discard state
              governments, but in order the better to protect them.</p>
            <p>Applying this method of procedure to the question presented by the league of nations,
              we come to the following questions: Do the great nations of the world have certain
              interests in common? Can these interests be better served through such an
              international organization as the league of nations? Is the value of such service to
              the nation sufficient to offset the restraints upon national action that are assumed?
              It is obvious that the answer to these questions goes to the basis of the matter. That
              there are some interests we have in common with the other nations of the world, where
              the advantages of joint control obviously offset the loss of freedom of national
              action, is amply demonstrated by the adherence of America to such international
              arrangements as the Universal Postal Union, Universal Telegraph Union, the various
              Hague conventions, and the Algiciras Act. Are the matters which we propose to leave to
              the league of nations of this character? Are the new liabilities that we assume, and
              the loss of liberty of action in certain matters that we suffer, compensated for by
              the additional security and services that we secure? It is inevitable that there
              should be all degrees of opinion. Those who sincerely and intelligently advocate
              reservations do so because they <pb id="VAC1001-271" n="259"/>believe that the
              particular things they desire to reserve from the jurisdiction of the league, are
              either not such matters of common interest as could be better protected by joint
              action than by individual endeavor, or that the machinery devised is not adequate to
              the burdens assumed, or that the restraints and liabilities assumed in regard to
              certain things are greater than the expected benefits.</p>
            <p>When public discussion and investigation becomes centered upon these specific
              problems, then there is hope for genuine progress toward their ultimate solution. This
              does not mean that the great project is to be robbed of its appeal to the idealistic.
              However selfish may be the motives that bring nations together in the common effort to
              solve the great problems of the world, their efforts toward an achievement of such
              tremendous import to humanity present an ennobling and inspiring spectacle. The
              enlightened selfishness of intelligent nationalism that prompts the movement for
              greater cooperation and less destructive competition among the nations of the world,
              is one of the most beneficent influences of to-day. Its selfishness is of the same
              kind that leads intelligent men to support the cause of organized society, and that
              led the thirteen belligerent and jealous colonies to create a powerful and enduring
              nation. It is rooted in a profound conception of the realities of life and in the
              fundamental understanding that restraint is essential to cooperation, whether in the
              home, the nation, or the world, and that cooperation is indispensable to progress.</p>
            <p>If the study of the creation of the Federal Constitution can be made another
              opportunity to drive home, with resistless logic, an understanding of the real nature,
              purpose and function of government and law; if it can be made the occasion to
              re-emphasize the fact that the restraints of law are but the requisites of cooperative
              effort, and that the <pb id="VAC1001-272" n="260"/>test of such effort is to be found
              in the results actually achieved, a great step will have been taken in preparing our
              youth for the civic duties that lie ahead. If these conceptions can be illustrated by
              application to the problems of the day, they gain in reality and interest to the
              student as he gains in ability to utilize them in the practical problems that confront
              him.</p>
            <p>Coming now to the functions of the federal government, the one that most persons
              think of, is that of national defense. It is in this connection that most persons have
              had their attention drawn to the federal government, and it is in response to the call
              of the nation for purposes of defense, that patriotic sacrifice has reached its
              greatest heights. I do not want to belittle this splendid sacrifice. The generous
              ardor with which the young men of America responded to the call of arms is one of the
              most sublime spectacles that history can afford. I glory in the matchless record of
              gallantry, heroism and self-sacrifice. I glory in the proud, heroic and gigantic
              achievements of our people in the hour of need. The wave of patriotic sentiment that
              swept our country and made us one people with one purpose, and mobilized behind that
              purpose the spiritual and material resources of the land, was the most powerful,
              resistless force that America has known. And its importance to the cause of the nation
              and humanity was as great as its resistless power.</p>
            <p>This sentiment of militant patriotism we must continue to nourish and develop. The
              point I want to emphasize again and again is that such a sentiment alone is not
              enough. There has been a tendency on the part of some who have felt the inadequacy of
              such a sentiment, to question its importance and to impugn its fundamental value. Such
              a point of view will not bear critical analysis. We need all <pb id="VAC1001-273"
                n="261"/>of the militant patriotism that we can develop. Let none of it be
              sacrificed! What we do need is to supplement it with an equally virile patriotism of
              peace. What we need to do is to show that the conflicts waged by government against
              injustice, poverty, disease, accidents and ignorance, are fraught with a vital
              significance to mankind, and that questions of national honor are broader than the
              problems of diplomacy and involve the just defense of justice and decency at home as
              well as the defense of our interests abroad. The military functions of the government
              should not be ignored, therefore, but should be used to develop the sentiment of
              militant patriotism and to show the need of a similar sentiment, directed at the
              problems of peace.</p>
            <p>Closely allied to the functions of defense is the matter of foreign policy, where the
              appeal to the heroic may be almost equally effective because of its close relation to
              the problem of defense. That America is destined to play a larger part in the
              destinies of the world, no one will deny. We may regret it. We may wish to retain our
              traditional isolation, but we can not. Our commerce is found on every sea. Our
              shipping goes into every port. Every nation is to-day a competitor for the markets of
              the world. If a nation loses its fair share of commerce, its greatness will begin to
              disappear. It is, therefore, a struggle for life or death. In this mighty struggle we
              must play our part. We have declared that we have a definite interest in the "open
              door" in China. We have declared that we have a vital interest in the freedom of
              American republics from external aggression. We have acquired islands on the far side
              of the Pacific. Because of a controversy between Austria and Serbia which could not be
              peaceably adjusted, events followed which forced America into the greatest war in
              history. In the face of these facts, our talk of isolation becomes little <pb
                id="VAC1001-274" n="262"/>more than misleading and alluring fiction. To this extent
              the subject of foreign policy and diplomacy becomes a matter of just concern.</p>
            <p>But the ignorance of the American public regarding world politics and questions of
              foreign policy is proverbial. Popular audiences will declare their willingness to
              sacrifice their lives in defense of the Monroe Doctrine and yet they could neither
              accurately state its principles nor construct an argument in its defense. It becomes
              necessary, therefore, in the training of citizenship to arouse enlightened interest
              and intelligent appreciation of these important problems. Why have a foreign policy at
              all? Why have the Monroe Doctrine? Why not abandon it as some have urged? What good
              has it accomplished? These and similar problems should be set the students in order
              that their interest may be stimulated, and they can comprehend the real necessity of a
              definite policy. Perhaps a good method of approach would be the question of
              neighborhood courtesy and good manners. It is easy to see why it is wise for each
              person in a community to have a fixed habit or policy of politeness and consideration
              for his neighbors. If one's neighbor is very ill next door, one has the right to make
              all the noise he desires in his own home, as long as he does not create a nuisance,
              although it means the distress and injury of the sick. One may refuse to speak to his
              acquaintances or to return civil and kindly greetings, without violating any legal
              right. One may refuse to clean up the unsightly condition of his yard, provided it be
              not dangerous or unhealthy, even though it be an eye-sore to the whole community, and
              still be within the law. But it is very rarely that we find a person who follows such
              a policy. If he did he would be constantly developing friction and misunderstandings,
              would find people unwilling to cooperate with him, and would make himself the object
              of general hostility <pb id="VAC1001-275" n="263"/>and dislike. Most intelligent
              people, as a matter of policy and decency, exercise a reasonable regard for the
              welfare of their neighbors, although not required to do so as a matter of law.</p>
            <p>They follow this policy because it is pleasant, profitable, and avoids much
              unpleasantness and friction. They do not do anything that affects their neighbors that
              they would not want their neighbors to do. Nor do they ask any consideration of their
              neighbors that they themselves would not freely grant. In a community where most of
              the people follow this policy, everybody profits by it.</p>
            <p>These matters of policy and habit are to the community what foreign policies of the
              nations are to the civilization of the world. The latter are infinitely more
              complicated and complex, but the underlying principles are much the same. Thus we
              begin to see the answer to the question of the necessity of a foreign policy. Upon
              that will depend to a large extent the issues of war and peace, or of friendship or
              hostility, among the nations of the world. When Germany began to carry out a foreign
              policy which considered no interests but her own, she embroiled the whole world in
              war. Realizing that with such a policy she was a menace to all, many nations made
              common cause against her. It is important, therefore, that we should have a public
              opinion, based upon the clearest conviction of its righteousness and importance, which
              would demand that the foreign policy of America never should depart from the
              fundamental principles of justice and fair dealing with all the nations of the world,
              nor fail to exercise at all times a scrupulous regard for their legitimate interests
              and rights.</p>
            <p>But while these general principles are basic and must always be preserved, they are
              not enough. The interests of national defense require not only that our relations with
              other nations should be just and reasonable, that we be <pb id="VAC1001-276" n="264"
              />ready to resist an attack from foreign foes, but also that in times of peace we
              insist that nations should not so disturb the status quo in regard to established
              international boundaries or political dominions, as to constitute a menace to our
              future peace and safety, or to afford to another power some new strategic basis for a
              possible future attack against the United States. The theory of such a policy is
              expressed in the old adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In
              the interest of future safety, therefore, America should have such a policy and be
              ready to defend it.</p>
            <p>It was in compliance with such principles that the Monroe Doctrine was adopted. When
              the so-called Holy Alliance was planning to re-subject the Latin-American republics
              whose independence had been recognized by the United States, to the political dominion
              of Spain, President Monroe declared that such action would be considered as "dangerous
              to our peace and safety" and as the "manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward
              the United States." The reasons for this doctrine were obvious. The South American
              republics, because of their democratic ideals as well as their relative military
              weakness, would never menace the United States. On the other hand, to have powerful
              European empires, who had declared their hostility to democracy and freedom, become
              firmly entrenched upon neighboring soil, where they would possess the basis for a
              strategic attack against the United States, and bring to this hemisphere the
              disastrous quarrels and intrigues of European politics, would obviously jeopardize the
              peace and safety of the United States. The same reasoning justified the later
              extension of the Doctrine to include the prohibition of a foreign power gaining
              territory in the Americas, even though acquired by peaceful session.</p>
            <p>The problem may then be set of determining what <pb id="VAC1001-277" n="265"
              />protection, if any, this policy has afforded to America. This is an important
              question for students to consider, since most of the support of the Monroe Doctrine is
              not based upon an understanding of its usefulness, but merely upon feelings of
              national pride. If there had been no Monroe Doctrine, and Germany, free to colonize in
              Brazil and the Caribbean, had firmly established herself there and acquired a
              satisfactory basis for military operations against the United States, we would have
              found ourselves in a much more serious predicament as a consequence of the European
              War. Under such conditions, with the different European belligerents entrenched on
              American soil, Germany in Brazil, and France in Mexico, for instance, the outbreak in
              Europe would have instantly spread to the European colonies in this hemisphere, and
              have menaced the interests of America in a much more immediate and fundamental
              way.</p>
            <p>But does this Doctrine square with those ideals of fair dealing and good
              neighborliness which should be the basis of our international relations? It has
              frequently been denounced as an arbitrary interference with the rights of other
              nations, and therefore an unnecessary cause of international friction. No doubt other
              nations have opposed it from time to time and have sought to evade it. But are such
              nations just and reasonable in their point of view? Are they willing to grant the same
              kind of concessions that they ask? Would Germany permit us to buy Denmark and there
              erect and fortify a territory of the United States? Would Germany consent to England
              or France peacefully acquiring permanent possession of Rotterdam or Antwerp? Would the
              European powers quietly acquiesce if America were to acquire Sicily and organize it as
              part of our national domain? Would the powers of Europe consent to Germany acquiring
              Constantinople, even though it be lawfully and peacefully done? The answer is obvious
              in every case, and <pb id="VAC1001-278" n="266"/>for the same fundamental reason that
              we could not be expected to permit foreign powers to establish new dominions in the
              Americas. Any nation that would insist upon our permitting them so to do, could not be
              considered friendly to the United States. Would it not be better, therefore, to oppose
              them then, than to postpone the conflict until that power could fight from the vantage
              ground that we had allowed her to attain?</p>
            <p>Former Secretary of State Root argues convincingly in behalf of the Monroe Doctrine
              as a reasonable and intelligent measure of self-defense. "The most common exercise of
              the right of self-protection outside of a state's own territory and in time of peace
              is the interposition of objection to the occupation of territory, of points of
              strategic military or maritime advantage, or to indirect accomplishment of this effect
              by dynastic arrangement. For example, the objection of England in 1911 to the
              occupation of a naval station by Germany on the Atlantic Coast of Morocco; the
              objection of the European Powers generally to the vast force of Russia extending its
              territory to the Mediterranean; the revision of the Treaty of San Stefano by the
              Treaty of Berlin; the establishment of buffer states; the objection to the succession
              of a German prince to the throne of Spain; the many forms of the Eastern Question; the
              centuries of struggle to preserve the balance of power in Europe&mdash;all depend upon
              the very same principle which underlies the Monroe Doctrine; that is to say, upon the
              right of every sovereign state to protect itself by preventing a condition of affairs
              in which it will be too late to protect itself."</p>
            <p>From the foregoing it should be made clear to the student that the Monroe Doctrine is
              not in violation of those fundamental conceptions of fair dealing and regard for the
              rights and welfare of others, that should form the basis of our foreign relations. It
              would seem clear that any state that <pb id="VAC1001-279" n="267"/>would insist upon
              its violation must be regarded as an enemy and that it is the part of reasonable
              foresight and prudence to resist that power then and there rather than to delay until
              it may be too late.</p>
            <p>The Monroe Doctrine, thus conceived and understood as a reasonable and efficient
              means for the national defense, has been amply justified by almost a century of
              practical experience. On the other hand, improper schemes and unworthy aims have been
              only too frequently camouflaged under the protecting influence of its name. The people
              have been too willing to support any policy that invoked the authority of Monroe. In
              this condition there is obvious danger. The Monroe Doctrine has become a term with
              which the demagogue may conjure. An appeal to this basic principle always finds an
              immediate response. As long as the appeal is to the real principles of intelligent
              self-defense that underlie the Doctrine, it is a national asset of tremendous worth.
              But when the appeal is not germane to those fundamental principles, and invokes the
              policy of Monroe only to mislead the public to the support of an unworthy aim, it
              becomes an actual menace. Most of the intelligent criticism against the Doctrine has
              really been directed against its possible abuse.</p>
            <p>Former Secretary Root, while defending with great power the real principles that
              underlie the Doctrine, has made a telling plea against its occasional abuse. "A false
              conception of what the Monroe Doctrine is, of what it demands and what it justifies,
              of its scope and of its limits, has invaded the public press and affected public
              opinion within the past few years. Grandiose schemes of national expansion invoke the
              Monroe Doctrine. Interested motives to compel Central or South American countries to
              do or refrain from doing something by which individual Americans may profit invoke the
              Monroe Doctrine. Clamors for national glory <pb id="VAC1001-280" n="268"/>from minds
              too shallow to grasp at the same time a sense of national duty invoke the Monroe
              Doctrine. The intolerance which demands that control over the conduct and the opinions
              of other peoples which is the essence of tyranny invokes the Monroe Doctrine.
              Thoughtless people who see no difference between lawful right and physical power
              assume that the Monroe Doctrine is a warrant for interference in the internal affairs
              of all weaker nations in the New World. Against this supposititious doctrine many
              protests both in the United States and in South America have been made, and justly
              made. To the real Monroe Doctrine these protests have no application."</p>
            <p>Whether this great Doctrine is to be an asset or a menace, depends upon whether the
              public opinion that supports it is intelligent, alert and critical, or whether it be
              ignorant, prejudiced or intolerant. If the public view it as a means to worthy ends,
              and if they will support it only when invoked in the nation's legitimate defense, it
              will become an instrument of incalculable worth. On the other hand, the public's
              failure to grasp its real significance may lead us into difficulties, bring the
              Doctrine into disrepute, and rob us of its protecting power.</p>
            <p>To-day America stands in a critical situation. The destruction of her isolation is
              obvious and plain. Some interest in the affairs of Europe can not be denied, for it
              was an Austrian-Serbian controversy that finally involved us in a great and costly
              war. We can not foresee when another minor outbreak may precipitate a world conflict
              in which we may again be compelled to play a part. The wounds of the recent conflict
              will not quickly heal. The nations of Europe, eager to recoup themselves from the
              drain of four long years of war, will compete with renewed bitterness for the trade
              and markets of the world. They will look with increased eagerness to the resources of
              South <pb id="VAC1001-281" n="269"/>America, where the establishment of political
              dominion would afford alluring opportunities for commercial monopoly and exclusive
              privilege. A league of nations has been suggested as the means by which the nations of
              the world may jointly grapple with these mighty problems. What course shall America
              pursue? In what direction will she find her greatest security? Where can she render
              her largest usefulness? Whatever course we take must lead through untried paths and
              across uncharted seas. The very destiny of our nation is at stake. Our future will
              depend upon the courage, the intelligence, the sanity and the devotion which the
              American people bring to bear upon the solution of these portentous problems. Civic
              training that ignores these problems is therefore inadequate and incomplete.</p>
            <p>Another function of the federal government which may be profitably utilized to
              demonstrate its importance, and enlist a deep and abiding interest in its behalf, is
              the power to organize and govern the territorial possessions of the United States.
              Some of the greatest crimes against civilization have taken place in connection with
              colonial policies, and it is not uncommon to associate the possession of colonies with
              political tyranny and hostility to democracy. With the annexation of Hawaiian Islands
              in 1898, and the acquisition of Philippines and Porto Rica through the fortunes of
              war, the problems of colonization were squarely presented to the United States.
              Because of the popular apprehension against the abuses of colonization, which
              apparently many thought to be inherent in the system, there was great opposition to
              our retention of the territory and a national campaign was waged in 1900 over the
              issue of "imperialism."</p>
            <p>Something of the difficulty and importance of the problem may be gained from an
              examination of some of the figures <pb id="VAC1001-282" n="270"/>regarding the
              Philippines. In the acquisition of this territory, we came into possession of 3,141
              islands, covering 127,000 square miles of territory, and with a population of
              7,635,000, of whom 461,000 were described as wild. The destiny of these peoples was
              thus placed into our keeping. More than that, America was to be closely regarded by
              the whole world to see whether, in the control and government of colonial territory,
              we would depart from those principles of freedom and democracy which we had so
              consistently defended and espoused. Would the Philippines be exploited or developed?
              Would the government there established be primarily for our benefit or theirs? Would
              we seek to prepare the natives for self-government or for vassalage? In our own
              colonial exploits, would we be guilty of the wrongs we had so freely condemned in
              others? These questions aroused deep concern among thoughtful Americans and require
              attention now. America, in the acquisition of foreign territory, was given an
              opportunity to demonstrate her faith in the theory that governments exist for the
              service and benefit of the governed.</p>
            <p>In the colonial record that America has achieved there is ground for just and lasting
              pride. Mistakes have been made, but they have generally been mistakes of the head,
              rather than mistakes of the heart. True to our fundamental theory, that the basis of
              effective government must rest in the education of the people and their preparation
              for the tasks of life, one of our first concerns in the Philippines was the
              development of a system of popular education, in which industrial training received
              much attention. In 1912 there were 3,364 primary, 283 intermediate, and 38 secondary
              public schools, with an average monthly enrollment of 395,075 pupils.</p>
            <p>In addition to this educational program, equally comprehensive plans were inaugurated
              for the protection of the <pb id="VAC1001-283" n="271"/>public health. The health
              situation in the islands was very bad. Much of the alleged inefficiency of native
              labor was found to be due to such conditions. A successful campaign against smallpox
              was conducted throughout the islands. By an efficient marine quarantine cholera has
              been absolutely eliminated. The lepers have been segregated, and the average number of
              new cases reduced from seven hundred annually to three hundred. At present a campaign
              is being pressed against tuberculosis, the greatest single cause of death in the
              islands.</p>
            <p>With these general improvements have gone others, such as the development of an
              adequate system of highways and roads, all of which have contributed to a remarkable
              degree of progress in the Philippines. In all of this the American people have taken
              interest and pride. When the question of Philippine independence comes into domestic
              politics from time to time, it is truly significant that both sides defend their
              particular policy, not on the ground that it is to the selfish interest of the United
              States, but on the ground that it is to the best interests of the Philippines. If
              national policy is ever dictated solely by devotion to traditional principles of
              justice and humanity, this would seem to be a case in point. What it has meant to the
              happiness, prosperity and well-being of the millions of Filipinos it would be
              difficult to exaggerate. With this record of achievement, every boy and girl can be
              given an honest thrill of pride and generous emotion. They can see anew something of
              the sacred trust that is left to the hands of government. Their interest in the
              government is enlisted because they find that its functions are pregnant with
              possibilities that appeal to their imagination and the generous instincts of youth. It
              is not necessary that there should go with this feeling of pride a false sense of
              complacency. If the matter is skilfully presented, it will not appeal to the pupils as
              a <pb id="VAC1001-284" n="272"/>completed task but only a worthy beginning, which
              vividly forecasts the marvelous possibilities of generous achievement, and which
              invites their sustained interest and support.</p>
            <p>These are but a few of the important functions of the federal government which
              illustrate its value and importance. To these may be added its contributions to the
              cause of public health, its efforts in behalf of the conservation of natural
              resources, its wonderful work in developing the agricultural possibilities of the
              country, its conduct of the postal system, the building and operation of the Panama
              Canal, and the regulation of commerce between the states and with foreign countries.
              In the exercise of the latter powers, it has prevented the instruments of interstate
              commerce from being used for purposes that are immoral and indecent. It has prevented
              the sale and shipment through interstate commerce of fraudulently adulterated foods
              and drugs. It has prohibited interstate monopolies and trusts that would arbitrarily
              control the market and levy unjust tribute upon the public. All of these functions
              that touch life at so many different points, are dependent for their proper exercise
              upon the ability, fidelity and patriotism of the men we send to Washington. In the
              selection of these men is determined the destiny of our nation. To bring this fact
              home, through the functional approach, to every pupil, to enlist his instinctive
              interest in the proper performance of the task, and to train his instinctive reactions
              along intelligent and effective lines, is the mission of that teacher who believes
              that dynamic Americanism is a vital force that has a practical service to perform.</p>
            <p>The student is now prepared for a consideration of the whole framework of government
              as the organized agency through which these functions are to be performed. Now he is
              ready to understand and comprehend its necessity, its importance and its functions. It
              is now a human <pb id="VAC1001-285" n="273"/>institution and not a maze of technical
              and philosophical conceptions. With this approach he does not see government from any
              other angle than as a means to an end, a cooperative device for the accomplishment of
              definite and important aims.</p>
            <p>But what about the source of this government and Constitution? Experience showed its
              framers what functions it would have to perform. Where did they get their ideas as to
              what kind of government would best perform them? Did they arrive at their conclusions
              from abstract reasoning? Did they have any experiences that would help them? These are
              problems that will prove fascinating and instructive. Obviously they had learned
              something from their experience under the Articles of Confederation. They had learned
              something, doubtless, from experiences garnered in the governments of their various
              states. For about two hundred years there had been governmental experiments in the New
              World. There were the first charters of governments granted to the first colonists,
              which were framed by the officers and ministers of the British Crown, the first one of
              which was Sir Walter Raleigh's charter of 1584. These first charters were drafted
              along the line of English trading companies, rather than of political institutions.
              The second class of sources was the constitutions adopted by the colonists themselves,
              generally with the authority of the Crown, but with little or no dictation from the
              Crown. The third class of sources was the constitutions adopted by the colonies after
              the Declaration of Independence. The fourth class of sources was the experiences and
              governments under the Continental Congresses and under the Articles of
              Confederation.</p>
            <p>It is impossible here to trace out the processes of evolution by which the various
              phases of the Federal Constitution, as finally adopted, were evolved. But that process
              should <pb id="VAC1001-286" n="274"/>be indicated and illustrated by at least one or
              two examples. Emphasis should be laid upon the fact that there were American
              experiences for two hundred years prior to the Constitution, and that to a large
              extent, the Constitution, like all other documents that have endured, contains a
              mosaic or composite picture of the experiences and aspirations of the people who
              adopted it. If it is desired to go into the governmental principles that underlie our
              government and Constitution, there is no more thorough and effective way than to trace
              the particular provision of the Constitution that is involved through the experience
              that produced it, and the masterly debates of the constitutional convention that
              analyzed and perfected it. Some teachers have found that a constitutional convention,
              formed by the members of the class, and debating the various provisions of the
              Constitution, relying upon the history of the period and the records of the convention
              for their material, is a most stimulating and effective way of bringing home to the
              consciousness of the pupil, the fundamental principles that are involved.</p>
            <p>Those who get such a view of the Constitution and the vital forces that produced it,
              will come away with a deeper appreciation of the tremendous problems confronted by the
              fathers, and of the sanity, courage and devotion with which their solution was
              effected. No one can follow the portentous struggles of the constitutional convention
              without a profound appreciation of the masterful intellects that grappled with the
              tremendous problems, the indomitable courage with which were stemmed the tides of
              impatience, bigotry, ignorance and despair, and of the unfaltering devotion to the
              cause of an enduring union, which characterized the mighty leaders of that historic
              body. These men were not perfect. The Constitution was not the work of omnipotent
              wisdom. It contains some of the imperfections of human hands. But in the light of
              prevailing <pb id="VAC1001-287" n="275"/>circumstances it presents one of the greatest
              achievements of statecraft that the world has ever seen. We want the youth of the land
              to honor the achievement for what it was. We want them to honor those traits of
              sanity, courage and devotion that gave us a constitution and that made of us a nation.
              We want this done, not in the spirit of sentimental hero worship, but in the spirit of
              keen, accurate and discriminating appreciation of the great things that were achieved.
              From the virile qualities of our indomitable pioneers we want our youth to gain
              sanity, courage and inspiration for the tasks that some day will be theirs.</p>
            <p>We thus find illustrated in the federal government and its varied functions, the same
              fundamental principles of law, authority and government providing a basis for the
              cooperative effort that are essential to the conditions of modern life. As the rules
              of the family and the existence of domestic authority were essential to effective
              family life, so are they to the community, the state and the nation. There was a
              community of interests wider than the family that made community organization
              indispensable to modern life. That community of interests, being wider than the
              locality, required the larger unit of the state for the satisfaction of its various
              needs. The fathers also discovered that there was a community of interests between the
              states that could not safely be ignored, and national government and authority were
              established. Intelligent and forward-looking statesmen are now considering to what
              extent there may be such a community of interests between the great nations of the
              world, and how far such community of interests requires international organization and
              authority for its adequate protection.</p>
            <p>Again I fear that it may be thought that there is too much emphasis upon the
              fundamental ideas of law, authority and government, as the basis of the modern
              cooperative efforts <pb id="VAC1001-288" n="276"/>that are essential to our
              civilization. But if there is one danger to our institutions that I apprehend above
              all others, with the exception of popular indifference to the public weal, it is that
              in the stress and strain of some great industrial crisis, through which we may be
              called on to pass, our people will temporarily forget that it is only through just
              laws, efficient government and established authority that democracy may be made
              secure. In the conflicts between capital and labor and in similar periods of unrest,
              the only bulwark of democracy that is secure, is a just and adequate system of law
              that will afford a fair standard for the regulation and adjustment of the joint
              efforts of capital and labor, an impartial and efficient government to apply that
              standard, and the authority of a unified nation to see that it shall be enforced.</p>
            <p>If we postpone the task of perfecting our legal standards, of developing a just
              theory of distribution, or of mobilizing the public opinion of the nation behind a
              program of justice, law and authority, until the evil is upon us and a conflict has
              developed, it may then be too late to act. But if the youth of the land can be trained
              to an appreciation of the necessity of a just system of law, an efficient and
              impartial government, and the righteous settlement of these problems as they arise,
              democracy will be secure. Against such a bulwark the forces of unrest, ignorance and
              revolt will beat in vain.</p>

            <head rend="center sc">FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION OF POLITICAL PARTIES</head>
            <p><hi rend="b">I</hi>N A RECENT magazine occurred a vivid description of the
              organization of an attack in modern war. Many miles to the rear of the front-line
              trenches was pictured the commanding officer in charge, confronted with military maps,
              giving in minutest detail the topography of the battle-field, the location of the
              troops and the arrangement of the artillery. Connecting the headquarters of the
              general in charge with the subordinate officers who were to execute his plans, were
              all the varied methods of communication that modern invention could devise. In front
              of headquarters were located the great guns of longest range, trained to play upon the
              lines of the enemy ten to fifteen miles beyond. A little farther on were located the
              guns of smaller caliber, and then the shrapnel guns, and then finally, in the
              front-line trenches, the private soldier with his rifle. The writer described the
              marvelous skill and detail with which the general and his staff planned every step of
              the attack. He described the terrible artillery assaults that preceded, the fearful
              barrage that was laid down to protect the advance, and finally the desperate
              encounters and struggle of the privates as they fought their way to victory. The
              dramatic account brought out in bold relief one fundamental and significant fact,
              that, in the last analysis, it was the private soldier who won the victory. The
              greatest general the world has ever known, the mightiest artillery that has ever been
              assembled, the most destructive gas that science has invented, all would have failed
              but for the <pb id="VAC1001-293" n="281"/>discipline, courage and sense of individual
              responsibility of the private.</p>
            <p>Had the private reasoned that he was only one among thousands and of no importance,
              had he sought to escape his personal accountability in the mere mass of numbers, had
              he left the responsibility for failure or success upon officers and comrades, defeat
              and not victory would have been his lot. This simple fact illustrates a vital need in
              civic training. Military discipline and training brought home to every soldier a keen
              sense of personal responsibility. It was accomplished by driving home, with telling
              vividness, the importance of his humble task until victory or defeat or life or death
              were identified in his consciousness with duty or neglect. When it is recalled that
              this discipline was accomplished in a few months, and with boys gathered at random
              from every walk in life, it becomes significant. The secret seems to lie in the
              intensity of interest aroused by the serious nature of the task, and in making clear
              the line of duty and the overwhelming importance of its performance.</p>
            <p>I have attempted to show in the preceding chapters how the tragic nature of civic
              problems may be utilized to arouse an intensity of interest that would become a real
              dynamic force. But this force will be ineffective unless with it goes a clear
              understanding of the line of duty to be followed, and a sense of individual
              responsibility that can not be evaded in the magnitude of the task or lost in the
              great mass of countless citizens. As the efficiency of the soldier is obtained by
              drilling him in his specific tasks, and impressing upon him the practicability and
              importance of his part, even though he be but one among thousands, so the pupil must
              be drilled and instructed in the practical performance of civic duty and impressed
              with the fundamental importance of his individual activity, so that he will not
              neglect <pb id="VAC1001-294" n="282"/>his duty, either through a sense of impotence or
              a feeling of indifference. He must be made to feel that in the eternal struggle of
              democracy for decency and justice, he is a private in the front-line trenches, and
              that his part of the struggle must be aggressively and worthily performed.</p>
            <p>When one is intellectually equipped to grapple intelligently with public problems;
              when he is instinctively responsive to their significance and importance; when he
              knows enough about the government to determine accurately where to apply the pressure
              of his influence, even then he may be impotent, through failure to comprehend how that
              pressure may be applied. Even though his judgment be splendid, his sense of personal
              responsibility keen, and his desire to serve be strong, he can accomplish naught,
              unless he can bring his splendid talents to influence the sources of official power.
              This is not always easy nor is the way always clear. One of the greatest causes of
              popular indifference to political affairs, is the popular feeling of impotence. Among
              the most educated and cultured folk, as well as among the more ignorant, this feeling
              finds continual expression. "What is the use?" has become an alibi for failure to take
              an interest in civic affairs, that is entirely too common for the public good.</p>
            <p>This problem of democracy was foreseen by Edmond Burke, who suggested that the
              infinitesimal degree of personal responsibility that each one would bear for public
              wrongs and blunders, would make him feel unaccountable personally for the results,
              however tragic they might be. Add to this the further consideration that many people
              lack the imagination, patience and understanding to make what voice they have
              effective, and the forces of discouragement become tremendous. Indifference seems to
              be the inevitable result. No one will take a deep or sustained interest in public
              problems unless he feels that his efforts are <pb id="VAC1001-295" n="283"/>effective.
              He will not respond to the call of civic duty, if his endeavors are to be
              abortive.</p>
            <p>One of the essential problems of civic training, therefore, is to show how one's
              interest and devotion to the public weal may be made an effective force in the control
              of governmental power. When one realizes that he is but one among millions of voters,
              escape from the feeling of personal responsibility is frequently both easy and
              alluring. To meet this situation, there must be organized a dynamic sentiment of
              patriotism so powerful and profound that it will sustain a continued and determined
              effort. There must exist an intelligent appreciation of the problems involved, a
              detailed knowledge of how one's efforts are to be so intelligently directed that they
              will be practical, and a clear understanding that through such efforts progress will
              be sure, though frequently very slow. Ordinarily the only progress that is possible or
              desirable, must of necessity be slow. Civilization can not be made over in a day.
              Fundamental problems can not be solved by instantaneous solutions. And yet demagogues
              have promised so much, so many times, that superficial people, because the impossible
              was never done, have abandoned hope of progress. This difficulty will largely
              disappear as the evolutionary point of view becomes more thoroughly established and
              the people become accustomed to seeking progress through evolutionary instead of
              revolutionary programs.</p>
            <p>This leaves for our consideration the question of teaching the youth how to make
              their interest and devotion to the public weal a practical affair. This involves some
              of the following problems: How can one become an effective force for better
              government? How can one give aid and support to administrative or legislative measures
              that one believes to be for the public good? What practical ways are open to the
              average citizen to improve the efficiency of the <pb id="VAC1001-296" n="284"
              />government, as an instrument for the satisfaction of human needs? It is obvious that
              civic training is not complete until this has been accomplished. The relation of the
              citizen to his government and the ways of his possible participation therein, are
              fundamental matters, if dynamic Americanism is to be more than a mere academic theory.
              If it is to yield results in better government, in the development of a more perfect
              democracy, and in the solution of the public's problems, it must be translated into an
              accomplished fact. Dynamic Americanism, if it is to be practical, must function in
              terms of civic achievement.</p>
            <p>In taking up the specific problems above mentioned, many helpful suggestions will
              undoubtedly occur. A method of making these suggestions practical and realistic, is to
              bring some particular matter before the class, have them discuss it, and then consider
              how they can contribute to the accomplishment of the definite aim desired. For
              instance, if there is an ordinance pending in the city council, an important statute
              in the legislature, an interesting measure before Congress, or some kind of
              administrative decision by the executive, bring one of these before the class, and
              consider how the various members of the public can proceed to see that the proper
              views prevail. Letters from constituents to members of the bodies involved, will be
              one of the methods suggested, and is the one most commonly employed. To this the great
              objection will be made that one letter will accomplish nothing. This can be said of
              the individual voter in every election. It can be said of the private citizen in
              regard to every form of patriotic duty. If this objection be permitted to prevail, it
              is the negation of democracy itself, for in the last analysis, the action of democracy
              is the action of its individual members. If the privates in the front-line trenches
              had adopted this fatal fallacy, all the generals and military genius that the Allies
              could <pb id="VAC1001-297" n="285"/>have produced, all the artillery that they could
              concentrate upon the battle fronts, all the daring and brilliant air service that
              devotion and ingenuity could have contrived, would have come to naught. Not a trench
              could have been taken, the foe would never have been defeated, and the victory never
              could have been won, had the private soldier adopted this fatalistic point of view. As
              already noted, it was only by the heroism, devotion and self-sacrifice of the
              individual private that progress was achieved and victory secured.</p>
            <p>What was true of the military campaigns in Europe was equally true of the problems
              that we had to solve at home. The food controller and his staff of experts could work
              out the finest plans, they could devise the most ingenious substitutes for the needed
              foods, they could work out elaborate and comprehensive programs of conservation, but
              it would be useless, unless the individual citizens throughout the land were ready and
              willing to comply. In the last analysis, it was the willingness of the private citizen
              to deny himself for the common good that gave us victory. If every man had sought
              relief from patriotic duty on the ground that what one man might do would come to
              naught, we would have come to a disastrous defeat.</p>
            <p>Another example of a different kind, of what can be accomplished by individual effort
              is afforded by the struggle in the United States Senate over the ratification of the
              peace treaty and the league of nations. A private citizen of the city of New York, who
              had taken a deep interest in the league of nations and had made a careful study of the
              issues that were involved, began a campaign of letter-writing in behalf of his ideas.
              He wrote to the members of the Senate, to the prominent party leaders, and to his
              fellow citizens throughout the country, urging his convictions with strength and
              power. So clearly did he state his views, and <pb id="VAC1001-298" n="286"/>so
              convincing and sane were his proposals, and so practical were his suggestions, that
              the course of the treaty in the Senate was very visibly affected by the efforts of a
              private citizen who had determination, public spirit and common sense.</p>
            <p>The importance of one's taking his responsibility seriously, and seeking to have a
              voice in the control of government, is accentuated by the fact that in many public
              issues, there is a determined organized minority fighting against the real interests
              of the majority, and the minority frequently wins through the indifference of the
              public. It is very popular, on such occasions, to shout about invisible government and
              autocratic power, but the plain unvarnished facts are that the minority won through
              the acquiescence of the majority. A former governor of one of our states once told me
              of an intense political struggle in which he had been engaged, and which involved the
              liquor question. There was no doubt but that the great majority of the people of that
              state were in favor of the drys, and it was on this side that the governor had aligned
              himself. The situation was intense. Partisan spirit was keen and bitter. The wets
              fought with the deadly precision of an organization that was trained and
              disciplined.</p>
            <p>The governor asked his secretary to keep separate all the communications of those
              supporting his stand from those opposing it. He wanted to weigh the evidence. Opposing
              his position were telegrams from every section of the state, from every political
              party and from people in every walk in life. They threatened, argued and pleaded. Men
              who were political leaders in the community wrote, demanding that he change his
              position or that they would appear at the next state convention, with the delegation
              from their counties pledged against the governor. Men called up on long <pb
                id="VAC1001-299" n="287"/>distance to say that they would come to the next
              convention as delegates against him, unless he changed his views. On the other hand,
              the governor did not get a single letter from any man promising to organize a
              delegation in his behalf at the next convention, if he would win the fight. No man
              called on the long distance to say that he would come to the next convention as a
              delegate to fight in the governor's support, in case he proved faithful to the end. He
              received very few telegrams approving his stand and only a very small percentage of
              the letters received supported his position. Almost single-handed and alone, against
              such pressure as few men ever have to meet, this governor fought the battle for the
              majority and won. If there are evil influences affecting our political life, one may
              rest assured that they are active and at work. If just and enlightened laws conflict
              with corrupt or selfish interests, these interests will find a way to make their voice
              effective. Unless the private individuals, who have no interests save those of
              patriotism and love of justice, can fight with equal spirit and determination, wrong
              must frequently prevail. And if it does not prevail, it will be because of the daring
              courage of some public leader, like the governor mentioned above, who can withstand
              the pressure of the assault and protect the public from the evils of their own
              neglect. But no man with red blood and a sense of justice should seek a selfish safety
              in the unsupported power of a strong and fearless leader.</p>
            <p>Many other ways of bringing private influence to bear in shaping the conduct of
              government will doubtless suggest themselves, such as group action and resolutions by
              civic clubs, chambers of commerce, and other groups who interest themselves in public
              problems. Joint debates and public discussion may also play an important part. To the
              alert and interested, many means of making their voices heard in <pb id="VAC1001-300"
                n="288"/>the councils of the government may be found, if they can be brought to
              realize the importance of individual accountability, and that such means are practical
              and effective.</p>
            <p>It is in this connection that we come to the question of political parties, the part
              they play in the life of our government, and the proper relations of the citizen to
              the party. There seem to be few topics more misunderstood, where so much "bunk" passes
              for reason, and prejudice so completely supplants facts, than the subject of political
              parties, and yet there is no one aspect of our political life that is so fundamental
              to our governmental progress and success. In the past few years it has been the
              fashion to denounce political parties, machines and bosses. One state went so far as
              to consider the abolition of political parties by law. If things went wrong, the
              public business was neglected and public problems were unsolved, it was the fault of
              parties. Decent and even intelligent men frequently sought alibis from a guilty
              conscience, by asserting that politics was too corrupt, and that honest men must hold
              themselves aloof. It was seriously argued, by those opposed to women's suffrage, that
              it should not be adopted for the reason that party politics was so fundamentally
              corrupt that women's morals would be placed in jeopardy. Demagogues have assured a too
              eager and credulous public, that for all these ills the public is not to blame, but it
              should be laid at the door of parties, bosses and machines.</p>
            <p>With these facts in view, it becomes highly important that any training in civics
              should include a thorough understanding of the party system. If it is to blame for all
              our ills, it is time that we should attack it, and if it is not, it is time that we
              cease fighting windmills and get down to solid facts. Beginning with the problem
              method, we should set the pupils to the task of determining why political parties were
              organized. Who organized them? What functions <pb id="VAC1001-301" n="289"/>do they
              perform? Could we abolish political parties? These and many similar questions would
              soon direct the students to the discovery that one of the first purposes of a party,
              and the reason for its organization, was to provide a method of nominating candidates
              for public office. When the fathers adopted our Federal and early State Constitutions,
              they provided that certain officers should be elected by popular vote, but they made
              no provision for the nomination of the candidates to be elected. Unless candidates are
              nominated and announce certain principles for which they stand, so that the public may
              choose between men and principles, how can the public control the government?</p>
            <p>This difficulty may not appear at first, but a few questions and illustrations will
              suffice. When in the fourth grade of the public school I recall an incident that will
              make it clear. The school authorities decided the pupils should march in the memorial
              day parade to the cemetery, that the school should march by classes, and that each
              class should elect a captain to march at the head of the class. The teacher asked the
              pupils, without giving them an opportunity to talk it over, to vote by secret ballot
              for a captain. Out of about thirty votes, one boy got five and was elected, most boys
              getting the one vote they had cast for themselves. The boy who was elected was easily
              the most unpopular boy in the class, and we always suspected that he got the five
              votes by promising the four boys around him to vote for each of them if they would
              vote for him, and then voting for himself. No one could say that the election
              represented the public opinion of the class. Had there been nominations, so that the
              class would have been given a choice between a smaller number of candidates, a
              candidate could have been elected by a majority of the class instead of by a very
              small minority. Nominations are absolutely necessary if public opinion is to prevail,
              and without that there can be no popular <pb id="VAC1001-302" n="290"/>government.
              Suppose we should attempt to elect a president of the United States without the aid of
              nominating conventions. There would probably be as many "prominent candidates" as
              there are states in the Union. Each commonwealth would come forth with its "favorite
              son" and the man selected might come to the presidency of the United States with no
              other support, and with no other point of view than that of his native state. Such
              conditions would be intolerable.</p>
            <p>But with political parties representing the people of like political opinions and
              tendencies from the several states, sending their representatives to a great political
              convention, where the claims of all the "favorite sons" are thrashed out and a man
              nominated that can command the votes of a majority of all the representatives of his
              party, the public is given a choice between two or three candidates of national
              reputation, and through the choice of one of them, public opinion can intelligently
              prevail.</p>
            <p>But this is not all. A few searching questions will disclose the fact that the public
              must not only select officers, but they must approve certain principles, if they are
              to control the government. If the people merely elect officers without knowing the
              things for which they stand, and without an opportunity to express an opinion upon any
              principles or theories of government, or upon any program of action to guide the
              officers in the performance of their duty, how can the government be a government by
              the people? Popular government means one in which public opinion prevails. But how can
              it prevail unless an opportunity is given to the public to approve or reject certain
              programs for governmental action? Recognizing this fact, it did not take the people
              long to realize that if they wanted to control the government in the interests of the
              theories that they held, they must organize for that definite task. People who <pb
                id="VAC1001-303" n="291"/>believed in a set of governmental theories, got together,
              selected their leaders as the candidates for public office, adopted a platform of the
              principles for which they stood, and to which their candidate was pledged, and placed
              these before the public for their approval. The election of their candidates meant
              that the government would be operated along the lines suggested by the platform of
              principles. For convenience they found it necessary to adopt a name for their
              organization, and a distinctive emblem to indicate which of the various candidates for
              public office were pledged to their principles. This was a political party. The people
              of the country divided into two large parties, with a number of smaller ones. It is
              these parties that nominate candidates for offices and draw up the platforms upon
              which the public votes to-day. The only instrumentality that we have so far been able
              to invent, by which public opinion can prevail throughout a large territory like a
              state or the nation, is the political party. It is, therefore, indispensable to the
              life of a democracy.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all of the important work performed by the various parties. It soon
              became evident that if those holding a certain line of political beliefs, such as
              those favoring a protective tariff, desired victory, they could only win their point
              by convincing the majority of the voters of the country that the system of protective
              tariff was desirable. The tariff problem is a complicated question. It requires a
              great deal of study, the analysis of a great many statistics, and an understanding of
              fundamental economic theory. Obviously this could not be done by the average citizen
              without a great deal of assistance. The parties, realizing this, have proceeded to
              develop programs of popular education. Tons of literature, in which the problems are
              stated in simple terms, the statistics analyzed in easy forms, and the arguments
              advanced in such simple style that they can be comprehended <pb id="VAC1001-304"
                n="292"/>with the minimum of difficulty, are printed and circulated to the voters of
              the entire nation. In addition, speakers are employed to engage in public discussion,
              and occasionally joint debates between opposing candidates are staged. Advertising
              space is purchased in newspapers and on bulletin boards, and every conceivable device
              resorted to, to bring the candidates of the party and the platform upon which they
              stand, to the attention of the country. Party newspapers are frequently established or
              endorsed as party organs, and add their resources to the publicity efforts of the
              campaign. This requires vast sums of money and elaborate organizations, covering the
              entire country, and reaching from every precinct to the national committee of the
              various parties.</p>
            <p>It may be objected that much of this popular education, in which the party engages,
              is not helpful, because so partisan and unfair. Undoubtedly there is more than a grain
              of truth in the assertion; nevertheless many people are dependent upon the activity of
              political parties for much of their political education, and it is this fact that
              makes the party a tremendously important factor in public affairs. Perhaps one of the
              most significant examples of how such methods may influence public opinion is
              evidenced by the campaign of 1896, when the silver question was the issue between the
              two contending parties. Shrewd political observers generally agree that the decision
              would have been different had the election been held six weeks earlier, thereby
              implying that the campaign of education among the voters, on behalf of the gold
              standard, was particularly effective. This is not the place to discuss whether that
              result was good or bad, so far as the issues were concerned, but it is significant
              that there could be such a change in public opinion as a result of a political
              campaign. Any <pb id="VAC1001-305" n="293"/>organization that has that much influence
              with the voters of the land, is deserving our special study and consideration.</p>
            <p>Thus we find our modern political parties with their intricate and elaborate
              organization, like other political institutions, to be a product of evolution. They
              have come into being to meet certain specific needs, <hi rend="i">viz</hi>., the
              nomination of candidates, the promulgation of political issues, and the conduct of
              political campaigns with their programs of popular education. The parties have evolved
              in form and organization, as experience has shown more clearly the necessity of these
              functions and the better methods of performing them. In the early days candidates were
              nominated by legislative and congressional caucuses. Candidates for state office were
              nominated by the party members of the legislature, and candidates for the presidency
              were nominated by the party members of Congress. Thus the Federalist members of a
              state legislature nominated the Federalist candidates for state office, and like
              procedure prevailed in Congress for the nomination of a Federalist candidate for
              Congress. It took some time for even this simple method to develop, and before then,
              nominations were made in any way possible, by the voluntary efforts of a few friends,
              through the suggestions of influential leaders, by mass meetings, and any other
              methods of attracting public attention that might be devised.</p>
            <p>The legislative caucus, when once established, prevailed in one form or another until
              the development of the modern party organization which occurred during the thirties.
              The disappearance of the legislative caucus was due to certain inherent weaknesses
              which we need not here consider. The modern political party, which has changed
              radically in detail and method in recent years, still persists for the sole reason
              that it has a tremendous function to perform for which no better means have been
              devised.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-306" n="294"/>
            <p>In spite of these obvious facts, the popular and unthinking condemnation of political
              parties has continued. It is true that serious abuses have developed from time to
              time, in which party organizations have been guilty of immoral and criminal conduct.
              Undiscriminating criticism against parties <hi rend="i">per se</hi>, has blinded many
              to the important fact that it is only through parties that public opinion can be made
              articulate in the control of government. People have forgotten that political parties
              are nothing more or less than the people of the country, divided into groups according
              to political opinions, preferences or prejudices. Political parties as such are no
              more immoral than are the people politically immoral. If there is no hope for
              democracy because of the rottenness of political parties, then there is no hope for
              popular government, because of the rottenness of the people. If a man is too good to
              be associated with the evils of political parties, then he is too good to live in the
              same community with his fellow citizens, for it is the latter that compose the former.
              When one becomes so self-righteous that he holds himself aloof from practical politics
              because of their alleged abuses, then he is too good for this world and the wicked
              problems that it contains. Such an attitude of moral superiority is both selfish and
              cowardly.</p>
            <p>Until some better means is devised of nominating candidates for public office,
              adopting platforms and conducting campaigns, political parties will be essential to
              our democracy. They are the necessary instruments of popular control. If they do not
              give us good candidates, or provide good platforms, or conduct wholesome campaigns, it
              is because those of us who compose the parties have not yet demanded it with
              sufficient force and in sufficient numbers. The remedy is to be found in more active
              participation in party affairs, and not in abandoning them to the mercy of the
              professional. If our parties have not kept pace with the <pb id="VAC1001-307" n="295"
              />demands of modern life, the time has come for every citizen who believes in
              patriotic duty, to become an effective factor in some political organization, in order
              to make them effective instruments of democracy. If party management has been
              indifferent and incompetent, out of those very facts should come the challenge to
              enter their ranks in a determined struggle for their perfection. Political parties are
              not something separate and apart from the people, but are the creations and
              instruments of the people. They are the people politically organized. It is only
              through them and their perfection that constructive achievements can be accomplished.
              It is with these instruments that the public must contend against the forces of
              ignorance, indifference and reaction. With the realization of this fundamental fact, a
              constructive attitude toward parties becomes possible. The pupil must see in them not
              an object of despair, but the means of hope. He must realize that the path of civic
              duty leads through them and not away from them.</p>
            <p>We are now ready to consider the detail of the party organization. After the
              necessity of its existence has been established, and its functions have been
              discussed, the student is now ready to comprehend the organization as it has been
              developed. This is not the place to discuss this matter in detail but only in general
              outline. The modern organization of political parties is made up of three hierarchies,
              a hierarchy of conventions or primaries, a hierarchy of committees, and a hierarchy of
              bosses or leaders. There is at the top, the national party convention, composed of
              delegates from the various states and congressional districts. This convention
              nominates candidates for the presidency and vice-presidency, elects the members of the
              national committees, and adopts the national platform for the party. Then there is a
              state convention that performs the same function for the party in the state, and which
              is <pb id="VAC1001-308" n="296"/>made up of delegates from the political divisions of
              the state. In some states, most of these functions are performed by direct primaries,
              instead of by the party conventions. Then there are the county conventions or
              primaries for performing the same general functions for the county. Of course there
              are also conventions or primaries for all of the other political subdivisions of the
              state, but those just mentioned are the backbone of the system.</p>
            <p>The hierarchy of committees, parallels the hierarchy of conventions or primaries,
              from the national central committee, composed of one member from each state, and whose
              function it is to conduct the campaigns, arrange for conventions, raise the party
              funds and look out for the general interests of the party in national affairs, down to
              the state central committee, the county central committee and the township or precinct
              committeeman. The third hierarchy, the hierarchy of bosses or leaders, is the group of
              national leaders, state leaders or local leaders, whose capacity for organization and
              leadership has won for them the dominant influence in their respective groups.</p>
            <p>Here perhaps it may be wise to make a suggestion about the nature of the boss. So
              much has been uttered and written in reckless condemnation of the political boss and
              the professional politician that the public have come to look upon them as enemies to
              society. The demagogue has found an alibi for the indifferent public in the evils of
              the political boss. The facts are that the people generally get just about the kind of
              government that they deserve. They pay no attention to it, until it gets hopelessly
              corrupt, then they awaken to a realization of the facts, and rather than accept the
              responsibility that is their own, they greedily seize the excuse that it is the work
              of the political boss. Quite frequently the facts are that the political bosses have
              been doing the best they could, but have been unable to get the <pb id="VAC1001-309"
                n="297"/>support of the intelligent and respectable classes, and have been driven,
              as a matter of political necessity, to take the steps they have. This has led to a
              general and indiscriminate cry against the boss. His elimination from our political
              life has been demanded. But a moment's consideration will show the fallacy of the
              position. One might as well try to run a railroad company without a manager, a
              university without a president, a school without a superintendent or principal, or the
              nation without a chief executive as to have a great political organization without one
              or more dominant personalities at its head.</p>
            <p>Every successful church has a few members who find a considerable portion of their
              pleasure in the service of the church. They are the ones who make most of the motions
              at business meetings, who serve on important committees, who are never too busy to do
              the work that is required. We call them the pillars of the church. Every lodge and
              fraternal organization which is efficient has its little group of men who do the great
              proportion of the work, determine its policies and identify its welfare with their
              own. Every successful civic club or organization has back of it a few guiding souls,
              whose imagination, initiative, devotion and industry, make possible its record of
              achievement, and we call them the public-spirited men of the community. It is true
              that there are some who do not give these men the praise that they deserve. There are
              always a few, in every organization, who sit in the scoffers' seat in the rear, who
              never make any motions, never have time to serve on any committees, never work out any
              programs, and never approve of what the others do. They sit in silence and "knock"
              afterward. "The same old 'bunch' running things" is the burden of their complaint. Why
              do not they run things? Because they are too lazy, indifferent, or mediocre, to take a
              part, while they jealously condemn those who do.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-310" n="298"/>
            <p>In every political party, in every community, there is a group of men who naturally
              take an interest in politics. They like the human aspects of the problem. They enjoy
              the leadership they are able to obtain here. They enjoy the political importance that
              it gives them as public men. With many men, politics is a religion, and they give to
              it the same passionate devotion that others give to their theology. They keep informed
              as to the political questions of the community. They serve on the party committees, or
              stand behind the scenes to plan and advise and scheme. They are the ones who seek out
              the "likely" candidates, arrange for the party primaries, when not provided for by
              law, and look after the interests of the party, the same as the pillars of the church
              bear the responsibility of its activities. In other words, the boss and politician is
              the man who makes the political matters of his community his personal interest and
              concern. Yet we honor the men who serve the church and speak of them as the "pillars,"
              while we recklessly condemn those whose public spirit, temperament or ambitions have
              made them interested in politics to the point of assuming the political responsibility
              of the community. But some will respond that political bosses are narrow, partisan and
              dishonest. So, also, are pillars of the church occasionally. They frequently confuse
              means with ends, or become autocratic or narrowly sectarian or partisan. Occasionally
              they have been found to be dishonest. But without them the church can not exist. So,
              without the politicians, political parties and democracy would suffer much. How
              powerful and autocratic the boss will be depends on how indifferent the people are.
              His power increases in exact proportion with popular indifference. Also with popular
              indifference his necessity to popular government increases with corresponding ratio,
              for public affairs must be run, and if people will not run them, the bosses or
              politicians must.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-311" n="299"/>
            <p>Some one may object that I am confusing political bosses and political leaders. Much
              fine-spun theory might be developed in trying to work out distinction, but it would be
              of no practical value or importance. Whatever name they may go by, there will always
              be a group of dominant personalities back of every political organization. The
              important thing is to understand this fact and order one's political life and
              interests accordingly. There has been no more fruitful source of power for the
              demagogue than the attempted distinction between the leader and the boss. When nicely
              analyzed, the only practical distinction is that a boss belongs to your party and the
              leaders to mine.</p>
            <p>The hierarchy of committees, conventions and politicians that compose your party
              organization is a political "machine" with all the sinister connotations that the word
              implies, while the same kind of arrangements in my party constitute our organization.
              Nowhere in modern politics is there such a splendid example of the tyranny of an
              established phrase. Nowhere in modern thinking has there been evidenced such servile
              following of ignorant and unreasoning prejudice. The most autocratic bosses that the
              country has seen have ridden to power by denouncing the opposition as boss ridden, and
              decrying the organization as a "machine." One of the most discouraging factors in the
              present political situation is the ease with which the public may be diverted from a
              sane and intelligent interest in the fundamental problems of public policy and
              efficient administration, by an appeal to this trite and hypocritical device. The
              unscrupulous and selfish interests in our public life will always thrive to just the
              extent that the people may be diverted from the real issues of public efficiency. It
              is under the protection of these false issues that the worst elements escape
              detection. It is behind the "smoke screens" of such fabricated issues that the most
              sinister influences ply their <pb id="VAC1001-312" n="300"/>trade. Nor is there any
              hope for permanent improvement until they can be driven into the open, and political
              campaigns fought out upon the fundamental issues of the social efficiency of the
              government.</p>
            <p>It must not be supposed that I am implying that all men who appeal to this
              time-honored protest against the rule of bosses and machines represent sinister
              influences or corrupt motives. Such is not the case. However high a man's motives may
              be, if he runs for public office, he must make the appeal that wins, if he would
              accomplish the ends he has in view. Too frequently such an appeal seems to be the only
              method, because of the unwillingness of the people to respond to arguments more
              fundamental and profound. Nor must it be supposed that there are not good bosses and
              bad bosses. Just as I protest against the indiscriminate abuse of politicians, I
              oppose their indiscriminate defense. It is one thing to oppose a party because the men
              who control its policies may be unworthy of public confidence; it is another thing to
              oppose them because they have a "machine" and bosses, something that every party
              always has had and always will have.</p>
            <p>The significant thing to remember and the fact that must be driven home with repeated
              emphasis, until it is comprehended by the student, is that political parties with
              their machinery and their bosses are part of the necessary equipment of democracy.
              They are a means to an end, <hi rend="i">viz</hi>., the articulation of such public
              opinion as there is, into the accomplished facts of government. Like all other
              instruments of government they may be abused. Like all other forms of organization,
              people may forget that it is a means to an end, and look upon the party and party
              success as an end in itself, regardless of the public weal. Whether or not these
              instrumentalities render genuine service to the public, depends on the intelligent
              devotion and patriotism with which the <pb id="VAC1001-313" n="301"/>public use them.
              Democracy will not operate itself. Its success will depend on the public opinion which
              it reflects. The most that can be said for democratic forms of government is that they
              reflect public opinion accurately. It does not make public opinion. It does not solve
              problems. It does not grapple with the reactionary forces that bar the pathways of
              progress. Back of all of these forms and instrumentalities, therefore, there must be
              the intelligence and the sense of personal accountability, that can and will function
              through them, that will fight triumphantly with the forces of reaction, and find a
              just and righteous solution for the public problems.</p>
            <p>Several years ago I was invited into a western state to speak before a large civic
              body, organized in the interests of political and social reform. Upon reaching my
              destination I was met by a committee, who made it very clear to me that what they most
              desired of me was a ringing denunciation of the state boss of the dominant party, and
              a savage attack upon the mayor of the city, to which personages these good people had
              attributed all the failures and evils of their state and local governments,
              respectively. I had to inform them that such was not my business. I called their
              attention to the fact that the mayor was already serving his third term as mayor of
              the city, having been three times elected by a plurality of the lawfully qualified
              electorate. It followed, therefore, that if he was such an outrageous character, that
              the persons against whom I should direct denunciation and scorn were the legally
              qualified electorate of the city. Moreover, the state boss whom they disliked, like
              all other state bosses, was absolutely harmless, except in so far as he could carry
              with him the people of the state. He had absolutely no power except in so far as he
              was able to get two-thirds of the members of his party convention, whose members had
              been elected by <pb id="VAC1001-314" n="302"/>the party members of the state, to
              nominate candidates that he could influence or control. But even after that, he could
              accomplish nothing and possessed no power, until he had secured the election of these
              candidates by the lawfully qualified electorate of the state. If he had power which he
              had abused, it was because the people of his party had given it to him in the
              convention, and because the people of the state had approved it at the ballot box. In
              fact this same boss has frequently remarked that the source of his power was his
              ability to give the people what they desired. All of which shows the great fundamental
              truth, that the people get just the kind of government that their intelligent interest
              in civic matters deserves.</p>
            <p>Naturally the committee took exception to my position, which shoved a large portion
              of the blame upon the voters of the state and city, and robbed them of their cherished
              alibi. But as I pressed home the facts that a boss had no power over affairs of state
              except as he was able to influence those whom the voters had placed in power, and had
              continued in power, they staked out another line of defense. They said that the
              majority of the people of the city did not want the kind of government that they were
              enjoying. When asked why they had reelected the mayor to office twice, if the people
              of the city did not desire him and his administration, they replied that the voters
              insisted on voting their party ticket, regardless of the local issues, while the
              forces who wanted the mayor, the determined organized minority, switched from one
              party to another, and controlled the balance of power, between the parties, and thus
              controlled the politics of the city. Why, then, did not the good people of the city,
              organized into a determined organized majority, select capable political leaders, and
              elect their own officers of the city. The reason was that when they attempted to form
              such organizations, they would <pb id="VAC1001-315" n="303"/>develop factional fights,
              partisanship would creep in, and some would insist on allowing national and state
              political issues to dominate the local election, although there was no relation
              between the two. If the organization developed leaders of strength and power, many
              individuals would refuse them their support, because they were too much like political
              bosses whom they hated. When the majority agreed upon candidates and leaders, the
              minority, who were outvoted, frequently declined to follow the will of the majority,
              and their efforts came to naught.</p>
            <p>This was a typical situation. The people who were interested in a decent
              administration could not agree among themselves. If outvoted by their fellow citizens,
              they would quit. Some were too bigoted to adjust their will to those of the majority.
              Others were too jealous to acquiesce in allowing their leaders to have the necessary
              power to make an effective fight. Still others thought more of their party name than
              they did of their city. Underlying it all was the great outstanding fact that the good
              citizens of the city were not devoted to the public weal with the same fidelity, the
              same practical judgment, and the same willingness to fight and endure, that
              characterized the forces of evil. Pride of intellect, petty jealousies, a narrowly
              partisan spirit, and love of ease, too easily triumphed over their spirit of
              patriotism and their civic righteousness. Direct primaries, party reforms, the
              denunciation of bosses, by themselves, will accomplish nothing. Not until the forces
              of decency and civic pride will develop a machinery and a group of bosses as
              intelligent, determined and powerful as the opposition, can they hope for permanent
              reform.</p>
            <p>Civic training can not be practical or adequate without this understanding of the
              nature and necessity of party machinery and party bosses. They are the indispensable
              instrumentalities of popular control. The character of the <pb id="VAC1001-316"
                n="304"/>service that they will perform is determined by the character of the
              control that the public will apply. The remedy for the evils of party government is
              primarily and fundamentally more intelligence and patriotism among party members.
              Party reforms of structural nature may be very valuable. Legal regulation that will
              prevent certain well-known abuses will help materially. But the real problems of
              democracy to-day are constructive, not negative. To eliminate abuses is wise and
              salutary, but the life of democracy demands much more. It demands the solution of
              modern problems. It demands machinery and public opinion that is not only honest but
              intelligent. It demands programs of governmental action that are not only well-meaning
              but masterful and effective. It demands not only an emotional response in the time of
              emergency and urgent need, but a sustained, aggressive and determined Americanism that
              will thrill with the stern joy of conflict in the deadly struggle with the foes of
              justice and humanity.</p>
            <p>With this understanding of the nature and functions of political parties, we are now
              ready to consider the relation of the citizen to the party. It is in this connection
              that we come to the most effective way in which the citizen is to make himself an
              effective factor in the processes of democracy. In the preceding chapters we have
              tried to show the importance of governmental functions. We have attempted to show that
              their tremendous human implication, their tragic significance, and their dramatic
              appeals are sufficiently potent to arouse the emotional interest of the child in the
              efficiency of the government that performs those functions. We have tried to show how,
              through this method, the basis of a public opinion could be laid that would function
              as patriotically and courageously behind these functions of peace as it has in behalf
              of the enterprises of war. But how will this public opinion find expression? How will
                <pb id="VAC1001-317" n="305"/>the individual be effective in the great struggle
              involving so many? In the early part of this chapter several methods have been
              suggested, but the most important one is through party membership and activity.</p>
            <p>If the parties are the instruments through which public opinion becomes effective,
              then it follows that it is there that the individual's fullest opportunities are
              found. He should become a member of a party&mdash;not merely a passive member wearing
              the party label and accepting the party dictates, but an aggressive member, fighting
              the party's battles, helping to do its thinking, laboring for better candidates, and
              contending for better principles. Those who are too broad-minded for political
              parties, and too good for practical politics, are worse than valueless to a political
              democracy. It is true that no thinking and intelligent man will find any party whose
              principles exactly coincide with his. No man will find any list of party candidates
              who represent exactly his discriminating choice. Nor will any one find a church whose
              theology fits in entirely with his own, and yet churches are essential to the
              development of our religious life. Honest and intelligent compromise between
              conflicting points of view is the very genius of democracy, and those who can not
              become a factor in the compromising process, are too anarchistic to be effective
              members in the highly-organized society of to-day.</p>
            <p>There are many things in party politics that are disappointing and discouraging.
              There are many things of which high-minded individuals can not approve. There are many
              principles enunciated, that are not always sound, or are not honestly intended. There
              is excessive partisanship which forgets that the only justification of the political
              party is the service of the country, and which is tempted to sacrifice public welfare
              to partisan advantage. The more one knows of party politics, the more illustrations of
              these tendencies <pb id="VAC1001-318" n="306"/>one is able to discover. But these are
              not the peculiar ills of political parties. These are not their exclusive possessions.
              These are the regular orthodox evils and frailties of human nature. They inhere in all
              things human. They find expression in every form of organized activity. The man who
              avoids his duty to political parties because of these evils is on the intellectual and
              moral par with the man who damns the church because of its human weaknesses, who
              "knocks" the efforts of civic organizations because their leaders are finite beings,
              who denounces the Red Cross because the management of its affairs has been placed into
              human hands, and who opposes every other form of organized progress because it is
              accompanied with some of the manifestation of human frailties. Such a person is
              looking for alibis from the duties of democracy, and is not in search of opportunities
              to serve. Or he may represent a certain phase of intellectual and moral snobbery that
              refuses to play a part, but with superb self-righteousness decries the efforts of
              those who do.</p>
            <p>The defects of political parties, for this reason, should not be concealed. Neither
              should they be emphasized. The school-room is the last place in the world for the
              activities of the professional "muck raker" or his followers. An analysis of the
              organization and functions of the party, and its relations to the business of popular
              government, if properly presented from the evolutionary and functional point of view,
              will give to the average student a wholesome appreciation of the party system. The
              evils that exist are the same old evils of selfishness and greed, ignorance and
              indifference, narrowness and bigotry that are not the products of the party system,
              but that merely find expression here as they do in the whole domain of human effort.
              As far as these evils exist, they will constitute a challenge to his manhood and
              patriotism to offset their evil influence. If he <pb id="VAC1001-319" n="307"/>has
              acquired a dynamic interest in government he will see in the avenues of party activity
              an opportunity to make that interest effective. If he has developed a vision of what
              democracy should mean, he will find here the practical machinery through which that
              vision is to be achieved. If he has learned the great truth that he is his brother's
              keeper, it is here that he will find the chance to make good that obligation. If the
              educational process has developed in him the sentiment of dynamic Americanism, it is
              in the party struggle for higher ideals, nobler leaders and more efficient candidates,
              that this sentiment can become triumphant.</p>
            <p>This does not mean that the citizen will become a party slave. It does not mean that
              he will surrender his judgment and conscience to the keeping of others. It means
              merely the recognition of the vital, fundamental fact that no one dare deny, that the
              public can not vote for better candidates, loftier principles and nobler leaders than
              those submitted by party action. For all practical purposes their choice is limited
              within these narrow lines. It thereby becomes the duty of every citizen to enter some
              political party, and there to consecrate his energy and his judgment in the efforts to
              make its platform, candidates and leaders the most efficient agencies for the public
              good that the people can achieve. It is through these efforts that personal interest
              in public welfare becomes effective. It is through these methods that the generous
              ardor of youth, the deep sense of personal accountability, and the intelligent
              understanding of modern problems, so essential to democratic success, are to be
              translated into terms of practical accomplishment.</p>
            <p>If it be objected that in spite of one's best efforts, his party produces a program
              for popular approval which is inferior to that of its competitor, then as a loyal
              party member he is bound to vote for the inferior program, I must <pb id="VAC1001-320"
                n="308"/>emphatically dissent. It is true that there has been at times a popular
              conception that one must vote the ticket of his party if he has participated in its
              councils, yet such a conception is not based upon a scientific premise. It ignores the
              fact that a party is but a means to an end. It gets the cart before the horse. There
              is no sound public reason why the nation should be sacrificed to party aggrandizement.
              It follows, therefore, that when one has fought the best fight of which he may be
              capable in the party primaries and conventions, and the parties have submitted their
              respective claims to popular approval, that then the conscientious citizen will enter
              the ballot box, not as a partisan, but as an American, and will give the voice of his
              approval to such candidates and to such parties as he believes will best serve the
              public interest. In this method, the contending parties will be continually competing
              for the public confidence and support, and in the interests of partisan success they
              will be compelled to do their utmost for the public good.</p>
            <p>As one considers the momentous problems of to-day and remembers that it is largely
              through the instrumentalities of party government that they must be solved, one may
              well wonder what the end will be. Out of the tragedy and sacrifice of war, there has
              come a feeling of unrest and discontent. In the emergency of the great conflict, the
              government dared not hesitate to pay extravagant prices and permit enormous profits,
              if by so doing additional speed could be secured, for every day that could be saved
              meant the saving of human life. Prices and wages were fixed by governmental decree.
              Extraordinary powers of every kind were exercised on every hand. The result is that
              many ignorant people think that there is unlimited wealth which the public may
              distribute at its wish, if they can but get control of the government. They have a
              naive, superstitious <pb id="VAC1001-321" n="309"/>confidence that the government can
              accomplish wonders if it only will. They are moved to ask for the impossible and to
              threaten revolt and violence if their demands should be refused. The great
              combinations of labor have been influenced by the radical and ignorant members in
              their midst, while some of the representatives of capital, forgetting the real
              significance of the struggle through which the nation has passed, and ignoring the
              basic fact that honest compromise is the basis of democratic achievement, have
              complicated the fundamental problem with their stubbornness and intolerance. The
              rapidly increasing cost of living and the suffering it brings but augments the forces
              of discontent. There are those who decry our institutions and clamor openly for
              revolt.</p>
            <p>Out of these conditions comes a definite challenge to the party leadership and
              achievement. The public must be educated to the real nature of our economic problems.
              The laws governing collective bargaining must be developed so that exact justice may
              be done to either side. The conditions governing the distribution of wealth must be
              carefully considered, and made to correspond with our ideals of decency and justice.
              The laboring man and those dependent upon him must be safeguarded against the needless
              loss of life and limb. The arbitrary power of monopoly must be throttled. Profiteering
              must be effectively prohibited. The ideals of democracy, defended at such an infinite
              sacrifice of blood and treasure against external foes, must be equally protected
              against the enemy from within. Will the people of America meet the challenge? Will
              they demand from their parties, their leaders and their candidates, the just and
              constructive solutions that will endure? Will they seek refuge from the present ills
              in the horror, rapine and brutal impotence of revolution, or in the fearless facing of
                <pb id="VAC1001-322" n="310"/>these conditions and in courageous efforts to provide
              remedies that are adequate and just? Upon this fundamental issue rests the destiny of
              America.</p>

            <head rend="center sc">THE BULWARK OF DEMOCRACY</head>
            <p><hi rend="b">A</hi>S OBSERVED in the preceding chapter, there has come out of the
              sorrow and suffering of war, a dangerous spirit of unrest. Weakened by the strain and
              stress of the great conflict, oppressed with the feeling of injustice and impotence,
              misguided by the wild impossible promises of the revolutionary, there has developed a
              spirit of radicalism that seems to menace our institutions. Motivated by fear of these
              forces, our government has resorted to the deportation of offending aliens who plot
              against our government. Other methods of repression are being advocated and
              occasionally employed. There is danger in these methods of defense. Nothing worse
              could happen than for the public to rely entirely upon such means of protection. For
              they are negative remedies at best, and, moreover, are inconsistent with our
              traditional ideals of political liberty. They remove those whom the contagion has
              affected, but are powerless to prevent its spread. They may perhaps serve well in a
              great emergency, but they offer no adequate protection for the future.</p>
            <p>Such measures will be doubly harmful if they give us a false sense of security or
              blind us to the constructive remedies that are at hand. If the contagion is to be
              arrested in its spread, and prevented in the future, it can only be accomplished by
              the innoculation of the public with the fundamental concepts of liberty and democracy.
              If revolutionary radicalism threatens our peace and safety to-day, it is because our
              institutions and ideals have not been adequately <pb id="VAC1001-325" n="313"
              />understood and loved by those who compose the public. In the life of popular
              government all is necessarily staked upon the nature of the public opinion that
              functions through it. If that public opinion is not grounded in a fundamental
              comprehension and appreciation of the ideals, theories and principles of democracy,
              its foundations are shaky and insecure. It may endure through the ordinary
              vicissitudes of national development, but, subject it to the stress and strain of a
              great war, when intellects and judgments are blinded by prejudice, fear and passion,
              and dissolution is imminent. In such emergencies the only effective bulwark of
              democracy is a virile sentiment of dynamic Americanism, directed and controlled by a
              public opinion that is intelligent, courageous and sincere. Moreover, such opinion
              must be grounded in the deep and abiding conviction of the soundness and justice of
              American ideals.</p>
            <p>In these days of stress, the situation is complicated by the existence of many evils
              and unsolved problems that, in times of peace and plenty, seemed to the superficial to
              be innocent enough, but which are greatly accentuated by the evil circumstances of
              to-day, and afford to the unthinking and the reckless, a plausible basis for their
              futile policy of revolt. Our laxity in dealing with the problems presented by the
              conflicts between capital and labor, affords an excellent example. Most of the
              suffering and privation that this conflict has caused to the nation might have been
              prevented, had we struggled with the problems as they first appeared, seeking to do
              justice to both sides, and avoiding the fatal policy of drift and indifference, which
              has generally continued until the controversy has reached the dimensions of a national
              tragedy.</p>
            <p>A spirit of constructive patriotism would have attacked these problems as they
              developed, and thus avoided many of the aggravating factors in the present conditions
              of unrest. <pb id="VAC1001-326" n="314"/>Moreover, such a patriotic sentiment,
              accompanied by an intelligent public opinion, devoted to the ideals and purposes of
              our democracy, would make America a most uninviting field for revolutionary
              propaganda. Entrenched behind such defenses, our institutions would have little to
              fear from the hostilities of the enemies within our gates. But with vital problems
              left unsolved, with the horrors of unemployment undisturbed, with profiteering
              apparently unrestrained, with the lamentable housing conditions that exist in many
              cities, and with our public opinion uninformed and unconvinced regarding the nature
              and genius of our institutions, we provide alluring possibilities for those who would
              plot our ruin.</p>
            <p>I am not one of those who believes our institutions are in immediate peril. But while
              our national existence is not endangered, our domestic peace and prosperity are
              threatened, and the efficiency and justice of our democracy are impaired. In such a
              period of unrest, public opinion can not operate efficiently and justly upon the
              problems of the day. Fear, hatred and jealousy jeopardize the spirit of national
              unity, bias the popular judgment, and add new points of friction. It becomes
              imperative, therefore, in the interest of a more efficient democracy, to eliminate
              these basic ills.</p>
            <p>The first step must be the prompt solution of our public problems, as rapidly as they
              occur. The public must be trained to apply to these problems the basic ideals of our
              democracy and to demand from our government the translation of these ideals into the
              accomplished facts of constructive statesmanship. We can not afford to ignore
              industrial problems that form the basis of domestic conflicts, until it is forced upon
              public attention by the tragedy of industrial paralysis. If an injustice is being done
              to labor, or the legitimate rights of the employer are being menaced, the public must
              be trained to respond immediately, and to demand the correction of the evil. Moreover,
              our public <pb id="VAC1001-327" n="315"/>officers must be made to feel that back of
              them lies a virile, determined public opinion that opposes the rule of arbitrary might
              in industrial conflict, whether wielded by capital or by labor, but insists that, like
              other domestic controversies, they must be solved by the rule of law, articulating the
              basic principles of industrial justice, and enforced with courage and impartiality.
              This will not be an easy task to essay. It can not be done at once. It will require
              years of study, experimentation and development. But it never will be done until
              demanded by a dynamic, intelligent and sustained opinion of the public.</p>
            <p>What is true here is true of the other problems that are calling for attention, but
              which we need not here enumerate. This means, in the last analysis, that domestic
              peace and tranquillity can be adequately assured only when there can be created a
              dominant sentiment of constructive patriotism to insure the just and prompt solution
              of domestic problems. In the preceding chapters I have tried to indicate how this
              sentiment can be created. We have seen how the sentiment of military patriotism has
              been developed, and what it has meant to the nation in its conflict with foreign foes.
              We have seen how the study of the community, the state and the nation can have a
              dramatic and impelling appeal to the social instincts of the normal boy and girl, if
              we will only teach these subjects as they are, with all their tragic setting and their
              vital, human significance. We have seen how, by opening up new afferent inlets into
              their instinctive dispositions, the bare skeleton of our social and political
              organization became clothed in the flesh and blood of human interest. Likewise, by
              training the efferent part of the psycho-physical disposition until the felt impulse
              to action, arising from the stimulation of the instinct, is directed into useful
              channels of civic action, we have seen how one may soon learn to refresh his spiritual
              and altruistic self with <pb id="VAC1001-328" n="316"/>the thrill of joy that comes
              from noble service splendidly performed, and to seek his happiness in its further
              quest.</p>
            <p>By pursuing these methods throughout the school curriculum, until the receiving of
              stimuli through the new afferent inlets and the exercise of the resulting felt impulse
              to action in an intelligent and effective way, have become habitual, there is
              crystallized a sentiment of dynamic Americanism that will insure a quick and virile
              response to public need.</p>
            <p>This splendid sentiment, with all the emotional power of youth to give it force, can
              be safeguarded against ignorant abuse, and intelligently directed toward effective and
              useful remedies, by training the intellectual habits of the pupil, inculcating a love
              of truth, an evolutionary point of view toward the problems of life, and by developing
              the instinct of curiosity until an aggressive, critical and analytical attitude toward
              public problems becomes habitual. It has been the purpose of this volume to suggest
              helpful methods by which all this could be accomplished, and to demonstrate its
              necessity as the basis of an intelligent, virile and altruistic public opinion,
              without which democracy can not endure.</p>
            <p>The creation of this sentiment and the development of the emotional and intellectual
              resources of the child is not enough. As a by-product of this training, there should
              be developed certain basic convictions regarding the fundamentals of democracy. The
              experience of democratic experiments and the dictates of common sense, indicate that
              there are a few basic principles of democracy that are apparently essential to its
              success. These should be so thoroughly grounded in the thought and life of the child
              that he will not be tempted to depart from them except after the most careful
              scrutiny, and upon the clearest evidence. Two dangers arise at this point, which we
              must be careful to avoid. One is confusing individual opinion over controversial <pb
                id="VAC1001-329" n="317"/>matters and details with fundamental principles. There are
              very few of the latter and to assume that one's opinions are fundamental and amply
              vindicated by the experiences of the race, without the most painstaking study,
              reflection and analysis, is errant bigotry of the most pernicious type.</p>
            <p>The other danger is the tendency to dogmatize. The more obvious and axiomatic a
              principle seems to be, and therefore the more teachable it is, the less we tend to
              teach, and the more we tend to dogmatize. We do not need a public opinion based upon
              blindly accepted dogmas. What we need is a passionate devotion to vital principle, as
              an effective means to a worthy end, and based upon an adequate estimate of its
              inherent worth. The latter is a result of education, the former a product of
              dogmatism. In the latter inhere all the evils of bigotry and the static mind; in the
              former, we have the strength that comes from character and conviction.</p>
            <p>By many it will be argued that the teaching of these principles is unnecessary, if
              not vicious. We are told that if these principles are sound that the public will learn
              them from experience, and if not sound, that they will be misled. But why condemn each
              decade and generation to the same pitfalls and mistakes, in order that they may learn
              in the school of experience what might be better taught in the formal process of
              education. In commerce we seek to generalize so accurately upon the experience of the
              past that we can teach the business man of to-morrow to avoid the pitfalls of
              yesterday. Medical education seeks to save the physician and his patients of the
              future from the vital mistakes of the past. If we insist that medicine and business
              should profit by the experience of the race, why deny the same boon to the struggling
              democracies of the world? If it be argued that democracy learns only by experience, it
              may be answered that the same is true of business, medicine and <pb id="VAC1001-330"
                n="318"/>science. But that does not mean that the student of medicine must
              rediscover for himself, through the wasteful and tedious methods of unguided accident
              and experience, the theories of pathology and the facts of bacteriology. Nor should it
              mean that each generation, under the stress and strain of its peculiar problems,
              should rediscover through accident and experiment, unguided by the experience of the
              race, the value of such concepts as religious liberty or the freedom of the press.</p>
            <p>As this chapter is being written, the public press carries the news that five members
              of a state legislature have been expelled from the assembly because of their political
              beliefs. It is not alleged that there was fraud in their election, or that there was
              legal incapacity for office, but merely that they were Socialists. I hold no brief for
              socialism, but I do contend that such an action evidences a wanton disregard of the
              spirit of toleration and the principles of political liberty. How much better it would
              have been had these legislators learned in their youth, from the history of the past,
              something of the value of political liberty, than for them to rediscover it to-day,
              through this wanton breach of American ideals!</p>
            <p>Among the basic principles that would seem to be essential to the life of a
              democracy, and which ought to be explained and taught until their apparent worth to
              society makes them become a part of the child's philosophy&mdash;a well-grounded
              conviction of his life&mdash;there are four that I desire here to discuss. They have
              all incidentally received more or less consideration in the preceding chapters, but I
              want to restate them here for the sake of special emphasis and orderly arrangement.
              The first principle to be discussed is the principle of national unity. No form of
              popular government can succeed where the people are divided into groups of
              irreconcilables, neither being willing to accept a <pb id="VAC1001-331" n="319"
              />popular mandate, nor to effect an honest compromise. In such a state there can be no
              government by the consent of the governed, but only a government by force. It required
              four long years of civil war, with an immense sacrifice of blood and treasure, before
              America learned the value of this fundamental concept. Nor would the Civil War alone
              have accomplished this important end, had it not been followed by a frank acceptance
              of the results, and a growing spirit of mutual toleration and respect. It is for this
              reason that those who wave the "bloody shirt" and seek to capitalize the waning
              prejudices of sectionalism, deserve only condemnation and contempt. Such appeals
              retard and endanger the spirit of unity.</p>
            <p>The government in the southern states during the carpetbag rule is another excellent
              example. The whites were irreconcilable under the domination of the negro vote, which
              was finally overthrown by methods of questionable legality. Moreover, the governments
              of these states suffer to this day as a result of irreconcilable groups and the
              absence of political unity. Austria-Hungary could never have established an enduring
              republic, because of the utter absence of the spirit and ideals of national unity. The
              inability of the north and south of Ireland to agree upon fundamental questions of
              domestic policy and of home rule, and the unwillingness of either side to compromise,
              or of the minority to accept the mandate of the majority, illustrates the paramount
              importance of a unity of national ideals. The French republic is continually weakened
              by the presence, in its body politic, of a group of irreconcilable royalists, who
              decline to acquiesce in the will of the majority, on the question of democratic
              government.</p>
            <p>The strength of America in the recent war was largely the result of common devotion
              to the ideals our people believed to be involved. The strength of America in the
              future <pb id="VAC1001-332" n="320"/>will likewise depend upon the unity of ideals and
              aspirations that will motivate our people. If we can train our citizens to the
              appreciation of the fundamental ideals of America, to avoid the spirit of intolerance
              and bigotry, and to approach great problems in the spirit of honest compromise, we
              will be laying the foundations of national strength. The present industrial crisis, if
              allowed to develop in its bitterness and heat until our people become more interested
              in the triumph of their group than in the national ideals of justice, will become a
              very real and immediate menace to the public peace. Against such possible
              contingencies we must train our youth to the value and importance of our national
              ideals, in order that there may be developed a devotion to the public weal that will
              make impossible such a fundamental clash between the classes.</p>
            <p>How well this can be accomplished will depend to some extent upon our ability to
              develop a broad spirit of toleration. Should the majority fail to show a fair
              consideration for the legitimate rights of the minority, and proceed to their ruthless
              violation or disregard, it would not take long until national unity would disappear.
              For example, should the majority of the people, by constitutional amendment or
              otherwise, seek to deny the rights of religious liberty to the minority, or deny them
              legitimate freedom of discussion, it is inconceivable that the minority would
              peacefully and voluntarily acquiesce. Innumerable examples might be cited in support
              of this same principle. National unity, therefore, can only be achieved when the
              people are educated to the support of, and belief in, the same great fundamental
              principles of politics and justice, when they can view their conflicting interests in
              the spirit of democratic compromise, and when there is established as a national trait
              a broad and genuine spirit of toleration, and an absence of errant bigotry. The spirit
              of compromise is of the very essence of a <pb id="VAC1001-333" n="321"/>successful
              democracy and the spirit of toleration is essential to the growth of liberty and the
              enjoyment of freedom.</p>
            <p>The school can render no greater service to the public than in impregnating in the
              mind of the nation's youth the vital importance of these matters. The opportunities
              for so doing are abundant. The life and efficiency of every organized group, club,
              church, or community is dependent largely upon these factors for its success. Let two
              irreconcilable factions develop in a club, church or society, and its usefulness for
              the time being is at an end. Let discord and bitterness enter the home, and its charm
              and utility are vitally impaired. Nor is this all. These qualities are not only of
              great social value to the nation, but of great practical value to the individual. Upon
              the possession of these faculties depends one's ability to get on with his fellow men,
              to win their confidence and respect, and to cooperate effectively with his
              associates.</p>
            <p>We have seen the importance of these faculties tragically illustrated in the
              practical politics of the nation. We have seen the determined, organized minority,
              representing the most sinister influences of the nation, winning victory after victory
              because they were agreed upon fundamentals; they knew the value of common effort, and
              they operated with essential unity. Their opponents lacked the unity, the team work
              and the capacity to cooperate. They needed to get down to fundamentals, to accept them
              as the basis of their unity, to be tolerant as to details. Until the forces of
              righteousness can learn these elemental values the forces of wickedness will
              prevail.</p>
            <p>The second principle to be discussed is the theory that orderly development and
              evolution is the most efficient means of progress. This means an intelligent devotion
              to, and confidence in, law and order as opposed to illegal and revolutionary methods.
              I do not mean a blind submission to <pb id="VAC1001-334" n="322"/>established power,
              but the conscious spirit of self-restraint born of the conviction that lawful means
              will insure the largest measure of success. If this spirit of intelligent
              self-restraint and devotion to the principle of orderly development can become a basic
              conviction of our people, we will have erected a mighty barrier against the dangers of
              recklessness and revolt.</p>
            <p>In the preceding chapters the methods of teaching the value of law and order have
              been repeatedly discussed. Splendid opportunities are afforded in the study of all the
              departments of government, in the history of the community, and in the experiences of
              the home. When our public opinion is thoroughly impregnated with this idea and it has
              become a settled and firm conviction of our people, then another bulwark of democracy
              will have been achieved.</p>
            <p>The third principle in which public opinion should be deeply grounded until it has
              become a profound conviction of our people is the basic and sacred importance of
              liberty. In America an appeal for liberty and its proper appreciation may, at first,
              seem superfluous. In fact, it is doubtless the existence of this very feeling that is
              at fault. We all render lip service to the cause of liberty. We all respond with
              splendid patriotic thrills to its eloquent acclaim. We all assume that liberty is an
              established institution, and need not be studied or referred to except in recognition
              or in praise. We, in America, have come to take it all for granted and to forget the
              great price that has been paid by those who have gone before. We forget that with
              every new generation, there arises new evils that menace its vitality. In the work of
              patriotic education incident to the great war it was at first difficult to get the
              public to see that in that great struggle the issue of liberty was involved. They
              seemed to think that liberty and freedom in this enlightened age could no longer be
              imperiled. They seemed to have <pb id="VAC1001-335" n="323"/>forgotten that the
              struggle for liberty is an eternal one. They had forgotten that the aspiration for
              liberty has been the pillar of cloud by day and of light by night that has inspired
              the teeming millions of the world, through all the vicissitudes of their upward
              struggle.</p>
            <p>So accustomed were they to certain liberties that they never stopped to question the
              source from which they came or the means by which they were protected. The freedom and
              opportunity of the child of humble birth to acquire an education and to get into any
              field of business, political or professional endeavor, unfettered by limitations of
              caste, family or law, is so commonplace in America that they forgot that like
              opportunities were not enjoyed to the same fulness or extent in most of the great
              nations of the world. They likewise forgot that as the pressure of population becomes
              greater, our economic life more differentiated, and the pioneer character of our
              civilization disappears, there will arise tendencies toward the economic
              stratification of society which silently, slowly and almost imperceptibly will curtail
              or threaten these liberties and opportunities that we now enjoy.</p>
            <p>The only adequate safeguard against such future ills is an alert and intelligent
              public opinion, thoroughly and eternally committed to the principles of liberty and
              motivated with a passionate devotion to their defense. This conception of the
              importance of liberty will not come automatically. It will not be created by
              occasional rhetoric or the celebration of national holidays. It will come only with
              the patient, careful and thorough instruction of the nation's youth. This should be
              one of the central themes in all study of history and civics. There are few periods,
              epochs or subjects in these lines of study that will not afford opportunities of
              bringing home, in new and dramatic form, the marvelous importance of liberty, the
              incessant struggle that must <pb id="VAC1001-336" n="324"/>always go on in its behalf,
              and its basic importance to human welfare. The child must have this brought home to
              him time and time again, until it is no longer a mere formally accepted dogma of
              American politics, but a vital conviction of his life, an inherent part of his moral
              and intellectual equipment.</p>
            <p>Out of such a conception must come not only the right and duty to defend one's
              liberties, but also the duty to respect the like liberties of others. It is a common
              mistake in democracies to dwell upon their rights and gently but surely to ignore
              their duties. There is not so much danger that our people will too easily acquiesce in
              the loss of liberties as that some of our people may forget to recognize and respect
              the liberty of others. Well-meaning reformers, in their eagerness to remedy obvious
              evils, have been moved to the advocacy of measures subversive of liberty, and savoring
              strongly of tyrannical control. A very distinguished student of the housing problem,
              in his anxiety to see that the housing statutes were rigidly enforced, proposed a
              system of state inspection in which public inspectors would have authority to enter
              and inspect the homes of those living in the tenements, at any hour of day or night.
              It was proposed that such inspection should be made frequently and at all hours of the
              twenty-four. Such a bureaucratic system of espionage, carried into the private life of
              the home, shows a lack of perspective and a dangerous willingness to violate a very
              fundamental principle of free government. I have only admiration for those who are
              giving their time and energy to dealing with the difficulties presented by the housing
              problems of our cities, but I insist that a due regard for the fundamental rights of
              democracy would find some other method of enforcement more consistent with a decent
              regard for individual liberty.</p>
            <p>In dealing with the colored race, and with alien residents, <pb id="VAC1001-337"
                n="325"/>we have shown a disposition at times to resort to acts of tyranny and to
              outrage private rights in a brutal and savage way. In 1889 the council of a western
              city passed an ordinance creating a Chinese district and providing that all Chinese
              must, within sixty days, move their business and homes to the district specified, or
              away from the city and county, and providing punishment for those who failed to move
              within the allotted time. This act applied to over twenty thousand of the Chinese
              race, some of whom were American citizens, and some of whom had owned their homes and
              businesses for thirty to forty years. Under the terms of this ordinance these persons
              were compelled to leave these places within sixty days and to move to a designated and
              restricted place, where they would be forced to pay whatever might be exacted of them
              by the real estate speculators who had them at their mercy. There was no alternative.
              It was not contended that these people were criminal, but only that they were of
              Chinese descent. The ordinance sounds more like a brutal decree of the Turkish
              government dealing with the helpless Armenians, than a municipal ordinance in a great
              democracy. Any city that could impose such an ordinance, or any public opinion that
              could view it with equanimity, has no real conviction as to the principles of liberty.
              Fortunately, we have a Constitution that prohibits such acts of majority tyranny, and
              under that Constitution the courts held the ordinance to be void. But it was only the
              wisdom of the framers of the constitutional provision that saved the situation.</p>
            <p>Like ordinances have been passed dealing with the colored population, while other
              laws discriminating against them, both as to their personal and political rights, have
              been not infrequently invoked. The prevalence of terrorism and mob violence, in many
              cases involving members of the negro race, affords still other examples of where
              popular passion, <pb id="VAC1001-338" n="326"/>race prejudice, or other factors have
              proved to be greater than our respect for law and our veneration for liberty. To deny
              to one accused of crime, the constitutional rights of a fair impartial trial by a jury
              of his peers, and to leave him to the mercies of an infuriated mob, is not only an act
              of savage barbarism, but the grossest violation of one's most sacred right of life and
              liberty. And yet these things occur and they occur in almost every state in the Union.
              I do not wish to ignore the difficulties presented by the negro problem, nor do I wish
              to offer any suggestion for its solution, but I do wish to submit that the violation
              of the plainest conceptions of liberty and constitutional government, not only affords
              no constructive solution to this intricate problem, but that it does dull the popular
              ideas of liberty, and to that extent it jeopardizes the very foundations of our
              democracy. The existence of these evils demonstrates the imperative need of a clearer
              conception of the meaning of liberty, and a deeper devotion to its defense.</p>
            <p>The examples above indicated will afford striking illustrations to the students of
              the present need of a devotion to liberty and the serious consequences of its loss. We
              need to think of liberty and freedom in the terms of modern life. We need to study it
              as a basic concept of efficient democracy. We need to vitalize it by applying it in
              the light of the realities of to-day. For only out of this process will come an
              adequate understanding of its importance and a sincere devotion to its ideal.</p>
            <p>In developing such a conviction as the common possession of our people, we are at the
              same time laying the foundation for a better spirit of national unity. As previously
              observed, the basis of such a spirit must be found in a common devotion to common
              ideals that are fundamental and basic. Nothing can do this better than by making the
              cause of liberty and freedom, in a real and vital sense, the <pb id="VAC1001-339"
                n="327"/>common cause of our nation. Its appeal to the imagination and the emotions
              is marvelous, while its predominant place in the nation's history makes it peculiarly
              appropriate. Moreover, it becomes an additional barrier against those forces of
              bigotry, prejudice and recklessness that occasionally threaten our domestic peace. The
              spirit of unity is not likely to suffer greatly unless complicated by some tyrannous
              violation of the legitimate liberty of a minority. And that becomes less likely to
              just the extent that a deep and abiding conviction of the essential importance of
              liberty permeates the body politic.</p>
            <p>Take for instance the difficult question of the freedom of speech. When the public
              becomes aroused as in times of war, it is too easy for the great majority, with the
              best of intentions, to destroy ruthlessly the rights of the minority. In times of
              stress and strain such as the present, there is an element in the country crying for
              the suppression of those who argue for revolution, and against our forms of
              government. No greater mistake could be made than to rely upon such repression for the
              national safety. Our safety must rest in the sound judgment and the sane convictions
              of our people, and not in their silent but ignorant acquiescence. We must develop a
              form of government and a type of democracy that will flourish amidst the babel of
              revolutionary tongues or we are lost. Give to the minority their full freedom of
              expression, and the decisions of the majority become more safe, more intelligent, and
              more just, and the minority becomes more ready to acquiesce in the mandates of the
              majority. But deny to the minority the rights of free and fair discussion, and the
              rule of the majority becomes less generous, less well considered, and less
              intelligent, while the minority are driven to irreconcilable sullenness or revolt.
              Freedom of discussion is the best safety valve for the pent-up anger of
              minorities.</p>
            <pb id="VAC1001-340" n="328"/>
            <p>A prominent student of German politics and government has recently observed that had
              the German people enjoyed but one liberty denied them, the great war and the wicked
              philosophy that prompted it never would have happened. That liberty was the liberty of
              discussion. He stated that there were thinkers in Germany who took a liberal attitude
              toward the question of imperialism, expansion and world affairs, but the moment one of
              them would secure a following, he was denied the medium of expression. The moment the
              peace societies began to apply their theories to German politics, they met with
              effective opposition. The great majority of the people of Germany were educated in a
              system of public schools where the ideas taught were subject to the most vigorous
              supervision, and the people trained to a philosophy of force and the doctrine of the
              superman, which made them the fit instruments of imperialistic ambition. This,
              together with an absence of freedom of discussion, by which those who saw the mistake
              of their national philosophy might be prevented from converting others, made the
              ruling class the supreme arbiters over the destinies of their people. No more dramatic
              illustration of the evils resulting from the suppression of freedom of discussion
              could be desired. What we need in America is not the national unity that is "made in
              Germany," through dogmatism dictated by autocratic power, but a sense of unity and
              strength that comes from a common conviction as to the value of liberty, a conviction
              that springs from the free life and thought of a virile and independent race.</p>
            <p>In opposing suppressive measures against those who argue in favor of revolt, I do not
              wish to be misunderstood. I have no sympathy with those who would capitalize the
              ignorance, the cupidity and the prejudice of the people and who seek to lead them
              through the perilous and barren wastes of revolution, in the search of a new régime
              existing <pb id="VAC1001-341" n="329"/>only in the realms of their imagination.
              Whether such leaders are found among the soap-box orators or the parlor bolshevists of
              the intellectually elite, they deserve only condemnation and distrust. But no free
              people can afford to rob them of their liberty of speech so long as it bears no direct
              relation to lawless violence. For a people that is careless of violating liberty in
              one case will be more careless in the next. The security of our liberty, in the last
              analysis, is dependent on the firm convictions of our people. If that conviction be
              shaken, or its observance be ignored, our freedom is insecure.</p>
            <p>The fourth great principle of democracy that ought to be inculcated in the minds of
              our people, is the theory of democratic duty. As indicated in a preceding chapter, one
              of the worst evils of our democratic philosophy is that it is generally expressed in
              terms of the rights of the individual. Accordingly, there has developed in connection
              with it, a negative rather than a positive theory of political ethics. So long as we
              avoid the positive invasion of the rights of the individual, our consciences tend to
              be calm and satisfied. Through our indifference we may be denying life and health to
              thousands whom it is the mission of democracy to serve, but we never mind. Millions of
              our citizens have lived in contentment and ease with detailed knowledge of the evils
              of child labor and never raised a protesting hand. Millions are aware that every year
              scores of our citizens lose their lives through the lawlessness of mobs, and yet they
              scarcely rise to protest, although they alone can prevent these awful crimes.</p>
            <p>Our whole theory of democracy and government is at fault. We regard government and
              democracy as something separate and independent from ourselves, against which we can
              claim the most exacting rights, but to which we owe nothing save obedience and taxes.
              The facts are that <pb id="VAC1001-342" n="330"/>modern government is nothing but a
              cooperative enterprise in which the people unite for the joint solution of those
              problems which they can not solve alone. For every right there is a corresponding duty
              resting not only upon the government, but upon the people who function through the
              government, and whose cooperative enterprise it is. If a child has a right to normal
              childhood, education and physical fitness for the duties and conflicts of life, then
              it becomes the sacred duty of the people to see that their government gives and
              protects such rights. If it be admitted that one has a right to be tried by due
              process of law before forfeiting his life as a penalty for an alleged offense, then it
              becomes the duty of the citizen to see that such basic rights are granted, and when
              indifferent citizens tolerate the rule of mobs, the mark of Cain belongs upon their
              brows. If one is entitled to a just and expeditious settlement of such disputes as
              arise in our courts of justice, then it becomes the duty of the individual so to use
              his political power as to secure this worthy end. No one can admit the existence of a
              right in a democratic nation, without accepting a corresponding duty regarding its
              fulfillment. That duty arises from the very nature of democracy, and yet it has not
              found an abiding place among the convictions of our people.</p>
            <p>The eagerness of the average voter to find illusive alibis for corruption and
              inefficiency in government, is abundant evidence of this fact. Corruption, ignorance
              in public office, terrible and costly inefficiency, the ravages of industrial disease,
              the annual toll of the "white man's plague"&mdash;these and countless other tragedies
              of to-day are witnessed by the public in a complacent ease which emphatically
              negatives any adequate sense of personal accountability or blame. Much of the
              preceding chapters has been devoted to analyzing these situations, and to suggesting
              means of bringing home, in the individual case, a sense of personal <pb
                id="VAC1001-343" n="331"/>responsibility. From these and the many other
              illustrations that the study of our local and national life affords, this sense of
              personal blame must be driven home, time and time again, accompanied with an adequate
              explanation of the cooperative nature of democracy, until it becomes habitual, and, by
              continued repetition, is translated into the thought, the character and the
              convictions of the child. All of these illustrations will contain rich possibilities
              of appeal to instinctive and emotional life, and the response to these, when
              intelligently directed, will give to the child that generous joy and spiritual
              exaltation that comes to those who serve in a noble and worthy cause. With the
              development of this conviction, the citizen is ethically equipped to play a worthy
              part in the life of our democracy.</p>
            <p>In a recent meeting of advanced university students, a spirited debate developed
              between the conservatives and the radicals regarding certain domestic policies and
              institutions. The radicals challenged every institution, every fundamental principle
              of the Republic, and the very essentials of constitutional government itself. The
              conservatives came valiantly to the defense, but they were miserably defeated at every
              point in the argument. No sooner would one of them take a stand than he would find
              himself forced into an embarrassing alternative or dilemma from which he seemed
              powerless to extricate himself. Subsequent experience showed that many converts had
              been won to the cause of radicalism, or had lost their confidence in the value of
              existing institutions. This was not due to the fact that the radicals were always
              right. It was not due to the fact that the evidence and logic were on their side. It
              was not due to the invincible character of their position which was frequently
              impossible, and occasionally absolutely negatived by the most obvious facts of
              history. The difficulty was that the defenders of American institutions and ideals
              were <pb id="VAC1001-344" n="332"/>not prepared for their defense. It was painfully
              evident that many of them had never before given a moment's consideration to their
              basic implications. They had accepted them as correct. They had taken them as a matter
              of course. To them American ideals and principles did not represent deeply-rooted
              conviction, slowly crystallized through years of careful thought and study, but the
              lightly-accepted dogmas of tradition or prejudice. They were not aware that back of
              them lay the accumulated experiences of the ages. They did not see in them the great
              principles of human progress that had been evolved through centuries of trial and
              error, of costly bloodshed, and of bitter conflict.</p>
            <p>Their opponents were clever, ingenious and remorseless. Thrilled with the joy of the
              iconoclast, stimulated by the spirit of adventure and discovery and unrestrained by
              the judgment of maturity or an adequate background of historical knowledge, they found
              the paths of radicalism alluringly heroic and refreshingly new and virile. Of
              inquiring or contentious temperament, they found them intellectually interesting and
              forensically productive. Consequently they were prepared to defend their views and to
              win a victory by the intellectual default of their opponents.</p>
            <p>The illustration is typical. It explains the growth of radicalism among the
              intellectually inclined. It explains the great influences frequently wielded by the
              radicals who are so few in number. Its moral is clear. Radicalism is dangerous in a
              democracy only when the people are uninstructed in its basic theories and uncommitted
              to its ideals. Such seeds of discontent will come to fruitage only when cast upon soil
              prepared by ignorance and nurtured by justifiable discontent. But let the people be
              grounded in the fundamental theories of democracy, let them be drawn together in that
              spirit of national unity that comes from a community of convictions and ideals, let
              them be committed to the policy <pb id="VAC1001-345" n="333"/>of self-restraint and
              orderly progress as the most effective method of achievement, let them worship at the
              shrine of liberty with sincerity and devotion, and finally, let them accept the
              doctrine of personal accountability for governmental performance, and the nation need
              fear but little.</p>
            <p>A distinguished citizen from England, in a recent address to an American audience,
              related the incident of a grave mistake made by the British prime minister in a recent
              emergency. It looked for a time as if the results would be disastrous. But with almost
              unerring instinct, the British people refused to follow their leader, popular and
              successful as he had been, in this particular affair, and the disaster was averted.
              They were so well grounded in their convictions, so deeply attached to certain basic
              ideals that when their leader, mistaken under the stress of the moment, went astray,
              they refused to follow.</p>
            <p>I believe it to be the mission of the schools and the ideal of Americanism, to create
              a public opinion so intelligent in its understanding of democracy, so deeply devoted
              to the ideals of America, and so firmly impregnated with the principles of liberty,
              that though we suffer from mistaken leadership, though we be attacked by foreign
              powers, though we be subjected to the strain of famine, pestilence or industrial
              panic, though we be fought by domestic foes, that America will emerge triumphant
              because of the justice, the courage, the ideals and the character of her people. It is
              in the possession of these national and basic traits that we will find the true
              bulwark of democracy.</p>
