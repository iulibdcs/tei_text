                    <head type="subtitle">(Taken from the notes of the late John Paradiso)</head>
                    <p>I HAVE lived now to my fortieth year, and have seen a good deal of life. Just
                        now, because of a stretch of poverty, I am living across the river from New
                        York, in New Jersey, in sight of a splendid tower, the Woolworth Building on
                        the lower end of Manhattan, which lifts its defiant spear of clay into the
                        very maw of heaven. And although I am by no means as far from it as is Fifth
                        Avenue, still I am a dweller in one of the shabbiest, most forlorn
                        neighborhoods which the great metropolis affords. About me dwell principally
                        Poles and Hungarians, who palaver in a lingo of which I know nothing and who
                        live as I would despise to live, poor as I am. For, after all, in my
                        hall-bedroom, which commands the river over the lumberyard, there is some
                        attempt at intellectual adornment, whereas outside and around me there is
                        little more than dull and to a certain extent aggrieved drudgery.</p>
                    <p>Not so very far from me is a church, a great yellow structure which lifts its
                        walls out of a ruck of cheap frame houses, and those muddy, unpaved streets
                        which are the pride of Jersey City and Hoboken. Here, if I will, I can hear
                        splendid masses intoned, see bright altars and stained glass windows and
                        people going to confession and burning votive candles before images. And if
                        I go of a Sunday, which I rarely do, I can hear regularly that there is a
                        Christ who died for men, and <pb id="VAA2441-011" n="2"/> that He was the
                        son of the living God who liveth and reigneth world without end.</p>
                    <p>I have no quarrel with this doctrine. I can hear it in a hundred thousand
                        churches throughout the world. But I am one of those curious persons who
                        cannot make up their minds about anything. I read and read, almost
                        everything that I can lay hands onhistory, politics, philosophy, art. But I
                        find that one history contradicts another, one philosopher drives out
                        another. Essayists, in the main, point out flaws and paradoxes in the
                        current conception of things; novelists, dramatists and biographers spread
                        tales of endless disasters, or silly illusions concerning life, duty, love,
                        opportunity and the like. And I sit here and read and read, when I have
                        time, wondering.</p>
                    <p>For, friends I am a scrivener by tradeor try to be. Betimes, trying to make
                        up my mind what to say about life, I am a motorman on a street-car at three
                        dollars and twenty cents a day. I have been a handy man in a junk shop, and
                        wagon driver, anything you will, so long as thereby I could keep body and
                        soul together. I am not handsome, and therefore not attractive to women
                        probablyat any rate I appear not to beand in consequence am very much alone.
                        Indeed, I am a great coward when it comes to women. Their least frown or
                        mood of indifference frightens me and makes me turn inward to myself, where
                        dwell innumerable beautiful women who smile and nod and hang on my arm and
                        tell me they love me. Indeed, they whisper of scenes so beautiful and so
                        comforting that I know they are not, and never could be, true. And so, in my
                        best moments, I sit at my table and try to write stories which no doubt
                        equally necessitous editors find wholly unavailable.</p>
                    <p>The things which keep me thinking and thinking are, first, my social and
                        financial state; second, the difference between my point of view and that of
                        thousands of other respectable citizens, who, being able to make up their
                        minds, seem to find <pb id="VAA2441-012" n="3"/> me queer, dull, recessive,
                        or at any rate unsuited to their tastes and pleasures. I look at them, and
                        while I say, &quot;Well, thank heaven I am not like that,&quot;
                        still I immediately ask myself, &quot;Am I not all wrong? Should I not
                        be happier if I, too, were like John Spitovesky, or Jacob Feilchenfeld, or
                        Vaclav Melka?&quot;some of my present neighbors. For Spitovesky, to grow
                        a little personal, is a small dusty man who has a tobacco store around the
                        corner, and who would, I earnestly believe, run if he were threatened with a
                        bath. He smokes his own three-for-fives (Flor de Sissel Grass), and deposits
                        much of the ashes between his waistcoat and his gray striped cotton shirt.
                        His hair, sticking bushily out over his ears, looks as though it were
                        heavily peppered with golden snuff.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr Spitovesky,&quot; I said to him one day not long since,
                        &quot;have you been reading anything about the Colorado mining
                        troubles?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never read de papers,&quot; he said with a shrug of his
                        shoulder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No? Not at all?&quot; I pursued.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dere is nodding in demlies mosdly. Somedimes I look ad de baseball
                        news in sommer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; I said hopelessly. Then, apropos of nothing,
                        or because I was curious as to my neighbors, &quot;Are you a
                        Catholic?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I doaned belong to no church. I doaned mix in no politics, neider.
                        Some hof de men aboud here get excided aboud politics; I got no time. I
                        &apos;tend to mine store.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Seeing him stand for hours against his doorpost, or sitting out front smoking
                        while his darksome little wife peels potatoes or sews or fusses with the
                        children, I could never understand his &quot;I got no
                        time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In a related sense there are my friends Jacob Feichenfeld and Vaclav Melka,
                        whom I sometimes envy because they are so different. The former, the butcher
                        to whom I run for chops <pb id="VAA2441-013" n="4"/> and pigs&apos; feet
                        for my landlady, Mrs. Wscrinkuus; the latter the keeper of a spirituous
                        emporium whose windows read &quot;Vynas, Scnapas.&quot; Jacob, like
                        every other honest butcher worthy the name, is broad and beefy. He turns on
                        me a friendly eye as he inquires, &quot;About so thick?&quot; or
                        suggests that he has some nice fresh liver or beef tongue, things which he
                        knows Mrs. Wscrinkuus likes. I can sum up Mr. Feilchenfeld&apos;s
                        philosophy of life when I report that to every intellectual advance I make
                        he exclaims in a friendly enough way, &quot;I dunno,&quot; or
                        &quot;I ain&apos;t never heard about dot.&quot;</p>
                    <p>My pride in a sturdy, passive acceptance of things, however, is nearly
                        realized in Vaclav Melka, the happy dispenser of &quot;Vynas,
                        Scnapsas.&quot; He also is frequently to be found leaning in his doorway
                        in summer, business being not too brisk during the daytime, surveying the
                        world with a reflective eye. He is dark, stocky, black-haired, black-eyed, a
                        good Pole with a head like a wooden peg, almost flat at the top, and driven
                        firmly albeit not ungracefully into his shoulders. He has a wife who is a
                        slattern and nearly a slave, and three children who seem to take no
                        noticeable harm from this saloon life. Leaning in coatless ease against his
                        sticky bar of an evening, he has laid down the law concerning morals and
                        ethics, thus: no lying or stealingamong friends; no brawling or assaults or
                        murdering for any save tremendous reasons of passion; no truckling to
                        priests or sisters who should mind their own business.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you ever read a book, Melka?&quot; I once asked him. It was
                        apropos of a discussion as to a local brawl.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Once. It was about a feller wot killed a woman. Mostly I
                        ain&apos;t got no time to read. Once I was a bath-rubber, and I had time
                        then, but that was long ago. Books ain&apos;t nutting for
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Melka states, however, that he was a fool to come here. &quot;A feller
                        wanted me to take dis saloon, and here I am. I <pb id="VAA2441-014" n="5"/>
                        make a living. If my wife died I would go back to my old job, I
                        think.&quot; He does not want his wife to die, I am sure. It does not
                        make that much difference.</p>
                    <p>But over the river from all this is another picture which disturbs me even
                        more than my present surroundings, because, as seen from here, it is
                        seemingly beautiful and inviting. Its tall walls are those of a fabled city.
                        I can almost hear the tinkle of endless wealth in banks, the honks of
                        automobiles, the fanfare of a great constructive trade life. At night all
                        its myriad lights seem to wink at me and exclaim, &quot;Why so
                        incompetent? Why so idle, so poor? Why live in such a wretched neighborhood?
                        Why not cross over and join the great gay throng, make a successful way for
                        yourself? Why sit aside from this great game of materiality and pretend to
                        ignore it or to feel superior?&quot;</p>
                    <p>And as I sit and think, so it seems to me. But, alas, I haven&apos;t the
                        least faculty for making money, not the least. Plainly beyond are all these
                        wonderful things which are being done and made by men with that kind of
                        ability which I appear to lack. I have no material, constructive sense. I
                        can only think and write, in a way. I see these vast institutions (there are
                        great warehouses on this side, too) filled to overflowing apparently with
                        the financially interested and capable, but II have not the least idea how
                        to do anything likewise. Yet I am not lazy. I toil over my stories or bounce
                        out of bed and hurry to my work of a morning. But I have never earned more
                        than thirty-five dollars a week in my whole life. No, I am not brilliant
                        financially.</p>
                    <p>But the thing that troubles me most is the constant palaver going on in the
                        papers and everywhere concerning right, truth, duty, justice, mercy and the
                        like, things which I do not find expressed very clearly in my own motives
                        nor in the motives of those immediately about me; and also the apparently
                        earnest belief on the part of ever so many editors, authors, social <pb
                            id="VAA2441-015" n="6"/> reformers, et cetera, that every person,
                        however weak or dull-appearing externally, contains within himself the seed
                        or the mechanism for producing endless energy and ability, providing he can
                        only be made to realize that he has it. In other words we are all Napoleons,
                        only we don&apos;t know it. We are lazy Napoleons, idle Hannibals,
                        wasteful and indifferent John D. Rockefellers, Turn the pages of any
                        magazineare there not advertisements of and treatises on How To Be
                        Successful, with the authors thereof offering to impart their knowledge of
                        how so to be for a comparative song?</p>
                    <p>Well, I am not one who can believe that. In my very humble estimation people
                        are not so. They are, in the main, as I see it weak and limited, exceedingly
                        so, like Vaclav Melka or Mrs. Wscrinkuus, and to fill their humble brains
                        with notions of an impossible supremacy, if it could be done, would be to
                        send them forth to breast the ocean in a cockleshell. And, yet, here on my
                        table, borrowed from the local library for purposes of idle or critical
                        examination, is a silly book entitled &quot;Take It!&quot;
                        &quot;It&quot; meaning &quot;<hi rend="i">the
                        world</hi>!&quot;; and another &quot;It&apos;s
                        Yours!&quot;the &quot;It&quot; in this case meaning that same
                        great world! All you have to do is to decide so to doand to try! Am I a fool
                        to smile at this very stout doctrine, to doubt whether you can get more than
                        four quarts out of any four-quart measure, if so much?</p>
                    <p>But to return to this same matter of right, truth, justice, mercy, so freely
                        advertised in these days and so clearly defined, apparently, in every
                        one&apos;s mind as open paths by which they may proceed. In the main, it
                        seems to me that people are not concerned about right, or truth, or justice,
                        or mercy, or duty, as abstract principles or working rules, nor do I believe
                        that the average man knows clearly or even semi-clearly what is meant by the
                        words. His only relation to them, so far as I can see, is that he finds them
                        used in a certain reckless, thoughtless way to represent some method of
                        adjustment <pb id="VAA2441-016" n="7"/> by which he would like to think he
                        is protected from assault or saved from misery, and so uses them himself.
                        His concern for them as related to the other individual is that the other
                        individual should not infringe on him, and I am now speaking of the common
                        unsuccessful mass as well as of the successful.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Wscrinkuus, poor woman, is stingy and slightly suspicious, although she
                        goes to church Sundays and believes that Christ&apos;s Sermon on the
                        Mount is the living truth. She does not want any one to be mean to her; she
                        does not do anything mean to other people, largely because she has no
                        particular taste or capacity in that direction. Supposing I should advise
                        her to &quot;Take It!&quot; assure her that &quot;It&quot;
                        was hers by right of capability! What would become of <hi rend="i">right,
                            truth, justice, mercy</hi> in that case?</p>
                    <p>Or, once more, let us take Jacob Feilchenfeld and John Spitovesky, who care
                        for no man beyond their trade and whose attitude toward right, truth, mercy,
                        justice is as above. Suppose I should tell them to take
                        &quot;It,&quot; or assure them that &quot;It&quot; was
                        theirs? Of what import would the message be? Vaclav Melka does favors only
                        in return for favors. He does not like priests because they are always
                        taking up collections. If you told him to take &quot;It&quot; he
                        would proceed to take something away from the very good priests first of
                        all. Everywhere I find the common man imbued with this feeling for
                        self-protection and self-advancement. <hi rend="i">Truth</hi> is something
                        that must be told to <hi rend="i">him; justice</hi> is what <hi rend="i"
                            >he</hi> deservesalthough if it costs him nothing he will gladly see it
                        extended to the other fellow.</p>
                    <p>But do not think for one moment because I say this that I think myself better
                        or more deserving or wiser than any of these. As I said before, I do not
                        understand life, although I like it; I may even say that I like this sharp,
                        grasping scheme of things, and find that it works well. Plainly it produces
                            <pb id="VAA2441-017" n="8"/> all the fine spectacles I see. If it had
                        not been for a certain hard, seeking ambition in Mr. Woolworth to get up and
                        be superior to his fellows, where would his splendid tower have come from?
                        It is only because I cannot understand why people cling so fatuitously to
                        the idea that there is some fixed idyllic scheme or moral order handed down
                        from on high, which is tender and charitable, punishes so-called evil and
                        always rewards so-called good, that I write this. If it punishes evil, it is
                        not all of the evil that I see. If it rewards good, then much of the good
                        that I admire goes wholly unrewarded, on this earth at least.</p>
                    <p>But to return. The Catholics believe that Christ died on the Cross for them,
                        and that unless the Buddhists, Shintoists, Mohammedans, et cetera, reform or
                        find Christ they will be lost. Three hundred million Mohammedans believe
                        quite otherwise. Two hundred and fifty million Buddhists believe something
                        else. The Christian Scientists and Hicksites believe still differently. Then
                        there are historians who doubt the authenticity of Christ (Gibbon; Vol. I,
                        Chapters 15, 16). Where is a moral order which puts a false interpretation
                        on history as in the case of sectarian literature (lists furnished on
                        application), or allows fetiches to flourish like the grass of the new
                        year?</p>
                    <p>I will admit that in cases such as lying, stealing and the like there is
                        always a so-called moral thing to do or say when these so-called moral
                        principles or beatitudes are inveighed against. You have ridden on a
                        street-car; pay your fare. You have received five dollars from a given man;
                        return it. You have had endless favors from a given individual; do not
                        malign him. Such are the obvious and commonplace things with which these
                        great words are concerned; and in these prima facie cases these so-called
                        principles work well enough.</p>
                    <p>But take a case where temperament or body-needs or appetites fly in the face
                        of man-made order, where a great spirit-thirst stands out against a
                        life-made conviction. Here is a <pb id="VAA2441-018" n="9"/> man-made law,
                        and here is dire necessity. On which side is Right? On which side God?</p>
                    <p>(1) A girl falls in love with a boy to whom the father takes an instant
                        dislike. The father is not better than the lover, just different The girl
                        and boy are aflame (no chemical law of their invention, mind you), and when
                        the father opposes them they wed secretly. Result, rage. A weak temperament
                        on the part of the father (no invention of his own) causes him to drink. On
                        sight, in liquor, he kills the youth. The law says he must be hung unless
                        justified. A lie on the part of the girl defaming the lover-husband will
                        save the father. On which side now do right, truth, justice, mercy
                        stand?</p>
                    <p>(2) A man has a great trade idea. He sees where by combining fourteen
                        companies he can reduce cost of manufacture and sell a very necessary
                        product to the public at a reduced rate, the while he makes himself rich. In
                        the matter of principle and procedure (right, truth, justice, etc.), since
                        his competitors will not sell out, he is confronted by the following
                        propositions: (a) forming a joint stock company and permitting them all to
                        share in the profits; (b) giving them the idea, asking nothing, and allowing
                        them to form a company of their own, so helping humanity; (c) making a
                        secret combination with four or five and underselling the others and so
                        compel them to sell or quit; (d) doing nothing, letting time and chance work
                        and the public wait. Now it so happens that the second and fourth are the
                        only things that can be done without opposition. He is a man of brains and
                        ideals. What are his rights, duties, privileges? Where do justice, mercy,
                        truth, fit in here, and how?</p>
                    <p>(3) A man&apos;s son has committed a crime. The man realizes that owing
                        to deficiencies of his own he has never been able to give the boy a right
                        training or a fair chance. The law demands that he give up his son, even
                        though he loves him dearly and feels himself responsible. Where do right,
                        justice, mercy <pb id="VAA2441-019" n="10"/> work here, and can they be made
                        harmonious and consonant?</p>
                    <p>These are but three of fifty instances out of the current papers which I
                        daily read. I have cited them to show how topsy-turvy the world seems to me,
                        how impossible of a fixed explanation or rule. Scarcely any two individuals
                        but will be at variance on these propositions. Yet the religionists, the
                        moralists, the editorial writers preach a faith and an obvious line of duty
                        which they label grandiosely &quot;right&quot; or
                        &quot;true,&quot; &quot;just&quot; or
                        &quot;merciful.&quot; My observation and experience lead me to
                        believe that there is scarcely a so-called &quot;same,&quot; right,
                        merciful, true, just, solution to anything. I know that many will cry in
                        answer &quot;Look at all this great world! Look at all the interesting
                        things made, the beautiful things, the pleasures provided. Are not these the
                        intelligent directive product of a superior governing being, who is kind and
                        merciful into the bargain and who has our interests at heart? Can you doubt,
                        when you observe the exact laws that govern in mathematics, chemistry,
                        physics, that there is an intelligent, kindly ruling power, truthful,
                        merciful, etc?&quot; My answer is: I can and do, for these things can be
                        used as readily against right, truth, justice, mercy, as we understand those
                        things, as they can for or with them. If you don&apos;t believe this,
                        and are anti-German or anti-Japanese, or anti-anything else, see how those
                        or any other so-called inimical powers can use all these magnificent forces
                        or arts in its behalf and against the powers of light and worth such as you
                        understand and approve of. And when justice and mercy are tacked on as
                        attributes of this intelligence there is no possible appeal to <hi rend="i"
                            >human</hi> reason.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But only look,&quot; some one is sure to cry, &quot;at some
                        of the beautiful, wonderful, helpful things which Divine Providence, or
                        Life, or Force, or Energy has provided now and here for man! Railroads;
                        telegraphy; the telephone; theaters; gas; electricity; clothing of all
                        sorts; newspapers; books; hotels; <pb id="VAA2441-020" n="11"/> stores; fire
                        departments; hospitals; plumbing; the pleasures of love and sex;
                        music.&quot; An admirable list, truly, and all provided by one
                        struggling genius or another or by the slow, cataclysmic processes of
                        nature: fires, deaths and painful births. Aside from the fact that all of
                        these things can be and are used for <hi rend="i">evil</hi> as well as <hi
                            rend="i">good</hi> purposes (trust oppression, enemy wars and the like),
                        still it might as well be supplemented by such things as jails, detectives,
                        penitentiaries, courts of lawgood or evil things, as you choose to look at
                        them. All of these things are good in the hands of good people, evil in the
                        hands of the evil, and nature seems not to care which group uses them. A
                        hospital will aid a scoundrel as readily as a good man, and vice versa.</p>
                    <p>Common dust swept into our atmosphere makes our beautiful sunsets and blue
                        sky. Sidereal space, as we know it, is said to be one welter of strangely
                        flowing streams of rock and dust, a wretched mass made attractive only by
                        some vast compulsory coalition into a star. Stars clash and blaze, and the
                        whole great complicated system seems one erosive, chaffering, bickering
                        effort, with here and there a tendency to stillness and petrifaction. This
                        world as we know it, the human race and the accompanying welter of animals
                        and insects, do they not, aside from momentary phases of delight and beauty,
                        often strike you as dull, aimless, cruel, useless? Are not the processes by
                        which they are produced or those by which they live (the Chicago
                        slaughter-houses, for instance), stark, relentless, brutal, shameful

                    <p>But I was talking of Jersey City and my difficulty in adjusting myself to the
                        life about me, thinking as I do. Yet such facts as I can gather only
                        confound me the more. Take the daily papers which I have been reading to
                        beguile my loneliness, and note that:</p>

                    <p>(1) Two old people who lived near me. after working hard for years to supply
                        themselves with a competence, were ruined by the failure of a bank and were
                        therefore forced to seek work. Not finding it, they were compelled to make a
                        choice between subsisting on charity and dying. Desiring to be as agreeable
                        to the world as possible and not to be a burden to it, they chose death by
                        gas, locking the doors of their bare little home, stuffing paper and
                        clothing into chinks and under doors and windows, and turning on the gas,
                        seated side-by-side and hand-in-hand. Naturally the end came quickly enough,
                        for Divine Mind has no objection to ordinary illuminating gas killing any
                        one. It did not inform any one of their predicament. Impartial gas choked
                        them as quickly as it would have lighted the room, and yet at the same time,
                        according to the same papers, in this very same world</p>
                    <p>(2) The sixteen-year-old son of a multi-millionaire real estate holder was
                        left over fifty million dollars by his fond father, who did not know what
                        else to do with it, the same son having not as yet exhibited any capacity
                        for handling the money wisely or having done anything to deserve it save be
                        the son of the aforesaid father.</p>
                    <p>(3) A somewhat bored group of Newport millionairesses give a dinner for the
                        pet dogs of their equally wealthy friends, one particular dog or doggess
                        being host or hostess.</p>
                    <p>(4) A Staten Island brewer worth twenty millions died of heart failure,
                        induced by undue joy over the fact that he had been elected snare drummer of
                        a shriners&apos; lodge, after spending thousands upon thousands in
                        organizing a band of his own and developing sufficient influence to cause a
                        shriners&apos; organization to tolerate him.</p>
                    <p>(5) A millionaire politician and horse-racer erected a

                        items.</p>
                    <p>By these same papers, covering several months or more, I saw where:</p>
                    <p>(1) Several people died waiting in line on bundle day for bundles of cast-off
                        clothing given by those who could not use the clothes any longernot such
                        people as you and I, perhaps, but those who were sick, or old, or weak.</p>
                    <p>(2) Mr. Ford, manufacturer of automobiles, was convinced that he could reform
                        any criminal or bad character by giving him or her plenty of work to do at
                        good wages and with the prospect of advancement; also that he was earning
                        too much and wished to divide with his fellow man.</p>
                    <p>(3) August Belmont and J. P. Morgan, Jr., noting this item, concluded that
                        they could not do anything for any one, intellectually, financially or
                        otherwise.</p>
                    <p>(4) An attendant in an Odd Fellows Home, having tired of some old patients,
                        chloroformed them alla purely pagan event and not possible in an enlightened
                        age and a Christian country.</p>
                    <p>(5) A priest, having murdered a girl and confessed to it, no way was found to
                        electrocute him because of his cloth. Men whose services and aid he
                        contemned insisted that he must be proved insane and not be electrocuted,
                        though he did not agree with them.</p>
                    <p>(6) A young soldier and his bride, but one day married, walk out to buy
                        furniture for their new home; a street fight in which three toughs assail
                        each other with pistols breaks out and before they can take to cover a stray
                        bullet instantly kills the soldier-husband. Subsequently the bride becomes
                        morbid and goes insane.</p>

                    <p>(7) In nearly all the countries of the late great war a day of prayer for
                        Divine intervention was indulged in, but prayer having been made and not
                        answered the combatants proceeded to make more and worse warDivine
                        prohibition of combat, according to the Christian dogma, being no bar nor of
                        any avail.</p>
                    <p>(8) A well-known Western financier and promoter of strong religious and
                        moralistic leanings, having projected and built a well-known railroad and
                        made it immensely prosperous by reducing the rates to the people of his
                        region was thereupon set upon by other financiers who wished to seoure his
                        property for little or nothing, and being attacked by false charges brought
                        by a suborned stockholder and his road thrown into the hands of a receiver
                        by a compliant judge, was so injured financially thereby as never to be able
                        to recover his property. And those who attacked him justified themselves on
                        the ground that he was a &quot;rate-cutter&quot; and so a disturbing
                        elementa disturber of the peace and profits of other railroads adjacent and
                        elsewhere. His dying statement (years later) was that American history would
                        yet justify him and that God governed for good, if one could wait long
                        enough!</p>
                    <p>(9) One man was given one year for a cold, brutal manslaughter in New York,
                        whereas a whole family of colored people in the South was strung up and
                        riddled with bullets for so little as that one of them fought with a deputy
                        sheriff; while a woman who had shot another woman through a window because
                        of jealousy (aroused by her husband&apos;s assumed attentions to said
                        woman) was acquitted and then went on the stage, the general sentiment being
                        that &quot;one could not electrocute a woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>(10) The principal charities aid society of New York had spent and was
                        spending one hundred and fifty thousand dollars per year on running
                        expenses, and something over ninety thousand dollars in actual relief work,
                        though it was explained <pb id="VAA2441-024" n="15"/> that the hundred and
                        fifty thousand brought about much reference of worthy cases to other
                        agencies and private charities, a thing which could not otherwise have been
                        done.</p>
                    <p>(11) It is immoral, un-Christian and illegitimate to have a child without a
                        husband, yet when six hundred thousand men are withdrawn from England to
                        fight the Germans and twenty thousand virgins become war-brides it is
                        proposed to legalize the children on the ground that it is nevertheless
                        moral to preserve the nation from extinction.</p>
                    <p>(12) A doctor may advise against child-birth when that experience would
                        endanger a woman or threaten her permanent disability, but if he gives
                        information or furnishes contraceptal means which would prevent the trying
                        situation he is guilty of a misdemeanor, subject to fine and the ruin of his
                        career.</p>
                    <p>(13) The president of one of the largest street railway corporations in the
                        world finds it wrong to fail to rise and give your seat to a woman, but
                        right to run so few cars as to make available seats for only one-third of
                        the traffic; wrong not to take extreme precaution in stepping off or on a
                        car or crossing the tracks, but right to leave the cars without heat, the
                        windows and floors dirty and the doors broken, making anger, delay and haste
                        contribute to inattention and unfairness; wrong to read a newspaper wide
                        open, to cross your legs or protrude your feet too far, thereby
                        inconveniencing your fellow-passenger, but right to mulct the city, composed
                        of these same passengers, of millions via stolen franchises, watered stock,
                        avoided taxes, the refusal of transfers at principal intersections, to say
                        nothing of the prevention of fair competition via the jitney bus and other
                        means which would relieve traffic pressure, and all with no excuse save that
                        the corporation desires the money; and a tame public endures it with a
                        little ineffectual murmuring.</p>

                    <p>But need I cite more, really?</p>
                    <p>It is because of these things that I sit in my hall-bedroom, a great panorama
                        of beauty spread out before me, and in attempting to write of this thing,
                        life, find myself confused. I do not know how to work right, truth, justice,
                        mercy, etc., into these things, nor am I sure that life would be as
                        fascinating without them, as driving or forceful. The scenes that I look
                        upon here and everywhere are beautiful enough, sun, moon and stars swinging
                        in their courses, seemingly mathematically and with great art or charm. I am
                        wiling to assume that their courses are calculated and intelligent, but no
                        more and no further. And the river at this moment is begemmed with thousands
                        of lightsa truly artistic and poetic spectacle and one not to be gainsaid.
                        By day it is gray, or blue, or green, wondrous shades by turns; by night a
                        jewel world. Gulls wheel over it; tugs strain cheerily to and fro, emitting
                        gorgeous plumes of smoke. Snows, rains, warmths, colds come in endless
                        variety, the endless fillip which gives force and color to our days.</p>
                    <p>Still I am confused. For, on the one hand, here is Vaclav Melka, who does not
                        care much for this alleged charm; nor John Spitovesky; nor Jacob
                        Feilchenfeld; nor many, many others like them. On the other hand, myself and
                        many others like me, sitting and meditating on it, are so spellbound that
                            <pb id="VAA2441-026" n="17"/> we have scarcely any thought wherewith to
                        earn a living. Life seems to prove but one thing to me, and that is that the
                        various statements concerning right, truth, justice, mercy are palaver
                        merely, an earnest and necessitous attempt, perhaps, at balance and equation
                        where all things are so very much unbalanced, paradoxical and
                        contradictorythe small-change names for a thing or things of which we have
                        not yet caught the meaning. History teaches me little save that nothing is
                        really dependable or assured, but all inexplicable and all shot through with
                        a great desire on the part of many to do or say something by which they may
                        escape the unutterable confusion of time and the feebleness of earthly
                        memory. Current action, it appears, demonstrates much the same thing. Kings
                        and emperors have risen and gone. Generals and captains have warred and
                        departed. Philosophers have dreamed, poets have written; and I, mussing
                        around among religions, philosophies, fictions and facts can find nothing
                        wherewith to solve my vaulting egoism, no light, and no way to be anything
                        more than the humblest servitor.</p>
                    <p>Among so much that is tempestuous and glittering I merely occasionally scrub
                        and make bright my room. I look out at the river flowing by now, after
                        hundreds of millions of years of loneliness where there was nothing but
                        silence and waste (past so much now that is vivid, colorful, human), and say
                        to myself: Well, where there is so much order and love of order in every one
                        and everywhere there must be some great elemental spirit holding for order
                        of sorts, at any rate. Stars do not swing in given orbits for nothing
                        surely, or at least I might have faith to that extent. But when I step out
                        and encounter, as I daily do, lust and greed, plotting and trapping, and
                        envy and all uncharitableness, including murderall severely condemned by the
                        social code, the Bible and a thousand wise saws and lawsand also see, as I
                        daily do, vast schemes of chicane grinding the faces of the poor, and wars
                        brutally involving <pb id="VAA2441-027" n="18"/> the death of millions whose
                        lives are precious to them because of the love of power on the part of some
                        one or many, I am not so sure. Illusions hold too many; lust and greed, vast
                        and bleary-eyed, dominate too many more. Ignorance, vast and almost
                        unconquerable, hugs and licks its chains in reverence. Brute strength sits
                        empurpled and laughs a throaty laugh.</p>
                    <p>Yet here is the great riverthat is beautiful; and Mr. Woolworth&apos;s
                        tower, a strange attempt on the part of man to seem more than he is; and a
                        thousand other evidences of hopes and dreams, all too frail perhaps against
                        the endless drag toward nothingness, but still lovely and comforting. And
                        yet here also is Vaclav Melka, who wants to be a bath-rubber again! John
                        Spitovesky, who doesn&apos;t care; Jacob Feilchenfeld, who never heard;
                        and millions of others like them, and II think and grow confused, and earn
                        nineteen-twenty a week or lessnever more, apparently.</p>
                    <p>Come to think of it, is it not a wonder, holding such impossible views as I
                        do, that I earn anything at all?</p>

                    <head>CHANGE</head>
                    <p>IF I were to preach any doctrine to the world it would be love of change, or
                        at least lack of fear of it. From the Bible I would quote: &quot;The
                        older order changeth, giving place to the new,&quot; and from Nietzsche:
                        &quot;Learn to revalue your values.&quot; The most inartistic and
                        discouraging phase of the visible scene, in so far as it relates to
                        humanity, is its tendency to stratification, stagnation and rigidity. Yet
                        from somewhere, fortunately, out of the demiurge there blows ever and anon a
                        new breath, quite as though humanity were an instrument through which a
                        force were calling for freshness and change. The old or unyielding die or
                        crumble; the unwitting young arise to take their places. By this same thing
                        which brings man into being is he ended before he becomes inelastic and
                        unpliable. Indeed, Nature constantly replaces her handiwork, quite as in the
                        case of the leaves on the trees, creating newer, greener, sappier things.
                        This is just as true of religions, theories, arts and philosophies as it is
                        of animals, races and individuals. Nothing is fixed. The most convincing and
                        stable thing that you know may well bear inquiring scrutiny, even this law
                        of change. Out of the well-springs of the deep what may not arise?</p>
                    <p>I often think how foolishly humanity opposes change at times and how steadily
                        and uninterruptedly it flows in, altering the face of the world. With how
                        many astounding changes has not life been visitedastounding only because
                        life never seems to be prepared for the astounding. Our little earth minds,
                        being only seventy years in duration and wise only by reason of the actual
                        experience which can be crowded into <pb id="VAA2441-029" n="20"/> that
                        time, cannot but view as astounding those larger natural phenomena which in
                        the endless duration of time come swiftly enough, however incalculably slow
                        they may seem to us. &quot;For a thousand years in thy sight are as but
                        yesterday,&quot; a million years but a day in geologic time. But to a
                        being whose duration is only seventy years, whose thinking period about
                        forty, how remote they seem, even impossible! If one could live a thousand
                        years the value of change in connection with many things would appear
                        swiftly enough, and the seemingly astounding would become the natural and
                        even the commonplace.</p>
                    <p>If one but observes the phenomena of geology and of biology one may see how
                        ready Nature is to quit one form of effort for another, once its uselessness
                        has become apparent, to drop a difficult tendency in one direction and
                        pursue an easier one in another. Indeed, the theory of the pragmatist is
                        seemingly well-emphasized at times by the disappearance of some large and
                        presumably successful species for reasons of difficulty in connection with
                        its sustenance, and the steady rise of some minor creature whose wants are
                        simple and not difficult to satisfy. And it is not necessarily through aeons
                        and aeons of time that those changes are accomplished but almost instanter,
                        as when behemoth ended and the great auk puffed out. Man says to himself
                        today, &quot;I am the Lord of creation,&quot; but is he? A slight
                        change in the chemistry of our atmosphere, so slight that it might be
                        scarcely noticeable, a change in the odor of the air or the taste of the
                        water, could soon end or debilitate him so as to make him of no import
                        whatsoever. It might be unfavorable to man and favorable, let us say, to
                        cats or spiders; then man, a sleepy stumbling creature, would be devoured by
                        his hungry, pagan house pet and the theory of his domination disposed of.
                        Remote? So was the rise of Christianity. If you do not believe this read
                        history, or note what tragedies a slight trace of sewer gas can produce in
                        your own household, how smoke ends a corps of firemen, how water, too much
                            <pb id="VAA2441-030" n="21"/> heat, too much cold, may destroy us all.
                        And what star so humble that if it came near enough could not effect one or
                        another of these changes?</p>
                    <p>Deep below deep lie the mysteries, and theories flourish like weeds in a
                        gardenor let us call them flowers, for at times they are so artistic. Arts
                        spring out of the mysteries, but the arts themselves grow stale if left to
                        themselves. The thing that the individual should remember is that he is a
                        part of this vast restlessness, uncertainty and opportunism. Life will have
                        none of anything forever, neither Egypt nor Greece nor Rome nor England nor
                        America; it will not have anything of one type of god, nor a fixed code of
                        morals, nor a fixed conclusion as to what is art, nor a method of living. We
                        build up rules wherewith life is to be governed, and behold!some fine day
                        the character of life itself changes and our rules are worthless.</p>
                    <p>Many of us now dream that there is such a thing as justice, but experience
                        teaches us that it is an abstraction and that what we actually see is an
                        occasional compromise struck in an eternal battle. Many believe that there
                        is such a thing as truth, but, if there is, it is not within the
                        consciousness of man, for he has not the knowledge wherewith to discern it.
                        There is too much that he does not know to permit him to say what is truth.
                        Likewise, virtue and honesty go by the boards as names merely, a system of
                        weights and measures, balances struck between man and man. They are symbols
                        of something which man would like to believe true and permanent. They
                        represent a balance he would like to strike between extremes on either hand,
                        but they are only important to him in his state here. Beyond him lie the
                        deeps which may know them not. All we can know is that we cannot know.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, what I would most earnestly advocate, if it were of any importance
                        so to do, would be love of change, for by change have come all the
                        spectacles, all the charms and all <pb id="VAA2441-031" n="22"/> the
                        creature comforts of which our consciousness is aware. Life appears to be
                        innately artistic in all that it attempts, so that we need not trouble
                        ourselves about that; we can scarcely escape it. If there is a seeming love
                        of order, of stratification, of fixity, in connection with many things, an
                        equally unending force appears to be bent on change and variation, so that
                        that something within us which tends to rigid duty and stratification spells
                        suffering or disappointment for us in so far as we are unable to counteract
                        it. The caution, sprung from somewhere, to keep an open mind is
                        well-grounded in Nature&apos;s tendency to change. Not to cling too
                        pathetically to a religion or a system of government or a theory of morals
                        or a method of living, but to be ready to abandon at a moment&apos;s
                        notice is the apparent teaching of the agesto be able to step out free and
                        willing to accept new and radically different conditions. This apparently is
                        the ideal state for the human mind. Not that anything so much more perfect
                        is in store (I, for one, do not believe that), but that a different thing is
                        at hand, always, outside your door, around the corner, beyond the limits of
                        the vision of even the philosopher and the thinker. To be always ready, if
                        such a thing were possible, to meet the new and to know that it will be as
                        valuable as the oldthat is the great thing. But what vain advice! for the
                        experiences, the capacities, the tendencies of man are not in his keeping.
                        There is something controlling, of which we are a part and not a part; there
                        is a mystery to which we belong yet which will not show to us its face. Only
                        its impulses burst upon us from day to day and from century to century,
                        making us weep from fear or regret, or faint with terror, or thrill wild
                        with joy. Out of the deeps they comethe realms we do not know. What is
                        Master? Who? What is He or It like? Only by the artistry and the terror and
                        the peace and the change through which it works can we guess, <pb
                            id="VAA2441-032" n="23"/> and all names and fames and blames by which we
                        qualify it are as nothing, save that they brighten the face of its one

                    <head>SOME ASPECTS OF OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER</head>
                    <p>OUR most outstanding phases, of course, are youth, optimism and illusion.
                        These run through everything we do, affect our judgments and passions, our
                        theories of life. As children we should all have had our fill of these, and
                        yet even at this late date and after the late war, which should have taught
                        us much, it is difficult for any of us to overcome them. Still, no one can
                        refuse to admire the youth and optimism of America, however much they may
                        resent its illusion. There is always something so nave about its method of
                        procedure, so human and tolerant at times; so loutish, stubborn and
                        ignorantly insistent at others, as when carpetbag government was forced on
                        the South after the Civil War and Jefferson Davis detained in prison for
                        years after the war was over.</p>
                    <p>Great men and great events, so I was told in my youth, went to the making of
                        us. The dreams of justly dissatisfied and downtrodden souls elsewhere, so
                        our histories read, impelled them to seek in a new land freedom from the
                        tyrannies which had oppressed them abroad. Once here, they were prepared to
                        fight and die in order that the vision which had led them forth might not
                        end as an airy insubstantial nothing. For us (fatalistically, at any rate,
                        if not really) Columbus sailed from Palos over the uncharted deep; Magellen
                        rounded the Cape of Good Hope; and Vasco da Gama, Cape Horn; Balboa
                        discovered the Pacific, Hendrick Hudson the Hudson; De Soto and Marquette
                        the Mississippi. For us, especially (although before that, great sociologic,
                        economic and moral dreamers had been at work), Locke, Paine, Von Humboldt,
                            <pb id="VAA2441-034" n="25"/> Voltaire, Fourier, de Tocqueville,
                        Rousseau thought and dreamed.</p>
                    <p>In our new land, fresh upon an unbroken soil, giant spirits swiftly arose to
                        testify to the significance of these dreamsWashington, Jefferson, Franklin,
                        Adams, Hamilton, intellectual and social enthusiasts allwho saw a vision, or
                        seemed to, and dreamed tremendous dreams of the wonders to come to our
                        nation and race, and because of it and through it to the world at large. We,
                        more than any other nation, because ours was the youth and the strength,
                        were to lift and maintain aloft the banner of intellectual and spiritual
                        freedom. We were to do tremendous things, not for the human pocketbook but
                        the human mind and soul. Our children and our children&apos;s children
                        were to be free, progressive, fearless, mentally and spiritually alert,
                        entirely loosened from the trammels and chains of superstition and the
                        degradation of poverty and want.</p>
                    <p>Well, it is quite true that we have done some things: fought wars for our
                        &quot;rights&quot;; freed the slaves (which, however, England did in
                        her territories before we did and without bloodshed);
                        &quot;liberated&quot; Cuba (to no exploitation since?); struggled
                        with the Philippine and Mexican problems (to no final solution however); and
                        then helped to crush the Kaiser without seeking gain for ourselves. However,
                        it is also quite true that at no time in our history has this ideal been
                        quite realized, even though in the hearts of a modest percentage of the
                        population, as can be most safely asserted, this has been a dominant and
                        moving ideal. Perhaps its realization is not within the possibilities of
                        life. We are all slaves essentially, and there have as yet been no measures
                        devised whereby strong and weak people will not be generated at one and the
                        same time side by side. But it is useless to say to the average American
                        that democracy is a dream and can never be realized. He will never believe
                        it. Wars come and go. Strong men arise and plot and conquer and disappear.
                        Weak men fail, and the <pb id="VAA2441-035" n="26"/> poor are as much put
                        upon here as anywhere and ignored and laughed at; but in spite of all these
                        facts which endure in the face of every dreamof love, heaven, perfect
                        happiness as well as perfect libertythe American goes on dreaming his sweet
                        dream, and will. Perhaps he already has all the democracy there will ever
                        be, because he believes that he has it.</p>
                    <p>Millions of Americans born on this soil or arriving here from other lands
                        believe thus. With them it was and perhaps still is a glowing and enlivening
                        thought that whether they were or not they were supposed to be free. Their
                        children and their children&apos;s children somehow are to be heirs to a
                        magnificent and comforting land, one over which a wise and generous form of
                        government, the fruit of the dreams and genius of their forefathers, their
                        generosity and social aspiration, is to rule and ensure all the blessings
                        for which they had hoped and fought.</p>
                    <p>Well and good. The thing has substance enough even now in the face of some
                        setbacks and because of virgin soil and boundless untouched opportunities,
                        unharassed by war or slavery, which offer to physical labor as well as to
                        the imagination of those who come or who went before us, great opportunity.
                        Their success hitherto has been written into our songs, our books, the
                        public messages of our statesmen and patriots. Even to this day, many who
                        lack even a shadow of the substance of these dreams are still dreaming, if
                        not in their reality at least in their possibility and eventuality here. I
                        in my youth was one of these. I saw in America what many others around me
                        seemed to see: i. e., many if not all of the things for which our
                        forefathers fought and bled: generous, protective and encouraging laws in
                        all walks of life; an amazingly free and unterrified press; a warm,
                        sympathetic and encouraging educational system reaching down to the poorest
                        and humblest child and helping it to rise and better its station; <pb
                            id="VAA2441-036" n="27"/> a real political referendum or ballot system
                        by which all projected laws and movements for the betterment and control of
                        the impulses and tendencies of the people were formulated and with their
                        consent;and these seemed real enough.</p>
                    <p>Well?</p>
                    <p>Well, I still think we have a modicum of these things. The pressure of the
                        strong upon the weak is as yet not too grinding perhaps, and let us hope may
                        never be, although it is daily becoming sharper. The poor are being put upon
                        while being loudly told that they are notfed on air and kind words, as it
                        were. The powerful are learning that the poor, here as elsewhere, are either
                        fools or, being poor, may not help themselves; a very dangerous state of
                        mind to begin with, I think.</p>
                    <p>Yes, in recent years a certain change has come over the spirit of our
                        original dreams. Our bright morning sky has been overcast with something
                        that was by no means foreseen by the charming and gracious idealists who
                        framed our Constitution and, better yet, our ideals. America, ungracious as
                        it may seem on the part of one who has prospered well enough in it, is
                        neither so free nor so liberal as many imagined it would be. Our press, our
                        school system, our laws, our political methodsdo these today answer to the
                        incisive aspiration which was characteristic, or at least was supposed to be
                        characteristic, of the spirit of those who generated the American
                        Republic?</p>
                    <p>Let us see.</p>
                    <p>The fact is that what is supposed to be and what is true of American history
                        are two very different things. Because as a people we have instinctively
                        craved some things and have written it into a Constitution that man is
                        inalienably entitled to them, it does not follow that we have them; although
                        most Americans, I am inclined to fear, think so. If I read American history
                        aright, the men who drew up the Declaration of Independence and framed our
                        Constitution were men who, like <pb id="VAA2441-037" n="28"/> ourselves
                        today, were in the grip of an ideal which had very little to do with their
                        own condition or the actual working necessities and conditions of life as
                        seen about them. Far from being democratic at that time America was quite
                        the reverse, a most stratified and nobility-aping nation with feudal
                        servants and thralls at the bottom and landed and all but titled proprietors
                        at the top (&quot;History of the Great American Fortunes,&quot;
                        Myers). But those same leaders and many followers appear to have been in the
                        grip of a time-spirit or movement which had its roots as far back in time as
                        the thirteenth century, when Europe seemed to give new birth or breath to
                        the pagan spirit and to revolt at the mummery and flummery of kings and the
                        gorgeous paraphernalia of a religious idea run completely to seed. Hess and
                        Bruno were but the foresteppers of Luther. Bacon, Locke, Voltaire, de
                        Tocqueville, Rousseau and Paine, had much to do with the spirit of our
                        American Constitution. Indeed, it is a question whether the latter six, and
                        especially Rousseau with his &quot;Social Contract,&quot; his dream
                        of a new social arrangement in which the State should do so much more than
                        it had ever before attempted to do for its constituent units, are not the
                        makers of the Declaration of Independence. Yet nothing that Paine, Voltaire,
                        Locke or Rousseau dreamed or believed concerning the essential capacity of
                        man to govern himself is absolutely true. What is true is that autocracy or
                        single-headed government without genius and a love of humanity is closely
                        allied, or very likely to be, to tyranny; whereas democracy or
                        multiple-headed rotation in control is likely to prove even more dangerous
                        where it is merely dull. It has not even the advantage of being spectacular
                        and interesting. Whether the individual, thus protected against tyranny, is
                        likely to prove a greater and more useful engine or mechanism for the
                        development of more and better thought, more beautiful dreams and ideals
                        than the world ever had before, remains to be seen. Dominant <pb
                            id="VAA2441-038" n="29"/> America, now in the saddle of the world, has
                        an opportunity to prove this.</p>
                    <p>But does history provide a single analogy? Scarcely. The older nations were
                        not built so much for the individual, that he might have life, liberty and
                        the pursuit of happiness guaranteed him, as for the perpetuation and glory
                        of the State itself, or the King thereof. This was true of Athens and Sparta
                        as well as the Roman Republic, and more recently of Germany. It is very
                        doubtful whether the modern republic is made any more for the humble, single
                        individual than the old-time kingdom. Is not the modern trust-magnate or
                        money-baron who taxes and drives him by his wage arrangements and food
                        extortion as much of a King, or at least a medieval baron, as any such that
                        ever lived? Take Rockefeller, for example. How different is he, or others
                        like himMorgan, for instanceto the Dons who in combination ruled Spain,
                        laughing at its King, or the money-lords who direct the policy of England
                        today, as did their equivalents in Russia and Germany before the late
                        war?</p>
                    <p>The truth is that it is given to few, if any, individuals of a nation to
                        understand it. By some it is assumed that the individual must rule. By
                        others the mass. Neither is true. The mass at times must be pitted against
                        the individual, and vice versa. But neither must disappear entirely. That
                        would spell death or slumber. It is also a question whether any nation at
                        any time ever collectively understands itself. Do not some portions of its
                        units always misunderstand other portions? Take our part in the late great
                        war. Sentimentally, a fair portion of America&apos;s integral units
                        assumed that we entered the war to &quot;free humanity from
                        slavery&quot; and &quot;to make the world safe for
                        democracy,&quot; a very large order; but, to quote one of President
                        Wilson&apos;s later utterances, it was for a somewhat different purpose,
                        namely, &quot;the destruction of every arbitrary power anywhere that can
                        separately and secretly and of <pb id="VAA2441-039" n="30"/> single choice
                        disturb the peace of the world.&quot; Well, that is not exactly the same
                        as making it safe for democracybut still. The truth probably is that the
                        nation, propelled by its instinct for self-preservation, entered the war to
                        make America safe. It is not at all unlikely that sooner or later we should
                        have gone to war with Germany had there been no European war. Germany was
                        known to regard with avid eye many phases of this Western hemisphere, its
                        resources, institutions, pretensions; so America very practically, however
                        sentimental the reasons given may be, engaged herself on the side of four or
                        five powers of the first rank (some long friendly, others not uniformly so)
                        to protect her future interests.</p>
                    <p>From a practical point of view there were, and of course were sure to be,
                        many who disagreed with the somewhat sentimental interpretation of all this.
                        More than one person of authority at the time privately ventured the opinion
                        that in giving so much to aid Europe something should have been done to
                        secure for America its future integrity in the Western hemisphere.
                        &quot;In so far as Mexico, Canada, the West Indies and the Pacific are
                        concerned,&quot; wrote one authority, &quot;should not everything be
                        done to further our interests there?&quot; Canada, one would say,
                        thinking of a nation that should be looking reasonably well after its own
                        welfare, should be made at least sovereignthat is, independent of Great
                        Britainand compelled to enter into commercial and definite offensive and
                        defensive alliances with us; the forts along our borders dismantled and all
                        plans to oppose us at any future time set aside. Again, all of the West
                        Indies, so it was argued, now controlled by European powers, should have
                        been exacted or made independent under our protection so as not to fall into
                        the hands of our enemies in the future. Should not, asked some, a halt have
                        been called to European aggression in China, the open door insisted upon?
                        ... The seas should have been made absolutely neutralpoliced by America,
                        along with others. <pb id="VAA2441-040" n="31"/> A great, even dominant,
                        merchant marine should have been built up. Why the expenditure of endless
                        blood and treasure, with no definite strength added to the point of
                        viewwhich the United States representsthe right of her ideas as well as
                        those of other people to prosper and grow strong?</p>
                    <p>But witness what was actually done, where our chief interests lay: Belgium, a
                        country that had never been a completely sovereign State with rights which
                        were inalienable, but a State which was the product of the fears of Europe,
                        commanding our sympathies as though it had been individual and free
                        throughout history. It was torn from Holland by England and France only as
                        recently as 1830. England and France chose its reigning housethe English
                        Queen&apos;s uncle, who was speedily married to the daughter of the King
                        of France. Yet with Ireland, India, Egypt, the Philippines, the Boer
                        Republic and other violated lands and nationalities before us, the woes of
                        this one country developed our greatest interest. Japan guaranteed the
                        neutrality of Korea, but annexed it with the consent of the powers. England,
                        before our very eyes, suppressed attempts at &quot;self-determination by
                        smaller nations of their rights&quot; in Egypt, Ireland, India, the Boer
                        Republic. Yet we thought nothing, or at least did nothing. Yet the Balkans,
                        for some peculiar reason not easily to be explained, aroused another
                        sentimental emotion in us. Although one would have said the interest of
                        America in the question of what should become of Russia, Turkey and the
                        Balkans was not direct, and from an old-time practical and political point
                        of view never could be, yet America interfered there as elsewhere, laying
                        down, or attempting to, a rule for the future organization of Europe
                        (self-determination of nations!), and that without any referendum to the
                        American voter, any definite constitutional inquiry as to what <hi rend="i"
                            >he</hi> thought of all this.</p>
                    <p>Yet the neglect of the latter, most important in a self-determining democracy
                        or republic, one would suppose, was <pb id="VAA2441-041" n="32"/> passed
                        over as nothing, while it was assumed or preached by those in the lead, and
                        in the face of much repressed grumbling, that we were engaged unquestionably
                        with those who were nearest to and best for us intellectually, spiritually
                        and in every other way, nations which would seek, or had invariably sought
                        our welfare in the past. But history, of course, demonstrated that this was
                        not true and that such alliances were only momentarily beneficial, if at
                        all, and later were broken without so much as a by-your-leave or a farewell.
                        But did this serve to alter the state of public feeling or illusion? By no
                        means. In so far as England was concerned it appeared to strengthen it,
                        although this was the first time she had ever been on our side (1776, 1812,
                        1865, 1896); (18978, the Boer War). In all those instances we were anything
                        but pro-British. So again with France in 1788 and 1815, when we practically
                        declared war on her in favor of England, although she had reason to expect
                        our sympathy and aid. Our attitude toward Italy has varied, as it has toward
                        Russia: now friendly, now the reverse. Taking into consideration the brevity
                        of all international alliances one would have supposed that it would have
                        been the imperative duty of American statesmen to make sure that in the
                        course of a temporary alliance with European powers the best interests of
                        the American nation would not have been imperiled, but being powerful and
                        optimistic we assumed that our interests were safe enough, or, if not, that
                        we could make them so, and let it go at that. But supposing we had not been
                        so powerful? Would God, Justice, Mercy, Truth, Progress and a number of
                        other things invoked during the great argument, have been on our side? All
                        failure, some one has said, is due to but two things: weakness and error.
                        Suppose we had been weak? Or foolish?</p>
                    <p>A singular thing in connection with this same great war and the American
                        people, their history, is the attitude of this <pb id="VAA2441-042" n="33"/>
                        nation toward the French, at this time and earlier. At the beginning of the
                        war AmericaChristian Americawas decidedly opposed to the French, on moral
                        and intellectual grounds, their literature, their art, their stage, their
                        vile tendencies to naturalism in thought and deed. Even before this, at the
                        beginning of our history, the original Colonists, although of various
                        nationalitiesEnglish, French, Dutch, Swedish, Spanishwere finally
                        consolidated under English rule and a fairly systematic warfare waged
                        against the French and the Indians, whom both the French and the English
                        were employing by turns in their contest for supremacy. Yet later, at the
                        time of the dispute between the English and the American Colonies, which
                        ended in the Revolutionary War, French sympathy, due to ancient antipathy to
                        England as well as the intense opposition to autocratic oppression in
                        France, drew the Americans and the French together in a bond of sympathy.
                        The French sent various Generals and Admirals (Rochambeau, Lafayette, Count
                        d&apos;Estaing, Count de Grasse) to help the Americans on land and sea.
                        Yet in 17889, when France and Spain declared war on England, and especially
                        later (after the French Revolution in 1789) when the French were struggling
                        to maintain their democratic independence and England was seeking to put the
                        Bourbon rulers back on the throne of France, do you believe that American
                        sympathy was with the French? If you do, you don&apos;t know American
                        history. Under the offensive and defensive agreement or treaty entered into
                        between France and the Colonies in 1778, when the latter were struggling for
                        their independence, it was confidently expected by the French that the
                        Americans would help them against England, but nothing of the sort followed.
                        When, in the belief that America must sympathize with France,
                        &quot;democratic&quot; societies, after the French model, were
                        organized throughout the States, and later Genet, the French Minister to
                        America, attempted to fit our privateers on American soil and <pb
                            id="VAA2441-043" n="34"/> to establish admiralty ports for the
                        condemnation of prizes, there was great opposition to this. Only read the
                        history of that period (Burgess: &quot;The Middle Period&quot;;
                        Babcock: &quot;American Nationality&quot;; Hart: &quot;American
                        History Told by Contemporaries&quot;). America, according to this new
                        attitude, was now to look out for itself, and in consonance with this in
                        1793 Washington issued his famous Neutrality Proclamation, leaving France to
                        take care of herself. After the issuance of the Proclamation, Genet, still
                        believing that American sympathy must be with France, appealed to the people
                        and openly defied the Government. His recall followed, of course.</p>
                    <p>Then followed a very curious state of affairs. The French Revolutionists,
                        angered by the official attitude of America, fell to attacking American
                        shipping, looking upon it as a hostile power aiding England. American
                        commissionaires, sent to adjust our relations with France, were ignored and
                        representatives of the Revolutionists (or so it was claimed), using the
                        initials &quot;X Y Z,&quot; demanded tribute and a bribe. Hence the
                        famous comment of William Pinckney, the American lawyer and statesman, who
                        said &quot;Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute.&quot;
                        And that against our late ally, France!</p>
                    <p>President Adams laid the correspondence before Congress, and the whole
                        country was aroused. War with France was thought to be inevitable and (1798)
                        Washington was reappointed Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Owing to the
                        activity of French sympathizers in America and rabid criticisms in the
                        newspapers of the Government&apos;s stand in this matter, the
                        Federalists, who were then in power and who had no sympathy for France,
                        secured the passage (1798) of the famous Alien and Sedition Laws. These laws
                        gave the Government power to banish &quot;foreigners&quot; (meaning
                        the French) from the country and to suppress obnoxious newspapers. Actual
                        warfare with France went on upon the sea! But these laws, being against the
                        then &quot;fundamental ideas&quot; of Americans in <pb
                            id="VAA2441-044" n="35"/> regard to free speech and the right of asylum
                        to immigrants, were regarded by enough of the people as proving all the
                        charges of tyranny urged against the Federalists, and at the next election
                        (1800) they were defeated. In the meantime Virginia and Kentucky had
                        resolved, owing to these same Alien and Sedition Laws, that a State might
                        nullify a law of the United States. Congress, because of French attacks on
                        our shipping, formulated the &quot;Spoliation Claims,&quot; and it
                        was not until Napoleon (1800), as First Consul of France, agreed to abandon
                        the French Claim that America was still bound by the treaty of 1778 to aid
                        her that these latter were abandoned and peace reached. In other words, we
                        refused France aid in her most trying hour. Yet twelve years later, because
                        of England&apos;s continuous attacks upon our ships and seamen, trying
                        to prevent our dealing with France in any way, we went to war with heronly
                        she did not quit until the victory over Napoleon removed the cause of her
                        alleged grievances. One hundred years later, as we have just seen (191419),
                        although opposition to France on moral grounds had been steadily growing in
                        America, still in the contest with Germany all the refused sympathy and
                        gratitude of 1800 was revived and France became once more the object of our
                        tenderest solicitude. So much for national moods and gratitudes.</p>
                    <p>Another curious phase of the late great war, as of all countries and wars
                        perhaps, but one which illustrates the American temperament rather clearly,
                        was the attitude of America to one and another phase of it, the psychologic
                        floundering and back somersaults, as it were, concerning one problem and
                        another. For one thing, as we all perhaps remember, the preliminary internal
                        contest was for peace at any price practically, and any one who suggested
                        mobilizing a large army for self-de-fense (if nothing more) was, if not a
                        traitor, something of an undesirable citizen. Mr. Wilson, if you will
                        recall, was elected <pb id="VAA2441-045" n="36"/> the second time on the
                        slogan &quot;He Kept Us Out of War&quot;; also before we entered the
                        war we were told what a blessing it was in one way, commercially at least.
                        Later, as Germany appeared to be winning and America was actually
                        threatened, the whole world had to be made &quot;safe for
                        democracy,&quot; an order so large that publicity was quietly refused it
                        in all countries outside the United States. But that was the sweet milk fed
                        to Americans. Later still, when it came to actually declaring war, although
                        this is a republic and the people are supposed to have a voice in deciding
                        that which they do, no willingness on the part of the authorities, executive
                        or legislative, to refer the matter back to the people for a vote, was in
                        evidence.</p>
                    <p>And once war was declared, the people were allowed or compelled to
                        &quot;take out&quot; whatever opposition they might feel in private
                        thought, not public or open opposition. It was openly admitted that a
                        referendum might have prevented a declaration of war, yet afterwards public
                        complaint was ruggedly suppressedby the courts and officials, if not by the
                        whole people, astounding farces by way of law being perpetrated. Still later
                        on, when it came to &quot;raising&quot; troops, money and supplies
                        (controlling food), volunteer service in the first of these fields was
                        swiftly abandoned, and conscription, with all which that implied in the way
                        of force and putting down opposition to it, free speech as well as free
                        action, was used. &quot;Public sentiment,&quot; as fostered by an
                        administrative press bureau, to say nothing of much foreign propaganda,
                        controlled or overawed the papers. Overawing sentences, such as forty years
                        in the penitentiary, for circulating a pamphlet in opposition to the current
                        will of the Government, were uniformly handed down in all parts of the
                        nation by a judiciary whose independence, sanctity and what not were
                        supposed to be the bulwark of American liberty. But at whose request? <pb
                            id="VAA2441-046" n="37"/> By what authority? The necessity of strict and
                        impartial justice?</p>
                    <p>I am not quarreling with the process; I am showing the thin line of
                        difference between autocracy and democracy where necessity or passing
                        opinion favors one course of conduct or another. Later on, when suggestions
                        in regard to food-saving were rather freely ignored, the
                        &quot;suggestions&quot; became not only suggestions but restrictions
                        and, to quote the food administrator, &quot;the restrictions will be
                        voluntary, <hi rend="i">but</hi> any evasion will result in compulsory
                        enforcement.&quot; Similarly in connection with bond-selling; the people
                        were to lend and lend and lend because they loved their country, but (I am
                        quoting a leading administrative organ) &quot;the period has arrived
                        (October, 1918) to discontinue wooing and soft-soaping. God help the man who
                        is found with filled pockets if the war goes on because of a financial
                        failure here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And it was not alone in such matters where some independence or at least
                        latitude might have been presupposed, but it extended to a press censorship
                        and an intolerance of opposing opinion which compared rather favorably to
                        darkest days of Russian autocracy. Although America is always nave and
                        &quot;free,&quot; its innumerable blessings of tolerance and the
                        like prated of, still there was but one <hi rend="i">publicly endured</hi>
                        opinion in relation to the conduct of the war, and that was prowar. Any
                        other form of thought was rigidly put down, although in England and France
                        one might say one&apos;s say with all but destructive freedom. One woman
                        in New York was actually fined for saying that &quot;Ireland was as good
                        as England any day!&quot; A booklet entitled &quot;Shall Morgan Own
                        the Earth?&quot; and intended to show how the war was profiting some
                        individuals, was first investigated by the Department of Justice and
                        pronounced immune, then later the author was urged &quot;as a patriotic
                        duty&quot; to change the title; still later, even under the milder
                        title, it was refused the privilege of the <pb id="VAA2441-047" n="38"/>
                        mails by the Postoffice Department and the author warned that &quot;to
                        circulate it would subject you to ten years in prison. You know it violates
                        the Espionage Law.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And to what astounding fol-de-rol in regard to the conduct of all wars in the
                        future, if not in the past, were we not treated! There were to be no more
                        brutal wars of any kind anywhere. Ever! Oddly enough, the horrors of the
                        Civil War, especially the part of the Northern soldiers in it, were entirely
                        forgotten; also the &quot;water cure&quot; and &quot;Hell
                        Roaring Jake Smith&quot; of the Philippine campaign were forgottenthose
                        natives, for instance, who were stood up in rows and shot down one after
                        another by an officer with a revolver or who had water poured down their
                        throats and into their noses until they died of strangulation, because they
                        could not, or did not choose to, reveal that which possibly they did not
                        even know. Nations as well as individuals have short memories. Before we
                        entered the war it really looked as though a great war must necessarily be
                        fought with tooth-brushes, so great was the opposition to brutality. Later
                        we were never to fight any more wars at all, or if we did it was all to be
                        ended by one war. A little later one of our greatest agonies was that we
                        could not visit on the enemy something much more terrible than they were
                        visiting on usnational annihilation, no less. We could not live in peace
                        with autocracyalthough, forsooth, we could live in peace with the Japanese,
                        the Chinese, the Imperial Russian Government before it fell, England in
                        India, England in Egyptanything and everything, indeed, save with a nation
                        that did not fight as we did. Never again were the erring nations to be
                        restored to their old place in the world. Between chortles over an immense
                        trade increase, a finally united railway system, new and better methods of
                        food control, intensive agriculture, lessons in self-denial and thought,
                        still, and idiotic as it may seem, the war was an unmixed evil; the Germans
                        were all wrong. &quot;The passage of a thousand <pb id="VAA2441-048"
                            n="39"/> years will not obliterate the memory of Germany&apos;s
                        crime. She will get her good name back when Judas does.&quot; (I am
                        quoting from the Cincinnati Enquirer of March, 1918.) And this in the face
                        of the above-recited blessings pointed out in this very paper! What are you
                        to say for such a ragbag point of view, a national intelligence that can
                        blow hot and cold with the same breath?</p>
                    <p>Actually, it looked for a time as though America were suffering from
                        pernicious mental anemia. Its whole original significance as a
                        forward-pushing, clear-thinking nation appeared to have been clouded over,
                        and, not unlike the bee and the coral insect which apparently serve only one
                        or two purposes in lifethe one to gather honey and pollenize the flowers,
                        the other to build a coral islandthat it had been invented by Nature to
                        devise and manufacture machinery which it should never have the courage or
                        brains to apply to the limits of their possibilities. It was as though the
                        Germans and the English and the Japanese, seeing the peculiar gifts and
                        mental limitations of the American, were to be permitted to use his gifts,
                        quite as we use the stored labor of the bee or the coral insect, and leave
                        him to go on moiling in his brainless mechanistic way. For the average
                        American, who could so easily invent a flying machine, a submarine, a
                        range-finder for guns, a revolving turret, a steel-protected battleship, a
                        steamboat, and what not, was being urged to believe, at first, that he had
                        no heart for their use and that he was &quot;too proud to
                        fight&quot; or lacked the courage to face the horrible grinding
                        necessities of life; later that he was the greatest fighter of all. Only,
                        having proved that, he was still to believe that he was here only to save
                        the world, never by any chance to further his own interests. His great
                        inventions were to be put aside like toys or sold to others or reserved for
                        moral purposes only.</p>
                    <p>For note, up to the hour of sheer tragic compulsion, everything <pb
                            id="VAA2441-049" n="40"/> was, and no doubt still is, to the average
                        American, a matter of morality, and morality, take note, in the limited
                        sense in which he understood and appreciated morals up to that time. You
                        might invent a battleship wherewith to defend yourself and kill other
                        people, but if you used it for any but a Christian or moral purpose, or the
                        enemy who was non-Christian got it (and used it) it was terrible, shameful,
                        a moral crime, not to be blotted out by a thousand years of expiation. To an
                        American, a machine, however deadly in intention, or its method of slaying,
                        was not to be used unless some distinctly moral end was to be achieved by
                        it. And he was to judge as to the moral end involved. But, to his horror, he
                        was finding and did find that the savage and the pagan could get hold of his
                        machine gun or his flying machine, or submarine, or his battleship, or
                        chemic invention of any kind, and turn it on him without any moral
                        compunction whatsoeverand to his still further Christian horror it worked
                        just as well for the savage or the pagan as it did for him. Nature, or God,
                        did not prevent the submarine from discharging a torpedo at an unarmed
                        merchantman any more than it aided the firing of one from a Christian
                        submarine at a pagan battleship. In short, Nature seemed to be without
                        Christianity or Christian morals, and this shocked the American terribly. He
                        found that he had to lay aside, for the time being anyhow, his fine-spun
                        theories and fight in any way that he could, and he proceeded to do so.
                        Whereupon, he won. But to the American, nevertheless, and in spite of all
                        this, Nature was and is still strictly moral. She has fixed, definite and
                        Christian ways by which she works. Whenever the good American by any chance
                        discovers that Nature is betraying him in any way, not working according to
                        the code as handed down at Sinai, or the Mount in Palestine, he is
                        horror-stricken! What! Nature not working according to the Ten Commandments?
                        The weak do not inherit the earth? &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot;
                        not <pb id="VAA2441-050" n="41"/> a universal law? &quot;Thou shalt not
                        steal or commit adultery&quot; not chemic or psychic truth running
                        through all nature? Who says so? Where is our God who told us these things?
                        Why does he not act in our behalf? Why does he not confound the enemy in his
                        blasphemies, destroy him, for flouting these fundamental religious
                        truths?</p>
                    <p>But behold, God does not, or did not act until the Americans, bestirring
                        themselves and laying aside their theorizing, proceeded to fight as do the
                        heathen. Then and then only, with the moral and exegetic rust rubbed off and
                        the good American, standing up vital and dangerous, did the tide turn. Up to
                        that hour the tide was indifferently going against him. The heathen, noting
                        his mood, had picked up the American&apos;s subtle inventions where he
                        laid them downfine, powerful, complete but immoral instrumentsand had used
                        them for &quot;immoral&quot; purposes. And the machines and the
                        schemes of the American, moral though he thought they were, worked just as
                        well for the unmoral heathen as for himself. To his pathetic horror and
                        utter Christian decay he found that if he was to succeed at all he must not
                        only invent subtle and deadly things, but apply them in the same spirit in
                        which he invented them or other people wouldhorrific Nature, working through
                        other non-Christian nations quite as effectively as it worked through good
                        Christian Americans. In other words, Nature was not Christian, not moral, in
                        the sense that a race or an organized society working to protect its selfish
                        internal arrangements and comforts may be, and no amount of energetic
                        spouting on this score helped him in the least. Nature, or God, or what you
                        will, showed that it cared no whit, not a snap of her or his fingers, what
                        becomes of man or an American with his theories, religious or otherwise,
                        unless he was able to protect himself. A man or a nation had to have wealth
                        and power to survive, and if the Germans had had more power they would have
                        survived, methods or means to the contrary <pb id="VAA2441-051" n="42"/>
                        notwithstanding. Ten thousand pagan shrines did not save Rome from the
                        pacifist destruction which Christianity involved. Ten million Christian
                        churches spouting peace and non-warlike ways could not and did not save
                        America or any other country from a nation which put its faith in war and
                        the ruthless forces of Nature herself. Only greater war on our part could do
                        that, and did.</p>
                    <p>But let us consider some of America&apos;s other equally potent and
                        definite moods or opinions in regard to some other things: the negro for
                        one. By the year 1700 slavery, which up to that time had been more or less a
                        matter of individual preference or taste, there being no general Colonial
                        agreement in regard to it, had become an economic institution in Colonial
                        life. A legalized status of Indian, white and negro servants had preceded
                        slavery in almost all, if not all, the English-maintained colonies; but
                        apparently it paid to make them slaves, and they were so made in spite of
                        the legal fact that they were not. Later the difference in the industries of
                        the several States made slavery more desirable in some States than in
                        others, and then the natural boundary lines of the slave territory began to
                        develop. Georgia and South Carolina especially were clamoring for
                        slave-labor on the tobacco, cotton and rice plantations; whereas in the
                        North it was found to be an unsatisfactory system, and so there was early
                        developed in those Colonies a sentiment against a negro population and the
                        institution of slavery in general. It cannot be said that this was due
                        entirely to the economic disadvantage of keeping slaves in the Norththere
                        always existed some opposition to slavery in the minds of individualsbut
                        would it have been effective if slave labor had been profitableas
                        profitable, say, as it was in the South? Jefferson, for instance, wrote a
                        denunciation of slavery into his draft of the Declaration of Independence,
                        but later, owing to its <pb id="VAA2441-052" n="43"/> probable effect on
                        slave-holding Colonies, ereased, it. And negroes were freely lynched and
                        burned in New York City in 1712 and 1741 because they were suspected of a
                        desire to rebel against slavery. A public slave-market was established in
                        New York City as early as 1709!</p>
                    <p>Yet to hear the average Christian American of today or earlier talk of
                        slavery and its horrors and the great war fought to free the negro, you
                        might assume that he liked him. Far from it. Although a Northern Congress
                        (March 2d, 1867) attempted to impose universal manhood suffrage on the South
                        and (1875) passed a law forbidding discrimination against negroes in inns,
                        public conveyances, theaters and other places, aimed principally at the
                        South, still the negro has never been accepted in the spirit of these laws
                        either in the North or South. In any residence neighborhood anywhere in
                        America, when the black man begins to come in the whites move out. Excellent
                        as he may be, and I have known many who were wholly admirable, he is not
                        even wanted in the same churches or schools. And the feeling, instead of
                        growing less, becomes stronger. Almost daily he is burned alive somewhere in
                        America, and for all but indifferent crimes. America may have fought and
                        bled for his physical freedom, but she does not want him about; and when, as
                        in 1917 in East St. Louis, employers attempted to use him to break a strike,
                        he was murdered (117 of him in that instance), his homes burned, his wives
                        and children driven out of the region; and in the far South, where one of
                        him has even so much as insulted a deputy sheriff, he has been done to
                        death, he and his entire family. Yet the American has no plan for the
                        negrohis threatening future here. He merely allows the question to go
                        begging, trusting to luck, no doubt. Puzzle: does the American citizen want
                        the negro, or doesn&apos;t he?</p>
                    <p>Take once more the matter of the American and the idle, <pb id="VAA2441-053"
                            n="44"/> greedy or predatory rich, as you please, and their attitude
                        toward America, all being citizens of the same land. Because a Colonial
                        American once wrote it down in our Declaration of Independence that men are
                        created free and equal, that they are, and of <hi rend="i">right</hi> ought
                        to be, entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness at the hands
                        of their fellow-citizens and the world, the American ever since has been
                        amazed and troubled by the curious human or chemic contradictions of and
                        oppositions to this, not only in others but himself. Struggling along trying
                        to be free and happy he finds that he is constantly interfered with by
                        others who are doing the same thing, and that, Declaration of Independence
                        or no Declaration of Independence, the curious fact remains that the strong,
                        the ruthless, the shrewd get along as well here as they do anywhere and that
                        they are constantly developing ways and means of undermining him and
                        foreshortening his peace and happiness in favor of their own.</p>
                    <p>Thus, in illustration: (1) A Federal judge (1919) ruled that although
                        Congress (1918) had forbidden any one to compel children of ten or more
                        years of age to labor in cotton mills, still it was unconstitutional for
                        Congress so to forbid and those who wished could so employ children. Result,
                        hundreds of thousands of children returned to eleven hours per day factory
                        labor.</p>
                    <p>(2) A New Jersey judge, one Gumere by name, ruled (1900) that a
                        child&apos;s life, lost in an accident on a railroad or other public
                        conveyance, was not worth more than one dollar, the child not being as yet a
                        source of profit to its parents.</p>
                    <p>(3) An Ohio circuit judge (William H. Taft, afterwards President of the
                        United States) ruled (1893) that quitting work without the consent of the
                        employer was a criminal offense on the part of an employee.</p>
                    <p>(4) The Federal Supreme Court ruled (1908) that arbitration in labor disputes
                        is unconstitutional, therefore something <pb id="VAA2441-054" n="45"/> which
                        an employer may not even enter upon with his employees.</p>
                    <p>(5) The Oregon Supreme Court decided (1903) that a citizen might be legally

                        explicit prohibition on the part of the American Constitution.</p>
                    <p>(6) The Massachusetts Supreme Court held in one dispute (1906) that where
                        conditions are unsatisfactory there is no remedy open to labor save by
                        individual and personal suit; union or combined action being illegal or
                        unconstitutional.</p>
                    <p>(7) Four magnates, two of them controlling the production and two the
                        distribution of milk for and in New York City, decided (January 10, 1919)
                        that since they could not agree as to how the profits of the sale of milk in
                        New York City were to be divided among them, New York was to have no milk
                        until they could agree. Time of city without milk, one month.</p>
                    <p>(8) One Barnet Baff, wholesale chicken merchant in New York City, was
                        murdered because he would not enter upon a scheme with other
                        chicken-wholesalers to fix prices and extort a higher profit from the
                        public. Secondary executors, but not primary instigators or murderers, were
                        caught and electrocuted.</p>
                    <p>(9) In Lachnor vs. New York (198 U. S. 45) a majority of the judges of the
                        New York Court of Appeals held unconstitutional a law limiting the hours of
                        labor of bakers, many of whom (women) were forced to toil twelve hours daily
                        in cellars to earn wages barely sufficient to keep them alive. The Court
                        held that this law was void because it interfered with freedom of
                        contract.</p>
                    <p>(10) In Ives vs. South Buffalo Ry. Co. (94 N. E. R. 431), a case in which a
                        railroad employee, crippled for life while at work and without
                        &quot;contributory negligence,&quot; sued for recompense, the New
                        York Court of Appeals unanimously decided <pb id="VAA2441-055" n="46"/> that
                        the law under which the suit was brought was unconstitutional. The judges
                        admitted the injustice, since the man was helpless, but held the
                        Constitution responsible.</p>
                    <p>... One might thus go forward for pages. I merely cite these in order to
                        present a few definite instances. The truth is that while the average
                        American imagines he is better looked after and more free here than he would
                        be elsewhere, it is more a matter of thought than anything else. As to his
                        daily earning and living capacity, while it is true that he gets more pay he
                        also pays more for what he buys. A rising scale of wages has so regularly
                        been accompanied by a lowering of the purchasing power of the dollar that he
                        has not been much comforted by higher wages. In fact, the National
                        Department of Labor (February, 1919), after studying family budgets in
                        various cities of the country, announced that the then exorbitant cost of
                        necessities bore heaviest on incomes of one thousand dollars or <hi rend="i"
                            >less</hi>, although five percent of the population controlled
                        ninety-five per cent of the wealth of the nation. And one should further
                        note the rising Protection policy of a hundred years, under which the trusts
                        flourished without any notable increase of wages to the local consumer, and
                        the local consumer paid uniformly higher prices than those paid by
                        foreigners for the same grade of goods, often the very same goods made here
                        and shipped abroad. This protection explains the American multi-millionaire;
                        also the American beggar and his slum. It also explains the profiteer. If
                        the average American has had a little more of food and clothes than the men
                        of some other countries, he has also been confronted by the very irritating
                        spectacle of thousands upon thousands who have so much more than he has or
                        can get. He has been made to appear as poor as any churchmouse anywhere,
                        and, worst of all, his woes get but small attention from those who,
                        financially able to control his only medium of expression, the newspapers,
                        insist upon telling him that he is well <pb id="VAA2441-056" n="47"/> and
                        happy. If any one should doubt this, let him consult, for one thing, the
                        report of the Federal Trade Commission appointed by Congress (Report handed
                        down June, 1918), wherein it was charged and proved that large exactions and
                        safe profiteering permitted more than one giant concern to double, treble,
                        even quintuple, its capitalization and still earn from 100 to 227 per cent
                        in one instance. Coal, valued at five cents a ton in the ground, was being
                        sold for twenty-two dollars a ton in New Yorknot over two hundred and fifty
                        miles away. Milk was shoved up rapidly from seven to seventeen-and-one-half
                        cents a quart, and with no interference on the part of any one and no effort
                        to pool the wasteful competition and duplication of systems which, on the
                        other hand, were offered as an excuse for the necessity of the more than 100
                        per cent increase. Wheat, potatoes, meat, oil, sugar rose in proportion.
                        There was no corresponding increase in the wages, save to unionized labor
                        (which was the only form of labor in a position to demand a just share, and
                        which constituted but ten per cent of all employed). And these had to
                        indulge in three hundred and sixty-seven strikes in the first three years of
                        the war to effect even so much as a twenty per cent increase. (I am quoting
                        figures furnished by the United States Bureau of Labor.) When complaint was
                        made, one enthusiastic retort on the part of a corporation press was that
                        the natural law of supply and demand must be allowed to work, that
                        interference with exhorbitant prices meant curtailment of production at the
                        source. The poor producer, robbed of his just right to high prices under a
                        strenuous demand, would become discouraged and quit! On the other hand, the
                        producer was constantly complaining that he was getting little more than
                        before, while the rapidly increasing cost of labor was cited as proving the
                        need of a from 100 to a 1000 per cent increase on everythingshoes, clothes,
                        food, rent.</p>
                    <p>That is all simple and interesting enough when one accepts <pb
                            id="VAA2441-057" n="48"/> human nature for what it is: a thing of rough
                        balances and equations only or a catch-as-catch-can struggle in which the
                        strong or the shrewd survive and the weak go under. But when, in the same
                        land in which these things occur, the air is full of a huge hubbub over the
                        extreme merits of democracy, and when at the same time any one who says
                        anything against profiteering or intimates that democracy as such may be
                        subject to at least some of the faults of autocracy is looked upon as an
                        enemy, if not an enemy alien, it becomes slightly anachronistic, to say the
                        least.</p>
                    <p>It is also a matter of pride with most of us, frequently expressed in
                        disparagement of our European contemporaries, that we are a nation of
                        workers. To hold a position in any American community, so the thought runs,
                        a man must have a job. We do not conceal our contempt for the chap who fails
                        to go down to an office or a business every day. Often, of course, our
                        ostentatious <hi rend="i">workers</hi> do go down but do very little work.
                        Still, somehow it is felt by the public at large that every man owes it to
                        the community or the nation to put in from six to ten hours outside of the
                        residential district doing something, if no more than twiddling his thumbs.
                        Hence the huge commuting armies oscillating to and fro, between home and
                        office or factory. And yet can it be said that American commercial activity
                        is so immensely more profitable than that of any other nation? Or even as
                        much so? During the late great war it was actually proved that both Germany
                        and England had shrewder and more profitable business schemes and methods.
                        The German plan for national co-operative buying was one. Again, the
                        superior efficiency of the Germans and even the English was one of the facts
                        which burst like a flash of lightning out of a clear sky upon the astonished
                        American, the instantaneous skill with which all national resourcesfood,
                        clothing, transportation man-powerwere mobilized and put <pb
                            id="VAA2441-058" n="49"/> at the services of the nation, the relative
                        cheapness of it all, the efficiency with which it was maneuvered once it was
                        in the hands of the Government. Yet the American business man as well as the
                        American executive, while English and French Commissionaires were
                        instructing our factory masters and &quot;Captains of
                        Industry,&quot; had been bustling down to his desk each day, his
                        telephone to his ear, or racing from one directors&apos; meeting to
                        anotherand the result to America was the largest war debt per capita for
                        time of service in the war and number of men involved of any nation in the
                        world, not even excepting Russia. Question: Is the American business man as
                        efficient as we think he is? As honest? As patriotic? Is he?</p>
                    <p>Another curiosity of American character is, or was before the war, its
                        adoration of all things foreign. Everything abroad was, if it is not now,
                        excellent, priceless, beyond all praise or blame; whereas anything native,
                        or even occidental, was more or less worthless or inconsiderableeven such
                        things as the Andes and Amazon, as contrasted with the Alps and the Nile;
                        Brazil and Argentina, Mexico and the Canadian snows were as nothing compared
                        to Belgium or Turkey, the Riviera, Asia, Africa. One cannot help smiling a
                        little at times at the grand manner with which the only moderately equipped
                        foreigner, intellectually or otherwise, has been permitted to walk abroad in
                        America and either sniff at or patronize all with which he comes in contact
                        as though it were nothing. And the pathetic desire of the American to live
                        up to what foreigners expected of himeven the waiters of France or the
                        middle class or gentry of England. And as for the English lord, the French
                        or Italian count, the Austrian or even German baron, the Spanish grandee,
                        the Russian prince or Turkish pashait is folly to deny that he wasmay be
                        even yet, for all one knowsovercome by his attentions. To the American they
                        were inherently better, in some strange sense, more versed in <pb
                            id="VAA2441-059" n="50"/> the ways of that great world which he longed
                        to explore. Let a restaurant advertise a French cuisine or cook; a tailor
                        say he is English; a beauty-parlor or dressmaker that it or she or he is of
                        Paris; a writer or artist that he is of French, Russian, Italian, English
                        extractioncreak goes the American knee and instanter your native American is
                        down on his marrowbones, his eyes rolled heavenward. Of Paris! Of London! Of
                        Rome! Of St. Petersburg! Of Vienna! Ah! How many American fortunes have been
                        re-banked in Europe to the order of the thinnest of noble pretensions! What
                        millions have not been expended in an all but useless effort to take on the
                        color and surface veneer of European manners and culture! To this day a
                        foreign make of car, watch, cloth, is inherently better than that of any
                        American manufacture. Formerly foreign plays practically excluded the
                        American productand rightly enough, in my judgment. We have been
                        &quot;raised&quot; on the foreign book, the foreign picture, the
                        foreign object of art. The Swiss, French or Austrian Alpshow for a hundred
                        years at least have they not outrivaled everything America has to offer!</p>
                    <p>And well enough, perhaps, since as yet America has no intellectual
                        atmosphere, no native art force wherewith to present its claim, even to
                        itself. A drab, and in places narrowly ignorant, people, imagining that it
                        is religious, moral, conservativea thousand things that really it is not.
                        Since it is mental capacity that makes a country interesting to itself and
                        others, perhaps it is the drab attitude of the American toward what he has
                        and is which makes his land so uninteresting to himself and others. Give him
                        a different mental attitude, more perspective, &quot;punch,&quot;
                        daring in regard to life itself, and America would soon take on a luster not
                        outrivaled by that of any other land.</p>
                    <p>Let us contemplate in this connection another and, in so far <pb
                            id="VAA2441-060" n="51"/> as this essay is concerned, final phase of the
                        American mindfor I have elsewhere dealt with moral narrownessand that is his
                        serious and, were it not so pathetic and at times tragic, one might say,
                        amusing, faith in the ballot and what it will or can accomplish for him.
                        Always, always he is voting for some onea mayor or a State legislator every
                        year; a congressman every two years, a senator every four or six; a governor
                        every two and a President every four yearsand he is under the illusion that
                        thereby, by his vote, his choice of a candidate, he is running the
                        Government and maintaining his so-called liberties. The futility of his vote
                        in the late great war might have taught him something, if only he were to be
                        taught. To this day he has not discovered that, in the main, he is merely
                        voting for individuals thrust upon him by interests and forces over which he
                        has no control, never has had, and apparently never can have, and the
                        election or defeat of whom does not depend upon him or the individuals about
                        whom he is so excited. Mayors, governors, state legislators, congressmen,
                        senators, and even judges and presidents, come and go, but the powerful
                        interests at the top remain; and however much the former may be imbued with
                        a desire to do something for the rank and file, the latter are there to
                        revise or repress their emotions or opinions, and the ordinary voter finds
                        himself about where he was beforeof small force or weight in the vast welter
                        of American politics. In short, keen money-masters at the top long since
                        learned that a bare majority of votes anywhere, in or out of congress or a
                        state legislature, is sufficient to confer rule and that, apart from
                        convincing the intellect by sound argument, there were many, many ways of
                        bending the representatives of the people to their will. If this is not
                        true, how is it that five per cent of them have ninety-five per cent of the
                        wealth and the other ninety-five only five?</p>
                    <p>Those who have made a study of the history of the American judiciary have
                        stood in amaze before the evidence that non <pb id="VAA2441-061" n="52"/>
                        elective branches of the Government could so consistently, so openly and so
                        contemptuously undo the work of the elective branches (The Dred Scott
                        decision; the first nullification of the income tax; to cite only two). In
                        what American city would an outside corporation desiring real facilities or
                        privileges not deem itself lunatic not to see the individual local boss, who

                    <p>In what American city or state, pray, would a popular vote for any franchise
                        or improvement, however needful, be of any avail unless the consent of the
                        financial oligarchs at the top (in Wall Street principally) were first
                        obtained? So much is this a commonplace that even the voters themselves
                        would laugh at the suggestion of any power lying in them to obtain any such
                        thing. Before the Government temporarily took over the railroads during the
                        period of the great war, Lucius Tuttle (a mere single illustration, this),
                        president of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, controlled the political
                        life of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont and lifted up or cast down, at his
                        personal whim, members of legislatures, governors, and United States
                        senators. This is a matter of record, not of rumor. The quondam Senator
                        Chandler of New Hampshire, one of the foremost senators of the nation of his
                        day, was thrown out of office on orders from Mr. Tuttle for the most
                        inconsequential exhibition of independence. And Mr. Tuttle took his orders
                            <pb id="VAA2441-062" n="53"/> from Charles S. Mellen, president of the

                        from J. Pierpont Morgan, the elder, financial master of Wall Street. And Mr.
                        Morgan took his ordersfrom whom? God?</p>

                        as well as every history worthy the name, that the Goulds, Hills, Harrimans,

                        cloud the issue with specious or false arguments, and even presidents and
                        parties faced about, leaving the dreaming, ambitious, hopeful voter to dream
                        on or to seek his so-called constitutional rights in some other vain or
                        ridiculous way. Money has always ruled America, and apparently always will.

                        harried by the very rich as they chose; and still, because he has the ballot

                    <p>The truth is that America has not as yet had an intelligence or a culture
                        worthy the name. It has no visible intellectual purpose, unless it be that
                        of getting money. What little so-called culture we have had, if we have had
                        any, has been borrowed from abroadprincipally England, which itself has
                        needed to be revivified along the lines of true culture; for it, too, as to
                        its written and spoken professions at least, has become puritan, pharisaic,
                        religious and never has been democratic. If you want to see America
                        illustrated rather clearly as to its cultural, or lack of cultural, results
                        contemplate the American millionaire. He had, if he has not now, the
                        prevailing idea that money is power; he worshiped and slaved for it in the
                        hope that it would make him wonderful in the eyes of all men.</p>
                    <p>But consider the pathetic result. He got it. A great war crisis arrived. He
                        wished to be useful with his great (and purely imaginary) power, to do some
                        significant thing which would help the world or at least his country in its
                        hour of stress. Had he the mental or spiritual equipment to see or even feel
                        what was needed? Or was he but one of that immense class of American men and
                        women who discovered in this crisis that business somehow failed to fulfill
                        their spiritual needs and reached out from it, only to find themselves lost
                        in a maze of wider relationships for which they had no technique? Ford
                        organized a peace ship! He, with a little load of editors, journalists,
                        preachers and what not, going to Europe to &quot;call the men out of the
                        trenches by Christmas!&quot; (1915). And the wise American papers,
                        especially in our Middle and Far West, full of his praises, and the
                        probability of success! It could be done! And that, in the face of an
                        amazing and subtle racial movement and propaganda, with war and conquest as
                        its under-stones, organizing in Germany since the year 1813. The rest
                        contented themselves with making more money. So <pb id="VAA2441-064" n="55"
                        /> much for one American business giant&apos;s success, and his
                        intellectual grasp on life!</p>
                    <p>Take yet another phase in conclusion. At the beginning of the great world war
                        we were constantly hearing talk of &quot;the obligations laid upon
                        us,&quot; &quot;our duty to civilization,&quot; the necessity
                        for &quot;making the world safe for democracy,&quot; when, as a
                        matter of fact and according to our chief spokesman&apos;s own admission
                        it was not until between the third and fourth year of the war that we began
                        to realize the true program or purpose of the enemy and that some such
                        enthusiasm as was at first called for might be necessary! We talked of the
                        time having come for us &quot;to play our part among the societies of
                        the world&quot; and then sent a Root and a Francis (corporation lawyers
                        and agents both, and long since discredited by the American people
                        themselves) to argue with the representatives of a torn and war-worn people
                        seeking a new and better form of social and political life. In the war
                        itself it was apparently assumed that &quot;men, money and
                        ships&quot; (the old American idea of quantity, you see, not ideas or
                        wits wherewith to match the deepest schemes of our adversaries as well as
                        our friends) was the point. But life or international politics and relations
                        or diplomacy is something more than that. It may, and did, require nothing
                        less than a mobilization of new characteristics and unique forces on the
                        part of the pacifistic and religious-minded American. It actually compelled
                        him to open his brains to the fact that life is more dark and mysterious
                        than he had supposed, more forceful and terrible and cruel than his petty
                        little pacifistic and puritanic dreams would previously have permitted him
                        to believe. A door was unlocked, a window opened, and looking out or in on
                        the deeps of Nature he sawdimly enough even then, it must be admittedwhat he
                        has not even yet digested; that Nature has no strict and God-given rules,
                        that nothing is really fixed; anything may <pb id="VAA2441-065" n="56"/>
                        arise, and that within the bounds of an unknown arc of equation anything may
                        happenanything.</p>
                    <p>But it took a world horror to crack the armor of smug, ignorant
                        self-sufficiency which has covered the average American from crown to
                        sole.</p>
                    <p>And has he learned? Does life really mean any more to him than it did before?
                        I wonder. As some one else has brilliantly said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;The fierce, rudimentary mass mind of America, like that of some
                        inchoate, primeval monster, relentlessly concentrated in the appetite of the
                        moment, knows nothing as yet apparently of its own vast, inert, almost
                        nerveless body encrusted with parasites. One looks out to-day over the
                        immense vista of our society, stretching westward in a succession of dreary
                        steppes, and one realizes what it means to possess no cultural initiative or
                        tradition, filling in the interstices of energy and maintaining a steady
                        current of life over and above the ebb and flow of individual necessity or
                        animal appetite or purpose.&quot; Money, money, money. To build, build,
                        build, in order to make more money, to make a show, to be better than
                        thoufinancially only. It is told of the quondam Russell Sage that he kept
                        near him in his office a strongbox containing $78,000,000 in what he called
                        &quot;gilt-edge&quot; securities, the which, whenever he wished to
                        prove how wonderful he was and how great his life had been, he brought forth
                        and exclaimed: &quot;Therethere isn&apos;t a man in America who can
                        show that many first-class stocks and bonds! Not one!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And there wasn&apos;t, perhaps.</p>
                    <p>But what of it?</p>
                    <p>He died, and not knowing what to do with it (splendid testimony to the
                        American financial intellect), left it all to his wife; who, old and
                        ignorant herself and not knowing what to do with it, but fearing its
                        senseless distribution, left it, after various benefactions to sectarian
                        schools and much influence <pb id="VAA2441-066" n="57"/> brought to bear, to
                        the Russell Sage Foundation. And the Russell Sage Foundation, not knowing
                        exactly what to do with it, has been &quot;investigating,&quot; and
                        re-investigating and re-re-investigating ever since, this, that and the
                        other, with a view to finding out what it should do with it, what one thing,
                        if any, to help. And what great thing, if any, has the Russell Sage
                        Foundation done?</p>
                    <p>Well, America, in its own peculiar and interesting way, may find itself
                        intellectually. As an old char-woman who worked for me remarked,
                        &quot;I&apos;m not so dumb than I look.&quot; So, possibly and
                        probably, America.</p>
                    <p>To be sure, a new country must at first borrow its culture from somewhere.
                        One does not come by such a thing instanter and out of a silk hat. Still
                        here is a nation now three hundred years old; it has one hundred and twenty
                        millions of people, if not more; it has as great, and in their way forceful,
                        cities as exist anywhere on the globe; its architecture is already most
                        imposing and fast attaining a splendor hitherto never equaled by any land; a
                        far better and more satisfying mechanical equipment is here than in any
                        nation elsewhere. We have, in so far as material facilities are concerned,
                        more and better opportunities for genuine culture than are now available to
                        the mass anywhere. Then, why are we so bent, I should like to know, upon
                        more money, and, when not that, upon idealistically misinterpreting life?
                        The few genuine thinkers that America has thus far produced are taboo: Poe,
                        Whitman, Twain. Only in one field, financenot in war, politics, the arts and
                        sheer intellectdo our essential individuals compare favorably with those of
                        other lands. In the main we are too idealistic or illusioned in all but our
                        material affairs. But why all the delusion <hi rend="i">in re</hi> the
                        ordinary intellectual facts of life? No single nation has more of wealth,
                        courage, industry, or more impressive varieties of scenery, be it of
                        mountains, lakes, valleys, the coast. We should be, and for all I know are
                        (although the <pb id="VAA2441-067" n="58"/> signs are not numerous), at the
                        opening of an era of art and letters such as the world in none of its great
                        periods has surpassed. Yet in spite of all this, and in so far as the mass
                        and its ostensible leaders are concerned, we are intellectually dull and
                        unperceiving in regard to all the basic facts of life. All men are still
                        honest, kind and true (or should be) in America; all women pure as driven
                        snow (or should be) in America. The Sermon on the Mount is our real
                        Constitution; the Ten Commandments our only laws. We all do justly, think
                        kindly, and it is only bad men from the world without, strangers and
                        evil-thinkers, who come from heaven knows wherefor our intellectual and
                        spiritual cosmogony does not admit themto cause us trouble.</p>
                    <p>America in its own good time may come to a great end. And again it may not.
                        It may bewho knows?a mere money machine, a honey-gatherer like the bee, a
                        material welter like Rome, without the slightest vision as to what to do or
                        how to act once it has its great store. Other and shrewder nations, far less
                        able financially or physically, may yet lead the giant by the hand, pull him
                        around by the nose. He may be psychologically the same as the wealthy heir
                        to whom life&apos;s pains and doubts are and remain unknown, who, being
                        pulled in upon expensive pleasures or the ventures of others and given a
                        superficial reason, is cheerfully willing to pay the bill and depart.</p>
                    <p>Well, if so be, so be. Who can help it? Nature, if not man, has a way
                        however, if not wisdom. In the course of time She disposes of nations and
                        their dreams, as well as man and his, by rotting them and their material
                        splendors back into primal chemical substances and forces and forgetting
                        them. Rome has gone; Greece has gone; and many, many another. But speaking
                        for a nation that wishes to stand forth mentally significant among the
                        peoples of the earth, that wishes to lead or at least be among those that
                        lead, must not thoughtintelligent, artistic, accurate visionbe among its
                        primary characteristics? <pb id="VAA2441-068" n="59"/> And is it not
                        possible that as with individuals so with nationswhere the power to think is
                        lacking failure follows? Sometimes, and in view of the careers of various
                        nations past and still present, one is hounded by the thought that as with

                            Professor of Chemistry; Forbes Mitchell, Professor of Philosophy; Abner
                            Barrett, Professor of Physics. Syphers is medium in height, slim, fiery,
                            black-whiskered, barbered to perfection. He is loquacious and
                            demonstrative. Mitchell is at-tenuated, humped, gray. He is quite old.
                            Barrett is fifty, blonde, bald, heavy, silent</hi>.</stage>

                            was an interesting discussion we had, eh? The fact is, Mitchell, as I
                            told you the other day, I have passed out of my old materialistic point
                            of view to a certain extentnot entirelybut now I see more order in
                            things than I once dida necessary if mechanistic order. It seems more or
                            less inescapable to me, doesn&apos;t it to you?</p>

                            kind and another. Nevertheless, there are so many confusing
                            contradictions. Laws seem to conflict at <pb id="VAA2441-070" n="61"/>
                            times, don&apos;t you think, even in chemical and sidereal space.

                        <p>Well, I admit that, too. Only I was merely suggesting that I see more
                            definite order than I once did. A few years ago I could see nothing but
                            disorder, chaos, the inexplicable clashing of forces. Of late I am not
                            so sure. This matter of orthogenesis now; it appeals to me very much as
                            demonstrating an intellectual if not a spiritual order, some great
                            controlling force somewhere. I seem to see a definite tendency to order
                            in things. Life has certainly built itself up through the ages in a very
                            intelligent way indeed, don&apos;t you think?</p>

                            <hi rend="i">(Almost unconscious of interruption.)</hi> I admit that. I
                            admit that. What I am getting at is this: all life, as we know it, is
                            based on the cellcell origination, cell multiplication, cell
                            arrangement. That is an old story. Now here is something which is my own
                            ideait&apos;s a mere theory, of coursethat the whole thing may have
                            been originated, somehow, somewhere else, worked out beforehand, as it
                            were, in the brain of something or somebody and is now being
                            orthogenetically or chemically directed from somewhere, being thrown on
                            a screen, as it were, like a moving-picture, and we mere dot pictures,
                            mere cell-built-up pictures, like the movies, only we are telegraphed or
                            telautographed from somewhere else, like those dot pictures <pb
                                id="VAA2441-071" n="62"/> that are now made electrically, built up
                            dot by dot, millions of them coming rapidly by wireless or wire and
                            being thrown on a screen of some kindether, the elementsyou know what I
                            mean. You have seen the telautograph pictures I mean, of course?</p>

                        <p>Yes, of course. Very ingenious. Very ingenious. But how do you prove the
                            origination of the cell in the fashion that you want?</p>

                        <speaker>SYPHERS</speaker>
                        <p>Well, in this wayit has its drawbacks, of course; you remember the
                            experiments of that Irish scientist Burke, don&apos;t you? He
                            generated what he called a radiobea single cell in a plasm culture which
                            he had hermetically sealed and which he kept under the influence of
                            radium. I do not recall the exact facts of the case at the moment, and I
                            do not believe that his deductions have since been accepted, but that is
                            neither here nor there. That idea of his illustrates mine very well. If
                            we could prove that one cell, one radiobe, had been or could be
                            originated or generated by an outside influence of this kindradium, if
                            you wish, in a plasm of that kindwe would have to admit that the whole
                            thing might be built up in some such fashion. Why, you could base a new
                            philosophy on that, Mitchell. One radiobe generated in a plasm culture
                            under radium or something else, some autogenetic force manifesting
                            itself through a thing like radium, and there you are. After that you
                            would have to grant the possibility of millions and billions of cells
                            coming in that fashion, whole nations constructed of cells, as they have
                            been.</p>

                        <p>There was some hitch in that experiment, however. The chain

                        <p>I knowI know. I grant you that. All I&apos;m insisting on is that if
                            one cell, one radiobe, say, can be generated by a synthesis of energy,
                            why not millions? And if millions, why not billions, the whole human
                            family, in short, since we are a synthesis of cellsthis whole visible
                            scene in all its details? I know it sounds wild, but <hi rend="i">(to

                            might be possible that we were all a part of some invisible psychic

                            just as the cells do in ours.</p>

                        <p>May? May? Of course it may. But how are you going to prove it? I myself
                            have suggested that Mitchell&apos;s larger psychic body, as he calls
                            it, may be nothing more than a fetus, a secondary creature being built
                            in the womb of a still larger organism, but what of it? All of us,
                            everything that we see here, may be nothing more than parts of organs
                            that are being constructed in some huge womb. This so-called higher
                            psychic body may not even be complete yet, not ready to be born in its
                            realm. But how do we know? There&apos;s nothing to prove it.</p>

                        <p>Just the same, if I had a few hundred thousand dollars I would enlarge my
                            laboratory and pursue this subject. I believe that something may be
                            discovered. I believe that I could prove it in the course of time. Why,
                            snow crystals, tree and flower forms, everything, gives us a hint,
                            sometimes instantaneously. <pb id="VAA2441-073" n="64"/> Why do snow
                            crystals assume almost instantaneously and out of nothing their
                            beautiful forms? The controlling impulse is certainly artistic,

                    <head>THE AMERICAN FINANCIER</head>
                    <p>THE long line of American financiers, beginning with Stephen Girard
                        (17501831), and extending via Astor, the Vanderbilts, Goulds, J. P. Morgan
                        and F. W. Woolworth to Henry Ford of the present time, suggests nothing so
                        much as a procession of thrifty and, in the main, cat-like animals weaving a
                        devious way amid intricacies of law and public opinion and theories as to
                        morals, duty, charity and the like, until finally one is led to conclude
                        that, by and large, the financial type is the coldest, the most selfish, and
                        the most useful of all living phenomena. Plainly it is a highly specialized
                        machine for the accomplishment of some end which Nature has in view. Often
                        humorless, shark-like, avid, yet among the greatest constructive forces
                        imaginable; absolutely opposed to democracy in practice, yet as useful an
                        implement for its accomplishment as for autocracy; either ignorant or
                        contemptuous of ethical niceties as related to thine and mine, yet a
                        stickler for all that concerns mine; moral and immoral sexuallyboth types
                        abound; narrow to all but an infinitesimal line in nearly all that relates
                        to the humanities as applied to individuals; wise and generous in the matter
                        of large, even universal benefactions, yet guilty of the meanest subterfuge
                        where their own interests are concerned; and seeking always to perpetuate
                        their own fame. In other words, typical men and women of an avid pagan world
                        (vide Hetty Green, Russell Sage), yet surrounded by religious and ethical
                        abstrusities for which they care little and of which they understand
                        less.</p>
                    <p>Such might be called the pathology of the genus financier, not only in
                        America, but everywhere.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2441-084" n="75"/>
                    <p>In regard to our American specimens it is more or less anachronistic to speak
                        of them as purely American in character, although, in a way, they are. The
                        organizing and financial type of mindAmerican, European or any otheris
                        really little different from that of all preceding countries and ages. Yet
                        financial manipulation, in the extended modern sense, is comparatively new.
                        It dates from the industrial revolution in England in the eighteenth
                        century. There was a time when the organizing type of mind, comparable to
                        our modern examples, was engaged in other things: money-lending and exchange
                        principally. The machinery for finance in the modern sense was lacking. You
                        might have found a J. P. Morgan, a J. D. Rockefeller, or a Russell Sage as
                        Keeper of the Exchequer and Supervisor of the Grain Stores of, say, Egypt or
                        Assyria, or Adviser to the King, whether he ruled in Babylon, Persia or
                        elsewhere. One cannot help thinking what an excellent type of Keeper of the
                        Exchequer, Vizier or High Priest our own John D. Rockefeller would have
                        made. The robes! The sanctity!</p>
                    <p>As we come forward in history to the end of the Roman Empire and the
                        beginning of that mental darkness known as the Middle Ages, when all
                        intelligence, financial and other, seems to have been completely swept away,
                        we find the purely financial and organizing type but slowly developing.
                        Joseph (he of the coat of many colors), fabled Croesus, who ruled in Asia
                        Minor, and Lepidus and Maecenas, friends of triumvirs, emperors and poets,
                        are excellent examples of the ancient financial type. Their like is not to
                        be found until after the revival of banking and trade in the fifteenth
                        century. And if you look back you will see that to-day, in another way, we
                        have been repeating in Wall Street (or were until a few years ago), the type
                        of man who occasionally sat as Emperor over all the Romans. If you are
                        inclined to doubt this you might, if the opportunity offered, examine the
                        collection of portrait busts of Roman Emperors of the highly executive and
                        financial type <pb id="VAA2441-085" n="76"/> (Hadrian, Trajanus, Titus,
                        Caracalla and the rest) in the Vatican, the Musee del la Terme and the
                        British Museum. Hadrian, for instance, was as much like the late Commodore
                        Vanderbilt, side whiskers and all, as one man might be to another; and
                        Trajanus greatly resembled the late Mark Hanna, whose name somehow suggests
                        that of a Roman. Any one of ten or fifteen portrait busts of ancient Roman
                        Emperors might almost be mistaken for Armour, Morgan, Gould, Sage, Crocker,
                        Stanford, Hearst. For example, compare Russell Sage to Julius Caesar; or Wm.
                        H. Vanderbilt to Augustus Caesar. Indeed, if you were to examine some of the
                        major operations of the successful Roman Emperors you would find that their
                        power to maintain their positions with the Praetorian Guard and the
                        Patrician Class (which was really the Roman world, so far as they were
                        concerned) was largely financial and organizing in the same peculiar spirit
                        in which we find those qualities operating to-day.</p>
                    <p>It is not until the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in Italy,
                        Flanders and north Germany that one encounters financial types very like
                        those with which we have been very recently dealing. Italy of the
                        Renaissance found a most interesting specimen of this type of mind in Cosimo
                        I. of the Medici&quot;Pater Patriae,&quot; as he was calledwho was
                        little more than a very active Vanderbilt I. of his day. The family first
                        conducted a successful pill business, then Cosimo engaged in the banking
                        business. Being a financier he secured control of nearly all the financial
                        channels of Italy, France, Greece, a portion of Egypt, and the Lowlands, It
                        is charged that he brought about the death of one or two enemies in
                        Florence, not because he disliked them, but because he thought they were
                        dangerous to his interests, and once he came very near to being gibbeted
                        himself. He was a patron of the arts, not so much because he was emotionally
                        and poetically enthusiastic about art as because, as at present, it was a
                        distinguished thing to <pb id="VAA2441-086" n="77"/> be. The trick of
                        currying favor via art patronage is old. His descendants, having less of his
                        force and more of the refinement which invariably follows wealth, did more
                        for art and less for trade, and so while we see the Medici family identified
                        with the most brilliant period of Italian art we also see it slowly sinking
                        into financial and political insignificance. That it finally degenerated and
                        passed out is no reflection on the significance of Cosimo, his primary
                        import. Although the coldest and most financial of them all, he was also the
                        best.</p>
                    <p>This was equally true of Louis XIV of France and Frederick the Great of
                        Germany, organizing and financial types both, although monarchs by
                        birth.</p>
                    <p>England has had its full share of the type in the officers and directors of
                        its famous East India Company (Warren Hastings, for one) and their efforts
                        to monopolize and exploit the Indian Empire, as well as in the very
                        excellent Rothschild, who flourished at the time of the Battle of Waterloo
                        and who stood behind a tree to view the battle in order that he might decide
                        for himself which side was going to win and so get to London and the
                        stock-market first. There he spread the report that England had lost so that
                        the already trembling stocks of the nation might tumble and he be able to
                        buy them for a song. When he had gathered in all the shares he could carry
                        he gave out the correct news of the victory and reaped his harvest.
                        Dishonest? As you choose to look at such things. But when has high finance
                        been honest, or let us say, considerate of the interests of others? The
                        financial history of this particular individual is so selfishly
                        single-minded as to be almost ridiculous, suggesting a power which invents
                        man for one purpose and no other, as generals, saints and the like are
                        invented.</p>
                    <p>In America, the history of our financiers is so full of thievery and
                        selfishness as to appear comic were it not for the mass misery which so many
                        of their deeds involved. Stephen <pb id="VAA2441-087" n="78"/> Girard, for
                        instance, stole his employers&apos; ship at the outbreak of the American
                        Revolution (pretending it had been sunk, of course), and with the proceeds
                        opened a wine and cider business in Philadelphia. John Jacob Astor drugged
                        the Indians with fire-water and bought their furs for a song, as well as
                        bribed Government agents to permit him so to do. J. P. Morgan senior at the
                        outbreak of the Civil War sold the Government five hundred of its own
                        condemned rifles for twenty-two dollars each, after having but the moment
                        before bought them from the Government for three dollars and fifty cents
                        each, and that with money borrowed on the strength of the proposed contract.
                        (History of the Great American Fortunes, Myers, Vol. II., page 172.)
                        Cornelius Vanderbilt blackmailed the United States Steamship Company, plying
                        between New York and California, in the amount of nearly $500,000 a year by
                        threatening to operate a rival line. (Ibid. Vol. II., pp. 120121.) Jay Gould
                        robbed the various States through which his railroad ran and drove some of
                        his rivals to suicide. Russell Sage robbed the city of Troy of a railroad
                        and bribed the Minnesota and other State Legislatures. (Ibid. Vol II., pp.
                        1216.) The record is too long to be more than mentioned here; those
                        interested should read Myers&apos; remarkable work, in which the crimes
                        as well as genius of our long line of money kings are described in full.</p>
                    <p>That the world has always been troubled with the huge financial innovator and
                        the self-seeker is of course a commonplace; the objection to him has been,
                        as a rule, that he has too few human traits. Like the astronomer, the
                        mathematician, the philosopher and the historian, his thoughts are more or
                        less remote from the concerns of the ordinary individual, although his
                        dealings are with him. To do anything which is to be of benefit to the
                        individual it requires the mind that sees the individual en masse rather
                        than in particular. Indeed, the thing that has always confronted the
                        individual of ability since the <pb id="VAA2441-088" n="79"/> beginning,
                        aside from his own inner driving emotions, ambitions and needs, is this same
                        organized need of the mass as represented constitutions, governments,
                        declarations, which in order to advantage himself he must flatter, satisfy
                        or exploitbut which he must meet in some way or fail. And only when the
                        organized sense of the mass becomes sufficiently intelligent for it to act
                        in concert is it possible to sweep away or even curb the individual. For the
                        individual and the mass are interdependent facts, and the one cannot escape
                        the other, try as each may.</p>
                    <p>But never, apparently, previous to the French Revolution, which was a revolt
                        against centralized and hereditary constructive craft and ingenuity, had it
                        occurred to the world, or rather the mass, to rout these individuals and
                        make pariahs of them, although the world in recent days has developed an
                        especial aptitude for it, one must admit. England, which is not so much a
                        democracy as an ordered hierarchy of powers, largely financial in character,
                        has never felt called upon to drive these gentlemen from their positions or
                        quarrel with them for the often singular and fantastic manner in which they
                        have achieved their success, or the indifference they may have displayed
                        toward the millions below them. The gentlemen at the top may or may not have
                        intentionally done anything for the peasants at the bottom in the past, but
                        until very recent days they have not been asked to relinquish their control
                        of the machinery. Yet now the world presents another angle to this
                        proposition: the organizer and financier is being suspected and harried
                        everywhere. Only in America, the home of anti-financial legislation, the
                        multi-millionaire is apparently becoming safer than ever and more powerful.
                        Yet to the economist, the historian, the student of politics, it is already
                        a truism that economic reforms are not and never have been permanent; also
                        that no one, however self-interested, ever succeeds wholly in working for
                        himself. <pb id="VAA2441-089" n="80"/> He must do something for the mass if
                        he is to do anything for himself. It is a condition of life, not a
                        theory.</p>
                    <p>The trouble in America, in so far as this type of mind is or was concerned,
                        is or was this: that when it appeared it came rather speedily and roughly
                        into contact with the pen-written notion or ideal embodied in our American
                        Declaration that all men are born free and equal, and that they are
                        possessed of certain inalienable rights, among which of course are those of
                        life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And these latter were not
                        supposed to be interfered with by financiers or organizers seeking power.
                        Yet the race has always been, and will so remain, of course, to the swift,
                        the battle to the strong; chemical and physical laws not being easily upset
                        by fiats of government. Time and chance still continue to operate as before,
                        sometimes to destroy the strong, sometimes to destroy the weak. The best
                        that can be said for the theories laid down in the American Declaration is
                        that they do more credit to the hearts of those who penned them than to
                        their heads. Yet that these sentiments so expressed should have moved to
                        bring about a conflict between the American individual and the American mass
                        might well have been foreseen, although curiously it has not yet done so.
                        Other countries without any Declaration are far more alive to their
                        inalienable (so-called) rights than is America, if one may judge by recent
                        developments in Russia and elsewhere. All good things may be and, no doubt,
                        are gifts, but they are not conferred by governments, any more than death
                        and disaster can be prevented by governments. Sometimes innate strength and
                        fortuitous circumstances help some of us, yet this merely illustrates once
                        more the truism that nature &quot;plays favorites&quot; and that
                        many are vastly better equipped than others.</p>
                    <p>A great voice, for instance, is a gift, and cannot be acquired at any school
                        or for any price; the beauty of a woman, however modest or staggering, is a
                        gift and cannot be purchased <pb id="VAA2441-090" n="81"/> or even
                        manufactured (amazing as that may seem in the face of all the drug
                        companies), although ugliness, apparently, can almost be wished on a person,
                        so lavish is life with its disfavors. The ability to paint a great picture,
                        to design a great building, to lead an army, to organize a government, to
                        construct a philosophy, to dream a religion, is a gift and cannot be added
                        to any one by taking thought, however quickly it may be taken away. Neither
                        can the possessors of these be reduced to the level of those who have
                        nothing to offer, no ideas, no dreams. Christ said one really significant
                        thing, &quot;Who by taking thought can add a cubit to his
                        stature?&quot; If He had followed the logic of that statement He would
                        never have delivered the Sermon on the Mount or the Beatitudes and would not
                        now be so popular, but apparently He was genius enough to be illogical.</p>
                    <p>What has confronted the American organizing genius, now known as a captain of
                        industry, a multi-millionaire, a financier and the like, has beenaside from
                        a mass need for this, that and the other and his desire to supply it in
                        order that he might improve his own condition, strengthen his own
                        individuality, etc.this same pen-written theory about all men being free and
                        equal. Free they might be to begin with, one might hear him saying to
                        himselfto a very limited extent, anyhowbut equal to himself, however much
                        they might be equal one to another, never. It became his business,
                        therefore, as he soon found and as he afterwards phrased it, to
                        &quot;drive a horse and wagon through the Constitution,&quot; or
                        indeed any other law that might be devised to stop him and his dreams. I do
                        not believe that any financial genius, American or other, anywhere or at any
                        time, ever stopped to consider that there was such a thing as law or a
                        Declaration of Independence or a Constitution when he began; or, if he did,
                        it was as something to be evaded or overcome. To the aggressive organizing
                        mind life is and always has been <pb id="VAA2441-091" n="82"/> a free and
                        practically uncharted sea. It finds Itself blazing with an impulse to get
                        some one new thing done; it conceives some great scheme, is inspired with
                        some great enthusiasm for something; and thereafter all else is as nothing.
                        Being strong and magnetic and enthusiastic, it rushes in where it is
                        generally assumed angels fear to tread and seizes upon all which it deems
                        may aid it in its dreams. The average man is of as little significance to
                        such a temperament as a stalk of grain to a reaper. Any ideal other than its
                        own is likely to be looked upon as an impediment. But always, of course,
                        there exists the tramping mass of lesser individuals who have been going to
                        school and church and there learning (in America at least) all the religious
                        and copy-book maxims, which argue that the world was made for the individual
                        and that he was born free and equal, each as good as any other and each
                        called upon to aid the other; and these begrudge, and always have and always
                        will, these great giants their power. They often fight them and sometimes
                        beat them.</p>
                    <p>But they are not to be wholly undone by them at any time, anywhere. Like the
                        Lilliputians, the mass as often succeeds in binding Gulliver with their
                        threads as Gulliver succeeds in tearing through their petty stays. The twain
                        are ever being born side by side in nature; the giant and the pygmy, the
                        shark and the bluefish, the whale and the minnow. &quot;Look,&quot;
                        cry the minnows to their fellows, &quot;this whale imagines he is
                        better, wiser, greater, than we! He moves in larger ways, disturbs our great
                        sea, taking his choice of the realms and pleasures of life. Why should this
                        be? Are we not as good as he? And yet he does all these things which we
                        cannot; he breaks the law which governs the average minnow, whereas we
                        cannot. Therefore he must be evil We will seize and bind him and so end his
                        privileges, if not him.&quot; Immediately and always, at this point,
                        there arises an intermediate figure or group, the sophisticated
                        &quot;advocates of the people,&quot; &quot;tribunes of the
                        people,&quot; <pb id="VAA2441-092" n="83"/> individuals less powerful
                        than the giants, though shrewder than the pygmies, their employers, many of
                        whom are sincere enough in their conviction of unselfishness; others
                        self-seekers and charlatans purely, yet each and every one crying that he
                        will deliver the mass from its bondage, and actually attempting, or
                        pretending, to adjust the impossible demands of the people with the almost
                        impossible individualism of the egoist. But, honest or dishonest as they may
                        be, the mass is never made quite free; the financiers or individuals are
                        never wholly curbed. Both merely proceed to develop new issues and new
                        battlefields.</p>
                    <p>Personally I believe that most of us would prefer that the mass should not
                        sweep away the individual, for each of us would prefer to be somebody in
                        however small a way rather than mere unrecognizable cogs in a machine or
                        bees in a beehive. At best, we are little more than that; even our greatest
                        individuals, individual as they may seem. They, too, are but minute factors
                        in the total machinery, little able to forefend against disaster or the
                        ultimate nothingness that swallows them. But one thing is sure: the
                        individual in the course of the development of his dreams and ambitions does
                        scheme out and construct or bring into organic operation functions which are
                        valuable to mass prosperity, and on that score there is scarcely any fault
                        to be found with him.</p>
                    <p>The thing that might seriously concern a thinking American would be whether
                        the American financial type, as contrasted with those of other lands and
                        times, is more or less admirable. Greece had Croesus; Rome, Lepidus,
                        Hadrian; Italy, Lorenzo, the money-gathering Popes; France, Louis XIV, the
                        Baron de Hirsch; England, the first Rothschild, the late Cecil Rhodes,
                        Harmsworth, Strathcona; Japan, Shibusawa.</p>
                    <p>While it may be admitted that the organizing types developed in America have
                        not had any too great charm or virtue (Astor I., Vanderbilt I, Gould, Sage,
                        Harriman, Morgan), still they appear to compare favorably with most ancients
                            <pb id="VAA2441-093" n="84"/> and moderns. If they have done less for
                        the arts, as many seem to think, socially, or at least economically, they
                        have done as much if not more than their predecessors. Astor I. may have
                        begrudged a washerwoman fifty cents, dunned his tenants for rent, debauched
                        the Indians, but he opened up the most remote portions of America and laid
                        the way for roads and railroads. The first Vanderbilt was no doubt a brutal,
                        cruel and savage man, but he had the vision which made a transcontinental
                        railroad possible. His greed and vanity made it possible. As much might be
                        said for Gould, Russell Sage and Harriman, though the picture of Sage
                        keeping apples in his desk to avoid buying lunches for his friends or
                        well-wishers and using his old plug hats for umbrella stands in order to get
                        a little more wear out of them could not be of much interest to the mass
                        except in a Dickensian sense. Unless one accepts the subtleties of Nature as
                        one finds them, sees in all an inexplicable and yet biologic or universally
                        constructive plan, and in these riant and lawless individuals a scheme of
                        hers to achieve something quickly, there is nothing very admirable or even
                        explicable about the dark goings to and fro of such types as the late J. P.
                        Morgan, H. H. Rogers, Thomas F. Ryan, William C. Whitney, or any of a score
                        of other large fortune-builders so recently in control of stupendous matters
                        here and elsewhere. They are not explicable save as motivating forces in the
                        hands or will of higher powersgood, bad or indifferent. Seen at close range
                        they are more suggestive of sharks and we of sniveling bluefish, and it is
                        plainly to our best interests either to keep out of their way or unite
                        firmly to oppose them in whatever way we can, unless we choose to be
                        promptly eaten.</p>
                    <p>Yet are they any worse than their prototypes anywhere? The worst that can be
                        said for the American is that as yet no one of him has been able to rival
                        Lorenzo the Magnificent or Louis XIV to gather and use in any marked way,
                        supposing <pb id="VAA2441-094" n="85"/> there has been anything of
                        importance to use, the significant artistic personalities and materials
                        (American or general) of his time after the fashion, say, of a Lorenzo, a
                        Hadrian or a Can Grande. Perhaps he has had few opportunities, no
                        Michelangelos to countenance or foster, no Raphaels or Leonardos to attach
                        to his court or entourage. Again it may be urged that he has never been in
                        any position to organize or dictate, being by no means in any free or
                        superior position in a democracy such as this. The best he has been able to
                        do apparently is to buy, although of course the power to patronize nobly and
                        generously has to a certain extent been within his range. Still, a stranger
                        to our rich and powerful land might (I do not say he would) be struck by the
                        abject poverty of a Poe or a Whitman, scarcely knowing which way to turn for
                        means, as contrasted with the enormous affluence of so many financial
                        geniuses. Why, one such might ask, should either a writer or poet of the
                        transcendent merit of either of these have lacked a financial sponsor? And
                        why, the same inquiring mind might ask, was there no Maecenas to befriend
                        the late George Inness, Harris Merton Lyon, or MacDowell, the musician? But
                        in other waysvia libraries, gifts to art museums, schools and universitieshe
                        would have to admit that the American multimillionaire has done quite as
                        well as the others; only, in so far as I can see, he has in the main lacked
                        the insight to connect his gifts with an impulse toward the truest art
                        values and realms of mental freedom and refinement. Too often, as in the
                        case of our universities, his gifts have been far too subtly identified,
                        aside from purely technical progress, with mental retrogression, or at least
                        the perpetuation of religious and moralistic dogma not compatible with the
                        truest mental development. At the same time the retort might be that it has
                        never been a part of the organizing ability of any money genius anywhere to
                        plan for true mental progress. It may <pb id="VAA2441-095" n="86"/> not be
                        necessary. Life may be taking care of that &quot;on its own&quot; as
                        the phrase runs.</p>
                    <p>However that may be, one cannot help thinking how interesting it would have
                        been if in New York or elsewhere any one of the above-mentioned men had in
                        his day troubled togather about him in some private court a representative
                        group of intellectual and artistic personalities, for the sole purpose of
                        testifying to his interest in that side of life, if nothing more. After all,
                        the living individual is worth something, and any one of our financiers
                        might have done what no American of wealth, as far as I know, has as yet
                        done: invested some of his boundless wealth in personality. Or he might have
                        endowed a wholly independent magazine or newspaper or theatre, of which
                        there is at present not one, or a school of special learning free from
                        dogmatic interference, or a publishing house, or a university which should
                        have been a true university and not one devoted to the economic or social or
                        religious theories or moods of any particular period. The strangest lack or
                        flaw in the American organizing financial temperament, in so far as I can
                        see, is or has been, hitherto, its inability to see either character or
                        significance in anything save movements which tend to further the most
                        material financial aims: railroads, butcher-companies, electricity, gas,
                        typewriter and other purely mechanical or material organizations. Yet
                        possibly, up to the present time, the land has only needed things of this
                        kind. And perhaps the next generation will make amends. Who knows? Thus far
                        there has been little if any tendency to invest in anything save such art or
                        art forms as have been heralded by time.</p>
                    <p>To this day, ancient Asiatic, Egyptian and European art forms continue to
                        pour in on us in a brilliant phantasmagoric stream, until we threaten, or
                        did, to drain the world of its treasures. Our private mansions groan with
                        the antiquated skill of Asia and other continents, but of these other
                        matters, or the cultivation or preservation of a single living personality,
                            <pb id="VAA2441-096" n="87"/> not a word. It is possible to go forth and
                        raise any reasonable or even unreasonable sum for any number of useless or
                        surplus charitable organizations or hospitals or churches, whereas if it
                        were a question of cash for a truly civilizing movement of some kind, or a
                        personality, the obstacles would prove well nigh insurmountable. Some of the
                        trashiest homes I have ever had the misery of beholding have been those of
                        men of tremendous wealth and alleged refinement, stuffed to overflowing with
                        bogus furniture and art. Yet, when all is said and done, are they to blame?
                        Are they not specialized machines sent here for a purpose? And should one
                        expect more? Verily we have our reward in their practical
                        achievements....Yet, also, when one looks at them one cannot help
                        remembering that Walt Whitman lived in a back street in Camden and depended
                        upon a friendly admirer to bring him a fish for his supper; that Poe lived
                        in a hut in the woods, unable to achieve or afford a more suitable abode. I
                        am not quarreling; I cite these as interesting facts.</p>
                    <p>An interviewer once questioning me in regard to the significance of the
                        American financial type (it was just after I had published &quot;The
                        Financier&quot;), raised the question as to whether the American
                        financial type, then so abundant and powerful, had ethically the right to be
                        as it was or do as it was doing, seeing that it was being and doing about as
                        it pleased. My answer was, and I still see no reason for changing it, that,
                        in spite of all the so-called laws and prophets, there is apparently in
                        Nature no such thing as the right to do or the right not to do, if you reach
                        the place where the significance of the social chain in which you find
                        yourself is not satisfactory. The murderer has under the written law no
                        right to murder anybody. It is perfectly plain that he has the right if he
                        is willing to pay the penalty, or if he can evade it. Conscience, this thing
                        called conscience to which people repeatedly appeal, is, as I have <pb
                            id="VAA2441-097" n="88"/> pointed out elsewhere, little more than a
                        built-up net of social acceptances and agreements in regard to society or
                        the agreed state of facts in which we all find ourselves when we arrive
                        here; in other words all the things which we wish to do and be, or avoid. It
                        is not anything save an inherent condition of balance in Nature which
                        desires and achieves a very rough equation, but nothing which works exact
                        justice to any individual anywhere. The so-called &quot;still, small
                        voice,&quot; ever present at one&apos;s inner or spiritual ear, is,
                        if it is anything at all, a sense of self-preservation and conditional
                        desire for equation or peace stillness, rest, lack of friction.</p>
                    <p>It is true that the individual may not always agree with the ethics of his
                        time, or that he may smack of anything but sweetness and light, may even
                        seem a little gross or terrible; but if he prove essential, as he nearly
                        always does, his revolt against the commonplace fixity, rigidity and the
                        like of the slower-moving man cannot be looked upon as either wholly evil or
                        in vain. Indeed, if he did no more than throw a new light on this strange
                        phantasmagory called existence, then, ethics or no ethics, he would have
                        been worth while and it would make no essential difference whether he agreed
                        with passing theories or not. Apparently the world, or let us say the race,
                        is moving along in some curious way to possibly a larger, more widespread
                        condition of complexity and articulation, part with part (variety in unity,
                        unity in variety), and a self-sen-sating intellectual perception and
                        appreciation of the same. Who knows? But beyond that, what? Is man better,
                        purer, more spiritual, more generous than ever he was? Do any of the savages
                        or animals lack any of the emotional or charitable traits which we possess?
                        Observe the wolf with its young; the cat; the dog; the lion. Are not all
                        swayed by conditioning laws of subsistence and which they obey, but nothing
                        more? True, they kill to eat, to preserve themselves. Has man ever done
                        lessor more?</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2441-098" n="89"/>
                    <p>Any naturalistic philosopher can, of course, trace all the steps for you, how
                        it is that you have come to be seemingly so different, although he cannot
                        tell you why or where you are going. My own guess would be that we, or
                        rather the race, is going on to a greater individuality, plus a greater
                        weakness as to its component and clinging atoms, providing it does not
                        suffer an endless dark age of mass control or total extinction in some form
                        or other. Nietzsche appeared preaching individuality, greater individuality
                        for everybody who could achieve it, and to a certain extent he was right.
                        Greater individuality than the world has yet seen will certainly be achieved
                        by some. Schopenhauer, before him, announced that only failure for the
                        individual was possible, and to a certain extent he was right also. The two
                        saw the over-soul from different angles. Again, Marx, the humanitarian,
                        appeared preaching solidarity for the mass and mass control, and his work
                        will probably result in greater material battles between the individual and
                        the mass than any yet witnessed. If one stands with the individualists, as
                        one may well do. and believes that there are no laws created by mass
                        conditions and necessities which the individual should not be allowed to
                        break for the subsequent good of the mass, and also that the mass only moves
                        forward because of the services of the exceptional individual, then one will
                        be compelled to agree with Nietzsche that it is folly not to wish that the
                        significant individual will always appear and will always do what his
                        instincts tell him to do. On the other hand if one feels, as so many of the
                        less well-equipped do, that in the long run and in the plan of Nature itself
                        the individual is nothing, the type all, and that mass conditions favoring
                        the production of many of the best type are most important, then the airs
                        and dreams of the individual in regard to his personal satisfaction and
                        satiation will not seem so important, the general welfare of each individual
                        of the mass more important than anything else. And this will <pb
                            id="VAA2441-099" n="90"/> mean that always the special individual, the
                        genius of any kind, will be curbed and restrained if not actually pushed
                        into the background. And, in the main, life proves this nearly all the time.
                        Attempts at world domination on the part of one individual and another have
                        proved failures, as witness Darius, Alexander, Hannibal, Napoleon, the
                        Kaiser.</p>
                    <p>Yet theories and doxies wear thin with the course of time, and the
                        &quot;still, small voice&quot; of one age is not the
                        &quot;still, small voice&quot; of the next, strange as it may seem.
                        At best, all we have is the individual, not always financial, by any means,
                        or artistic, but one who has dreamed out something: music, a picture,
                        poetry, a machine, a railroad, an empireanything, in short, that man as race
                        or nation can use or rejoice in. If to have a Woolworth Building, a
                        transcontinental railroad, a Panama Canal, a flying machine, to say nothing
                        of literature and art, means that we must endure a man who is dull, greedy,
                        vain, ridiculous in many ways or even an advocate of every conceivable vice
                        in order to twist his brain into some strange phantasmagorical tendency, the
                        result of which will be some one of these things, there are many who would
                        enthusiastically say, &quot;Then let us have him along with all his
                        lacks or vices, in order that this other may be.&quot; If it is a
                        question of having a Villon or not, provided we cannot have him without
                        having a thief at the same time, then the same or another group would cry,
                        &quot;Let us have the thief and the poem concerning the &apos;Snows
                        of Yesterday.&apos;&quot; For my part I am convinced that so-called
                        vice and crime and destruction and so-called evil are as fully a part of the
                        universal creative process as are all the so-called virtues, and do as much
                        goodproviding, as they do, for one thing, the religionist and the moralist
                        with their reasons for existing. At best, ethics and religion are but one
                        face of a shield which is essentially irreligious and unethical as to its
                        other face, or the first would not exist.</p>
                    <p>For myself, then, I cannot say that personally or socially the <pb
                            id="VAA2441-100" n="91"/> American or any other financier, as I have
                        investigated him, is not as satisfactory as may be, all things considered.
                        Artistically thus far he is not much to survey, but a giant or a Titan he
                        certainly has been. As for the majority of them, they were by no means
                        presentable or even acceptable socially, but what would you? They were, in
                        the main, too ignorant, too insistent on their own views, too
                        self-hypnotized by their own dreams of self-advancement and dominance. A
                        leader of polite society anywhere, for instance, might not be willing to
                        welcome a Russell Sage, a Jay Gould, or a John W, Gates or his wife, or
                        indeed any other American financial type thus far known, and this solely on
                        the ground of expediency or social or artistic fitness or unfitness for the
                        lighter forms of living, but that in itself proves nothing. It could
                        truthfully be said, on the other hand, that it would scarcely be possible to
                        admit the average society man to the threatening precincts of radical energy
                        or thought in any form. One thing is sure: the individual cannot wholly
                        understand the mass, nor the mass the individual. Both have their
                        significance, their place, but if one were to say of either that it or he
                        alone had claim to significance as a helpful factor in life, or as dramatic
                        or artistic material, or as a spectacle, one would be greatly mistaken. Both
                        have. All have.</p>

                        </lg>
                        <p>THE toil of the laborer is artless. There is in it neither form, nor
                            color, nor tone. For months I have been working as only workingmen work,
                            and in the dreary round of the hours it has come to me that the thing
                            which is weari some and disheartening about it is that it is utterly
                            devoid of art. In the construction of a building, for instance, whereat
                            we labored for three long months, I discovered that with each
                            day&apos;s labor I was in contact only with that which was formless
                            and colorless and toneless. Huge, misshapen, disheartening piles of
                            brick; commonplace, indifferent and colorless masses of stone, wood,
                            iron, sand, cement; bone and sinew of what was to be, but in themselves
                            devoid of all that could appeal to the eye or touch the heart, and
                            scattered about in such an aimless way as to bring to the mind nothing
                            but a wearying sense of disorder. This disorder, however, as soon became
                            clear to me, was not apparent in a definite way to all those who worked
                            amidst it. These mixers of mortar and carriers of brick toiled in the
                            grime and dust without seeming to realize that it was a wretched
                            condition, hard, grim and, so far as the sum of their individual lives
                            was concerned, but meagerly profitable. Carpenters, <pb id="VAA2441-102"
                                n="93"/> masons and iron-workers went sturdily about their labors,
                            but the artless and unlovely nature of their work was over it all, and
                            despite their seeming unconsciousness to it one felt the drag of its
                            absence, their eagerness to get away, their innate yearning to be where
                            things were not in the making, the urge to be out in the larger and more
                            perfect world where form and color and tone do abound.</p>
                        <p>For, after all, in the main, things do stand complete, as we see them.
                            The hills have their enduring roundness, the trees their perpetual
                            forms. Landscapes and skylines are not torn and scraped as in the
                            vicinity of some (comparatively) minute constructive labor. Nature is
                            nearly always cunningly pleasing to the eye on the surface, whatever may
                            go on below whereas the average constructive processes are so often
                            discordant, broken, disordered.</p>
                        <p>Seeing this, and not being able in my own consciousness to explain why,
                            my heart was sad and I wondered why life should be thus grimly
                            organized; why formlessness in the parts of the thing to be formed; why
                            tonelessness in that which when laboriously organized would be all tone;
                            why colorlessness in that which in the end would enliven the heart with
                            color and dance before the eye a perfect thing.</p>
                        <p>In the progress of the work, however, it was given me to see that, in the
                            production of all things here, there is at bottom this very formlessness
                            innate. For to organize and perfect one thing we must take from and
                            destroy another; and in doing that we fly in the face of that which we
                            most desire: order and harmony. Therefore, if we would have that which
                            the inexplicable urge for something new and more beautiful commands, we
                            must apparently steel our hearts against the old and destroy it,
                            although, having committed the offense of destruction, we must repay or
                            balance by the labor of construction.</p>
                        <p>It is not given to all of us to follow the ramifications of <pb
                                id="VAA2441-103" n="94"/> Nature&apos;s planning nor to see
                            wherein justice or the seeming injustice lies. Most of those about
                            meaverage short-reasoning creaturestook their labor drearily enough and
                            were not able to see in any definite inspiriting way the approaching
                            beauty of that which their hands were building. It did not concern them.
                            Many of them came and labored but a little while, doing but a minute
                            portion of that which was to be the whole, seeing only the mass and
                            chaos of it without ever obtaining one glimpse of the loveliness which
                            was to be.</p>
                        <p>But when the labor had been completed, when the mortar had been mixed and
                            the brick and stone removed from their uneven masses and set in order,
                            when the wounds of the earth had been smoothed over, the scattered
                            debris removed and the grass allowed to grow, when in the light of the
                            restful evening there rose, in this instance, high in the air a perfect
                            tower, buttressed, arched and pinnacled, with here a window reflecting
                            the golden Western glow and there a pillar standing out in delicate
                            relief against the perfect background of the sky, the meaning of the
                            chaos came home. Here it was: color, form, tone, beauty. The labor of
                            the excavator, the toil of the iron-worker, the irritating beats of the
                            carpenters&apos; hammers, the mess and disorder of the field of
                            action, had all blended together finally and made this perfect thingonly
                            they were no longer a part of it. To most of them it was all but
                            meaningless. Having labored on but portions of it they could scarcely
                            conceive it as a whole.</p>
                        <p>And yet as I looked my heart rose up, and I, for one, was thankful to
                            have been in part a worker, to have worked a little, to have wearied a
                            little, to have sighed a little, that so lovely a thing might be.</p>

                        <p>The toil of the laborer is thoughtless. There is in it neither conception
                            nor initiative nor the development of that which <pb id="VAA2441-104"
                                n="95"/> is new. Though the hands labor and the body bend, the heart
                            is not in it. It is all a weariness and a travail of the flesh, and the
                            profit is unseen.</p>
                        <p>In a certain factory, not far from the heart of the city of New York, I
                            worked as a laborer. My duty was to carry shavings and lumber and to
                            sweep the floor. All day, from the blowing of the whistle at seven in
                            the morning to its welcome blast at six at night, my body was busy
                            bending and lifting in the effort to keep the floor clean of shavings
                            and supplying a half-dozen machines with lumber. The slow, unchanging,
                            imperative nature of the work, the fact that I went on whether one man
                            came or another one stayed away, the dreary persistence with which it
                            was necessary to repeat the same motion day after day, week after week,
                            month after month, year after year, was, to the thinking and restless
                            mind, maddening.</p>
                        <p>In this factory at the time there ruled a foreman well fitted to the
                            scheme of things. He was a strange, egotistic, vainglorious soul, with a
                            mind so set up by the fact that he had been foreman of this little shop
                            that there was no living with him. He was arbitrary; his word was law.
                            With an air that might have become a tragedian, he walked about his
                            domain and glared upon each and all, meditating upon his exalted
                            position. Every word was either a command or a reproof, and in times of
                            excitement or depression, such as naturally flow from the hurry or the
                            lack of work, he was always about, venting his humor or wrath, as his
                            mood dictated.</p>
                        <p>This situation, coupled with the meager wages, the enormous wealth of the
                            corporation which controlled it all, the utter indifference of those who
                            sat at the top to those who worked at the bottom, was a difficult thing
                            to endure. It was so very apparent to any one who thought that the work
                            of those at the bottom was entirely without point save as a means of <pb
                                id="VAA2441-105" n="96"/> subsistence. To lift and carry, to move
                            along given lines and within certain limitsthis was the sum and
                            substance of wisdom required, and it mattered little who did it. Some
                            small personal characteristics figured in, such as whether a man was
                            naturally quick or slow, good-humored or ill-humored and the like, but
                            the main point was to do the work as conceived, planned, initiated and
                            developed by some one above. And this could be acquired until it was not
                            a matter of thought but of rote. What you thought or how you felt was
                            not involved.</p>
                        <p>One of its pathetic aspects was that it was involved with the maintenance
                            of a condition which was not necessarily beneficial or worthy of
                            approval. So many of the owners, for whom these thousands upon thousands
                            of individuals labored, were mere idlers in society, social loafers,
                            daily bulletined as the chief factors in a dozen trivial amusements, and
                            as wholly unconscious of this under-condition which made for their
                            situation and pleasure as if it did not exist at all. For every motion
                            and bending here, some one else was deriving the privilege not to move
                            or bend there. It was as if some untoward power were momentarily taking
                            something from each of these and giving it to some one who did not even
                            know whence it came.</p>
                        <p>And the saddest part of it was that these toilers, born for the most part
                            to a condition and with brains unsuited to anything much better, were
                            still not so dull that they could not see, and that rather plainly, how
                            scurvily Nature was using them, with what a vast, contemptuous
                            indifference. It was little to Her whether they lived or died, did
                            poorly or well. Most of them were mere machines who had acquired the
                            little they knew by observing others, who, if they were capable of
                            thinking at all, were restricted by the nature of their labor in
                            utilizing thought, and yet they could see so plainly that those above
                            them did very little or nothing, and received much, <pb id="VAA2441-106"
                                n="97"/> so much more. It was one of those situations in which
                            labor, a mere round of motions, took the place of thought and left them
                            weary and disinterested at the close of the day, not fit to originate a
                            thought if it had been possible or necessary.</p>
                        <p>And yet, after a time, it occurred to me that it was not, perhaps, so
                            much the thoughtlessness of it that was so wretched as that any human
                            being, toiling to his full capacity, should not receive more of the
                            legitimate profits of his labor. These men, ignorant and, in a way,
                            valueless without direction, were nevertheless useful creatures and, in
                            this sense if no other, were deserving of a far more reasonable share of
                            the profit which their efforts created. That it should not be so, that
                            despite their willing or non-willing they should be driven early and
                            late to create a surplus which was not directly applied to the pressing
                            needs of society as a whole, but to the frittering amusements of the
                            few, not much better in the main than themselves, seemed hard.</p>
                        <p>And yet sometimes when I looked out upon the world as it glimmered before
                            my windowswhen I saw, as it so chanced, the waters of the river flowing
                            by, the splendid boats riding at anchor or steaming peacefully past, and
                            the wonder of the hills and hollows, all set suggestively before the
                            eyesit came to me that, perhaps, in spite of the seeming injustice
                            involved in this situation, variety was as essential to happiness as
                            socalled justice or equation, and that the very inequalities I was
                            bemoaning were the things which I was admiring in Nature. To blot out
                            the light and the shadows, to remove the hills and dales, to take away
                            the far reaches which spread between luxury and want, idleness and
                            toilmight not these be the things which after all would rob life of much
                            of its value and charm? Might they not?</p>
                        <p>But as I turned again to the weariness of my labor and saw once more the
                            routine, the comparative slavery, the drag of almost endless hours, I
                            could not help wishing for each that <pb id="VAA2441-107" n="98"/> there
                            might be some better solution than this necessity for varietythat
                            perhaps the heights and hollows need not after all be so vast. To survey
                            a mountain, to view a desertwas not this the privilege of but a few? And
                            might not the true beauty of life exist in the way-places where are
                            neither heights nor depths but only a tender and appealing undulation? I
                            wondered, and still do, for in spite of endless personal inconvenience I
                            have never been able to believe that an unbreakable dead level of
                            equality should maintain, that none should suffer overmuch, that none
                            should want to the extreme. And yet at this time, in this place, the
                            less varied seemed the all-to-be-desired. That it was not to be found in
                            so starkly diversified a world as here offers did not lessen the pain of
                            the labor or the value of the ideal in the least. To work, to wait, to
                            hope, to pray for some such changehow important these loomed in the hour
                            of weariness! And yet the charm that hope cast over effort was as though
                            the difference had already in part been bridged and that the realization
                            of the ideal was almost at hand.</p>

                    <div3 type="section">
                        <head>III.</head>
                        <p>The toil of the laborer is without mercy, its grim insistence unrequited
                            by anything save the meager wages wherewith it is paid. There is no true
                            beauty in it, no tenderness. There is no thought of anything save what
                            muscle and the strength of the individual can be made to yield. More
                            than this, the sum of what is accomplished passes almost entirely into
                            other hands. There is no provision made for those who will be as
                            tattered remnants when the things for which they labored have been
                            accomplished.</p>
                        <p>For several months I worked with the laborers for a great railroad. It
                            was the kind of labor that falls to the lot of every man who is
                            unskilled and whose sense of honesty or compulsion <pb id="VAA2441-108"
                                n="99"/> or duty or need commands that he labor. Those with whom I
                            worked were employed to carry lumber, load brick, shovel earth and mix
                            mortar. The work was requited at the rate of fifteen cents an hour, and
                            nothing more than this was allowed for overtime. We worked nine or ten
                            hours a day, as the light permitted. There was no rest for those here
                            employed save in a form of subterfuge, which was as wearisome as the
                            toil itself to one not accustomed to it by long years of practice. To be
                            sure one might delay in the carrying of anything; it was possible to be
                            deliberate, to hang first on one foot and then the other; there was a
                            way of resting on one&apos;s pick before lifting it; but the gain
                            was scarcely worth the pains. At the close of the day the sum of
                            idleness thus secured would not be sufficient to produce a restful
                            feeling, and the knowledge that a watchful foreman was well aware of the
                            spirit of your labor was not conducive to comfort.</p>
                        <p>We were under a foreman whose conception of life was that it meant toil,
                            and who himself was perfectly equipped physically to meet it. He did not
                            stop to parley or temper the necessities with tenderness but shouted and
                            cursed his commands, the fulfilling of which was as much of a burden on
                            his mind as upon our bodies. Work there was in plenty, vast quantities
                            of labor extending into the weeks and years, and the only thought which
                            the conclusion of one hard day&apos;s toil could bring was that
                            there was another exactly like it tomorrow. It had no end for the
                            individual save in arbitrary cessation on his part, the ending of his
                            pay, or in disintegration and death. And need drove so many to continue
                            day after day, without rhyme or reason in so far as the individual was
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>I could not help pondering over this from time to time, wondering at the
                            lust of the controlling powers at the top for money and place, the
                            fierceness of Nature in placing such an impulse in them, the fierceness
                            of the temper of our immediate masters (general managers,
                            superintendents, foremen and <pb id="VAA2441-109" n="100"/> the like),
                            the persistence of their frowns, the manner in which, when anything was
                            delayed or the work went wrong, they visited the blame upon the heads of
                            those beneath them, the urge and blame finally falling with sharp effect
                            upon the carriers and serfs at the bottom. Life did not seem to require
                            or justify it, I often thought. The rewards achieved by those at the
                            bottom at least were too inconsiderable. The enormous and almost useless
                            surplus of this great corporation flowering out into exotic social forms
                            at the top was proof that it was an unjust exaction. A man should be a
                            man in spite of the orders of his superiors. Mercy and tenderness should
                            qualify our every deed....So it looked from the bottom.</p>
                        <p>And then one day I was made a foreman.</p>
                        <p>I was determined that I, as foreman, would hold persistently, through
                            whatever wearinesses might come, to this earlier creed of courtesy and
                            consideration. I told myself that I would do better than these others.
                            There should be no harshness in my tone. I would not swear. A moderate
                            effort would be demanded of my men, but nothing more. So much for good
                            intentions.</p>
                        <p>In this new capacity I found that my duties were of a different nature
                            from those of my former, Here, instead of running at the beck and call
                            of another, I had men running for me, I had from a dozen to fifteen men
                            under me, as the work varied, and my principal duty was to see that they
                            did not shirk.</p>
                        <p>I accepted this with a light heart. It seemed easy enough, something
                            which could be accomplished in the most gracious spirit. All I had to do
                            was to take my position beside my gang, humming a tune, and to watch (as
                            I thought) their progress with a gentle and merry heart.</p>
                        <p>How speedy and how sad was my disillusionment!</p>
                        <p>Before one day was gone I was made to feel that the pressure which was on
                            me from above must be transferred <pb id="VAA2441-110" n="101"/> to
                            those who were below, regardless. There were orders to be complied with,
                            periods to be observed, standards of quality to be maintained in certain
                            kinds of work, which my men did not always understand. Nor did an
                            explanation or a simple request always result in understanding or ready
                            willingness to comply. They were often tired, a night&apos;s rest
                            not always apparently repairing the weariness of the day before. None
                            were so dull that they could not see that many reaped where they had not
                            sown, took joy in that for which they had never paid, while others like
                            themselves sweated under a load which they had never vailed to carry.
                            Dark looks, dark moods, dark wishes were as common as ever, yet if my
                            own position or my superior&apos;s good will were worth anything to
                            me I could not allow them to fall below their quota of toil. It was
                            necessary to achieve a given result, or resign, and at every turn there
                            were rules, rules, rules.</p>
                        <p>How hard I tried to adjust my new relationship to the ideal which had
                            previously been mine, and at the same time comply with the rules of the
                            company, I will not say. For a time I did manage to keep a cheerful
                            attitude and to speak gently. I tried to overlook the indifference and
                            subterfuge which I knew they were practicing and which before, in part
                            at least, had seemed justifiable but which must also in part be
                            overcome, if life were to go on at all. For Nature, as I had come to
                            see, had established these inequalities, the smallness of mind in some,
                            the strength and vision in others. Who was I to set about establishing
                            exact justice or equation, where I had not created? Or how or where? Or
                            I might smile and smile and urge with pleasant compliments, but how did
                            that justify or make amends? And although for a time it seemed as though
                            I might succeed in avoiding all difficulty, still the memory of my own
                            recent feelings was too fresh not to influence me deeply.</p>
                        <p>Then came a day when the pressure of work to be done was <pb
                                id="VAA2441-111" n="102"/> so much greater than it had been before
                            that the usual subterfuge of the men became an irritation to me. They
                            were painfully and exasperatingly slow, if not without reason, and the
                            pressure on me from above was heavy also. A heavy rain had washed the
                            earth into a long trench which we had been excavating. It was necessary
                            to hurry the reopening of this in order not to delay other work.
                            Concrete had to be prepared, a large foundation set by a given date. We
                            were under urgent surveillance from our superiors and could but follow
                            out their orders or resign.</p>
                        <p>In this situation I confess that I did not do much parleying with my
                            sense of equation or justice. Although I knew these men to be in the
                            main underpaid and overworked, and in so far as the corporation was
                            concerned mere machines to be pushed to the limit of their capacity and
                            discharged when no longer useful, still I stood beside them and ordered
                            and commanded, urging first one and then the other with shouts and gruff
                            words, until at last they were as wrought up and as harried by me as
                            they had been by any one of whom I had previously complained. They were
                            driven, harassed <hi rend="i">by me</hi>, until one, irritated by the
                            anachronism of it all, no doubt, my previous enthusiasm for better
                            conditions, turned on me with: &quot;Yeshurry! Hurry! You
                            didn&apos;t work so hard yourself, though!&quot;</p>
                        <p>I paused in my ordering and walked aside a little space to consider. How
                            true was the thing he said! I had not worked so. It had been a constant
                            complaint with me, in my own mind at least, that so much insistence and
                            heartless driving had never been justified by the reward offered, that
                            the men were entitled to more than they received for the grudging toil
                            they gave. And here was I outdoing these drivers who to me had seemed
                            most brutal!</p>
                        <p>For that day then, and for many others, I tried to discover just how it
                            was that I had drifted into so rough and exacting <pb id="VAA2441-112"
                                n="103"/> an attitude. Did I not know now, as well as before, that
                            the corporation for which we were all working was enormously rich? Had I
                            not more evidence than before that the men were overworked and
                            underpaid, my own demands proving it? Could I not see in the orders
                            given me that there was no consideration for them, but only the thing to
                            be accomplished at the least possible expense?</p>
                        <p>I acknowledged freely that this was absolutely true, and yet I now
                            pleaded with myself that I saw no way to remedy it and that if I did not
                            fulfill the company&apos;s orders some one else would. The work had
                            to be done. There was no way of permitting these men to shirk and take
                            their time, without noticeably delaying the work. If the corporation was
                            to be run, its present efficiency maintained and the public served, it
                            would of course have to be done at a profit which would induce men of
                            initiative and skill at the top to serve; otherwise no man would
                            undertake the matter, and there would be no labor at all for any of
                            these men at the bottom. For Nature apparently went on the theory of
                            great reward for those who could or would originate and conduct in a
                            large way, little for those who could not; and these at the bottom did
                            not and apparently could not originate. Their reasoning powers were not
                            as yet sufficiently developed for that. They were, by reason of their
                            mental equipment, hewers of wood and drawers of water.</p>
                        <p>After a time I felt that I could no longer go on without making a
                            definite choice: I must serve them or their masters wholeheartedly. The
                            retort of the laborer had proved too great a shock, and it was long
                            before I recovered my exterior equanimity, and never again my internal
                            peace, here. Plainly I was not one called by nature to this task. Reason
                            as I would, the two elements of capital and labor, exacting strength and
                            helpless weakness, would not adjust themselves within my consciousness
                            save in some such rough way as I here saw <pb id="VAA2441-113" n="104"/>
                            operating, and so because of my natural sympathy for these underlings I
                            was forced in spite of myself to choose sides. Either I must relinquish
                            my former attitude of sympathy for the men and opposition to the
                            indifference of the company, or I must side with them. There could be no
                            middle ground, and until I should choose my conscience would give me no
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>It was after a particularly hard day&apos;s work and because of some
                            special conditions that I managed finally to reach a decision, which,
                            however much it may have benefited me, helped them in no least way. We
                            had been mixing concrete and, a touch of my old cynical uncertainty
                            dominating me, I had been driving them all the day long, urging one to
                            shovel faster, calling to another to bring the wheelbarrows of stone
                            almost before they were needed, sending this one for water and that one
                            for cement, until the men were running about like ants. About four
                            o&apos;clock of this long day it began to rain. It had been gray and
                            lowery all day but now the moisture descended in a fine drizzle and we
                            were compelled to work or leave unfinished the batch of concrete we were
                            just beginning. In a sullen mood, because of my own dreary part in this,
                            I stood and held them to their task, not caring much what became of them
                            or myself either, until at last the work was completed. At dusk, damp
                            and dreary, I took my lunch-box and tramped doggedly along the tracks
                            toward the depot, comforted by one thought only: that the day was over
                            and I myself was free.</p>
                        <p>It was at that hour when the traffic outward from the great city assumes
                            its most imposing aspect. Along this magnificent highway of steel were
                            speeding the trains of one of the wealthiest corporations in the world.
                            Limiteds were passing, their splendid interiors aglow with half a
                            hundred lights. Seemingly more prosperous citizens than we were <pb
                                id="VAA2441-114" n="105"/> reclining there in comfort. Others were
                            gazing out idly. The dining cars of various trains were set with silver
                            and white linen.</p>
                        <p>As I paused near the station to turn my eye on this truly appealing scene
                            and to gather its significance as contrasted with that which I had just
                            left, there passed by, going in my direction, the little procession of
                            Italians over whom I ruled, bearing with them the tools with which they
                            had been laboring. There was Philip, whom I had often noted as I stood
                            beside the trench in which he was working, his body all twisted and bent
                            from long years of unremitting toil; there was Angelo, old and leathern
                            in feature, whose one boast was that he had never missed a
                            day&apos;s work in seventeen years; there was Matteo, thin, spare,
                            worn-looking, whose eye was alight with a kindly humor and whose
                            willingness to work I had never been able to question; there were John
                            and Collarbrace (as we called one Calabrian), Mussolin and Jimmie, all
                            trudging patiently onward like cattle, the day of their labor having
                            brought forth nothing but a night of weariness.</p>
                        <p>And as I stood there looking at them I could not help contrasting the
                            weariness of their labor with this (one of many, many), flowers which
                            it, or labor like it, had produced at the top. Here was this immerse
                            corporation with its magnificent equipment, its palatial depots, its
                            comfortable trains speeding onward bearing their burdens of the
                            comfortable (?) and the more fortunate (?), and here at the very bottom
                            were these humble trudgers making their away homeward in the night and
                            the rain. And as I thouht of the meagerness of their wages, the manner
                            in which I had driven them, and the profitless luxury, in so far as they
                            were concerned, to which their labor trended, I resolved that I, for
                            one, would have nothing more to do with it.</p>
                        <p>Not to drive where I could not ease, not to urge where I <pb
                                id="VAA2441-115" n="106"/> could not repay, not to be a tool in the
                            hands of their indifferent masters who could not or would not interest
                            themselves in them, was something, even though my ceasing could not
                            relieve them of their toil.</p>

                    <head>PERSONALITY</head>
                    <p>IN the last analysis personality appears to be a sense of power resting on a
                        feeling of capability or wisdom and usefulness, and hence a right to be; or
                        this may be reversed for some and it be said to be a sense of capability or
                        usefulness which springs from inherent wisdom and power. At best it is
                        inexplicable to the individual himself. He does not know from whence it
                        comes, why he has it, why he of all people should have it and so many other
                        billions not, why his thoughts should be large where those of others are so
                        small, his cunning or subtlety great where those of so many others are
                        obviously less. If he has in addition any charm of character, being thus
                        endowed, he will be courteous, considerate, merciful; but it by no means
                        follows that he must so have or be. That would not explain an Attila, an
                        Alaric, a Can Grande or a Torquemada.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why should I be born with a great mind,&quot; a Caesar, a
                        Shakespeare, a Hannibal or a Leonardo might well have asked of himself,
                        &quot;whereas so many have little ones? Why is my frail bark speeded by
                        winds of destiny or chance over favorable seas to power, where so many are
                        beached or foundered en route? Did I make myself? Did I foreknow
                        all?&quot; Where so profound an egoist, even with a minute brain, to
                        claim so much?</p>
                    <p>The truth is all good things are gifts, a voice, strength of body, vigor of
                        mind, vision, the power to lead, as in war, any art, beauty, charm. This is
                        not to say that these things may not be technically improved, and are, but
                        this is the business with which mediocrity is chiefly concerning itself. I
                        know <pb id="VAA2441-117" n="108"/> that the world, where it lacks the
                        strength to think on the subject, thinks differently, but this is mere
                        nonsense and without import.</p>
                    <p>The man of personality or destiny realizes the guidance, enmity or favor of
                        not necessarily higher, we will say, but different powers. (I am not for
                        saints, guardian <hi rend="i">angels</hi>, Buddhas, Christs, perfect gods
                        all.) He realizes all too keenly the element of chance, luck, unpropitious
                        as well as propitious hours. Sometimes, in spite of himself and to his
                        wonder, he notes that his affairs prosper. &quot;There is a
                        tide&quot; At other times (and who has not realized this?), try as he
                        will, he had better lay aside all effort and disappear. Fortune will have
                        none of him. The furies hover over his path. Harpies beset him. Go where he
                        will, there will be elements to annoy him, if no more than an ill wind to
                        blow his cap away or to cast dust into his eyes. He, above all others, knows
                        that time and chance happen to all men.</p>
                    <p>But it is so easy to cite the old-time virtues of honesty, stability,
                        truthfulness, fair-dealing, etc., as proving character, its value, and the
                        power of any one, however weak or defective, personally to achieve it. But
                        always, in spite of the advocates of simple and normal and moral things as
                        proving in themselves genius and worth, there is something more magnetism,
                        for instance, a thing not necessarily or solely a part of these other
                        so-called virtues, and strength, assurance, courage, generous or the
                        reverse. These are not things of ethical import necessarily, but they make
                        for success just the same. Observe that youth admires color, flare,
                        pugnacity, brute courage and daring; middle age, knowledge of sorts,
                        aggressiveness, endurance, success; old age, wisdom, generosity, humility,
                        etc. How many of the former are ethical? In the quiet halls of learning or
                        reflection certain of the tabulated virtues may be extolled, but to whom
                        does the world pay attention, to whom has it paid attention? Darius,
                        Artaxerxes, Alexander, <pb id="VAA2441-118" n="109"/> Caesar, Hannibal,
                        Attila, Alaric, Peter the Hermit, Napoleon, the Kaiser; possessing what of
                        all these virtues? Caesar kind, patient, honest, truthful? Napoleon the
                        same? Antony the same? Attila the same? Not even the popes, the preachers,
                        the founders of religion were so. Always craft, force, diplomacy; but little
                        of the sacrificial media so extolled and commended to the rank and file in
                        order to keep them at rest.</p>
                    <p>It is significant of the intellectual development of America, if not of other
                        countries, that we hear less these days of <hi rend="i">character</hi>, that
                        something or somewhat which we were all supposed to have, or at least
                        develop for ourselves or make (!) la Washington, Lincoln, Grant, etc., who
                        in most American schoolbook essays and college addresses were and still are
                        supposed to have <hi rend="i">made</hi> their skill, endurance,
                        resourcefulness, etc.; and more of that other thing which we call
                        personality and which for a long time apparently we were not supposed to
                        have, that unexplainable, inescapable something with which we come and in
                        which even here in America we are now beginning to believe. Yes, we are
                        beginning to suspect that there are certain things which some of us cannot
                        do, however much we may wish or try to. Also that ability in many realms and
                        forms comes without volition on our part, fate and circumstance causing it
                        to blaze for us whether we will or no. After many volumes of another kind of
                        mush, this is at last becoming rather apparent. There is less talk now of
                        being Napoleons all, adding inches to our stature by taking thought (lifting
                        ourselves by our boot-straps, in other words), and more of plain effort
                        according to our especially inherited abilities or capacities. It is a sad
                        truth for most men, more especially for most Americans, when they discover
                        it, but it is nevertheless an economic and helpful one. Men do better once
                        they realize their genuine limitations and cease reaching for the moon. For
                        so very long, here in America at least, we have been <pb id="VAA2441-119"
                            n="110"/> fed on something so very different: our inalienable ability to
                        do anything and everything equally well.</p>
                    <p>One wonders at times whether the light is really breaking. Can it be that we
                        are getting ready to admit that we are not Caesars each and all, held back
                        by our own idleness and indifference? One begins to rub one&apos;s eyes.
                        I have often wondered why it is that the word &quot;common,&quot; in
                        its sense of being plentiful and therefore indifferent, has not struck home
                        to the many of us for what it is: an expression of contempt; and that
                        &quot;uncommon,&quot; &quot;extraordinary,&quot; denote
                        approbation. Why, if this is not true, should everything that is common be
                        held so lightly of the mass, whereas that which is special or individual,
                        inherited or no, is of such intense interest to it? For example, the
                        individual skill or personal traits of the actor, painter, writer, sculptor,
                        the exceptionally talented in any field?</p>
                    <p>The truth is that the average man, dull as he is, realizes quite well that a
                        creature who has little or nothing that is different from millions of his
                        kind is of small import here or anywhere. There is no especial demand for
                        what he has to offer. If he wishes to stand out above his fellows he must
                        bring something new, and this he cannot provide by mere wishing or thinking.
                        There is something more than thatinherent capacity, a something which he
                        cannot create for himself, try as he may. He also knows that Nature sends
                        bubbling up from her inexhaustible springs an infinitude of creatures who
                        are of small import, because they have no inherent power wherewith to
                        develop very special characteristics, or better yet individual impulsesin
                        other words, personality. They cannot, and are not asked to, create them
                        after they arrive here. They must have them to begin with, or they are not
                        important, cannot make their way easily. And again, it is obviously quite
                        right that a creature with qualities except those of the species should have
                        to confine its claim to <pb id="VAA2441-120" n="111"/> an existence entirely
                        within the limits of the species, and live a life conditioned by them. If
                        Nature wishes one to rise above the conditions wherewith he finds himself
                        surrounded at birth She usually provides him with the equipment for so doing
                        during gestation, or before, and in addition accidental and most opportune
                        circumstances invariably aid him. He is the heir of most propitious
                        conditions. Vide Caesar, Napoleon, Shakespeare, Luther, Lincoln, even
                        Goethe. Yet, it is impossible, I presume, to convince the mass that this is
                        true. It would be too discouraging.</p>
                    <p>Again, it is a common fallacy among the ignorant that no lower animal
                        possesses more than the generic characteristics of its speciessuch-and-such
                        powers, such-and-such limitations, such-and-such instincts,although this of
                        course is not true. There are weak and strong animals of the same species,
                        more cunning and less, more ferocious and less, better-natured and less,
                        just as there are among men. (If you do not believe this study cats and
                        dogs, the historic wolf of Cevennes in France.) Indeed in many intellectual
                        circles, so-called, it is still claimed for man that he is the only one to
                        possess individual character. But this is not true, as the &quot;Origin
                        of Species&quot; plainly shows. Sometimes I think that man, take him by
                        and large, presents less differences than some of the individuals of species
                        of the so-called lower animals. He is supposed to reason more, but does he?
                        It seems to me that the average cat reasons quite as well as the average
                        plumber or grocer, if not better. Give a good pagan tomcat a man&apos;s
                        body and sensory capacity, and how long do you suppose he would remain a
                        plumber? The truth is that man, somewhat confused at present in his response
                        to those chemic instincts which appear originally to have guided him, has
                        been all but done for mentally by vain isms and theories. At times these
                        same appear to be able, and quite completely, to do for him mentally, as
                        does cancer and tuberculosis for him physicallyvide Christianity,
                        Mohammedanism, <pb id="VAA2441-121" n="112"/> Shintoism, etc. On the other
                        hand, the animal has no such handicap, let us say, as Catholicism,
                        Shintoism, or what Mohammed or Buddha or Zoroaster said. It has just life
                        and its own bare wits or chemical responses wherewith to do, no restraining
                        and deadening rules. Hence it has very marked personality at times, and
                        makes its way exceedingly well and without restraint or deadening aid of
                        community or mass governmental advice. This is true of snakes, birds,
                        fishes, monkeys and all other creatures <hi rend="i">lower</hi>, so-called,
                        than man.</p>
                    <p>In most men, individual character, that thing which is supposedly so superior
                        to lower animals, comes to very little. They run in schools, join secret
                        orders or churches, vegetate, label themselves in a dull way democrats,
                        republicans, socialists, and strive in all ways to make themselves as like
                        others (those within their immediate ken) as possible. My father, for
                        instance (peace to his spirit!), wished to prepare himself by
                        self-abnegation, prayers and good works here on earth to fit himself for an
                        entirely mythical heaven, to be a standardized angelwings, harp, robes and
                        allsuch as he saw in the &quot;saint pictures&quot; in the various
                        Catholic churches which he attended from time to time. These were the only
                        representations of the future life with which he was familiar, hence he
                        accepted them as true! Indeed as a rule the average or ordinary man
                        (fortunately there is no exact average) cannot think or see beyond his quite
                        immediate environment and binding rules, his neighborhood, his church, what
                        somebody else says or thinks.</p>
                    <p>A plumber wants to be exactly like the next successful plumber he sees; a
                        grocer, the same; an undertaker, the same. Most rich men would like to live
                        in a house like that of all the other rich men they know. Show them the very
                        different house of a rich man in Spain, in Egypt, in India, in Japanit would
                        never, never do. It is not like that which they know. Their thoughts and
                        desires, like their faces, are <pb id="VAA2441-122" n="113"/> those of the
                        species to which they belong. In the main, they are of a trivial,
                        commonplace character, as unimportant as a bean or a pea. Like animals of so
                        limited a mentality as the duck and the penguin, if you know one you know
                        all. You might almost say that they have come to their end spiritually.
                        Nothing can be done for them. Some more vigorous active thingi. e., the
                        thinking, restless, dissatisfied individualmust come along to rebel and push
                        them aside. If ever the surface of the commonplace is to be disturbed the
                        individual moved by some inherited or bestowed impulse must do it: Luther,
                        Galileo, Keppler, Newton, Columbus.</p>
                    <p>Anything that is strong, special, different must, as a matter of course and
                        by its very nature, stand alone in the world where so many things are not
                        strong, special, different. That which places one being over another and
                        sets differences between man and man is not alone intellect or knowledge, as
                        some would have us believe (Schopenhauer, for one), but these plus, other
                        things being equal, the vital energy to apply them or the hypnotic power of
                        attracting attention to themin other words, personality. It is that peculiar
                        quality or ability which makes a way for our plans, desires, dreams.
                        Cunning, which is by no means knowledge in the sense in which we use that
                        word, nor intellect of a high order perhaps (although it may well be), still
                        may play a magnificent share in personality and contribute to its triumph.
                        No truer book than Machiavelli&apos;s &quot;The Prince,&quot;
                        although it earned him the distinction of equaling the devil, was ever
                        written, although the necessary gift of hypnotic personality was by no means
                        sufficiently insisted upon. Was not one of the amazing qualities of Julius
                        Caesar, as of Hannibal, Napoleon and, indeed, most of the outstanding
                        figures of history, cunning? The average man, realizing his own limitations,
                        does not like to believe it, but it is none the less true. Did Alexander the
                        Great, for instance, lack it? Or Lincoln? On the other hand, mere strength
                        without cunning <pb id="VAA2441-123" n="114"/> is so little. Contrast the
                        tiger and the Norman horse or an elephant. Which of the three is truly
                        superior? Which one commands your innate respect?</p>
                    <p>Whatever else you do, believe nothing in regard to the individual&apos;s
                        ability to develop an especial and remarkable capacity, unless it is already
                        inherent in him at birth. Nature works in no other way. Another thing, life
                        cannot do without brains, however much disassociated from beatific virtues
                        these may be; for these are a gift and can no more be created here than you
                        can add to your height by taking thought. What life does is to develop and
                        train especial inherent capacitiesan eye, a hand, a taste, a smell perhaps;
                        but the instinct and the ability to foreknow, to appreciate, understandthese
                        things are not taught in schools. Schools labor with them to improve,
                        polish, give them a special turn or bent; little more and little less.</p>

                    <head>A COUNSEL TO PERFECTION</head>
                    <p>BRIEF as are the sensations of success, victory, happiness, etc., yet these
                        are things of actually some duration and as such can be looked forward to
                        and back upon with pleasure, which in itself is a kind of reward for living.
                        Love is real, a kinetic vibration of great comfort and a reward, as well as
                        are the gratifications which arise from a sense of wealth or power or any
                        hunger satiated. All these may be exceedingly brief and do fade, but however
                        brief and however quickly faded they endure for at least a minute fraction
                        of time and are therefore, and legitimately so, the basis of much human
                        hope, ambition, delight, as well as despair and all the other contraries
                        which might otherwise be inexplicable. The pathetic thing in connection with
                        them all is that they are so plainly baits as well as rewards, that they do
                        prove man to be the victim or evoluted mechanism if not tool of some higher,
                        perhaps scheming force by no means essentially friendly to, if it is even
                        conscious of, him, and that an enduring state of pleasure for anything is
                        not contemplated by Nature as an essential portion of the career of man;
                        also that it may be by no means concerned as to whether or no man, its tool,
                        achieves any moments of triumph or satiation.</p>
                    <p>Looking at most livesthe defeated, the hungry, the poorly equipped mentally
                        and physically, the homely, those seized on in childhood by the strong and
                        shrewd and made to serve pointless and wretched purposes entirely alien to
                        their livesI should say that Nature does not care and that distinctly for
                        them life may not be worth its pains. On the other hand, <pb
                            id="VAA2441-125" n="116"/> where crass chance lifts a given organism to
                        great power or builds it with such care that it is an almost perfect and
                        delicately responsive machine, life may well be and no doubt is worth all
                        its costs. Many organisms, by accident of dullness or non-responsiveness of
                        a higher sort, come off with less pain, and Nature, either accidentally or
                        intentionally, builds most of these. They are machines well suited to the
                        rough grind of material and psychic forces, and may be said to strike such a
                        neat equation with the circumstances of life that they achieve a kind of
                        sensory comfort or satiation and so do well enough. Again, dulling religion
                        or illusions of one type and another, fatuitous hopes far beyond the pale of
                        possibility, sensory response of a comfortable character to this earthly
                        scene as a spectacle, or depleted nervous energy or force which reduces many
                        to the point where nervous or sensory response is lacking, eases many to the
                        place where it may be said that if they do not enjoy keenly they at least do
                        not suffer keenly.</p>
                    <p>But is man happy? Is his game worth the candle? The sophisticated reply that
                        the fear of death proves that life is worth while, since all are so eager to
                        avoid it. But this is worse than no answer for it predicates either no life
                        at all, which is certainly no recommendation, or that there may be worse
                        things <hi rend="i">there</hi> than those which befall man <hi rend="i"
                            >here</hi>certainly no proof of a keen joy in this.</p>
                    <p>The essential tragedy of life, then, and the thing which makes it painful to
                        consider, is this: that once man is raised above the non-cerebrating and
                        automatic sensory responsiveness of the beast he becomes conscious of the
                        rather obvious fact that he is either an intelligently or an accidentally
                        evoluted mechanism or minute tool in the hands of something so much more
                        significant than himself that he is as nothing; and again, that to this
                        force or intelligence above him his little earthly schemes bear about as
                        much relationship as do those of an office boy bent on becoming a baseball
                        pitcher to those of the <pb id="VAA2441-126" n="117"/> Standard Oil Company
                        or the German Emperor bent on world dominion. And againand this is the
                        darkest thought of allit, our personal Creator, assumed by the religionists
                        at least to be so careful of our individual welfare, may be little more than
                        the veriest tyro in so far as the larger and largest creative forces or
                        impulses in the universe are concerned. Manifesting little or no interest in
                        us, no more perhaps than is needful to its own welfare, it may be as little
                        to the powers above it as are we to it. For who can guess whether the thing
                        or power which makes man is the ultimate power or guiding force in so
                        spacious a thing as the universe? Already our chemists and physicists are
                        inclined to doubt it. Its impulses, humors, appetites and methods, as
                        manifest in man, are by no means of so glorious or illuminating a character
                        as to inspire admiration, even in its machine: man. Plainly its methods and
                        actions bespeak as much of the lowest as of the highest that we know, and
                        this is as much evidenced by the thoughts, aspirations, tastes or habits,
                        chemically compulsory or no, of man, its product, and through whom it
                        seemingly expresses itself, as by its methods and procedure in other ways,
                        fumbling efforts and failures of all kinds. For man in his capacity as
                        chemist, physicist, fumbling philosopher, didactic or synchronetic poet,
                        experimentator or agnostic is scarcely a fit creature for one to contemplate
                        as the highest product of a so-called supreme intelligence or God, or Good,
                        however well he might look as the product of a minor and so seeking hieratic
                        power. For if God, or Good, as so many have already pointed out, can do no
                        better than produce the quarreling, cating, seeking, spewing thing we know
                        as manand that is the chief concern of His intelligence!!!</p>
                    <p>We will assume that you have read at least a simple work on astronomy or
                        chemistry or physics. If so, could you possibly believe that the present
                        intelligence of man, or even any conceivable progress which he can make in
                        his present limited <pb id="VAA2441-127" n="118"/> form and with his present
                        equipment of senses, would be of sufficient force to gather either the
                        meaning or sensory impact of spaces, distances, weights, relationships which
                        at present, except in the most minute and fragmentary way, are entirely
                        beyond him? Consider the meaninglessness of numbers to you, of great
                        weights, distances. I for one would be the last to cast a shadow upon
                        man&apos;s dreams or pride, but when one investigates even the little we
                        are permitted to knowthe darkness, the inexplicable confusion, the
                        non-reason in all the things we think, believe, hope forit would, at the
                        least, suggest that aeons must elapse and man himself change radically and
                        develop powers (which, if they are his at all at present, are in embryo)
                        before he could begin to conceive of the significance of even the smallest
                        of the forces which he seems to use but which in reality use him.</p>
                    <p>All the great things, the creative impulses and substances such as produce
                        even the most minute forms of life which at present we can see, are entirely
                        outside the range of his limited group of senses. He does not know, for
                        instance, where heat or cold begin or end; what shades lie beyond the outer
                        edges of the spectrum; what are the limits or the immediate beyond of sound,
                        light, weight, space, etc. His weak senses plus his devised instrumental
                        aids offer him no real help. They merely multiply his difficulties.
                        Something has invented an eye, an ear, an olfactory nerve, the ganglia of
                        the fingertips, the central cerebral cortex and so-called reason, all of
                        which appear to be nothing more than assembled and synchronized reactions to
                        other and unknown stimuli, wherewith it is possible now for man to apprehend
                        only minute portions of the immense energies and substances blowing about
                        him. Yet with all these aids and the evidences of the mechanism of the
                        universe outside him which they yield, still man, attacking special bits and
                        portions, finds it quite impossible to suggest the reason for anything. He
                        lacks the equipment and power, <pb id="VAA2441-128" n="119"/> which even the
                        thing which made him may not have, of creating such finer perceptive organs
                        as might aid him. At present and at best apparently he is allowed only to
                        invent some thingssuch, for instance, as are or may be useful to the
                        propagation and rearing of man in the matter of numbers, not brains. His
                        Creator apparently is either unable or unwilling to endow him with such
                        equipment as might make for great knowledge. Tremendous psychic
                        opportunities appear and go by, as when a duller and more ignorant Rome
                        conquers a sensitive and highly perceptive and meditative Greece. Owing to
                        his minor equipment, ignorance and vain beliefs flourish, and he stumbles
                        from one vain illusion and delusion to anotherto achieve what? Something,
                        possibly, which his Creator can use. Or so it would seem.</p>
                    <p>But it is not this phase alone which is troublesome. One might and does get
                        along well enough knowing but a minute portion of that which, it would seem,
                        our immediate Creator must plainly know concerning the processes by which we
                        arrive, depart and function during our little stay here, but to a seeking
                        intelligence there is inescapable tragedy in the plain implication, written
                        large over everything, that to the accidental Creator of man the largest
                        intelligence of whatsoever bent or character among him is of no more
                        importance to the ruling force than the veriest gnat or leaf. It, whatever
                        it is that makes man and the animal, manufactures intelligences as though
                        they were buttons or pins, and though it create from time to time an
                        Anaximander, a Plato, an Alexander, a Socrates, a Keppler, a Newton, a
                        Leonardo or any other titanic brain, yet to it the least ditch-digger or
                        wastrel is as important. The mass is everything, the individual nothing.
                        With the greatest nonchalance or blundering inconsequence it strikes down a
                        Hertz, a Raphael, a Curie, a Spinoza, a Schubert, a Keats. Seventy years is
                        the allotted span for all, great or small, an average amount of strength,
                        the same stomach and <pb id="VAA2441-129" n="120"/> blood capacity. Though
                        an individual had seemingly the most important ideas under consideration,
                        great schemes wherewith to benefit or further the so-called progress of man
                        (the especial care, as we learn, of his Maker), still this is of no least
                        importance to his Creator. It is invariably on, on, out of the way, as
                        though the Creator had most carefully arranged not to take advice from any
                        one He made, or as though a blind process were at work which could not. If
                        the former, one might say small blame to one so powerful. Presuming Him even
                        moderately intelligent, how unimportant His little mannikins must be to the
                        ultimate scheme of things, the giant forces through which He manifests
                        Himself and which grind, helplessly create, helplessly control! Imagine
                        taking advice from a loaf of bread you had accidentally evolved, or
                        listening to the protests or advice of a ginger-snap of your own
                        creating!</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless if it were possible in the face of the driving forces which seem
                        wholly to manipulate him to reach man and by a suggestion aid him, it would
                        be that in the face of so much confusion he no longer wastes time on
                        theories wholly unrelated to himself or his own material welfare, his
                        essential necessities here, but rather that he see to it first of all, and
                        clearly, that his life here is something which is to be lived here and now
                        to the utmost, in the best form for allduring seventy years, if not
                        longerhere, and not elsewhere, and that some reasonable and concentrated
                        effort be made to make it livable for man here and now instead of elsewhere,
                        however glittering or picturesque that elsewhere may be, thin romance that
                        it is. For is it not high time that we all realized how essential it is to
                        make life worth while for all here, knowing as we now do that man is not a
                        pet in Nature and that if he makes anything of himself and his social as
                        well as his mental state here it must be with the full understanding that he
                        can expect but little if any aid from Nature or the forces directing him,
                            <pb id="VAA2441-130" n="121"/> certainly none that would tend to
                        ultimately enlarge his own mental clarity and supremacy. To this end
                        therefore it would seem advisable that man as a whole throw over as swiftly
                        as possible all his old-time religious and moral conceptions, his
                        restraining conventions, taboos and the like, and re-examine for himself the
                        data concerning which, accidentally or otherwise, he now finds himself
                        capable of cerebrating and according to which he is now supposed to regulate
                        his life. It may not be true that he should limit himself as his present
                        theories and ethics suggest. And furthermore, his greatest problem being
                        that of living longer, of being stronger, happier, not so much the butt and
                        jest of chance or the willful or indifferent moods of the surrounding and
                        stronger forces in Nature, that he devote himself entirely to solving those
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>Elsewhere I have indicated a possibly broader moral conception which may be
                        of value to this end. One of the greatest achievements, of course, would be
                        to rid the human mind of all vain illusion concerning things spiritual, to
                        get it to see, if it were possible, that man is not necessarily an enduring
                        spiritual creature endowedfor who can know?with an enduring and progressive
                        soul, but rather that he is an implement or tool in the hands of something
                        else which is creating or using him as, for example, the vine does the leaf,
                        yet which itself may be of no great import in Nature.</p>
                    <p>If, by any process of investigation, and as now seems possible, it could be
                        proved that man&apos;s Creator is no universal lord by any means but a
                        blind fumbling force, it should be possible for man to do one of two things:
                        either ally himself strictly with such impulses and instincts as he can
                        detect as coming from this lesser and plainly more immediate Creatormany of
                        them plainly non-moral enough, as we may see by like impulses in him, and so
                        aid this Creator to discover Himself; or, now that he has a foothold here
                        and appears to be a fairly self-perpetuating machine, to endeavor to reveal
                            <pb id="VAA2441-131" n="122"/> to himself and for himself the secret of
                        self-creation and perpetuation and so become the equal of the force or
                        forces now using him. But to that end he would need to rid himself of the
                        delusion that anything in life should be accepted in blind faith and without
                        question as permanent. One of the oldest of the Hebraic sayings is
                        &quot;My son, get wisdom, get understanding,&quot; and a later saw
                        declares &quot;Knowledge is power,&quot; and so it is. Adam, in the
                        fable of the genesis of man, was condemned not so much for eating of the
                        Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge as for the fact that &quot;in the day ye
                        eat thereof your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
                        and evil.&quot; And Prometheus (forethought), the other
                        &quot;God&quot; who is supposed to have created man out of earth and
                        water and who for man&apos;s benefit &quot;stole fire from heaven in
                        a hollow tube&quot; and taught him all the useful arts, was punished for
                        this by Zeus, the supreme &quot;God,&quot; by being chained to a
                        rock and having his liver daily torn by an eaglecertainly a most significant
                        fable, for he was trying to make something of man, or rather teaching man to
                        help himself, and this the Supreme Ruler of the Universe did not want,
                        probably for the same reason that the Hebraic &quot;God&quot; wanted
                        Adam to remain a dull machine or clod.</p>
                    <p>But the Greek fable is far more hopeful and significant than is the Hebraic
                        one, for, in the former, strength (Hercules) subsequently slew the eagle and
                        released Prometheus, or forethought, thus allowing him to aid man; while in
                        Genesis man is condemned, slave-like and forever after, to &quot;eat his
                        bread in the sweat of his face,&quot; a very sharp commentary on the
                        nature of his Maker as the ancients conceived him. What is implied by both
                        fables is that man is a waif or accident in Nature, not intentionally
                        endowed with wisdom or the power to get it, and that Nature (Zeus, Jehovah,
                        anything you will) markedly objects to his obtaining any &quot;lest he
                        become as one <pb id="VAA2441-132" n="123"/> of us&quot; and
                        &quot;put forth his hand and take also of the Tree of Life and eat and
                        live forever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In view of this one might ask, Is life worth living? Is there any use?
                        Perhaps there would be if man, accidentally evoluted or not, but coming at
                        last, by accident or not, to the place where he finds himself able to reason
                        upon the processes which have brought him thus far, could seize upon the
                        constructive processes and so begin a creative, constructive career of his
                        own which would redound to his own benefit and comfort and none other. Only
                        there is no least evidence as to that yet, i. e., that it is possible. In so
                        far as one may judge by chemistry and physics man appears to be in the grip
                        of a blind force or process which cannot help itself and from which man can
                        derive no power to help himself save by accident or peradventure. Even now,
                        for all one can know, he may be sinking into a blind, unreasoning mush
                        instead of evoluting further, so many are the theories which counsel him to
                        believe in some vague, aimless peace hereafter and which he so readily
                        accepts. The important thing for him to do, supposing that he could, would
                        be to avoid henceforth all destroying notions of this character and to think
                        of himself rather as a waif, an unloved orphan in space, who must
                        nevertheless and by his own effort make his own pathetic way in the world.
                        Or, if that is too harsh, then to think of himself as part and parcel (leaf
                        and vine) of some hard-pressed Creator, a sun, a group of chemic forces
                        synthetized into an individual somewhat like himself, not a Supreme God, by
                        any means, but a kind of local manufacturer or well-meaning Prometheus who
                        is trying to make something out of man and Himself at the same time, being
                        in or of man, or man in Him (&quot;I am in the Father; the Father is in
                        me&quot;), but who in turn and so through him, man, is being assailed by
                        larger or rival forces and cannot always make His way as well as He might
                        wish. Hence, He needs the consideration and even help of man, the atomic
                        force of which <pb id="VAA2441-133" n="124"/> He is composed. That being the
                        case, the burden of life might possibly come to seem less hard.</p>
                    <p>But, aside from such an hypothesis, thought offers but small comfort to the
                        thinker viewing the drift of fact as one must. For see how painfully and
                        often most sadly our scientists and philosophers dig at this riddle of
                        existence and how slowly, if at all, we are really fitting ourselves for the
                        giant task, these greater and greater contests with Nature, which must come
                        if man is to come to anything. Even individual self-preservation via
                        chemistry, physics, mathematics, economics, sociology, philosophy,
                        astronomy, botany, biology, and what not, is a slow and difficult process.
                        On every hand are destructive forces that beset us, and we have apparently
                        only ourselves to look to that we be not so persistently tortured. All
                        religions and theories of Divine aid to the contrary, man has been and is
                        now compelled to battle hourly and momentarily for his
                        &quot;right&quot; (how pale is that word!) to live and grow, let
                        alone thinkagainst heat, cold, destructive rivals and enemies of all kinds,
                        destructive insects, savage animals, savage men, droughts, storms,
                        dissensions, diseases, deathwhereas he in turn has sought and does now seek
                        to help himself via farmers, butchers, inventors, scientists, doctors,
                        seeking to wrest from forces apparently alien to the one which prospers him,
                        if there is such an one, some of the powers which apparently they hold in
                        such vast abundance and which might even contain the secret of eternal life.
                        Who knows? Indeed, surveying what has befallen him throughout the ages, I
                        should suggest to man that he accept as true the fabled statement made by
                        &quot;God&quot; in Genesis iii. 14:19, and seek persistently and
                        without too much reverence for some method of solving his own difficulties.
                        He should reject vain theory, especially that which relates to a mythical
                        reward hereafter, and cling only to those methods and forms of procedure
                        which give promise or hope of a larger reward here, tending to strengthen
                        his capacity for living here and <pb id="VAA2441-134" n="125"/> now. Such a
                        theory or belief, however antagonistic to current religious theories, would
                        at least tend to make man less depressed and indifferent to his state here
                        and more conscious of the fact that if he is to extract any joy out of his
                        span he must think and plan to make things better not only for himself but
                        for others, since joy for himself depends upon his joy in others and they in
                        him. Indeed, it would give him more zest for the game here if he did. By
                        that last I am not arguing with the moralists for all their shabby, little
                        pinchbeck repressions, the idea that the less you do and know the better you
                        are; but rather that the more you do and know the better off you are,
                        physically and mentally, and the more you make your state or form of
                        government do and let you know the better.</p>
                    <p>How soon would not such an attitudenot on the part of all, for one cannot
                        hope for that, but of even a moderate minoritymake for a more vivid,
                        aggressive, fascinating world! How soon might not the now seemingly sealed
                        doors open, unsolvable (so-called) riddles end as solved, man acquire new
                        reasoning faculties, senses and powers, and finally stand forth a creative
                        force himself, a genuine creator on his own account, able not only to fend
                        and forefend against many of his present disasters here but to give new
                        powers and thought, and even creative force, to things which now crawl
                        meekly at the feet of man? Who knows? Is not courage better than fear? a
                        healthy, if skeptical, seeking better than blind, dull acceptance of
                        anything or nothing, as the case may be? I, for one, think so, and, for my
                        part, would prefer to be a seeking Prometheus chained to a rock and my liver
                        gnawed daily by the eagle of an irritated and jealous higher power than a
                        crawling worm or whimpering slave praying for some endless Nirvana, or a
                        minute part in an endless legion of cherubim harping the glory of something
                        which had plainly sought neither my peace nor my signficance but only my
                        painful, unimportant and even worthless service.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="sc">I SOMETIMES</hi> think that a calm and exhaustive study of the
                        American temperament in relation to sex and its various manifestations would
                        result in the scientific conclusion that this country, taken as a whole, is
                        as much a victim of a deepseated neurosis relating to this impulse as any,
                        the most morbid of those who appeal to psycho-analysis for treatment. The
                        profound and even convulsive interest in any case involving a sex crime or
                        delusion (Thaw, Leo Frank, Billy Brown, Carlisle Harris, Nan Patterson,
                        Durant; or any negro rape case in the South); the ridiculous and quite
                        neurotic interest displayed by grown men and women, to say nothing of
                        children, in the exploits of so-called &quot;cuties&quot;the
                        &quot;Spring Blossoms,&quot; &quot;June Elfs,&quot;
                        &quot;Violet Dawns&quot; of the moviesthe perennial and
                        astonishingly profitable (in so far as a certain class of theatrical
                        management is concerned) interest of the male and even female American in
                        the utterly mechanical and standardized beauty chorus shows with their
                        (presumably) seventeen-year-old maids in bathing, bedroom-bath and other
                        forms of abbreviated attire! Are not these points in evidence? In the matter
                        of the latter, no story is necessary; just erotic color, music, dancing
                        evolutions and double-meant (I almost said &quot;mint&quot;) jokes,
                        and the thing is done.</p>
                    <p>Again, look at any American city where morality or religion, or both,
                        presumably have full sway (and in what American city are they not supposed
                        to be dominant?), and what do you find? The most desirable locations in the
                        best portions of the city, outside of the trade centers, given over to the
                        leading churches and the newspapers, which preach a lofty <pb
                            id="VAA2441-136" n="127"/> code of ethics and morals which they
                        themselves find difficult if not impossible to practice; while elsewhere the
                        local bookstores and picture shops and bill-boards are crowded with a class
                        of literature and illustration, or so-called &quot;art,&quot; which
                        to read or view, according to the adjacent churches and newspapers, would
                        result in the loss of your immortal soul as well as your local standing. And
                        yet these same are displayed, sold and read plentifully and with avidity,
                        for the very good reason, no doubt, that they satisfy a craving and a thirst
                        not otherwise open to satiation. In any town of any size, what pictures are
                        not displayed and sold: &quot;September Morn,&quot;
                        &quot;Youth,&quot; &quot;Purity,&quot;
                        &quot;Innocence,&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot;
                        &quot;Waiting,&quot; and the like, disguised as little as the law
                        will permit. Again, where will you not find a swarm of sex magazines labeled
                        &quot;breezy,&quot; &quot;snappy&quot; and the like, the
                        kind that any sex-suppressed neurotic might well crave, and all received
                        with the profoundest gratitude and widest distribution? Where in America,
                        any more than abroad (barring countries of Asia, Africa and the South
                        Pacific, where sex-suppression is not the order of the day) does one lack
                        for pornographic nudes or privately circulated writings of the most lurid
                        character? Are the art or book or drug stores of the small towns free of
                        them? Is it not true that you can still buy almost everywhere,
                        &quot;Three Weeks,&quot; &quot;Life&apos;s Shop
                        Window,&quot; &quot;The Yoke,&quot; and other such classics,

                        by the intelligensia and the sex-satisfied only, and with an upward

                    <p>Not so very long since, I stopped for a little while in a town of a hundred
                        thousand population in the South. It was moral, religious, conventionalin
                        other words, American. It might as well, however, have been in New England,
                        the North-west, the Southwest, the Middle West, for any difference to be
                        discovered in its moral texture. In this home of chivalry, courtesy, purity
                        and the like, erected originally on the backs of driven slaves, a number of
                        its most interesting points of vantage were as usual occupied by the
                        churches, as impressive and prosperous as those anywhere. It had only one
                        theater of consequence, and that open only two nights a week, if so often.
                        Its poorer classes were entertained by three or four moving-picture
                        establishments (&quot;Passed by the National Board of
                        Censors&quot;); but the well-to-do also attended these, for they had no
                        other place to go for amusement. Yet, in the face of the highly censored
                        &quot;movies,&quot; theater and bookstores and the absence of houses
                        of ill-repute (all suppressed), there were two or three
                        &quot;first-class&quot; hotels, all with their Ths Dansantes,
                        cabaret suppers and the like, of the character of which I propose to speak
                        later. The most exclusive bookstore was so very moral that it would not
                        carry any books not approved by the &quot;Watch and Ward&quot; and
                        &quot;Library Protection&quot; association, nor would the
                        vine-covered library in the best section, although at any time you might
                        have gone to the principal dry-goods store and by a roundabout process
                        secured nearly all that you desired.</p>
                    <p>While I was in this city a twelve-year-old boy was arrested at one of the
                        railroad stations about two hundred yards from the principal beach for
                        appearing in a two-piece bathing suit. It was not asserted in the
                        prosecution which followed (which was vigorously defended by his father)
                        that a twelve-year-old boy in a two-piece bathing suit was immoral, but a
                        man in a <pb id="VAA2441-138" n="129"/> one-piece one or a girl in any kind
                        at all would be, and to avoid the possible vitiation of public purity which
                        might thus follow the boy was arrested. He was discharged with a warningbut
                        even so. You can see how high the virtue at this city should be.</p>
                    <p>Yet, at the same time, in this same city, were the three aforementioned
                        hotels with their Ths Dansantes, roof gardens, cabaret grills, this, that
                        and the other, and in these might have been seen, any late afternoon or
                        evening, winter and summer, such a collection of sex-struck infants and
                        elders as would be worth the same price of admission anywhere. The clothes!
                        The wondrous shoes and gaudy purses, the subdued and yet moving and
                        suggestive combination of colors! The efforts to flagellate the already too
                        harried imagination with a promise of delights which the local morality
                        squad, I fear, would never permit to be realized. You could pay as much in
                        either of these places for a pot of tea and three little thin slices of
                        toast as you could anywhere in the world. In their efforts to provide you
                        with a superior (sex) atmosphere they made it possible for you so to do.</p>
                    <p>Wrong? Not a bit. I am not describing it for that purpose; nor am I
                        quarreling with human nature for expressing its inmost desires, being what
                        it is: avid, alluring, secret, hungry. I am smiling at the anachronistic
                        spirit of the same community which would arrest the boy in the bathing suit,
                        prohibit &quot;near beer,&quot; snip every even weakly suggestive
                        passage out of a &quot;movie,&quot; &quot;run&quot; any
                        indecent play (&quot;Hedda Gabler,&quot; let us say, or
                        &quot;The Wild Duck,&quot; since it could not understand them) out
                        of town. No copies of &quot;The Song of Songs,&quot;
                        Rousseau&apos;s &quot;Confessions,&quot; &quot;The
                        Decameron,&quot; or the unexpurgated &quot;Arabian Nights.&quot;
                        Never, never, never! Yet look at these same hotels, these girls and youths
                        clinging to each other in the suggestive dances! The movements, the sinuous,
                        almost savage, abandon, the love-looks, the whispers! And the automobiles
                            <pb id="VAA2441-139" n="130"/> lined up along distant country roadsides
                        in the dark lateralthough not a single house of assignation or prostitution
                        was tolerated within the city limits. One had to secure a Ford and employ
                        the open woods and fields instead. And in the basement next to the
                        barbershop in each hotel was one or more &quot;manicure
                        booths,&quot; curtained confessionals or recessionals, into which one
                        might retire with a manicure maid to have one&apos;s fingers done. Owing
                        to the dashing quality of these maids the business was large.</p>
                    <p>For myself, I do not know what the psychic or spiritual or creative
                        significance of these impulses of the sexes may be, unless, in truth, within
                        equational limits they are moral or at least essential, and so to be
                        cherished as a good instead of an evil; but one thing is certain: their
                        appearance in this florid public form and in the center of a vice-cured city
                        would indicate that either the attitude of the nation is wrong or that we
                        have in our midst a host of neurotic or sex-struck degenerates who ought to
                        be eliminated from the body civic in a very radical manner. But are they
                        neurotic? Or is it the nation that is wrong, and these but the neurotic
                        symptoms of its error? Certainly, nowhere outside of America and especially
                        in such a vice-taboo realm as this, I fancy, are the terrors of sex excess,
                        the degradation and disease following sex libertinage, more enthusiastically
                        or more glowingly pointed out as the psychic or spiritual aftermath or
                        heavenly punishment of these &quot;sins&quot;; and, yet, for all the
                        length of time these horrors have been &quot;known&quot; or insisted
                        upon or pointed out, and regardless of whether they are really true or not,
                        is there any marked diminution of the so-called sex evil in America? Has the
                        denying of drink or prophylactics to the American sailor or soldier cured
                        him of his interest in sex? Will it? The world apparently, or that part of
                        it expressed by, in or through the sexes, is as avid and seeking as ever. We
                        know, or some of us do, that the chemistry by which we and the sex impulse
                        are compounded is above <pb id="VAA2441-140" n="131"/> the knowledge or
                        volition of man, although its object in so far as human moods and passions
                        are concerned, is plain enough. But in America we are not willing, if we do
                        know, to admit it. Our increasing numerical presence here should be evidence
                        enough of its force, but we waive that in favor of our theories in regard to
                        the inherently moral and Christian homeeven the complete suppression of sex!
                        That a balance or equation between excess and license and inane,
                        mollusc-like passivism in regard to sex and its expression is all that is
                        ever struck in Nature, is plain enough to those who think; but that an
                        American in authority in state or church should admit it! Life, apparently,
                        is never exact in anything, and the desirability of having it so is of
                        course open to question. But still</p>
                    <p>Yet, to me, the impulses we are trying to suppress are, this side of excess,
                        perfectly normal, while the thing we think we want is an infantile
                        conception of life and its processes, unsuited to thinking men and women.
                        Our conviction is apparently that sexuality is essentially wrong and
                        debasing, and yet we do not really think so, as our intense national
                        interest in every phase of sex proves. We are afraid to face ourselves
                        honestly and openly in anything, neurotically so, and that is what makes the
                        American intellect so utterly contemptible and negligible at times. What is
                        nearer the truth is that our attitude is to be psychoanalytically traced in
                        various ways to the strangely exaggerated (neurotic, I think) conceptions of
                        the part sex or its over-emphasis plays in life due to repression, which
                        have followed upon impossible religious theories brought from abroad
                        (Quaker, Methodist, Puritan, Mennonite, Catholic), and our reaction to them.
                        These have developed that repressive social and biologic ignorance regarding
                        sex characteristic of so many American families, offspring of these sects
                        even when they are no longer of them. The conviction that sex is debasing,
                        dominant at least at this time in nearly every American mind, I believe, is
                        to be traced so often to these <pb id="VAA2441-141" n="132"/> earlier
                        experiences, particularly with regard to parents and their views. The
                        average American childand I suppose England is not much better, judging by
                        their novels and moralsis permitted to base its ideals of life and social
                        relations, especially sex relations, on this earlier pretense on the part of
                        parents that sex does not existfor them at least.</p>
                    <p>So it is that we find adult boys and girls pretending, even to themselves,
                        that they do not know what sex is and the manner in which children come into
                        existence, and preachers and pretending thinkers speaking and writing as
                        though sex were not an all but dominant force in life. And instead of
                        viewing this inconceivably dull attitude as something that needs
                        modification and bringing ourselves to the realization that there is nothing
                        inherently disgraceful about having sexual desire, or at least knowledge of
                        it, and of eventually gratifying it, we allow ourselves to be kept in tow of
                        crack-brained religionists and ethic mongers who insist on painting our very
                        normal natures as abnormal and so developing national neuroses and psychoses
                        which make us ridiculous, not only to ourselves but to every other nation.
                        It has even succeeded in twisting our judgments in regard to politics and
                        economics. For without a rational conception of the part, and the very
                        normal part, sex plays in life, how can there be sanity in these other
                        things? One cannot be wrong as to one vital point in life and right as to
                        all others. We continue to assert, as a nation and as individuals, that
                        everything sexual is wrong, while at the same time having sexual feelings
                        and impulses which we can scarcely disguise even to ourselves and which we
                        satisfy or over-compensate for in ways too ridiculous to mention (a Billy
                        Sunday revival, for instance; a White Slave Crusade in which our papers
                        blaze with sickening criticism; an insane, an impossible pursuit of money or
                        vice, due to the repression of every other normal instinct). Truly, a goose
                        nailed to the floor by its feet and stuffed daily to produce an enlarged and
                        salable liver, could <pb id="VAA2441-142" n="133"/> be no more ridiculous or
                        pathetic than the average American debarred from every avenue of
                        intelligence or effort save that which relates to money.</p>
                    <p>It is a bit curious, one cannot help remarking, that the widespread fame and
                        weight of such sincere and eminent investigators as Kraft-Ebbing, Ellis,
                        Freud and his host of followers, with all the profoundly moving evidence of
                        the pathos of sex-repression which they offer, has not had more influence
                        upon our national, if not the world&apos;s international, mind. The
                        sorrows revealed! The grisly prison doors unlocked by the patient and
                        brilliantly revealing researches of Freud alone! The old sorrows dragged
                        from the depths of the repressed subconscious and at last permitted to come
                        forth into the light, where the fortuitous and yet crushing weight of
                        earthly illusion and error may be noted! And yet they have not apparently as
                        yet enlightened or broadened us.</p>
                    <p>At this point I would like to present a citation from the writings of one of
                        our leading neurologists and psychoanalysts (H. W. Frink) in regard to the
                        type of patient (neurotic) pouring in upon him from all parts of America,
                        &quot;My own experience,&quot; he writes (&quot;Morbid Fears and
                        Compulsions,&quot; page 224), &quot;is that the sexual factor comes
                        to expression in every analysis at once, usually within the first two or
                        three visits, and I am sure that for this result no special technique or
                        dexterities are required; about all that is necessary being to let the
                        patient talk. To the question, Why is the sexual factor dominant in every
                        neurosis? I shall not attempt to make any detailed reply. The answer is
                        perhaps to be sought in the direction indicated by Meyer
                        (&quot;Discussion of Some Fundamental Issues in Freud&apos;s
                        Psychoanalysis,&quot; State Hospital Bulletin, Vol. II, No. 4, 1910),
                        when he says: &apos;No experience or part of our life is as much
                        disfigured by convention as the sex feelings and ambitions.&apos; That
                        is to say, if we had other impulses which throughout the whole life of the
                        individual were <pb id="VAA2441-143" n="134"/> so consistently and
                        unremittingly warped, cramped and deformed in every conceivable and
                        unnatural manner (as they are in America) and they had the same strength to
                        rebel against such treatment as have the sex impulses, <hi rend="i"
                            >then</hi> we might have neuroses in which they and not the sex factor
                        played the dominant role.&quot;</p>
                    <p>For my own part, I cannot understand why it is that the human mind, and more
                        especially the American or Anglo-Saxon mind, unless it is regulated by
                        biogenetic forces over which it has no control but which have full control
                        over it, functions so dully in regard to sex and its import. One would
                        assume, from the average religious or social conception of the time, that
                        the sole function of sex in all its ramifications is the production of more
                        children, to live, work and die according to the prescribed routine of the
                        dullest Christian formula. But, unquestionably, sex means much more than
                        that. While it is true that some of the minor professors of psychoanalysis
                        are offering what they are pleased to term the &quot;sublimation of the
                        holophilic (or sex) impulse&quot; into more &quot;useful,&quot;
                        or, at any rate, more agreeable fields of effort via suppression or
                        restraint, this in my judgment is little more than a sop, and an obvious
                        one, to the moralists. What is actually true is that via sex gratificationor
                        perhaps better, its ardent and often defeated pursuitcomes most of all that
                        is most distinguished in art, letters and our social economy and progress
                        generally. It may be and usually is &quot;displaced.&quot;
                        &quot;referred,&quot; &quot;transferred,&quot;
                        &quot;substituted by,&quot; &quot;identified with&quot;
                        desires for wealth, preferment, distinction and what not, but underneath
                        each and every one of such successes must primarily be written a deep and
                        abiding craving for women, or some one woman, in whom the sex desires of any
                        one person for the time being is centered. &quot;Love&quot; or
                        &quot;lust&quot; (and the one is but an intellectual sublimation of
                        the other) moves the seeker in every field of effort. It is the desire to
                        enthrone and <pb id="VAA2441-144" n="135"/> enhance, by every possible
                        detail of ornamentation, comfort and colorlove, sensual gratificationthat
                        man in the main moves, and by that alone. Protean as this impulse may be,
                        and it takes many forms, it stands revealed as the underlying reality of a
                        thousand astounding impulses or disguises pathetic, lying, simulating,
                        denying, but the same old impulse everywhere and under all circumstances.
                        Refracted as it is by opposition, misunderstanding, failure into a million
                        glistering and lovely or pathetic things, it may seem to be what it is not;
                        but hold fast, trace it back, and there, at bottom, sex appears, a craving
                        for love, and its accompanying sensual gratification, and there is no
                        other.</p>
                    <p>But the thing which is especially interesting about America is its infantile
                        blindness to all this and the pathetic and at least semi-neurotic condition
                        into which we have fallen in consequence. As one views American life to-day
                        it can be safely asserted that scarcely one of a hundred American men or
                        women view this phase of life intelligibly, although they respond to it
                        normally enough in some of its other phases. Usually before their so-called
                        vision, and between them and their daily deeds, hangs an inane and miasmatic
                        cloud of cant and make-believe. The physiologically and biologically
                        informed know, of course, how ridiculous is the assumption that sex union is
                        the narrowly &quot;moral&quot; function which the religionists would
                        have one believe, although moral it may well be in some larger constructive
                        sense, as is any other life process, if life itself can be termed moral. But
                        that it can involve, without becoming profoundly ridiculous, a narrow or
                        sectarian religious interpretation, is open to question. That it has a sad,
                        tragic, even ruthless aspect (read Maeterlinck&apos;s description of the
                        struggles of some flowers to be born and continue the species) is not,
                        scientifically at least, to be combatted. In its biological aspects it has
                        many, many tragic sides, although so dull is the race to all but its most
                        individual <pb id="VAA2441-145" n="136"/> ambitions and needs that it cannot
                        be expected to sense this either. Indeed, as expressed by the impulses in
                        man (concocted by what psychic meditation below and on the part of what?),
                        sex is an unregenerate and only partially controlled passion which has more
                        as its aim perhaps than is dreamed of in the philosophies of man. It is a
                        fire, a chemical explosion, really. It concerns not so much the individual
                        as the race, the endless unbroken chain of men and women, however much any
                        individual may think it concerns him alone. Instead of denouncing the
                        individual for his mmod in regard to all this, it might be more important to
                        inquire how moral in their import are the elements which compound and bring
                        about the explosion and to treat him as one of their victims</p>
                    <p>The truth no doubt is that in this much-maligned impulse which chemical
                        forces beyond and above the willing of men are compounding lies the destiny
                        of man (if he has one), only we are not as yet able to fathom that destiny.
                        Here we come, bottles of fluid dynamite (prepared by what satiric
                        super-soul, and why?), and somewhere in the world is, or may be, another
                        compound which will set us aflameand we are supposed to connect this with a
                        narrow religious order or theory! I will admit that for the necessities of
                        social arrangement and relationship here, the necessary balances and
                        inter-adjust-ments that go to make up a workable society of beings, some
                        form of equation between the less and more avid sexually, the too hot and
                        the too cold, must be and is struck, willynilly and regardless of individual
                        or man&apos;s moral theory. But by what rule and rote? Is there
                        so-called &quot;justice&quot; in it, or &quot;reason,&quot;
                        or a fixed social order or method of procedure? We see that in spite of our
                        fixed methods of moral procedure the tragedies continue, the waves and
                        flames of morality and immorality come and go. Our divorce rate! Our sex
                        tragedies and districts! And what guide has the individual? The Golden Rule?
                        A more liberal method of adjustment? In the <pb id="VAA2441-146" n="137"/>
                        past, Nature has tolerated polygamy, polyandry and an abbreviated monogamy,
                        and may do so again. The stress and strain which the present social
                        arrangements show are almost premonitory.</p>
                    <p>But one thing is certain: no hard-and-fast rule governing this impulse has
                        worked with accuracy for any given length of time, anywhere. If there are
                        discovered or discoverable rules for its control and best management in the
                        interest of the race and so in the interest of the Creator they have not yet
                        been announced. We hear of the duty of preserving the sanctity of the home,
                        maintaining a wife and raising a family according to the monogamic theory.
                        Well and good. But, outside of raising endless children to be said in wars,
                        vegetated in a routine factory life, worn threadbare in a vast and
                        internecine struggle for existence, there is not so much to be said for
                        that, either. Routine home life, even an artistic breeding-pen, can scarcely
                        be the be-all and end-all of human existence, any more than may unrestrained
                        license. And however comfortable or admirable or encouraging the average
                        home may be to given individuals, it is not necessarily so to all. There are
                        those who find it confining, destroying. And, again, religionists and
                        theorists, moral and otherwise, as well as the great greedy syndics and
                        master minds in business or politics, prey upon the fruit of the home and
                        collect &quot;spiritual&quot; and material taxes and establish
                        &quot;spiritual&quot; as well as material autocracies or
                        over-lordships which in no wise make for sex morality any more than for the
                        forces which destroy it. Vice, suborned by the wealthy and powerful, as well
                        as the avid and perverse among the weak, feeds upon the fruit of the
                        so-called moral home. The bull seal still conquers his fifty or a hundred,
                        and the weakling none. In fact, in a so-called Christian realm the mistress
                        abounds, and the high divorce rate attests much private dissatisfaction with
                        the theory. Laws come and laws go; and still we are about where we were
                        before. The <pb id="VAA2441-147" n="138"/> gardens of Aphrodite still exist.
                        The hetaera of Greece and Rome are still with usin our back streets or our
                        high-priced apartment houses. If we no longer have our streets of the
                        so-called &quot;fallen&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; women, who
                        walk in the dark, is it not because caution has become the better part of
                        trade? Are they not to be found behind closed doors in response to special
                        rings, by card of admission, in our best streets? The endless pother! And
                        still sex is as vigorous and dominant as ever it was. The riant scoffers nod
                        and smile and accept the new rules.</p>
                    <p>Personally, after all this time, my conclusion is: (1), that no individual,
                        however well or ill compounded physically, can make or unmake his moods or
                        add one jot or tittle to his moral desires or perfections, although he and
                        society (or convention) can exercise a certain amount of restrainta
                        restraint that will almost invariably prove irksome and which he will seek
                        to evade; (2), that however much theorists, hypocrites and sincere
                        religionists, chill-blooded or otherwise, may revile sex or attempt to
                        restrain or destroy it, yet Nature (God or the devil, or the two in one)
                        permits these wild fires to be generated in man, and, in spite of all
                        punishments and hindrances, sees to it that his passions overleap his fears
                        and judgments and cause him to do all the things that may be strictly
                        forbidden him but which may nevertheless be of value to the race itself;
                        (3), that man is not temperamentally or chemically a monogamous animal,
                        however much the social conditions and necessities by which he finds himself
                        surrounded in certain lands and times tend to make him believe so or fear,
                        and that a rough balance or equation is all that is ever struck between his
                        outward public deeds and his inner chemic condition; (4), that, to this
                        hour, there is no city without its percentage of prostitution or hetaera of
                        one grade or another; (5), that there is no city or town where some women or
                        girls do not walk, secretly or openly, to accomplish prostitution <pb
                            id="VAA2441-148" n="139"/> and where men do not, secretly or openly,
                        encourage and pursue them, the chemic necessities of their being as much as
                        poverty impelling them to do it; (6), that there is no city or town or
                        countryside, anywhere, where adultery or fornication is not indulged in
                        outside wedlock for love or pleasure; (7), that a high percentage of men in
                        all walks, including priests and clergymen, look after some one type at
                        least of woman and lust after her; (8), that a moderate percentage of women,
                        in marriage and out, seek the affection of a given type of man
                        temperamentally or chemically agreeable or appealing to them, and offer
                        their bodies as a bid for or sacrifice to that affection; (9), that women
                        crave monogamy where their affections or the interests of their children are
                        involved; (10), that love of one woman or one man, or their several or joint
                        love of children, is likely to overlay and put at rest, for the time being,
                        the usual roving desires of sex; (11), that law in all special instances is
                        absolutely helpless before passion, powerless either to interpret its
                        psychology or fix a just measure of praise or blame; (12), that convention
                        has not made, and cannot make, any headway against a chemical scheme of life
                        which puts sex desires first and all else as secondary or socially
                        contributory.</p>
                    <p>Do I seem illogical or inclined to exaggerate? Think well over the things I
                        have said. The world has a partially traceable history covering more than
                        ten thousand years; in that time nations have risen and fallen, law codes
                        have come and gone, religions have dominated and been swept away. In no law
                        code and in no religion of any nation has the sex question, the need of
                        moderation, duty to family and the like, been ignored. But in all that time
                        the social expression of sex has never been so much as modified, let alone
                        done away with. The Mosaic law is all of three thousand years old, yet what
                        has it availed? Are our women all pure, our men all moral? Yet, in the face
                        of history and present-day occurrences, the <pb id="VAA2441-149" n="140"/>
                        facts of divorce courts, night courts, streets crowded with prostitution and
                        kept women, men seeking constantly to lure women, and vice versa, all the
                        million and one evidences in books, plays, newspapers and social life
                        generally that sex is the keynote of existence, there are those who would
                        bar all mention of it, harry the prostitute, unduly punish the fornicator,
                        ostracise the woman who strays from the path of virtue or seeks in divorce a
                        way out of a troubled marital state.</p>
                    <p>What to make of the brain of man under such circumstances? What to say of the
                        thing that causes him to fight the passion of which he is a victim?
                        Necessity for equation and balance in all things, a very rough balance which
                        cares no more for the individual &quot;good&quot; or
                        &quot;bad&quot; than we care for flies or gnats? Inherent love of
                        moderation in some? Love of peace in some? Love of the reverse in others?
                        The tendency of all things to become static, even passionate temperaments?
                        Surely that, and nothing more. Yet, aside from that, there is something
                        which does not care for the equation-seeking mood of either individuals or
                        society, which is busy manufacturing and pouring into the world new
                        individuals with all their new dreams, passions, lacks of equation, lack of
                        a sense of self-restraint, and sweeping away the old, the conservative, the
                        religious, sanctimonious.</p>
                    <p>One of the sanifying recourses in life is, of course, to fix one&apos;s
                        eye on youth and note what it desires. Plainly, it is a fair expression of
                        the thing that creates it, the chemic mood of the biologic force, for
                        plainly it is closer to that which creates it. As the human or physical
                        machine ages and wears out it is prepared, and then only, to accept the
                        restraints and the equation which society, in order to maintain itself,
                        requires; but not before. In the main, youth blazes with non-equational
                        fires and it best represents that which makes it, the concocting chemic
                        impulses below or behind life. Is youth wrong? Then so is the life impulse,
                        for it builds youth freshly to its needs <pb id="VAA2441-150" n="141"/>
                        yearly, daily. The physical laws which seem to govern the biologic impulse
                        after it expresses itself in the shape of youth, or man, and compels it for
                        purposes of social expression to submit to restraints and equation, is
                        another matter, inherent, perhaps, in the constitution of the universe
                        itself and not to be avoided by the biologic impulse or its creatures. But
                        this, as I have said before, does not provide us with <hi rend="i"
                            >exact</hi> rules for conducting ourselves here or how best to subdue or
                        balance with other things the enormous fires with which we sometimes find
                        ourselves lit. Better admit at once that hard-and-fast and cock-sure rules
                        or laws are of no avail, and trust to the crude accidents of life to caution
                        youth. A happy balance between the fires of youth and the fears and chills
                        of age may be desirable, but, freely admitting that, can it be fixed by
                        exact rule? We are inherent in some greater thing than manNature Herself.
                        Only She knows.</p>
                    <p>One thing is sure: we are not done with the conflict and amazing
                        super-impulses of sex, and are not likely to be soon. And if we were, would
                        life be the varied, fascinating, humorous, poetic, tragic thing we see it to
                        be? Suppose the moralists ruled, with their stiff and narrow balance, and
                        man accepted their quiescent dictatesthen what? Contrast it with some of the
                        freer, more distinguished periodsGreece, Rome, Italy during the Renaissance.
                        France under the Louis, England under Elizabeth and Charles II. Consider. I
                        for one see no immediate solution, and firmly believe there is none which
                        does not end in complete mental quiescencebalance or its equivalent,
                        intellectual and emotional or temperamental nothingness, decay and
                        dissolution, with something not so balanced and therefore alive, to
                        supersede, if we are to have any form of life at all.</p>

                        befog or misinterpret a world which needs to be seen quite clearly if man is
                        even partially to understand himself or the conditions by which he is
                        confronted, it is well to remember that life is secret, nearly entirely so,
                        in all its phases. Nature reveals Her secrets to no man, save grudgingly and
                        peradventure. By dint of slow searching and because of his own necessities
                        and sufferings he has discovered a few thingshow few, as contrasted with the
                        vast sea of the all but undiscoverable, not even the wisest can guess. And,
                        even so, it is all a process of inclusion, and hence exclusion. How little
                        included? And how much excluded? And Her secrecy is by no means moral or
                        ethical or generous in any way. Yet, confronted by all the iron and pagan
                        mysteries of a catch-as-catch-can world, and seeing daily and hourly that
                        only the strong or shrewd or gifted, or those befriended by them, survive,
                        and the weak and untalented are left to fester in want, and that only a
                        rather loose and not very protective or comforting balance or equation is
                        struck between extremes of any kind (even between his so-called God and
                        devil), man still persists in interpreting his needs or hopes or dreams as
                        the result of a super-tender administration of some kind, and sniffs rather
                        disconsolately, if not quite unbelievingly, at the hard facts by which he is
                        confronted. He is so anxious to think Nature kind, generous, non-secret.
                        Indeed, any well-reared-and-ordered moralist or religionist would be
                        inclined to contend, I am sure, that the world is not in the main secret,
                            <pb id="VAA2441-152" n="143"/> or at least not maliciously so, and that,
                        even if it is, it should not beinnate desire for balance and equation
                        between so-called evil and good always urging him to this conclusion.</p>
                    <p>But, Nature is secret, quite maliciously so at times, and Her secrecy is not
                        to be escaped, even by those most anxious to condemn that phase of Her
                        character. All of us, as a part of Her, reflect this chiefest characteristic
                        as well as the most powerful instinct implanted in us by Hernamely, the
                        desire to preserve ourselves and propagate our kind as against the lives and
                        interests of all others. And, being confronted also by one of Her sternest
                        regulations, that only the shrewd, the cunning, the appropriate or desired
                        or presently essential or fit shall survive when assailed by millions of
                        other creatures not so fortunately equipped, we are compelled to admit that
                        we are at least a part of a more or less internecine struggle and so do our
                        best, willy-nilly, as time and occasion may warrant or suggest to escape via
                        secrecy, intrigue, cunning and the like. In other words, we are compelled to
                        conceal that which is important to us and possibly inimical to others,
                        showing, in times of stress, only that which will help us; hence, we, along
                        with everything else, are compelled to be secret whether we wish to or
                        not.</p>
                    <p>It may be mentioned here that there is a certain fish whose scientific name
                        is Mycteroperca Bonaci and whose common name is Black Grouper, which is of
                        considerable value in this connection. It is a healthy creature, growing to
                        a weight of two hundred and fifty pounds and living a comfortable existence
                        because of its very remarkable ability to adapt itself to conditions. Now
                        while that very subtle thing which we call the creative power and which we
                        endow with the spirit of the Beatitudes is supposed to build this mortal
                        life in such fashion that only honesty and virtue shall prevail, still it
                        builds this fish. Moving in its dark world of green waters, Mycteroperca <pb
                            id="VAA2441-153" n="144"/> has the very essence of secrecy, the power of
                        almost instantaneous change into something quite different in so far as
                        appearances are concerned. Its great superiority over other fishes lies in
                        an almost unbelievable power of simulation, which relates solely to the
                        pigmentation of its skin. In electrical mechanics we pride ourselves on our
                        ability to make over one brilliant scene into another in the twinkling of an
                        eye and flash picture after picture before the onlooker. The directive
                        control of Mycteroperca over its appearance is so wonderful that you cannot
                        look at it long without feeling that you are witnessing something spectral
                        and unnatural, so brilliant is its power to deceive. Lying at the bottom of
                        a bay, it can simulate the mud by which it is surrounded. Hidden in the
                        folds of glorious leaves, it is of the same markings. Lurking in a flaw of
                        light, it is like the light itself shining dimly in water. Its power to
                        elude or strike unseen is of the greatest. One might go far afield and
                        gather less forceful indictmentsthe horrific spider spinning his trap for
                        the unthinking fly; the lovely Drosera (Sundew) using its crimson calyx for
                        a smothering-pit in which to seal and devour the victim of its beauty; the
                        rainbow-colored jellyfish that spreads its prismed tentacles like streamers
                        of great beauty, only to sting and torture all that falls within their
                        radiant folds. Man himself is busy digging the pit and fashioning the snare,
                        but he will not believe it. His feet are in the trap of circumstances; his
                        eyes are on an illusion.</p>
                    <p>But what would you say was the intention of the overruling intelligent,
                        constructive force which gives to Mycteroperca this ability? To fit it to be
                        truthful? Or would you say that subtlety, chicanery, trickery were here at
                        work? An implement of illusion one might readily suspect it to be, a living
                        lie, a creature whose business it is to appear what it is not, to simulate
                        that with which it has nothing in common, the power of its enemies to
                        forfend against which is little. The indictment is fair.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2441-154" n="145"/>
                    <p>Yet is it not ridiculous that where all Nature is working in shadow, each
                        thing hiding from the other its processes or thoughts of power and its
                        intentions, that we ask of poor, spindling, cowardly, scurrying man, dodging
                        perpetually here and there between the giant legs of chance and, in so far
                        as he is concerned, all but malign forces, that he stand up and speak <hi
                            rend="i">the truth</hi> in all things (would that he could discover it!)
                        or that he say boldly and on all occasions what is in his heart, what are
                        his intentions? Of old we know that men do not, anywhere, save in consonance
                        with their interests, and yet the silly, self-interested request persists; a
                        demonstration of how thought or observation and deduction and principally
                        self-interest lag behind fact. The only thing which opposes secrecy and
                        brings it to light is the skill for secrecy in others; another illustration
                        of the law of balance or equation in Nature, the necessity of give and take
                        in life, the desire of the other person to be protected from too much
                        secrecy on the part of others. But the folly of the appeal in its ideal
                        form, the charm that would disappear with the arrival of absolute frankness,
                        the mystery that would go!</p>
                    <p>Ninety-nine and ninety-nine one-hundredths of all the interest or charm of
                        all the creatures of the earth and of the circumstances and spaces and
                        conditions in which they find themselves, is the secrecyor, what is the
                        same, the mystery or subtletywhich attaches to them. We do not know them; we
                        do not understand them; we wonder at their states, their thoughts, their
                        moods, what they will do, which way turn, when attacked, whom attack, whom
                        deceive, whom praise, whom reward. Secrecysecrecymystery. If it were gone
                        the illusion of life itself, which is all that it is, would be gone also.
                        And we are cautioned to love truth and to say truly and to our own hurt if
                        necessary! And some advocate this so earnestly as part of the service due
                        the other person, or of life to us. Yet, in the main, it comes to this:
                        every other is to speak the truth to <hi rend="i">us</hi>, to conceal no
                        important fact that <pb id="VAA2441-155" n="146"/> might be helpful to us
                        from <hi rend="i">us</hi>, to do justice to <hi rend="i">us</hi>, to think
                        kindly of <hi rend="i">us.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>A fine program, and absolutely consonant with our desire to live, prosper,
                        succeed, regardless of the well-being of every other.</p>
                    <p>But let us reverse the program and advocate to ourselves, even in jest, that
                        we do strict justice (if we could discover what that might be) to every
                        other or tell him the exact truth about ourselves (heaven forbid!), our
                        adventures, dreams, schemes; to think kindly (yes, even to think kindly in
                        the face of the little that we know) of him. The Catholic hierarchywhich, by
                        the way, has little to do with Messianic Christianity and its fine-spun
                        idealsso thoroughly understood human nature of the middle centuries as well
                        as to-day that it introduced as an intermediary between man and his own
                        conscience, his private shames, regrets, fears: the confessional (secrecy)
                        in order that the average individual might free his soul of crimes without
                        exposing himself to the fierce light of criticism which a public confession
                        or truth-telling would entail. And the hesitation and even shame, for all
                        its cloak of secrecy, with which the confessional is approached! The Church
                        knew that man was not equal to the task of confronting his own accusing
                        conscience in the open or before others but must confess in secret, if at
                        all. Hence the drawn curtain and the reward of absolution for
                        confession!</p>
                    <p>War, in the main the result of economic pressure, is an illustration of the
                        necessity for secrecy, or rather the methods by which war is madestrategy,
                        no less. Mere brute numbers clouting each other to obtain a numerical
                        supremacy is nothing. A soldier worthy the rank of corpora! would smile at
                        such a program. Secrecy is the thing, the devising of traps and lures
                        whereby the enemy may be betrayed and to his undoing. The spider weaving his
                        net, the trapper devising his traps, the snake moving in grasses the color
                        of itself, is no different to the general who by strategy (and what general
                        without strategy <pb id="VAA2441-156" n="147"/> is worthy the name?) seeks
                        to encompass the enemy. Shakespeare in Macbeth, by means of the witches,
                        suggests so archly the value of secrecy to the so-called good or just (in
                        that instance MacDuff) in fighting evil (Macbeth) by having the soldiery of
                        MacDuff simulate Birnam Wood by cutting off and carrying the branches of its
                        trees towards his castle, thus lyingly fulfilling the prophecy of the
                        witches to Macbeth that he should not be injured until Birnam Wood should
                        rise and come against him, and so destroying his self-confidence. And,
                        indeed, is not stark, threatening secrecy, non-moral force that it is, the
                        thing which gives color if not joy to life and which lends surprise,
                        uncertainty, fear and hence freedom from ennui to life, and, by contrast,
                        hope and calculation, the greatest and most charming of all our gifts? For
                        what game or sport, implying, as they do, friendly contest, would be worthy
                        the name if it did not involve the element of chance or uncertainty, or, in
                        other words, secrecy, to the extent that one cannot beforehand determine the
                        outcome?</p>
                    <p>Again, are not all of our ambitions, if not as to their purport at least as
                        to their outcome, secret? Nature provides secrecy, or uncertainty, which is
                        the same thing, or darkness as a condition for the development of quite
                        everything, from seeds to human plans, and builds and builds with us in
                        countless ways and to astonishing results, and yet we are not permitted to
                        share Her secret. Our petty brains and bodies are but mere implements of
                        sorts in Her hands whereby She is constructing something, the significance
                        or purpose of which we cannot even guess and which She is at no pains to
                        reveal. She builds us to contain, or rather to comprehend, but a modicum, a
                        minute fragment, of the enormous information or secret which is Hers.
                        Secrecy on Her part, you see.</p>
                    <p>If one turns to the pages of science, what a masterly array of natural
                        diplomacy and artifice is there displayed! The fishes of the sea imitating
                        the coloring of the grasses or shadows of the deep in which they hide and by
                        means of <pb id="VAA2441-157" n="148"/> which they escape their enemies
                        (protective coloring is the scientific name); insects the same, in so far as
                        foliage and grasses are concerned; birds the same; reptiles the same; man,
                        for all his noble theories and dreams of a generous and unselfish mode of
                        conduct, the same; as artificial and secretive as any, he. The stripling
                        lawyer imitates the look and manner of his intellectual superiorwords,
                        phrases, carriage, side-whiskers evenin order to seem his equal, or in other
                        words to conceal (secrecy, you see) the fact that he is not his equal from
                        some trusting and unsophisticated client. Protective coloring, as it
                        were.</p>
                    <p>Take again the instance of a man beginning to rise financially and wishing to
                        appear the equivalent of men far richer than himself. His office is in their
                        vicinity, his residence in their neighborhood. He is in their club if
                        possible, their church, their directories. He is not as rich as they are,
                        but wishes to conceal the fact. It is not good for the world to know that he
                        is not what he is not. His few public deeds would not be as acceptable or he
                        would be compelled to doff the uniform he so much desires to wear, the
                        manners, along possibly with the emoluments thereof, or the hope of them.
                        Secrecysecrecysecrecy. A seeming only, where reality would leave life bare
                        and hard.</p>
                    <p>And is it not the same with doctors, merchants, professionals of all kinds?
                        To this day is not medicine, like most other professions, fond of mystery
                        and secrecy. . . . Latin for instance, in preparing its prescriptions,
                        thereby giving them an air of superiority which is not necessarily there at
                        all, or to prevent the patient from knowing what is being put into his
                        stomach, or to make the cure seem more formidable by being mysterious or
                        secret. And to this hour, lawyers delighting in magnificently darksome
                        briefs, which in simple language would be understandable to all and far less
                        fearsome. Again, religion, the Catholic and many other versions, rejoicing
                        in a ritual which, if presented or sung in English, would be just as
                        impressive <pb id="VAA2441-158" n="149"/> to the really intelligent if it
                        possessed any genuine merit or appeal. But to the ignorant laity, according
                        to the thoughts of the churchman, it might not be; hence the Latin. And
                        perhaps it is as it should be, for do not the ignorant and the savage
                        invariably crave that which they cannot understand? It may be that they
                        desire something more symbolic of all they feel but cannot express, a
                        quantity and quality of mysterious inner moods and emotions which no human
                        spoken words, especially those of their own tongue, would even suggest.</p>
                    <p>Hence the priest and preacher, Shi&apos;ite or Sunnite, Dervish,
                        Buddhist, or Brahman formalist, one and all, although ordinary human beings
                        like ourselves, are trained, and most carefully, in the protective coloring
                        of their profession. For essentially they are no different, or, with very
                        rare exception, no more spiritual, no more self-sacrificialin other words,
                        no more unnaturalthan any of their fellows. But, in due process of time, the
                        manners, customs, rules even of those who by chance or peradventure (the
                        accident of disposition or revulsion from too much of something else) have
                        been tender, self-sacrificial, humanitarian, have given these latter their
                        cue. They now know, let us say, what &quot;good&quot; or
                        self-restraining or humanity-loving men and women in times past have, at one
                        time and another, been like, how they walked in humility, denied themselves
                        the pleasures, even the necessities of life, divided a cloak with a beggar
                        or gave it whole, went with an importunate enemy two miles instead of one,
                        turned the other cheek to one who had smitten them on one, gave the last of
                        money or food to one who was hungered, shelter to the shelterless, warmth to
                        the cold, ignored frivolity or laughter because of so much existing misery.
                        And so those who, without performing similar discomforting services, would
                        like to appear thus, now know what to do, how such an one, assuming that he
                        minister to the weak, the erring, the deficient, should conduct himself, his
                        most appropriate airs, manners, moods. Hencebut does <pb id="VAA2441-159"
                            n="150"/> one need to call attention to the vast system of protective
                        coloring which now produces saviors, samaritans, ministers by the hundreds
                        of thousands throughout the world, all presumably embracing the qualities
                        which make the self-sacrificial character important, if it is important, yet
                        who perform few if any of those deeds which the coloring implies: the
                        &quot;cloth,&quot; the hats, the reversed collars, the severe <hi
                            rend="i">black</hi>, sign of abstemiousness, self-sacrifice, putting
                        aside of the vanities, shows and pleasures of this world.</p>
                    <p>Of course there is always the rare individual born so strong, so wise, so
                        courageous, that he needs few if any disguises in order to make life
                        palatable to him, or his way in it. But he is rare, and, even when present,
                        may not always proceed with ease or fearlessly but must disguise the courage
                        and intelligence which he possesses (secrecy). Even he, when dealing with
                        weaker, as well as stronger, individuals and groups, dare not show forth his
                        true strength, save in their behalf, unless he would evoke their destroying
                        anger. For masses, lacking power as to their individual units, are
                        infuriated by one who is not so constituted, who offends by his strength
                        their own fu tility. All lesser strengths, whether represented by
                        individuals or masses, are envious and jealous of power. And the strong hate
                        the strong quite as much as they do the weak when the latter are opposed to
                        them. And, vice versa, the weak look upon the strong as driving masters, but
                        the strong look upon the strong as rivals seeking power equal to their own,
                        or equal to the task of displacing them. Hence their bitter and destructive
                        rage; the hate of tiger for tiger, for instance, bull for bull. Secrecy,
                        secrecy, here as elsewhere apparently the best policy Nature has been able
                        to devise the only or the essential one, the one most employed. Truly the
                        wise, however powerful, disguise their power and wisdom. They go softly,
                        speak kindly, advocate justice or equation in all things, as well they may,
                        seeing that they themselves may stand in need <pb id="VAA2441-160" n="151"/>
                        of it at any turn; and, if they work their will, work it in the dark and
                        alone as much as possible.</p>
                    <p>What, then, shall we say of life when confronted by truths such as thesethat
                        it is offensive, unbearable, a thing to be wept over, shunned, departed from
                        as quickly as possible? I think not. Nature has always been so, and men for
                        millions of years have undertaken life with all its difficulties and
                        subtleties and have done well enough. Indeed, they have thrived, like all
                        those who sharpen their souls against difficulty. It is Nature&apos;s
                        way. With steel She cuts steel, with subtlety subtlety, and the whole
                        process appears to be one in which a more capable device for enduring the
                        inherent restlessness and changefulness of Nature Herself is steadily
                        prepared. It is one of dull wit upon whom, like barnacles, illusions fasten.
                        And he is in error who assumes that the processes of Nature are different
                        from those of man. We are like life, like the chemicals and forces of which
                        we are composed, and have always been so. Only theory and dogma, growing
                        upon and obscuring sluggish minds, have permitted the rise of a
                        contra-conception. We should brush the cobwebs from our eyes and do away
                        with illusion. In so far as possible, and as did the gladiators of old, we
                        should face life with such weapons as we may, some with raw strength and
                        short sword and shield, others with net and trident; one relying on brute
                        Strength if need must, the other on the skill and craft with which he may
                        enmesh and slay. There is no other way. Life is so, and only the cowardly or
                        the dull or the weak will either fail to see or endeavor to evade so solemn
                        and even terrible a truth.</p>

                    <head>IDEALS, MORALS, AND THE DAILY NEWSPAPER</head>
                    <p>FOR two centuries now if not longer the newspapers, rather than the preachers
                        and reformers generally who precede and still parallel them, have been
                        elevating themselves to the roles of soothsayer, prophet, and guardians of
                        all phases of virtue, honesty and the like, to say nothing of those
                        shibboleths of the would-be intellectually dominant,
                        &quot;justice&quot; and &quot;truth.&quot; And the
                        particular views of these papers have come to have an undue weight with
                        those so moderately equipped intellectually as to look upon them as moral
                        leaders. Experiments in government and phases of moral self-control, public
                        and private, are there constantly advocated for the good of the other man,
                        yet nearly always in accordance with the current bias or the direction of
                        the interests of the paper. Yet back of these papers, and in spite of a
                        public following which is supposed to regulate or control or suggest their
                        policy and viewpoint, is always, or nearly so, an individual or group of
                        individuals, possibly a self-interested organization (comercial, religious
                        or otherwise) with perhaps no more intellectual grip on the social and
                        spiritual complexities of the world than any other individual of average
                        capacity and judgment possibly not so much. Yet with the tremendous leverage
                        circulation, plus a serviceable and profitable and aggressive counting-room
                        to help out, their moral and social pronunciamentos ridiculously enough
                        become all but sacrosanct, irrefutable, colossal! Yet after all is said and
                        done, here is nothing more than an individual, all too human perhaps, or if
                        not that, a group represented by one individual possibly, seeking via this
                        same lever (circulation) the special, particular things <pb id="VAA2441-162"
                            n="153"/> which he or it or they crave. And as a rule he or his group is
                        truckling and hand-rubbing to that which he or it or they imagine the time
                        requires, but seeking always circulation first, as though that were the
                        be-all and end-all of all value, wisdom and duty.</p>
                    <p>And yet, in America at least, where will you find a citizen who does not to a
                        marked extent reverence the opinions of his paper? The slavish manner in
                        which in certain regions to this day the voters follow a paper and the
                        manner in which the American press has successfully clouded issue after
                        issue since America beganthe currency issue for one, the slavery issue for
                        another, the tariff issue for a third, the trust issue for a fourth, the
                        profiteering and European war issues at the present moment. And where will
                        you find a newspaper not advertising passing panaceas that it knows cannot
                        heal (I am not talking about patent medicines), or admitting that a
                        satisfactory social solution for the woes of the millions cannot be found,
                        or admitting frankly that human law is the wide-spread net that it is,
                        through which great and small alike skip briskly, chance and accident
                        restraining some and releasing others? Only when the big skip through the
                        lesion is greater, We where will you find a newspaper that will freely admit
                        that the Ten Commandments are not after all God-given law (do think for a
                        moment that they privately believe they are), or that they constitute
                        anything more than a form of social agreement based for their validity on
                        the will of the majority not holding where men do not believe them to be
                        true and not followed by any spiritually destructive consequences where men
                        do not accept them to be spiritually true? Life pours through the
                        reportorial, editorial and counting-rooms the average newspaper pell-mell
                        quite as it does elsewhere, only a little more so. Those at the head note
                        well the secrecy, the self-interest, the &quot;policy&quot; running
                        through all things, the struggles of all individuals and organizations to
                        grow, usually at the expense of everything else; yet editorially, and at the
                            <pb id="VAA2441-163" n="154"/> very best, a balance or dependent
                        equation between rival clashing interestsrival, hungry, self-seeking
                        hordesis all that is ever struck here, although this is all but invariably
                        announced as the Sinaitic command of an all-wise, omnipotent, omnipresent
                        intelligence, the newspaper editor or owner posing as its especial
                        mouthpiece and forwarder! Is it not too ridiculous that so human and
                        fallible or greedy and venal a thing as the average newspaper should set
                        itself up to be a moral and at times even a religious arbiter of a
                        community?</p>
                    <p>Yet where would be the circulation of the average paper if it did not so do?
                        And where would it be if it attempted to practice what it preached,
                        literally and for itself, as it so freely advises others to do? As all those
                        well know who have anything to do with the organization or control of
                        anything in life, newspapers included, the Beatitudes, as Christ laid them
                        down in the Sermon on the Mount, are not workable and never have been
                        practically. Yet where will you find a newspaper I honestly so stating, or
                        even whispering a serious doubt? On the contrary, is it not the absolute
                        workability of these that has, hitherto at least, been most violently
                        insisted upon, and by organizations which well know the pagan complexities
                        of life and are in no way representative of even the faintest approach
                        toward a beatific conception of anything? &quot;Do not as I do but as I
                        say.&quot; That only quiescence and decay could follow the enforcement
                        of any such program as the Beatitudes or the fixed rules of justice, truth,
                        etc., advocated by the average daily paper or any one else, is not only
                        scientifically demonstrable by chemistry and physics but is a truism to the
                        average, and even less than average, constructive and even newspaper mind.
                        Nearly every one with any claim to intelligence or experience understands
                        this, yet where will you find a newspaper or any other public medium of
                        expression venturing on this simple truth? The average man is still in
                        leading strings to various silly theories, religious or otherwise, fostered
                        by self-interested groups, or to his hope of temporary <pb id="VAA2441-164"
                            n="155"/> human prosperity, and these are the things which still keep
                        him in the wake of various sophisticated journals which cunningly play upon
                        his illusions. Indeed he flees exact fact as though it were the plague.
                        Blessed words or the sweet milk of romance and prevarication are the things
                        which entertain and soothe him most. In other wordsthink of this ridiculous
                        and paradoxical fact!a creature invents a bugaboo and then kneels down and
                        worships it It forges chains for its so-called intellect, and then groans or
                        rests content under their binding weight.</p>
                    <p>But (to continue this slight diatribe) imagine the staff of any newspaper
                        even attempting to follow any rules save those which govern she survival of
                        the fit, or failing to cast the Beatitudes out of doors when it comes to
                        their special interests or the prosperity of the several functions which
                        they perform! Editorially the Beatitudes prove profitable as texts for moral
                        preachment and mass consumption, but in the counting-office or the gathering
                        of news how different! And as for going two miles with a traveler when he
                        had compelled you to go one or turning the other cheek when the first had
                        been smitten! These things do not fall within the realm of the practical and
                        are therefore not in the purview of any news-paper organization except in
                        the editorial or pulpiteering department, and that intended to catch the
                        pennies of the religionists.</p>
                    <p>So daily we have the spectacle of pages that in one column misrepresent the
                        motives of the social or political enemies of this or that particular
                        newspaper organization, or that play up to the subtleties of vice or crime
                        for their news or dramatic values, or that display to the eyes of the young
                        and old alike all the misadventures and incalculable subterfuges of a
                        treacherous universe, while in another column, constantly reiterated, appear
                        the words right, justice, mercy, truth, tenderness duty, etc., as
                        representing a definite program for conduct for the other person always,
                        easily followed and easily <pb id="VAA2441-165" n="156"/> achievedby him.
                        Yes, for the other person, outside of any given newspaper office, there are
                        always God-given and immutable rules which spell peace and happiness for
                        him, that are invariably to be practiced, if you will believe these same
                        papers, by the majority, especially of their readers. And indeed these rules
                        are by them persistently represented as the will and thought of a definite,
                        definable GodHe who spoke from Sinai, or who walked to Calvary (quite
                        different Gods, by the way!)to fly in the face of whom or which leads only
                        to destruction. Yet all that is needed, as they well know, in so far as a
                        reasonable guide to conduct is concerned (and all that we ever get, whether
                        via the law or the average motivating impulses of man) is the perception and
                        the fact of the necessity for a certain equation or balance in all things,
                        i. e., the Golden Rule, mystic heavens or hells and the clerical
                        representatives of the same with their collections and false notions to the
                        contrary notwithstanding. Yet where will you find a newspaper with
                        sufficient courage to say so? Where? Is it not here that one should pause
                        and inquire whether the newspapers, aside from their purely reportorial
                        functions (which latter might well be vised under stricter libel, perjury
                        and false witness laws than those prevailing at present), should receive so
                        much as even a moment&apos;s serious consideration?</p>

                    <head>EQUATION INEVITABLE<lb/> A VARIANT IN PHILOSOPHIC VIEWPOINT</head>
                    <p>IN society, where man is constantly scheming out methods of procedure and how
                        his ideas and feelings and appetites can be brought to a harmonious workable
                        state, a certain reciprocating smoothness of exchange and balance must be,
                        and apparently has been, achieved. It is like those constructive adjustments
                        which make any machine possible, and has apparently given rise to such
                        conceptions of the necessary conditions for exchange as are indicated by the
                        words &quot;harmony,&quot; &quot;justice,&quot;
                        &quot;truth,&quot; possibly even &quot;tenderness&quot; and
                        &quot;mercy,&quot; all of which mean but one thing, if they mean
                        anything at all: the need of striking a balance or achieving an equilibrium
                        between plalnly restless and conflicting elements. (Why restless? Who knows?
                        Why conflicting? Who knows?) However, it is this same equation or balance
                        which conditions so large a thing as a universe, whose prime impulse
                        apparently is to achieve endless variety in homogeneity, and vice versa.</p>
                    <p>But these have been assumed, in an absolute and not a relative sense, to be
                        attributes of a Supreme Being who is all-just, all-truthful, all-merciful,
                        all-tender, rather than as mechanic or, if one accepts the created theory of
                        life, as an intelligently and yet not moralistically worked-out system of
                        minor arrangements, reciprocations and minute equations, which have little
                        to do with the aspects and movements of much larger forces of which as yet
                        we know nothing and which at first glance hinder rather than aid the
                        intellect in perceiving the ultimate possibilities of the governing force in
                        any direction. Indeed the rough balance or equation everywhere <pb
                            id="VAA2441-167" n="158"/> where seen and struck between element and
                        element, impulse and impulse, need and need, while they might seem to lend
                        color to the existence of absolute right, justice, truth, honor, etc.,
                        really indicates nothing more than this rough approximation to equation in
                        everythingforce with matter, element with elementas an offset to
                        incomprehensible and, to mortal mind, even horrible and ghastly extremes and
                        disorder; nothing more. For in the face of all the schemes and contrivances
                        whereby man may live in harmony with his neighbor there is the contrary fact
                        that all these schemes are constantly being interfered with by contrary
                        forces, decays, mistaken notions, dreams which produce inharmony. This can
                        mean nothing if not an inherent impulse in Nature that makes for change and
                        so rearrangement, regardless of any existing harmonies or balances, plus the
                        curious impulse in man and Nature (inertia?) which seems to wish to avoid
                        change.</p>
                    <p>In spite of all man&apos;s laws, taboos, social understandings,
                        agreements and beliefs, there are certain things done under the sun which do
                        not make for perpetual peace, harmony, order, exact justice and so the
                        welfare of the race <hi rend="i">as he conceives it;</hi> nor do they argue
                        for the domination of a harmonious, all-powerful God <hi rend="i">as man
                            conceives Him.</hi> Shocking as it may seem, certain individuals and
                        groups contrive to live and thrive under conditions which, according to
                        other masses and individuals who live and contemplate them, are apparently
                        inimical to the so-called best interests of the race and the plans of its
                        Creator. Indeed the latter is constantly, according to man or his theorists,
                        trying to overcome them and so save Himself.</p>
                    <p>Who and what are these inimical forces which are supposed to defy God
                        Himself? Criminals, liars, lechers, murderers, self-aggrandizing intellects
                        of all types and sizes, plus accident, disease, cataclysm. At the same time
                        and as if working in harmony with them, and to the dismay of the religionist
                        at least, there are vast legions of inimical non-moral and seemingly
                        socially non-helpful or even destructive microbes and <pb id="VAA2441-168"
                            n="159"/> animals which seize on man, the image of God, whose welfare
                        God seeks, and which live and thrive without sign of consciousness of God,
                        equation, or anything else. I am thinking of the germs of cholera, smallpox,
                        yellow fever, as well as plagues of locusts, worms, wood-lice or scales,
                        rats and the like, which while destroying vegetation and wealth most
                        necessary to man at one point at the same time may and do nourish birds
                        inimical or helpful to him and cause all things to develop methods of
                        defending themselves and so aid their growth. The chemic or mechanistic
                        interpreter of life discovers equation here well enough, and even a kind of
                        rough harmony, although the religionist does not, and so while it is
                        entirely possible for a monistic or evolutionary mystic to believe in a
                        series of individually severe but racially helpful checks and balances which
                        in some of their aspects are non-moral but are still driving man on to
                        something, good or ill, it is not possible for the religionist or the
                        moralist, taking him at his own dogmatic valuation, so to do. God must be
                        good, exactly just, always merciful, as man understands those things in the
                        realm in which he moves. Though a world of scientific data may now be
                        brought forward to demonstrate that God is not a personality with a given
                        moral direction or bias, as we understand morals, or with a here
                        decipherable purpose, yet he must deny that. The nature of God, if not
                        revealed by a voice of thunder from a mountain top, is, according to him,
                        seen in the works of Nature; and the works of Nature are good.</p>
                    <p>But if God, or Good, is imminent, working for some far-off, Divine event, why
                        the intermediate pother? I wonder at times why those who ponder these things
                        with a view of &quot;saving&quot; the race and so eventually
                        establishing truth, justice, mercy here on earth, are not permanently
                        confused or hushed into silence by the overwhelming evidence that no one
                        thing, however put together by the human brain to endure, succeeds
                        ultimately in maintaining itself or that which it dreams it will maintain.
                        Religions come and go. Laws are written and fade <pb id="VAA2441-169"
                            n="160"/> away. Moral laws change with groups and climates. There
                        remains only this necessity for equation, some form of adjustment,
                        reciprocity, balance between the integral factors of each group, good, bad
                        or indifferent, which no one thinks of translating as the <hi rend="i">only
                            omnipresent evidence of so-called Divine Will.</hi> Indeed, since it is
                        not necessarily directly connected with the welfare of the individual but is
                        something to which, willy-nilly, he must at least roughly adjust himself,
                        however successfully he may temporarily evade it, if he wishes to live, it
                        has come to be looked upon by him as the machinations of a devil who opposes
                        his God. In other words, dogmatic morals, as we understand these, have been
                        introduced, although these same, or our interpretation of what is essential
                        to the welfare of life, may not agree with the larger chemic urge and the
                        import of this compulsion of balance as Nature views or uses the same.</p>
                    <p>It follows, then, that many things which we now consider essential to our
                        racial or spiritual development, especially those which are intended to fit
                        us for a purely mythical heaven, may not be essential at all. Especially may
                        this be true of the many taboos and so-called moral social arrangements
                        which we have established here to make comfortable our little passing state
                        and which, by a process of egoism and self-interest, we ascribe to the will
                        of God. Asceticism in morals, as well as self-imposed deprivations of any
                        kind intended to bring us into conformity with the exact righteousness of
                        Nature or God, may have nothing to do with any Divine mandate or impulse
                        whatsoever. The investigations of the mechanists and the monists throw a
                        very disturbing light on Nature (Loeb; Crile; Snyder), Excess, we knowor its
                        equivalent, strainis destructive to any organism, and the dogmatic moralist
                        may well caution against it. Yet does a Creator who creates by billions and
                        allows whole races, such as the American Indians, for example, to disappear
                        almost in a generation, care particularly whether this, that or the other
                        organism is broken down <pb id="VAA2441-170" n="161"/> by this, that or the
                        other strain or excess? It may be that excess is entirely gratifying to Him
                        or Itlike a shell maker pleased with the explosive power of his shells. What
                        is one man, one organism, one race of organisms, to a thing that prouces
                        them by quintillions, age in and age out? So a conditioning law of equation
                        or balance which compels a rough reciprocity between parts, all parts, may
                        not remove the effects of or the necessity for strain or excess in the
                        relationship of some men or some races, or all men and all races. War
                        certainly indicates as much, and all the plottings and struggles and
                        injustices and deaths which are concomitants if not essentials of all forms
                        of progress. Again, what <hi rend="i">we</hi> might consider necessary in
                        the way of equation or balance, and what <hi rend="i">Nature</hi> would, are
                        two very different things. Our very finite minds can see but finitely. So
                        our seemingly necessary limitations on indiduals may be accidental and
                        trivial and so detrimental to the larger purposes of Nature, which must
                        betimes sweep them away with huge murderous wars or movements and so restore
                        the changeful balance which she must keep in ways different from the minor
                        arrangements which spring up here.</p>
                    <p>Even now Nature may be constructing individuals and forces which completely
                        undo, or at least enlarge, our theories of individual limitations and
                        powers. We do not as yet know what Nature is seeking through man, if
                        anythingcertainly not his immortality; there is no evidence as to thatnor
                        can we guess how she is seeking it. One thing we do know: our impulses do
                        not always accord with moral or religious law, the so-called will of the
                        Creator here on earth, and yet our impulses are assuredly provided us by a
                        Creator, if no more than the mechanistic one of the chemists and physicists.
                        We do not compound ourselves. We cannot always by any means control the
                        impulses of our compounds. Only the warring, frustrating impulses of other
                        compounds (or individuals or forces, social opinion being a phase of them)
                        do that for us; hence we are not privileged to say that God, or the Creator,
                            <pb id="VAA2441-171" n="162"/> wishes us to do thus and so. We can only
                        say that changing conditions compel us to or prevent us from doing thus and
                        so. Nature may wish us to be forceful in many strange ways in order that we
                        may contest, bicker with other things equally forceful in other ways (all
                        created by Her) so that out of the contest such as we see may come something
                        which we can never see. Who knows?</p>
                    <p>In other words, all we can say is that Nature has supplied us with certain
                        forces or chemic tendencies and responses, and has also provided (rather
                        roughly in certain instances) the checks and balances which govern the same.
                        Our puny strengths will permit us to do only so much; no more. That these
                        strengths are being enlarged from time to time is rather obvious (consider a
                        man like John D. Rockefeller, or Napoleon, and an ape). At the same time the
                        limitations essential to balance, reciprocity, part with part and force with
                        force, are apparently never set aside entirely. Both Rockefeller and
                        Napoleon find themselves decidedly limited in their powers, compelled to
                        compromise with many things in moving to attain their dreams. And their
                        wishes in the main have far transcended the dictates of ethics, as these
                        have hitherto been conceived. For the most part they ignored reported or
                        written ethics, sticking by seemingly unethical forces, subtlety, craft, the
                        power to do all that their strength or their instincts permitted them to do.
                        And Nature appears to have no objection to them or their results, has
                        furthered them indeed, nor has She apparently to millions of creatures like
                        them in spirit, or worse, as we see <hi rend="i">worse</hi> here, for She
                        permits their appearance and uses the result.</p>
                    <p>Let me vary the argument slightly.</p>
                    <p>The shelves of our law libraries are packed to suffocation and moldering to
                        decay with laws ethically intended govern things which man has never yet
                        been able to govern entirely and probably never will be, although the
                        instinct so legislate probably conforms to the mechanistic instinct for <pb
                            id="VAA2441-172" n="163"/> balance and proportion in all things. In
                        England they hung men for sheep-stealing a few hundred years ago, and yet
                        sheep were and still are stolen in England. It is death to kill your
                        neighbor, and yet when did man ever cease killing his neighbor? Is it not as
                        often and as indifferently done to-day as ever? It means from one to twenty
                        years in the penitentiary in America to steal, and yet men steal. It is
                        written that one should never covet his neighbor&apos;s wife and that
                        adultery is a crime, yet when has the ultimate conception of these things
                        been more than a dream? Man, or at least a part of him, a fragment of the
                        chemical whole of which he is a part or an expression, wishes and writes
                        laws to confirm these, but in spite of all so-called spiritual instruction,
                        an ordered scheme of spiritual rewards and punishments, he is still not
                        chemically able to accommodate himself to these thingsnot all of him, at
                        least. Nature, his sheer, rank human nature, which sinks deep below into
                        mechanistic, chemical and physical laws and substances, will not let him.
                        Instead he resorts to subtlety, crafta very unspiritual but plainly natural
                        or chemical thing. The fact is that the power of certain individuals to do
                        is only limited by the power of certain other individuals to resist, and
                        their natures and tendencies are by no means the same. Yet this squares with
                        the first or pyknotic law of energy, as laid down by Vogt.<ref id="ref_001"

                    <p>I once talked with a discouraged, or let us say pessimistic, humanitarian,
                        the twenty best years of whose life had been devoted to corrective and
                        ameliorative work among dependents and defectives, young and old, criminals,
                        the physically undermined and the insane. This man had worked to have

                            Simplified Conception of Substance.&quot;</note>
                        <pb id="VAA2441-173" n="164"/> laws passed in various States which would
                        tend to lessen the brutality of their treatment and also to bring about some
                        method whereby their self-reproduction would be painlessly stopped. His
                        idea, after twenty years of experimenting, was that the processes by which
                        the criminal and defectives generally were being gathered and governed and
                        improved, however laudable in theory, was destined to eventually prove
                        economically impossible and so shirked. The tares were too many, too
                        elusive, too expensive to gather and govern. &quot;The thing
                        can&apos;t be done,&quot; I remember his saying. &quot;As
                        society is at present governed or constituted something which is by no means
                        humanitarian or ideal prevails and in spite of the best intentions of
                        idealists or philanthropists you have the enormous toll of inefficiency and
                        nepotism to contend with. Always the old Adam breaks loose somewhere, and by
                        the time you have investigated and reinvestigated and built institutions and
                        passed laws and elected officials the thing becomes a social and financial
                        burden beyond reckoninglost,&quot; he added, &quot;in abstrusities
                        and bad management. Politicians juggle with it, and newer reformers or
                        reactionaries undo what you have done. Besides,&quot; he concluded,
                        &quot;normal, healthy men and women do not appear to be able to concern
                        themselves with the day-to-day variations and aberrations of dependent
                        defectives and criminal types. You have the spectacle then of official and
                        even medical neglect, brutality, rotten meat being served to criminals or
                        those detained or cared forin short, all the horrors that spring from some
                        curious opposition in Nature to anything which is not able to take care of
                        itself. Her plan apparently is to let them die. I tell you that the law of
                        the survival of the strongest cannot be set aside. Any attempt to do so
                        merely begets a vast tangle of effort and expense which results in the final
                        operation of that law anyhow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>My own observations of the working of various plans and theories calculated
                        to improve or &quot;save&quot; mankind coincide with this and
                        suggest to me the conclusion that there is, on the one <pb id="VAA2441-174"
                            n="165"/> hand, inherent in the chemic impulses and appetites of life
                        (which man does not create), an instinct toward individuality which may be
                        for good or for ill, plus, on the other hand, this law of balance or
                        equation but over which neither the humanitarian nor the idealist, any more
                        than the criminal or indifferent or self-seeking realist, has any control
                        whatever. If this were not true there would be no explaining such strange
                        social developments as the lusts of certain individuals, the vast animal
                        hungers and abnormalities which seem to contradict any possibility of an
                        exact social equation. While the ascetic passions and self-sacrifice of such
                        men as St. Francis, Jesus, Buddha and the like may belie an entirely
                        material or animal interpretation of this very material scene, the more
                        material one of an Alexander VI., a Medici, a Morgan and a Gould do suggest
                        that an equation or balance between the types is holding in Nature. Men do
                        fight and die for idealistic or moral beliefs just as plainly as they do for
                        material ends. This would indicate, as I said before, a desire for rough
                        balance or equilibrium in Nature between the starkest extremes of its
                        creative impulsesequation, equation. Nothing more nor less. But a God
                        directing and calling?</p>
                    <p>Oh, no; not that necessarily, but a condition in Nature itself perhaps which
                        will not permit it to move save by a process of checks and balancesvariety
                        in unity, and vice versa.</p>
                    <p>If one takes no more varied types than Christ and Nero, or Alexander VI. and
                        St. Francis, one sees how plain this is, in so far as our earthly state is
                        concerned. God, or Nature, or Life, permits both, creates both. In these
                        examples one sees how the impulses of the flesh always vary and how
                        difficult it is, where millions outrival these in secret tendencies and
                        impulses, to suggest a working harmony; and yet there is a harmony and they
                        do harmonize, or, by triturating the one the other maintain a working
                        balance, the tendencies of the one being offset by those of the other, and
                        vice versa.</p>
                    <p>No less latitude, perhaps, could or would serve in a world <pb
                            id="VAA2441-175" n="166"/> or a universe which breeds individuals by
                        quadrillions, momentarily perhaps, and which conceals or contains forces of
                        whose impulses, emotions, necessities we know nothing, and so equation is
                        and can be the only answer. What can we know, for instance, of the impulses
                        or morals of the Sun, whose heat apparently breeds all forms of life we know
                        here, horrific and otherwise? And yet we also know that heat is balanced by
                        cold in the universe; light by no light; matter by force; tenderness by
                        savagery; lust by asceticism; love by hate; and so on <hi rend="i">ad
                            infinitum.</hi> No thing is fixed. All tendencies are permitted
                        apparently. Only a balance is maintained.</p>
                    <p>The thing which the evolutionist has discovered and put forward with
                        considerable enthusiasm is this: that life in every form has tended to
                        evolve from the simple to the complex, and only through a vast complexity or
                        organization has it managed to attain this spectacle of things which we call
                        life or beautydivision of itself, as it were. The complexity of the
                        individual thing which we call a tree or a flower or an animal, or, if you
                        please, a social state (and indeed those more or less abstruse things which
                        we know as arts and sciences), are but a further evolution of the complexity
                        of the world machine, and life has brought them about and apparently saved
                        them to the world, possibly for the purpose of partial self-expression. At
                        the same time there has always been involved in this process the law of the
                        survival of the strongest or temporarily and accidentally most favored, a
                        process which the humanitarians are never prone to accept because it belies
                        the theory of saving anything except by a compensative condition of
                        slaughter and neglect of other things less strongor, as the phrase has it,
                        unfit things. In the theory of the religionist and the moralist the horrific
                        processes that work in the sea and the jungle, and other unsocialized and
                        enigmatic phases of imminent life, are entirely outside the scheme of a just
                        and merciful God or Creator, not countenanced by Him! When His will is known
                        and His suggestions are obeyed, these will <pb id="VAA2441-176" n="167"/> be
                        overcome and disappear! Well, this may be true, only it does not appear from
                        any material or mental examination of the scene.</p>
                    <p>Even now, as we talk of sweeter and less avid processes which might be
                        brought into play by a superior power, life is maintaining its ancient
                        balance of evil and good, or extremities of one kind balanced against
                        extremities of another. Even now, under the very noses of the religionists
                        and the moralists, these processes are at work and show no sign of being
                        abated. For every neighborhood of taste and comfort, witness the vast areas
                        of poverty, poor taste, neglect, dull thought, inefficiency. For every
                        comfortable man a lean one, or many. For every mind of the first order a
                        million of a weaker, fumbling character. For every tender, Christ-like soul
                        how many of another kindavid, selfish, cruel, hideous almost! Are the poor
                        governed by the richand well? Do the shrewd rule the ignorant, and to their
                        advantage? Do the strong control the weak, and to their advantage? Are the
                        inefficient well or badly housed, well or badly nourished, neglected, left
                        to stew in their own juice of misery and live and die as best they can, or
                        are they looked after, as the religionist and moralist suggest and hope for?
                        Only the dull or dishonest among the moralists and religionists can, it
                        seems to me, fail to perceive or dare deny what even the dull or the
                        ignorant now being trampled upon do already vaguely perceive and
                        understand.</p>
                    <p>And yet behold! the song of ultimate perfection continues yearly, from
                        century to century, to be sung. The Divine, far-off event (which, if
                        anything, is Nirvana) is surely coming. A sweeter and less avid process will
                        be brought into play. Man is to be saved from hunger, cold, thirst, lust,
                        undue material ambition, by telling him how horrible they are and asking him
                        to be kind. Well, he may make a comfortable social organization for himself
                        here on earth, but that will by no means prove that the universe or God is
                        moral. For, beholdman himself is superimposed upon other forms of life, a
                        ruthless Lord or <pb id="VAA2441-177" n="168"/> devil to them, and thrives
                        only by their destruction. Do you suppose the ox, the hog, the horse, the
                        fish, or any of the multitude of creatures man slays or enslaves in order
                        that he may be comfortable and spiritually at rest, could be made to look
                        upon him as tender, merciful, a creature necessarily to be saved to a higher
                        spiritual staterepresenting, for instance, an all-kind God? I doubt it. What
                        about the God who allows their organization and so-called right to life to
                        be disrupted in our favor? Where the universal harmony, justice, mercy
                        there? We are to develop a social organization in which gentleness, mercy
                        and harmony will prevail among us, but we do not hesitate to curb the
                        efforts or aspirations of lesser creatures, even rival nationsthe Indians,
                        sayin the same direction. In the great days to come no man will contest with
                        his neighbor, but only with the universewhich of course raises the question
                        of why fight the universe. And where do the rights of the universe come in,
                        which we are hoping to rob to our own advantage and its enslavement?</p>
                    <p>Aside from the confusion involved as to the character of man and the
                        governing forces of life, there is no quarrel with a portion of this theory.
                        To a certain extent harmony, or a &quot;dependent equation,&quot; as
                        Spencer was pleased to term it, will always be attained between individuals
                        assembled in vast numbers on earth or in the sea perforce, because it may
                        not be escaped. If one reads chemistry and physics correctly it is a
                        condition which underlies everything. An equation between matter and force
                        and the elements to which apparently they give rise, must be struck, a
                        balance attained, if life as we see it is to appear or go on. The slightest
                        disturbance of the existing equations which produce life as we see it, as
                        Loeb and Crile and others have shown, ends in monstrosities or confusion,
                        and life as we know it ceases. In our own social life, if equation did not
                        hold, internecine contest would soon decimate and gradually eliminate the
                        vast majority of us. The late great war indicated as much. Indeed there is
                        scarcely any doubt <pb id="VAA2441-178" n="169"/> that social life as we
                        know it will yet need to be organized upon an even more closely balanced
                        scale than at present, since the elements and powers which make for contest
                        and self-defense are becoming more numerous. Hunger, cold, thirst and many
                        other ills to which the flesh is heir may yet be eliminated among men, or
                        the individuals of one dominant state. It is now, by certain orders of men
                        and insects; the bee-hive and the ant-colony offer suggestions. But it does
                        not follow that the basic elements of Nature or God, or man, would thereby
                        be changed. Is it not more likely that here and now, in a small way and for
                        the time being, only their disruptive as opposed to their constructive
                        characteristics are restrained? Such stabilized centers of motion do occur
                        in Nature from time to time in small ways and places. All human and animal
                        bodies, machines and forms of government even, are illustrations in point.
                        But does that prove or augur that the changeful elemental conditions
                        everywhere prevailing outside these delicate arrangements in Nature may not
                        eventually sweep in and make over that which has been established here into
                        such a condition as we find in the sea, for instance, where life insistently
                        and apparently mechanistically preys on life? Why not? The glory of pagan
                        life and artwere they saved? Or was their knell sounded by the advent of
                        Christianity?</p>
                    <p>Many, observing only the satisfactory results of harmony or equation or
                        balance, and entirely failing to note the essential disharmonies out of
                        which alone harmonies may take their rise, have assumed the existence of an
                        emasculate God whose virtues are all negative, ignoring the positive horrors
                        by which we live and progress. For them the cataclysms of physics, the
                        fumbling failures of biology, are meaningless, if they exist at all. Yet
                        plainly the creative force is neither as generous nor as amiable as they
                        think. Rather, brilliant as is all this evolutionary process, and it reveals
                        startling harmonies, beauties and seeming intelligence, it still only argues
                        some such fumbling hit-or-miss mechanistic scheme as the chemists and <pb
                            id="VAA2441-179" n="170"/> physicists are beginning to outline and which
                        allows for far more latitude in morals and conduct, as well as invention and
                        discovery even, than the religionist has hitherto been willing to grant. The
                        only one who appears to sense the true process or processes of Nature is the
                        mechanistic chemist or physicist, who does not deny the possibility of
                        extremes and horrors existing in the Divine mind or will of the creative
                        impulse. &quot;Murder,&quot; say these scientific seekers after
                        truth, or at least their facts point to this, &quot;is a disturbing and
                        disrupting process. It destroys the equation best expressed in
                        &apos;Live and let live.&apos; It affects individual peace. If you
                        do so unto others they will do the same unto you. Chemically and physically,
                        according to the law of reaction or equation, they cannot very well avoid
                        it. Therefore do not murder.&quot; Yet where is there any Divine command
                        in that? Is it not rather a simple and easily understandable interpretation
                        of a very obvious and inescapable law of equation, under which nevertheless,
                        so roughly is this law adjusted and so casually does it work, murder and
                        many other forms of non-equation may and do take their rise and do persist?
                        If that is God or Good, then God permits murder, repays with murder, or asks
                        you to be the judge as to whether you will tolerate murder in your State.
                        Rather, to the physicist and chemist, it appears to be not so much a Divine
                        command as an accidental and inescapable condition of equation.</p>
                    <p>We are told, by way of dogmatic moral comfort, that man has achieved somewhat
                        that the animals have not, and that therefore he is superior. But also, as
                        is now becoming perfectly plain, he has been able to discover and perpetuate
                        for his own satisfaction crimes and iniquities for which no animal
                        apparently within its small range of instinct or mechanistic control has the
                        skill. Nature makes both, yet she does not, or cannot, or at least has not,
                        made the animals as delicately and resourcefully evil in some things as is
                        man. That is why he is able to dominate them. In one way, then, man is worse
                        than the animals, and in another bettera balance presumably in <pb
                            id="VAA2441-180" n="171"/> the favor of man, though not necessarily so.
                        The truth is that most of the ways wherein man has been differentiated from
                        the animals by forces over which he has no control concern not ethics, as we
                        understand and act upon them, but mechanical articulations and utilitarian
                        comforts, the construction and normal use of which lie entirely apart from
                        the realm of ethics. There is nothing either moral or immoral in the
                        development and use or non-use of steam, electricity, plumbing, the tractor
                        engine, automobiles and so on. They are mechanistic and non-moral. Thus we
                        have developed architecture, machinery and the arts. It is true that in so
                        far as man himself is concerned these are helpful to him in his mass phase
                        and provide a larger freedom, which has resulted in a large experience,
                        hence intelligence or comprehension in every direction. Yet have they
                        improved his morals? Or lowered them? Who would say so? Yet perceiving this
                        development or change, and, more faintly, the need of balance and equation
                        which runs through all and underlies all, man has set about the task of
                        writing about it, framing the inescapable equational laws which all changes
                        suggest and compel into definite unbreakable commands from a definite God,
                        singing songs about Him, painting pictures of Him, and directing attention
                        to what man has ignorantly assumed to be a universal source of supply which
                        will or should permit the greatest possible number to live under some such
                        scheme of equation as is here suggested. Unfortunately this has not been
                        proved as yet, and at any rate it is not the same as the presumably provable
                        scheme of moral order which has been foisted upon man by the dull, designing
                        or poetically enthusiastic of all ages, and which involves the laying aside
                        of nearly every forceful, vigorous, natural, or human or pagan, attribute.
                        Quite the contrary.</p>
                    <p>In this connection I should like to reiterate that to the Christian and other
                        metaphysical idealists neither dishonesty nor vice nor any crime is
                        contemplated by God, and therefore should not exist, any more than any other
                        variation from that <pb id="VAA2441-181" n="172"/> perfect state, best
                        indicated perhaps by what the Ten Commandments forbid and the Beatitudes
                        imply. God does not will them. He personally resents and will punish their
                        appearance. The first part of this (i. e., that He does not will them) might
                        be accepted as true if the fact that he permits them, or at least that they
                            <hi rend="i">are</hi>, in spite of Him, not denied. But of course
                        religion, as all those who philosophically struggle with life now know or
                        should, is an abstraction, an ideal, whose dogmas can only in part be
                        approximated in life. For life, as we nearly all know by now or should, is a
                        shifty and evasive mechanism, chemic in part at least, and material and
                        inscrutable, with which the abstractions of the religionist have little if
                        anything in common. The best that religion and ethics have so far done is to
                        take credit for the inherent and necessary tendency to compromise which has
                        previously been indicated and which is manifested by all phases of natural
                        energy, as much by that shown in our body politic as anywhere else. Indeed,
                        the very best that religion can show is no better than that which life, or
                        Nature Herself, could and did long before any religion appeared, namely, a
                        rough equation, a balance struck; so that if a man had done a consciously
                        wrong thing in one place he was chemically or emotionally moved to do a
                        right thing in another, and if his actions were bad in one way it might be
                        that he was compelled by forces outside his control to counterbalance them
                        by good ones in another. All animal forms above those merely mechanistic or
                        tropic (those governed by tropisms of various kinds) appear to display most
                        of the virtues exercised by humansthe care of their young, for instance,
                        distress at their loss, loyalty, ability to organize and so observe group
                        laws; characteristics celebrated by man, where exercised by him, as virtues,
                        beatitudes and what not else. Yet these lower forms cannot possibly know of
                        religious or moral precepts in any revealed or instructed sense, via a
                        Messiah or Redeemer. Instincts or tropisms as developed and verified by
                        oppositions or aids (accidental or otherwise)once <pb id="VAA2441-182"
                            n="173"/> more the law of balance or equationappear to have been their
                        sole guides. Hence to the religionist and moralist, thus far at least, they
                        have been beyond the pale of ethical consideration, things almost beyond the
                        willing, and so beyond the care, of the Creator Himself. An especial
                        opponent of God or Good had to be devised in order to take care of them. And
                        yet are they not an excellent illustration of this same creative and
                        governing force in Nature which, while apparently seeking variety in unity,
                        is itself subject to a law of balance or harmony as well as one of
                        disharmony or change, and this without any evidence self-conscious on its
                        part? At least the investigations of the chemists and the physicists thus
                        far appear to indicate as much. &quot;Vengeance is mine&quot;
                        declared the old Hebraic Jahveh, and by that very assertion he admitted that
                        he did not expect to establish the abstractions of right, truth, justice and
                        mercy on earth but rather, since he could not, he would at least attempt to
                        strike a balance and would exact, in the form of pain or disaster, repayment
                        for things done in opposition to his code.</p>
                    <p>Well, that requires no Sinaitic command or religious law to make it true. It
                        is not a matter for great churches and confessionals and pence and
                        genuflectionsor is it? It is true, whether God or Moses or any one else ever
                        said so or not. It is a material and an economic fact as well as a chemic or
                        psychic law. If you wish to glorify God or Nature for that, well and good.
                        Your mood may be admirable or interesting, if not exactly necessary. But
                        certainly, whether one admits the existence of a self-willing Creator or
                        not, it is too much to say that man obtains exact justice or that an exact
                        return is made anywhere for energies expended, ideals struggled for,
                        efforts, good, bad or indifferent, made. We know that is not true. Nor is it
                        true that there is not a counter impulse to withhold it. There is. And men,
                        fellow-units in the great self-balancing cosmos, all too frequently reflect
                        that impulse. Man is no more essentially just than he is unjust. He is an
                        impulse, a will to <pb id="VAA2441-183" n="174"/> live, a sharply reflected
                        chemical and physical impulse in Nature, which acts or reacts as the nature
                        of other chemical and physical stimuli in immediate contact with him
                        suggests or compels, and which same may be by no means as moral as we think.
                        Man, as a representation of chemical and physical impulses coming from
                        somewhere, has an innate desire for power for extreme movement for himself;
                        but so have all other mechanical or physical representations of that
                        impulse. And it is but the balancing pressure of his fellows which keeps him
                        in position at or near a median line. If you examine him carefully you will
                        find that in the main he desires so-called &quot;justice&quot; for
                        himself only, a fair balance for himself, liberty for himself, or that which
                        is related to him via pleasure or profit, and so on <hi rend="i">ad
                            infinitum.</hi> At the same time he is a slave, a tool, a medium for
                        something, an intruded if not self-intruding, self-seeking insect, but
                        without power to control or fend against major impulses and powers. Still,
                        between man and man, tribe and tribe, nation and nation, there are these
                        necessary equations or balances plus their internal hopes or chemic
                        tendencies, each one for himself, to change and achieve; yet the same being
                        but roughly worked out; on the one hand to balance or equation in favor of
                        all the others, on the other hand to supremacy or extreme liberty of
                        movement for each. Where only failure is achieved there is either a lull,
                        temporary only, or a storm soon or late (revolution), or periods of horror
                        in which chaos rules, or peace in which nothing is achieved. The world is
                        sad over its inability to obtain freedom, great scope of emotion, for
                        itself, or gleeful because of its triumph in this direction. But all the
                        time it is struggling and maintaining but a rough and in the main brief
                        balance, part with part or unit with unit.</p>
                    <p>One might go on indefinitely contemplating other phases of this same
                        equational law, its relation to love of parents, love of country, love of
                        home, love of one&apos;s neighbor, love of this, love of that. Are not
                        all of these held up as duties, virtues, perfections even Sinaitic commands,
                        as in &quot;Honor thy father <pb id="VAA2441-184" n="175"/> and thy
                        mother,&quot; when as a matter of fact and inwardly we know that this is
                        a matter of equation or balance and cannot absolutely as a commandment from
                        on high exist where no reasonable return in kind is predicated. What, love a
                        shameless, brutal, unparental or non-filial father or mother, son or
                        daughter, in whom, let us say, exists not one redeeming trait or quality of
                        all that we consider essential to or characteristic of those states? It is
                        not chemically therefore not humanly possible. What is meant is that it is
                        not only possible but natural to make a reasonable return where affection,
                        kindness or care has been extended. Now while it is entirely conceivable
                        that one might love one who was cruel to oneself and generous to others, or
                        generous to oneself and cruel to others, who in some way or some one
                        direction fulfilled some phases of balance or equation, in however weak or
                        impossible a way, still one could not possibly love one who was in no wise
                        kind or generous to any one, a thing without reciprocal or balancing
                        relations in some direction. The law of balance or equation which governs in
                        all processes, even thought, will not permit it. There must be something
                        given in some way, directly or indirectly, before anything can be returned
                        or evolved, even in thought. And if one reverses the picture and attempts to
                        conceive of hating some one or thing equationally just, fair or balanced,
                        not attempting to take from any one or thing too much and not withholding
                        from any one or thing that which is equationally his, it is quite as
                        psychically impossible. One cannot cerebrate inimically toward that person
                        or thing as being evil, reprehensible or what not. It cannot be done.
                        Sometimes, where by reason of plenty or inherent weakness of mind or force,
                        or carelessness of thought or interest, an individual is in any way
                        indifferent to a &quot;reasonable&quot; or balanced return to
                        himself for effort made, labor given, thought expended and what not, and
                        where this results in no injury to himself or others, it is entirely
                        possible to look upon him with indifference or as a fool, or as one who is
                        weak-minded or not capable of <pb id="VAA2441-185" n="176"/> balancing
                        himself against the shrewd and self-interested minds of others. But such
                        indifference or lack of self-interest would not indicate that one looked
                        upon him as being evil, scarcely even a discreditable force, save possibly
                        where his operations, or lack of them, affected the interests or rights or
                        privileges of another or others.</p>
                    <p>Not love of God, then, it would seem, nor fear of God, although these
                        abstractions have come to be real enough to some minds, prevents one
                        individual from overriding the dreams and hopes of his neighbor, but fear of
                        retaliation which his selfishness might produce. &quot;Thou shalt
                        not&quot; springs plainly from &quot;Thou hadst best not, it is
                        dangerous,&quot; to which might be added the strangest quality of all,
                        the tendency in large or small bodies or masses to quiescence, the love of
                        peace, or inertia. Our evoluted mechanistic chemism has become so diffused
                        or varied that we may even now speak of such intangible and yet vital forces
                        as love of the fixed scene, which appears to be little more than a reflected
                        form of helio, or ego, or some-other form of tropism, the inherent power in
                        everything to attract something to itself and so maintain itself, for the
                        time being anyhow. That things are inclined to a static or inert state or to
                        congeal and so stratify and endure in that form (Nirvana?) is as true as
                        that they must change; and, under certain conditions, Nature seems to abhor
                        too much speed, as too little.</p>
                    <p>Is there anywhere in this to be found that universal right, truth, justice,
                        mercy, as we have hitherto deemed it or them to be or exist? Perhaps not,
                        but it is all of so-called right, truth, mercy or justice, universal or
                        otherwise, that we will ever know, all of it that is involved with life.
                        Does this, by any chance, contain truth? Yes, indeed, it is truth, for it is
                        a fact. Is it right? Well, for life as we find it conditioned it is
                        apparently the only way. Who can suggest a better? Should the fact that we
                        find ourselves thus conditioned, confronted by Nature in all Her complexity
                        and with <pb id="VAA2441-186" n="177"/> only this necessity for equation to
                        fall back on, disconcert or dishearten us? Need it or must it take the savor
                        out of life? No; not, at least, in my judgment. Life in its most terrible as
                        well as its most halcyon aspects is at once an enticing and a fit game. It
                        seems well enough suited to our capacities, and we to it, since essentially
                        we are of itit, in fact. At least it leaves or provides us much to strive
                        for, and strife is the only key to knowledge or sensation and life that we
                        have. Abstractions and theories are good as games at which the human mind
                        may play if it chooses, and whenever life becomes too severe for any group
                        or part of it it is easy enough to invent a theory or abstraction which will
                        then make it seem different. And this is almost invariably done, as witness
                        all the impossible religions and theories that at one time and another have
                        filled the world. Like chess or checkers, they furnish a diversion or relief
                        to life-weary minds. If you have nothing better to do even a religion may be
                        worth while. At worst it can only narrow your vision, and if that is a
                        comfortwell, it is a comfort, but you do not thus escape the essential facts
                        of life. You merely invent a shield against their too-sharp blows.
                        Regardless of whatever dogmatic moralities may have been dreamed, or yet may
                        be, or attempted, life is still avid, treacherous, astounding. Our little
                        safety, if we have any, lies not in the desires or intentions of our
                        fellow-mortals, good, bad or indifferent, or in their churches or creeds, or
                        ours really, but in their limitations. <hi rend="i">They dare not do unto us
                            for fear of what we will do to them, or of what the machinery of
                            equation which life has set up or is conditioned by and now operates,
                            will do to them</hi>. All else is a poet&apos;s dream.</p>
                    <p>What, then, shall man do? Weep for that? Shall he despair and call life a
                        failure and a torment? Shall he say that it is limited, that there is no
                        opportunity for progress, or that the sweetness of those things defined as
                        love, charity, mercy, neighborliness and race sociability are by such a
                        governing condition destroyed? Not at all. Wherein is the temperament of
                        Nature <pb id="VAA2441-187" n="178"/> Herself, Her sweetness, if such there
                        be; Her romance, if such there be; Her beauty, if such there be, altered by
                        this? Life is as it isactive, dancing, changeful, beautiful, at once brutal
                        and tenderregardless of how our theories would seek to make it seem, and
                        though it does as it chooses at times, or appears to, and invents or assumes
                        various guises of perfection, it is as it has always been, both good and
                        bad, yet held in a kind of equational vise or harmonyneither too good nor
                        too bador we would not now be here at all, any of us, to tell the tale. As
                        it is, and well within its equational swing or law, there is room for the
                        will to superiority in the super-man as well as the trembling fears of the
                        least of created creatures. Nor is it impossible for man, with his puny
                        strength or with such force as he may gather, to attempt to upset this very
                        equation and so rule all: or, on the contrary, choose to live in sweetest
                        peace with his neighbor, if he can. He may, and great will be the wonder and
                        charm of his existence if he no more than try. But that he should succeed in
                        permanently so doing is not within his scope unless he should grow to be the
                        universe itself. On the other hand, under this same controlling equation, a
                        man may be a Colossus and bestride the world without upsetting the equation
                        ultimately. Like Alexander, he may sigh for more worlds to conquer; or, like
                        Hannibal, take refuge in despair and death. Or, better yet, like some
                        forceful and yet humble laborer at some small task, he may seek to hide
                        himself away in some simple peaceful realm, free of the storms which rock
                        these greater worlds, and still be secure in one of those minor equilibriums
                        which in the shadow of some of the greater ones are always holding somewhere
                        in part. For, roughly, equation is always holding in one or many
                        formsdependent equations, which consist of many, many equations or balances,
                        joined in some still greater one or synthesisand apparently always will. Who
                        shall say? To our present senses the ultimate <pb id="VAA2441-188" n="179"/>
                        facts of life are not altering; although that is not for petty man to
                        know.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, I should say that the condition of equation which is
                        everywhere evident does not deny or belie any elements of softness, color,
                        beauty or art which now sweeten, or seem, to, a picture which must seem to
                        many inherently grim. God, Good, Nature, Force, is not now, and never has
                        been apparently, without some of these aspects in part, nor bare of the
                        easing limitations indicated by the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule and
                        the Beatitudes. For before these were <hi rend="i">it</hi> was, and if they
                        are or ever were true they still are so, for they took their rise out of it
                        and so must be and remain in it, forever and ever, emanations or adjustments
                        (equation, no doubt) suggested by the desire for expression on the part of
                        the cosmos as a whole. Yet the knowledge that they are the result of a
                        condition or equation which the universe, the life force itself, cannot
                        escape, is or should be most encouraging. Nature must let many things live
                        in reasonable equation or peace, for it is in them and they in it.
                        &quot;I am in the Father; the Father is in me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>If, then, man is savage he is also tender, inherently so apparently, for by
                        what measure would he measure savageness if not by its contrary? And if he
                        is avid, centripetal, individual, is he not somewhat of their contrary also?
                        In truth, somewhere in the scheme of things is implanted a love of beauty
                        and order as well as their contraries, which can only find expression via
                        equation, and this it is, chemical, inherent awareness of it no doubt, which
                        eases the ache of existence for us all (God, man, devil). For if life loves
                        change, movement, difference, contest, it also plainly loves their
                        contraries, for these exist, and we could not know the one without the
                        other. Order exists as a half of its opposite, disorder, and the one could
                        not well be without the other, and peace exists, if at all, as the
                        complement or antithesis of what is not peaceful. Yet through all and all,
                        and in all and all, are the sting and gayety of <pb id="VAA2441-189" n="180"
                        /> change and the consciousness of it, and these remain, possibly forever
                        and ever, outside Nirvana, which Nature may never wish to see or know. It
                        may be impossible for Her to die or be still.</p>
                    <p>Equation, then, is that which is involved in the lust of the lover for his
                        sweetheart, and her acceptance; the husband for his wife, and her faith; the
                        mother for her child, and its love; the citizen for his neighbor; the
                        individual for his friend. Art, the love of life for itself, is nothing more
                        than a synthesis of many equations whereby many lovely harmonies and their
                        opposites are expressed or implied. Hunger, balanced against satiation,
                        creates more beauty. Life builds and wills far beyond the ken of man or his
                        companion animals, and all that he can know is the chemic thrill of life,
                        its joys, the necessity of equation and so-called fair play, or rhythm and
                        balance. For, behold, life is ever dancing and does not will to be still.
                        Not to want too much, because one cannot get too much; not to seek to devour
                        the whole world, because one cannot; not to threaten, because of vanity and
                        self-appreciation, all else with extermination, because one cannot possibly
                        exterminate all else without disturbing the general balance and so bring the
                        weight, the conditioning and crushing force of equation itself upon oneself,
                        is to say what may offend the individual life-lover but which nevertheless
                        produces the only condition in which the general totality in all its
                        glittering variety, which it appears to crave, can best express itself
                        outside Nirvana. And this it is which should drive the fog of religious
                        theory out of our minds.</p>
                    <p>For why pray in beggarly fashion for that which will be, whether we pray or
                        notwhich, as the mechanists believe and show cannot escape its own destiny?
                        Rather sing and be joyful. I should say, for one&apos;s unescapable
                        share in so great a spectacle. The game is open, free, a thrashing, glorious
                        scene. Our God, if we have one, is not a namby-pamby, milk-and-water
                        solution, suitable for the stomachs and optics of still more namby-pamby
                        men, but a vast somewhat which offers a splendid <pb id="VAA2441-190"
                            n="181"/> universe-eating career to the giant, if he wills, an
                        opportunity to thrive and grow to even the most spindling of beginners. Our
                        God, if we have one, is a vast somewhat too great for the perception or
                        understanding or destruction or solution of any minor portion of Him, such
                        as we are. He is a creator of spectacles, a slinger of thunder-bolts, a
                        breather of fire, a master of cataclysm. His, or Its, least breath is storm.
                        Its sigh is earthquake or orbital derangement. No attributes such as man can
                        conceive can applyneither good nor evil, virtue or its oppositefor these
                        apply only as mild suggestions at moments of equation in one minor part of
                        the great whole or another. Our God is tragedy and comedy, terror and
                        delight. He is limitless opportunity and endless opposition and destruction,
                        for His way is extremes in equation, and nothing more and nothing less.</p>
                    <p>What then? Despair over that? Is there not, in all conscience, under a loose
                        equation (loose and operative only in extremes) room for all the lusts, the
                        terrors, the wonders, the simplicities of the greatest as well as the least?
                        Alexander may yet be again, or the devil himself in all his power and lurid
                        glory, before he is crushed and set aside, for the time being, by his
                        inherent antithesis, the thing which is not devil.</p>
                    <p>And as for the religionist, may not Jesus, St. Francis, St. Simon Stylites
                        come again? Let man fight for their return if he will. Who is to gainsay
                        him?not God, Force, the Universal Substance. Obviously it does not care how
                        it expresses itself, so long as it achieves avid, forceful, artistic
                        expression.</p>

                                illimitable and indescribable splendor, the colorings of the dawn.
                                Beyond, a swirling belt of suns and satellites glittering thinly
                                against the dark. Beyond this, in measureless nothingness, the
                                suggestion of other clouds of suns and planets, spinning. At the
                                center, the Presence, couched upon gold and porphyry, high-piled,
                                cloud on cloud. Poles of outpouring thought, great flames, radiate
                                from his brows; about him a nimbus of fire. He is now fully
                                self-materialized and concentrated, but sits quiescent, weary,
                                lonely, a compendium of vagrom, changeful, insane emotions and
                                ideas. Immediately before him</hi>, BEAUTY, LOVE, PITY, HOPE,

                    <head>ASHTORETH</head>
                    <p>WHAT has impressed me most about life, always, is the freshness and newness
                        of everything, the perennial up-welling of life in every form; the manner in
                        which, as age steals on for some, youth, new, innocent, inexperienced,
                        believing, takes charge, its eyes alight with aspiration, its body ablaze
                        with desire. We know that the world is old, old, and societies also in every
                        form, while the average span of life for the individual is little more than
                        forty yearsyet step into the streets and witness the immemorable clangor and
                        newness, the present visible portion of the unbroken thread or pattern that
                        reaches back into eternity. And for all that life is so old, old, and atoms
                        of the life pattern or chain are feeble, is life old? Does the bit of thread
                        or pattern that we see here now show the least evidence of wear or tear? Is
                        not the race as new, as fresh as ever? We rise betimes and the ancient
                        sunlight streams fresh and strong and <hi rend="i">new</hi> into our passing
                        window this window which, in a few years, will be as forgotten and as
                        non-recoverable as we ourselves shall be.</p>
                    <p>And the ways withoutare they crowded with the aged, the worn, the soul-weary?
                        Here and there, perhaps, a halting, bent or time-worn specimen that attracts
                        attention for its <hi rend="i">age!</hi> In the main, at every turn, youth
                        is in charge, laughing, singing, whistling, the newest modes of the <hi
                            rend="i">Zeitgeist</hi> adorning it, the latest coats, the latest hats,
                        the latest shoes heightening the charm of bodies utterly evanescent. The
                        percentage of the really aged abroad is as one to one hundredone thousand.
                        Viewing the swift tides of life as they burble in the great thoroughfares
                        they are utterly negligible. And it is always so. A large crowd of the old
                        and the weak and the defective <pb id="VAA2441-211" n="202"/> would be an
                        astounding sight anywhere in life that is so old.</p>
                    <p>Yes, life is careful to do away with all evidences of age in the public
                        places where it runs so gaily. The sickare they here or in hospitals or
                        darkened bedrooms? The maimed, the blind, the defective in any wayare they
                        here, or hidden away in institutions where the young and the hopeful may not
                        see? Life apparently resents them. It will not have its ways bestrewn by its
                        discarded implements and shells. Out, out, since it is done with them. Away!
                        There is much talk of charity and the beatitudes, but let one lose an arm, a
                        leg, an eye, a hand. Practically the entire world shudders and withdraws.
                        Better, indeed, a criminal, whole and exhibiting that self-sufficiency which
                        the life impulse demands, than to have been injured in any worthy or even
                        glorious contest Rarely if ever, and never willingly, does Life obtrude upon
                        our unwilling gaze a suggestion of the brevity of our own strength or charm,
                        or present to the eye even a faint suggestion of the inscrutable and
                        astounding and even wholesale cruelty of itself. Indeed, where Nature with
                        her illusions has her way, pain weariness and death are never to be accepted
                        as the huge controlling facts that they are.</p>
                    <p>WhatNature cruel? Look at the freshness of Her face, the joy of Her perpetual
                        youth, the glory of Her springs, the richness and variety of Her facets and
                        changes! Quite so. She is the subtlest of all our enemies, the wisest of all
                        our craftsmen and managers. Her instinct and therefore Her business is to
                        keep the eternal freshness and durability and zest of life upper most, and
                        this She does with unbelievable skill. For although we are here, young and
                        new, believing vigorously in our destiny, the grand sum of our future and
                        its durability, still only forty or fifty years ago there were all of a
                        billion people here who were as fresh and as vigorous and as youthful as we
                        are now. They believed in their grand destinies as we believe in ours, and
                        where are they? Gone. No traceno memory evenno care. Only we are what is
                        left of what was them, their descendants. <pb id="VAA2441-212" n="203"/> And
                        the astonishing tragedies, the painful diseases, the most grinding and
                        wearing of denied hopes, by reason of which they are no longer here and we
                        arehow adroitly even the memory of these have been removed! The wonder! Yet
                            <hi rend="i">life</hi> is as fresh now as it was then. <hi rend="i"
                            >It</hi> has not aged. <hi rend="i">It</hi> has not gone. The endless
                        chain is as bright and strong as ever-stronger, maybe. To-morrow when we are
                        where they are it will be as taut and shining and swift-moving and as new as
                        ever.</p>
                    <p>But these young bustling souls swinging their canes, lighting their
                        cigarettes, whistling and dreaming of a perfect tomorrowdo they know aught
                        of this? Not a word. And will they? Not, in the main, until it is too late
                        to affect their lives. And, better yet, and what is really more important,
                        they do not care. Life has one admirable trait: it limits the sensibility of
                        many. &quot;Never mind, dearie,&quot; it seems to say, &quot;do
                        not worry about me, or older days. The old was nothing, the new is all. Eat,
                        drink, be merry and forget. It is best.&quot; Thus life, and it is her
                        intention that they shall. Each sorrow or deprivation or disaster as it
                        befalls them is painted in their consciousness as special to them. Never
                        before was there one such to equal this. No, no. Life would not be so cruel.
                        She would not intentionally do this to any one. &quot;What!&quot;
                        she whispers artfully and convincingly, &quot;life induce such bitter
                        tears? Life ruthlessly and cruelly deprive any one of a hand? an eye? of
                        life itself? Never. To be injured thus indifferently, when so many are not,
                        was never intended by her for you, as you can see. If that is not so, why is
                        it so many are well, hale, happy?&quot; So she lies, for well she knows
                        that each can know but a very little, has no time to learn more. And she
                        sees that he has not.</p>
                    <p>But in the dark places, the back rooms, the upper floors or cellars of
                        tenements or great houses, the hospitals, the asylums, the jails, the farms
                        and homes for the agedand the enormous graveyards! Look and see. Here are
                        those who but a little while since were a part of this pell-mell vigorous
                        scene. They were <pb id="VAA2441-213" n="204"/> her tools, as you are now,
                        her victims. She fashioned them as one might a small machine, used them for
                        a while for something and then threw them aside. Like a knife or any tool,
                        they grew a little dull, and it is so much easier to fashion a new one. We
                        are intended to last only a little while. While your strength is budding
                        that of others is failing. While your cheeks are reddening theirs are
                        paling. While your eyes are sharpening in shrewdness theirs are weakening to
                        a dim myopia, and you may soon out-see them and push them aside. Yet the
                        bodies of the old that so offend you now were as lithe as your own, and they
                        in their hour were grumbling at the ineffectiveness of age.</p>
                    <p>But the darkest part of it is that aside from the small modicum of service
                        which you may render at top speed and with the utmost enthusiasm. Nature has
                        not the slightest care for you or yours. With the same cavalier air with
                        which She provides a hundred drones for the single love-flight of the queen
                        bee, all the failures to die, so She provides a thousand, or ten thousand,
                        or a hundred thousand, that oneand only onemay think the necessary thought,
                        invent the necessary machine, build the necessary bridge or lead the
                        necessary army. The rest may die as they will. They are chaff. Lay them out
                        in hundredsin millionsto be blown whithersoever the wind listeth, to
                        poverty, to death, perchance even to fortune, a brief hour. Who cares? Not
                        She. Only the ways of life must be kept fresh and new, the illusion of
                        newness and vigor maintained. Only through new bright instruments will She
                        work, and none other. A tasteful maid. In the blood-stream of your body are
                        quadrillions of little entitiesso many millions to the single blood
                        dropwhose total destiny, apparently, is to your life about as yours is to
                        the raceand no more. They hurry that you may live. They toil that you may

                    <head>THE REFORMER</head>
                    <p>AMONG the interesting phenomena of life is the periodic appearance in every
                        walk of life of the reformer, the individual who, according to some theory
                        based on clear perception or some delusion that has developed in his brain,
                        seeks to readjust conditions as he finds them to something more in accord
                        with what is agreeable to him, and who accordingly, by a process of
                        transference akin to that which has been so adequately set forth in
                        psychoanalysis, seeks to represent himself to himself as a world need.
                        Always it is life, not himself, that is in need of this new condition, and
                        so him. And what is it that as a rule he offers or seeks? Without exception,
                        if you trouble to examine the great instancesBuddha, Christ, Confucius, St.
                        Francis, Luther, Mohammedit is a revision of a current, and in itself
                        passing, condition which has become irritating to his sense of balance or
                        proportion or equation in things mundane, his personal and physical reaction
                        to or sensory repulsion from conditions which have become chemically
                        (socially, spiritually, anything you will) too far removed from a norm or
                        mean or equation which appeals to him, his eternal and special view of
                        harmony. But this after all is chemic and natural, and when he is successful
                        he merely represents an inevitable tendency in nature to maintain a balance
                        or equation between one type of mood and another, only one of which can be
                        dominant for a time and of which he becomes the passing representative.</p>
                    <p>It is the only way apparently in which the moving spirit which creates us can
                        expressor, better yet, changeitself. Our self-propulsive emotions, moods or
                        appetites have somehow <pb id="VAA2441-216" n="207"/> a tendency, if
                        uninterrupted, to lead us too far in some one directionto the place, for
                        instance, where a chemical or physical non-balance is threatened to that
                        dependent equation of rival forces in which we all find ourselves immersed
                        or held. Then, apparently, by an inhering law which compels balance or
                        equation in all things, a counter-tendency which is most likely to first
                        present itself in the shape of a reformer, or instructor, or warner, always
                        chemical in his significance, appears (Buddha, Christ, Mohammed, Luther),
                        and you have a readjustment toward a happy medium again, as it were. One
                        phase of life, let us say, grows and presses too dominantly on another.
                        Forthwith a spokesman or mouthpiece of some kind arises, the antithesis of
                        the dominant thing, by no means remote or divine but plainly human and
                        simple and easily understandable, if he is to prove of any value. That is
                        why it is always esoterically safe in gross material days to look forward to
                        the coming of a Christ or Messiah, or reformer, or changer, of one type or
                        another. He is in reality a chemic and psychic sign. He cannot help coming.
                        He is merely an individual expression of the general tendency toward balance
                        or equation. And he will surely come when things swing too far in any given
                        direction. Any one can be a mouthpiece for an extreme lack of balance in
                        human affairs, any one. The accident of circumstances usually distinguishes
                        that one.</p>
                    <p>But by that we are not told that extremes, either of the gross or material,
                        or on the other hand of the spiritual or ascetic, are to be permanently done
                        away with or &quot;reformed,&quot; or that either, when dominant, is
                        essentially evil or good, or that the replacing thing is essentially better
                        and so should remain forever. Rather, what is new and ameliorativebe it
                        religious, ethic or economicis merely one or the other half or portion or
                        face of that which was before it came, a change from, or the obverse of, the
                        other. Indeed the essential character of God, or the biologic force, or the
                        Universe, is not made much clearer unless we see in this tendency to change
                        or equation in <pb id="VAA2441-217" n="208"/> all things that it or he is
                        both good and evil Since chemically or spiritually we are compelled always
                        to seek a level or balance and maintain it, roughly enough it is true; since
                        to live is to swing to and fro, past a mean and between extremes, may we not
                        deduce from that that equation, balance, is an attribute of God or the life
                        force, a conditioning attribute, and one under which it <hi rend="i"
                            >must</hi> express itself?</p>
                    <p>For in life, as we may always note, and at the very moment the greatest
                        reformers are operating, there are also working and quite as vigorously,
                        else the reformer would have little to doanti-reformers, or anti-Christs, or
                        reactionaries, if you will, creatures who represent the obverse of what is
                        sought by the reformer or changer, and who will by no means be permanently
                        disposed of by him. Life apparently goes on two legs, or opposites,
                        alwaysheat: cold; high: low; external: internal; strength: weakness; little:
                        much; excluded: included. Side by side with millions or billions who wish
                        one type of thing are always millions or billions who wish another, whose
                        impulses, desires and necessities are the very antithesis of those advocated
                        by the reformers, saviors, adjustors then operating. Thus as Christ walked
                        the earth there were Herod, and the whole brood of Roman, Greek and Egyptian
                        philosopherspagans allscouting his beliefs and dreams, and their descendants
                        are with us yet. About St. Francis were the millions of gour-mandizers and
                        lechers of France, Italy and the European world generally (to say nothing of
                        the skeptical Innocent III.) too gross to perceive the significance of that
                        which the saint represented. Yet St. Francis was little more than a chemical
                        reaction against a too-heavy materialism that enveloped Europenothing more,
                        truly. He was, as it were, poetry as opposed to the grossest and most sodden
                        type of materialistic thought. This is equally true of Luther and so many
                        others. Christ the same; Mohammed the same. Yet plainly the creative force
                        which we worship as God, the underlying chemistry with its cell mechanism,
                        was as much the maker of the fat sensualists who surrounded <pb
                            id="VAA2441-218" n="209"/> and enraged Luther as it was of Luther. It
                        was and is in both, and both in it. Else how explain their joint presence
                        and conflict, their psychic as well as chemic necessity to each other, the
                        one useless without the otherno devil no saint, and vice versa? I for one am
                        convinced that the Universe, or God, or Good, is no more concerned with our
                        saints than with our sinners. Both may be essential, no doubt are. Certainly
                        both are in it, from it, necessary to it, expressive of different moods of
                        it, and as such necessary to each other, in order that it or life shall
                        exist, express itself, at all. From this I see no escape by any path.</p>
                    <p>The great aim of all reformersthat of permanently reforming man in his social
                        as well as his religious ways or intentions, in his lusts after sensuality
                        and the like, from a (in their estimation) condition of too great license to
                        one of none at allis of course ridiculous. Although always
                        &quot;Justice,&quot; &quot;Right,&quot;
                        &quot;Truth,&quot; &quot;Eternal law&quot; are supposed to
                        be involved in their commandments or demands, and presumed to represent a
                        permanent and unchanging state of perfection of some kindthe all-good in
                        some direction, and as such to be the direct commandments of God Himselfwhat
                        is really, often unintelligently, sought is an easement of a too-great
                        social swing in any one direction. Not perfection, but a better balance, is
                        all that is really sought or ever attained. Yet so errant and nonsensical is
                        life, its social or chemic driftmere idle rocking of force in one direction
                        or another at times that man, for a time at least at one period or another,
                        may be made to believe in or at least conform to, even coincide with, some
                        current conception of the ideal which may or may not be in line with his
                        greatest need, equation, in his affairs here or elsewhere at the timewhich,
                        indeed, may be absolutely inimical to his mental progress, as in the case of
                        Mohammedanism, Shmtoism, Christianity and the like. In other words, the
                        necessity for obtaining a better equation in one place may very well upset a
                        very excellent equation elsewhere. Thus, <pb id="VAA2441-219" n="210"/>
                        while it might be of passing advantage in one countryArabia, saythat a
                        readjustment via the thoughts of a Mohammed would be in order, it does not
                        follow that his local &quot;Rights,&quot; &quot;Truths&quot;
                        and homilies would elsewhere be essential. Yet essential or no, an impetus
                        flowing from such a center may well disturb a better equation elsewhere.
                        This was illustrated when Mohammedanism assailed Christianity in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The truth is that what the reformers are always seeking, ignorantly or
                        otherwise, is a better balance in things social or mental or moral, less
                        accentuated tendencies of any kindusually away from the too-gross, although
                        at times away from the too-ascetic also, toward which extremes life appears
                        to swing at times. And what they do is to identify their meager, if
                        equational, perceptions of life with eternal thought or order, and to insist
                        that the half of the balance which they represent is the whole of it. As a
                        rule they are quite unfitted by ignorance as well as by the time mood of
                        which they are the expression to see that without that against which they
                        war neither they nor their divine creator would have the least excuse for
                        existing.</p>
                    <p>To me, not violent extremes of any kind, although these are productive of
                        great suffering at times, but the suave inanity which imagines it wants only
                        unchanging good or, on the other hand, unchanging evil, is the thing to be
                        feared. Fortunately or unfortunately, as one may view this thing, a strictly
                        median condition, while excellent as a haven of refuge from extremes, is
                        nevertheless never wholly or easily attained in life, and never, apparently,
                        seriously desired by it, as an end in itself, and never quite satisfactory.
                        Indeed it is the equivalent of nothingness and would produce just that if
                        the world sought to persist in it. Yet wise Nature is our rescuer in this as
                        in many another plight in which betimes She places us for ends of Her own,
                        for Nature seeks, if She seeks anything, motion, although apparently in no
                        straight line. Her mood, if anything, is synchronic, rhythmic, pendulumic.
                        She wishes, if one may <pb id="VAA2441-220" n="211"/> interpret Her wishes
                        from what may be seen here, to swing in a semi-balanced way between extremes
                        of so-called good and evilnever all good and never all evil, but a little of
                        both, or plenty, in order that there may be contention, strife, something to
                        live <hi rend="i">about</hi> and for. These violent extremes of any
                        kindascetic, religious, barbaric, or repulsivewhich affect life and irritate
                        our souls, or the souls of some of us, are not at all offensive to Nature in
                        Her entirety apparently. She appears to like extremes as well as a median
                        line, the latter as a fence or break between them, and will have nothing of
                        perpetual anything in any one direction. And life, it seems to me, would be
                        more understandable, less disturbing to most of us, if in hours of stress of
                        any kind we were able to realize thisthat Nature adores extremes, with
                        always a happy medium as the guiding and dividing line to which She can
                        return and on which She can fix, as the mariner on the North Star. And if
                        some such more liberal conception of God, or force, or life, or the creative
                        impulse, could be introduced, it would be better. What we really need is a
                        better stomach for life as it is, and Nature, in the course of time, may
                        possibly build us such.</p>

                            answers, were once submitted to me by an American publication for
                            comment or solution! At the time I was unable to make an intelligible
                            reply, but having since given the matter thought I have answered them,
                            largely for my own satisfaction. They are submitted with no faith in any
                            possible fixed solution but merely as meat for passing discussion.</hi>

                        <p>In the first place, are there so many evidences in favor of marriage as
                            we practice it? In part the question contains its own answer when it
                            states that so many marriages fall short of just the purpose they seem
                            meant to serve. Statistics for marriage and divorce show that one out of
                            every seven marriages ends in the divorce court. For every one thus
                            openly disrupted, how many others are restrained or concealed for
                            reasons of religion, morality, children, society and business Policy or
                            permitted license? Many a couple agree to go their ways separately,
                            doing as they please and shielding each other in their privileges.
                            Others drift into a quarrelsome or unhappy state from sheer inertia or
                            lack of means or charm or courage to establish or create a new
                            condition. Millions sink in the slough of despond because they have not
                            strength of any kind. Age poverty, thickness of wit does for them
                            completely.</p>
                        <p>Now there is no need, and should be no desire, to evade the biologic
                            necessity implied by marriage. Children must be brought into the world
                            and reared if life is to go on. All the why-fors of this are given in a
                            thousand biologic and anthropologic volumes, and so no need to discuss
                            them here. But this much may be said, that among animals the limits of
                            the control of the maternal feeling or instinct are rigidly confined to
                            simple necessity. Love seems to disappear as soon as the young can
                            possibly walk or fly and get their foodproof of its mechanistic or
                            chemic quality and origin and its lack of any sacrosanct and
                            &quot;for eternity&quot; spiritual character. Indeed, under most
                            phases of animal life the father is absolutely indifferent to the fate
                            of his offspring. In many, perhaps most, animals he seems to care no
                            more for his children than if they were moving bushes. Certainly he
                            cares no more for his own than for those of another, and the idea of any
                            love toward grandchildren is absurd. Not even the mother shows this.</p>
                        <p>But it is of the greatest interest to note that with the appearance of
                            humanity and its ideas of home and property (both, products of maternal
                            instinct or the chemic necessity in her <pb id="VAA2441-223" n="214"/>
                            for the care of her young) there has arisen a natural extension of the
                            scope and control of the family instinct, so that the interest of the
                            parents continues into or through adult life Support and protection of
                            the mother continues beyond the child-bearing period, grandchildren are
                            beloved, more distant, relatives are held within the family affection,
                            and the patriarchal type of society is established. Since the higher
                            ideals of society and civilization have been permitted to arise the
                            aegis of love has extended over the nation, and patriotism, with its
                            great influence in war and history, has appeared. Finally that highest
                            development of humanity, ethics or love of humanity, has arisen (still
                            an actual outgrowth and extension of maternal instinct or love
                            apparently), as well as the theory of the existence of a Divine
                            Father-Mother of humanity and of all life.</p>
                        <p>Yes, since the period of the law and the influence of Rome and the idea
                            of love, the practice of it by enduring families has become rapidly more
                            complex. To the force of sex compulsion and instinct, never omitted,
                            have been added permanency, monogamy, home-keeping virtues, pedagogy,
                            public health, civic and political honor, democracy and a thousand such
                            compounds. Has it stood up well under them? Is the load too great? Our
                            riotous divorce practices and statistics, as well as the so-called sex
                            or prostitution problem, raises a sharp question. Does the average
                            strong successful man confine himself to one woman? Has he ever? Does
                            the exceptionlly beautiful and dynamic woman confine herself to one man?
                            Has she ever? Has not fear frightened the weak into a kind of rat-like
                            dodging or a sniveling, quarreling, complaining compliance? It may be
                            and no doubt is true that the so-called &quot;building of the
                            future,&quot; contemplated by the mechanistic or biologic impulse,
                            if by anything, cannot be based on sensuality entirely; but the retort
                            may be that Nature never seems to desire or achieve a wholesale
                            debauchery any more than she desires a cold and narrow monogamythe
                            religionists and ethic-mongers to the contrary notwithstanding. At best
                            she <pb id="VAA2441-224" n="215"/> strikes a balance, wishes apparently
                            virtue opposed to debauchery, <hi rend="i">and vice versa</hi>, for ends
                            of her own.</p>
                        <p>But to return. However mechanically and instinctively it may have
                            started, Life has since developed the more or less gorgeous chemistry of
                            love with which now, if never in the past, it is invested. Human beings
                            are apparently capable of higher and more enduring synthetic and chemic
                            affinities, and this to many has seemed to warrant the second thought
                            wherewith this interview is prefaced. Yet, for all this higher
                            development, the strain of practical life appears to be too much for it.
                            Besides the compulsion imposed by the biologic process which draws two
                            people together there is a process of self-evolution and variation which
                            seems to conflict with the marriage tie. How subtle is that problem
                            which is to keep two people, subject to internal and external chemical
                            and physical changes, harmonious for the eternity for which they are
                            supposed to be linked? Nothing short of this is the theory which the
                            religionist propounds. The moralist, not bound by religious dogma, will
                            make the bond for life only. The philosopher or chemist transmutes the
                            bond into a problem and speculates on how many weeks, or months, or
                            years, the unstable equation may endure.</p>
                        <p>In considering the validity of our ideas in regard to marriage we either
                            accept the current religionistic or moralistic theory, or we do not. For
                            those who do there is no problem: they must accept their chains and
                            slavery, if so they find marriage to be, and make a virtue of their
                            sufferings. For those who do not there is the agonizing problem of the
                            need of an equation in the matter of change. Somewhere they must draw
                            the line, or necessity, increasing age, the difficulty of living in a
                            moving-van, will fix the line for them. Again, there is a limit to any
                            individual&apos;s capacity for change, however kaleidoscopic that
                            may be. After all, any individual, male or female, however attractive,
                            is but single in quantity, and the choice offered to either of a
                            suitable helpmate or companion <pb id="VAA2441-225" n="216"/> is not so
                            very large. One may be forever lowering a hook into the water, but not
                            all the fishes in the sea may take it even if they would. Solomon may
                            have had three hundred wives and seven hundred concubines, but it can
                            scarcely be said that he needed them or that they got much out of it;
                            and while it is conceivable that a man or woman in swift kaleidoscopic
                            search, and devoting him or herself strictly to the task in hand, might
                            enjoy as many as a thousand or so of the opposite sex in the course of a
                            lifetime, it can scarcely be considered valuable from the point of view
                            of public policy and little less than difficult and, as it would seem to
                            one at least, profitless from the point of view of the individual
                            himself.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand there enters into the matter the very serious problem
                            suggested by question IV, which I will incclude and touch on here for a
                            moment only: &quot;Are the children of any union better served by
                            successive marriages than by a home where parents are held together,
                            even though not love but rather by a sense of duty to their
                            children?&quot; Obviously, Nature intended marriage for the
                            reproduction and care of children, but I beg to call attention to the
                            fact that Nature, or God, or the biologic process, or what you will, is
                            no better planner or executor of any given theory or scheme it may have
                            in mind than man himself. If this were not true there would be no
                            physically imperfect men or women. The student of the pathology of sex,
                            as well as of the sources of life itself, is confronted by a thousand
                            variations from that happy norm on which the moralistic marriage must be
                            based. Nature has not provided all its creatures with the capacity for a
                            happy marriage. Plainly, it has cursed or endowed many of them with
                            strange and horrible vices, with vast and self-torturing passions, with
                            immeasurable longings and desires, which unifit them for the proper
                            fulfillment of the monogamic conception of the perfect marriage, hence
                            of the care of the ensuing children. What then is to be done? Who is to
                            blameNature <pb id="VAA2441-226" n="217"/> or man? And if Nature is to
                            blame, or God, cannot we charge the presumed misery of the children up
                            to Him also?</p>
                        <p>Personally, I am not prepared to admit that children are made miserable
                            or destroyed by divorce and change. But granting that, certainly man is
                            not to blame, for from the very beginning he has been crucified upon a
                            rood which is not of his devising. He did not institute marriage; it was
                            instituted for him, the biologic process having devised it long before
                            he appeared apparently. I would gladly have all living creatures endowed
                            with every capacity which would fit them for a peaceful and contented
                            enjoyment of a moralistic life, if that were intended or important, but
                            since in the vast and secret laboratory of Nature alone can man be
                            properly outfitted for the adventure, and since, obviously, in many
                            cases he is not, I submit that the matter of matrimony and the welfare
                            of the ensuing children cannot be solved by talk and that Nature and its
                            concomitants, change and divorce, must be permitted to take their free
                            and unlimited way as they will. The great tides and forces of life which
                            burst upon men and animals and change them do not always give notice
                            that they are about to rise and change things. They rise in their great
                            strength, and man, to his bewilderment, finds himself changing and
                            changed. Hence I would say that the trouble with marriage is that in its
                            extreme interpretation it conflicts with the law of change, or balance
                            and equation, and hence suffers a severe and seemingly destructive
                            defeat.</p>

                        <head type="subtitle">What would be the result were we generally to adopt
                            Ellen Key&apos;s conception of marriage: &quot;Marriage is only
                            moral when it grows from an inner necessity, and not from outward
                            pressure?&quot;</head>
                        <p>Very pleasant, I should say, if logic and ideal syllogism ruled in life.
                            The trouble with this world is that no ideal, <pb id="VAA2441-227"
                                n="218"/> however eagerly pursued, is guaranteed a happy fruition.
                            You may lay down your formula for happiness and say: &quot;Thus and
                            so being done all will be well,&quot; but can you make human nature
                            do anything according to any one finite individual theory? Man does not
                            make or regulate Nature: Nature makes and regulates man, and She makes
                            him any way She pleasesvile, lovely, strong, weak, simple, complex, and
                            so on. There is no one theory that fits all climates or types of people.
                            Life would be very dull if this were true.</p>
                        <p>But I presume by &quot;inner necessity&quot; Ellen Key means
                            intense desire plus a marked affinity of two people for each other, and
                            if the union is for only so long as this endures I should see no
                            drawback to it whatever. I should say that humanity would be much better
                            able to endure the stresses and difficulties of the world if they were
                            all so happily mated, and indeed there might not be so many stres*** and
                            difficulties to endure. No doubt we all wish that this would Lid come
                            true, but not all people are motivated by either love or passion. They
                            would not marry for love if they could but ratlaer for social
                            precedence, material luxuries and the like. They accept children as a
                            somewhat unfortunate concomitant, and so you have the curious problem of
                            whether this state and its results are good, bad or indifferent in so
                            far as society is concerned. For my part I would paraphrase
                            Christ&apos;s idea and say: &quot;Render unto Materiality the
                            things that are Material, and to Love the things that are
                            Love&apos;s,&quot; Then the world would remain just about as it
                            is now.</p>

                        <p>My answer to this question, based on my own individual temperament, would
                            be Yes, but I cannot help speculating <pb id="VAA2441-228" n="219"/> as
                            to the opinions of those whose temperaments are so cool or so
                            unemotional that they can put social precedence, material comfort, or
                            the general welfare of the state, as they see it, above affection or
                            passion Thousands of people are by temperament sacrificial, one might
                            almost say masochistic. They never put themselves first, and that for
                            the very simple reason that their emotions or desires do not compel them
                            so to do. The religionist, the moralist and the fanatic, for reasons of
                            order or material development, as he sees them, would and does look upon
                            love and passion as a disturbing, unsatisfactory and almost unnecessary
                            element in life. Passion is sin or weakness to him, and the individual
                            who requires more than one union to express his emotional necessities is
                            either a lunatic or a criminal. His first impulse is to drive him out of
                            society, to lock him up and reform him by some iron system of training;
                            failing this he will shun him and form little communities of his own
                            into which the victims of emotion and passion must never venture save as
                            thieves steal into a house at night. This last is well and as it should
                            be no doubt in his special case, but on the other hand he is the type of
                            man who is determined that there shall be no divorce for others very
                            unlike himself, who would make wife-desertion a criminal offense of the
                            first order and who would almost punish adultery with death if he could.
                            He is a puritan soul. He does not see Nature in all Her subtle
                            ramifications and climatic and chemic variations, and he helps to make
                            that endless war between the so-called light and darkness of lifebetween
                            sin and virtue and these special phases of aceticism or temperamental
                            coolness are the foundation of all religions apparently.</p>
                        <p>Such individuals would argue, for instance, that the child of a loveless
                            marriage is as well off as a child of a marriage of any other kind,
                            provided be is clothed and fed, washed and schooled and thorougly
                            inculeated with the belief that sex is a crime. The less love enters
                            into the child&apos;s life at any time the better, say they.
                            Children will do better, make better <pb id="VAA2441-229" n="220"/> men
                            and women, and make more money, if they do not love too much. Thus
                            stands the world, divided between the hot and the cold, the stern and
                            the tender, the fools of passion and the fools of material order and
                            well-being. Is the one better or wiser than the other? I do not know.
                            You may pay your money and take your choice, for you cannot well serve
                            passion and materiality at the same time. Personally I stand with the
                            fools of love, because I think for all their follies and errors and
                            Lear-like ends they are happier.</p>

                            if not by love by a sense of duty to their children?</head>
                        <p>I would not say that children are, in the main, better served by
                            successive marriages due to changes of temperament, because I do not
                            know, but I can truly say that I am fairly well satisfied, from my
                            personal observation, that they are no worse served. In the first place
                            the fate of the modern child is not nearly so much in the hands of
                            individual parents as it is in those of the state, the public schools
                            and their teachers, the newspapers and their editors, the judges of
                            courts and public and private citizens generally; for the modern child
                            can almost say to-day that the state is both my father and my mother and
                            it will take care of me. When it can really say this we will be much
                            better off, for we are all going to be happier. The extremes of misery
                            in childhood are going to be done away with.</p>
                        <p>In the next place it is a part of my personal observation that children
                            of warring or troubled homes, where they are made to endure them, are
                            worse off than are those who have escaped through fracture and been
                            thrown on their own resources or are assisted by the charity of the
                            stater or relatives <pb id="VAA2441-230" n="221"/> or the citizens of
                            the country generally, to say nothing of the love or obligation of one
                            or both of the separated parents. There is a deal too much sentiment
                            attaching to the home as such to-day, sentiment not justified by facts.
                            All homes are not ideal rearing-places for children, by any means.
                            Consider the vast factory communities everywhere, too easily forgotten
                            by the comfortable intellectual classes, and again the slums, The homes
                            in these are, if one were to pay strict attention to the moralist, as
                            ideal rearing-places for children as any other; yet we know that life
                            offers pits of horror as well as abodes of sweetness and light in the
                            guise of the modern so-called home. Again, it should be remembered that
                            the home was made for man, not man for the home, and when the home fails
                            as a vehicle of comfort and aid it should be done away with. It is,
                            after all, only wood or stone or plaster, an economic convenience at
                            best. And, anyhow, where the heart is is home, though it be a bed under
                            the open sky or in a new lodging-house every hour. And this
                            generalization is not intended to exclude children either. The children
                            of troubled warring homes live in a kind of hell of temperament from
                            which they are glad enough to escape as they grow older, and from which
                            they evolve the dream of building something better for themselves, for
                            they realize the horror of the thing they have endured.</p>
                        <p>The basic reason for destroying many a home is that the children may not
                            be injured. All life administers its sternest reprimands to those who
                            abuse children. Life loves children. It really prefers them to their
                            eldersthe biologic process so does. There is a public obligation to them
                            which we all acknowledge. But this is not to say that all parents should
                            therefore be compelled to rear their children. It may well be that they
                            are not fitted economically or mentally or otherwise so to do. Their
                            whole duty is, or might well be, done when they support them properly.
                            The state should do the rest, for, as I have just suggested, most people
                            are not fit to rear their <pb id="VAA2441-231" n="222"/> children; and I
                            say this with the greatest respect for the human and very charming
                            impulse which causes them to wish to. The intellectual standards of the
                            average individual are not much; these of the state are in the main
                            better and should and may be trusted to do better by the children than
                            any of millions of parents.</p>

                        <p>P. S. To sum it all up I should like to advance anothi theory of mine in
                            regard to the duality of sex. It is quite probable that in the beginning
                            (biologically speaking) sexual progenitor of the human race or of
                            evoiated species aw twined in itself the full chemical content of what
                            has since been evoluted into the so-called male aisd female. Such being
                            case its chemical responsiveness to the movements of the universe, <pb
                                id="VAA2441-232" n="223"/> chemical, physical, spiritual, cr let us
                            say emotional, and to its immediate surroundings, was complete in
                            itself. It was not divided into two sexes and therefore not dependent on
                            any alienated portion of itself for its chemical, spiritual, emotional
                            or physical satiation. What happened to it individually and momentarily
                            was all that could happen to it. It needed no complementary organism, no
                            other half, to make its understanding of, its reaction to, life
                            complete. That is not true to-day, Man (male or female) appears to be
                            individual and complete, but it is an illusion. He is complete and
                            separate as an organism in everything save his chemical responsiveness
                            to the universe which requires his union, not merely physically but
                            spiritually, with his sexual companion to be complete. Their union
                            sexually, temperamentally, emotionally, intellectually and so on is
                            required before a full measure of chemical responsiveness to life can be
                            attained in either. It may seem otherwise in individual cases, but it is
                            not so. Such being the case (and a world of biological data might be
                            here introduced), you have the amazing spectable of love which confounds
                            all, theories of life, which laughs at death, and, in its fullest
                            expression, defies all human theory and understanding, acting as a <hi
                                rend="i">new</hi> non-understandable thing, and letting, and letting
                            in dreams, emotions, conditions from a deeper world than any we know and
                            whereby this shadow called existence is resolved, modified, made over
                            into something else so that it bears no resemblance to its former state.
                            It becomes apparently what it well may be: a dream and an illusion of
                            beauty or delight, or all. Evolutionary progress seems to be based on
                            this non-unerstandable, mysterious, idealistic reaction and contact
                            which baffles the most searching suggestions and contact which baffies
                            the most searching suggestions and intuitions of the imagination and
                            leaves us awed and dumb before the great classics of desire and
                            passion.</p>
                        <p>But the great fact, not to be lost sight of, is that love, complete
                            chemical responsiveness to the universe, is only atained <pb

                            universe. Man does not soar emotionally into the empyrean except in
                            love, and by &quot;in love&quot; I mean when stirred by the sex
                            impulse which makes for mate-seeking and union. It does not follow that
                            there need ever be physical satiation to complete this union. Spiritual
                            pollination can spring from the merest accidental contact for a moment
                            with a mate. But the fact remains that the greatest, most complete
                            spiritual and physical responsiveness to the universe (which after all
                            is a mere matter of chemical reaction) springs from this responsiveness,
                            which springs from love, and as such our so-called love (desire,
                            passionate chemical response, physical and spiritual) becomes the most
                            significant fact in the universe as we now understand it. For what is

                    <head>MORE DEMOCRACY OR LESS? AN INQUIRY</head>
                    <p>IN my youth no country was so significant to me as the United States, of
                        course, so wonderful, so fully representative of the natural spirit of
                        aspiration in man, his dreams, hopes, superior and constructive
                        possibilities. All that America did, could do, had done, was in line with
                        the noblest and best principles in Nature, as I then understood Nature. And
                        I still believe that this nation might be one of tremendous significance in
                        connection with intellectual development, but some marked changes will need
                        to come about.</p>
                    <p>Plainly, in a material and (socially speaking) internal organic way, it has
                        accomplished much, even if thus far its intellectual stature has not proved
                        so tremendous. We are, as I see it now, a deeply-illusioned people,
                        concerned solely with material things when they are really no longer very
                        importantcertainly not as much so as when the land was new and without
                        material meansand yet we remain almost entirely interested in such things
                        when our minds should be beginning to grasp the wider possibilities of
                        lifestill fighting over beef and coal trusts and railroads and cables, the
                        mere money return involvedwho is to have the control of themwhen we ought to
                        be intensely concerned with the mysteries of chemistry and physics and a
                        more pliable form of government.</p>
                    <p>Though my personal feeling once was that America was destined to take high
                        rank, if not complete leadership, in the intellectual world, I am now not so
                        sure. At this writing it looks as though it might retrograde, and that
                        speedily, and give place to newer landsnewer in spirit, I mean. It may not,
                        but the signs are somewhat against it. Our literature has plainly developed
                        to the level of the best seller and then <pb id="VAA2441-235" n="226"/>
                        stopped. Our art is sporadic, and with a few exceptions lymphatic and
                        strongly suggestive of older forms. The futuristic dream did not originate
                        here. Our sciencewell, who are our American scientists anyhow? Loeb? Carel?
                        Tesla? Bell? All foreigners.</p>
                    <p>In architecture, markedly allied, I must say, to mechanics, in which we
                        flourish, we have done betteryes, and in anything and everything which
                        relates, or has, to mechanics, trade, commercial organization. In those
                        things, indeed, we have appeared to do most astoundingly, although I am
                        firmly convinced that the boundless and virgin resources of the land have
                        had as muchmore, in factto do with this than anything else. We have not had
                        so much to create as to develop, and other countries and other
                        financierstheir trade geniuseshave done quite as well if not better in some
                        instances than have we. I refer to such concerns and individuals as the
                        English East India Company, the Royal Dutch Shell, the Allgemeine
                        Elektrische Gesellschaft, the Curard, Allen and other such organizations, to
                        say nothing of such individuals as Lord Strathcona, Baron Shibusawa, Cecil
                        Rhodes, Lord Cowdray, Alfred Harmsworth, Sir Thomas Lipton, etc.</p>
                    <p>Indeed the one thing I would like to point out most definitely in passing is
                        this: that the by now ingrown idea in every average American&apos;s mind
                        that all of the most significant inventions ard discoveries, mental as well
                        as mechanical, of the last hundred years or more are entirely of American
                        origin is not true by any means. Far from it. Those great prime moversfor
                        instance, the steam engine, the electric motor, and the gas engine (as well
                        as its natural child, the automobile)came to us from abroad. So did the
                        telegraph, the railroad, radium, X-ray photography andwhat is most
                        remarkable, considering that the ironclad came from hereevery step in steel
                        manufacture. The telephone was invented by a Scot who was twentyfive years
                        old when he became an emigrant to our country.</p>
                    <p>Other countries, so I was condescendingly taughtEgypt, <pb id="VAA2441-236"
                            n="227"/> Greece, Rome, France, England, Spain (for a little while) and
                        Hollandin times past and even approximating our own day, had been blessed
                        with some opportunities and had done considerable toward fulfilling what I
                        was taught was not so much the material as the spiritual and moral
                        well-being of manhis intellectual and therefore his mental and social
                        happiness. But nevertheless and never before, however (or since), had any
                        country had? or could have, the natural, noble and spiritual impulse, to say
                        nothing of the amazing opportunities, which America, the United States, was
                        enjoyinga vast and fertile soil, an equable climate, engrossing varieties of
                        scenery, a people given over entirely to industry, frugality and proper
                        social and spiritual ideals. In other words America, according to my
                        teachers, was destined to lead the world in thought, truth, beauty, liberty,
                        justice, industry, and what not achievement, among other things.</p>
                    <p>Well, consider Greece in its day, faced by or placed in a virgin and
                        undiscovered world. To the south and east Egypt and Phoenicia, to the north
                        and west darkness, mystery, an unexplored world. No ships but oared boatsnot
                        even the trireme at firstno compass, no machinery, no implements of
                        agriculture, and consider that to-day we quote Galen, Hippocrates and
                        AEsculapius, its doctors; Euripides, Sophocles, AEschylus and Aristophanes,
                        its playwrights; Herodotus and Xenophon, its historians; Demosthenes, its
                        orator; Homer, Anacreon, Pindar and Sappho, its poets; AEsop and Helodorus,
                        its writers; Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and twenty others, its
                        philosophersthe greatest in all the worldSolon, Alcibiades, Pericles,
                        Aristides, and ten others, its statesmen. Also we marvel at Praxiteles,
                        Phidias and Skopas, its sculptors; Alexander, Miltiades and Themistocles,
                        its generals; and Archimedes, its mathematician. Nations, like individuals,
                        are apparently born with genius, or they are not. They think, or they do
                        not; they are dull merchants and tricksters like the Carthaginians and
                        Phcenicians, or they are not.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2441-237" n="228"/>
                    <p>America at the present moment, these United States, suggests nothing so much
                        as the trading Carthaginians and Phoenicians. We have, apparently, no soul
                        for really great things intellectually, and yet we have done a few things,
                        toofought wars for our own integrity, invented a number of very useful
                        machinesthe cotton gin, sewing-machine, flying-machine and U-boatgrown rich
                        and great in size, freed the slaves (which England did in her realm without
                        a war), liberated Cuba (no exploitation since?), struggled with the
                        Philippine problem, the Mexican problem, and some others, but to no definite
                        end as yet, however. And yet our deeds are plainly so incommensurate to our
                        power. For we still have with us the Negroes, the clash and plotting of
                        various rival sectarians, easily allayed by a truly educated race, the
                        growth and almost complete independence of various private interests and
                        individualspuritairism run all but mad and to the death of genuine
                        intellectuality, artistic or otherwise, etc. And yet to the average American
                        it remains a belief or fact that within our borders, safe under the control
                        and guidance of a human and helpful Constitution or form of government, are
                        all the social, commercial and mental opportunities to which an ambitious
                        citizen of the world may logically aspirefreedom to think, to grow mentally
                        and in every other way, to acquire tremendous wealth and be a person in whom
                        the inventive and constructive processes of Nature can take the liveliest
                        interest. Indeed, whatever may have befallen him socially or economically in
                        recent years, he is still convinced that lie is absolutely freefreer than
                        the constituent individuals of any other nation, that he is a great thinker
                        and leader in things intellectual and that America is the best and most
                        carefully administered country in the world, administered entirely, or
                        nearly so, on his behalf.</p>
                    <p>Well, I have no very great quarrel with that as a theory, a method of
                        expressing one&apos;s private vital force, but is it true? In my
                        personal judgment, America as yet certainly is neither a <pb
                            id="VAA2441-238" n="229"/> social nor a democratic success. Its original
                        democratic theory does not work, or has not, and a trust- and a
                        law-frightened people, to say nothing of a cowardly or suborned and in any
                        case helpless press, prove it. Where in any country not dominated by an
                        autocracy has ever a people more pathetically and ridiculously slipped about
                        afraid to voice its views on war, on freedom of speech, freedom of the
                        press, the trusts, religionindeed any honest private conviction that it has?
                        In what country even less free can a man be more thoroughly browbeaten,
                        arrested without trial, denied the privilege of a hearing and held against
                        the written words of the nation&apos;s own Constitution guaranteeing its
                        citizens freedom of speech, of public gathering, of writing and publishing
                        what they honestly feel? In what other lands less free are whole elements
                        held in a caste conditionthe Negro, the foreign-born, the Indian?</p>
                    <p>When one considers the history of American commercial development, the growth
                        of private wealth, of its private leadersthe Rockefellers, Morgans,
                        Vanderbilts, Goulds, Ryans, et al., indeed all the railroad, street-car,

                        base our plea for the transcendent merits of democracy, and I am as good a
                        democrat as most Americans, if not more so.</p>
                    <p>Government everywhere, in monarchies and republics, as well as tyrannies and
                        despotisms, has, other things being equal, always kept step with the natural
                        development of the intelligence of the mass, a thing which has been as much
                        developed by the goads of tyrannies as by the petting of republics. But
                        could you ever convince a full-fledged American, raised on <pb
                            id="VAA2441-239" n="230"/> Fourth of July orations and the wonders and
                        generosities of the American Constitution, of this? For him, of course,
                        liberty began in 1776 at Bunker Hill or somewhere near it. Before that was
                        no light anywhere. Since then we have gone ondoing better and better, making
                        all men richer happier, kinder, wiser.</p>
                    <p>But have we? Is our land and its progress so absolutely flawless? Aside from
                        love of country and individual vanity which might make us want to think so,
                        have we not developed as many flaws, anachronisms, social and governmental
                        irri-tations and oppressions as any other country? I call attention to the
                        deliberation and ease with which the trusts organize our legislatures,
                        dictate to the jurists of the land, deny evey the permanence or sacredness
                        of contract when it concerns them; rob, pillage and tax to their
                        hearts&apos; content while a pitiful mass at the bottom march to and fro
                        wondering where or to whom to turn for relief. And, on the other hand, life
                        here, as much as elsewherethe struggling massis as savagely pushed by
                        necessity as any mass anywhere. Our labor unrest is as great, cur poverty as
                        keen; five per cent, or so it is alleged, of the population controlling
                        ninety-five per cent of the wealth; thirteen per cent of the population
                        illiterate; at the top gorgons of financiers as fat and comfortable and
                        dictatorial as any the world has ever seen and as unpatriotic and
                        un-American, in so far as its original theory goes, as may be. Worse yet, it
                        is absolutely true that ours is, or was, materially at least, a rich land,
                        boundless in its opportunities at first, which latter fact has contributed
                        greatly to our optimism but not to our comfort. More rapidly here than
                        anywhere in the world the rich have divided themselves from the poor, and
                        now here as elsewhere necessity and pain are and will remain no douht the
                        goads to comparative ease. Yet the tramping American when he uiters the
                        marvelous word democracy believes that he has it, and when he is not
                        complaining and the newspapers tell him so, believes that he is perfectly
                        happy.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, considering our aggressive and progressive <pb
                            id="VAA2441-240" n="231"/> financial leadersand heaven forbid (on
                        humanitarian grounds, at least) that I should defend them, for a more
                        selfish, cruel and undemocratic pack never lived (consider the packers, the
                        street-car corporations, the rsihoads alone, not to mention a thousand
                        others)there is this to be said, that although nearly every crime in the
                        decalogue may be charged to them, bribery, perjury, murder, even a total
                        indifference to individual welfare (twelve and a half cents an hour, for
                        instance, up to six years ago for hard, grinding day labor on a railroad or
                        in a canning factory), as well as greed, love of power, and lust after
                        itstill much if not all of America&apos;s boasted financial supremacy is
                        due to them and to none other. We jeer at John D. Rockefeller at home
                        perhaps, or Morgan, but when abroad among envious strangers who is first to
                        thrust out his chest and boast of what America has doneits financial
                        leaders, no less? Who? The average American? You know so. Such being the
                        case one often wonders what is to be done with a country or a people that
                        can so readily blow hot and cold out of the same mouth. Can it be made to
                        follow an austere democratic programthe sharp, taut socialization of
                        everythingor will it succumb to autocratic or to financial domination, and
                        if so, which? At the present moment the air hums with the rival theories. To
                        me the chief problem in connection with America, if it has one, and as I see
                        it, is that of finding itself mentally as well as finding a formula that
                        will allow and encourage leadership without submitting to the abuses which
                        in the past and even the present the latter tends to give rise. For here as
                        much as anywhere else the average small American is as much a petty tyrant
                        as may be found. Consider only the food profiteer, the small dealers,
                        jobbers and wholesalers. And here, as elsewhere, are all the petty tyrannies
                        of small and large enterprises in regard to wage-earners, the scorns, the
                        brutalities, the exactions. Can these be outrivaled if readily duplicated in
                        any autocracy or democracy ruled by a dictator anywhere? At the same time,
                            <pb id="VAA2441-241" n="232"/> is it not true that, if the country is to
                        succeed or at least progress materially, a place must be made for the
                        selfish, self-aggrandizing individual either as leader politically or as
                        creator? Will life go forward without some such process or opportunities for
                        immense rewards or honors to the individualthe right to satisfy his feverish
                        if ridiculous ambition for supremacy? Will patriotism, love of country,
                        alone do it? Can it be discovered?</p>
                    <p>What made Rome great? <hi rend="i">Senatus populusque Romanus.</hi> The
                        Senate supplied the leadership, the people the impulse and force, which
                        spread the dominion of the shepherds of the Seven Hills until it ruled the
                        world from Scotland to the Nubian Desert and the confines of India. What is
                        the secret of the Roman church&apos;s preminence? Leadership? Autocracy?
                        In the early Christian church these were lacking. Think or say what you will
                        of its results, but consider it. In so far as the early Christians were
                        concerned they were all &quot;brethren,&quot; like the Russians of
                        to-day and the citizens of the French Revolution, Each early Christian
                        community elected its deacons; the deacons elected the priests; the priests
                        elected the bishops; the bishops elected the cardinals; and the cardinals
                        the pope. Before the Catholic church began to attain to its strength,
                        however, the process was reversed: the pope appointed the cardinal, he the
                        bishop, the bishop the priest. Then the deacons were selected by the priest,
                        in certain cases some deacons were elective, but then the priest and deacon,
                        appointed by the bishop, constituted the majority of the board. It was then,
                        and then only, that the Roman church began to flourish truly. The ambition
                        of man had full scope, his vanity. Apparently the world hitherto has not
                        been able to do or live without it. On the authorization basis of leadership
                        the Roman church, the most impressive organization in human history, has
                        stood for seventeen centuries.</p>
                    <p>But take our own Standard Oil Company. Who built it? Who used to caution all
                        his lieutenants never to talk, to keep <pb id="VAA2441-242" n="233"/>
                        everything a secret, particularly its prosperity? And has not the blessing
                        of cheap oil been extended to all the world? Who selected strong, ambitious
                        men and set them to planning the monopoly of oil for their personal and
                        private benefit, dickered with the railroads and cut the throats of his
                        rivals via the rebate? Does his name have to be written here? Call him a
                        scoundrel, scoff at autocracy and high and mighty plutocrats. After all, can
                        a man or a woman become a safe or dictatorial plutocrat without having
                        something to offer which makes his plutocracy and his dictatorship bearable?
                        Have mere dull tyrants anywhere ever lasted long? Have they ever had brains
                        enough? Most of Rome&apos;s worst emperors were slain in anywhere from
                        three to five years. The tyrants of Asia and Africa last, if they do,
                        because the people are as dull as themselves, or their rule is agreeable to
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Every great business corporation, as we know, is built about the personality,
                        the leadership, the autocracy, of one man. We hear of love of country, of
                        putting the needs of the mass, one&apos;s countryall countriesabove that
                        of one&apos;s personal or private needs. There are noble examples no
                        doubt (off-hand few occur to me) of unselfish public sacrifice of many, many
                        private lives, but are they the rule or the exception? Does not the average
                        individual now as heretofore consult his own interest, his advantage, his
                        purse, his survival, his fame? Once one is large and secure, easy in the
                        possession of fame, money, love even, it is possible, of courseand even with
                        a grandiose airto do generously, to give freely, to seek the advantage of
                        the mass. Scarcely any other avenue of personal satisfaction remains open. I
                        am not sneering; I am contemplating a possibly chemic, physic or psychic
                        law. Who knows?</p>
                    <p>Taking the average individual, with life (necessity, hunger, drouths of one
                        kind and another) pressing upon him as fiercely as it does, and
                        contemplating America as it is and the world as it is, is it not fair to ask
                        whether it is possible to make over manhis ambitions, his soul, into the
                        likeness of what is <pb id="VAA2441-243" n="234"/> suggested by the average
                        modern democratic or republican or socialistic program? Can he be adjusted
                        to it? Haven&apos;t we just had two thousand years of an attempt in one
                        form? Possibly he can, but is it wise that he should? Are not striking,
                        centralizing figures more important and, save during extremely patriotic
                        moments, when some danger, say, threatens the national organism as a whole,
                        is it not extremely difficult to cause the average individual to enthuse
                        over a crowd or the needs of a crowd? And on the contrary, is it not most
                        pathetically easy to cause him to enthuse over a man or a womanto cause any
                        of us so to do? It would almost look as though it were Nature&apos;s
                        way, would it notthe love of the mass for leaders, for grandiose,
                        grandiloquent figures? Is not life, in the main, personal, individual? Think
                        how we insist on identifying God as an individual. Will not such leadership
                        as was offered by Alexander, Hannibal, Mohammed, Napoleon, Washington,
                        Lincoln, always be popular? The leadership of lesser or more
                        self-aggrandizing individualssuch as, for instance, that of the late James
                        J. Hill, of the Great Northern Railway; E. H. Harriman, of the Union
                        Pacific; Cornelius Vanderbilt, of the New York Central; Jay Gould, of the
                        Missouri Pacific; Jay Cooke, of Civil War Finance; Armour, Field, Leiter,
                        Morgan, or, to come down to the present moment, John H. Patterson, of the
                        National Cash Register; Henry Ford, of the jitney; F. W. Woolworth, of the
                        five-and-ten-cent storeif never popular, still does it not remain necessary?
                        Must not some one lead even in the home and all forms of private commercial
                        adventure? It may not be an absolutely invariable rule, but is it not near
                        enough to make it seem so? I am not quarreling with the possibilities of
                        love, generosity, self-sacrifice, public and private. We all hope for them,
                        do we not? In various minor ways at least, and even in some public and large
                        ways, they exist. But how about self-interest, cold, savage and yet
                        constructive if feverish self-interest? Has that been abrogated?</p>
                    <p>Indeed, ought not we Americans, of all people, learn, and <pb
                            id="VAA2441-244" n="235"/> learn quickly, that autocracy in whatever
                        form you find itabsolute or otherwiseis never real autocracy, not absolute,
                        and that on the other hand so-called democracy is never real democracy but
                        always something tempered by private autocracy in a thousandnay, in a
                        millionforms? For after all, who tells such people as Rockefeller and
                        Woolworth, to say nothing of kings and emperorsfallible and seeking souls,
                        allhow, what, why, they must do?how far they may go? What to interest
                        themselves in? Consider the fall of the French kings, Charles I., the late
                        Czar. They deal with the mass, and therefore to a certain extent they must
                        respect it. They cannot escape it. It is their fate. At the same time, in
                        attempting so to do, to whom do they not listen really for sound
                        advice?often to the least of their subjects or hirelings. The stockholders
                        in any modern corporationare they any more as to voice and weight in that
                        which their money makes possible than the people out in the street of a
                        republic or a kingdom with their ultimate veto power? They elect a board of
                        directors as we elect a senate, or a monarchy, a legislature. And this
                        leadership perpetuates itself, or at any rate holds things together, as does
                        officialdom at Washington, until a leader appears. A weak king or emperor is
                        run by strong men, a weak President is dictated to by a strong Senate or
                        House. When the Roman Senate was strong the dictators were weak, and vice
                        versa. In calm, peaceful days leadership is not necessary. It is or may be a
                        disturbing factor. But when changes are coming, when Nature is brewing a
                        stormthen. So life, with its endless brewing of storms and leaders, ought to
                        give a hint to republics or democracies or corporate organizations.</p>
                    <p>And, having said so much, is it not plain that room must be made always for
                        the leader, the passing autocrat, if you will? Must he not be givenif he
                        have brainsthe right of initiative and power, for after all is he not also a
                        slave to life, chance, labor, the time-spirit? It is to be assumed, of
                        course, that men shall demand first that he command their admiration <pb
                            id="VAA2441-245" n="236"/> and loyalty, as he certainly will if he is a
                        real leader. Rome admired her Caesar, France her Napoleon; Germany evidently
                        liked her Kaiser, France her Clemenceau, England her Lloyd George. They
                        thought them, apparently, necessary and great leaders. In our contest with
                        Germany we perhaps, for one nation, were fighting to make her dislike
                        something which she craved and needed, could not probably very well do
                        without.</p>
                    <p>The trouble, as I see it, is that too often, in spite of all the current
                        palaver and enthusiasm of some for special individuals, we have too little
                        real or popular leadership. Middleweight idealists and theorists are too
                        often at the steering-gear here as well as elsewhere. In this country we
                        have the crowd, the extraordinarily well-educated (or we think so) and
                        disciplined crowd, willing and eager for leadership. But what leadership? As
                        it stands, all democracies are organized with elaborate systems of
                        checkslegislative, executivewhich are intended to and do tie the hands of
                        all possible leaders, until a very, very great emergency arises. In the
                        ordinary run of days and events only the ordinary politician or
                        parlor-diplomat need apply. But when an extreme necessity calls, these
                        minors must give way, but does the true leader always appear in time? Will
                        he? Did the Allies have a truly able anti-Teutonic leader in the recent
                        great struggle? Joffre? Asquith? Lloyd George? Kerensky? Wilson? Nicholas
                        Romanoff?</p>
                    <p>Our Federal Constitution, theoretically at least, gives us a crowd
                        government; only, owing to the wholly undemocratic character of the American
                        people, this has long since been replaced by money or trust government, the
                        rule of the wealthy by right of subornation. And our state and municipal
                        governments, modeled on that of the nation, have gone the same way. Even
                        such little individuality and leadership for the mass as might possibly
                        exist under these conditions is lost or discarded nearly every two or four
                        years in the regular and money-controlled changes of administration. The old
                        and experienced are replaced with the new and untried. Perhaps under
                        conditions <pb id="VAA2441-246" n="237"/> as they are this is best. I am not
                        sure. But for efficiency, after the manner of the great successful private
                        corporations, is it? Personally, I think notnot yet, at any rate. As yet
                        democracy does not take sufficient interest in itself, is too indifferent to
                        its real interests and needs. It is too easy-going, not sufficiently self
                        compelling. Every one wants to be his own boss and to be a great,
                        undemocratic, individual success, hence there is very little true effective
                        organization outside private institutions and what they compel in a public
                        way. We make no provision for the continuation of leadership even under
                        emergency.</p>
                    <p>Personally, I think the defect cannot forever go on unremedied. Democracy
                        must do at least as well as autocracy, or it ought to shut up shop. And if
                        it cannot obtain the efficiency exemplified by the private corporataion it
                        will, and it will deserve to. Perhaps our recent sad experiences in meeting
                        the expanded demands on governmental efficiency should show us how to lay a
                        new basis for that efficiency in modifications of our governmental
                        structure. But will they? What I think is that more autocracy, behind which
                        should be a livelier sense of power and control on the part of the people,
                        should come into our democracy, or our democracy will really cease to be.
                        The present drift toward money control cannot go unchecked. Our leaders will
                        either become much more forceful, and the mass more watchful and jealous, as
                        it should be, or we will have no democracy of any kind. There is scarcely
                        any now. Congress should be used more against the President and the Supreme
                        Court, and the latter against both, only the judges should be plainly
                        responsible to the people, closely and fear-somely beholden to themas much
                        so, at any rate, as they now are to the corporations and wealth. Both the
                        leaders and their weaponsthe lawsshould become more vigorous. Democracy will
                        have to step up, and step lively. Then will it be any more of a democracy
                        than some of the older and more historic autocracies and monarchies? Will
                        it?</p>

                            Clymene, and brother of Atlas, Menoetius and Epimetheus (after-thought),
                            is represented as the creator of man, out of earth and water, and his
                            great benefactor, having given him, in spite of Zeus who was apparently
                            opposed to it all, a portion of all the qualities possessed by the other
                            animals. He also stole fire from heaven in a hollow tube, and taught
                            mortals all useful arts. In order to punish Prometheus for this, Zeus
                            gave Pandora to Epimetheus, his brother, in consequence of which
                            diseases and sufferings of every kind befell mortals. He also chained
                            Prometheus to a rock on Mount Caucasus, where during the daytime an
                            eagle consumed his liver, which was restored each succeeding night.
                            Prometheus was thus exposed to perpetual torture; but Hercules
                            (strength) killed the eagle and with the consent of Zeus, who in this
                            way had an opportunity of allowing his son to gain immortal fame,
                            delivered the sufferer.&quot;</hi>

                    <p>The significance of these several references to and quotations from the
                        supposed creative power of the elder pagan world is, if anything, that man
                        is a waif and an interloper in Nature (or things celestial or intelligent),
                        a machine or toy, created by something which desires to use him or work
                        through him in some way, with no essential power to make his own way and no
                        &quot;right&quot; to seek either knowledge or wisdom, lest, in the
                        words attributed to Jehovah, his Creator, in Genesis, he becomes
                        &quot;as one of us,&quot; a minor god, for instance, as the Creator
                        via this phrase writes himself down to be; not the Supreme Ruler of the
                        Universe, by any means. And in this phrase (&quot;one of us&quot;)
                        is contained a hint of a possible condition or order in the universe which,
                        since the Christian era, has been put aside as untrue, namely, that the
                        Creator of man, our two billion two-legged citizens stalking this earth, may
                        be but (to use a very crude and yet for that reason understandable
                        description) <pb id="VAA2441-249" n="240"/> a &quot;side-line&quot;
                        manufacturer, as it were, or a lower-level competitor for life and pleasure,
                        along with many others of his kindCreators or &quot;Gods&quot; or
                        avatars of, let us say, mosquitos, flies, bulls; cats, dogs; in other words
                        the specific and singular Creator of some one thing as opposed to other Gods
                        or powers who might well be creators of other things of equal rank. And
                        these &quot;Gods,&quot; in turn, should one choose to follow the
                        thought, might well be the special product of some greater
                        &quot;God&quot; or manufacturer or Creator who is finding a rather
                        peculiar expression through them and their creations in turn; also the
                        various rivalries which exist between man and the lower animals for the
                        possession of the earth might thereby be explained or have something to do
                        with that.</p>
                    <p>The thought is not new. Alfred Russel Wallace, co-discoverer with Darwin,
                        Lamarck and Spencer of the theory of evolution, has pointed out that
                        &quot;the organizing mind which actually carries out the development of
                        the life world need not be infinite, need not be what is usually meant by
                        the term God or Deity. The main cause of the antagonism between religion and
                        science seems to me to be the assumption by both that there are no
                        existences capable of taking part in the work of creation other than blind
                        forces on the one hand and the infinite, eternal, omnipotent God on the
                        other. The apparently gratuitous creation by theologians of a hierarchy of
                        angels and archangels, with no defined duties but those of attendants and
                        messengers of the Deity, perhaps increases this antagonism.&quot; He
                        then proceeds to develop a theory of his own in which (I quote)
                        &quot;the vast, the infinite chasm between ourselves and the Deity is to
                        some extent occupied by an almost infinite series of grades of beings, each
                        successive grade having higher and higher powers in regard to the
                        origination, the development and the control of the universe.&quot; He
                        goes on to show how this might be done by themall to the one end: namely,
                        the creation and preparation of man via experiences here, persumably for a
                        higher place in the control of the universe at large, always <pb
                            id="VAA2441-250" n="241"/> under the Supreme Ruler of course and his
                        lesser, yet in so far as man is concerned greater, agents. In other words,
                        under these sub-Gods.</p>
                    <p>The idea is interesting only it does not, although it may be too much to say
                        that it cannot, explain the endless bickering and chaffering in the universe
                        at large, the utter failure of various movements and types here on earth and
                        apparently elsewhere, the astonishing selection of so minute a mote in the
                        material universe as this particular planet for the purpose of working out a
                        higher type of assistant or worshiper of God Himself. It may be true, but
                        the idea is a little fantastic and suggests the labors of an ignorant and
                        yet hopeful being endeavoring to account for himself, his presence, in the
                        best way he can.</p>
                    <p>To my humble way of thinking, the ancient Greeks and the various theogonies
                        of the ancient pagan world (Egyptian, Chaldean, Hindu) were at least as
                        plausible in their apprehension of a troublesome disorder. The Old Testament
                        and all other forms of ancient pagan literature suggest the general and very
                        natural conception, based on the evidence of life itself, that various gods
                        were or are contending via various forms of life (animal, vegetable and
                        mineral) for some form of expression here on earth, and that the various
                        things which they make (or the one thing which each makes, its image and
                        likeness perhaps) is opposed to all others here. Pagan thought reeked with
                        the feeling of contests between gods or creators or controllers of this,
                        that and the other, and in the Sinaitic interpretation of life just quoted
                        we see something of the same thing; also in what small consideration man was
                        held by his alleged special Creator. Evidently the conclusion reached by the
                        thinking elders of the pagan world was that man, in so far as his own
                        special Creator was concerned, was viewed with sinister opposition by the
                        power which made him. It did not want him to amount to anything. Indeed he
                        was very, very plainly conscious of the inimical attitude of Nature, or <pb
                            id="VAA2441-251" n="242"/> rather man&apos;s especial God or
                        Creator, toward him. He was not as yet deluded by the Christian phantasm
                        that man is made in the image and likeness of his Creator, who is highly
                        considerate of him, and that the world was made for man, or that because of
                        faith, good deeds, special forms of self-abnegation and self-effacement he
                        is to be reserved to eternal bliss hereafter although there is no especial
                        reward for him here and now. And this is excellent indeed as illustrating a
                        force or forces of a creative turn which might wish to use man as man uses
                        any other minor implement for the accomplishment of any purpose he may have,
                        but not very complimentary to him as an illustration of his own free and
                        creative powers.</p>
                    <p>And, curiously, modern chemistry with its various tropismshelio, magnetic,
                        stereo and chemotogether with its legal part, physics, does little better by
                        him. Already they tend to show that he is merelyand, what is worse,
                        accidentally soan evoluted arrangement of attractions and repulsions,
                        arranged by chemicals and forces which desire or cannot escape whorls or
                        epitomes of complicated motions and emotions or attractions which take the
                        odd forms presented by men and animals.</p>
                    <p>But aside from this the most effective illustration of the essential
                        nothingness of man is his plain <hi rend="i">individual</hi> weakness here
                        and now as contrasted with his mass ideals and the huge vanity or tendency
                        toward romance which causes him to wish to seem to be more than he really is
                        or can ever hope to be. For plainly every life, in the last analysis,
                        however useful to an assumed and carefully directing Creator, or however
                        successful from a momentary analysis it may appear, is a failure. We hear of
                        that curious thing, &quot;a successful life.&quot; It is in the main
                        a myth, a self-delusion. How could there possibly success for a watery,
                        bulbous, highly limited and specially functioned creature, lacking (in the
                        case of man, for instance) many of the superior attributes of other
                        animalswings, sense of direction, foreknowledge and the likeand manufactured
                            <pb id="VAA2441-252" n="243"/> every forty years by hundreds of
                        millions, century in and century out, made apparently not in the image and
                        likeness of anything superior to himself but in that of an accidentally
                        compelled pattern, due to an accidental arrangement of chemicals, his every
                        move and aspiration anticipated and accounted for by a formula and an
                        accidentally evolved system long before he arrives, and he himself born
                        puling, compact of vain illusions in regard to himself, his
                        &quot;mission,&quot; his dominant relation to the enormous schemes
                        of Nature, and ending, if &quot;life&quot; endures so long, in
                        toothless senility and watery decay, dissolution. And in addition some have
                        scientifically placed the creative as well as the generative period of man
                        between his twentieth and fortieth yearstwenty years! Others generously
                        extend it to fifty and even sixty. Few venture to carry it beyond that. At
                        seventy old Nestor drools and repeats his fables of his few years and many
                        troubles. At fifty, even forty-five, most men are busy recounting the deeds,
                        adventures and creations of their earlier years!</p>
                    <p>To me the most astonishing thing in connection with man is this same vanity
                        or power of romanticising everything relating to himself, so that whereas in
                        reality he is what he is, a Structure of brief import and minute social or
                        any other form of energy, left by his loving Creator to contest in the most
                        drastic and often fatal way with thousands, one might almost say millions of
                        inimical powers and only significant really in so far as he or it is
                        interlocked with others in some larger unity, either (for illustration) as a
                        soldier in an army or its delegated commander or as a delegated or
                        acknowledged representative of some moving or mass or race impulse, still he
                        has this astonishing power of viewing himself as a tremendous force in
                        himself, a god, a hero, an enduring and undying figure of glory and beautyas
                        significant almost as the Creator Himself, in whose image and likeness he is
                        supposed to be made!</p>
                    <p>The wonder! The beauty even!</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2441-253" n="244"/>
                    <p>Sometimes I think all this is the almost inevitable result of something
                        inherently weak but with one clear power: that of visualizing or perceiving
                        strength in other things and so, by contrast, its own weakness; and, by
                        reflex action merely, attempting to salve itself against its own
                        ineffectiveness by imagining itself to be that which it may never be: a
                        victor, a Colossus bestriding the world, an undying potentate, ruling
                        forever, and so gaining strength to go on. For individuals are never masters
                        in any remarkable way. They merely and at best borrow or direct the energies
                        of many, and in the main to no important result to themselves. A Napoleon
                        slaves and starves to the end that he may die on St. Helena and bring
                        considerable profit to many who never heard of him and care not at all. A
                        Caesar toils endlessly at organization and the development and preservation
                        of Rome, only to be stabbed to death in his fifty-sixth year, practically
                        unrewarded. A Hannibal slaves for Carthage, enduring endless hardships, only
                        to die by his own hand. The category might be extended indefinitely. And yet
                        the world is full of laudations of the powers of men, their satisfactions,
                        their vast, vast rewards and glories; while so many decayed steles and
                        temple doorways, and data unending, bear testimony to their utter material
                        and subsequent spiritual futility.</p>
                    <p>And when I say this I wish to make it perfectly clear that I am by no means
                        confusing the race with the individual, or vice versa. What a race may do,
                        and what man may, are two very different things. The race, representing the
                        totality of active creations and pushed on by dynamic forces from below, may
                        be, and in so far as one can guess is, a huge success. The God or force or
                        forces using man in various aspects here and now (two billion men at the
                        present moment) may be and no doubt is finding self-expression through and
                        in him and may well be tremendously satisfied with the result. But in what
                        way does that, or can it, add to the comfort or bliss of the particular
                        individual? Endlessly repeated, an oyster-like copy of every other man that
                        has ever been, a mere minute portion of some <pb id="VAA2441-254" n="245"/>
                        thing the significance or import of which he can not even surmise. And
                        within the race itself one need only think of the various typespreacher,
                        actor, lawyer, doctor, merchant, thief, writer, poetic, artist,
                        prize-fighter, all very much alike and all repeated and repeated ad
                        infinitumto see how impossible the idea of individuality is. The very idea
                        of extreme individuality, even under the most special and favored
                        circumstances, is seen to be all but an impossibility. We are at best, even
                        in our arts and highest forms of special adaptations, copies of things which
                        are and have been as common as pig-tracksgenerals, philosophers, statesmen,
                        society grande dames and the like not excepted. Over and over and over we
                        appear, one and all, even our exact gestures, smiles, glances. Who has not
                        seen it in so short a space as three generations? And we speak of
                        individuality, of special destinies!</p>
                    <p>Herein lies the pathos, and this is the outstanding fact, that man is
                        essentially a creation or mechanism, accidental or not as you wish, of a
                        force or forces which in so far as any one can determine is or are, far more
                        than he in his wildest flights of fancy suspects, the thing which he most
                        craves to be, individual, enduring, but of which he is only a part and of
                        which he is constantly seeking more<hi rend="i">life</hi>. The thing which
                        makes and repeats over and over ad infinitum and <hi rend="i">is</hi> two
                        billions of men, or anything else into which it chooses to form itself, may
                        be thought of as having life, personality, success and the like, but as for
                        individual man or any of its minute atoms! Indeed man might as well think of
                        the minute atoms of his internal mechanism as having success, fame, a great
                        life or future, as himself. His day, like theirs, is measured by a minute
                        fraction of time and labor and energy, and so is nothing. Quite obviously
                        there is something which is to man what man in his entirety as an individual
                        is to the least ion or molecule of his inner cosmos: a thing of so vast a
                        magnitude comparatively as to be as far outside his reckoning as must he be
                        to the ion of his inner body. And as for size or force and import, that <pb
                            id="VAA2441-255" n="246"/> which creates him is as far above him as he
                        is above the ion. Indeed, although man, in his capacity or proportion as an
                        individual and as contrasted with the least of the electrons of his being,
                        is beyond computation for size, yet viewed again in contrast with his
                        external world he sinks into a mere fumbling, briefly-ended mote and tool.
                        Like the ion of his inner cosmos, in this vast etheric or ionic something
                        which is outside of him and which we see blazing as worlds or suns or
                        existing as immeasurable space, he is too minute and too brief be discussed.
                        Even the great earth which he treads with much pride is to this external
                        thing quite as minute as man&apos;s electron is to him; and yet his
                        relationship even to this is almost as nothing. For on this so minute thing
                        which, side-really speaking, is as nothing, he appears nevertheless,
                        insectwise, by the billion every forty (or whatever the average life of man
                        may be) years, to say nothing of innumerable other forms which have the ion
                        or the molecule as the base of their material presence or structure. Still
                        he permits himself to believe that he is something, and in facing all has
                        the stupendous or fortunate ignorance to write himself down as Lord, Master,
                        Great Guider of Things Terrestrial!</p>
                    <p>One of the things which might modify this supreme romantic estimate of
                        himself, if such a thing were either desirable or possible, would be an even
                        slightly technical examination of the process by which he arrives, as well
                        as the extreme simplicity of the mechanical and chemical formula by which,
                        throughout endless ages, he and all his fellows have been created. There is
                        no longer any vast mystery about it; we are even getting relatively close to
                        the secret, or could if we were permitted to go on undisturbed for a period
                        by wars, let us say, or religious and educational illusions and furies (put
                        forward by what? How brought about?), a persistent inherent, mass opposition
                        to thought and change in man himself. What subtle force ever invented that
                        as a race quieter?</p>
                    <p>As biologists and anthropologists present man and his allied <pb
                            id="VAA2441-256" n="247"/> species, the original type structure on which
                        all are more or less modeled is not so wonderful: two eyes, two ears, two
                        nostrils, two feet and two hands or four feet, two of them antecedents of
                        the present hands; or two feet and two wings, the latter successors of
                        former feet; a lung or air-breathing system, not unlike that of any tree or
                        plant; a root or arterial system, modified to meet various conditions and
                        situations as in birds, fishes, moles; a nervous or sensory system of an
                        allied characterno marked diversity in anything indeed, and all brought
                        about by the inescapable chemical and physical reactions and compulsions of
                        seemingly blind forces, as Crile and Loeb have shown. Even now chemists and
                        physicists are at work upon the balances and equations involved in the
                        mechanical and chemical construction of man, the leverage by which he moves,
                        the combinations which control his form or aspect, as well as the chemical
                        combinations which can induce motion or self-propulsion. Even as to his
                        so-called thought how close are the Behaviorisis to the material mechanics
                        which produce it? His thoughts also are apparently little more than
                        compelled reactions of one chemical upon another which he can no more escape
                        than can he his form or motions. The one unsolved mystery apparently is why
                        a machine so easily made and controlled should be able to speculate as to
                        the reason for his being or to worry over it.</p>
                    <p>And yet just here another interesting fact stands out, and that is that
                        whether or not he is a machine, Nature, or his Creator, appears to be quite
                        definitely opposed to his finding out about himself or even to his delving
                        into the matter, and throughout recorded science there is no evidence of the
                        least willingness on the part of Nature or the life constructing forces to
                        yield a single fact of any kind without a struggle. Man has fumbled and
                        stumbled, dying by billions in one erroneous way, or another, until at last,
                        by mere chance apparently, he has stumbled upon one helpful fact or another.
                        It is as if the fable of prometheus or that other of Adam and Eve were true.
                        The <pb id="VAA2441-257" n="248"/> seekers after knowledge of any kind have
                        almost invariably been fought or their work brought to nothing, and even
                        where man has apparently proven victorious or where he has seemingly been
                        aided only that has been yielded which has tended to further him as an
                        ignorant and yet useful machine, never as a thinker. No one who has tended
                        to throw a clear light on the internecine struggles of Nature Herself, Her
                        cruelties and brutalities, has prospered. If one doubts this he has only to
                        consider the fumbling, haphazard progress of man, his warring notions as to
                        his source and import, his strange aberrant evolution and persistent and
                        discouraging hindrances cast in the way of his intellectual evolution; i.
                        e., the rise of impossible and even ridiculous leaders and religious
                        theoriesChristianity, Shintoism, Mohammedismand the arrival of such dark
                        figures as Attila (self-styled &quot;the scourge of God&quot;),
                        Alaric, and Mohammed with his houris&apos; dream, upon the scene of
                        fairly acceptable in tellectual conditions. The deaths of endless prying
                        inventors, their pursuit by the religionists in darker ages, the periodic
                        rise of isms and world-sweeping folderol, political and other notions, all
                        seem to point to but one thing: Nature&apos;s indifference if not
                        opposition to man&apos;s tendency to develop intelligence and desire to
                        knowif such a thing can be assumed, for cannot be proved. For since when has
                        the dulness of the mass or man, his ignorance or indifference, apparently
                        calculated and conditional, not stood their ground against the overtures of
                        intelligence, science, the arts, philosophy? Nothing flourishes on earth so
                        well as vain theory. Energetic thought is all but taboo. False dreams and
                        false hopes are invariably encouraged by apparently some chemical or
                        mechanical condtion in the so-called brain of man himself. It is scarcely so
                        much that he dare not as that he cannot.</p>
                    <p>And if he should but stop to consider this cloak-and-suitmodel repetition of
                        himself previously suggested, this system or pattern after which he and all
                        the endless decillions which have preceded and will follow him are made, do
                        you suppose he <pb id="VAA2441-258" n="249"/> could exact anything which
                        suggested individuality or personal persistence as a spirit or
                        thoughtself-generated thought-out of it? Is one button wiser or much more
                        important than any other, or at all more likely to outlast another
                        spiritually? Is it in any way essential that it should? The original model
                        for the button might be important, but as for the endless copies! Indeed in
                        the whole program of repetition, in so far as man or any of the animals or
                        insects or of matter itself is concerned, there is but one ray of light or
                        hope, and that is that the ion or electron of which all and everything
                        appears to be composed may after all be the only true base or unit of
                        expression of the so-called controlling spirit or force or forces of life,
                        not the various contesting combinations of them, and that this ionic sea or
                        mass, while controlled by the necessity of division and recombination, if it
                        wishes to express itself at all (&quot;The Kinetic Theory,&quot; J.
                        C. Vogt), is still so large and so involute in its creative processes as to
                        be necessarily more or less indifferent to any form of ionic self-expression
                        or combination that might occur under or with it. So that the mere fact that
                        groups or volumes of itself (ions) should combine for any purpose or
                        generate themselves into any special forms of life (via combination, of
                        course)suns, planets, animals, races, nations, and their special
                        developments againmight be to it a matter of absolutely no consequence. What
                        matter if the electrons of some minute part of itself should organize and
                        set up some special sun or planet or race of individuals, so long as they
                        did not prove troublesome to the rest of the ionic sea? Supposing there are
                        vast galaxies of self-generated suns in spaceendless space, composed of but
                        a part of the total ionic massso long as they are a mere negligible nothing
                        to the totality of enduring force; what of it? If such were the case it is
                        entirely conceivable that anything might arise for a time, any system of
                        suns or race-life on suns or planets, and also the domination of one
                        organized group of ions over another, but all subject nevertheless in the
                        course of time and according to some <pb id="VAA2441-259" n="250"/>
                        equational and inescapable law to the totality of primary ionic or universal
                        force.</p>
                    <p>In that case such a statement as occurs in Genesis iii. 5, would be plain
                        enough. Some self-generated combination of ions looking upon itself as a
                        creator in its own right (for a period anyhow), and having sub-invented man
                        for some purpose of its own, self-expression or comfort, or the use of other
                        enslaved ions to do its bidding, might say just that (&quot;For God doth
                        know,&quot; etc.); and it would be true.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand man, via the force of the numbers of the ions collected
                        within himself, his race, and by degrees so gaining in numbers, and so power
                        or intelligence equal to that of the ions which had originally enslaved him,
                        might rise and question of this other elemental ionic combination its right
                        to lordship over him. And again, by reason of <hi rend="i">laissez
                            faire</hi> conditions which apparently hold throughout all Nature and
                        force, he would then be able to overthrow this higher ionic combination and
                        so set up a lordship of his ownas in some ways even now he appears to be
                        doing. For one need only observe his growing command of machinery and the
                        apparently indifferent streams of ionic energy everywhere moving, upon the
                        backs of which or to the Streams of which he attaches his wires and dynames
                        and engines and permits them to do a part of his work for him, in order to
                        see how this might be. For if we are not an illustration of one ionic
                        combination using another, what are we? And if that which is above us is not
                        a combination of ions using us, what is it? Science has no other answer. At
                        the same time, of course, man would be fought, as apparently he is being
                        fought now, attacked and delayed by the powers which hitherto have made and
                        are still using him. In that case the remarks of Jehovah in Genesis would be
                        explicable enough.</p>
                    <p>And I here venture this prediction, based on this idea, that in case man is
                        ever capable of awaking from his dream of spiritual enslavement and
                        considers the higher creative reality which makes suns and his own immediate
                        God as well, and <pb id="VAA2441-260" n="251"/> sees also that he is the
                        victim of a purely gratuitous overlord-ship of which he is no more than a
                        hypnotic victim, he may well be able to invent crawling and winged things
                        with some primary system of nervous response and intelligence, quite as he
                        was invented in the first place, which will serve him in some dull, hopeless
                        way, just as he himself now serves a higher power. Already he has invented
                        most complicated machinery, and what else may he not invent? For ions are
                        ions, wherever found, in whatever form of life, amoeba, or man or sun, and
                        they are everywhere. Obviously they may not rule save in combination and by
                        force, one combined group seizing on other uncombined and therefore helpless
                        ions so to do, and is that not our method in all phases of life here on
                        earth now? But once the ions of men finding themselves in combination, by
                        whatsoever process contrived, it may not be so easy longer to control them.
                        Rebellions may occur, and probably will. The great thing seems to be to get
                        enough of them in combination. Time perhaps is the great factor in all these
                        things. At the same time it might be true, and at present so appears, that
                        the generative group of ions which evolved man and all of his so-called
                        superior combinations and results here, might be so jealous of its own
                        creative skill in this respect that, seeing man or his ionic content
                        attempting to gain knowledge of how to proceed and do, it might at once set
                        out to undo him. The fable of Prometheus and of Adam and Eve may not be so
                        impossible, after all. Yet should his &quot;God&quot; not be able to
                        completely destroy him he may yet well imitate his Creator and create.</p>
                    <p>But will he be allowed so to do?</p>

                    <head>LIFE, ART AND AMERICA</head>
                    <p>I DO not pretend to speak with any historic or sociologic knowledge of the
                        sources of the American ethical, and there-fore critical, point of view,
                        though I suspect the origin, but I am at least convinced that, whatever its
                        source or sense, it does not accord with the facts of life as I have noted
                        or experienced them. To me the average or somewhat standardized American is
                        an odd, irregularly developed soul, wise and even froward in matters of
                        mechanics, organizations and anything that relates to technical skill in
                        connection with material things, but absolutely devoid of true spiritual
                        insight, correct knowledge of the history of literature or art, and confused
                        by and mentally lost in or overcome by the multiplicity of the purely
                        material and inarticulate details by which he finds himself surrounded.</p>
                    <p>As a boy in the small towns of the middle West I had no slightest opportunity
                        to get a correct or even partially correct estimate of what might be called
                        the mental A B abs of life. I knew nothing of history, and there was not a
                        book in any of the schools which I attended, labeled either history or
                        science or art, containing the least suggestion of the rationale which I
                        subsequently came to feel to be relatively true, or at least acceptable to
                        me. If I remember correctly, in the history of the world which was labeled
                        Swinton&apos;s, the defeat of Napoleon, not his career, was pointed cut
                        as having had a great moral if not Christian value to the world. His end on
                        St. Helena, not the Code Napoleon or the hieratic and ultra-economic
                        arrangement of his material forces, was supposed to have achieved something
                        for society! Similarly Socrates and his death were descanted upon as having
                        almost a religious if not a Christian <pb id="VAA2441-262" n="253"/> import.
                        His death was painted as having been brought about by his low private deeds,
                        not his higher moral views. The true significance of the man as illustrated
                        by the exact details of his life were utterly ignored.</p>
                    <p>Because my father was a Catholic and I was baptized in that faith, I was
                        supposed to accept all the dogma, as well as the legends, of the Church as
                        true. In the life about me I saw flourishing the Methodist, the Baptist, the
                        United Brethren, the Christian, the Congregationalist, the what-not
                        churches, each representing, according to its adherents, the exact historic
                        and truthful development and interpretation of life or the world. As a
                        fourteen- or fifteen-year-old boy I listened to sermons on hell, where it
                        was, and what was the nature of its torments. As rewards for imaginary good
                        behavior I have been given colored picture cards containing exact
                        reproductions of heaven! Every newspaper that I have ever read, or still
                        read, has had an exact code of morals by the light of which one may detect
                        at once Mr. Bad Man and Mr. Good Man and so save oneself from the
                        machinations of the former! The books which I was advised to read, and for
                        the neglect of which I was frowned upon, were of that nave character known
                        as pure. One should read only good bookswhich meant of course books from
                        which any reference to sex had been eliminated, and what followed as a
                        natural consequence was that all intelligent interpretation of character and
                        human nature was immediately discounted.</p>
                    <p>A picture of a nude or partially nude woman was sinful; a statue equally so.
                        The dance in our home and our town was taboo. The theater was an institution
                        which led to crime, the saloon a center of low, even bestial vices. The
                        existence of such a thing as an erring or fallen woman, let alone a house of
                        prostitution, was a crime, scarcely a fact to be considered. There were
                        forms and social appearances which we were taught to wear, quite as one
                        wears a suit of clothes. One had to go to church on Sunday whether one
                        wished to or not. It was considered <pb id="VAA2441-263" n="254"/> good
                        business, if you please, to be connected with some religious organization;
                        and, by the same token, this commercialized religiosity was transmuted into
                        glistening virtue. We were taught persistently to shun most human
                        experiences as either dangerous or degrading or destructive. The less you
                        knew about life the better; the more you knew about the fictional heaven and
                        hell ditto. People walked about in a kind of sanctified maze or dream,
                        hypnotized or self-hypnotized by an erratic and impossible theory of human
                        conduct which had grown up heaven knows where or how, and had finally cast
                        its amethystine spell over all America, if not over all the world.</p>
                    <p>Now I have no particular quarrel with this save that it is so impossible, so
                        inane. In my day there were apparently no really bad men who were not known
                        as such to all the world, or at least quickly detected, and few if any good
                        men who were not sufficiently rewarded by the glorious fruits of their good
                        deeds here and now! Successmere commercial successwas in its way all but
                        synonymous with greatness. Positively, and I stake my solemn word on this,
                        until I was between seventeen and eighteen I had scarcely begun to suspect
                        any other human being of harboring the erratic and sinful thoughts which
                        occasionally flashed through my own mind.</p>
                    <p>At that time I was just beginning to suspect that some of the things which
                        had been laid down to me by one authority and another were not true. All
                        so-called good men were not necessarily good, I was beginning to suspect,
                        and all bad men not hopelessly bad. There were things in cities and town
                        which, as I was coming to see, did not accord with the theories of the
                        particular realm from which I had sprung and seemed to indicate another kind
                        of human being, different from the type among which I had been raised. My
                        mother, as I even then saw, admire her as I might, was a mere woman, not an
                        angel; my father a mere, mere crotchety man. My sisters and brothers were
                        individuals such as I soon began to and were breasting the stormy waters of
                        life outside, and not very different from <pb id="VAA2441-264" n="255"/> all
                        other brothers and sisters, not perfect souls set apart from life and happy
                        in the contemplation of each other&apos;s perfections. In short, I was
                        beginning to find the world a seething, stormy, bitter, gay, rewarding and
                        destroying realm, in which the strong and the subtle and the charming and
                        the magnetic were apt to be victors, and the weak and the homely and the
                        ignorant and the dull were apt to be deprived of any interesting share, not
                        because of any inate depravity but rather because of the lacks by which they
                        were handicapped and which they could not possibly overcome.</p>
                    <p>And there were other phases which previously I had scarcely suspected. The
                        race was to the swift and the battle to the strong. All great successes, as
                        I was beginning to discover for myself, were relatively gifts, the teachings
                        of the self helpers and virtue mongers to the contrary notwithstanding.
                        Artists, singers, actors, policemen, statesmen, generals, were born and not
                        made. Sunday-school maxims, outside of the narrowest precincts, did not
                        apply. People might preach one thing on Sunday or in the bosom of their
                        families or in the meeting-places of conventional social groups, but they
                        did not practice them except under compulsion, particularly in the marts of
                        trade and exchange. Mark the phrase &quot;under compulsion.&quot; I
                        admit a vast compulsion which has nothing to do with the individual desires
                        or tastes or impulses of individuals. That compulsion springs from the
                        settling processes of forces which we do not in the least understand, over
                        which we have no control and in whose grip we are as grains of dust or sand,
                        blown hither and thither, for what purpose we cannot even suspect. Politics,
                        as I found in working as a newspaper man, was a low mess; religion, both as
                        to its principles and its practitioners, a ghastly fiction based on sound
                        and fury, signifying nothing; trade was a seething war in which the less
                        subtle and the less swift or strong went under, while the more cunning
                        succeeded; the professions were largely gathering-places of weaklings, <pb
                            id="VAA2441-265" n="256"/> mediocrities or mercenaries, to be bought by,
                        or sold to, the highest bidder.</p>
                    <p>The individual, as I found, was trying to do one thing: make himself happy
                        principally; life was plainly trying to do another, or at least what it was
                        doing involved no great concern for the welfare of any particular
                        individual. He might live, he might die; he might be well fed, he might be
                        hungry; he might, accidentally or by taking thought, ally himself with
                        successful movements, or he might inherently, by some incapacity or fatality
                        of disposition, involve himself in the drifts toward failure; he might be
                        weak, he might be strong; he might be wise, he might be dull or narrow. Life
                        in the large thrashing sense in which we see it to move about us cared no
                        whit for him. Why so many failures? I was constantly asking myself; so many
                        early deaths, so many accidents, crass and unexplained? Why so many fires?
                        So many cyclones? So many destroying epidemics? So many breaks in health or
                        in trade or by reason of vice or crime or mere increasing age and mood? So
                        many, many individuals going down into the limbo of nothingness or failure,
                        so few attaining to that vast and lonesome supremacy which all were seeking?
                        Why? Why? I persistently asked myself; and I have yet to find the answer in
                        any current code of morals or ethics or the dogma of any religion.</p>
                    <p>If you should chance to consult a Methodist, a Baptist, a Presbyterian, a
                        Lutheran, or any other current American sectarian, on this subject you would
                        find (which after all is a dull thing to point out at this day and date)
                        that his conception of the things which he sees about him is bounded by what
                        he was taught in his Sunday School or his church, or what he has stored up
                        or gathered from the conventions of his native town. (His native town! Kind
                        heaven!) And although the world has stored up endless treasures in
                        chemistry, sociology, history, philosophy, still the millions and millions
                        who tramp the streets and occupy the stores and fill the highways and byways
                        and the fields and the tenements have no faintest knowledge of this, <pb
                            id="VAA2441-266" n="257"/> or of anything else that can be said to be
                        intellectually &quot;doing.&quot; They live in theories and isms,
                        and under codes dictated by a church or a state or an order of society which
                        has no least regard for or relationship to their natural mental development.
                        The darkest side of democracy, like that of autocracy, is that it permits
                        the magnetic and the cunning and the unscrupulous among the powerful
                        individuals to sway vast masses of the mob, not so much to their own
                        immediate destruction as to the curtailment of their natural privileges and
                        the ideas which they should be allowed to entertain if they could think at
                        alland incidentally to the annoying and sometimes undoing of individuals who
                        have the truest brain interests of the race at heart: vide Giordano Bruno!
                        Jan Huss! Savonarola! Tom Paine! Walt Whitman! Edgar Allan Poe!</p>
                    <p>For after all the great business of life and mind is life. We are here, I
                        take it, not merely to moon and vegetate, but to do a little thinking about
                        this state in which we find ourselves, or at least to try. It is perfectly
                        legitimate, all priests and theories and philosophies to the contrary, to go
                        back, in so far as we may, to the primary sources of thought, i. e., the
                        visible scene, the actions and thoughts of people, the movements of Nature
                        and its chemical and physical subtleties, in order to draw original and
                        radical conclusions for ourselves. The great business of the individual, if
                        he has any time after struggling for life and a reasonable amount of
                        entertainment or sensory satiation, should be this very thing. He should
                        question the things he seesnot some things, but everythingstand, as it were,
                        in the center of this whirling storm of contradiction which we know as life,
                        and ask of it its source and its import. Else why a brain at all? If only
                        one could induce or enable a moderate number of the individuals who pass
                        this way and come no more apparently to pause and think about life and take
                        an individual point of view, the freedom and individuality and interest of
                        the world might be greatly enhanced. We complain of the world as dull. If it
                        is so, lack of thinking by individuals <pb id="VAA2441-267" n="258"/> is the
                        reason. But to ask the poor, half-equipped mentality of the mass to think,
                        to be individualwhat an anachronism! You might as well ask of a rock to move
                        or a tree to fly.</p>
                    <p>Here in America, by reason of an idealistic Constitution which is largely a
                        work of art and not a workable system, you see a nation dedicated to
                        so-called intellectual and spiritual freedom, but actually devoted with an
                        almost bee-like industry to the gathering and storing and articulation and
                        organization and use of purely material things. In spite of all our
                        base-drum announcement of our servitude to the intellectual ideals of the
                        world (copied mostly, by the way, from England) no nation has ever
                        contributed less, philosophically or artistically or spiritually, to the
                        actual development of the intellect and the spirit. We have invented many
                        things, it is true, which have relieved man from the crushing weight of a
                        too-grinding toil, and this perhaps may be the sole mission of America in
                        the world and the universe, its destiny, its end. Personally I think it is
                        not a half bad thing to have done; the submarine and the flying machine and
                        the armored dreadnought, no less than the sewing-machine and the cotton-gin
                        and the binder and the reaper and the cash register and the trolley-car if
                        not the telephone, may prove in the end, or perhaps already have proved, as
                        significant in breaking the chains of the physical and mental slavery of man
                        as anything else. I do not know.</p>
                    <p>One thing I do know is that America seems profoundly interested in these
                        things, to the exclusion of anything else. It has no time, you might almost
                        say, no taste, to stop and contemplate life in the large, from an artistic
                        or a philosophic point of view. Yet after all, when all the machinery for
                        lessening man&apos;s burdens has been invented and all the safeguards
                        for his preservation completed and possibly shattered by forces too deep or
                        superior for his mechanical cunning, may not a phrase, a line of poetry, or
                        a single act of some half-forgotten tragedy be all that is left of what we
                        now see or dream of as materially perfect? For is it not thought alone, of
                        many <pb id="VAA2441-268" n="259"/> famous and powerful things that have
                        already gone, that endures?a thought most often conveyed by art as a
                        medium?</p>
                    <p>But let me not become too remote or fine-spun in my conception of the
                        ultimate significance of art itself. The point which I wish to make is just
                        this: that in a land so devoted to the material, although dedicated by its
                        Constitution to the ideal, the condition of intellectual freedom, let alone
                        art, is certainly anomalous. Your trade and your trust builder, most
                        obviously dominant in America at this time, is of all people most
                        indifferent to, or most unconscious of, the ultimate and pressing claims of
                        mind and spirit as expressed by art. If you doubt this you have only to look
                        about you to see for what purposes, to what end, the increment of men of
                        wealth and material power in America is most devoted. Stuffy, tasteless
                        houses crowed with stuffy, tasteless antiques, safety deposit vaults stuffed
                        with securities, the having and holding of purely material values always. In
                        proof of which I may add that we have something like twenty-five hundred
                        colleges and schools and institutions of various kinds, largely furthered by
                        the money of American men of wealth, and all presumably devoted to the
                        development of the mental equipment of man (or so we are told), yet nearly
                        all set with flinty firmness against anything which is related to truly
                        radical investigation, or thought, or action, or art. The inculcation of
                        morality and patriotism are even now laid down as the true task and province
                        of the so-called schools of higher learning by the educators themselves, or
                        at least the presidents of most of the leading institutionsnot the getting
                        of knowledge at any cost, patriotic or other.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact, in spite of the American Constitution and the American
                        oratorical address on all and sundry occasions, the average American school,
                        college, university, institution, is as much against the development of the
                        individual, in true sense of that word, as any sect or religion. What it
                        really wants is not an individual but an automatic copy of some altruistic
                        and impossible ideal, which has been formulated <pb id="VAA2441-269" n="260"
                        /> here or elsewhere under the domination of Christianity or some other ism.
                        I defy you to read any American college or university prospectus or address
                        or plea which concerns the purposes or ideals of these institutions and not
                        agree with me. They are not after individuals; they are after types or
                        schools of individuals, all to be very much alike, all to be like
                        themselves. And what type? Listen. I know of an American college professor
                        in one of our successful State universities who had this to say of the male
                        graduates of his institution, after having watched the output for a number
                        of years: &quot;They are all right, quite satisfactory as machines for
                        the production of material wealth or for the maintenance of certain forms of
                        professional skill, but as for ideas of their own or being creators or men
                        with the normal impulses and passions of manhood they do not fulfill the
                        requisite in any respect. They are little more than types, machines, made in
                        the image and likeness of their college. They do not think; they cannot,
                        because they are held hard and fast by the iron band of convention. They are
                        afraid to think. They are moral young beings, Christian beings, model
                        beings, but they are not men in the creative sense, and the large majority
                        will never do a thing other than work for a corporation in a routine
                        unindividual way, unless by chance or necssity the theories and the
                        conventions imposed or generated by they training and surroundings are
                        broken, and they become free, independent, self-thinking
                        individuals.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In this connection I might say I know of one woman&apos;s college, an
                        American institution of the highest standing, which since its inception has
                        sent forth into life some thousands of graduates and post-graduates to
                        battle life as they may for individual supremacy or sensory comfort. They
                        are (or were) supposed to be individuals capable of individual thought,
                        procedure, invention, development; yet out of all of them not one has even
                        entered upon any creative or artistic labor of any kind. Not one. (Write me
                        for the name of the college, if you wish.) There is not a chemist, a
                        physiologist, a botanist, <pb id="VAA2441-270" n="261"/> a biologist, an
                        historian, a philosopher, an artist, of any kind or repute among them; not
                        one. They are secretaries to corporations, teachers, missionaries, college
                        librarians, educators in any of the scores of pilfered meanings that may be
                        attached to that much abused word. They are curators, directors, keepers.
                        They are not individuals in the true sense of that word; they have not been
                        taught to think; they are not free. They do not invent, lead, create; they
                        only copy or take care of, yet they are graduates of this college and its
                        theory, mostly ultra conventional, or, worse yet, anemic, and glad to wear
                        its collar, to clank the chains of its ideas or idealsautomatons in a social
                        scheme whose last and final detail was outlined to them in the classrooms of
                        their alma mater. That, to me, is one phase, amusing enough, of intellectual
                        freedom in America.</p>
                    <p>But the above is a mere detail in any chronicle or picture of the social or
                        intellectual state of the United States, Turn, for instance, if you will, to
                        the legislative and judicial phases of our Governmentthose grand realms in
                        which only statesmen and judical students of our economic and social
                        condition are supposed to move and rule, and what do we find?</p>
                    <p>As long ago as 1875 Ernst Haeckel, the eminent German scientist, complained
                        that the judges and legislatures of his day and country had &quot;but a
                        superficial acquaintance with that chief and peculiar object of their
                        activitythe human organism and most important function, the human
                        mind,&quot; and that they had no time for anything save &quot;an
                        exhaustive study of beer and wine and the noble art of fencing.&quot; If
                        that could be said of intellectual Germany in his day how much more and
                        worse could be judicated of the American jurist and legislator in America
                        to-day. The shabby mess which finance and trade rivalries make of our laws
                        and our halls of legislationthe mental equipment of the average politician,
                        his henchmen, the leglator and the judgethe hall boys of finance, and at the
                        same time of religious and therefore arbitrary moral dogma which they have
                        become, the petty ignoramuses we see on every hand <pb id="VAA2441-271"
                            n="262"/> legislating for the people or interpreting the laws once they
                        are thus formulated! Haeckel wrote sadly of the judges and law enactors in
                        his day: &quot;No one can maintain that their condition to-day is in
                        harmony with our advanced knowledge of this world&quot;and, certainly,
                        in America to-day, fifty years later, not a week passes in which we do not
                        read of legislative deeds and legal decisions which make a thinking man
                        sigh. Consider the slavish acceptance of religious and moral and financial
                        dictation from self-interested and equally ignorant people, the running here
                        and there to find what is temporarily expedientwhat will satisfy or quiet
                        the public for an hour; what will keep them from losing their petty jobsby
                        the politicians and legislators and so-called statesmen and judges; the
                        complete ignorance of every congressman and senator and state legislator and
                        judge and lawyer as to the commonest facts of biology, psychology,
                        sociology, economics, and history! One president, Rooseyelt, admitted that
                        he could in no way understand economics. Yet once the average country or
                        city law student has mastered a few hundred paragraphs of law he is ready to
                        hire out to the nearest corporation, to legislate for the people, to prefix
                        &quot;Hon.&quot; to his name and set up in business as a judge or a
                        statesman.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, and in the very teeth of all this, no country in the
                        world, at least none that I know anything about, has such a peculiar, such a
                        seemingly fierce determination, to make the Ten Commandments work. It would
                        be amusing if it were not pitiful, their faith in these binding religious
                        ideals. I have never been able to make up my whether this springs from the
                        zealotry of the Puritans landed at Flymouth Rock, or whether it is
                        indigenous to the soil (which I doubt when I think of the Indians who
                        preceded the white), or whether it is a product of the Federal Constitution,
                        compounded by such idealists as Paine and Jefferson and Franklin and the
                        more or less religious and political dreamers of the pre-Constitutional
                        days. Certain it is that no such profound <pb id="VAA2441-272" n="263"/>
                        moral idealism animated the French in Canada, the Dutch in New York, the
                        Swedes in New Jersey, or the mixed French and English in the extreme South
                        and New Orleans.</p>
                    <p>The first shipload of white women ever brought to America was sold, almost at
                        so much a pound. They were landed at Jamestown. The basis of all the first
                        large fortunes was laid, to speak plainly, in graftthe most outrageous
                        concessions obtained abroad. The history of our relations with the American
                        Indians is sufficient to lay any claim to financial or moral virtue or worth
                        in the white men who settled this country. We debauched, then robbed and
                        murdered them; there is no other conclusion to be drawn from the facts
                        covering that relationship as set down in any history worthy the name. As
                        regards the development of our land, our canals, our railroads, and the vast
                        organizations supplying our present-day necessities, their history is a
                        complex of perjury, robbery, false witness, extortion, and indeed every
                        crime to which avarice, greed and ambition are heir. If you do not believe
                        this, examine the various congressional and State legislative investigations
                        which have been held on an average of every six months since the Govenmant
                        was founded, and see for yourself. The cunning and unscruplousness of
                        American brains can be matched against any the world has ever known, not
                        even excepting the English.</p>
                    <p>But an odd thing in connection with this financial and social criminality is
                        that it has been consistently and regularly accompanied, outwardly at least,
                        by a religious and a sex-puri-tanism which would be scarcely believable if
                        it were not true. I do not say that the robbers and thieves who did so much
                        to build up our great commercial and social structures were in themselves
                        always religious or puritanically moral from the sex point of view, although
                        in regard to the latter they most frequently made a show of so being; but I
                        do say that the communities and the States and the nation in which they were
                        committing their depredations have been individually and collectively. in so
                        far as the written, printed and acted word are <pb id="VAA2441-273" n="264"
                        /> concerned, most loud in their pretensions. Why? I have a vague feeling
                        that it is the American of Anglo-Saxon origin only who has been most vivid
                        in his excitement over religion and morals where the written, printed, acted
                        or painted word was concerned, yet who at the same time, and perhaps for
                        this very reason, was failing or deliberately refusing to see the contrast
                        which his ordinary and very human actions presented to all this. Was he a
                        hypocrite? Is he one?</p>
                    <p>Your American of Anglo-Saxon or other origin is actually no better,
                        spiritually or morally, than any other creature of this earth, be he Turk or
                        Hindu or Chinese, except from a materially constructive or wealth-breeding
                        point of view, but for some odd reason he thinks he is. The only real
                        difference is that, cast out or spewed out by conditions over which he had
                        no control elsewhere, he chanced to fall into a land overflowing with milk
                        and honey. Nature in America was, and still is, kind to the lorn foreigner
                        seeking a means of subsistence, and he seems to have immediately attributed
                        this to three things: First, his inherent capacity to dominate and control
                        wealth; second, the especial favor of God to him; third, to his superior and
                        moral state (due, of course, to his possession of wealth). These three
                        things, uncorrected as yet by any great financial pressure or any great
                        natural or world catastrophe, have served to keep the American in his highly
                        romantic state of self-deception. He still thinks that he is a superior
                        spiritual and moral being, infinitely better than the creatures of any other
                        land, and nothing short of a financial cataclysm, which will come with the
                        pressure of population on resources, will convince him that he is not. But
                        that he will yet be convinced is a certainty. You need no fear. Leave it to
                        Nature.</p>
                    <p>One of the interesting phases of this puritanism or phariseeism is his
                        attitude toward women and their morality and their purity. If ever a people
                        has refined eroticism to a greater degree than the American I am not aware
                        of it. Owing to a theory of the doctrinaire acceptance of the Mary legend
                        possibly <pb id="VAA2441-274" n="265"/> (Mary-olotry, no less), the good
                        American, capable of the same gross financial crimes previously indicated,
                        has been able to look upon most women, but more particularly those above him
                        in the social scale, as considerably more than human angelic, no less, and
                        possessed of qualities the like of which are not to be found in any
                        breathing being, man, woman, child or animal. It matters not that his cities
                        and towns, like those of any other nation, are rife with sex; that in each
                        one are specific and often large areas devoted to Eros or Venus. While
                        maintaining them he is still blind to their existence or import. He or his
                        boys or his friends gobut</p>
                    <p>Only a mentally one-sided nature or race such as the Anglo-Saxon could have
                        built upon any such asinine theory as this. One would suppose that as they
                        did, so they would have the courage to say, or at least cease this endless
                        pother as to superior virtue. But no. The purity, the sanctity, the
                        self-abnegation, the delicacy of women in Americahow these qualities have
                        been exaggerated and dinned into our ears, until at last the average scrubby
                        non-reasoning male, quite capable of visiting the gardens of Venus or taking
                        a girl off the street, is no more able to clearly visualize the creature
                        before him than he is the central wilds of Africa which he has never seen. A
                        princess, a godness, a divine mother or creative principle, all the virtues,
                        all the perfections, no vices, no weaknesses, no errorssome such hodge-podge
                        as this has come to be the average Anglo-Saxon, or at least American,
                        conception of the average American woman. I do not say that a portion of
                        this illusion is not valuable, but as it stands now she is too good to be
                        true, a paragon, a myth! Actually, she doesn&apos;t exist at all as he
                        has been taught to imagine her. She is nothing more than a two-legged biped
                        like the rest of us, but in consequence of this delusion sex itself, being a
                        violation of this paragon, has become a crime. We enter upon the earth, it
                        is true, in a none too artistic manner (conceived in iniquity and born in
                        sin, is the Biblical phrasing of it), but all this has long since been <pb
                            id="VAA2441-275" n="266"/> glozed over, ignored, and to obviate its
                        brutality as much as possible the male has been called upon to purify
                        himself in thought and deed, to avoid all private speculation as to women
                        and his relationship to them, and, much more than that, to avoid all public
                        discussion, either by word of mouth or the printed page.</p>
                    <p>To think of women or to describe them, especially in our printed or publicly
                        uttered word, as anything less than the paragon previously commented upon
                        has become, by this process, not only a sin but a shameful infraction of the
                        moral code. Women are now so good, the sex relationship so vile a thing that
                        to think of the two at once is not to be thought of. They are supposed to
                        have no connection. We must move in a mirage of illusion; we must trample
                        fact underfoot and give fancy, in the guise of our so-called better natures,
                        free rein. How this must affect or stultify the artistic and creative
                        faculties of the race itself must be plain, yet that is exactly where we
                        stand to-day, ethically and spiritually, in regard to sex and women, and
                        that is what is the matter with American social life, letters and art.
                        Imagine a puritan or a moralist attempting anything in art, which is nothing
                        if not a true reflection, emotional and intellectual, of insight into life!
                        Imagine! And contrast this moral or art narrowness with the
                        American&apos;s commercial or financial or agricultural freedom and
                        sense, and note the difference. In regard to all the latter he is cool,
                        skeptical, level-headed, understanding, natural, consequently well-developed
                        in those fields; in regard to this other he is disillusioned, theoretic,
                        religious. In consequence he has no power, except for an occasional
                        individual who may rise in spite of these untoward conditions (to be frowned
                        upon), to understand, much less picture, life as it really is. Artistically,
                        intellectually, philosophically we are weaklings; financially and in all
                        ways commercial we are very powerful. So one-sided has been our development
                        that in this latter respect we are almost giants. Strange, almost fabulous
                        creatures have been developed <pb id="VAA2441-276" n="267"/> here by this
                        process, men so singularly devoid of a rounded human nature that they have
                        become freaks in the matter of money-getting. I refer to Rockefeller, Gould,
                        Sage, Vanderbilt the first, H. H. Rogers, Carnegie, Frick.</p>
                    <p>America I fear can be most aptly pictured as the land of Bottom the Weaver;
                        and by Bottom I mean the tradesman or manufacturer who by reason of his
                        enthusiasm for the sale of paints or powder or threshing machines or coal
                        has accumulated wealth, and in consequence and by reason of the haphazard
                        privileges of democracy, has strayed into a position of counsellor, or even
                        dictator, not in regard to the things about which he might readily be
                        supposed to know, but about the many things about which he would be much
                        more likely not to know: art, science, philosophy, morals, public policy in
                        general. You recall Bottom, of course, in &quot;A Midsummer
                        Night&apos;s Dream,&quot; unconscious of his furry ears and also of
                        the fact that he does not know how to play the lion&apos;s part; that it
                        is more difficult than mere roaring. Here he is now, in America, enthroned
                        as a lion, and in his way he is an epitome of the Anglo-Saxon temperament.
                        Bottom is so wise in his own estimation. He never once suspects his furry
                        ears or that he is not a perfect actor in the role of the lionor, if you
                        will take it for what it is meant, the arts. He is just a dull weaver
                        really, made by this dream of our Constitution (&quot;an exposition of
                        sleep&quot; come upon him) into a roaring lionin his own estimation. No
                        one must say that Bottom is not; he will be driven out of the country,
                        deported or exiled. No one must presume to practice the arts save as Bottom
                        understands them. If you do, presto, there is his henchman Comstock and all
                        Com-stockery to take you into custody. Men who have come here from foreign
                        shores (England excepted) have been amazed at Bottom&apos;s ears and his
                        presumption in passing upon what is a lion&apos;s part in life. Indeed
                        he is the Anglo-Saxon temperament personified. He is convinced that liberty
                        was not made for Oberon or Peaseblossom or Cobweb or Mustard, but for <pb
                            id="VAA2441-277" n="268"/> bishops and executives and wholesale grocers
                        and men who have become vastly rich canning tomatoes or selling oil. The
                        great desire of Bottom is for all of us to have furry ears and long, and to
                        believe that he is the greatest actor in the world. He is bewildered by a
                        world that will not play Pyramus his way. Quince, Snug, Flute, Snout and
                        Starveling (all those who came over with him in the Mayflower) agree that he
                        is a great actor, but there are others, and Bottom is convinced that these
                        others are in error, trying to wreck that dream, the American Constitution,
                        which brought this &quot;exposition of sleep&quot; upon him and made
                        him into a lion, &quot;marvelous furry about the face&quot; and with
                        great ears.</p>
                    <p>Alas, alas! for art in America. It has a hard, stubby row to hoe.</p>
                    <p>But my quarrel is not with America as a comfortable commercial and
                        industrious atmosphere in which to move and have one&apos;s being, but
                        largely because it is no more than that, because it tends to become a dull,
                        conventionalized, routine, material world, duller even than its reputed
                        mother, sacred England. We are drifting, unless most of the visible signs
                        are deceiving, into the clutches of a commercial oligarchy whose mental
                        standards outside of trade are so puerile as to be scarcely worth
                        discussing. Contemplate, if you please, what has happened to one of the
                        shibboleths or bulwarks of our sacred liberties and intellectual freedom, i.
                        e., the newspaper, under the dominance of trade. Look at it. I have not the
                        time here to set forth seriatim all the charges that have been made, and in
                        the main thoroughly substantiated, against the American newspaper; but
                        consider for yourself the newspapers which you know and read. How much, I
                        ask you, if you are in trade, do the newspapers you read know about trade?
                        How far could you follow their trade judgment or understanding? And if you
                        are a member of any profession, how much reported professional knowledge or
                        news, as presented by a newspaper, can you rely on? If a newspaper reported
                        a professional man&apos;s <pb id="VAA2441-278" n="269"/> judgment or
                        dictum in regard to any important professional fact, how fully would you
                        accept it without other corroborative testimony?</p>
                    <p>You are a play-goer: do you believe the newspaper dramatic critics? You are a
                        student of literature: do you accept the mouthings of their literary critics
                        or even look to them for advice? You are an artist or a lover of art: do you
                        follow the newspapers for anything more than the barest intelligence as to
                        the whereabouts of anything artistic? I doubt it. And in regard to politics,
                        finance, social movements and social affairs, are they not actually the
                        darkest, the most misrepre-sentative, frequently the most biased and
                        malicious guides in the world of the printed word? Newspaper criticism, like
                        newspaper leadership, has long since come to be looked upon by the informed
                        and intelligent as little more than the mouth-ings or bellowings of
                        mercenaries or panderers to trade; or, worse still, rank incompetents. The
                        newspaper man, <hi rend="i">per se</hi>, either does not know or cannot help
                        himself. The newspaper publisher is very glad of this and uses his half
                        intelligence or inability to further his own interests. Politicians,
                        administrations, department stores, large interests and personalities of
                        various kinds use or control or compel newspapers to do their bidding. This
                        is a severe indictment to make against the press in general, but is it not
                        literally true?</p>
                    <p>Take again the large, almost dominant religious and commercial organizations
                        of America. What relationship, if any, do they bear to a free mental
                        development, a subtle understanding, art or life in its poetic or tragic
                        moulds, its drift, its character? Would you personally look to the Methodist
                        or the Presbyterian or the Catholic or the Baptist church to further
                        individualism, or freedom of thought, or directness of mental action, or art
                        in any form? Do not they really ask of all their adherents that they lay
                        aside this freedom in favor of the reported word or dictum of a fabled, a
                        non-historic, an imaginary ruler of the universe? Think of it! And they are
                        among the <pb id="VAA2441-279" n="270"/> powerful, constructive and
                        controlling elements in governmentin this government, to be
                        accuratededicated and presumably devoted to individual liberty, not only of
                        so-called conscience, but of constructive thought and art.</p>
                    <p>And our large corporations, with their dominant and controlling captains of
                        industry so-called; what about their relationship to individuality, the
                        freedom of the individual to think for himself, to grow mentally? Take, for
                        instance, the tobacco trust, the oil trust, the milk trust, the coal trustin
                        what way do you suppose they help? Are they actively seeking a better code
                        of ethics, a wider historic or philosophic perspective, a more delicate art
                        perception for the individual, or are they definitely and permanently
                        concerned with the customary bludgeoning tactics of trade, piling up
                        fortunes out of which they are to be partially bled later by pseudo art
                        collectors and swindling dealers in antiques and so-called historic art and
                        literature? Of current life and its accomplishments, what do they actually
                        know? Yet this is a democracy. Here, as in no other realm of the world, the
                        individual is supposed to be permitted, even compelled, to seek his own
                        material and mental salvation as best he may. Yet one trouble with a
                        democracy, in so far as art and individual intelligence is concerned, as
                        opposed to an autocracy with a line of titled idlers, is that the latter
                        permits at least the gift of leisure and art indulgence to a few and there
                        usually is a central force or group to foster art, to secure letters and art
                        in their inalienable rights, to make of superior thought a noble and a
                        sacred thing. I am not saying that democracy will not yet produce such a
                        central force or group. I believe it may or can. It is entirely possible
                        that when the time arrives it may prove to be better than any form of
                        hereditary autocracy. But I am talking about the mental, the social, the
                        artistic condition of America as it is to-day.</p>
                    <p>To me it is a thing for laughter, if not for tears; one hundred and twenty
                        million Americans, rich (a fair percentage of them, anyhow) beyond the
                        dreams of avarice, and scarcely <pb id="VAA2441-280" n="271"/> a sculptor, a
                        poet, a singer, a novelist, an actor, a musician, worthy the name. One
                        hundred and forty years (almost two hundred, counting the Colonial days) of
                        the most prosperous social conditions, a rich soil, incalculable deposits of
                        gold, silver and precious and useful metals and fuels of all kinds, a land
                        amazing in its mountains, its streams, its valley prospects, its
                        wealth-yielding powers, and now its tremendous cities and far-flung
                        facilities for travel and tradeand yet contemplate it. Artists, poets,
                        thinkers, where are they? Has it produced a single philosopher of the first
                        ranka Spencer, a Nietzsche, a Schopenhauer, a Kant? Do I hear some one
                        offering Emerson as an equivalent? Or James? Has it produced a historian of
                        the force of either Macaulay or Grote or Gibbon? A novelist of the rank of
                        Turgenev, de Maupassant or Flaubert? A scientist of the standing of Crookes
                        or Rentgen or Pasteur? A critic of the insight and force of Taine,
                        Sainte-Beuve or the de Goncourts? A dramatist the equivalent of Ibsen,
                        Chekhov, Shaw, Hauptmann, Brieux? An actor, since Booth, of the force of
                        Coquelin, Sonnenthal, Forbes-Robertson or Sarah Bernhardt? Since Whitman,
                        one poet: Edgar Lee Masters. In painting a Whistler, an Inness, a Sargent.
                        Who else? (And two of these shook the dust of our shores forever.)
                        Inventors, yes; by the hundreds, one might almost say thousands; some of
                        them amazing enough, in all conscience, world figures, and enduring for all
                        time. But of what relationship to art, the supreme freedom of the mind?</p>
                    <p>The most significant, and to me discouraging, manifestation in connection
                        with the United States to-day is the tendency to even narrower and more
                        puritanic standards than have obtained in the past. I am constantly
                        astonished by the thousands of men, exceedingly capable in some mechanical
                        or narrow technical sense, whose world or philosophic vision is that of a
                        child. As a nation we accept and believe navely in such impossible things. I
                        am not thinking alone of the primary tenets of all religions, which are
                        manifestly based on nothing <pb id="VAA2441-281" n="272"/> at all and which
                        millions of Americans, along with the humbler classes of other countries,
                        accept, but rather of those sterner truths which life itself teaches: the
                        unreliability of human nature; the crass chance which strikes down and
                        destroys our finest dreams; the fact that man in all his relations is
                        neither good nor evil, but both. The American, by some hocus pocus of
                        atavism, has seemingly borrowed or retained from English lower middle-class
                        puritans all their folderol notions about making human nature perfect by
                        fiat or edictthe written word, as it were, which goes with all religions.
                        So, although by reason of the coarsest and most brutal methods we as a
                        nation have built up one of the most interesting and domineering oligarchies
                        in the world, we are still not aware of the fact.</p>
                    <p>All men, in the mind of the unthinking American, are still free and equal.
                        They have in themselves certain inalienable rights; what they are when you
                        come to test them no human being can discover. Life here, as elsewhere,
                        comes down to the brutal methods of Nature itself. The rich strike the poor
                        at every turn; the poor defend themselves and further their lives by all the
                        tricks which stark necessity can conceive. No inalienable right keeps the
                        average cost of living from rising steadily, while most of the salaries of
                        our idealistic Americans are stationary. No inalienable right has ever yet
                        prevented the strong from tricking or browbeating the weak. And although by
                        degrees the average American is feeling more and more keenly the sharpening
                        struggle for existence, yet his faith in his impossible ideals is as fresh
                        as ever. God will save the good American and seat him at His right hand on
                        the Golden Throne.</p>
                    <p>With one hand the nave American takes and executes with all the brutal
                        insistence of Nature itself; with the other he writes glowing platitudes
                        concerning brotherly love, virtue, purity, truth, etc., etc, A part of this
                        right or left hand tendency, as the case may be, is seen in the constant
                        desire of the American to reform something. No country in the world, not <pb
                            id="VAA2441-282" n="273"/> even England, the mother of folderol reforms,
                        is so prolific in these frail ventures as this great country of ours. In
                        turn we have had campaigns for the reform of the atheist, the drunkard, the
                        lecher, the fallen woman, the buccaneer financier, the drug fiend, the
                        dancer, the theatergoer, the reader of novels, the wearer of low-neck
                        dresses and surplus jewelryin fact every taste and frivolity, wherever
                        sporadically it has chanced to manifest itself with any interesting human
                        force. Your reformer&apos;s idea is that any human being, to be a
                        successful one, must be a pale spindling sprout, incapable of any vice or
                        crime. And all the while the threshing sea of life is sounding in his ears!
                        The thief, the lecher, the drunkard, the fallen woman, the greedy, the
                        inordinately vain, as in all ages past, pass by his door and are not the
                        whit less numerous for the unending campaigns which have been launched to
                        save them. In other words, human nature is human nature, but your American
                        cannot be made to believe it.</p>
                    <p>Personally my quarrel is with America&apos;s quarrel with original
                        thought. It is so painful to me to see one after another of our alleged
                        reformers tilting Don Quixote-like at the giant windmills of fact. We are to
                        have no pictures which the puritan and the narrow, animated by an obsolete
                        dogma, cannot approve of. We are to have no theaters, no motion pictures, no
                        books, no public exhibitions of any kind, no speech even, which will in any
                        way contravene his limited view of life. Finally we even contrived a
                        President who was to have no more war! A few years ago It was the humble
                        dealer in liquor whose life was anathematized and whose property was
                        descended upon with torch, axe and bomb. A little later, our cities growing
                        and the sections devoted to the worship of Venus becoming more manifest, the
                        Vice Crusader was bred, and we now have the spectacle of whole areas of
                        fallen women scattered to the four winds and allowed to practice separately
                        what they cannot do collectively. Also came Mr. Comstock, vindictive,
                        persistent, and with a nose and taste for the profane and erotic such <pb
                            id="VAA2441-283" n="274"/> as elsewhere has not been equaled since.
                        Pictures, books, the theater, the dance, the studioall came under his
                        watchful eye. During the twenty or thirty years in which he acted as a
                        United States Postoffice Inspector he was, because of his dull charging
                        against things which he did not understand, never out of the white light of
                        publicity which he so greatly craved. One month it would be a novel by
                        d&apos;Annunzio; another, a set of works by Balzac or de Maupassant,
                        found in the shade of some grovelly bookseller&apos;s shop; the humble
                        photographer attempting a nude; the painter who allowed his reverence for
                        Raphael to carry him too far; the poet who attempted a recrudescence of Don
                        Juan in modern iambics, was immediately seized upon and hauled before an
                        equally dull magistrate, there to be charged with his offense and to be
                        fined accordingly. All this is being continued with emphasis.</p>
                    <p>Then came the day of the armed White Slave Chasers, and now no American city
                        and no backwoods Four Corners, however humble, is complete without a vice
                        commission of some kind, or at least a local agent or representative charged
                        with the duty of keeping the art, the literature, the press and the private
                        lives of all those at hand up to that standard of perfection which only the
                        dull can set for themselves. When the White Slave question was at its
                        whitest heat the problem of giving expression to its fundamental aspects was
                        divided between raiding plays which attempted to show the character of the
                        crime in too graphic a manner, and licensing those which appealed to the
                        intelligence of those who were foremost in the crusade. Thus we had the
                        spectacle of an uncensored, but nevertheless approved, ten-reel film showing
                        more details of the crime and better methods of securing white slaves than
                        any other production of the day, running undisturbed to packed houses all
                        over the country; while two somewhat more dramatic but far less effective
                        distributors of information via plays were successfully harried from city to
                        city and finally withdrawn.</p>
                    <p>Shakespeare has been ordered from the schools in some of <pb id="VAA2441-284"
                            n="275"/> the States. A production of &quot;Antony and
                        Cleopatra&quot; has been raided in Chicago. Japanese prints of a high
                        art value, intended for the seclusion of a private collection, have been
                        seized and the most valuable of them destroyed. By turns, an artistic
                        fountain to Heine in New York, loan exhibits of paintings in Denver, Kansas
                        City and elsewhere, scores of books by Stevenson, James Lane Allen, Frances
                        H. Burnett, have been attacked, not only, as in the case of the latter, with
                        the airy weapons of the law, but in the case of the former with actual axes.
                        A male dancer of repute and some artistic ability has been raided publicly
                        by the Vice Crusaders for his shameless exposure of his person! No play, no
                        picture, no book, no public or private jubilation of any kind is complete
                        any more without its vice attack.</p>
                    <p>To me this sort of thing is dull and bespeaks the low state to which our
                        mental activities have fallen. When it comes to the matter of serious
                        letters it is the worst. In New York a literary region of terror has been
                        and is now being attempted. The publisher of Freud&apos;s
                        &quot;Leonardo&quot; is warned before he brings it out that he will
                        be prosecuteda work that probably has no more defect than that of being
                        intelligent and true. Similarly, Mr. Przybyszewski&apos;s &quot;Homo
                        Sapiens,&quot; a by no means pornographic work, was at once seized on
                        its appearance and the publishers frightened into withdrawing it. This was
                        true of &quot;Hagar Revelly,&quot; &quot;Tess of the
                        d&apos;Urbevilles,&quot; &quot;Sapho,&quot; &quot;Jude
                        the Obscure,&quot; &quot;Rose of Dutchers Cooley,&quot;
                        &quot;A Lady of Quality,&quot; &quot;A Summer in
                        Arcady,&quot; and scores of others. Imagine banning a book like
                        &quot;A Summer in Arcady&quot; from the public libraries! Even
                        &quot;The Sexual Question&quot; by the eminent August Forel has been
                        banned and of course all of Kraft-Ebling (Freud and Ellis are sold only on
                        the written order of a doctora mental prescription as it were). Think of
                        itthe work of a scientist of Freud&apos;s attainments!</p>
                    <p>This sort of interference with serious letters and science is to me the worst
                        and most corrupting form of espionage which <pb id="VAA2441-285" n="276"/>
                        is conceivable to the human mind. It plumbs the depths of ignorance and
                        intolerance; if not checked it can and will ***dani initiative and
                        inspiration at the source. Life, if it is anything at all, is a thing to be
                        observed, studied, interpreted. We cannot know too much about it because as
                        yet we know nothing. It is our one great realm of discovery. The artist, if
                        left to himself, may be safely trusted to observe, synchronize and
                        articulate human knowledge in the most comprehensive form. Human nature will
                        seek and have what it needs, the vice crusaders to the contrary
                        notwithstanding. There is no compulsion on any one to read; one must pay to
                        do so. What is more, one must have taste inherently to select, a brain and a
                        heart to understand. With all these safeguards and a double score of capable
                        critics in every land to praise or blame, what need really is there for a
                        censor, or a dozen of them, each far less fitted than any of the working
                        critics to indulge his personal predilection and opposition, and to appeal
                        to the courts if he is disagreed with?</p>
                    <p>Personally I rise to protest. I look on this interference with serious art
                        and thought and serious minds as an outrage. I fear for the ultimate
                        intelligence of America, which in all conscience, judged by world standards,
                        is low enough. Now comes a band of wasp-like censors to put the finishing
                        touches on a literature and an art that has struggled all too feebly as it
                        is. Poe, Hawthorne, Whitman and Thoreau, each in turn was the butt and jibe
                        of unintelligent Americans, until by now we are well nigh the laughing-stock
                        of the world. Where is it to end? When will we lay aside our
                        swaddling-clothes, enforced on us by ignorant, impossible puritans and their
                        uneducated followers, and stand up free-thinking men and women? Life is to
                        be learned as much from books and art as from itselfalmost more so, in my
                        judgment. Art is the stored honey of the human soul, gathered on wings of
                        misery and travail. Shall the dull and the self-seeking and the
                        self-advertising close this store on the groping human mind?</p>

                    <p>EDITORIAL NOTE: The following manuscript, recovered from one of the
                        twenty-seven tombs of Federated Chairmen of the Post Federated Period of
                        World Republics, A.D. 27603923, recently discovered in the debris centers of
                        Exomia, Domas and Polos (Central Asia), plainly refers to some annual
                        festival or period of congratulation which, according to the historian,
                        Ruffstuff, who seems to have flourished toward the close of that period when
                        the great Asiatic and American world floods (the shifting of the boundaries
                        of the Pacific) ended the old order, was apparently held, first, at some
                        point in Central South Africa; later in Middle Western North America, as the
                        then continents were called. The author or dramatist, Theobromo, plainly of
                        some period later than that of the Post Federated, when literature of all
                        sorts, owing to the religious viewpoint of the Federation, was non-existent,
                        was plainly familiar with records of this great court or festival, now
