                    <p>When Caroline Meeber boarded the afternoon train for Chicago, her total
                        outfit consisted of a small trunk, a cheap imitation alligator-skin satchel,
                        a small lunch in a paper box, and a yellow leather snap purse, containing
                        her ticket, a scrap of paper with her sister&apos;s address in Van Buren
                        Street, and four dollars in money. It was in August, 1889. She was eightern
                        years of age, bright, timid, and full of the illusions of ignorance and
                        youth. Whatever touch of regret at parting characterised her thoughts, it
                        was certainly not for advantages now being given up. A gush of tears at her
                        mother&apos;s farewell kiss, touch in her throat when the cars clacked
                        by the flour mill where her father worked by the day, a pathetic sigh as the
                        familiar green environs of the village passed in review, and the threads
                        which bound her so lightly to girlhood and home were irretrievably
                        broken.</p>
                    <p>To be sure there was always the next station, where one might descend and
                        return. There was the great city, bound more closely by these very trains
                        which came up daily. Columbia City was not so very, far away, even once she
                        was in Chicago. What, pray, is a few hoursa few hundred miles? She looked at
                        the little slip bearing her sister&apos;s address and wondered. She
                        gazed at the <pb id="VAA2423-008" n="2"/> green landscape, now passing in
                        swift review, until her swifter, thoughts replaced its impression with vague
                        conjectures of what Chicago might be.</p>
                    <p>When a girl leaves her home at eighteen, she does one of two things. Either
                        she falls into saving hands and becomes better, or she rapidly assumes the
                        cosmopolitan standard of virtue and becomes worse. Of an intermediate
                        balance, under the circumstances, there is no possibility. The city has its
                        cunning wiles, no less than the infinitely smaller and more human tempter.
                        There are large forces which allure with all the soulfulness of expression
                        possible in the most cultured human. The gleam of a thousand lights is often
                        as effective as the persuasive light in a wooing and fascinating eye. Half
                        the undoing of the unsophisticated and natural mind is accomplished by
                        forces wholly superhuman. A blare of sound, a roar of life, a vast array of
                        human hives, appeal to the astonished senses in equivocal terms. Without a
                        counsellor at hand to whisper cautious interpretations, what falsehoods may
                        not these things breathe into the unguarded ear! Unrecognised for what they
                        are, their beauty, like music, too often relaxes, then weakens, then
                        perverts the simpler human perceptions.</p>
                    <p>Caroline, or Sister Carrie, as she had been half affectionately termed by the
                        family, was possessed of a mind rudimentary in its power of observation and
                        analysis. Self-interest will, her was high, but not strong. It was,
                        nevertheless, her guiding characteristic. Warm with the fancies of youth,
                        pretty with the insipid prettiness of the formative period, possessed of a
                        figure promising eventual shapeliness and an eye alight with certain native
                        intelligence, she was a fair example of the middle American classtwo
                        generations removed from the emigrant. Books were beyond her
                        interestknowledge a sealed book. In the intuitive graces she was still
                        crude. She <pb id="VAA2423-009" n="3"/> could scarcely toss her head
                        gracefully. Her hands were almost ineffectual. The feet, though small, were
                        set flatly. And yet she was interested in her charms, quick to understand
                        the keener pleasures of life, ambitious to gain in material things. A
                        half-equipped little knight she was, venturing to reconnoitre the mysterious
                        city and dreaming wild dreams of some vague, far-off supremacy, which should
                        make it prey and subjectthe proper penitent, grovelling at a
                        woman&apos;s slipper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That,&quot; said a voice in her ear, &quot; is one of the
                        prettiest little resorts in Wisconsin.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it?&quot; she answered nervously.</p>
                    <p>The train was just pulling out of Waukesha. For some time she had been
                        conscious of a man behind. She felt him observing her mass of hair. He had
                        been fidgetting, and with natural intuition she felt a certain interest
                        growing in that quarter. Her maidenly reserve, and a certain sense of what
                        was conventional under the circumstances, called her to forestall and deny
                        this familiarity, but the daring and magnetism of the individual, born of
                        past experiences and triumphs, prevailed. She answered.</p>
                    <p>He leaned forward to put his elbows upon the back of her seat and proceeded
                        to make himself volubly agreeable.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, that is a great resort for Chicago people. The hotels are
                        swell. You are not familiar with this part of the country, are
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, I am,&quot; answered Carrie. &quot; That is, I
                        live at Columbia City. I have never been through here, though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And so this is your first visit to Chicago,&quot; he
                        observed.</p>
                    <p>All the time she was conscious of certain features out of the side of her
                        eye. Flush, colourful cheeks, a light moustache, a grey fedora hat. She now
                        turned and looked upon him in full, the instincts of self-protection and
                        coquetry mingling confusedly in her brain.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t say that,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-010" n="4"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he answered, in a very pleasing way and with an
                        assumed air of mistake, &quot;I thought you did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Here was a type of the travelling canvasser for a manufacturing housea class
                        which at that time was first being dubbed by the slang of the day
                        &quot;drummers.&quot; He came within the meaning of a still newer
                        term, which had sprung into general use among Americans in 1880, and which
                        concisely expressed the thought of one whose dress or manners are calculated
                        to elicit the admiration of susceptible young womena
                        &quot;masher.&quot; His suit was of a striped and crossed pattern of
                        brown wool, new at that time, but since become familiar as a business suit.
                        The low crotch of the vest revealed a stiff shirt bosom of white and pink
                        stripes. From his coat sleeves protruded a pair of linen cuffs of the same
                        pattern, fastened with large, gold plate buttons, set with the common yellow
                        agates known as &quot;cat&apos;s-eyes.&quot; His fingers bore
                        several ringsone, the ever-enduring heavy sealand from his vest dangled a
                        neat gold watch chain, from which was suspended the secret insignia of the
                        Order of Elks. The whole suit was rather tight-fitting, and was finished off
                        with heavy-soled tan shoes, highly polished, and the grey fedora hat. He
                        was, for the order of intellect represented, attractive, and whatever he had
                        to recommend him, you may be sure was not lost upon Carrie, in this, her
                        first glance.</p>
                    <p>Lest this order of individual should permanently pass, let me put down some
                        of the most striking characteristics of his most successful manner and
                        method. Good clothes, of course, were the first essential, the things
                        without which he was nothing. A strong physical nature, actuated by a keen
                        desire for the feminine, was the next. A mind free of any consideration of
                        the problems or forces of the world and actuated not by greed, but an
                        insatiable love of variable pleasure. His method was <pb id="VAA2423-011"
                            n="5"/> always simple. Its principal element was daring, backed, of
                        course, by an intense desire and admiration for the sex. Let him meet with a
                        young woman once and he would approach her with an air of kindly
                        familiarity, not unmixed with pleading, which would result in most cases in
                        a tolerant acceptance. If she showed any tendency to coquetry he would be
                        apt to straighten her tie, or if she &quot;took up&quot; with him at
                        all, to call her by her first name. If he visited a department store it was
                        to lounge familiarly over the counter and ask some leading questions. In
                        more exclusive circles, on the train or in waiting stations, he went slower.
                        If some seemingly vulnerable object appeared he was all attentionto pass the
                        compliments of the day, to lead the way to the parlor car, carrying her
                        grip, or, failing that, to take a seat next her with the hope of being able
                        to court her to her destination. Pillows, books, a footstool, the shade
                        lowered; all these figured in the things which he could do. If, when she
                        reached her destination he did not alight and attend her baggage for her, it
                        was because, in his own estimation, he had signally failed.</p>
                    <p>A woman should some day write the complete philosophy of clothes. No matter
                        how young, it is one of the things she wholly comprehends. There is an
                        indescribably faint line in the matter of man&apos;s apparel which
                        somehow divides for her those who are worth glancing at and those who are
                        not. Once an individual has passed this faint line on the way downward he
                        will get no glance from her. There is another line at which the dress of a
                        man will cause her to study her own. This line the individual at her elbow
                        now marked for Carrie. She became conscious of an inequality. Her own plain
                        blue dress, with its black cotton tape trimmings, now seemed to her shabby.
                        She felt the worn state of her shoes.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-012" n="6"/>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s see,&quot; he went on, &quot;I know quite a
                        number of people in your town. Morgenroth the clothier and Gibson the dry,
                        goods man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, do you?&quot; she interrupted, aroused by memories of
                        longings their show windows had cost her.</p>
                    <p>At last he had a clew to her interest, and followed it deftly. In a few
                        minutes he had come about into her seat. He talked of sales of clothing, his
                        travels, Chicago, and the amusements of that city.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you are going there, you will enjoy it immensely. Have you
                        relatives?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am going to visit my sister,&quot; she explained.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You want to see Lincoln Park,&quot; he said, &quot;and
                        Michigan Boulevard. They are putting up great buildings there. It&apos;s
                        a second New Yorkgreat. So much to see theatres, crowds, fine housesoh,
                        you&apos;ll like that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a little ache in her fancy of all he described. Her insignificance
                        in the presence of so much magnificence faintly affected her. She realised
                        that hers was not to be a round of pleasure, and yet there was something
                        promising in all the material prospect he set forth. There was something
                        satisfactory in the attention of this individual with his good clothes. She
                        could not help smiling as he told her of some popular actress of whom she
                        reminded him. She was not silly, and yet attention of this sort had its
                        weight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will be in Chicago some little time, won&apos;t
                        you?&quot; he observed at one turn of the now easy conversation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Carrie vaguelya flash vision
                        of the possibility of her not securing employment rising in her mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Several weeks, anyhow,&quot; he said, looking steadily into her
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>There was much more passing now than the mere words indicated. He recognised
                        the indescribable thing <pb id="VAA2423-013" n="7"/> that made up for
                        fascination and beauty in her. She realised that she was of interest to him
                        from the one standpoint which a woman both delights in and fears. Her manner
                        was simple, though for the very reason that she had not yet learned the many
                        little affectations with which women conceal their true feelings. Some
                        things she did appeared bold. A clever companionhad she ever had onewould
                        have warned her never to look a man in the eyes to steadily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do you ask?&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m going to be there several weeks. I&apos;m
                        going to study stock at our place and get new samples. I might show you
                        &apos;round.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know whether you can or not. I mean I
                        don&apos;t know whether I can. I shall be living with my sister,
                        and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, if she minds, we&apos;ll fix that.&quot; He took out
                        his pencil and a little pocket note-book as if it were all settled.
                        &quot;What is your address there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She fumbled her purse which contained the address slip.</p>
                    <p>He reached down in his hip pocket and took out a fat purse. It was filled
                        with slips of paper, some mileage books, a roll of greenbacks. It impressed
                        her deeply. Such a purse had never been carried by any one attentive to her.
                        Indeed, an experienced traveller, a brisk man of the world, had never come
                        within such close range before. The purse, the shiny tan shoes, the smart
                        new suit, and the <hi rend="i">air</hi> with which he did things, built up
                        for her a dim world of fortune, of which he was the centre. It disposed her
                        pleasantly toward all he might do.</p>
                    <p>He took out a neat business card, on which was engraved Bartlett, Caryoe
                        &amp; Company, and down in the left-hand corner, Chas. H. Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s me,&quot; he said, putting the card in her hand
                        and <pb id="VAA2423-014" n="8"/> touching his name. &quot;It&apos;s
                        pronounced Drew-eh. Our family was French, on my father&apos;s
                        side.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at it while he put up his purse. Then he got out a letter from a
                        bunch in his coat pocket. &quot;This is the house I travel
                        for,&quot; he went on, pointing to a picture on it, &quot;corner of
                        State and Lake.&quot; There was pride in his voice. He felt that it was
                        something to be connected with such a place, and he made her feel that
                        way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is your address?&quot; he began again, fixing his pencil
                        to write.</p>
                    <p>She looked at his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Carrie Meeber,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;Three hundred
                        and fifty-four West Van Buren Street, care S. C. Hanson.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He wrote it carefully down and got out the purse again.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll be at home if I come around Monday
                        night?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think so,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>How true it is that words are but the vague shadows of the volumes we mean.
                        Little audible links, they are, chaining together great inaudible feelings
                        and purposes. Here were these two, bandying little phrases, drawing purses,
                        looking at cards, and both unconscious of how inarticulate all their real
                        feelings were. Neither was wise enough to be sure of the working of the mind
                        of the other. He could not tell how his luring succeeded. She could not
                        realise that she was drifting, until he secured her address. Now she felt
                        that she had yielded somethinghe, that he had gained a victory. Already they
                        felt that they were somehow associated. Already he took control in directing
                        the conversation. His words were easy. Her scanner was relaxed.</p>
                    <p>They were nearing Chicago. Signs were everywhere numerous. Trains flashed by
                        them. Across wide stretches of flat, open prairie they could see lines of
                        telegraph poles stalking across the fields toward the great <pb
                            id="VAA2423-015" n="9"/> city. Far away were indications of suburban
                        towns, some big smoke-stacks towering high in the air.</p>
                    <p>Frequently there were two-story frame houses standing out in the open fields,
                        without fence or trees, lone outposts of the approaching army of homes.</p>
                    <p>To the child, the genius with imagination, or the wholly untravelled, the
                        approach to a great city for the first time is a wonderful thing.
                        Particularly if it be eveningthat mystic period between the glare and gloom
                        of the world when life is changing from one sphere or condition to another.
                        Ah, the promise of the night. What does it not hold for the weary! What old
                        illusion of hope is not here forever repeated! Says the soul of the toiler
                        to itself &quot;I shall soon be free. I shall be in the ways and the
                        hosts of the merry. The streets, the lamps, the lighted chamber set for
                        dining, are for me. The theatre, the halls, the parties, the ways of rest
                        and the paths of songthese are mine in the night.&quot; Though all
                        humanity be still enclosed in the shops, the thrill runs abroad. It is in
                        the air. The dullest feel something which they may not always express or
                        describe. It is the lifting of the burden of toil.</p>
                    <p>Sister Carrie gazed out of the window. Her companion, affected by her wonder,
                        so contagious are all things, felt anew some interest in the city and
                        pointed out its marvels.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is Northwest Chicago,&quot; said Drouet. &quot;This is
                        the Chicago River,&quot; and he pointed to a little muddy creek, crowded
                        with the huge masted wanderers from far-off waters nosing the black-posted
                        banks. With a puff, a clang, and a clatter of rails it was gone.
                        &quot;Chicago is getting to be a great town,&quot; he went on.
                        &quot;It&apos;s a wonder. You&apos;ll find lots to see
                        here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not hear this very well. Her heart was troubled by a kind of terror.
                        The fact that she was alone, away <pb id="VAA2423-016" n="10"/> from home,
                        rushing into a great sea of life and endeavour, began to tell. She could not
                        help but feel a little choked for breatha little sick as her heart beat so
                        fast. She half closed her eyes and tried to think it was nothing, that
                        Columbia City was only a little way off.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Chicago! Chicago!&quot; called the brakeman, slamming open the
                        door. They were rushing into a more crowded yard, alive with the clatter and
                        clang of life. She began to gather up her poor little grip and closed her
                        hand firmly upon her purse. Drouet arose, kicked his legs to straighten his
                        trousers, and seized his clean yellow grip.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose your people will be here to meet you?&quot; he said.
                        &quot;Let me carry your grip.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; she said. &quot;I&apos;d rather you
                        wouldn&apos;t. I&apos;d rather you wouldn&apos;t be with me when
                        I meet my sister.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; he said in all kindness.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll be near, though, in case she isn&apos;t here,
                        and take you out there safely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re so kind,&quot; said Carrie, feeling the
                        goodness of such attention in her strange situation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Chicago!&quot; called the brakeman, drawing the word out long.
                        They were under a great shadowy train shed, where the lamps were already
                        beginning to shine out, with passenger cars all about and the train moving
                        at a snail&apos;s pace. The people in the car were all up and crowding
                        about the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, here we are,&quot; said Drouet, leading the way to the
                        door. &quot;Good-bye, till I see you Monday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; she answered, taking his proffered hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Remember, I&apos;ll be looking till you find your
                        sister.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She smiled into his eyes.</p>
                    <p>They filed out, and he affected to take no notice of her. A lean-faced,
                        rather commonplace woman recognised Carrie on the platform and hurried
                        forward.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-017" n="11"/>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Sister Carrie!&quot; she began, and there was a
                        perfunctory embrace of welcome.</p>
                    <p>Carrie realised the change of affectional atmosphere at once. Amid all the
                        maze, uproar, and novelty she felt cold reality taking her by the hand. No
                        world of light and merriment. No round of amusement. Her sister carried with
                        her most of the grimness of shift and toil.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, how are all the folks at home?&quot; she began;
                        &quot;how is father, and mother?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie answered, but was looking away. Down the aisle, toward the gate
                        leading into the waiting-room and the street, stood Drouet. He was looking
                        back. When he saw that she saw him and was safe with her sister he turned to
                        go, sending back the shadow of a smile. Only Carrie saw it. She felt
                        something lost to her when he moved away. When he disappeared she felt his
                        absence thoroughly. With her sister she was much alone, a lone figure in a
                        tossing, thoughtless sea.</p>

                        labourers and clerks, men who had come, and were still coming, with the rush
                        of population pouring in at the rate of 50,000 a year. It was on the third
                        floor, the front windows looking down into the street, where, at night, the
                        lights of grocery stores were shining and children were playing. To Carrie,
                        the sound of the little bells upon the horse-cars, as they tinkled in and
                        out of hearing, was as pleasing as it was novel. She gazed into the lighted
                        street when Minnie brought her into the front room, and wondered at the
                        sounds, the movement, the murmur of the vast city which stretched for miles
                        and miles in every direction.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hanson, after the first greetings were over, gave Carrie the baby and
                        proceeded to get supper. Her husband asked a few questions and sat down to
                        read the evening paper. He was a silent man, American born, of a Swede
                        father, and now employed as a cleaner of refrigerator cars at cars at the
                        stock-yards. To him the presence or absence of his wife&apos;s sister
                        was a matter of indifference. Her personal appearance did not affect him one
                        way or the other. His observation to the point was concerning the chances of
                        work in Chicago.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a big place,&quot; he said. &quot;You can get
                        in somewhere in a few days. Everybody does.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-019" n="13"/>
                    <p>It had been tacitly understood beforehand that she was to get work and pay
                        her board. He was of a clean, saving disposition, and had already paid a
                        number of monthly instalments on two lots far out on the West Side. His
                        ambition was some day to build a house on them.</p>
                    <p>In the interval which marked the preparation of the meal Carrie found time to
                        study the flat. She had some slight gift of observation and that sense, so
                        rich in every womanintuition.</p>
                    <p>She felt the drag of a lean and narrow life. The walls of the rooms were
                        discordantly papered. The floors were covered with matting and the hall laid
                        with a thin rag carpet. One could see that the furniture was of that poor,
                        hurriedly patched together quality sold by the instalment houses.</p>
                    <p>She sat with Minnie, in the kitchen, holding the baby until it began to cry.
                        Then she walked and sang to it, until Hanson, disturbed in his reading, came
                        and took it. A pleasant side to his nature came out here. He was patient.
                        One could see that he was very much wrapped up in his offspring.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, now,&quot; he said, walking. &quot;There,
                        there,&quot; and there was a certain Swedish accent noticeable in his
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll want to see the city first, won&apos;t
                        you?&quot; said Minnie, when they were eating. &quot;Well,
                        we&apos;ll go out Sunday and see Lincoln Park.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie noticed that Hanson had said nothing to this. He seemed to be thinking
                        of something else.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I think I&apos;ll look
                        around to-morrow. I&apos;ve got Friday and Saturday, and it
                        won&apos;t be any trouble. Which way is the business part?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Minnie began to explain, but her husband took this part of the conversation
                        to himself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s that way,&quot; he said, pointing east.
                        &quot;That&apos;s east.&quot; Then he went off into the longest
                        speech he had yet indulged <pb id="VAA2423-020" n="14"/> in, concerning the
                        lay of Chicago. &quot;You&apos;d better look in those big
                        manufacturing houses along Franklin Street and just the other side of the
                        river,&quot; he concluded. &quot;Lots of girls work there. You could
                        get home easy, too. It isn&apos;t very far.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie nodded and asked her sister about the neighbourhood. The latter talked
                        in a subdued tone, telling the little she knew about it, while Hanson
                        concerned himself with the baby. Finally he jumped up and handed the child
                        to his wife.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve got to get up early in the morning, so I&apos;ll
                        go to bed,&quot; and off he went, disappearing into the dark little
                        bedroom off the hall, for the night.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He works way down at the stock-yards,&quot; explained Minnie,
                        &quot;so he&apos;s got to get up at half-past five.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What time do you get up to get breakfast?&quot; asked
                        Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;At about twenty minutes of five.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Together they finished the labour of the day, Carrie washing the dishes while
                        Minnie undressed the baby and put it to bed. Minnie&apos;s manner was
                        one of trained industry, and Carrie could see that it was a steady round of
                        toil with her.</p>
                    <p>She began to see that her relations with Drouet would have to be abandoned.
                        He could not come here. She read from the manner of Hanson, in the subdued
                        air of Minnie, and, indeed, the whole atmosphere of the flat, a settled
                        opposition to anything save a conservative round of toil. If Hanson sat
                        every evening in the front room and read his paper, if he went to bed at
                        nine, and Minnie a little later, what would they expect of her? She saw that
                        she would first need to get work and establish herself on a paying basis
                        before she could think of having company of any sort. Her little flirtation
                        with Drouet seemed now an extraordinary thing.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-021" n="15"/>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she said to herself, &quot;he can&apos;t come
                        here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She asked Minnie for ink and paper, which were upon the mantel in the
                        dining-room, and when the latter had gone to bed at ten, got out
                        Drouet&apos;s card and wrote him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I cannot have you call on me here. You will have to wait until you
                        hear from me again. My sister&apos;s place is so small.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She troubled herself over what else to put in the letter. She wanted to make
                        some reference to their relations upon the train, but was too timid. She
                        concluded by thanking him for his kindness in a crude way, then puzzled over
                        the formality of signing her name, and finally decided upon the severe,
                        winding up with a &quot;Very truly,&quot; which she subsequently
                        changed to &quot;Sincerely.&quot; She sealed and addressed the
                        letter, and going in the front room, the alcove of which contained her bed,
                        drew the one small rocking-chair up to the open window, and sat looking out
                        upon the night and streets in silent wonder. Finally, wearied by her own
                        reflections, she began to grow dull in her chair, and feeling the need of
                        sleep, arranged her clothing for the night and went to bed.</p>
                    <p>When she awoke at eight the next morning, Hanson had gone. Her sister was
                        busy in the dining-room, which was also the sitting-room, sewing. She
                        worked, after dressing, to arrange a little breakfast for herself, and then
                        advised with Minnie as to which way to look. The latter had changed
                        considerably since Carrie had seen her. She was now a thin, though rugged,
                        woman of twenty-seven, with ideas of life coloured by her
                        husband&apos;s, and fast hardening into narrower conception of pleasure
                        and duty than had ever been hers in a thoroughly circumscribed youth. She
                        had invited Carrie, not because she longed for her presence, but because the
                        latter was dissatisfied at home, and could probably get work and pay her
                        board here. She was pleased to see her in a way but reflected her <pb
                            id="VAA2423-022" n="16"/> husband&apos;s point of view in the matter
                        of work. Anything was good enough so long as it paidsay, five dollars a week
                        to begin with. A shop girl was the destiny prefigured for the newcomer. She
                        would get in one of the great shops and do well enough untilwell, until
                        something happened. Neither of them knew exactly what. They did not figure
                        on promotion. They did not exactly count on marriage. Things would go on,
                        though, in a dim kind of way until the better thing would eventuate, and
                        Carrie would be rewarded for coming and toiling in the city. It was under
                        such auspicious circumstances that she started out this morning to look for
                        work.</p>
                    <p>Before following her in her round of seeking, let us look at the sphere in
                        which her future was to lie. In 1889 Chicago had the peculiar qualifications
                        of growth which made such adventuresome pilgrimages even on the part of
                        young girls plausible. Its many and growing commercial opportunities gave it
                        widespread fame, which made of it giant magnet, drawing to itself, from all
                        quarters, the hopeful and the hopelessthose who had their fortune yet to
                        make and those whose fortunes and affairs had reached a disastrous climax
                        elsewhere. It was a city of over 500,000, with the ambition, the daring, the
                        activity of a metropolis of a million. Its streets and houses were already
                        scattered over an area of seventy-five square miles. Its population was not
                        so much thriving upon established commerce as upon the industries which
                        prepared for the arrival of others. The sound of the hammer engaged upon the
                        erection of new structures was everywhere heard. Great industries were
                        moving in. The huge railroad corporations which had long before recognised
                        the prospects of the place had seized upon vast tracts of land for transfer
                        and shipping purposes. Street-car lines had been extended far out into the
                        open country in anticipation of rapid growth. The city had <pb
                            id="VAA2423-023" n="17"/> laid miles and miles of streets and sewers
                        through regions where, perhaps, one solitary house stood out alonea pioneer
                        of the populous way to be. There were regions open to the sweeping winds and
                        rain, which were yet lighted throughout the night with long, blinking lines
                        of gas-lamps, fluttering in the wind. Narrow board walks extended out,
                        passing here a house, and there a store, at far intervals, eventually ending
                        on the open prairie.</p>
                    <p>In the central portion was the vast wholesale and shopping district, to which
                        the uninformed seeker for work usually drifted. It was a characteristic of
                        Chicago then, and one not generally shared by other cities, that individual
                        firms of any pretension occupied individual buildings. The presence of ample
                        ground made this possible. It gave an imposing appearance to most of the
                        wholesale houses, whose offices were upon the ground floor and in plain view
                        of the street. The large plates of window glass, gave to the ground floor
                        offices a distinguished and prosperous look. The casual wanderer could see
                        as he passed a polished array of office fixtures, much frosted glass, clerks
                        hard at work, and genteel business men in &quot;nobby&quot; suits
                        and clean linen lounging about or sitting in groups. Polished brass or
                        nickel signs at the square stone entrances announced the firm and the nature
                        of the business in rather neat and reserved terms. The entire metropolitan
                        centre possessed a high and mighty air calculated to overawe and abash the
                        common applicant, and to make the gulf between poverty and success seem both
                        wide and deep.</p>
                    <p>Into this important commercial region the timid Carrie went. She walked east
                        along Van Buren Street through a region of lessening importance, until it
                        deteriorated into a mass of shanties and coal-yards, and finally verged upon
                        the river. She walked bravely forward, led by an honest <pb id="VAA2423-024"
                            n="18"/> desire to find employment and delayed at every step by the
                        interest of the unfolding scene, and a sense of helplessness amid so much
                        evidence of power and force which she did not understand. These vast
                        buildings, what were they? These strange energies and huge interests, for
                        what purposes were they there? She could have understood the meaning of a
                        little stone-cutter&apos;s yard at Columbia City, carving little pieces
                        of marble for individual use, but when the yards of some huge stone
                        corporation came into view, filled with spur tracks and flat cars,
                        transpierced by docks from the river and traversed overhead by immense
                        trundling cranes of wood and steel, it lost all significance in her little
                        world.</p>
                    <p>It was so with the vast railroad yards, with the crowded array of vessels she
                        saw at the river, and the huge factories over the way, lining the
                        water&apos;s edge. Through the open windows she could see the figures of
                        men and women in working aprons, moving busily about. The great streets were
                        wall-lined mysteries to her; the vast offices, strange mazes which concerned
                        far-off individuals of importance. She could only think of people connected
                        with them as counting money, dressing magnificently, and riding in
                        carriages. What they dealt in, how they laboured, to what end it all came,
                        she had only the vaguest conception. It was all wonderful, all vast, all far
                        removed, and she sank in spirit inwardly and fluttered feebly at the heart
                        as she thought of entering any one of these mighty concerns and asking for
                        something to dosomething that she could doanything.</p>

                    <p>Once across the river and into the wholesale district, she glanced about her
                        for some likely door at which to apply. As she contemplated the wide windows
                        and imposing signs, she became conscious of being gazed upon and understood
                        for what she wasa wage-seeker. She had never done this thing before, and
                        lacked courage. To avoid a certain indefinable shame she felt at being
                        caught spying about for a position, she quickened her steps and assumed an
                        air of indifference supposedly common to one upon an errand. In this way she
                        passed many manufacturing and wholesale houses without once glancing in. At
                        last, after several blocks of walking, she felt that this would not do, and
                        began to look about again, though without relaxing her pace. A little way on
                        she saw a great door which, for some reason, attracted her attention. It was
                        ornamented by a small brass sign, and seemed to be the entrance to a vast
                        hive of six or seven floors. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; she thought,
                        &quot;they may want some one,&quot; and crossed over to enter. When
                        she came within a score of feet of the desired goal, she saw through the
                        window a young man in a grey checked suet. That he had anything to do with
                        the concern, she could not tell, but because he happened to be looking in
                        her direction her weakening heart misgave her and she hurried by, too
                        overcome with shame to enter. Over the way stood a great six-story
                        structure, labelled Storm and King, which <pb id="VAA2423-026" n="20"/> she
                        viewed with rising hope. It was a wholesale dry goods concern and employed
                        women. She could see them moving about now and then upon the upper floors.
                        This place she decided to enter, no matter what. She crossed over and walked
                        directly toward the entrance. As she did so, two men came out and paused in
                        the door. A telegraph messenger in blue dashed past her and up the few steps
                        that led to the entrance and disappeared. Several pedestrians out of the
                        hurrying throng which filled the sidewalks passed about her as she paused,
                        hesitating. She looked helplessly around, and then, seeing herself observed,
                        retreated. It was too difficult a task. She could not go past them.</p>
                    <p>So severe a defeat told sadly upon her nerves. Her feet carried her
                        mechanically forward, every foot of her progress being a satisfactory
                        portion of a flight which she gladly made. Block after block passed by. Upon
                        streetlamps at the various corners she read names such as Madison, Monroe,
                        La Salle, Clark, Dearborn, State, and still she went, her feet beginning to
                        tire upon the broad stone flagging. She was pleased in part that the streets
                        were bright and clean. The morning sun, shining down with steadily
                        increasing warmth, made the shady side of the streets pleasantly cool. She
                        looked at the blue sky overhead with more realisation of its charm than had
                        ever come to her before.</p>
                    <p>Her cowardice began to trouble her in a way. She turned back, resolving to
                        hunt up Storm and King and enter. On the way she encountered a great
                        wholesale shoe company, through the broad plate windows of which she saw an
                        enclosed executive department, hidden by frosted glass. Without this
                        enclosure, but just within the street entrance, sat a grey-haired gentleman
                        at a small table, with a large open ledger before him. She walked by this
                        institution several times hesitating, but, finding <pb id="VAA2423-027"
                            n="21"/> herself unobserved, faltered past the screen door and stood
                        humbly waiting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, young lady,&quot; observed the old gentleman, looking at
                        her somewhat kindly, &quot;what is it you wish?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am, that is, do youI mean, do you need any help?&quot; she
                        stammered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not just at present,&quot; he answered smiling. &quot;Not
                        just at present. Come in some time next week. Occasionally we need some
                        one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She received the answer in silence and backed awkwardly out. The pleasant
                        nature of her reception rather astonished her. She had expected that it
                        would be more difficult, that something cold and harsh would be saidshe knew
                        not what. That she had not been put to shame and made to feel her
                        unfortunate position, seemed remarkable.</p>
                    <p>Somewhat encouraged, she ventured into another large structure. It was a
                        clothing company, and more people were in evidencewell-dressed men of forty
                        and more, surrounded by brass railings.</p>
                    <p>An office boy approached her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who is it you wish to see?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to see the manager,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>He ran away and spoke to one of a group of three men who were conferring
                        together. One of these came towards her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well?&quot; he said coldly. The greeting drove all courage from
                        her at once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you need any help?&quot; she stammered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No&quot; he replied abruptly, and turned upon his heel.</p>
                    <p>She went foolishly out, the office boy deferentially swinging the door for
                        her, and gladly sank into the obscuring crowd. It was a severe setback to
                        her recently pleased mental state.</p>
                    <p>Now she walked quite aimlessly for a time, turning here <pb id="VAA2423-028"
                            n="22"/> and there, seeing one great company after another, but finding
                        no courage to prosecute her single inquiry. High noon came, and with it
                        hunger. She hunted out an unassuming restaurant and entered, but was
                        disturbed to find that the prices were exorbitant for the size of her purse.
                        A bowl of soup was all that she could afford, and, with this quickly eaten,
                        she went out again. It restored her strength somewhat and made her
                        moderately bold to pursue the search.</p>
                    <p>In walking a few blocks to few upon some probable place, she again
                        encountered the firm of Storm and King, and this time managed to get in.
                        Some gentlemen were conferring close at hand, but took no notice of her. She
                        was left standing, gazing nervously upon the floor. When the limit of her
                        distress had been nearly reached, she was beckoned to by a man at one of the
                        many desks within the near-by railing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who is it you wish to see?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, any one, if you please,&quot; she answered.&quot;I am
                        looking for something to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you want to see Mr. McManus,&quot; he returned.
                        &quot;Sit down,&quot; and he pointed to a chair against the
                        neighbouring wall. He went on leisurely writing, until after a time a short,
                        stout gentleman came in from the street.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. McManus,&quot;called the man at the desk, &quot;this
                        young woman wants to see you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The short gentleman turned about towards Carrie, and she arose and carne
                        forward.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What can I do for you, miss?&quot; he inquired, surveying her
                        curiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to know if I can get a position,&quot; she inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;As what?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not as anything in particular,&quot; she faltered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you ever had any experience in the wholesale dry goods
                        business?&quot; he questioned.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-029" n="23"/>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you a stenographer or typewriter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we haven&apos;t anything here,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;We employ only experienced help.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She began to step backward toward the door, when something about her
                        plaintive face attracted him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you ever worked at anything before?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, now, it&apos;s hardly possible that you would get
                        anything to do in a wholesale house of this kind. Have you tried the
                        department stores?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She acknowledged that she had not.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, if I were you,&quot; he said, looking at her rather
                        genially, &quot;I would try the department stores. They often need young
                        women as clerks.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, her whole nature relieved by this
                        spark of friendly interest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, as she moved toward the door, &quot;you
                        try the department stores,&quot; and off he went.</p>
                    <p>At that time the department store was in its earliest form of successful
                        operation, and there were not many. The first three in the United States,
                        established about 1884, were in Chicago. Carrie was familiar with the names
                        of several through the advertisements in the &quot;Daily News,&quot;
                        and now proceeded to seek them. The words of Mr. McManus had somehow managed
                        to restore her courage, which had fallen low, and she dared to hope that
                        this new line would offer her something. Some time she spent in wandering up
                        and down, thinking to encounter the buildings by chance, so readily is the
                        mind, bent upon prosecuting a hard but needful errand, eased by that
                        self-deception which the semblance of search, without the reality, gives. At
                        last she inquired of a police <pb id="VAA2423-030" n="24"/> officer, and was
                        directed to proceed &quot;two blocks up,&quot; where she would find
                        &quot;The Fair.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The nature of these vast retail combinations, should they ever permanently
                        disappear, will form an interesting chapter in the commercial history of our
                        nation. Such a flowering out of a modest trade principle the world had never
                        witnessed up to that time. They were along the line of the most effective
                        retail organisation, with hundreds of stores cordinated into one and laid
                        out upon the most imposing and economic basis. They were handsome, bustling,
                        successful affairs, with a host of clerks and a swarm of patrons. Carrie
                        passed along the busy aisles, much affected by the remarkable displays of
                        trinkets, dress goods, stationery, and jewelry. Each separate counter was a
                        show place of dazzling interest and attraction. She could not help feeling
                        the claim of each trinket and valuable upon her personally, and yet she did
                        not stop. There was nothing there which she could not have usednothing which
                        she did not long to own. The dainty slippers and stockings, the delicately
                        frilled skirts and petticoats, the laces, ribbons, hair-combs, purses, all
                        touched her with individual desire, and she felt keenly the fact that not
                        any of these things were in the range of her purchase. She was a
                        work-seeker, an outcast without employment, one whom the average employee
                        could tell at a glance was poor and in need of a situation.</p>
                    <p>It must not be thought that any one could have mistaken her for a nervous,
                        sensitive, high-strung nature, cast unduly upon a cold, calculating, and
                        unpoetic world. Such certainly she was not. But women are peculiarly
                        sensitive to their adornment.</p>
                    <p>Not only did Carrie feel the drag of desire for all which was new and
                        pleasing in apparel for women, but she noticed too, with a touch at the
                        heart, the fine ladies who elbowed and ignored her, brushing past in utter
                        disregard <pb id="VAA2423-031" n="25"/> of her presence, themselves eagerly
                        enlisted in the materials which the store contained. Carrie was not familiar
                        with the appearance of her more fortunate sisters of the city. Neither had
                        she before known the nature and appearance of the shop girls with whom she
                        now compared poorly. They were pretty in the main, some even handsome, with
                        an air of independence and indifference which added, in the case of the more
                        favoured, a certain piquancy. Their clothes were neat, in many instances
                        fine, and wherever she encountered the eye of one it was only to recognise
                        in it a keen analysis of her own position her individual shortcomings of
                        dress and that shadow of <hi rend="i">manner</hi> which she thought must
                        hang about her and make clear to all who and what she was. A flame of envy
                        lighted in her heart. She realised in a dim way how much the city
                        heldwealth, fashion, easeevery adornment for women, and she longed for dress
                        and beauty with a whole heart.</p>
                    <p>On the second floor were the managerial offices, to which, after some
                        inquiry, she was now directed. There she found other girls ahead of her,
                        applicants like herself, but with more of that self-satisfied and
                        independent air which experience of the city lends; girls who scrutinised
                        her in a painful manner. After a wait of perhaps three-quarters of an hour,
                        she was called in turn.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now,&quot; said a sharp, quick-mannered Jew, who was sitting at
                        a roll-top desk near the window, &quot;have you ever worked in any other
                        store?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you haven&apos;t,&quot; he said, eyeing her keenly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we prefer young women just now with some experience. I guess
                        we can&apos;t use you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie stood waiting a moment, hardly certain whether the interview had
                        terminated.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-032" n="26"/>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t wait!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Remember we
                        are very busy here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie began to move quickly to the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold on,&quot; he said, calling her back. &quot;Give me
                        your name and address. We want girls occasionally.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When she had gotten safely into the street, she could scarcely restrain the
                        tears. It was not so much the particular rebuff which she had just
                        experienced, but the whole abashing trend of the day. She was tired and
                        nervous. She abandoned the thought of appealing to the other department
                        stores and now wandered on, felling a certain safety and relief in mingling
                        with the crowd.</p>
                    <p>In her indifferent wandering she turned into Jackson Street, not far from the
                        river, and was keeping her way along the south side of that imposing
                        thoroughfare, when a piece of wrapping paper, written on with marking ink
                        and tacked up on the door, attracted her attention. It read, &quot;Girls
                        wanted---wrappers &amp; stitchers.&quot; She hesitated a moment,
                        then entered.</p>
                    <p>The firm of Speigelheim &amp; Co., makers of boys&apos; caps,
                        occupied one floor of the building, fifty feet in width and some eighty feet
                        in depth. It was a place rather dingily lighted, the darkest portions having
                        incandescent lights, filled with machines and work benches. At the latter
                        laboured quite a company of girls and some men. The former were
                        drabby-looking creatures, stained in face with oil and dust, clad in thin,
                        shapeless, cotton dresses and shod with more or less worn shoes. Many of
                        them had their sleeves rolled up, revealing bare arms, and in some cases,
                        owing to the heat, their dresses were open at the neck. They were a fair
                        type of nearly the lowest order of shop-girlscareless, slouchy, and more or
                        less pale from confinement. They were not timid, however; were rich in
                        curiosity, and strong in daring and slang.</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked about her, very much disturbed and quite <pb id="VAA2423-033"
                            n="27"/> sure that she did not want to work here. Aside from making her
                        uncomfortable by sidelong glances, no one paid her the least attention. She
                        waited until the whole department was aware of her presence. Then some word
                        was sent around, and a foreman, in an apron and shirt sleeves, the latter
                        rolled up to his shoulders, approached.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you want to see me? &quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you need any help? &quot; said Carrie, already learning
                        directness of address.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you know how to stitch caps? &quot; he returned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you ever had any experience at this kind of work?&quot; he
                        inquired.</p>
                    <p>She answered that she had not.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the foreman, scratching his ear meditatively,
                        &quot;we do need a stitcher. We like experienced help, though.
                        We&apos;ve hardly got time to break people in.&quot; He paused and
                        looked away out of the window. &quot;We might, though, put you at
                        finishing,&quot; he concluded reflectively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much do you pay a week? &quot; ventured Carrie, emboldened
                        by a certain softness in the man&apos;s manner and his simplicity of
                        address.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Three and a half,&quot; he answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she was about to exclaim, but checked herself and
                        allowed her thoughts to die without expression.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;re not exactly in need of anybody,&quot; he went on
                        vaguely, looking her over as one would a package. &quot;You can come on
                        Monday morning, though,&quot; he added, &quot;and I&apos;ll put
                        you to work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Carrie weakly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you come, bring an apron,&quot; he added.</p>
                    <p>He walked away and left her standing by the elevator, never so much as
                        inquring her name.</p>
                    <p>While the appearance of the shop and the announcement of the price paid per
                        week operated very much as a <pb id="VAA2423-034" n="28"/> blow to
                        Carrie&apos;s fancy, the fact that work of any kind was offered after so
                        rude a round of experience was gratifying. She could not begin to believe
                        that she would take the place, modest as her aspirations were. She had been
                        used to better than that. Her mere experience and the free out-of-door life
                        of the country caused her nature to revolt at such confinement. Dirt had
                        never been her share. Her sister&apos;s flat was clean. This place was
                        grimy and low, the girls were careless and hardened. They must be bad-minded
                        and hearted, she imagined. Still, a place had been offered her. Surely
                        Chicago was not so bad if she could find one place in one day. She might
                        find another and better later.</p>
                    <p>Her subsequent experience were not of a reassuring nature, however. From all
                        the more pleasing or imposing places she was turned away abruptly with the
                        most chilling formality. In others where she applied only the experienced
                        were required. She met with painful rebuffs, the most trying of which had
                        been in a manufacturing cloak house, where she had gone to the fourth floor
                        to inquire.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no,&quot; said the foreman, a rough, heavily built
                        individual, who looked after a miserably lighted workshop, &quot;we
                        don&apos;t want any one. Don&apos;t come here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>with the wane of the afternoon went her hopes, her courage, and her strength.
                        She had been astonishingly persistent. So earnest an effort was well
                        deserving of a better reward. On every hand, to her fatigued senses, the
                        stolid in its indifference. It seemed as if it was all closed to her, that
                        the struggle was too fierce for her to hope to do anything at all. Men and
                        women hurried by in long, shifting lines. She felt the flow of the tide of
                        effort and interestfelt her own helplessness without quite realising the
                        wisp on the tide that she was. She cast about vainly <pb id="VAA2423-035"
                            n="29"/> for some possible place to apply, but found no door which she
                        had the courage to enter. It would be the same thing all over. The old
                        humiliation of her plea, rewarded by curt denial. Sick at heart and in body,
                        she turned to the west, the direction of Minnie&apos;s flat, which she
                        had now fixed in mind, and began that wearisome, baffled retreat which the
                        seeker for employment at nightfall too often makes. In passing through Fifth
                        Avenue, south towards Van Buren Street, where she intended to take a car,
                        she passed the door of a large wholesale shoe house, through the plate-glass
                        window of which she could see a middle-aged gentleman sitting at a small
                        desk. One of those forlorn impulses which often grow out of a fixed sense of
                        defeat, the last sprouting of a baffled and uprooted growth of ideas, seized
                        upon her. She walked deliberately through the door and up to the gentleman,
                        who looked at her weary face with partially awakened interest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can you give me something to do?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, I really don&apos;t know,&quot; he said kindly.
                        &quot;What kind of work is it you wantyou&apos;re not a typewriter,
                        are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; answered Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we only employ book-keepers and typewriters here. You might
                        go around to the side and inquire upstairs. They did want some help upstairs
                        a few days ago. Ask for Mr. Brown.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She hastened around to the side entrance and was taken up by the elevator to
                        the fourth floor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Call Mr Brown Willie&quot; said the elevator man to a boy near
                        by.</p>
                    <p>Wille went off and presently returned with the information that Mr. Brown
                        said she should sit down and that he would be around in a little while.</p>
                    <p>It was a portion of the stock room which gave no idea <pb id="VAA2423-036"
                            n="30"/> of the general character of the place, and Carrie could form no
                        opinion of the nature of the work.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you want something to do,&quot; said Mr. Brown, after he
                        inquired concerning the nature of her errand. &quot;Have you ever been
                        employed in a shoe factory before?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is your name?&quot; he inquired, and being informed,
                        &quot;Well, I don&apos;t know as I have anything for you. Would you
                        work for four and a half a week?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie was too worn by defeat not to feel that it was considerable. She had
                        not expected that he would offer her less than six. She acquiesced, however,
                        and he took her name and address.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, finally, &quot;you report here at
                        eight o&apos;clock Monday morning. I think I can find something for you
                        to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He left her revived by the possibilities, sure that she had found something
                        at last. Instantly the blood crept warmly over her body. Her nervous tension
                        relaxed. She walked out into the busy street and discovered a new
                        atmosphere. Behold, the throng was moving with a lightsome step. She noticed
                        that men and women were smiling. Scraps of conversation and notes of
                        laughter floated to her. The air was light. People were already pouring out
                        of the buildings, their labour ended for the day. She noticed that they were
                        pleased, and thoughts of her sister&apos;s home and the meal that would
                        be awaiting her quickened her steps. She hurried on, tired perhaps, but no
                        longer weary of foot. What would not Minnie say! Ah, the long winter in
                        Chicagothe lights, the crowd, the amusement! This was a great, pleasing
                        metropolis after all. Her new firm was a goodly institution. Its windows
                        were of huge plate glass. She could probably do well there. Thoughts of
                        Drouet returnedof the things he had told her. She now felt that life was
                        better, <pb id="VAA2423-037" n="31"/> that it was livelier, sprightlier. She
                        boarded a car in the best of spirits, feeling her blood still flowing
                        pleasantly. She would live in Chicago, her mind kept saying to itself. She
                        would have a better time than she had ever had before she would be
                        happy.</p>

                    <p>For the next two days Carrie indulged in the most high-flown
                        speculations.</p>
                    <p>Her fancy plunged recklessly into privileges and amusement which would have
                        been much more becoming had she been cradled a child of fortune. With ready
                        will and quick mental selection she scattered her meagre four-fifty per week
                        with a swift and graceful hand. Indeed, as she sat in her rocking-chair
                        these several evenings before going to bed and looked out upon the
                        pleasantly lighted street, this money cleared for its prospective possessor
                        the way to every joy and every bauble which the heart of woman may desire.
                        &quot;I will have a fine time,&quot; she thought.</p>
                    <p>Her sister Minnie knew nothing of these rather wild cerebrations, though they
                        exhausted the markets of delight. She was too busy scrubbing the kitchen
                        wood-work and calculating the purchasing power of eighty cents for
                        Sunday&apos;s dinner. When Carrie had returned home, flushed with her
                        first success and ready, for all her weariness, to discuss the now
                        interesting events which led up to her achievement, the former had merely
                        smiled approvingly and inquired whether she would have to spend any of it
                        for car fare. This consideration had not entered in before, and it did not
                        now for long affect the glow of Carrie&apos;s enthusiasm. Disposed as
                        she then was to calculate upon that vague basis which allows the subtraction
                            <pb id="VAA2423-039" n="33"/> of one sum from another without any
                        perceptible diminution, she was happy.</p>
                    <p>When Hanson came home at seven o&apos;clock, he was inclined to be a
                        little crustymdash;his usual demeanour before supper. This never showed so
                        much in anything he said as in a certain solemnity of countenance and the
                        silent manner in which he slopped about. He had a pair of yellow carpet
                        slippers which he enjoyed wearing, and these he would immediately substitute
                        for his solid pair of shoes. This, and washing his face with the aid of
                        common washing soap until it glowed a shiny red, constituted his only
                        preparation for his evening meal. He would then get his evening paper and
                        read in silence.</p>
                    <p>For a young man, this was rather a morbid turn of character, and so affected
                        Carrie. Indeed, it affected the entire atmosphere of the flat, as such
                        things are inclined to do, and gave to his wife&apos;s mind its subdued
                        and tactful turn, anxious to avoid taciturn replies. Under the influence of
                        Carrie&apos;s announcement he brightened up some-what.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You didn&apos;t lose any time, did you?&quot; he remarked,
                        smiling a little.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; returned Carrie with a touch of pride.</p>
                    <p>He asked her one or two more questions and then turned to play with the baby,
                        leaving the subject until it was brought up again by Minnie at the
                        table.</p>
                    <p>Carrie, however, was not to he reduced to the common level of observation
                        which prevailed in the flat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It seems to be such a large company.&quot; she said, at one
                        place. &quot;Great big plate-glass windows and lots of clerks. The man I
                        saw said they hired ever no many people.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s not very hard to get work now,&quot; put in
                        Hanson, &quot;if you look right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Minnie, under the warming influence of Carrie&apos;s good spirits and her
                        husband&apos;s somewhat conversational mood, <pb id="VAA2423-040" n="34"
                        /> began to tell Carrie of some of the well-known things to seemdash;things
                        the enjoyment of which cost nothing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d like to see Michigan Avenue. There are such fine
                        houses. It is such a fine street.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is &apos;H. R. Jacob&apos;s&apos;?&quot;
                        interrupted Carrie, mentioning one of the theatres devoted to melodrama
                        which went by that name at the time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, its not very far from here,&quot; answered Minnie.
                        &quot;It&apos;s in Halstead Street, right up here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How I&apos;d like to go there. I crossed Halstead Street
                        to-day, didn&apos;t I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this there was a slight halt in the natural reply. Thoughts are a
                        strangely permeating factor. At her suggestion of going to the theatre, the
                        unspoken shade of disapproval to the doing of those things which involved
                        the expenditure of moneymdash;shades of feeling which arose in the mind of
                        Hanson and then in Minniemdash;slightly affected the atmosphere of the
                        table. Minnie answered &quot;yes,&quot; but Carrie could feel that
                        going to the theatre was poorly advocated here. The subject was put off for
                        a little while until Hanson, through with his meal, took his paper and went
                        into the front room.</p>
                    <p>When they were alone, the two sisters began a somewhat freer conversation,
                        Carrie interrupting it to hum a little, as they worked at the dishes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should like to walk up and see Halstead Street, if it
                        isn&apos;t too far,&quot; said Carrie, after a time. &quot;Why
                        don&apos;t we go to the theatre to-night?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t think Sven would want to go
                        to-night,&quot; returned Minnie. &quot; He has to get up so
                        early.&quot; &quot;He wouldn&apos;t mindhe&apos;d enjoy
                        it,&quot; said Carrie. &quot; No, he doesn&apos;t go very
                        often,&quot; returned Minnie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;d like to go,&quot; rejoined Carrie.
                        &quot;Let&apos;s you and me go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Minnie pondered a while, not upon whether she Could <pb id="VAA2423-041"
                            n="35"/> or would gofor that point was already negatively settled with
                        herbut upon some means of diverting the thoughts of her sister to some other
                        topic.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll go some other time,&quot; she said at last,
                        finding no ready means of escape.</p>
                    <p>Carrie sensed the root of the opposition at once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have some money,&quot; she said. &quot;You go with
                        me.&quot; Minnie shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He could go along,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; returned Minnie softly, and rattling the dishes to
                        drown the conversation. &quot;He wouldn&apos;t,&quot;</p>
                    <p>It had been several years since Minnie had seen Carrie, and in that time the
                        latter&apos;s character had developed a few shades. Naturally timid in
                        all things that related to her own advancement, and especially so when
                        without power or resource, her craving for pleasure was so strong that it
                        was the one stay of her nature. She would speak for that when silent on all
                        else.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ask him,&quot; she pleaded softly.</p>
                    <p>Minnie was thinking of the resource which Carrie&apos;s board would add.
                        It would pay the rent and would make the subject of expenditure a little
                        less difficult to talk about with her husband. But if Carrie was going to
                        think of running around in the beginning there would be a hitch somewhere.
                        Unless Carrie submitted to a solemn round of industry and saw the need of
                        hard work without longing for play, how was her coming to the city to profit
                        them? These thoughts were not those of a cold, hard nature at all. They were
                        the serious reflections of a mind which invariably adjusted itself, without
                        much complaining, to such surroundings as its industry could make for
                        it.</p>
                    <p>At last she yielded enough to ask Hanson. It was a half-hearted procedure
                        without a shade of desire on her part.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-042" n="36"/>
                    <p>&quot;Carrie wants us to go to the theatre,&quot; she said, looking
                        in upon her husband. Hanson looked up from his paper, and they exchanged a
                        mild look, which said as plainly as anything: &quot;This isn&apos;t
                        what we expected.&quot; </p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care to go,&quot; he returned. &quot;What
                        does she want to see?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;H.R. Jacob&apos;s,&quot; said Minnie. He looked down at his
                        paper and shook his head negatively.</p>
                    <p> When Carrie saw how they looked upon her proposition, she gained a still
                        clearer feeling of their way of life. It weighed on her, but took no
                        definite form of opposition.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I&apos;&apos;ll go down and stand at the foot of
                        the stairs,&quot; she said, after a time.</p>
                    <p>Minnie made no objection to this, and Carrie put on her hat and went
                        below.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where has Carrie gone?&quot; asked Hanson, coming back into the
                        dining-room when he heard the door close.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She said she was going down to the foot of the stairs,&quot;
                        answered Minnie. &quot;I guess she just wants to look out a
                        while.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She oughtn&apos;t to be thinking about spending her money on
                        theatres already, do you think?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She just feels a little curious, I guess,&quot; ventured
                        Minnied. &quot;Everything is so new.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Hanson, and went over to the
                        baby, his forehead slightly wrinkled.</p>
                    <p>He was thinking of a full career of vanity and wastefulness which a young
                        girl might indulge in, and wondering how Carrie could contemplate such a
                        course when she had so little, as yet, with which to do.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday Carrie went out by herself-first toward the river, which
                        interested her, and then back along Jackson Street, which was then lined by
                        the pretty houses and find lawns which subsequently caused it to be made
                        into</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-043" n="37"/>
                    <p>a boulevard. She was struck with the evidences of wealth, although there was,
                        perhaps, not a person on the street worth more than a hundred thousand
                        dollars. She was glad to be out of the flat, because already she felt that
                        it was a narrow, humdrum place, and that interest and joy lay elsewhere. Her
                        thoughts now were of a more liberal character, and she punctuated them with
                        speculations as to the whereabouts of Drouet. She was not sure but that he
                        might call anyhow Monday night, and, while she felt a little disturbed at
                        the possibility, there was, nevertheless, just the shade of a wish that he
                        would.</p>
                    <p>On Monday she arose early and prepared to go to work. She dressed herself in
                        a worn shirt-waist of dotted blue percale, a skirt of light-brown serge
                        rather faded, and a small straw hat which she had worn all summer at
                        Columbia City. Her shoes were old, and her necktie was in that crumpled,
                        flattened state which time and much wearing impart. She made a very average
                        looking shop-girl with the exception of her features. These were slightly
                        more even than common, and gave her a sweet, reserved, and pleasing
                        appearance.</p>
                    <p>It is no easy thing to get up early in the morning when one is used to
                        sleeping until seven and eight, as Carrie had been at home. She gained some
                        inkling of the character of Hanson&apos;s life when, half asleep, she
                        looked out into the dining-room at six o&apos;clock and saw him silently
                        finishing his breakfast. By the time she was dressed he was gone, and she,
                        Minnie, and the baby ate together, the latter being just old enough to sit
                        in a high chair and disturb the dishes with a spoon. Her spirits were
                        greatly subdued now when the fact of entering upon strange and untried
                        duties confronted her. Only the ashes of all her fine fancies were
                        remainingashes still concealing, nevertheless, a few red embers of hope. So
                        subdued was she by her weakening nerves, that she ate quite in silence, <pb
                            id="VAA2423-044" n="38"/> going over imaginary conceptions of the
                        character of the shoe company, the nature of the work, her
                        employer&apos;s attitude. She was vaguely feeling that she would come in
                        contact with the great owners, that her work would be where grave, stylishly
                        dressed men occasionally look on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, good luck,&quot; said Minnie, when she was ready to go.
                        They had agreed it was best to walk, that morning at least, to see if she
                        could do it every daysixty cents a week for car fare being quite an item
                        under the circumstances</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll tell you how it goes to-night,&quot; said
                        Carrie.</p>
                    <p>Once in the sunlit street, with labourers tramping by in either direction,
                        the horse-cars passing crowded to the rails with the small clerks and floor
                        help in the great wholesale houses, and men and women generally coming out
                        of doors and passing about the neighbourhood, Carrie felt slightly
                        reassured. In the sunshine of the morning, beneath the wide, blue heavens,
                        with a fresh wind astir, what fears, except the most desperate, can find a
                        harbourage? In the night, or the gloomy chambers of the day, fears and
                        misgivings wax strong, but out in the sunlight there is, for a time,
                        cessation even of the terror of death.</p>
                    <p>Carrie went straight forward until she crossed the river, and then tuned into
                        Fifth Avenue. The thoroughfare, in this part, was like a walled caon of
                        brown stone and dark red brick. The Big windows looked shiny and clean.
                        Trucks were rumbling in increasing numbers; men and women, girls and boys
                        were moving onward in all directions. She met girls of her own age, who
                        looked at her as if with contempt for her diffidence. She wondered at the
                        magnitude of this life and at the importance of knowing much in order to do
                        anything in it at all. Dread at her own inefficiency crept upon her. She
                        would not know how, she would not be quick enough. Had not all the other
                        places refused her because she did not know <pb id="VAA2423-045" n="39"/>
                        something or other? She would be scolded, abused, ignominiously
                        discharged.</p>
                    <p>It was with weak knees and a slight catch in her breathing that she came up
                        to the great shoe company at Adams and Fifth Avenue and entered the
                        elevator. When she stepped out on the fourth floor there was no one at hand,
                        only great aisles of boxes piled to the ceiling. She stood, very much
                        frightened, awaiting some one.</p>
                    <p>Presently Mr. Brown came up. He did not seem to recognise her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it you want?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <p>Carrie&apos;s heart sank.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You said I should come this morning to see about work&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he interrupted. &quot;Umyes. What is your
                        name?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Carrie Meeber.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said he. &quot;You come with me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He led the way through dark, box-lined aisles which had the smell of new
                        shoes, until they came to an iron door which opened into the factory proper.
                        There was a large, low-ceiled room, with clacking, rattling machines at
                        which men in white shirt sleeves and blue gingham aprons were working. She
                        followed him diffidently through the clattering automatons, keeping her eyes
                        straight before her, and flushing slightly. They crossed to a far corner and
                        took an elevator to the sixth floor. Out of the array of machines and
                        benches, Mr. Brown signalled a foreman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is the girl,&quot; he said, and turning to Carrie,
                        &quot;You go with him.&quot; He then returned, and Carrie followed
                        her new superior to a little desk in a corner, which he used as a kind of
                        official centre.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve never worked at anything like this before, have
                        you?&quot; he questioned, rather sternly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-046" n="40"/>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>He seemed rather annoyed at having to bother with such help, but put down her
                        name and then led her across to where a line of girls occupied stools in
                        front of clacking machines. On the shoulder of one of the girls who was
                        punching eye-holes in one piece of the upper, by the aid of the machine, he
                        put his hand</p>
                    <p>&quot;You,&quot; he said, &quot;show this girl how to do what
                        you&apos;re doing. When you get through, come to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The girl so addressed rose promptly and gave Carrie her place.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t hard to do,&quot; she said, bending over.
                        &quot;You just take this so, fasten it with this clamp, and start the
                        machine&quot;</p>
                    <p>She suited action to word, fastened the piece of leather, which was
                        eventually to form the right half of the upper of a man&apos;s shoe, by
                        little adjustable clamps, and pushed a small steel rod at the side of the
                        machine. The latter jumped to the task of punching, with sharp, snapping
                        clicks, cutting circular bits of leather out of the side of the upper,
                        leaving the holes which were to hold the laces. After observing a few times,
                        the girl let her work at it alone. Seeing that it was fairly well done, she
                        went away.</p>
                    <p>The pieces of leather came from the girl at the machine to her right, and
                        were passed on to the girl at her left. Carrie saw at once that an average
                        speed was necessary or the work would pile up on her and all those below
                        would be delayed. She had no time to look about, and bent anxiously to her
                        task. The girls at her left and right realised her predicament and feelings,
                        and, in a way, tried to aid her, as much as they dared, by working
                        slower.</p>
                    <p>At this task she laboured incessantly for some time, finding relief from her
                        own nervous fears and imaginings in the humdrum, mechanical movement of the
                        machine She felt, as the minutes passed, that the room was not very <pb
                            id="VAA2423-047" n="41"/> light. It had a thick odour of fresh leather,
                        but that did not worry her. She felt the eyes of the other help upon her,
                        and troubled lest she was not working fast enough.</p>
                    <p>Once, when she was fumbling at the little clamp, having made a slight error
                        in setting in the leather, a great hand appeared before her eyes and
                        fastened the clamp for her. It was the foreman. Her heart thumped so that
                        she could scarcely see to go on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Start your machine,&quot; he said, &quot;start your
                        machine. Don&apos;t keep the line waiting.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This recovered her sufficiently and she went excitedly on, hardly breathing
                        until the shadow moved away from behind her. Then she heaved a great
                        breath.</p>
                    <p>As the morning wore on the room became hotter. she felt the need of a breath
                        of fresh air and a drink of water, but did not venture to stir. The stool
                        she sat on was without a back or foot-rest, and she began to feel
                        uncomfortable. She found, after a time, that her back was beginning to ache.
                        She twisted and turned from one position to another slightly different, but
                        it did not ease her for long. She was beginning to weary.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stand up, why don&apos;t you?&quot; said the girl at her
                        right, without any form of introduction. &quot;They won&apos;t
                        care.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at her gratefully. &quot;I guess I will,&quot; she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>She stood up from her stool and worked that way for a while, but it was a
                        more difficult position. Her neck and shoulders ached in bending over.</p>
                    <p>The spirit of the place impressed itself on her in a rough way. She did not
                        venture to look around, but above the clack of the machine she could hear an
                        occasional remark. She could also note a thing or two out of the side of her
                        eye.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you see Harry last night? &quot;said the girl at her left,
                        addressing her neighbour.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-048" n="42"/>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot; You ought to have seen the tie he had on. Gee, but he was a
                        mark.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;S-s-t,&quot; said the other girl, bending over her work. The
                        first, silenced, instantly assumed a solemn face. The foreman passed slowed
                        along, eyeing each worker distinctly The moment he was gone, the
                        conversation was resumed again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say,&quot; began the girl at her left, &quot; what jeh
                        think he said?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot; He said he saw us with Eddie Harris at Martin&apos;s last
                        night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No I&quot; They both giggled.</p>
                    <p>A youth with tan-coloured hair, that needed clipping very badly, came
                        shuffling along between the machines, bearing a basket of leather findings
                        under his left arm, and pressed against his stomach. When near Carrie, he
                        stretched out his right hand and gripped one girl under the arm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw, let me go,&quot; she exclaimed angrily.
                        &quot;Duffer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He only grinned broadly in return.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rubber!&quot; he called back as she looked after him. There was
                        nothing of the gallant in him.</p>
                    <p>Carrie at last could scarcely sit still. Her legs began to tire and she
                        wanted to get up and stretch. Would noon never come? It seemed as if she had
                        worked an entire day. She was not hungry at all, but weak, and her eyes were
                        tired, straining at the one point where the eye-punch came down. The girl at
                        the right noticed her squirmings and felt sorry for her. She was
                        concentrating herself too thoroughly---what she did really required less
                        mental and physical strain. There was nothing to be done, however. The
                        halves of the uppers came piling steadily down. Her hands began to ache at
                        the wrists and then in the fingers, <pb id="VAA2423-049" n="43"/> and
                        towards the last she seemed one mass of dull, complaining muscles, fixed in
                        an eternal position and performing a single mechanical movement which became
                        more and more distasteful, until at last it was absolutely nauseating. When
                        she was wondering whether the strain would ever cease, a dull-sounding bell
                        clanged somewhere down an elevator shaft, and the end came. In an instant
                        there was a buzz of action and conversation. All the girls instantly left
                        their stools and hurried away in an adjoining room, men passed through,
                        coming from some department which opened on the right. The whirling wheels
                        began to sing in a steadily modifying key, until at last they died away in a
                        low buzz. There was an audible stillness, in which the common voice sounded
                        strange.</p>
                    <p>Carrie got up and sought her lunch box. She was stiff, a little dizzy, and
                        very thirsty. On the way to the small space portioned off by wood, where all
                        the wraps and lunches were kept, she encountered the foreman, who stared at
                        her hard.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;did you get along all
                        right?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think so,&quot; she replied, very respectfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Um,&quot; he replied, for want of something better, and walked
                        on.</p>
                    <p>Under better material conditions, this kind of work would not have been so
                        bad, the new socialism which involves pleasant working conditions for
                        employees had not then taken hold upon manufacturing companies.</p>
                    <p>The place smelled of the oil of the machines and the new leather---a
                        combination which, added to the stale odours of the building, was not
                        pleasant even in cold weather. The floor, though regularly swept every
                        evening, presented a littered surface. Not the slightest provision had been
                        made for the comfort of the employees, the idea being that something was
                        gained by giving them as little <pb id="VAA2423-050" n="44"/> and making the
                        work as hard and unremunerative as possible. What we know of foot-rests,
                        swivel-back chairs, dining-rooms for the girls, clean aprons and curling
                        irons supplied free, and a decent cloak room, were unthought of. The
                        washrooms were disagreeable, crude, if not foul places, and the whole
                        atmosphere was sordid.</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked about her, after she had drunk a tinful of water from a bucket
                        in one corner, for a place to sit and eat. The other girls had ranged
                        themselves about the gone out. She saw no place which did not hold a couple
                        or a group of girls, and being too timid to think of intruding herself, she
                        sought out her machine and, seated upon her stool, opened her lunch on her
                        lap. There she sat listening to the chatter and comment about her. It was,
                        for the most part, silly and graced by the current slang. Several of the men
                        in the room exchanged compliments with the girls at long range.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say, Kitty,&quot; called one to a girl who was doing a waltz
                        step in a. few feet of space near one of the windows, &quot; are you
                        going to the ball with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look out, Kitty,&quot; called another,
                        &quot;you&apos;ll jar your back hair.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go on, Rubber,&quot; was her only comment.</p>
                    <p>As Carrie listened to this and much more of similar familiar badinage among
                        the men and girls, she instinctively withdrew into herself. She was not used
                        to this type, and felt that there was something hard and low about it all.
                        She feared that the young boys about would address such remarks to
                        her---boys who, beside Drouet, seemed uncouth and ridiculous. She made the
                        average feminine distinction between clothes, putting worth, goodness, and
                        distinction in a dress suit, and leaving all the unlovely qualities and
                        those beneath notice in overalls and jumper.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-051" n="45"/>
                    <p>She was glad when the short half hour was over and the wheels began to whirr
                        again. Though wearied, she would be inconspicuous. This illusion ended when
                        another young man passed along the aisle and poked her indifferently in the
                        ribs with his thumb. She turned about, indignation leaping to her eyes, but
                        he had gone on and only once turned to grin. She found it difficult to
                        conquer an inclination to crys.</p>
                    <p>The girl next her noticed her state of mind. &quot;Don&apos;t you
                        mind,&quot; she said. &quot;He&apos;s too fresh.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie said nothing, but bent over her work. She felt as though she could
                        hardly endure such a life. Her idea of work had been so entirely different.
                        All during the long afternoon she thought of the city outside and its
                        imposing show, crowds, and fine buildings. Columbia City and the better side
                        of her home life came back. By three o&apos;clock she was sure it must
                        be six, and by four it seemed as if they had forgotten to note the hour and
                        were letting all work overtime. The foreman became a true ogre, prowling
                        constantly about, keeping her tied down to her miserable task. What she
                        heard of the conversation about her only made her feel sure that she did not
                        want to make friends with any of these. When six o&apos;clock came she
                        hurried eagerly away, her arms aching and her limbs stiff from sitting in
                        one position.</p>
                    <p>As she passed out along the hall after getting her hat, a young machine hand,
                        attracted by her looks, made bold to jest with her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say, Maggie,&quot; he called, &quot;if you wait,
                        I&apos;ll walk with you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was thrown so straight in her direction that she knew who was meant, but
                        never turned to look.</p>
                    <p>In the crowded elevator, another dusty, toil-stained youth tried to make an
                        impression on her by leering in her face.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-052" n="46"/>
                    <p>One young man, waiting on the walk outside for the appearance of another,
                        grinned at her as she passed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ain&apos;t going my way, are you?&quot; he called
                        jocosely.</p>
                    <p>Carrie turned her face to the west with a subdued heart. As she turned the
                        corner, she saw through the great shiny window the small desk at which she
                        had applied. There were the crowds, hurrying with the same buzz and
                        energy-yielding enthusiasm. She felt a slight relief, but it was only at her
                        escape. She felt ashamed in the face of better dressed girls who went by.
                        She felt as though she should be better served, and her heart revolted.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">A GLITTERING NIGHT FLOWER: THE USE OF A NAME</head>
                    <p>Drouet did not call that evening. After receiving the letter, he had laid
                        aside all thought of Carrie for the time being and was floating around
                        having what he considered a gay time. On this particular evening he dined at
                        &quot;Rector&apos;s,&quot; a restaurant of some local fame,
                        which occupied a basement at Clark and Monroe Streets. Thereafter he visited
                        the resort of Fitzgerald and Moy&apos;s in Adams Street, opposite the
                        imposing Federal Building. There he leaned over the splendid bar and
                        swallowed a glass of plain whiskey and purchased a couple of cigars, one of
                        which he lighted. This to him represented in part high lifea fair sample of
                        what the whole most be.</p>
                    <p>Drouet was not a drinker in excess. He was not a moneyed man. He only craved
                        the best, as his mind conceived it, and such doings seemed to him a part of
                        the best. Rector&apos;s, with its polished marble walls and floor, its
                        profusion of lights, its show of china and silverware, and, above all, its
                        reputation as a resort for actors and professional men, seemed to him the
                        proper place fora successful man to go. He loved fine clothes, good eating,
                        and particularly the company and acquaintanceship of successful men. When
                        dining, it was a source of keen satisfaction to him to know that Joseph
                        Jefferson was wont to come to this same place, or that Henry E. Dixie, a
                        well-known performer of the day, was then only a few tables off. At
                        Rector&apos;s he could always obtain this satisfaction, <pb
                            id="VAA2423-054" n="48"/> for there one could encounter politicians,
                        brokers, actors, some rich young &quot;rounders&quot; of the town,
                        all eating and drinking amid a buzz of popular commonplace conversation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s So-and-so over there,&quot; was a common remark
                        of these gentlemen among themselves, particularly among those who had not
                        yet reached, but hoped to do so, the dazzling height which money to dine
                        here lavishly represented.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t say so,&quot; would be the reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, yes, didn&apos;t you know that? Why, he&apos;s manages
                        of the Grand Opera House.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When these things would fall upon Drouet&apos;s ears, he would straighten
                        himself a little more stiffly and eat with solid comfort. If he had any
                        vanity, this augmented it, and if he had any ambition, this stirred it. He
                        would be able to flash a roll of greenbacks too some clay. As it was, he
                        could eat where <hi rend="i">they</hi> did.</p>
                    <p>His preference for Fitzgerald and Moy&apos;s Adams Street place was
                        another yard off the same cloth. This was really a gorgeous saloon from a
                        Chicago standpoint. Like Rector&apos;s, it was also ornamented with a
                        blaze of incandescent lights, held in handsome chandeliers. The floors were
                        of brightly coloured tiles, the walls a composition of rich, dark, polished
                        wood, which reflected the light, and coloured stucco-work, which gave the
                        place a very sumptuous appearance. The long bar was a blaze of lights,
                        polished wood-work, coloured and cut glassware, and many fancy bottles. It
                        was a truly swell saloon, with rich screens, fancy wines, and a line of bar
                        goods unsurpassed in the country.</p>
                    <p>At Rector&apos;s, Drouet had met Mr. G. W. Hurstwood, manager of
                        Fitzgerald and Moy&apos;s. He had been pointed out as a very successful
                        and well-known man about town. Hurstwood looked the part, for, besides <pb
                            id="VAA2423-055" n="49"/> being slightly under forty, he had a good,
                        stout constitution, an active manner, and a solid, substantial air, which
                        was composed in part of his fine clothes, his clean linen, his jewels, and,
                        above all, his own sense of his importance. Drouet immediately conceived a
                        notion of him as being some one worth knowing, and was glad not only to meet
                        him, but to visit the Adams Street bar thereafter whenever he wanted a drink
                        or a cigar.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was an interesting character after his kind. He was shrewd and
                        clever in many little things, and capable of creating a good impression. His
                        managerial position was fairly importanta kind of stewardship which was
                        imposing, but lacked financial control. He had risen by perseverance and
                        industry, through long years of service, from the position of barkeeper in a
                        commonplace saloon to his present altitude. He had a little office in the
                        place, set off in polished cherry and grill-work, where he kept, in a
                        roll-top desk, the rather simple accounts of the placesupplies ordered and
                        needed. The chief executive and financial functions devolved upon the
                        ownersMessrs. Fitzgerald and Moyand upon a cashier who looked after the
                        money taken in.</p>
                    <p>For the most part he lounged about, dressed in excellent tailored suits of
                        imported goods, a solitaire ring, a fine blue diamond in his tie, a striking
                        vest of some new pattern, and a watch-chain of solid gold, which held a
                        charm of rich design, and a watch of the latest make and engraving. He knew
                        by name, and could greet personally with a &quot;Well, old
                        fellow,&quot; hundreds of actors, merchants, politicians, and the
                        general run of successful characters about town, and it was part of his
                        success to do so. He had a finely graduated scale of informality and
                        friendship, which improved from the &quot;How do you do?&quot;
                        addressed to the fifteen-dollar-a-week clerks and office attachs, who, by
                        long frequenting of the place, became aware of his position, <pb
                            id="VAA2423-056" n="50"/> to the &quot;Why, old man, how are
                        you?&quot; which he addressed to those noted or rich individuals who
                        knew him and were inclined to be friendly. There was a class, however, too
                        rich, too famous, or too successful, with whom he could not attempt any
                        familiarity of address, and with these he was professionally tactful,
                        assuming a grave and dignified attitude, paying them the deference which
                        would win their good feeling without in the least compromising his own
                        bearing and opinions. There were, in the last place, a few good followers,
                        neither rich nor poor, famous, nor yet remarkably successful, with whom he
                        was friendly on the score of good-fellowship. These were the kind of men
                        with whom he would converse longest and most seriously. He loved to go out
                        and have a good time once in a whileto go to the races, the theatres, the
                        sporting entertainments at some of the clubs. He kept a horse and neat trap,
                        had his wife and two children, who were well established in a neat house on
                        the North Side near Lincoln Park, and was altogether a very acceptable
                        individual of our great American upper classthe first grade below the
                        luxuriously rich.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood liked Drouet. The latter&apos;s genial nature and dressy
                        appearance pleased him. He knew that Drouet was only a travelling
                        salesmanand not one of many years at thatbut the firm of Bartlett, Caryoe
                        &amp; Company was a large and prosperous house, and Drouet stood well.
                        Hurstwood knew Caryoe quite well, having drunk a glass now and then with
                        him, in company with several others, when the conversation was general.
                        Drouet had what was a help in his business, a moderate sense of humour, and
                        could tell a good story when the occasion required. He could talk races with
                        Hurstwood, tell interesting incidents concerning himself and his experiences
                        with women, and report the state of trade in the cities which he visited,
                        and so managed to make himself <pb id="VAA2423-057" n="51"/> almost
                        invariably agreeable. To-night he was particularly so, since his report to
                        the company had been favourably commented upon, his new samples had been
                        satisfactorily selected, and his trip marked out for the next six weeks.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, hello, Charlie, old man,&quot; said Hurstwood, as Drouet
                        came in that evening about eight o&apos;clock. &quot;How goes it?
                        &quot; The room was crowded.</p>
                    <p>Drouet shook hands, beaming good nature, and they strolled towards the
                        bar.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t seen you in six weeks. When did you get
                        in?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Friday,&quot; said Drouet. &quot;Had a fine
                        trip.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Glad of it,&quot; said Hurstwood, his black eyes lit with a
                        warmth which half displaced the cold make-believe that usually dwelt in
                        them. &quot;What are you going to take:?&quot; he added, as the
                        barkeeper, in snowy jacket and tie, leaned toward them from behind the
                        bar.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Old Pepper,&quot; said Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A little of the same for me,&quot; put in Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How long are you in town this time?&quot; inquired
                        Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Only until Wednesday. I&apos;m going up to St. Paul.&quot;
                        &quot;George Evans was in here Saturday and said he saw you in Milwaukee
                        last week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I saw George,&quot; returned Drouet. &quot;Great old
                        boy, isn&apos;t he? We had quite a time there together.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The barkeeper was setting out the glasses and bottle before them, and they
                        now poured out the draught as they talked, Drouet filling his to within a
                        third of full, as was considered proper, and Hurstwood taking the barest
                        suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with seltzer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s become of Caryoe?&quot; remarked Hurstwood.
                        &quot;I haven&apos;t seen him around here in two
                        weeks.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-058" n="52"/>
                    <p>&quot;Laid up, they say,&quot; exclaimed Drouet. &quot;Say,
                        he&apos;s a gouty old boy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Made a lot of money in his time, though, hasn&apos;t
                        he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, wads of it,&quot; returned Drouet &quot;He
                        won&apos;t live much longer. Barely comes down to the office
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just one boy, hasn&apos;t he?&quot; asked Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and a swift-pacer,&quot; laughed Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess he can&apos;t hurt the business very much, though, with
                        the other members all there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, he can&apos;t injure that any, I guess.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was standing, his coat open, his thumbs in his pockets, the light
                        on his jewels and rings relieving them with agreeable distinctness. He was
                        the picture of fastidious comfort.</p>
                    <p>To one not inclined to drink, and gifted with a more serious turn of mind,
                        such a bubbling, chattering, glittering chamber must ever seem an anomaly, a
                        strange commentary on nature and life. Here some the moths, in endless
                        procession, to bask in the light of the flame. Such conversation as one may
                        hear would not warrant a commendation of the scene upon intellectual
                        grounds. It seems plain that schemers would choose more sequestered quarters
                        to arrange their plans, that politicians would not gather sere in company to
                        discuss anything save formalities, where the sharp-eared may hear, and it
                        would scarcely be justified on the score of thirst, for the majority of
                        those who frequent these more gorgeous places have no craving for liquor.
                        Nevertheless, the fact that here men gather, here chatter, here love to pass
                        and rub elbows, must be explained upon some grounds. It must be that a
                        strange bundle of passions and vague desires give rise to such a curious
                        social institution or it would not be.</p>
                    <p>Drouet, for one, was lured as much by his longing for pleasure as by his
                        desire to shine among his betters. The many friends he met here dropped in
                        because they craved, <pb id="VAA2423-059" n="53"/> without, perhaps,
                        consciously analysing it, the company, the glow, the atmosphere which they
                        found. One might take it, after all, as an augur of the better social order,
                        for the things which they satisfied here, though sensory, were not evil. No
                        evil could come out of the contemplation of an expensively decorated
                        chamber. The worst effect of such a thing would be, perhaps, to stir up in
                        the material-minded an ambition to arrange their lives upon a similarly
                        splendid basis. In the last analysis, that would scarcely be called the
                        fault of the decorations, but rather of the innate trend of the mind. That
                        such a scene might stir the less expensively dressed to emulate the more
                        expensively dressed could scarcely be laid at the door of anything save the
                        false ambition of the minds of those so affected. Remove the element so
                        thoroughly and solely complained ofliquorand there would not be one to
                        gainsay the qualities of beauty and enthusiasm which would remain. The
                        pleased eye with which our modern restaurants of fashion are looked upon is
                        proof of this assertion.</p>
                    <p>Yet, here is the fact of the lighted chamber, the dressy, greedy company, the
                        small, self-interested palaver, the disorganized, aimless, wandering mental
                        action which it representsthe love of light and show and finery which, to
                        one outside, under the serene light of the eternal stars, must seem a
                        strange and shiny thing. Under the stars and sweeping night winds, what a
                        lamp-flower it must bloom; a strange, glittering night-flower,
                        odour-yielding, insect-drawing, insect-infested rose of pleasure.</p>
                    <p>&quot;See that fellow coming in there?&quot; said Hurstwood, glancing
                        at a gentleman just entering, arrayed in a high hat and Prince Albert coat,
                        his fat cheeks puffed and red as with good eating.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, where?&quot; said Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There,&quot; said Hurstwood, indicating the direction by a cast
                        of his ye, &quot;the man with the silk hat.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-060" n="54"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Drouet, now affecting not to see.
                        &quot;Who is he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s Jules Wallace, the spiritualist.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet followed him with his eyes, much interested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Doesn&apos;t look much like a man who sees spirits, does
                        he?&quot; said Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know,&quot; returned Hurstwood.
                        &quot;He&apos;s got the money, all right,&quot; and a little
                        twinkle passed over his eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t go much on those things, do you?&quot; asked
                        Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you never can tell,&quot; said Hurstwood. &quot;There
                        may be something to it. I wouldn&apos;t bother about it myself, though.
                        By the way,&quot; he added, &quot;are you going anywhere
                        to-night?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot; &apos;The Hole in the Ground,&apos; &quot; said
                        Drouet, mentioning the popular farce of the time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you&apos;d better be going. It&apos;s half after
                        eight already,&quot; and he drew out his watch.</p>
                    <p>The crowd was already thinning out considerablysome bound for the theatres,
                        some to their clubs, and some to that most fascinating of all the
                        pleasuresfor the type of man there represented, at leastthe ladies.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I will,&quot; said Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come around after the show. I have something I want to show
                        you,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure,&quot; said Drouet, elated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You haven&apos;t anything on hand for the night, have
                        you?&quot; added Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not a thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, come round, then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I struck a little peach coming in on the train Friday,&quot;
                        remarked Drouet, by way of parting. &quot;By George, that&apos;s so,
                        I must go and call on her before I go away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, never mind her,&quot; Hurstwood remarked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-061" n="55"/>
                    <p>&quot;Say, she was a little dandy, I tell you,&quot; went on Drouet
                        confidentially, and trying to impress his friend.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Twelve o&apos;clock,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; said Drouet, going out.</p>
                    <p>Thus was Carrie&apos;s name bandied about in the most frivolous and gay
                        of places, and that also when the little toiler was bemoaning her narrow
                        lot, which was almost inseparable from the early stages of this, her
                        unfolding fate.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE MACHINE AND THE MAIDEN: A KNIGHT OF TO-DAY</head>
                    <p>At the flat that evening Carrie felt a new phase of its atmosphere. The fact
                        that it was unchanged, while her feelings were different, increased her
                        knowledge of its character. Minnie, after the good spirits Carrie manifested
                        at first, expected a fair report. Hanson supposed that Carrie would be
                        satisfied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, as he came in from the hall in his working
                        clothes, and looked at Carrie through the dining-room door, &quot;how
                        did you make out?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Carrie, &quot;it&apos;s pretty hard. I
                        don&apos;t like it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was an air about her which showed plainer than any words that she was
                        both weary and disappointed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What sort of work is it?&quot; he asked, lingering a moment as
                        he turned upon his heel to go into the bathroom.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Running a machine,&quot; answered Carrie.</p>
                    <p>It was very evident that it did not concern him much, save from the side of
                        the flat&apos;s success. He was irritated a shade because it could not
                        have come about in the throw of fortune for Carrie to be pleased.</p>
                    <p>Minnie worked with less elation than she had just before Carrie arrived. The
                        sizzle of the meat frying did not sound quite so pleasing now that Carrie
                        had reported her discontent. To Carrie, the one relief of the whole day
                        would have been a jolly home, a sympathetic reception, a bright supper
                        table, and some one to say: &quot;Oh, well, stand it a little while. You
                        will get something better,&quot; <pb id="VAA2423-063" n="57"/> but now
                        this was ashes. She began to see that they looked upon her complaint as
                        unwarranted, and that she was supposed to work on and say nothing. She knew
                        that she was to pay four dollars for her board and room, and now she felt
                        that it would be an exceedingly gloomy round, living with these people.</p>
                    <p>Minnie was no companion for her sister---she was too old. Her thoughts were
                        staid and solemnly adapted to a condition. If Hanson had any pleasant
                        thoughts or happy feelings he concealed them. He seemed to do all his mental
                        operations without the aid of physical expression. He was as still as a
                        deserted chamber. Carrie, on the other hand, had the blood of youth and some
                        imagination. Her day of love and the mysteries of courtship were still
                        ahead. She could think of things she would like to do, of clothes she would
                        like to wear, and of places she would like to visit. These were the things
                        upon which her mind ran, and it was like meeting with opposition at every
                        turn to find no one here to call forth or respond to her feelings.</p>
                    <p>She had forgotten, in considering and explaining the result of her day, that
                        Drouet might come. Now, when she saw how unreceptive these two people were,
                        she hoped he would not. She did not know exactly what she would do or how
                        she would explain to Drouet, if he came. After supper she changed her
                        clothes. When she was trimly dressed she was rather a sweet little being,
                        with large eyes and a sad mouth. Her face expressed the mingled expectancy,
                        dissatisfaction, and depression she felt. She wandered about after the
                        dishes were put away, talked a little with Minnie, and then decided to go
                        down and stand in the door at the foot of the stairs. If Drouet came, she
                        could meet him there. Her face took on the semblance of a look of happiness
                        as she put on her hat to go below.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Carrie doesn&apos;t seem to like her place very well,&quot;
                        said <pb id="VAA2423-064" n="58"/> Minnie to her husband when the latter
                        came out, paper in hand, to sit in the dining-room a few minutes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She ought to keep it for a time, anyhow,&quot; said Hanson.
                        &quot;Has she gone downstairs?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Minnie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d tell her to keep it if I were you. She might be here
                        weeks without getting another one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Minnie said she would, and Hanson read his paper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I were you,&quot; he said a little later, &quot;I
                        wouldn&apos;t let her stand in the door down there. It don&apos;t
                        look good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll tell her,&quot; said Minnie.</p>
                    <p>The life of the streets continued for a long time to interest Carrie. She
                        never wearied of wondering where the people in the cars were going or what
                        their enjoyments were. Her imagination trod a very narrow round, always
                        winding up at points which concerned money, looks, clothes, or enjoyment.
                        She would have a far-off thought of Columbia City now and then, or an
                        irritating rush of feeling concerning her experiences of the present day,
                        but, on the whole, the little world about her enlisted her whole
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>The first floor of the building, of which Hanson&apos;s flat was the
                        third, was occupied by a bakery, and to this, while she was standing there,
                        Hanson came down to buy a loaf of bread. She was not aware of his presence
                        until he was quite near her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m after bread,&quot; was all he said as he
                        passed.</p>
                    <p>The contagion of thought here demonstrated itself. While Hanson really came
                        for bread, the thought dwelt with him that now he would see what Carrie was
                        doing. No sooner did he draw near her with that in mind than she felt it. Of
                        course, she had no understanding of what put it into her head, but,
                        nevertheless, it aroused in her the first shade of real antipathy to him.
                        She knew now that she did not like him. He was suspicious.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-065" n="59"/>
                    <p>A thought will colour a world for us. The flow of Carrie&apos;s
                        meditations had been disturbed, and Hanson had not long gone upstairs before
                        she followed. She had realised with the lapse of the quarter hours that
                        Drouet was not coming, and somehow she felt a little resentful, a little as
                        if she had been forsakenwas not good enough. She went upstairs, where
                        everything was silent. Minnie was sewing by a lamp at the table. Hanson had
                        already turned in for the night. In her weariness and disappointment Carrie
                        did no more than announce that she was going to bed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you&apos;d better,&quot; returned Minnie.
                        &quot;You&apos;ve got to get up early, you know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The morning was no better. Hanson was just going out the door as Carrie came
                        from her room. Minnie tried to talk with her during breakfast, but there was
                        not much of interest which they could mutually discuss. As on the previous
                        morning, Carrie walked down town, for she began to realise now that her
                        four-fifty would not even allow her car fare after she paid her board. This
                        seemed a miserable arrangement. But the morning light swept away the first
                        misgivings of the day, as morning light is ever wont to do.</p>
                    <p>At the shoe factory she put in a long day, scarcely so wearisome as the
                        preceding, but considerably less novel. The head foreman, on his round,
                        stopped by her machine.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where did you come from?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Brown hired me,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he did, eh!&quot; and then, &quot;See that you keep
                        things going.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The machine girls impressed her even less favourably. They seemed satisfied
                        with their lot, and were in a sense &quot;common.&quot; Carrie had
                        more imagination than they. She was not used to slang. Her instinct in the
                        matter <pb id="VAA2423-066" n="60"/> of dress was naturally better. She
                        disliked to listen to the girl next to her, who was rather hardened by
                        experience.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going to quit this,&quot; she heard her remark to
                        her neighbour. &quot;What with the stipend and being up late,
                        it&apos;s too much for me health.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They were free with the fellows, young and old, about the place, and
                        exchanged banter in rude phrases, which at first shocked her. She saw that
                        she was taken to be of the same sort and addressed accordingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello,&quot; remarked one of the stout-wristed sole-workers to
                        her at noon. &quot;You&apos;re a daisy.&quot; He really expected
                        to hear the common &quot;Aw! go chase yourself!&quot; in return, and
                        was sufficiently abashed, by Carrie&apos;s silently moving away, to
                        retreat, awkwardly grinning.</p>
                    <p>That night at the flat she was even more lonelythe dull situation was
                        becoming harder to endure. She could see that the Hansons seldom or never
                        had any company. Standing at the street door looking out, she ventured to
                        walk out a little stay. Her easy gait and idle manner attracted attention of
                        an offensive but common sort. She was slightly taken back at the overtures
                        of a well-dressed man of thirty, who in passing looked at her, reduced his
                        pace, turned back, and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Out for a little stroll, are you, this evening?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at him in amazement, and then summoned sufficient thought to
                        reply: &quot;Why, I don&apos;t know you,&quot; backing away as
                        she did so.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, that don&apos;t matter,&quot; said the other
                        affably.</p>
                    <p>She bandied no more words with him, but hurried away, reaching her own door
                        quite out of breath. There was something in the man&apos;s look which
                        frightened her.</p>
                    <p>During the remainder of the week it was very much the same. One or two nights
                        she found herself too tired to walk home, and expended car fare. She was not
                        very <pb id="VAA2423-067" n="61"/> strong, and sitting all day affected her
                        back. She went to bed one night before Hanson.</p>
                    <p>Transplantation is not always successful in the matter of flowers or maidens.
                        It requires sometimes a richer soil, a better atmosphere to continue even a
                        natural growth. It would have been better if her acclimatization had been
                        more gradualless rigid. She would have done better if she had not secured a
                        position so quickly, and had seen more of the city which she constantly
                        troubled to know about.</p>
                    <p>On the first morning it rained she found that she had no umbrella. Minnie
                        loaned her one of hers, which was worn and faded. There was the kind of
                        vanity in Carrie that troubled at this. She went to one of the great
                        department stores and bought herself one, using a dollar and a quarter of
                        her small store to pay for it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did you do that for, Carrie?&quot; asked Minnie, when she
                        saw it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I need one,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You foolish girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie resented this, though she did not reply. She was not going to be a
                        common shop-girl, she thought; they need not think it, either.</p>
                    <p>On the first Saturday night Carrie paid her board, four dollars. Minnie had a
                        quaver of conscience as she took it, but did not know how to explain to
                        Hanson if she took less. That worthy gave up just four dollars less toward
                        the household expenses with a smile of satisfaction. He contemplated
                        increasing his Building and Loan payment. As for Carrie, she studied over
                        the problem of finding clothes and amusement on fifty cents a week. She
                        brooded over this until she was in a state of mental rebellion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going up the street for a walk,&quot; she said
                        after supper.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-068" n="62"/>
                    <p>&quot;Not alone, are you?&quot; asked Hanson.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; returned Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t,&quot; said Minnie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to see <hi rend="i">something</hi>,&quot; said Carrie,
                        and by the tone she put into the last word they realised for the first time
                        she was not pleased with them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter with her?&quot; asked Hanson, when
                        she went into the front room to get her hat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Minnie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, she ought to know better than to want to go out
                        alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie did not go very far, after all. She returned and stood in the door.
                        The next day they went out to Garfield Park, but it did not please her. She
                        did not look well enough. In the shop next day she heard the highly coloured
                        reports which girls give of their trivial amusements. They had been happy.
                        On several days it rained and she used up car fare. One night she got
                        thoroughly soaked, going to catch the car at Van Buren Street. All that
                        evening she sat alone in the front room looking out upon the street, where
                        the lights were reflected on the wet pavements, thinking. She had
                        imagination enough to be moody.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday she paid another four dollars and pocketed her fifty cents in
                        despair. The speaking acquaintanceship which she formed with some of the
                        girls at the shop discovered to her the fact that they had more of their
                        earnings to use for themselves than she did. They had young men of the kind
                        whom she, since her experience with Drouet, felt above, who took them about.
                        She came to thoroughly dislike the light-headed young fellows of the shop.
                        Not one of them had a show of refinement. She saw only their workday
                        side.</p>
                    <p>There came a day when the first premonitory blast of winter swept over the
                        city. It scudded the fleecy clouds <pb id="VAA2423-069" n="63"/> in the
                        heavens, trailed long, thin streamers of smoke from the tall stacks, and
                        raced about the streets and corners in sharp and sudden puffs. Carrie now
                        felt the problem of winter clothes. What was she to do? She had no winter
                        jacket, no hat, no shoes. It was difficult to speak to Minnie about this,
                        but at last she summoned the courage.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m going to do about
                        clothes,&quot; she said one evening when they were together. &quot;I
                        need a hat&quot;.</p>
                    <p>Minnie looked serious.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you keep part of your money and buy yourself
                        one? &quot; she suggested, worried over the situation which the
                        withholding of Carrie&apos;s money would create.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d like to for a week or so, if you don&apos;t
                        mind,&quot; ventured Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Could you pay two dollars?&quot; asked Minnie.</p>
                    <p>Carrie readily acquiesced, glad to escape the trying situation, and liberal
                        now that she saw a way out. She was elated and began figuring at once. She
                        needed a hat first of all. How Minnie explained to Hanson she never knew. He
                        said nothing at all, but there were thoughts in the air which left
                        disagreeable impressions.</p>
                    <p>The new arrangement might have worked if sickness had not intervened. It blew
                        up cold after a rain one afternoon when Carrie was still without a jacket.
                        She came out of the warm shop at six and shivered as the wind struck her. In
                        the morning she was sneezing, and going down town made it worse. That day
                        her bones ached and she felt light-headed. Towards evening she felt very
                        ill, and when she reached home was not hungry. Minnie noticed her drooping
                        actions and asked her about herself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;I feel real
                        bad.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She hung about the stove, suffered a chattering chill, and went to bed sick.
                        The next morning she was thoroughly feverish.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-070" n="64"/>
                    <p>Minnie was truly distressed at this, but maintained a kindly demeanour.
                        Hanson said perhaps she had better go back home for a while. When she got up
                        after three days, it was taken for granted that her position was lost. The
                        winter was near at hand she had no clothes, and now she was out of work.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Carrie;
                        &quot;I&apos;ll go down Monday and see if I can&apos;t get
                        something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>If anything, her efforts were more poorly rewarded on this trial than the
                        last. Her clothes were nothing suitable for fall wearing. Her last money she
                        had spent for a hat. For three days she wandered about, utterly dispirited.
                        The attitude of the flat was fast becoming unbearable. She hated to think of
                        going back there each evening. Hanson was so cold. She knew it could not
                        last much longer. Shortly she would have to give up and go home.</p>
                    <p>On the fourth day she was down town all day, having borrowed ten cents for
                        lunch from Minnie. She had applied in the cheapest kind of places without
                        success. She even answered for waitress in a small restaurant where she saw
                        a card in the window, but they wanted an experienced girl. She moved through
                        the thick throng of strangers, utterly subdued in spirit. Suddenly a hand
                        pulled her arm and turned her about.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, well!&quot; said a voice. In the first glance she beheld
                        Drouet. He was not only rosy-cheeked, but radiant. He was the essence of
                        sunshine and good-humour. &quot;Why, how are you, Carrie?&quot; he
                        said. &quot;You&apos;re a daisy. Where have you been?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie smiled under his irresistible flood of geniality.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve been out home,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I saw you across the street
                        there. I thought it was you. I was just coming out to your place. How are
                        you, anyhow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m all right,&quot; said Carrie, smiling.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-071" n="65"/>
                    <p>Drouet looked her over and saw something different.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I want to talk to you.
                        You&apos;re not going anywhere in particular, are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not just now,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s go up here and have something to eat. George! but
                        I&apos;m glad to see you again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She felt to relieved in his radiant presence, so much looked after and cared
                        for, that she assented gladly, though with the slightest air of holding
                        back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, as he took her armand there was an
                        exuberance of good-fellowship in the word which fairly warmed the cockles of
                        her heart.</p>
                    <p>They went through Monroe Street to the old Windsor dining-room, which was
                        then a large, comfortable place, with an excellent cuisine and substantial
                        service. Drouet selected a table close by the window, where the busy rout of
                        the street could be seen. He loved the changing panorama of the streetto see
                        and be seen as he dined.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now,&quot; he said, getting Carrie and himself comfortably
                        settled, &quot;what will you have?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked over the large bill of fare which the waiter handed her without
                        really considering it. She was very hungry, and the things she saw there
                        awakened her desires, but the high prices held her attention. &quot;Half
                        broiled spring chickenseventy-five. Sirloin steak with mushroomsone
                        twenty-five.&quot; She had dimly heard of these things, but it seemed
                        strange to be called to order from the list.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll fix this,&quot;exclaimed Drouet. &quot;Sst!
                        waiter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>That officer of the board, a full-chested, round-faced negro, approached, and
                        inclined his ear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sirloin with mushrooms,&quot; said Drouet. &quot;Stuffed
                        tomatoes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yassah,&quot; assented the negro, nodding his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hashed brown potatoes.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-072" n="66"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yassah.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Asparagus.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yassah.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And a pot of coffee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet turned to Carrie. &quot;I haven&apos;t had a thing since
                        breakfast. Just got in from Rock Island. I was going off to dine when I saw
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie smiled and smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What have you been doing?&quot; he went on. &quot;Tell me
                        all about yourself. How is your sister?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s well,&quot; returned Carrie, answering the last
                        query. He looked at her hard.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say,&quot; he said, &quot;you haven&apos;t been sick,
                        have you?&quot; Carrie nodded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, now, that&apos;s a blooming shame, isn&apos;t it? You
                        don&apos;t look very well. I thought you looked a little pale. What have
                        you been doing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Working,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t say so! At what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She told him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rhodes, Morgenthau and Scottwhy, I know that house. Over here on
                        Fifth Avenue, isn&apos;t it? They&apos;re a close-fisted concern.
                        What made you go there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t get anything else,&quot; said Carrie
                        frankly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s an outrage,&quot; said Drouet.
                        &quot;You oughtn&apos;t to be working for those people. Have the
                        factory right back of the store, don&apos;t they?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That isn&apos;t a good house,&quot; said Drouet.
                        &quot;You don&apos;t want to work at anything like that,
                        anyhow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He chattered on at a great rate, asking questions, explaining things about
                        himself, telling her what a good restaurant it was, until the waiter
                        returned with an immense tray, bearing the hot savoury dishes which had been
                        ordered. Drouet fairly shone in the matter of serving. <pb id="VAA2423-073"
                            n="67"/> He appeared to great advantage behind the white napery and
                        silver platters of the table and displaying his arms with a knife and fork.
                        As he cut the meat his rings almost spoke. His new suit creaked as he
                        stretched to reach the plates, break the bread, and pour the coffee. He
                        helped Carrie to a rousing plateful and contributed the warmth of his spirit
                        to her body until she was a new girl. He was a splendid fellow in the true
                        popular understanding of the term, and captivated Carrie completely.</p>
                    <p>That little soldier of fortune took her good turn in an easy way. She felt a
                        little out of place, but the great room soothed her and the view of the
                        well-dressed throng out-side seemed a splendid thing. Ah, what was it not to
                        have money! What a thing it was to lie able to come in here and dine! Drouet
                        must be fortunate. He rode on trains, dressed in such nice clothes, was so
                        strong, and ate in these fine places. He seemed quite a figure of a man, and
                        she wondered at his friendship and regard for her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you lost your place because you got sick, eh?&quot; hesaid.
                        &quot;What are you going to do now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look around,&quot; she said, a thought of the need that hung
                        outside this fine restaurant like a hungry dog at her heels passing into her
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Drouet, &quot;that won&apos;t do.
                        How long have you been looking?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Four days,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Think of that!&quot; he said, addressing some problematical
                        individual. &quot;You oughtn&apos;t to be doing anything like that.
                        These girls.&quot; and he waved an inclusion of all shop and factory
                        girls, &quot;don&apos;t get anything. Why, you can&apos;t live
                        on it, can you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was a brotherly sort of creature in his demeanour. When he had scouted the
                        idea of that kind of toil, he took another tack. Carrie was really very
                        pretty. Even then, <pb id="VAA2423-074" n="68"/> in her commonplace garb,
                        her figure was evidently not bad, and her eyes were large and gentle. Drouet
                        looked at her and his thoughts reached home. She felt his admiration. It was
                        powerfully backed by his liberality and good-humour. She felt that she liked
                        himthat she could continue to like him ever so much. There was something
                        even richer than that, running as a hidden strain, in her mind. Every little
                        while her eyes would meet his, and by that means the interchanging current
                        of feeling would be fully connected.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you stay down town and go to the theatre with
                        me?&quot; he said, hitching his chair closer. The table was not very
                        wide.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I can&apos;t,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you going to do to-night?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; she answered, a little drearily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t like out there where you are, do
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you going to do if you don&apos;t get
                        work?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go back home, I guess.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was the least quaver in her voice as she said this. Somehow, the
                        influence he was exerting was powerful. They came to an understanding of
                        each other without wordshe of her situation, she of the fact that he
                        realised it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;you can&apos;t make
                        it!&quot; genuine sympathy filling his mind for the time. &quot;Let
                        me help you. You take some of my money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no!&quot; she said, leaning back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>She sat meditating, merely shaking her head.</p>
                    <p>He looked at her quite tenderly for his kind. There were some loose bills in
                        his vest pocketgreenbacks. They were soft and noiseless, and he got his
                        fingers about them and crumpled them up in his hand.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-075" n="69"/>
                    <p>&quot;Come on,&quot; he said, &quot;I&apos;ll see you through
                        all right. Get yourself some clothes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was the first reference he had made to that subject, and now she realised
                        how bad off she was. In his crude way he had struck the key-note. Her lips
                        trembled a little.</p>
                    <p>She had her hand out on the table before her. They were quite alone in their
                        corner, and he put his larger, warmer hand over it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ate, come, Carrie,&quot; he said, &quot;what can you do
                        alone? Let me help you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He pressed her hand gently and she tried to withdraw it. At this he held it
                        fast, and she no longer protested. Then he slipped the greenbacks he had
                        into her palm, and when she began to protest, he whispered:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll loan it to youthat&apos;s all right.
                        I&apos;ll loan it to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He made her take it. She felt bound to him by a strange tie of affection now.
                        They went out, and he walked with her far out south toward Polk Street,
                        talking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t want to live with those people?&quot; he
                        said in one place, abstractedly. Carrie heard it, but it made only a slight
                        impression.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come down and meet me to-morrow,&quot; he said, &quot;and
                        we&apos;ll go to the matine. Will you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie protested a while, but acquiesced.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re not doing anything. Get yourself a nice pair of
                        shoes and a jacket.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She scarcely gave a thought to the complication which would trouble her when
                        he was gone. In his presence, she was of his own hopeful, easy-way-out
                        mood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you bother about those people out there,&quot;
                        he said at parting. &quot;I&apos;ll help you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie left him, feeling as though a great arm had slipped out before her to
                        draw off trouble. The money she had accepted was two soft, green, handsome
                        ten-dollar bills.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE LURE OF THE MATERIAL: BEAUTY SPEAKS FOR ITSELF</head>
                    <p>The true meaning of money yet remains to be popularly explained and
                        comprehended. When each individual realises for himself that this thing
                        primarily stands for and should only be accepted as a moral duethat it
                        should be paid out as honestly stored energy, and not as a usurped
                        privilegemany of our social, religious, and political troubles will have
                        permanently passed. As for Carrie, her understanding of the moral
                        significance of money was the popular understanding, nothing more. The old
                        definition: &quot;Money: something everybody else has and I must
                        get,&quot; would have expressed her understanding of it thoroughly. Some
                        of it she now held in her handtwo soft, green ten-dollar billsand she felt
                        that she was immensely better off for the having of them. It was something
                        that was power in itself. One of her order of mind would have been content
                        to be cast away upon a desert island with a bundle of money, and only the
                        long strain of starvation would have taught her that in some cases it could
                        have no value. Even then she would have had no conception of the relative
                        value of the thing; her one thought would, undoubtedly, have concerned the
                        pity of having so much power and the inability to use it.</p>
                    <p>The poor girl thrilled as she walked away from Drouet. She felt ashamed in
                        part because she had been weak enough to take it, but her need was so dire,
                        she was still <pb id="VAA2423-077" n="71"/> glad. Now she would have a nice
                        new jacket! Now she would buy a nice pair of pretty button shoes. She would
                        get stockings, too, and a skirt, and, anduntil already, as in the matter of
                        her prospective salary, she had got beyond, in her desires, twice the
                        purchasing power of her bills.</p>
                    <p>She conceived a true estimate of Drouet. To her, and indeed to all the world,
                        he was a nice, good-hearted man. There was nothing evil in the fellow. He
                        gave her the money out of a good heartout of a realisation of her want. He
                        would not have given the same amount to a poor young man, but we must not
                        forget that a poor young man could not, in the nature of things, have
                        appealed to him like a poor young girl. Femininity affected his feelings. He
                        was the creature of an inborn desire. Yet no beggar could have caught his
                        eye and said, &quot;My God, mister, I&apos;m starving,&quot; but
                        he would gladly have handed out what was considered the proper portion to
                        give beggars and thought no more about it. There would have been no
                        speculation, no philosophising. He had no mental process in him worthy the
                        dignity of either of those terms. In his good clothes and fine health, he
                        was a merry, unthinking moth of the lamp. Deprived of his position, and
                        struck by a few of the involved and baffling forces which sometimes play
                        upon man, he would have been as helpless as Carrieas helpless, as
                        non-understanding, as pitiable, if you will, as she.</p>
                    <p>Now, in regard to his pursuit of women, he meant them no harm, because he did
                        not conceive of the relation which he hoped to hold with them as being
                        harmful. He loved to make advances to women, to have them succumb to his
                        charms, not because he was a cold-blooded, dark, scheming villain, but
                        because his inborn desire urged him to that as a chief delight. He was vain,
                        he was boastful, he was as deluded by fine clothes as any silly-headed girl.
                            <pb id="VAA2423-078" n="72"/> A truly deep-dyed villain could have
                        hornswaggled him as readily as he could have flattered a pretty shop-girl.
                        His fine success as a salesman lay in his geniality and the thoroughly
                        reputable standing of his house. He bobbed about among men, a veritable
                        bundle of enthusiasmno power worthy the name of intellect, no thoughts
                        worthy the adjective noble, no feelings long continued in one strain. A
                        Madame Sappho would have called him a pig; a Shakespeare would have said
                        &quot;my merry child;&quot; old, drinking Caryoe thought him a
                        clever, successful business man. In short, he was as good as his intellect
                        conceived.</p>
                    <p>The best proof that there was something open and commendable about the man
                        was the fact that Carrie took the money. No deep, sinister soul with
                        ulterior motives could have given her fifteen cents under the guise of
                        friendship. The unintellectual are not so helpless. Nature has taught the
                        beasts of the field to fly when some unheralded danger threatens. She has
                        put into the small, unwise head of the chipmunk the untutored fear of
                        poisons. &quot;He keepeth His creatures whole,&quot; was not written
                        of beasts alone. Carrie was unwise, and, therefore, like the sheep in its
                        unwisdom, strong in feeling. The instinct of self-protection, strong in all
                        such natures, was roused but feebly, if at all, by the overtures of
                        Drouet.</p>
                    <p>When Carrie had gone, he felicitated himself upon her good opinion. By
                        George, it was a shame young girls had to be knocked around like that. Cold
                        weather coming on and no clothes. Tough. He would go around to Fitzgerald
                        and Moy&apos;s and get a cigar. It made him feel light of foot as he
                        thought about her.</p>
                    <p>Carrie reached home in high good spirits, which she could scarcely conceal.
                        The possession of the money involved a number of points which perplexed her
                        seriously. How should she buy any clothes when Minnie knew that she had no
                        money? She had no sooner entered the flat <pb id="VAA2423-079" n="73"/> than
                        this point was settled for her. It could not be done. She could think of no
                        way of explaining.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did you come out?&quot; asked Minnie, referring to the
                        day.</p>
                    <p>Carrie had none of the small deception which could feel one thing and say
                        something directly opposed. She would prevaricate, but it would be in the
                        line of her feelings at least. So instead of complaining when she felt so
                        good, she said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have the promise of something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;At the Boston Store.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it sure promised?&quot; questioned Minnie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m to find out to-morrow,&quot; returned
                        Carrie, disliking to draw out a lie any longer than was necessary.</p>
                    <p>Minnie felt the atmosphere of good feeling which Carrie brought with her. She
                        felt now was the time to express to Carrie the state of Hanson&apos;s
                        feeling about her entire Chicago venture.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you shouldn&apos;t get it&quot; she paused, troubled for
                        an easy way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I don&apos;t get something pretty soon, I think
                        I&apos;ll go home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Minnie saw her chance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sven thinks it might be best for the winter, anyhow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The situation flashed on Carrie at once. They were unwilling to keep her any
                        longer, out of work. She did not blame Minnie, she did not blame Hanson very
                        much. Now, as she sat there digesting the remark, she was glad she had
                        Drouet&apos;s money.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said after a few moments, &quot;I thought of
                        doing that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not explain that the thought, however, had aroused all the antagonism
                        of her nature. Columbia City, what was there for her? She knew its dull,
                        little <pb id="VAA2423-080" n="74"/> round by heart. Here was the great,
                        mysterious city which was still a magnet for her. What she had seen only
                        suggested its possibilities. Now to turn back on it and live the little old
                        life out thereshe almost exclaimed against the thought.</p>
                    <p>She had reached home early and went in the front room to think. What could
                        she do? She could not buy new shoes and wear them here. She would need to
                        save part of the twenty to pay her fare home. She did not want to borrow of
                        Minnie for that. And yet, how could she explain where she even got that
                        money? If she could only get enough to let her out easy.</p>
                    <p>She went over the tangle again and again. Here, in the morning, Drouet would
                        expect to see her in a new jacket, and that couldn&apos;t be. The
                        Hansons expected her to go home, and she wanted to get away, and yet she did
                        not want to go home. In the light of the way they would look on her getting
                        money without work, the taking of it now seemed dreadful. She began to be
                        ashamed. The whole situation depressed her. It was all so clear when she was
                        with Drouet. Now it was all so tangled, so hopelessmuch worse than it was
                        before, because she had the semblance of aid in her hand which she could not
                        use.</p>
                    <p>Her spirits sank so that at supper Minnie felt that she must have had another
                        hard day. Carrie finally decided that she would give the money back. It was
                        wrong to take it. She would go down in the morning and hunt for work. At
                        noon she would meet Drouet as agreed and tell him. At this decision her
                        heart sank, until she was the old Carrie of distress.</p>
                    <p>Curiously, she could not hold the money in her hand without feeling some
                        relief. Even after all her depressing conclusions, she could sweep away all
                        thought about the matter and then the twenty dollars seemed a wonderful and
                        delightful thing. Ah, money, money, money! What <pb id="VAA2423-081" n="75"
                        /> a thing it was to have. How plenty of it would clear away all these
                        troubles.</p>
                    <p>In the morning she got up and started out a little early. Her decision to
                        hunt for work was moderately strong, but the money in her pocket, after all
                        her troubling over it, made the work question the least shade less terrible.
                        She walked into the wholesale district, but as the thought of applying came
                        with each passing concern, her heart shrank. What a coward she was, she
                        thought to herself. Yet she had applied so often. It would be the same old
                        story. She walked on and on, and finally did go into one place, with the old
                        result. She came out feeling that luck was against her. It was no use.</p>
                    <p>Without much thinking, she reached Dearborn Street. Here was the great Fair
                        store with its multitude of delivery wagons about, its long window display,
                        its crowd of shoppers. It readily changed her thoughts, she who was so weary
                        of them. It was here that she had intended to come and get her new things.
                        Now for relief from distress; she thought she would go in and see. She would
                        look at the jackets.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing in this world more delightful than that middle state in
                        which we mentally balance at times, possessed of the means, lured by desire,
                        and yet deterred by conscience or want of decision. When Carrie began
                        wandering around the store amid the fine displays she was in this mood. Her
                        original experience in this same place had given her a high opinion of its
                        merits. Now she paused at each individual bit of finery, where before she
                        had hurried on. Her woman&apos;s heart was warm with desire for them.
                        How would she looks in this, how charming that would make her! She came upon
                        the corset counter and paused in rich reverie as she noted the dainty
                        concoctions of colour and lace there displayed. If she would only make up
                        her mind, she could have one of <pb id="VAA2423-082" n="76"/> those now. She
                        lingered in the jewelry department. She saw the earrings, the bracelets, the
                        pins, the chains. What would she not have given if she could have had them
                        all! She would look fine too, if only she had some of these things.</p>
                    <p>The jackets were the greatest attraction. When she entered the store, she
                        already had her heart fixed upon the peculiar little tan jacket with large
                        mother-of-pearl buttons which was all the rage that fall. Still she
                        delighted to convince herself that there was nothing she would like better.
                        She went about among the glass cases and racks where these things were
                        displayed, and satisfied herself that the one she thought of was the proper
                        one. All the time she wavered in mind, now persuading herself that she could
                        buy it right away if she chose, now recalling to herself the actual
                        condition. At last the noon hour was dangerously near, and she had done
                        nothing. She must go now and return the money.</p>
                    <p>Drouet was on the corner when she came up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello,&quot; he said, &quot;where is the jacket and
                        &quot;looking down&quot;the shoes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie had thought to lead up to her decision in some intelligent way, but
                        this swept the whole fore-schemed situation by the board.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I came to tell you thatthat I can&apos;t take the
                        money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, that&apos;s it, is it?&quot; he returned.
                        &quot;Well, you come on with me. Let&apos;s go over here to
                        Partridge&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie walked with him. Behold, the whole fabric of doubt and impossibility
                        had slipped from her mind. She could not get at the points that were no
                        serious, the things she was going to make plain to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you had lunch yet? Of course you haven&apos;t.
                        Let&apos;s go in here,&quot; and Drouet turned into one of the very
                        nicely furnished restaurants off State Street, in Monroe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mustn&apos;t take the money,&quot; said Carrie, after
                        they <pb id="VAA2423-083" n="77"/> were settled in a cosey corner, and
                        Drouet had ordered the lunch. &quot;I can&apos;t wear those things
                        out there. They they wouldn&apos;t know where I got them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you want to do,&quot; he smiled, &quot;go without
                        them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I&apos;ll go home,&quot; she said, wearily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, come,&quot; he said, &quot;you&apos;ve been
                        thinking it over too long. I&apos;ll tell you what you do. You say you
                        can&apos;t wear them out there. Why don&apos;t you rent a furnished
                        room and leave them in that for a week?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie shook her head. Like all women, she was there to object and be
                        convinced. It was for him to brush the doubts away and clear the path if he
                        could.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why are you going home?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I can&apos;t get anything here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They won&apos;t keep you?&quot; he remarked,
                        intuitively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They can&apos;t,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll tell you what you do,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;You come with me. I&apos;ll take care of you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie heard this passively. The peculiar state which she was in made it
                        sound like the welcome breath of an open door. Drouet seemed of her own
                        spirit and pleasing. He was clean, handsome, well-dressed, and sympathetic.
                        His voice was the voice of a friend.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What can you do back at Columbia City?&quot; he went on,
                        rousing by the words in Carrie&apos;s mind a picture of the dull world
                        site had left. &quot;There isn&apos;t anything down there.
                        Chicago&apos;s the place. You can get a nice room here and some clothes,
                        and then you can do something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked out through the window into the busy street. There it was, the
                        admirable, great city, so fine when you are not poor. An elegant coach, with
                        a prancing pair of bays, passed by, carrying in its upholstered depths a
                        young lady.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What will you have if you go back? &quot;asked Drouet.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-084" n="78"/>
                    <p>There was no subtle undercurrent to the question. He imagined that she would
                        have nothing at all of the things he thought worth while.</p>
                    <p>Carrie sat still, looking out. She was wondering what she could do. They
                        would be expecting her to go home this week.</p>
                    <p>Drouet turned to the subject of the clothes she was going to buy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not get yourself a nice little jacket? You&apos;ve got to
                        have it. I&apos;ll loan you the money. You needn&apos;t worry about
                        taking it. You can get yourself a nice room by yourself. I won&apos;t
                        hurt you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie saw the drift, but could not express her thoughts. She felt more than
                        ever the helplessness of her case.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I could only get something to do,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe you can,&quot; went on Drouet, &quot;if you stay
                        here. You can&apos;t if you go away. They won&apos;t let you stay
                        out there. Now, why not let me get you a nice room? I won&apos;t bother
                        youyou needn&apos;t be afraid. Then, when you get fixed up, maybe you
                        could get something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her pretty face and it vivified his mental resources. She was a
                        sweet little mortal to himthere was no doubt of that. She seemed to have
                        some power back of her actions. She was not like the common rim of
                        store-girls. She wasn&apos;t silly.</p>
                    <p>In reality, Carrie had more imagination than hemore taste. It was a finer
                        mental strain in her that made possible her depression and loneliness. Her
                        poor clothes were neat, and she held her head unconsciously in a dainty
                        way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think I could get something?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure,&quot; he said, reaching over and filling her cup with
                        tea. &quot;I&apos;ll help you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him, and he laughed reassuringly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now I&apos;ll tell you what we&apos;ll do. We&apos;ll
                        go over here to Partridge&apos;s and you pick out what you want. Then
                            <pb id="VAA2423-085" n="79"/> we&apos;ll look around for a room for
                        you. You can leave the things there. Then we&apos;ll go to the show
                        to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you can go out to the flat then, that&apos;s all right.
                        You don&apos;t need to stay in the room. Just take it and leave your
                        things there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She hung in doubt about this until the dinner was over.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s go over and look at the jackets,&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>Together they went. In the store they found that shine and rustle of new
                        things which immediately laid hold of Carrie&apos;s heart. Under the
                        influence of a good dinner and Drouet&apos;s radiating presence, the
                        scheme proposed seemed feasible. She looked about and picked a jacket like
                        the one which she had admired at The Fair. When she got it in her hand it
                        seemed so much nicer. The saleswoman helped her on with it, and, by
                        accident, it fitted perfectly. Drouet&apos;s face lightened as he saw
                        the improvement. She looked quite smart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the thing,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Carrie turned before the glass. She could not help feeling pleased as she
                        looked at herself. A warm glow crept into her cheeks.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the thing,&quot; said Drouet. &quot;Now pay
                        for it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Its nine dollars,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s all righttake it,&quot; said Drouet.</p>
                    <p>She reached in her purse and took out one of the bills. The woman asked if
                        she would wear the coat and went off. In a few minutes she was back and the
                        purchase was closed.</p>
                    <p>From Partridge&apos;s they went to a shoe store, where Carrie was fitted
                        for shoes. Drouet stood by, and when he saw how nice they looked, said,
                        &quot;Wear them.&quot; Carrie shook her head, however. She was
                        thinking of returning to the flat. He bought her a purse for one thing, <pb
                            id="VAA2423-086" n="80"/> and a pair of gloves for another, and let her
                        buy the stockings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To-morrow,&quot; he said, &quot;you come down here and buy
                        yourself a skirt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In all of Carrie&apos;s actions there was a touch of misgiving. The
                        deeper she sank into the entanglement, the more she imagined that the thing
                        hung upon the few remaining things she had not done. Since she had not done
                        these, there was a way out.</p>
                    <p>Drouet knew a place in Wabash Avenue where there were rooms. He showed Carrie
                        the outside of these, and said: &quot;Now, you&apos;re my
                        sister.&quot; He carried the arrangement off with an easy hand when it
                        came to the selection, looking around, criticising, opining. &quot;Her
                        trunk will be here in a day or so,&quot; he observed to the landlady,
                        who was very pleased.</p>
                    <p>When they were alone, Drouet did not change in the least. He talked in the
                        same general way as if they were out in the street. Carrie left her
                        things.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Drouet, &quot;why don&apos;t you move
                        to-night?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I can&apos;t,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to leave them so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took that up as they walked along the avenue. It was a warm afternoon. The
                        sun had come out and the wind had died down. As he talked with Carrie, he
                        secured an accurate detail of the atmosphere of the flat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come out of it,&quot; he said, &quot;they won&apos;t
                        care. I&apos;ll help you get along.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She listened until her misgivings vanished. He would show her about a little
                        and then help her get something. He really imagined that he would. He would
                        be out on the road and she could be working.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, I&apos;ll tell you what you do,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;you go out there and get whatever you want and come
                        away.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-087" n="81"/>
                    <p>She thought a long time about this. Finally she agreed. He would come out as
                        far as Peoria Street and wait for her. She was to meet him at half-past
                        eight. At half-past five she reached home, and at six her determination was
                        hardened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you didn&apos;t get it?&quot; said Minnie, referring to
                        Carrie&apos;s story of the Boston Store.</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at her out of the corner of her eye. &quot;No,&quot;
                        she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think you&apos;d better try any more this
                        fall,&quot; said Minnie.</p>
                    <p>Carrie said nothing.</p>
                    <p>When Hanson came home he wore the same inscrutable demeanour. He washed in
                        silence and went off to read his paper. At dinner Carrie felt a little
                        nervous. The strain of her own plans was considerable, and the feeling that
                        she was not welcome here was strong.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t find anything, eh?&quot; said Hanson.</p>
                    <p>&quot;NO.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned to his eating again, the thought that it was a burden to have her
                        here dwelling in his mind. She would have to go home, that was all. Once she
                        was away, there would be no more coming back in the spring.</p>
                    <p>Carrie was afraid of what she was going to do, but she was relieved to know
                        that this condition was ending. They would not care. Hanson particularly
                        would be glad when she went. He would not care what became of her.</p>
                    <p>After dinner she went into the bathroom, where they could not disturb her,
                        and wrote a little note.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-bye, Minnie,&quot; it read. &quot;I&apos;m not
                        going home. I&apos;m going to stay in Chicago a little while and look
                        for work. Don&apos;t worry. I&apos;ll be all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the front room Hanson was reading his paper. As usual, she helped Minnie
                        clear away the dishes and straighten up. Then site said:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-088" n="82"/>
                    <p>&quot;I guess I&apos;ll stand down at the door a little
                        while.&quot; She could scarcely prevent her voice from trembling.</p>
                    <p>Minnie remembered Hanson&apos;s remonstrance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sven doesn&apos;t think it looks good to stand down
                        there,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Doesn&apos;t he?&quot; said Carrie. &quot;I
                        won&apos;t do it any more after this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She put on her hat and fidgeted around the table in the little bedroom,
                        wondering where to slip the note. Finally she put it under Minnie&apos;s
                        hair-brush.</p>
                    <p>When she had closed the hall-door, she paused a moment and wondered what they
                        would think. Some thought of the queerness of her deed affected her. She
                        went slowly down the stairs. She looked back up the lighted step, and then
                        affected to stroll up the street. When she reached the corner she quickened
                        her pace.</p>
                    <p>As she was hurrying away, Hanson came back to his wife.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is Carrie down at the door again?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Minnie; &quot;she said she wasn&apos;t
                        going to do it any more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went over to the baby where it was playing on the floor and began to poke
                        his finger at it.</p>
                    <p>Drouet was on the corner waiting, in good spirits.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello, Carrie,&quot; he said, as a sprightly figure of a girl
                        drew near him. &quot;Got here safe, did you? Well, we&apos;ll take a
                        car.&quot;</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">INTIMATIONS BY WINTER: AN AMBASSADOR SUMMONED</head>
                    <p>Among the forces which sweep and play throughout the universe, untutored man
                        is but a wisp in the wind. Our civilisation is still in a middle stage,
                        scarcely beast, in that it is no longer wholly guided by instinct; scarcely
                        human, in that it is not yet wholly guided by reason. On the tiger no
                        responsibility rests. We see hint aligned by nature with the forces of
                        lifehe is born into their keeping and without thought he is protected. We
                        see man far removed from the lairs of the jungles, his innate instincts
                        dulled by too near an approach to free-will, his free-will not sufficiently
                        developed to replace his instincts and afford him perfect guidance. He is
                        becoming too wise to hearken always to instincts and desires; he is still
                        too weak to always prevail against them. As a beast, the forces of life
                        aligned him with them; as a man, he has not yet wholly learned to align
                        himself with the forces. In this intermediate stage he waversneither drawn
                        in harmony with nature by his instincts nor yet wisely putting himself into
                        harmony by his own free-will. He is even as a wisp in the wind, moved by
                        every breath of passion, acting now by his will and now by his instincts,
                        erring with one, only to retrieve by the other, falling by one, only to rise
                        by the othera creature of incalculable variability. We have the consolation
                        of knowing that evolution is ever in action, that the ideal is a light that
                        cannot fail. He will not forever balance thus between good and evil. When
                            <pb id="VAA2423-090" n="84"/> this jangle of free-will and instinct
                        shall have been adjusted, when perfect understanding has given the former
                        the power to replace the latter entirely, man will no longer vary. The
                        needle of understanding will yet point steadfast and unwavering to the
                        distant pole of truth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In Carrieas in how many of our worldlings do they not?instinct and
                        reason, desire and understanding, were at war for the mastery. She followed
                        whither her craving led. She was as yet more drawn than she drew.</p>
                    <p>When Minnie found the note next morning, after a night of mingled wonder and
                        anxiety, which was not exactly touched by yearning, sorrow, or love, she
                        exclaimed:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what do you think of that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot; said Hanson.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sister Carrie has gone to live somewhere else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hanson jumped out of bed with more celerity than he usually displayed and
                        looked at the note. The only indication of his thoughts came in the form of
                        a little clicking sound made by his tongue; the sound some people make when
                        they wish to urge on a horse.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where do you suppose she&apos;s gone to?&quot; said Minnie,
                        thoroughly aroused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; a touch of cynicism lighting his
                        eye. &quot;Now she has gone and done it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Minnie moved her head in a puzzled way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, oh,&quot; she said, &quot;she doesn&apos;t know
                        what she has done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Hanson, after a while, sticking his hands out
                        before him, &quot;what can you do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Minnie&apos;s womanly nature was higher than this. She figured the
                        possibilities in such cases.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she said at last, &quot;poor Sister
                        Carrie!&quot;</p>
                    <p>At the time of this particular conversation, which occurred at 5 A. M., that
                        little soldier of fortune was sleeping a rather troubled sleep in her new
                        room, alone.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-091" n="85"/>
                    <p>Carrie&apos;s new state was remarkable in that she saw possibilities in
                        it. She was no sensualist, longing to drowse sleepily in the lap of luxury.
                        She turned about, troubled by her daring, glad of her release, wondering
                        whether she would get something to do, wondering what Drouet would do. That
                        worthy had his future fixed for him beyond a peradventure. He could not help
                        what he was going to do. He could not see clearly enough to wish to do
                        differently. He was drawn by his innate desire to act the old pursuing part.
                        He would need to delight himself with Carrie as surely as he would need to
                        eat his heavy breakfast. He might suffer the least rudimentary twinge of
                        conscience in whatever he did, and in just so far he was evil and sinning.
                        But whatever twinges of conscience he might have would be rudimentary, you
                        may be sure.</p>
                    <p>The next day he called upon Carrie, and she saw him in her chamber. He was
                        the same jolly, enlivening soul.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw,&quot; he said, &quot;what are you looking so blue
                        about? Come on out to breakfast. You want to get your other clothes
                        to-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at him with the hue of shifting thought in her large eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish I could get something to do,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll get that all right,&quot; said Drouet.
                        &quot;What&apos;s the use worrying right now? Get yourself fixed up.
                        See the city. I won&apos;t hurt you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know you won&apos;t,&quot; she remarked, half
                        truthfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Got on the new shoes, haven&apos;t you? Stick &apos;em out.
                        George, they look fine. Put on your jacket.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie obeyed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say, that fits like a T, don&apos;t it?&quot; he remarked,
                        feeling the set of it at the waist and eyeing it from a few paces with real
                        pleasure. &quot;What you need now is a new skirt. Let&apos;s go to
                        breakfast.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-092" n="86"/>
                    <p>Carrie put on her hat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are the gloves?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here,&quot; she said, taking them out of the bureau drawer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, come on,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Thus the first hour of misgiving was swept away.</p>
                    <p>It went this way on every occasion. Drouet did not leave her much alone. She
                        had time for some lone wanderings, but mostly he filled her hours with
                        sight-seeing. At Carson, Pirie&apos;s he bought her a nice skirt and
                        shirt waist. With his money she purchased the little necessaries of toilet,
                        until at last she looked quite another maiden. The mirror convinced her of a
                        few things which she had long believed. She was pretty, yes, indeed! How
                        nice her hat set, and weren&apos;t her eyes pretty. She caught her
                        little red lip with her teeth and felt her first thrill of power. Drouet was
                        so good.</p>
                    <p>They went to sec &quot;The Mikado&quot; one evening, an opera which
                        was hilariously popular at that time. Before going, they made off for the
                        Windsor dining-room, which was in Dearborn Street, a considerable distance
                        from Carrie&apos;s room. It was blowing up cold, and out of her window
                        Carrie could see the western sky, still pink with the fading light, but
                        steely blue at the top where it met the darkness. A long, thin cloud of pink
                        hung in midair, shaped like some island in a far-off sea. Somehow the
                        swaying of some dead branches of trees across the way brought back the
                        picture with which she was familiar when she looked from their front window
                        in December days at home.</p>
                    <p>She paused and wrung her little hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter?&quot; said Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know,&quot; she said, her lip
                        trembling.</p>
                    <p>He sensed something, and slipped his arm over her shoulder, patting her
                        arm.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-093" n="87"/>
                    <p>&quot;Come on,&quot; he said gently, &quot;you&apos;re all
                        right.&quot; She turned to slip on her jacket.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better wear that boa about your throat to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They walked north on Wabash to Adams Street and then west. The lights in the
                        stores were already shining out in gushes of golden hue. The arc lights were
                        sputtering overhead, and high up were the lighted windows of the tall office
                        buildings. The chill wind whipped in and out in gusty breaths. Homeward
                        bound, the six o&apos;clock throng bumped and jostled. Light overcoats
                        were turned up about the ears, hats were pulled down. Little shop-girls went
                        fluttering by in pairs and fours, chattering, laughing. It was a spectacle
                        of warm-blooded humanity.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly a pair of eyes met Carrie&apos;s in recognition. They were
                        looking out from a group of poorly dressed girls. Their clothes were faded
                        and loose-hanging, their jackets old, their general make-up shabby.</p>
                    <p>Carrie recognised the glance and the girl. She was one of those who worked at
                        the machines in the shoe factory. The latter looked, not quite sure, and
                        then turned her head and looked. Carrie felt as if some great tide had
                        rolled between them. The old dress and the old machine came back. She
                        actually started. Drouet didn&apos;t notice until Carrie bumped into a
                        pedestrian.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must be thinking,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>They dined and went to the theatre. That spectacle pleased Carrie immensely.
                        The colour and grace of it caught her eye. She had vain imaginings about
                        place and power, about far-off lands and magnificent people. When it was
                        over, the clatter of coaches and the throng of fine ladies made her
                        stare.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; said Drouet, holding her back in the showy
                        foyer where ladies and gentlemen were moving in a social crush, skirts
                        rustling, lace-covered heads noding, <pb id="VAA2423-094" n="88"/> white
                        teeth showing through parted lips. &quot;Let&apos;s
                        see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sixty-seven,&quot; the coach-caller was saying, his voice
                        lifted in a sort of euphonious cry. &quot;Sixty-seven.&quot;
                        &quot;Isn&apos;t it fine?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Great,&quot; said Drouet. He was as much affected by this show
                        of finery and gayety as she. He pressed her arm warmly. Once she looked up,
                        her even teeth glistening through her smiling lips, her eyes alight. As they
                        were moving out he whispered down to her, &quot;You look
                        lovely!&quot; They were right where the coach-caller was swinging open a
                        coach-door and ushering in two ladies.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You stick to me and we&apos;ll have a coach,&quot; laughed
                        Drouet.</p>
                    <p>Carrie scarcely heard, her head was so full of the swirl of life.</p>
                    <p>They stopped in at a restaurant for a little after-theatre lunch. Just a
                        shade of a thought of the hour entered Carrie&apos;s head, but there was
                        no household law to govern her now. If any habits ever had time to fix upon
                        her, they would have operated here. Habits are peculiar things. They will
                        drive the really non-religious mind out of bed to say prayers that are only
                        a custom and not a devotion. The victim of habit, when he has neglected the
                        thing which it was his custom to do, feels a little scratching in the brain,
                        a little irritating something which comes of being out of the rut, and
                        imagines it to be the prick of conscience, the still, small voice that is
                        urging him ever to righteousness. If the digression is unusual enough, the
                        drag of habit will be heavy enough to cause the unreasoning victim to return
                        and perform the perfunctory thing. &quot;Now, bless me,&quot; says
                        such a mind, &quot;I have done my duty,&quot; when, as a matter of
                        fact, it has merely done its old, unbreakable trick once again.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-095" n="89"/>
                    <p>Carrie had no excellent home principles fixed upon her. If she had, she would
                        have been more consciously distressed. Now the lunch went off with
                        considerable warmth. Under the influence of the varied occurrences, the
                        fine, invisible passion which was emanating from Drouet, the food, the still
                        unusual luxury, she relaxed and heard with open ears. She was again the
                        victim of the city&apos;s hypnotic influence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Drouet at last, &quot;we had better be
                        going.&quot; They had been dawdling over the dishes, and their eyes had
                        frequently met. Carrie could not help but feel the vibration of force which
                        followed, which, indeed, was his gaze. He had a way of touching her hand in
                        explanation, as if to impress a fact upon her. He touched it now as he spoke
                        of going.</p>
                    <p>They arose and went out into the street. The down-town section was now bare,
                        save for a few whistling strollers, a few <hi rend="i">owl</hi> cars, a few
                        open resorts whose windows were still bright. Out Wabash Avenue they
                        strolled, Drouet still pouring forth his volume of small information. He had
                        Carrie&apos;s arm in his, and held it closely as he explained. Once in a
                        while, after some witticism, he would look down, and his eyes would meet
                        hers. At last they came to the steps, and Carrie stood up on the first one,
                        her head now coming even with his own. He took her hand and held it
                        genially. He looked steadily at her as she glanced about, warmly musing.</p>
                    <p>At about that hour, Minnie was soundly sleeping, after a long evening of
                        troubled thought. She had her elbow in an awkward position under her side.
                        The muscles so held irritated a few nerves, and now a vague scene floated in
                        on the drowsy mind. She fancied she and Carrie were somewhere beside an old
                        coal-mine. She could see the tall runway and the heap of earth and coal cast
                        out. There was a deep pit, into which they were looking; they <pb
                            id="VAA2423-096" n="90"/> could see the curious wet stones far down
                        where the wall disappeared in vague shadows. An old basket, used for
                        descending, was hanging there, fastened by a worn rope.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s get in,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Minnie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, come on,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>She began to pull the basket over, and now, in spite of all protest, she had
                        swung over and was going down.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Carrie,&quot; she called, &quot;Carrie, come
                        back;&quot; but Carrie was far down now and the shadow had swallowed her
                        completely.</p>
                    <p>She moved her arm.</p>
                    <p>Now the mystic scenery merged queerly and the place was by waters she had
                        never seen. They were upon some board or ground or something that reached
                        far out, and at the end of this was Carrie. They looked about, and now the
                        thing was sinking, and Minnie heard the low sip of the encroaching
                        water.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on, Carrie,&quot; she called, but Carrie was reaching
                        farther out. She seemed to recede, and now it was difficult to call to
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Carrie,&quot; she called, &quot;Carrie,&quot; but her
                        own voice sounded far away, and the strange waters were blurring everything.
                        She came away suffering as though she had lost something. She was more
                        inexpressibly sad than she had ever been in life.</p>
                    <p>It was this way through many shifts of the tired brain, those curious
                        phantoms of the spirit slipping in, blurring strange scenes, one with the
                        other. The last one made her cry out, for Carrie was slipping away somewhere
                        over a rock, and her fingers had let loose and she had seen her falling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Minnie! What&apos;s the matter? Here, wake up,&quot; said
                        Hanson, disturbed, and shaking her by the shoulder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whawhat&apos;s the matter?&quot; said Minnie, drowsily.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-097" n="91"/>
                    <p>&quot;Wake up,&quot; he said, &quot;and turn over.
                        You&apos;re talking in your sleep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A week or so later Drouet strolled into Fitzgerald and Moy&apos;s, spruce
                        in dress and manner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello, Charley,&quot; said Hurstwood, looking out from his
                        office door.</p>
                    <p>Drouet strolled over and looked in upon the manager at his desk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When do you go out on the road again?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pretty soon,&quot; said Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Haven&apos;t seen much of you this trip,&quot; said
                        Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ve been busy,&quot; said Drouet.</p>
                    <p>They talked some few minutes on general topics.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say,&quot; said Drouet, as if struck by a sudden idea,
                        &quot;I want you to come out some evening.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Out where?&quot; inquired Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Out to my house, of course,&quot; said Drouet, smiling.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood looked up quizzically, the least suggestion of a smile hovering
                        about his lips. He studied the face of Drouet in his wise way, and then with
                        the demeanour of a gentleman, said: &quot;Certainly; glad
                        to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll have a nice game of euchre.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;May I bring a nice little bottle of Sec?&quot; asked
                        Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Drouet. &quot;I&apos;ll introduce
                        you.&quot;</p>

                        GREEN</head>
                    <p>Hurstwood&apos;s residence on the North Side, near Lincoln Park, was a
                        brick building of a very popular type then, a three-story affair with the
                        first floor sunk a very little below the level of the street. It had a large
                        bay window bulging out from the second floor, and was graced in front by a
                        small grassy plot, twenty-five feet wide and ten feet deep. There was also a
                        small rear yard, walled in by the fences of the neighbours and holding a
                        stable where he kept his horse and trap.</p>
                    <p>The ten rooms of the house were occupied by himself, his wife Julia, and his
                        son and daughter, George, Jr., and Jessica. There were besides these a
                        maid-servant, represented from time to time by girls of various extraction,
                        for Mrs. Hurstwood was not always easy to please.</p>
                    <p>&quot;George, I let Mary go yesterday,&quot; was not an un-frequent
                        salutation at the dinner table.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; was his only reply. He had long since wearied
                        of discussing the rancorous subject.</p>
                    <p>A lovely home atmosphere is one of the flowers of the world, than which there
                        is nothing more tender, nothing more delicate, nothing more calculated to
                        make strong and just the natures cradled and nourished within it. Those who
                        have never experienced such a beneficent influence will not understand
                        wherefore the tear springs glistening to the eyelids at some strange breath
                        in lovely <pb id="VAA2423-099" n="93"/> music. The mystic chords which bind
                        and thrill the heart of the nation, they will never know.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood&apos;s residence could scarcely be said to be infused with this
                        home spirit. It lacked that toleration and regard without which the home is
                        nothing. There was fine furniture, arranged as soothingly as the artistic
                        perception of the occupants warranted. There were soft rugs, rich,
                        upholstered chairs and divans, a grand piano, a marble carving of some
                        unknown Venus by some unknown artist, and a number of small bronzes gathered
                        from heaven knows where, but generally sold by the large furniture houses
                        along with everything else which goes to make the &quot;perfectly
                        appointed house.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the dining-room stood a sideboard laden with glistening decanters and
                        other utilities and ornaments in glass, the arrangement of which could not
                        be questioned. Here was something Hurstwood knew about. He had studied the
                        subject for years in his business. He took no little satisfaction in telling
                        each Mary, shortly after she arrived, something of what the art of the thing
                        required. He was not garrulous by any means. On the contrary, there was a
                        fine reserve in his manner toward the entire domestic economy of his life
                        which was all that is comprehended by the popular term, gentlemanly. He
                        would not argue, he would not talk freely. In his manner was something of
                        the dogmatist. What he could not correct, he would ignore. There was a
                        tendency in him to walk away from the impossible thing.</p>
                    <p>There was a time when he had been considerably enamoured of his Jessica,
                        especially when he was younger and more confined in his success. Now,
                        however, in her seventeenth year, Jessica had developed a certain amount of
                        reserve and independence which was not inviting to the richest form of
                        parental devotion. She was in the high school, and had notions of life which
                        were decidedly <pb id="VAA2423-100" n="94"/> those of a patrician. She liked
                        nice clothes and urged for them constantly. Thoughts of love and elegant
                        individual establishments were running in her head. She met girls at the
                        high school whose parents were truly rich and whose fathers had standing
                        locally as partners or owners of solid businesses. These girls gave
                        themselves the airs befitting the thriving domestic establishments from
                        whence they issued. They were the only ones of the school about whom Jessica
                        concerned herself.</p>
                    <p>Young Hurstwood, Jr., was in his twentieth year, and was already connected in
                        a promising capacity with a large real estate firm. He contributed nothing
                        for the domestic expenses of the family, but was thought to be saving his
                        money to invest in real estate. He had some ability, considerable vanity,
                        and a love of pleasure that had not, as yet, infringed upon his duties,
                        whatever they were. He came in and went out, pursuing his own plans and
                        fancies, addressing a few words to his mother occasionally, relating some
                        little incident to his father, but for the most part confining himself to
                        those generalities with which most conversation concerns itself. He was not
                        laying bare his desires for any one to see. He did not find any one in the
                        house who particularly cared to see.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hurstwood was the type of the woman who has ever endeavoured to shine
                        and has been more or less chagrined at the evidences of superior capability
                        in this direction elsewhere. Her knowledge of life extended to that little
                        conventional round of society of which she was notbut longed to bea member.
                        She was not without realisation already that this thing was impossible, so
                        far as she was concerned. For her daughter, she hoped better things. Through
                        Jessica she might rise a little. Through George, Jr.&apos;s, possible
                        success she might draw to herself the privilege of pointing proudly. Even
                        Hurstwood was doing well enough, and she was anxious that <pb
                            id="VAA2423-101" n="95"/> his small real estate adventures should
                        prosper. His property holdings, as yet, were rather small, but his income
                        was pleasing and his position with Fitzgerald and Moy was fixed. Both those
                        gentlemen were on pleasant and rather informal terms with him.</p>
                    <p>The atmosphere which such personalities would create must be apparent to all.
                        It worked out in a thousand little conversations, all of which were of the
                        same calibre.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going up to Fox Lake to-morrow,&quot; announced
                        George, Jr., at the dinner table one Friday evening.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s going on up there?&quot; queried Mrs.
                        Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Eddie Fahrway&apos;s got a new steam launch, and he wants me to
                        come up and see how it works.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much did it cost him?&quot; asked his mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, over two thousand dollars. He says it&apos;s a
                        dandy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Old Fahrway must be making money,&quot; put in Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is, I guess. Jack told me they were shipping Vega-cura to
                        Australia nowsaid they sent a whole box to Cape Town last
                        week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just think of that!&quot; said Mrs. Hurstwood, &quot;and
                        only four years ago they had that basement in Madison Street.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jack told me they were going to put up a six-story building next
                        spring in Robey Street.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just think of that!&quot; said Jessica.</p>
                    <p>On this particular occasion Hurstwood wished to leave early.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess I&apos;ll be going down town,&quot; he remarked,
                        rising.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are we going to McVicker&apos;s Monday?&quot; questioned
                        Mrs. Hurstwood, without rising.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said indifferently.</p>
                    <p>They went on dining, while he went upstairs for his hat and coat. Presently
                        the door clicked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-102" n="96"/>
                    <p>&quot;I guess papa&apos;s gone,&quot; said Jessica.</p>
                    <p>The latter&apos;s school news was of a particular stripe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re going to give a performance in the Lyceum,
                        upstairs,&quot; she reported one day, &quot;and I&apos;m going
                        to be in it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you?&quot; said her mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and I&apos;ll have to have a new dress. Some of the nicest
                        girls in the school are going to be in it. Miss Palmer is going to take the
                        part of Portia.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is she?&quot; said Mrs. Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ve got that Martha Griswold in it again. She thinks
                        she can act.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Her family doesn&apos;t amount to anything, does it?&quot;
                        said Mrs. Hurstwood sympathetically. &quot;They haven&apos;t
                        anything, have they?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; returned Jessica, &quot;they&apos;re poor as
                        church mice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She distinguished very carefully between the young boys of the school, many
                        of whom were attracted by her beauty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you think?&quot; she remarked to her mother one
                        evening; &quot;that Herbert Crane tried to make friends with
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who is he, my dear?&quot; inquired Mrs. Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no one,&quot; said Jessica, pursing her pretty lips.
                        &quot;He&apos;s just a student there. He hasn&apos;t
                        anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The other half of this picture came when young Blyford, son of Blyford, the
                        soap manufacturer, walked home with her. Mrs. Hurstwood was on the third
                        floor, sitting in a rocking-chair reading, and happened to look out at the
                        time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who was that with you, Jessica?&quot; she inquired, as Jessica
                        came upstairs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s Mr. Blyford, mamma,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it?&quot; said Mrs. Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and he wants me to stroll over into the park <pb
                            id="VAA2423-103" n="97"/> with him,&quot; explained Jessica, a
                        little flushed with running up the stairs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right, my dear,&quot; said Mrs. Hurstwood.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t be gone long&quot;</p>
                    <p>As the two went down the street, she glanced interestedly out of the window.
                        It was a most satisfactory spectacle indeed, most satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>In this atmosphere Hurstwood had moved for a number of years, not thinking
                        deeply concerning it. His was not the order of nature to trouble for
                        something better, unless the better was immediately and sharply contrasted.
                        As it was, he received and gave, irritated sometimes by the little displays
                        of selfish indifference, pleased at times by some show of finery which
                        supposedly made for dignity and social distinction. The life of the resort
                        which he managed was his life. There he spent most of his time. When he went
                        home evenings the house looked nice. With rare exceptions the meals were
                        acceptable, being the kind that an ordinary servant can arrange. In part, he
                        was interested in the talk of his son and daughter, who always looked well.
                        The vanity of Mrs. Hurstwood caused her to keep her person rather showily
                        arrayed, but to Hurstwood this was much better than plainness. There was no
                        love lost between them. There was no great feeling of dissatisfaction. Her
                        opinion on any subject was not startling. They did not talk enough together
                        to come to the argument of any one point. In the accepted and popular
                        phrase, she had her ideas and he had his. Once in a while he would meet a
                        woman whose youth, sprightliness, and humour would make his wife seem rather
                        deficient by contrast, but the temporary dissatisfaction which such an
                        encounter might arouse would be counterbalanced by his social position and a
                        certain matter of policy. He could not complicate his home life, because it
                        might affect his relations with his employers.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-104" n="98"/>
                    <p>They wanted no scandals. A man, to hold his position, must have a dignified
                        manner, a clean record, a respectable home anchorage. Therefore he was
                        circumspect in all he did, and whenever he appeared in the public ways in
                        the afternoon, or on Sunday, it was with his wife, and sometimes his
                        children. He would visit the local resorts, or those near by in Wisconsin,
                        and spend a few stiff, polished days strolling about conventional places
                        doing conventional things. He knew the need of it.</p>
                    <p>When some one of the many middle-class individuals whom he knew, who had
                        money, would get into trouble, he would shake his head. It didn&apos;t
                        do to talk about those things. If it came up for discussion among such
                        friends as with him passed for close, he would deprecate the folly of the
                        thing. &quot;It was all right to do itall men do those thingsbut why
                        wasn&apos;t he careful? A man can&apos;t be too careful.&quot;
                        He lost sympathy for the man that made a mistake and was found out.</p>
                    <p>On this account he still devoted some time to showing his wife abouttime
                        which would have been wearisome indeed if it had not been for the people he
                        would meet and the little enjoyments which did not depend upon her presence
                        or absence. He watched her with considerable curiosity at times, for she was
                        still attractive in a way and men looked at her. She was affable, vain,
                        subject to flattery, and this combination, he knew quite well, might produce
                        a tragedy in a woman of her home position. Owing to his order of mind, his
                        confidence in the sex was not great. His wife never possessed the virtues
                        which would win the confidence and admiration of a man of his nature. As
                        long as she loved him vigorously he could see how confidence could be, but
                        when that was no longer the binding chainmdash;well, something might
                        happen.</p>
                    <p>During the last year or two the expenses of the family seemed a large thing.
                        Jessica wanted fine clothes, and <pb id="VAA2423-105" n="99"/> Mrs.
                        Hurstwood, not to be outshone by her daughter, also frequently enlivened her
                        apparel. Hurstwood had said nothing in the past, but one day he
                        murmured.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jessica must have a new dress this month,&quot; said Mrs.
                        Hurstwood one morning.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was arraying himself in one of his perfection vests before the
                        glass at the time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought she just bought one,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That was just something for evening wear,&quot; returned his
                        wife complacently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It seems to me,&quot; returned Hurstwood, &quot;that
                        she&apos;s spending a good deal for dresses of late.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, she&apos;s going out more,&quot; concluded his wife,
                        but the tone of his voice impressed her as containing something she had not
                        heard there before.</p>
                    <p>He was not a man who travelled much, but when he did, he had been accustomed
                        to take her along. On one occasion recently a local aldermanic junket had
                        been arranged to visit Philadelphiaa junket that was to last ten days.
                        Hurstwood had been invited.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nobody knows us down there,&quot; said one, a gentleman whose
                        face was a slight improvement over gross ignoranee and sensuality. He always
                        wore a silk hat of most imposing proportions. &quot;We can have a good
                        time.&quot; His left eye moved with just the semblance of a wink.
                        &quot;You want to come along, George.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The next day Hurstwood announced his intention to his wife.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going away, Julia,&quot; he said, &quot;for a
                        few days.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where?&quot; she asked, looking up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To Philadelphia, on business.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him consciously, expecting something else.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll have to leave you behind this time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; she replied, but he could see that she was <pb
                            id="VAA2423-106" n="100"/> thinking that it was a curious thing. Before
                        he went she asked him a few more questions, and that irritated him. He began
                        to feel that she was a disagreeable attachment.</p>
                    <p>On this trip he enjoyed himself thoroughly, and when it was over he was sorry
                        to get back. He was not willingly a prevaricator, and hated thoroughly to
                        make explanations concerning it. The whole incident was glossed over with
                        general remarks, but Mrs. Hurstwood gave the subject considerable thought.
                        She drove out more, dressed better, and attended theatres freely to make up
                        for it.</p>
                    <p>Such an atmosphere could hardly come under the category of home life. It ran
                        along by force of habit, by force of conventional opinion. With the lapse of
                        time it must necessarily become dryer and dryermust eventually be tinder,
                        easily lighted and destroyed.</p>

                        CALLS</head>
                    <p>In the light of the world&apos;s attitude toward woman and her duties,
                        the nature of Carrie&apos;s mental state deserves consideration. Actions
                        such as hers are measured by an arbitrary scale. Society possesses a
                        conventional standard whereby it judges all things. All men should be good,
                        all women virtuous. Wherefore, villain, hast thou failed?</p>
                    <p>For all the liberal analysis of Spencer and our modern naturalistic
                        philosophers, we have but an infantile perception of morals. There is more
                        in the subject than mere conformity to a law of evolution. It is yet deeper
                        than conformity to things of earth alone. It is more involved than we, as
                        yet, perceive. Answer, first, why the heart thrills; explain wherefore some
                        plaintive note goes wandering about the world, undying; make clear the
                        rose&apos;s subtle alchemy evolving its ruddy lamp in light and rain. In
                        the essence of these facts lie the first principles of morals.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; thought Drouet, &quot;how delicious is my
                        conquest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah,&quot; thought Carrie, with mournful misgivings,
                        &quot;what is it I have lost?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Before this world-old proposition we stand, serious, interested, confused;
                        endeavouring to evolve the true theory of moralsthe true answer to what is
                        right.</p>
                    <p>In the view of a certain stratum of society, Carrie was <pb id="VAA2423-108"
                            n="102"/> comfortably establishedin the eyes of the starveling, beaten
                        by every wind and gusty sheet of rain, she was safe in a halcyon harbour.
                        Drouet had taken three rooms, furnished, in Ogden Place, facing Union Park,
                        on the West Side. That was a little, green-carpeted breathing spot, than
                        which, to-day, there is nothing more beautiful in Chicago. It afforded a
                        vista pleasant to contemplate. The best room looked out upon the lawn of the
                        park, now sear and brown, where a little lake lay sheltered. Over the bare
                        limbs of the trees, which now swayed in the wintry wind, rose the steeple of
                        the Union Park Congregational Church, and far off the towers of several
                        others.</p>
                    <p>The rooms were comfortably enough furnished. There was a good Brussels carpet
                        on the floor, rich in dull red and lemon shades, and representing large
                        jardinires filled with gorgeous, impossible flowers. There was a large
                        pier-glass mirror between the two windows. A large, soft, green,
                        plush-covered couch occupied one corner, and several rocking-chairs were set
                        about. Some pictures, several rugs, a few small pieces of bric--brac, and
                        the tale of contents is told.</p>
                    <p>In the bedroom, off the front room, was Carrie&apos;s trunk, bought by
                        Drouet, and in the wardrobe built into the wall quite an array of
                        clothingmore than she had ever possessed before, and of very becoming
                        designs. There was a third room for possible use as a kitchen, where Drouet
                        had Carrie establish a little portable gas stove for the preparation of
                        small lunches, oysters, Welsh rarebits, and the like, of which he was
                        exceedingly fond; and, lastly, a bath. The whole place was cosey, in that it
                        was lighted by gas and heated by furnace registers, possessing also a small
                        grate, set with an asbestos back, a method of cheerful warming which was
                        then first coming into use. By her industry and natural love of order, which
                        now developed, the place maintained an air pleasing in the extreme.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-109" n="103"/>
                    <p>Here, then, was Carrie, established in a pleasant fashion, free of certain
                        difficulties which most ominously confronted her, laden with many new ones
                        which were of a mental order, and altogether so turned about in all of her
                        earthly relationships that she might well have been a new and different
                        individual. She looked into her glass and saw a prettier Carrie than she had
                        seen before; she looked into her mind, a mirror prepared of her own and the
                        world&apos;s opinions, and saw a worse. Between these two images she
                        wavered, hesitating which to believe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My, but you&apos;re a little beauty,&quot; Drouet was wont
                        to exclaim to her.</p>
                    <p>She would look at him with large, pleased eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know it, don&apos;t you?&quot; he would continue.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know,&quot; she would reply, feeling
                        delight in the fact that one should think so, hesitating to believe, though
                        she really did, that she was vain enough to think so much of herself.</p>
                    <p>Her conscience, however, was not a Drouet, interested to praise. There she
                        heard a different voice, with which she argued, pleaded, excused. It was no
                        just and sapient counsellor, in its last analysis. It was only an average
                        little conscience, a thing which represented the world, her past
                        environment, habit, convention, in a confused way. With it, the voice of the
                        people was truly the voice of God.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, thou failure!&quot; said the voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot; she questioned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look at those about,&quot; came the whispered answer.
                        &quot;Look at those who are good. How would they scorn to do what you
                        have done. Look at the good girls; how will they draw away from such as you
                        when they know you have been weak. You had not tried before you
                        failed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was when Carrie was alone, looking out across the park, that she would be
                        listening to this. It would come <pb id="VAA2423-110" n="104"/>
                        infrequentlywhen something else did not interfere, when the pleasant side
                        was not too apparent, when Drouet was not there. It was somewhat clear in
                        utterance at first, but never wholly convincing. There was always an answer,
                        always the December days threatened. She was alone; she was desireful; she
                        was fearful of the whistling wind. The voice of want made answer for
                        her.</p>
                    <p>Once the bright days of summer pass by, a city takes on that sombre garb of
                        grey, wrapt in which it goes about its labours during the long winter. Its
                        endless buildings look grey, its sky and its streets assume a sombre hue;
                        the scattered, leafless trees and wind-blown dust and paper but add to the
                        general solemnity of colour. There seems to be something in the chill
                        breezes which scurry through the long, narrow thoroughfares productive of
                        rueful thoughts. Not poets alone, nor artists, nor that superior order of
                        mind which arrogates to itself all refinement, feel this, but dogs and all
                        men. These feel as much as the poet, though they have not the same power of
                        expression. The sparrow upon the wire, the cat in the doorway, the dray
                        horse tugging his weary load, feel the long, keen breaths of winter. It
                        strikes to the heart of all life, animate and inanimate. If it were not for
                        the artificial fires of merriment, the rush of profit-seeking trade, and
                        pleasure-selling amusements; if the various merchants failed to make the
                        customary display within and without their establishments; if our streets
                        were not strung with signs of gorgeous hues and thronged with hurrying
                        purchasers, we would quickly discover how firmly the chill hand of winter
                        lays upon the heart; how dispiriting are the days during which the sun
                        withholds a portion of our allowance of light and warmth. We are more
                        dependent upon these things than is often thought. We are insects produced
                        by heat, and pass without it.</p>

                    <p>In the drag of such a grey day the secret voice would reassert itself, feebly
                        and more feebly.</p>
                    <p>Such mental conflict was not always uppermost. Carrie was not by any means a
                        gloomy soul. More, she had not the mind to get firm hold upon a definite
                        truth. When she could not find her way out of the labyrinth of ill-logic
                        which thought upon the subject created, she would turn away entirely.</p>
                    <p>Drouet, all the time, was conducting himself in a model way for one of his
                        sort. He took her about a great deal, spent money upon her, and when he
                        travelled took her with him. There were times when she would be alone for
                        two or three days, while he made the shorter circuits of his business, but,
                        as a rule, she saw a great deal of him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say, Carrie,&quot; he said one morning, shortly after they had
                        so established themselves, &quot;I&apos;ve invited my friend
                        Hurstwood to come out some day and spend the evening with us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who is he?&quot; asked Carrie, doubtfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he&apos;s a nice man. He&apos;s manager of Fitzgerald
                        and Moy&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The finest resort in town. It&apos;s a way-up, swell
                        place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie puzzled a moment. She was wondering what Drouet had told him, what her
                        attitude would be.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s all right,&quot; said Drouet, feeling her
                        thought. &quot;He doesn&apos;t know anything. You&apos;re Mrs.
                        Drouet now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was something about this which struck Carrie as slightly inconsiderate.
                        She could see that Drouet did not have the keenest sensibilities.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t we get married?&quot; she inquired, thinking
                        of the voluble promises he had made.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we will,&quot; he said, &quot;just as soon as I get
                        this little deal of mine closed up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was referring to some property which he said he <pb id="VAA2423-112"
                            n="106"/> had, and which required so much attention, adjustment, and
                        what not, that somehow or other it interfered with his free moral, personal
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just as soon as I get back from my Denver trip in January
                        we&apos;ll do it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie accepted this as basis for hopeit was a sort of salve to her
                        conscience, a pleasant way out. Under the circumstances, things would be
                        righted. Her actions would be justified.</p>
                    <p>She really was not enamoured of Drouet. She was more clever than he. In a dim
                        way, she was beginning to see where he lacked. If it had not been for this,
                        if she had not been able to measure and judge him in a way, she would have
                        been worse off than she was. She would have adored him. She would have been
                        utterly wretched in her fear of not gaining his affection, of losing his
                        interest, of being swept away and left without an anchorage. As it was, she
                        wavered a little, slightly anxious, at first, to gain him completely, but
                        later feeling at ease in waiting. She was not exactly sure what she thought
                        of himwhat she wanted to do.</p>
                    <p>When Hurstwood called, she met a man who was more clever than Drouet in a
                        hundred ways. He paid that peculiar deference to women which every member of
                        the sex appreciates. He was not overawed, he was not overbold. His great
                        charm was attentiveness. Schooled in winning those birds of fine feather
                        among his own sex, the merchants and professionals who visited his resort,
                        he could use even greater tact when endeavouring to prove agreeable to some
                        one who charmed him. In a pretty woman of any refinement of feeling
                        whatsoever he found his greatest incentive. He was mild, placid, assured,
                        giving the impression that he wished to be of service onlyto do something
                        which would make the lady more pleased.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-113" n="107"/>
                    <p>Drouet had ability in this line himself when the game was worth the candle,
                        but he was too much the egotist to reach the polish which Hurstwood
                        possessed. He was too buoyant, too full of ruddy life, too assured. He
                        succeeded with many who were not quite schooled in the art of love. He
                        failed dismally where the woman was slightly experienced and possessed
                        innate refinement. In the case of Carrie he found a woman who was all of the
                        latter, but none of the former. He was lucky in the fact that opportunity
                        tumbled into his lap, as it were. A few years later, with a little more
                        experience, the slightest tide of success, and he had not been able to
                        approach Carrie at all.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ought to have a piano here, Drouet,&quot; said Hurstwood,
                        smiling at Carrie, on the evening in question, &quot;so that your wife
                        could play.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet had not thought of that.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So we ought,&quot; he observed readily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t play,&quot; ventured Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t very difficult,&quot; returned Hurstwood.
                        &quot;You could do very well in a few weeks.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was in the best form for entertaining this evening. His clothes were
                        particularly new and rich in appearance. The coat lapels stood out with that
                        medium stiffness which excellent cloth possesses. The vest was of a rich
                        Scotch plaid, set with a double row of round mother-of-pearl buttons. His
                        cravat was a shiny combination of silken threads, not loud, not
                        inconspicuous. What he wore did not strike the eye so forcibly as that which
                        Drouet had on, but Carrie could see the elegance of the material.
                        Hurstwood&apos;s shoes were of soft, black calf, polished only to a dull
                        shine. Drouet wore patent leather, but Carrie could not help feeling that
                        there was a distinction in favour of the soft leather, where all else was so
                        rich. She noticed these things almost unconsciously. <pb id="VAA2423-114"
                            n="108"/> They were things which would naturally flow from the
                        situation. She was used to Drouet&apos;s appearance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Suppose we have a little game of euchre?&quot; suggested
                        Hurstwood, after a light round of conversation. He was rather dexterous in
                        avoiding everything that would suggest that he knew anything of
                        Carrie&apos;s past. He kept away from personalities altogether, and
                        confined himself to those things which did not concern individuals at all.
                        By his manner, he put Carrie at her ease, and by his deference and
                        pleasantries he amused her. He pretended to be seriously interested in all
                        she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know how to play,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Charlie, you are neglecting a part of your duty,&quot; he
                        observed to Drouet most affably. &quot;Between us, though,&quot; he
                        went on, &quot;we can show you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>By his tact he made Drouet feel that he admired his choice. There was
                        something in his manner that showed that he was pleased to be there. Drouet
                        felt really closer to him than ever before. It gave him more respect for
                        Carrie. Her appearance came into a new light, under Hurstwood&apos;s
                        appreciation. The situation livened considerably.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, let me see,&quot; said Hurstwood, looking over
                        Carrie&apos;s shoulder very deferentially. &quot;What have
                        you?&quot; He studied for a moment. &quot;That&apos;s rather
                        good,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re lucky. Now, I&apos;ll show you how to trounce
                        your husband. You take my advice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here,&quot; said Drouet, &quot;if you two are going to
                        scheme together, I won&apos;t stand a ghost of a show.
                        Hurstwood&apos;s a regular sharp.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, it&apos;s your wife. She brings me luck. Why
                        shouldn&apos;t she win?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked gratefully at Hurstwood, and smiled at Drouet. The former took
                        the air of a mere friend. He <pb id="VAA2423-115" n="109"/> was simply there
                        to enjoy himself. Anything that Carrie did was pleasing to him, nothing
                        more.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There,&quot; he said, holding back one of his own good cards,
                        and giving Carrie a chance to take a trick. &quot;I count that clever
                        playing for a beginner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The latter laughed gleefully as she saw the hand coming her way. It was as if
                        she were invincible when Hurstwood helped her.</p>
                    <p>He did not look at her often. When he did, it was with a mild light in his
                        eye. Not a shade was there of anything save geniality and kindness. He took
                        back the shifty, clever gleam, and replaced it with one of innocence. Carrie
                        could not guess but that it was pleasure with him in the immediate thing.
                        She felt that he considered she was doing a great deal.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s unfair to let such playing go without earning
                        something,&quot; he said after a time, slipping his finger into the
                        little coin pocket of his coat. &quot;Let&apos;s play for
                        dimes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Drouet, fishing for bills.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was quicker. His fingers were full of new ten-cent pieces.
                        &quot;Here we are,&quot; he said, supplying each one with a little
                        stack.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, this is gambling,&quot; smiled Carrie.
                        &quot;It&apos;s bad.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Drouet, &quot;only fun. If you never play
                        for more than that, you will go to Heaven.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you moralise,&quot; said Hurstwood to Carrie
                        gently, &quot;until you see what becomes of the money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If your husband gets them, he&apos;ll tell you how bad it
                        is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet laughed loud.</p>
                    <p>There was such an ingratiating tone about Hurstwood&apos;s voice, the
                        insinuation was so perceptible that even Carrie got the humour of it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When do you leave?&quot; said Hurstwood to Drouet.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-116" n="110"/>
                    <p>&quot;On Wednesday,&quot; he replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s rather hard to have your husband running about like
                        that, isn&apos;t it?&quot; said Hurstwood, addressing Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s going along with me this time,&quot; said
                        Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must both go with me to the theatre before you
                        go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Drouet. &quot;Eh,
                        Carrie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d like it ever so much,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood did his best to see that Carrie won the money. He rejoiced in her
                        success, kept counting her winnings, and finally gathered and put them in
                        her extended hand. They spread a little lunch, at which he served the wine,
                        and afterwards he used fine tact in going.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now,&quot; he said, addressing first Carrie and then Drouet
                        with his eyes, &quot;you must be ready at 7.30. I&apos;ll come and
                        get you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They went with him to the door and there was his cab waiting, its red lamps
                        gleaming cheerfully in the shadow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now&quot; he observed to Drouet, with a tone of
                        good-fellowship, &quot;when you leave your wife alone, you must let me
                        show her around a little. It will break up her loneliness.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure,&quot; said Drouet, quite pleased at the attention
                        shown.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re so kind,&quot; observed Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not at all,&quot; said Hurstwood, &quot;I would want your
                        husband to do as much for me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He smiled and went lightly away. Carrie was thoroughly impressed. She had
                        never come in contact with such grace. As for Drouet, he was equally
                        pleased.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s a nice man,&quot; he remarked to Carrie, as
                        they returned to their cosey chamber. &quot;A good friend of mine,
                        too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He seems to be,&quot; said Carrie.</p>

                        O&apos;ER<lb/> ITS OWN</head>
                    <p>Carrie was an apt student of fortune&apos;s waysof fortune&apos;s
                        superficialities. Seeing a thing, she would immediately set to inquiring how
                        she would look, properly related to it. Be it known that this is not fine
                        feeling, it is not wisdom. The greatest minds are not so afflicted; and, on
                        the contrary, the lowest order of mind is not so disturbed. Fine clothes to
                        her were a vast persuasion; they spoke tenderly and Jesuitically for
                        themselves. When she came within earshot of their pleading, desire in her
                        bent a willing ear. The voice of so-called inanimate! Who shall translate
                        for us the language of the stones?</p>
                    <p>&quot;My dear,&quot; said the lace collar she secured from
                        Partridge&apos;s, &quot;I fit you beautifully; don&apos;t give
                        me up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, such little feet,&quot; said the leather of the soft new
                        shoes; &quot;how effectively I cover them. What a pity they should ever
                        want my aid.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Once these things were in her hand, on her person, she might dream of giving
                        them up; the method by which they came might intrude itself so forcibly that
                        she would ache to be rid of the thought of it, but she would not give them
                        up. &quot;Put on the old clothesthat torn pair of shoes,&quot; was
                        called to her by her conscience in vain. She could possibly have conquered
                        the fear of hunger and gone back; the thought of hard work and a narrow
                        round of suffering would, under the last pressure of conscience, <pb
                            id="VAA2423-118" n="112"/> have yielded, but spoil her appearance? be
                        old-clothed and poor-appearing? never!</p>
                    <p>Drouet heightened her opinion on this and allied subjects in such a manner as
                        to weaken her power of resisting their influence. It is so easy to do this
                        when the thing opined is in the line of what we desire. In his hearty way,
                        he insisted upon her good looks. He looked at her admiringly, and she took
                        it at its full value. Under the circumstances, she did not need to carry
                        herself as pretty women do. She picked that knowledge up fast enough for
                        herself. Drouet had a habit, characteristic of his kind, of looking after
                        stylishly dressed or pretty women on the street and remarking upon them. He
                        had just enough of the feminine love of dress to be a good judgenot of
                        intellect, but of clothes. He saw how they set their little feet, how they
                        carried their chins, with what grace and sinuosity they swung their bodies.
                        A dainty, self-conscious swaying or the hips by a woman was to him as
                        alluring as the glint of rare wine to a toper. He would turn and follow the
                        disappearing vision with his eyes. He would thrill as a child with the
                        unhindered passion that was in him. He loved the thing that women love in
                        themselves, grace. At this, their own shrine, he knelt with them, an ardent
                        devotee.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you see that woman who went by just now?&quot; he said to
                        Carrie on the first day they took a walk together. &quot;Fine stepper,
                        wasn&apos;t she?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked, and observed the grace commended.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, she is,&quot; she returned, cheerfully, a little
                        suggestion of possible defect in herself awakening in her mind. If that was
                        so fine, she must look at it more closely. Instinctively, she felt a desire
                        to imitate it. Surely she could do that too.</p>
                    <p>When one of her mind sees many things emphasized and remphasized and admired,
                        she gathers the logic <pb id="VAA2423-119" n="113"/> of it and applies
                        accordingly. Drouet was not shrewd enough to see that this was not tactful.
                        He could not see that it would be better to make her feel that she was
                        competing with herself, not others better than herself. He would not have
                        done it with an older, wiser woman, but in Carrie he saw only the novice.
                        Less clever than she, he was naturally unable to comprehend her sensibility.
                        He went on educating and wounding her, a thing rather foolish in one whose
                        admiration for his pupil and victim was apt to grow.</p>
                    <p>Carrie took the instructions affably. She saw what Drouet liked; in a vague
                        way she saw where he was weak. It lessens a woman&apos;s opinion of a
                        man when she learns that his admiration is so pointedly and generously
                        distributed. She sees but one object of supreme compliment in this world,
                        and that is herself. If a man is to succeed with many women, he must be all
                        in all to each.</p>
                    <p>In her own apartments Carrie saw things which were lessons in the same
                        school.</p>
                    <p>In the same house with her lived an official of one of the theatres, Mr.
                        Frank A. Hale, manager of the Standard, and his wife, a pleasing-looking
                        brunette of thirty-five. They were people of a sort very common in America
                        today, who live respectably from hand to mouth. Hale received a salary of
                        forty-five dollars a week. His wife, quite attractive, affected the feeling
                        of youth, and objected to that sort of home life which means the care of a
                        house and the raising of a family. Like Drouet and Carrie, they also
                        occupied three rooms on the floor above.</p>
                    <p>Not long after she arrived Mrs. Hale established social relations with her,
                        and together they went about. For a long time this was her only
                        companionship, and the gossip of the manager&apos;s wife formed the
                        medium through which she saw the world. Such trivialities, such praises of
                        wealth, such conventional expression of morals as sifted <pb
                            id="VAA2423-120" n="114"/> through this passive creature&apos;s
                        mind, fell upon Carrie and for the while confused her.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, her own feelings were a corrective influence. The constant
                        drag to something better was not to be denied. By those things which address
                        the heart was she steadily recalled. In the apartments across the hall were
                        a young girl and her mother. They were from Evansville, Indiana, the wife
                        and daughter of a railroad treasurer. The daughter was here to study music,
                        the mother to keep her company.</p>
                    <p>Carrie did not make their acquaintance, but she saw the daughter coming in
                        and going out. A few times she had seen her at the piano in the parlour, and
                        not infrequently had heard her play. This young woman was particularly
                        dressy for her station, and wore a jewelled ring or two which flashed upon
                        her white fingers as she played.</p>
                    <p>Now Carrie was affected by music. Her nervous composition responded to
                        certain strains, much as certain strings of a harp vibrate when a
                        corresponding key of a piano is struck. She was delicately moulded in
                        sentiment, and answered with vague ruminations to certain wistful chords.
                        They awoke longings for those things which she did not have. They caused her
                        to cling closer to things she possessed. One short song the young lady
                        played in a most soulful and tender mood. Carrie heard it through the open
                        door from the parlour below. It was at that hour between afternoon and night
                        when, for the idle, the wanderer, things are apt to take on a wistful
                        aspect. The mind wanders forth on far journeys and returns with sheaves of
                        withered and departed joys. Carrie sat at her window looking out. Drouet had
                        been away since ten in the morning. She had amused herself with a walk, a
                        book by Bertha M. Clay which Drouet had left there, though she did not
                        wholly enjoy the latter, and by changing her dress for the evening. Now she
                        sat looking <pb id="VAA2423-121" n="115"/> out across the park as wistful
                        and depressed as the nature which craves variety and life can be under such
                        circumstances. As she contemplated her new state, the strain from the
                        parlour below stole upward. With it her thoughts became coloured and
                        enmeshed. She reverted to the things which were best and saddest within the
                        small limit of her experience. She became for the moment a repentant.</p>
                    <p>While she was in this mood Drouet came in, bringing with him an entirely
                        different atmosphere. It was dusk and Carrie had neglected to light the
                        lamp. The fire in the grate, too, had burned low.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are you, Cad? &quot; he said, using a pet name he had
                        given her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>There was something delicate and lonely in her voice, but he could not hear
                        it. He had not the poetry in him that would seek a woman out under such
                        circumstances and console her for the tragedy of life. Instead, he struck a
                        match and lighted the gas.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;you&apos;ve been
                        crying.&quot; Her eyes were still wet with a few vague tears.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pshaw,&quot; he said. &quot;you don&apos;t want to do
                        that&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took her hand, feeling in his good-natured egotism that it was probably
                        lack of his presence which had made her lonely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on, now,&quot; he went on; &quot;its all right.
                        Let&apos;s waltz a little to that music.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He could not hate introduced a more incongruous proposition. It made clear to
                        Carrie that he could not sympathise with her. She could not have framed
                        thoughts which would have expressed his defect or made clear the difference
                        between them, but site felt it. It was his first great mistake.</p>
                    <p>What Drouet said about the girl&apos;s grace, as she tripped <pb
                            id="VAA2423-122" n="116"/> out evenings accompanied by her mother,
                        caused Carrie to perceive the nature and value of those little modish ways
                        which women adopt when they would presume to be something. She looked in the
                        mirror and pursed up her lips, accompanying it with a little toss of the
                        head, as she had seen the railroad treasurer&apos;s daughter do. She
                        caught up her skirts with an easy swing, for had not Drouet remarked that in
                        her and several others, and Carrie was naturally imitative. She began to get
                        the hang of those little things which the pretty woman who has vanity
                        in-variably adopts. In short, her knowledge of grace doubled, and with it
                        her appearance changed. She became a girl of considerable taste.</p>
                    <p>Drouet noticed this. He saw the new bow in her hair and the new way of
                        arranging her locks which she affected one morning.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You look fine that way, Cad,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do I?&quot; she replied, sweetly. It made her try for other
                        effects that selfsame day.</p>
                    <p>She used her feet less heavily, a thing that was brought about by her
                        attempting to imitate the treasurer&apos;s daughter&apos;s graceful
                        carriage. How much influence the presence of that young woman in the saute
                        house had upon her it would he difficult to say. But, because of all these
                        things, when Hurstwood called he had found a young woman who was mach more
                        than the Carrie to whom Drouet had first spoken. The primary defects of
                        dress and manner had passed. She was pretty, graceful, rich in the timidity
                        born of uncertainty, and with a something childlike in her large eyes which
                        captured the fancy of this starched and conventional poser among men. It was
                        the ancient attraction of the fresh for the stale. If there was a touch of
                        appreciation left in him for the bloom and unsophistication which is the
                        charm of youth, it rekindled now. He looked into her pretty face and felt
                        the subtle waves of <pb id="VAA2423-123" n="117"/> young life radiating
                        therefrom. In that large clear eye he could see nothing that his <hi
                            rend="i">blase</hi> nature could understand as guile. The little vanity,
                        if he could have perceived it there, would have touched him as a pleasant
                        thing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder,&quot; he said, as he rode away in his cab,
                        &quot;how Drouet came to win her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He gave her credit for feelings superior to Drouet at the first glance.</p>
                    <p>The cab plopped along between the far-receding lines of gas lamps on either
                        hand. He folded his gloved hands and saw only the lighted chamber and
                        Carrie&apos;s face. He was pondering over the delight of youthful
                        beauty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll have a bouquet for her,&quot; he thought.
                        &quot;Drouet won&apos;t mind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He never for a moment concealed the fact of her attraction for himself. He
                        troubled himself not at all about Drouet&apos;s priority. He was merely
                        floating those gossamer threads of thought which, like the
                        spider&apos;s, he hoped would lay hold somewhere. He did not know, he
                        could not guess, what the result would be.</p>
                    <p>A few weeks later Drouet, in his peregrinations, encountered one of his
                        well-dressed lady acquaintances in Chicago on his return from a short trip
                        to Omaha. He had intended to hurry out to Ogden Place and surprise Carrie,
                        but now he fell into an interesting conversation and soon modified his
                        original intention.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s go to dinner,&quot; he said, little reeking any
                        chance meeting which might trouble his way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said his companion.</p>
                    <p>They visited one of the better restaurants for a social chat. It was five in
                        the afternoon when they met; it was seven-thirty before the last bone was
                        picked.</p>
                    <p>Drouet was just finishing a little incident he was relating, and his face was
                        expanding into a smile, when <pb id="VAA2423-124" n="118"/>
                        Hurstwood&apos;s eye caught his own. The latter had come in with several
                        friends, and, seeing Drouet and souse woman, not Carrie, drew his own
                        conclusion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, the rascal,&quot; he thought, and then, with a touch of
                        righteous sympathy, &quot;that&apos;s pretty hard on the little
                        girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet jumped from one easy thought to another as he caught
                        Hurstwood&apos;s eye. He felt but very little misgiving, until he saw
                        that Hurstwood was cautiously pre-tending not to see. Then some of the
                        latter&apos;s impression forced itself upon him. He thought of Carrie
                        and their last meeting. By George, he would have to explain this to
                        Hurstwood. Such a chance half-hour with an old friend must not have anything
                        more attached to it than it really warranted.</p>
                    <p>For the first time he was troubled. Here was a moral complication of which he
                        could not possibly get the ends. Hurstwood would laugh at hint for being a
                        fickle boy. He would laugh with Hurstwood. Carrie would never hear, his
                        present companion at table would never know, and yet he could not help
                        feeling that he was getting the worst of itthere was some faint stigma
                        attached, and he was not guilty. He broke up the dinner by becoming dull,
                        and saw his companion on her car. Then he went home.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He hasn&apos;t talked to me about any of these later
                        flames,&quot; thought Hurstwood to himself. &quot;He thinks I think
                        he cares for the girl out there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He ought not to think I&apos;m knocking around, since I have
                        just introduced him out there,&quot; thought Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw you,&quot; Hurstwood said. genially, the next time Drouet
                        drifted in to his polished resort, from which he could not stay away. He
                        raised his forefinger indicatively, as parents do to children.</p>
                    <p>&quot;An old acquaintance of mine that I ran into just as I <pb
                            id="VAA2423-125" n="119"/> was coming up from the station,&quot;
                        explained Drouet. &quot;She used to be quite a beauty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Still attracts a little, eh? &quot;returned the other,
                        affecting to jest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Drouet, &quot;just couldn&apos;t
                        escape her this time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How long are you here? &quot;asked Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Only a few days.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must bring the girl down and take dinner with me,&quot; he
                        said. &quot;I&apos;m afraid you keep her cooped up out there.
                        I&apos;ll get a box for Joe Jefferson.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not me,&quot; answered the drummer. &quot;Sure
                        I&apos;ll come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This pleased Hurstwood immensely. He gave Drouet no credit for any feelings
                        toward Carrie whatever. He envied him, and now, as he looked at the
                        well-dressed, jolly salesman, whom he so much liked, the gleam of the rival
                        glowed in his eye. He began to &quot;size up&quot;Drouet from the
                        standpoints of wit and fascination. He began to look to see where he was
                        weak. There was no disputing that, whatever he might think of him as a good
                        fellow, he felt a certain amount of contempt for him as a lover. He could
                        hoodwink him all right. Why, if he world just let Carrie see one such little
                        incident as that of Thursday, it would settle the matter. He ran on in
                        thought, almost exulting, the while he laughed and chatted, and Drouet felt
                        nothing. He had no power of analysing the glance and the atmosphere of a
                        matt like Hurstwood. He stood and smiled and accepted the invitation while
                        his friend examined him with the eye of a hawk.</p>
                    <p>The object of this peculiarly involved comedy was not thinking of either. She
                        was busy adjusting her thoughts and feelings to newer conditions, and was
                        not in danger of suffering disturbing pangs from either quarter.</p>
                    <p>One evening Drouet found her dressing herself before the glass.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-126" n="120"/>
                    <p>&quot;Cad,&quot; said he, catching her, &quot;I believe
                        you&apos;re getting vain.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing of the kind,&quot; she returned, smiling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you&apos;re mighty pretty,&quot; he went on, slipping
                        his arm around her. &quot;Put on that navy-blue dress of yours and
                        I&apos;ll take you to the show.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;ve promised Mrs. Hale to go with her to the
                        Exposition to-night,&quot; she returned, apologetically. &quot;You
                        did, eh?&quot; he said, studying the situation abstractedly. &quot;I
                        wouldn&apos;t care to go to that myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know,&quot; answered Carrie, puzzling,
                        but not offering to break her promise in his favour.</p>
                    <p>Just then a knock came at their door and the maid-servant handed a letter
                        in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He says there&apos;s an answer expected,&quot; she
                        explained.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ts from Hurstwood,&quot; said Drouet, noting the
                        superscription as he tore it open.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are to come down and see Joe Jefferson with me
                        to-night,&quot; it ran in part. &quot;I&apos;ts my turn, as we
                        agreed the other day. All other bets are off.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what do you say to this?&quot; asked Drouet, innocently,
                        while Carrie&apos;s mind bubbled with favourable replies.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You had better decide, Charlie,&quot; she said, reservedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess we had better go, if you can break that engagement
                        upstairs,&quot; said Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I can,&quot; returned Carrie without thinking.</p>
                    <p>Drouet selected writing paper while Carrie went to change her dress. She
                        hardly explained to herself why this latest invitation appealed to her
                        most.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shall I wear my hair as I did yesterday?&quot; she asked, as
                        she came out with several articles of apparel pending.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure,&quot; he returned, pleasantly.</p>
                    <p>She was relieved to see that he felt nothing. She did <pb id="VAA2423-127"
                            n="121"/> not credit her willingness to go to any fascination Hurstwood
                        held for her. It seemed that the combination of Hurstwood, Drouet, and
                        herself was more agreeable than anything else that had been suggested. She
                        arrayed herself most carefully and they started off, extending excuses
                        upstairs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I say,&quot; said Hurstwood, as they came up the theatre lobby,
                        &quot;we are exceedingly charming this evening.&quot; Carrie
                        fluttered under his approving glance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, then,&quot; he said, leading the way up the foyer into the
                        theatre.</p>
                    <p>If ever there was dressiness it was here. It was the personification of the
                        old term spick and span.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you ever see Jefferson?&quot; he questioned, as he leaned
                        toward Carrie in the box.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never did,&quot; she returned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s delightful, delightful,&quot; he went on, giving
                        the commonplace rendition of approval which such men know. He sent Drouet
                        after a programme, and then discoursed to Carrie concerning Jefferson as he
                        had heard of him. The former was pleased beyond expression, and was really
                        hypnotised by the environment, the trappings of the box, the elegance of her
                        companion. Several times their eyes accidentally net, and then there poured
                        into hers such a flood of feeling as she had never before experienced. She
                        could not for the moment explain it, for in the next glance or the next move
                        of the hand there was seeming indifference, mingled only with the kindest
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>Drouet shared in the conversation, but he was almost dull in comparison.
                        Hurstwood entertained them both, and now it was driven into
                        Carrie&apos;s mind that here was the superior man. She instinctively
                        felt that he was stronger and higher, and yet withal so simple. By the end
                        of the third act she was sure that Drouet was only a kindly soul, <pb
                            id="VAA2423-128" n="122"/> but otherwise defective. He sank every moment
                        in her estimation by the strong comparison.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have had such a nice time,&quot; said Carrie, when it was all
                        over and they were coming out.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; added Drouet, who was not in the least aware
                        that a battle had been fought and his defences weakened. He was like the
                        Emperor of China, who sat glorying in himself, unaware that his fairest
                        provinces were being wrested front him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you have saved me a dreary evening,&quot; returned
                        Hurstwood. &quot;Good-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took Carrie&apos;s little hand, and a current of feeling swept from
                        one to the other.</p>
                    <p>I&apos;m so tired,&quot; said Carrie, leaning back in the car when
                        Drouet began to talk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you rest a little while I smoke,&quot; he said, rising,
                        and then he foolishly went to the forward platform of the car and left the
                        game as it stood.</p>

                        AMBASSADOR&apos;S<lb/> PLEA</head>
                    <p>Mrs. Hurstwood was not aware of any of her husband&apos;s moral
                        defections, though she might readily have suspected his tendencies, which
                        she well understood. She was a woman upon whose action under provocation you
                        could never count. Hurstwood, for one, had not the slightest idea of what
                        she would do under certain circumstances. He had never seen her thoroughly
                        aroused. In fact, she was not a woman who would fly into a passion. She had
                        too little faith in mankind not to know that they were erring. She was too
                        calculating to jeopardise any advantage she might gain in the way of
                        information by fruitless clamour. Her wrath would never wreak itself in one
                        fell blow. She would wait and brood, studying the details and adding to them
                        until her power might be commensurate with her desire for revenge. At the
                        same time, she would not delay to inflict any injury, big or little, which
                        would wound the object of her revenge and still leave him uncertain as to
                        the source of the evil. She was a cold, self-centred woman, with many a
                        thought of her own which never found expression, not even by so much as the
                        glint of an eye.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood felt some of this in her nature, though he did not actually
                        perceive it. He dwelt with her in peace and some satisfaction. He did not
                        fear her in the leastthere was no cause for it. She still took a faint pride
                        in him, which was augmented by her desire to have her <pb id="VAA2423-130"
                            n="124"/> social integrity maintained. She was secretly somewhat pleased
                        by the fact that much of her husband&apos;s property was in her name, a
                        precaution which Hurstwood had taken when his home interests were somewhat
                        more alluring than at present. His wife had not the slightest reason to feel
                        that anything would ever go amiss with their household, and yet the shadows
                        which run before gave her a thought of the good of it now and then. She was
                        in a position to become refractory with considerable advantage, and
                        Hurstwood conducted himself circumspectly because he felt that he could not
                        be sure of anything once she became dissatisfied.</p>
                    <p>It so happened that on the night when Hurstwood, Carrie, and Drouet were in
                        the box at McVickar&apos;s, George, Jr., was in the sixth row of the
                        parquet with the daughter of H. B. Carmichael, the third partner of a
                        wholesale drygoods house of that city. Hurstwood did not see his son, for he
                        sat, as was his wont, as far back as possible, leaving himself just
                        partially visible, when he bent forward, to those within the first six rows
                        in question. It was his wont to sit this way in every theatreto make his
                        personality as inconspicuous as possible where it would be no advantage to
                        him to have it otherwise.</p>
                    <p>He never moved but what, if there was any danger of his conduct being
                        misconstrued or ill-reported, he looked carefully about him and counted the
                        cost of every inch of conspicuity.</p>
                    <p>The next morning at breakfast his son said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw you, Governor, last night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Were you at McVickar&apos;s? &quot;said Hurstwood, with the
                        best grace in the world.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said young George.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who with?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Carmichael.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hurstwood directed an inquiring glance at her <pb id="VAA2423-131"
                            n="125"/> husband, but could not judge from his appearance whether it
                        was any more than a casual look into the theatre which was referred to.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How was the play?&quot; she inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very good,&quot; returned Hurstwood, &quot;only
                        it&apos;s the same old thing, &apos;Rip Van
                        Winkle.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whom did you go with?&quot; queried his wife, with assumed
                        indifference.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Charlie Drouet and his wife. They are friends of Moy&apos;s,
                        visiting here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Owing to the peculiar nature of his position, such a disclosure as this would
                        ordinarily create no difficulty. His wife took it for granted that his
                        situation called for certain social movements in which she might not be
                        included. But of late he had pleaded office duty on several occasions when
                        his wife asked for his company to any evening entertainment. He had done so
                        in regard to the very evening in question only the morning before.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you were going to be busy,&quot; she remarked, very
                        carefully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So I was,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I couldn&apos;t
                        help the interruption, but I made up for it afterward by working until
                        two.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This settled the discussion for the time being, but there was a residue of
                        opinion which was not satisfactory. There was no time at which the claims of
                        his wife could have been more unsatisfactorily pushed. For years he had been
                        steadily modifying his matrimonial devotion, and found her company dull. Now
                        that a new light shone upon the horizon, this older luminary paled in the
                        west. He was satisfied to turn his face away entirely, and any call to look
                        back was irksome.</p>
                    <p>She, on the contrary, was not at all inclined to accept anything less than a
                        complete fulfilment of the letter of their relationship, though the spirit
                        might be wanting.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-132" n="126"/>
                    <p>&quot;We are coming down town this afternoon,&quot; she remarked, a
                        few days later. &quot;I want you to come over to Kinsley&apos;s and
                        meet Mr. Phillips and his wife. They&apos;re stopping at the Tremont,
                        and we&apos;re going to show them around a little.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After the occurrence of Wednesday, he could not refuse, though the Phillips
                        were about as uninteresting as vanity and ignorance could make them. He
                        agreed, but it was with short grace. He was angry when he left the
                        house.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll put a stop to this,&quot; he thought.
                        &quot;I&apos;m not going to be bothered fooling around with visitors
                        when I have work to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Not long after this Mrs. Hurstwood came with a similar proposition, only it
                        was to a matine this time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My dear,&quot; he returned, &quot;I haven&apos;t time.
                        I&apos;m too busy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You find time to go with other people, though,&quot; she
                        replied, with considerable irritation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing of the kind,&quot; he answered. &quot;I
                        can&apos;t avoid business relations, and that&apos;s all there is to
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, never mind,&quot; she exclaimed. Her lips tightened. The
                        feeling of mutual antagonism was increased.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, his interest in Drouet&apos;s little shop-girl grew in
                        an almost evenly balanced proportion. That young lady, under the stress of
                        her situation and the tutelage of her new friend, changed effectively. She
                        had the aptitude of the struggler who seeks emancipation. The glow of a more
                        showy life was not lost upon her. She did not grow in knowledge so much as
                        she awakened in the matter of desire. Mrs. Hale&apos;s extended
                        harangues upon the subjects of wealth and position taught her to distinguish
                        between degrees of wealth.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hale loved to drive in the afternoon in the sun when it was fine, and to
                        satisfy her soul with a sight of <pb id="VAA2423-133" n="127"/> those
                        mansions and lawns which she could not afford. On the North Side had been
                        erected a number of elegant mansions along what is now known as the North
                        Shore Drive. The present lake wall of stone and granitoid was not then in
                        place, but the road had been well laid out, the intermediate spaces of lawn
                        were lovely to look upon, and the houses were thoroughly new and imposing.
                        When the winter season had passed and the first fine days of the early
                        spring appeared, Mrs. Hale secured a buggy for an afternoon and invited
                        Carrie. They rode first through Lincoln Park and on far out towards
                        Evanston, turning back at four and arriving at the north end of the Shore
                        Drive at about five o&apos;clock. At this time of year the days are
                        still comparatively short, and the shadows of the evening were beginning to
                        settle down upon the great city. Lamps were beginning to burn with that
                        mellow radiance which seems almost watery and translucent to the eye. There
                        was a softness in the air which speaks with an infinite delicacy of feeling
                        to the flesh as well as to the soul. Carrie felt that it was a lovely day.
                        She was ripened by it in spirit for many suggestions. As they drove along
                        the smooth pavement an occasional carriage passed. She saw one stop and the
                        footman dismount, opening the door for a gentleman who seemed to be
                        leisurely returning from some afternoon pleasure. Across the broad lawns,
                        now first freshening into green, she saw lamps faintly glowing upon rich
                        interiors. Now it was but a chair, now a table, now an ornate corner, which
                        met her eye, but it appealed to her as almost nothing else could. Such
                        childish fancies as she had had of fairy palaces and kingly quarters now
                        came back. She imagined that across these richly carved entrance-ways, where
                        the globed and crystalled lamps shone upon panelled doors set with stained
                        and designed panes of glass, was neither care nor unsatisfied desire. She
                        was perfectly <pb id="VAA2423-134" n="128"/> certain that here was
                        happiness. If she could but stroll up yon broad walk, cross that rich
                        entrance-way, which to her was of the beauty of a jewel, and sweep in grace
                        and luxury to possession and commandoh! how quickly would sadness flee; how,
                        in an instant, would the heartache end. She gazed and gazed, wondering,
                        delighting, longing, and all the while the siren voice of the unrestful was
                        whispering in her ear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If we could have such a home as that,&quot; said Mrs. Hale
                        sadly, &quot;how delightful it would be.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And yet they do say,&quot; said Carrie, &quot;that no one
                        is ever happy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had heard so much of the canting philosophy of the grapeless fox.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I notice,&quot; said Mrs. Hale, &quot;that they all try
                        mighty hard, though, to take their misery in a mansion.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When she came to her own rooms, Carrie saw their comparative insignificance.
                        She was not so dull but that she could perceive they were but three small
                        rooms in a moderately well-furnished boarding-house. She was not contrasting
                        it now with what she had had, but what she had so recently seen. The glow of
                        the palatial doors was still in her eye, the roll of cushioned carriages
                        still in her ears. What, after all, was Drouet? What was she? At her window,
                        she thought it over, rocking to and fro, and gazing out across the lamp-lit
                        park toward the lamp-lit houses on Warren and Ashland avenues. She was too
                        wrought up to care to go down to eat, too pensive to do aught but rock and
                        sing. Some old tunes crept to her lips, and, as she sang them, her heart
                        sank. She longed and longed and longed. It was now for the old cottage room
                        in Columbia City, now the mansion upon the Shore Drive, now the fine dress
                        of some lady, now the elegance of some scene. She was sad beyond measure,
                        and yet uncertain, wishing, fancying. Finally, it seemed as if all her <pb
                            id="VAA2423-135" n="129"/> state was one of loneliness and forsakenness,
                        and she could scarce refrain from trembling at the lip. She hummed and
                        hummed as the moments went by, sitting in the shadow by the window, and was
                        therein as happy, though she did not perceive it, as she ever would be.</p>
                    <p>While Carrie was still in this frame of mind, the house-servant brought up
                        the intelligence that Mr. Hurstwood was in the parlour asking to see Mr. and
                        Mrs. Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess he doesn&apos;t know that Charlie is out of
                        town,&quot; thought Carrie.</p>
                    <p>She had seen comparatively little of the manager during the winter, but had
                        been kept constantly in mind of him by one thing and another, principally by
                        the strong impression he had made. She was quite disturbed for the moment as
                        to her appearance, but soon satisfied herself by the aid of the mirror, and
                        went below.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was in his best form, as usual. He hadn&apos;t heard that
                        Drouet was out of town. He was but slightly affected by the intelligence,
                        and devoted himself to the more general topics which would interest Carrie.
                        It was surprisingthe ease with which he conducted a conversation. He was
                        like every man who has had the advantage of practice and knows he has
                        sympathy. He knew that Carrie listened to him pleasurably, and, without the
                        least effort, he fell into a train of observation which absorbed her fancy.
                        He drew up his chair and modulated his voice to such a degree that what he
                        said seemed wholly confidential. He confined himself almost exclusively to
                        his observation of men and pleasures. He had been here and there, he had
                        seen this and that. Somehow he made Carrie wish to see similar things, and
                        all the while kept her aware of himself. She could not shut out the
                        consciousness of his individuality and presence for a moment. He would raise
                        his eyes slowly in smiling emphasis of something, and she was fixed by <pb
                            id="VAA2423-136" n="130"/> their magnetism. He would draw out, with the
                        easiest grace, her approval. Once he touched her hand for emphasis and she
                        only smiled. He seemed to radiate an atmosphere which suffused her being. He
                        was never dull for a minute, and seemed to make her clever. At least, she
                        brightened under his influence until all her best side was exhibited. She
                        felt that she was more clever with him than with others. At least, he seemed
                        to find so much in her to applaud. There was not the slightest touch of
                        patronage. Drouet was full of it.</p>
                    <p>There had been something so personal, so subtle, in each meeting between
                        them, both when Drouet was present and when he was absent, that Carrie could
                        not speak of it without feeling a sense of difficulty. She was no talker.
                        She could never arrange her thoughts in fluent order. It was always a matter
                        of feeling with her, strong and deep. Each time there had been no sentence
                        of importance which she could relate, and as for the glances and sensations,
                        what woman would reveal them? Such things had never been between her and
                        Drouet. As a matter of fact, they could never be. She had been dominated by
                        distress and the enthusiastic forces of relief which Drouet represented at
                        an opportune moment when she yielded to him. Now she was persuaded by secret
                        current feelings which Drouet had never understood. Hurstwood&apos;s
                        glance was as effective as the spoken words of a lover, and more. They
                        called for no immediate decision, and could not be answered.</p>
                    <p>People in general attach too much importance to words. They are under the
                        illusion that talking effects great results. As a matter of fact, words are,
                        as a rule, the shallowest portion of all the argument. They but dimly
                        represent the great surging feelings and desires which lie behind. When the
                        distraction of the tongue is removed, the heart listens.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-137" n="131"/>
                    <p>In this conversation she heard, instead of his words, the voices of the
                        things which he represented. How suave was the counsel of his appearance!
                        How feelingly did his superior state speak for itself! The growing desire he
                        felt for her lay upon her spirit as a gentle hand. She did not need to
                        tremble at all, because it was invisible; she did not need to worry over
                        what other people would saywhat she herself would saybecause it had no
                        tangibility. She was being pleaded with, persuaded, led into denying old
                        rights and assuming new ones, and yet there were no words to prove it. Such
                        conversation as was indulged in held the same relationship to the actual
                        mental enactments of the twain that the low music of the orchestra does to
                        the dramatic incident which it is used to cover.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you ever seen the houses along the Lake Shore on the North
                        Side?&quot; asked Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, I was just over there this afternoonMrs. Hale and I.
                        Aren&apos;t they beautiful?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re very fine,&quot; he answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, me,&quot; said Carrie, pensively. &quot;I wish I could
                        live in such a place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re not happy,&quot; said Hurstwood, slowly, after
                        a slight pause.</p>
                    <p>He had raised his eyes solemnly and was looking into her own. He assumed that
                        he had struck a deep chord. Now was a slight chance to say a word in his own
                        behalf. He leaned over quietly and continued his steady gaze. He felt the
                        critical character of the period. She endeavoured to stir, but it was
                        useless. The whole strength of a man&apos;s nature was working. He had
                        good cause to urge him on. He looked and looked, and the longer the
                        situation lasted the more difficult it became. The little shop-girl was
                        getting into deep water. She was letting her few supports float away from
                        her.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-138" n="132"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she said at last, &quot;you mustn&apos;t look
                        at me like that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t help it,&quot; he answered.</p>
                    <p>She relaxed a little and let the situation endure, giving him strength.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are not satisfied with life, are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she answered, weakly.</p>
                    <p>He saw he was the master of the situationhe felt it. He reached over and
                        touched her hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t,&quot; she exclaimed, jumping up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t intend to,&quot; he answered, easily.</p>
                    <p>She did not run away, as she might have done. She did not terminate the
                        interview, but he drifted off into a pleasant field of thought with the
                        readiest grace. Not long after he rose to go, and she felt that he was in
                        power.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t feel bad,&quot; he said, kindly;
                        &quot;things will straighten out in the course of time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She made no answer, because she could think of nothing to say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We are good friends, aren&apos;t we?&quot; he said,
                        extending his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not a word, then, until I see you again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He retained a hold on her hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t promise,&quot; she said, doubtfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must be more generous than that,&quot; he said, in such a
                        simple way that she was touched.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s not talk about it any more,&quot; she
                        returned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; he said, brightening.</p>
                    <p>He went down the steps and into his cab. Carrie closed the door and ascended
                        into her room. She undid her broad lace collar before the mirror and
                        unfastened her pretty alligator belt which she had recently bought.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m getting terrible,&quot; she said, honestly
                        affected by a <pb id="VAA2423-139" n="133"/> feeling of trouble and shame.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t seem to do anything right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She unloosed her hair after a time, and let it hang in loose brown waves. Her
                        mind was going over the events of the evening.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she murmured at last,
                        &quot;what I can do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Hurstwood as he rode away, &quot;she likes
                        me all right; that I know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The aroused manager whistled merrily for a good four miles to his office an
                        old melody that he had not recalled for fifteen years.</p>

                    <p>It was not quite two days after the scene between Carrie and Hurstwood in the
                        Ogden Place parlour before he again put in his appearance. He had been
                        thinking almost uninterruptedly of her. Her leniency had, in a way, inflamed
                        his regard. He felt that he must succeed with her, and that speedily.</p>
                    <p>The reason for his interest, not to say fascination, was deeper than mere
                        desire. It was a flowering out of feelings which had been withering in dry
                        and almost barren soil for many years. It is probable that Carrie
                        represented a better order of woman than had ever attracted him before. He
                        had had no love affair since that which culminated in his marriage, and
                        since then time and the world had taught him how raw and erroneous was his
                        original judgment. Whenever he thought of it, he told himself that, if he
                        had it to do over again, he would never marry such a woman. At the same
                        time, his experience with women in general had lessened his respect for the
                        sex. He maintained a cynical attitude, well grounded on numerous
                        experiences. Such women as he had known were of nearly one type, selfish,
                        ignorant, flashy. The wives of his friends were not inspiring to look upon.
                        His own wife had developed a cold, commonplace nature which to him was
                        anything but pleasing. What he knew of that under-world where grovel the
                        beast-men of society (and he knew a great deal) had hardened his nature. He
                            <pb id="VAA2423-141" n="135"/> looked upon most women with suspiciona
                        single eye to the utility of beauty and dress. He followed them with a keen,
                        suggestive glance. At the same time, he was not so dull but that a good
                        woman commanded his respect. Personally, he did not attempt to analyse the
                        marvel of a saintly woman. He would take off his hat, and would silence the
                        light-tongued and the vicious in her presencemuch as the Irish keeper of a
                        Bowery hall will humble himself before a Sister of Mercy, and pay toll to
                        charity with a willing and reverent hand. But he would not think much upon
                        the question of why he did so.</p>
                    <p>A man in his situation who comes, after a long round of worthless or
                        hardening experiences, upon a young, unsophisticated, innocent soul, is apt
                        either to hold aloof, out of a sense of his own remoteness, or to draw near
                        and become fascinated and elated by his discovery. It is only by a
                        roundabout process that such men ever do draw near such a girl. They have no
                        method, no understanding of how to ingratiate themselves in youthful favour,
                        save when they find virtue in the toils. If, unfortunately, the fly has got
                        caught in the net, the spider can come forth and talk business upon its own
                        terms. So when maidenhood has wandered into the moil of the city, when it is
                        brought within the circle of the &quot;rounder&quot; and the rou,
                        even though it be at the outermost rim, they can come forth and use their
                        alluring arts.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood had gone, at Drouet&apos;s invitation, to meet a new baggage of
                        fine clothes and pretty features. He entered, expecting to indulge in an
                        evening of lightsome frolic, and then lose track of the newcomer forever.
                        Instead he found a woman whose youth and beauty attracted him. In the mild
                        light of Carrie&apos;s eye was nothing of the calculation of the
                        mistress. In the diffident manner was nothing of the art of the courtesan.
                        He saw at once that a mistake had been made, that some difficult conditions
                            <pb id="VAA2423-142" n="136"/> had pushed this troubled creature into
                        his presence, and his interest was enlisted. Here sympathy sprang to the
                        rescue, but it was not unmixed with selfishness. He wanted to win Carrie
                        because he thought her fate mingled with his was better than if it were
                        united with Drouet&apos;s. He envied the drummer his conquest as he had
                        never envied any man in all the course of his experience.</p>
                    <p>Carrie was certainly better than this man, as she was superior, mentally, to
                        Drouet. She came fresh from the air of the village, the light of the country
                        still in her eye. Here was neither guile nor rapacity. There were slight
                        inherited traits of both in her, but they were rudimentary. She was too full
                        of wonder and desire to be greedy. She still looked about her upon the great
                        maze of the city without understanding. Hurstwood felt the bloom and the
                        youth. He picked her as he would the fresh fruit of a tree. He felt as fresh
                        in her presence as one who is taken out of the flash of summer to the first
                        cool breath of spring.</p>
                    <p>Carrie, left alone since the scene in question, and having no one with whom
                        to counsel, had at first wandered from one strange mental conclusion to
                        another, until at last, tired out, she gave it up. She owed something to
                        Drouet, she thought. It did not seem more than yesterday that he had aided
                        her when she was worried and distressed. She had the kindliest feelings for
                        him in every way. She gave him credit for his good looks, his generous
                        feelings, and even, in fact, failed to recollect his egotism when he was
                        absent; but she could not feel any binding influence keeping her for him as
                        against all others. In fact, such a thought had never had any grounding,
                        even in Drouet&apos;s desires.</p>
                    <p>The truth is, that this goodly drummer carried the doom of all enduring
                        relationships in his own lightsome <pb id="VAA2423-143" n="137"/> manner and
                        unstable fancy. He went merrily on, assured that he was alluring all, that
                        affection followed tenderly in his wake, that things would endure
                        unchangingly for his pleasure. When he missed some old face, or found some
                        door finally shut to him, it did not grieve him deeply. He was too young,
                        too successful. He would remain thus young in spirit until he was dead.</p>
                    <p>As for Hurstwood, he was alive with thoughts and feelings concerning Carrie.
                        He had no definite plans regarding her, but he was determined to make her
                        confess an affection for him. He thought he saw in her drooping eye, her
                        unstable glance, her wavering manner, the symptoms of a budding passion. He
                        wanted to stand near her and make her lay her hand in hishe wanted to find
                        out what her next step would bewhat the next sign of feeling for him would
                        be. Such anxiety and enthusiasm had not affected him for years. He was a
                        youth again in feelinga cavalier in action.</p>
                    <p>In his position opportunity for taking his evenings out was excellent. He was
                        a most faithful worker in general, and a man who commanded the confidence of
                        his employers in so far as the distribution of his time was concerned. He
                        could take such hours off as he chose, for it was well known that he
                        fulfilled his managerial duties successfully, whatever time he might take.
                        His grace, tact, and ornate appearance gave the place an air which was most
                        essential, while at the same time his long experience made him a most
                        excellent judge of its stock necessities. Bartenders and assistants might
                        come and go, singly or in groups, but, so long as he was present, the host
                        of old-time customers would barely notice the change. He gave the place the
                        atmosphere to which they were used. Consequently, he arranged his hours very
                        much to suit himself, taking now an afternoon, now an evening, but
                        invariably returning between eleven and <pb id="VAA2423-144" n="138"/>
                        twelve to witness the last hour or two of the day&apos;s business and
                        look after the closing details.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You see that things are safe and all the employees are out when you
                        go home, George,&quot; Moy had once remarked to him, and he never once,
                        in all the period of his long service, neglected to do this. Neither of the
                        owners had for years been in the resort after five in the afternoon, and yet
                        their manager as faithfully fulfilled this request as if they had been there
                        regularly to observe.</p>
                    <p>On this Friday afternoon, scarcely two days after his previous visit, he made
                        up his mind to see Carrie. He could not stay away longer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Evans,&quot; he said, addressing the head barkeeper,
                        &quot;if any one calls, I will be back between four and
                        five.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He hurried to Madison Street and boarded a horse-car, which carried him to
                        Ogden Place in half an hour.</p>
                    <p>Carrie had thought of going for a walk, and had put on a light grey woollen
                        dress with a jaunty double-breasted jacket. She had out her hat and gloves,
                        and was fastening a white lace tie about her throat when the housemaid
                        brought up the information that Mr. Hurstwood wished to see her.</p>
                    <p>She started slightly at the announcement, but told the girl to say that she
                        would come down in a moment, and proceeded to hasten her dressing.</p>
                    <p>Carrie could not have told herself at this moment whether she was glad or
                        sorry that the impressive manager was awaiting her presence. She was
                        slightly flurried and tingling in the cheeks, but it was more nervousness
                        than either fear or favour. She did not try to conjecture what the drift of
                        the conversation would be. She only felt that she must be careful, and that
                        Hurstwood had an indefinable fascination for her. Then she gave her tie its
                        last touch with her fingers and went below.</p>
                    <p>The deep-feeling manager was himself a little strained <pb id="VAA2423-145"
                            n="139"/> in the nerves by the thorough consciousness of his mission. He
                        felt that he must make a strong play on this occasion, but now that the hour
                        was come, and he heard Carrie&apos;s feet upon the stair, his nerve
                        failed him. He sank a little in determination, for he was not so sure, after
                        all, what her opinion might be.</p>
                    <p>When she entered the room, however, her appearance gave him courage. She
                        looked simple and charming enough to strengthen the daring of any lover. Her
                        apparent nervousness dispelled his own.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How are you?&quot; he said, easily. &quot;I could not
                        resist the temptation to come out this afternoon, it was so
                        pleasant.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Carrie, halting before him, &quot;I was
                        just preparing to go for a walk myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, were you?&quot; he said. &quot;Supposing, then, you get
                        your hat and we both go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>They crossed the park and went west along Washington Boulevard, beautiful
                        with its broad macadamised road, and large frame houses set back from the
                        sidewalks. It was a street where many of the more prosperous residents of
                        the West Side lived, and Hurstwood could not help feeling nervous over the
                        publicity of it. They had gone but a few blocks when a livery stable sign in
                        one of the side streets solved the difficulty for him. He would take her to
                        drive along the new Boulevard.</p>
                    <p>The Boulevard at that time was little more than a country road. The part he
                        intended showing her was much farther out on this same West Side, where
                        there was scarcely a house. It connected Douglas Park with Washington or
                        South Park, and was nothing more than a neatly <hi rend="i">made</hi> road,
                        running due south for some five miles over an open, grassy prairie, and then
                        due east over the same kind of prairie for the same distance. There was not
                        a house to be encountered anywhere along the larger <pb id="VAA2423-146"
                            n="140"/> part of the route, and any conversation would be pleasantly
                        free of interruption.</p>
                    <p>At the stable he picked a gentle horse, and they were soon out of range of
                        either public observation or hearing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can you drive?&quot; he said, after a time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never tried,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>He put the reins in her hand, and folded his arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You see there&apos;s nothing to it much,&quot; he said,
                        smilingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not when you have a gentle horse,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can handle a horse as well as any one, after a little
                        practice,&quot; he added, encouragingly.</p>
                    <p>He had been looking for some time for a break in the conversation when he
                        could give it a serious turn. Once or twice he had held his peace, hoping
                        that in silence her thoughts would take the colour of his own, but she had
                        lightly continued the subject. Presently, however, his silence controlled
                        the situation. The drift of his thoughts began to tell. He gazed fixedly at
                        nothing in particular, as if he were thinking of something which concerned
                        her not at all. His thoughts, however, spoke for themselves. She was very
                        much aware that a climax was pending.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you know,&quot; he said, &quot;I have spent the happiest
                        evenings in years since I have known you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you?&quot; she said, with assumed airiness, but still
                        excited by the conviction which the tone of his voice carried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was going to tell you the other evening,&quot; he added,
                        &quot;but somehow the opportunity slipped away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie was listening without attempting to reply. She could think of nothing
                        worth while to say. Despite all the ideas concerning right which had
                        troubled her vaguely since she had last seen him, she was now influenced
                        again strongly in his favour.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I came out here to-day,&quot; he went on, solemnly,
                        &quot;to <pb id="VAA2423-147" n="141"/> tell you just how I feelto see
                        if you wouldn&apos;t listen to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was something of a romanticist after his kind. He was capable of
                        strong feelingsoften poetic onesand under a stress of desire, such as the
                        present, he waxed eloquent. That is, his feelings and his voice were
                        coloured with that seeming repression and pathos which is the essence of
                        eloquence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know,&quot; he said, putting his hand on her arm, and
                        keeping a strange silence while he formulated words, &quot;that I love
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie did not stir at the words. She was bound up completely in the
                        man&apos;s atmosphere. He would have church-like silence in order to
                        express his feelings, and she kept it. She did not move her eyes from the
                        flat, open scene before her. Hurstwood waited for a few moments, and then
                        repeated the words.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must not say that,&quot; she said, weakly.</p>
                    <p>Her words were not convincing at all. They were the result of a feeble
                        thought that something ought to be said. He paid no attention to them
                        whatever.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Carrie,&quot; he said, using her first name with sympathetic
                        familiarity, &quot;I want you to love me. You don&apos;t know how
                        much I need some one to waste a little affection on me. I am practically
                        alone. There is nothing in my life that is pleasant or delightful.
                        It&apos;s all work and worry with people who are nothing to
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As he said this, Hurstwood really imagined that his state was pitiful. He had
                        the ability to get off at a distance and view himself objectivelyof seeing
                        what he wanted to see in the things which made up his existence. Now, as he
                        spoke, his voice trembled with that peculiar vibration which is the result
                        of tensity. It went ringing home to his companion&apos;s heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, I should think,&quot; she said, turning upon him <pb
                            id="VAA2423-148" n="142"/> large eyes which were full of sympathy and
                        feeling, &quot;that you would be very happy. You know so much of the
                        world.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is it,&quot; he said, his voice dropping to a soft minor,
                        &quot;I know too much of the world.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was an important thing to her to hear one so well-positioned and powerful
                        speaking in this manner. She could not help feeling the strangeness of her
                        situation. How was it that, in so little a while, the narrow life of the
                        country had fallen from her as a garment, and the city, with all its
                        mystery, taken its place? Here was this greatest mystery, the man of money
                        and affairs sitting beside her, appealing to her. Behold, he had ease and
                        comfort, his strength was great, his position high, his clothing rich, and
                        yet he was appealing to her. She could formulate no thought which would be
                        just and right. She troubled herself no more upon the matter. She only
                        basked in the warmth of his feeling, which was as a grateful blaze to one
                        who is cold. Hurstwood glowed with his own intensity, and the heat of his
                        passion was already melting the wax of his companion&apos;s
                        scruples.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think,&quot; he said, &quot;I am happy; that I ought
                        not to complain? If you were to meet all day with people who care absolutely
                        nothing about you, if you went day after day to a place where there was
                        nothing but show and indifference, if there was not one person in all those
                        you knew to whom you could appeal for sympathy or talk to with pleasure,
                        perhaps you would be unhappy too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was striking a chord now which found sympathetic response in her own
                        situation. She knew what it was to meet with people who were indifferent, to
                        walk alone amid so many who cared absolutely nothing about you. Had not she?
                        Was not she at this very moment quite alone? <pb id="VAA2423-149" n="143"/>
                        Who was there among all whom she knew to whom she could appeal for sympathy?
                        Not one. She was left to herself to brood and wonder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I could be content,&quot; went on Hurstwood, &quot;if I had
                        you to love me. If I had you to go to; you for a companion. As it is, I
                        simply move about from place to place without any satisfaction. Time hangs
                        heavily on my hands. Before you came I did nothing but idle and drift into
                        anything that offered itself. Since you camewell, I&apos;ve had you to
                        think about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old illusion that here was some one who needed her aid began to grow in
                        Carrie&apos;s mind. She truly pitied this sad, lonely figure. To think
                        that all his fine state should be so barren for want of her; that he needed
                        to make such an appeal when she herself was lonely and without anchor.
                        Surely, this was too bad.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not very bad,&quot; he said, apologetically, as if he owed
                        it to her to explain on this score. &quot;You think, probably, that I
                        roam around, and get into all sorts of evil? I have been rather reckless,
                        but I could easily come out of that. I need you to draw me back, if my life
                        ever amounts to anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at him with the tenderness which virtue ever feels in its hope
                        of reclaiming vice. How could such a man need reclaiming? His errors, what
                        were they, that she could correct? Small they must be, where all was so
                        fine. At worst, they were gilded affairs, and with what leniency are gilded
                        errors viewed.</p>
                    <p>He put himself in such a lonely light that she was deeply moved.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it that way?&quot; she mused.</p>
                    <p>He slipped his arm about her waist, and she could not find the heart to draw
                        away. With his free hand he seized upon her fingers. A breath of soft spring
                        wind went bounding over the road, rolling some brown twigs <pb
                            id="VAA2423-150" n="144"/> of the previous autumn before it. The horse
                        paced leisurely on, unguided.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell me,&quot; he said, softly, &quot;that you love
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her eyes fell consciously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Own to it, dear,&quot; he said, feelingly; &quot;you do,
                        don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She made no answer, but he felt his victory.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell me,&quot; he said, richly, drawing her so close that their
                        lips were near together. He pressed her hand warmly, and then released it to
                        touch her cheek.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You do?&quot; he said, pressing his lips to her own.</p>
                    <p>For answer, her lips replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now,&quot; he said, joyously, his fine eyes ablaze,
                        &quot;you&apos;re my own girl, aren&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>By way of further conclusion, her head lay softly upon his shoulder.</p>

                    <p>Carrie in her rooms that evening was in a fine glow, physically and mentally.
                        She was deeply rejoicing in her affection for Hurstwood and his love, and
                        looked forward with fine fancy to their next meeting Sunday night. They had
                        agreed, without any feeling of enforced secrecy, that she should come down
                        town and meet him, though, after all, the need of it was the cause.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hale, from her upper window, saw her come in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Um,&quot; she thought to herself, &quot;she goes riding
                        with another man when her husband is out of the city. He had better keep an
                        eye on her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The truth is that Mrs. Hale was not the only one who had a thought on this
                        score. The house-maid who had welcomed Hurstwood had her opinion also. She
                        had no particular regard for Carrie, whom she took to be cold and
                        disagreeable. At the same time, she had a fancy for the merry and
                        easy-mannered Drouet, who threw her a pleasant remark now and then, and in
                        other ways extended her the evidence of that regard which he had for all
                        members of the sex. Hurstwood was more reserved and critical in his manner.
                        He did not appeal to this bocliced functionary in the same pleasant way. She
                        wondered that he came so frequently, that Mrs. Drouet should go out with him
                        this afternoon when Mr. Drouet was absent. She gave vent to her opinions in
                        the kitchen where the cook was. As a result, a hum of gossip was set going
                        which moved <pb id="VAA2423-152" n="146"/> about the house in that secret
                        manner common to gossip.</p>
                    <p>Carrie, now that she had yielded sufficiently to Hurstwood to confess her
                        affection, no longer troubled about her attitude towards him. Temporarily
                        she gave little thought to Drouet, thinking only of the dignity and grace of
                        her lover and of his consuming affection for her. On the first evening, she
                        did little but go over the details of the afternoon. It was the first tune
                        her sympathies had ever been thoroughly aroused, and they threw a new light
                        on her character. She had some potter of initiative, latent before, which
                        now began to exert itself. She looked more practically upon her state and
                        began to see glimmerings of a way out. Hurstwood seemed a drag in the
                        direction of honour. Her feelings were exceedingly creditable, in that they
                        constructed out of these recent developments something which conquered
                        freedom from dishonour. She had no idea what Hurstwood&apos;s nest word
                        would be. She only tool: his affection to be a fine thing, and appended
                        better, more generous results accordingly.</p>
                    <p>As yet, Hurstwood had only a thought of pleasure without responsibility. He
                        did not feel that he was doing anything to complicate his life. His position
                        was secure, his home-life. if not satisfactory, was at least undisturbed,
                        his personal liberty rather untrammelled. Carrie&apos;s love represented
                        only so much added pleasure. He would enjoy this new gift over and above his
                        ordinary allowance of pleasure. He would be happy with her and his own
                        affairs would go on as they had, undisturbed.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday evening Carrie dined with him at a place he had selected in East
                        Adams Street, and thereafter they took a cab to what was then a pleasant
                        evening resort out on Cottage Grove Avenue near 39th Street. In the process
                        of his declaration he soon realised that Carrie took his love upon a higher
                        basis than he had anticipated. She <pb id="VAA2423-153" n="147"/> kept him
                        at a distance in a rather earnest way, and submitted only to those tender
                        tokens of affection which better become the inexperienced lover. Hurstwood
                        saw that she was not to be possessed for the asking, and deferred pressing
                        his suit too warmly.</p>
                    <p>Since he feigned to believe in her married state he found that he had to
                        carry out the part. His triumph, he saw, was still at a little distance. How
                        far he could not guess.</p>
                    <p>They were returning to Ogden Place in the cab, when he asked:</p>
                    <p>&quot;When will I see you again?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she answered, wondering
                        herself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not come down to The Fair,&quot; he suggested,
                        &quot;next Tuesday?</p>
                    <p>She shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so soon,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll tell you what I&apos;ll do,&quot; he added.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll write you, care of this West Side Post-office. Could
                        you call next Tuesday?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie assented.</p>
                    <p>The cab stopped one door out of the way according to his call.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-night,&quot; he whispered, as the cab rolled away.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately for the smooth progression of this affair, Drouet returned.
                        Hurstwood was sitting in his imposing little office the next afternoon when
                        he saw Drouet enter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, hello, Charles,&quot; he called affably; &quot;back
                        again?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; smiled Drouet, approaching and looking in at the
                        door.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood arose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, looking the drummer over, &quot;rosy
                        as ever, eh?&quot;</p>
                    <p>They began talking of the people they knew and things that had happened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Been home yet?&quot; finally asked Hurstwood.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-154" n="148"/>
                    <p>&quot;No, I am going, though,&quot; said Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I remembered the little girl out there,&quot; said Hurstwood,
                        &quot;and called once. Thought you wouldn&apos;t want her left quite
                        alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Right you are,&quot; agreed Drouet. &quot;How is
                        she?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Hurstwood. &quot;Rather anxious about
                        you, though. You&apos;d better go out now and cheer her
                        up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will,&quot; said Drouet, smilingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Like to have you both come down and go to the show with me
                        Wednesday,&quot; concluded Hurstwood at parting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thanks, old man,&quot; said his friend, &quot;I&apos;ll
                        see what the girl says and let you know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They separated in the most cordial manner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s a nice fellow,&quot; Drouet thought to himself
                        as he turned the corner towards Madison.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Drouet is a good fellow,&quot; Hurstwood thought to himself as
                        he went back into his office, &quot;but he&apos;s no man for
                        Carrie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The thought of the latter turned his mind into a most pleasant vein, and he
                        wondered how he would get ahead of the drummer.</p>
                    <p>When Drouet entered Carrie&apos;s presence, he caught her in his arms as
                        usual, but she responded to his kiss with a tremour of opposition.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I had a great
                        trip.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you? How did you come out with that La Crosse man you were
                        telling me about?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, fine; sold him a complete line. There was another fellow there,
                        representing Burnstein, a regular hook-nosed sheeny, but he wasn&apos;t
                        in it. I made him look like nothing at all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As he undid his collar and unfastened his studs, preparatory to washing his
                        face and changing his clothes, he <pb id="VAA2423-155" n="149"/> dilated
                        upon his trip. Carrie could not help listening with amusement to his
                        animated descriptions.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I tell you,&quot; he said, &quot;I surprised the people at
                        the office. I&apos;ve sold more goods this last quarter than any other
                        man of our house on the road. I sold three thousand dollars&apos; worth
                        in La Crosse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He plunged his face in a basin of water, and puffed and blew as he rubbed his
                        neck and ears with his hands, while Carrie gazed upon him with mingled
                        thoughts of recollection and present judgment. He was still wiping his face,
                        when he continued:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going to strike for a raise in June. They can afford
                        to pay it, as much business as I turn in. I&apos;ll get it too,
                        don&apos;t you forget&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope you do,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And then if that little real estate deal I&apos;ve got on goes
                        through, we&apos;ll get married,&quot; he said with a great show of
                        earnestness, the while he took his place before the mirror and began
                        brushing his hair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t believe you ever intend to marry me,
                        Charlie,&quot; Carrie said ruefully. The recent protestations of
                        Hurstwood had given her courage to say this.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes I docourse I dowhat put that into your head?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had stopped his trifling before the mirror now and crossed over to her.
                        For the first time Carrie felt as if she must move away from him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you&apos;ve been saying that so long,&quot; she said,
                        looking with her pretty face upturned into his.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, and I mean it too, but it takes money to live as I want to.
                        Now, when I get this increase, I can come pretty near fixing things all
                        right, and I&apos;ll do it. Now, don&apos;t you worry,
                        girlie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He patted her reassuringly upon the shoulder, but Carrie felt how really
                        futile had been her hopes. She could <pb id="VAA2423-156" n="150"/> clearly
                        see that this easy-going soul intended no move in her behalf. He was simply
                        letting things drift because he preferred the free round of his present
                        state to any legal trammellings.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, Hurstwood appeared strong and sincere. He had no easy manner of
                        putting her off. He sympathised with her and showed her what her true value
                        was. He needed her, while Drouet did not care.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; she said remorsefully, her tone reflecting some
                        of her own success and more of her helplessness, &quot;you never
                        will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you wait a little while and see,&quot; he concluded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll marry you all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at him and felt justified. She was looking for something which
                        would calm her conscience, and here it was, a light, airy disregard of her
                        claims upon his justice. He had faithfully promised to marry her, and this
                        was the way he fulfilled his promise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say,&quot; he said, after he had, as he thought, pleasantly
                        disposed of the marriage question, &quot;I saw Hurstwood to-day, and he
                        wants us to go to the theatre with him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie started at the name, but recovered quickly enough to avoid notice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When?&quot; she asked, with assumed indifference.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wednesday. We&apos;ll go, won&apos;t we?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you think so.&quot; she answered, her manner being so
                        enforcedly reserved as to almost excite suspicion. Drouet noticed something,
                        but he thought it was due to her feelings concerning their talk about
                        marriage.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He called once, he said.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Carrie, &quot;he was out here Sunday
                        evening.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was he?&quot; said Drouet. &quot;I thought from what he
                        said that he had called a week or so ago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So he did,&quot; answered Carrie, who was wholly unaware of
                        what conversation her lovers might have held. She <pb id="VAA2423-157"
                            n="151"/> was all at sea mentally, and fearful of some entanglement
                        which might ensue from what she would answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, then he called twice?&quot; said Drouet, the first shade of
                        misunderstanding showing in his face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Carrie innocently, feeling now that Hurstwood
                        must have mentioned but one call.</p>
                    <p>Drouet imagined that he must have misunderstood his friend. He did not attach
                        particular importance to the information, after all.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did he have to say?&quot; he queried, with slightly
                        increased curiosity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He said he came because he thought I might be lonely. You
                        hadn&apos;t been in there so long he wondered what had become of
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;George is a fine fellow,&quot; said Drouet, rather gratified by
                        his conception of the manager&apos;s interest. &quot;Come on and
                        we&apos;ll go out to dinner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When Hurstwood saw that Drouet was back he wrote at once to Carrie,
                        saying:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I told him I called on you, dearest, when he was away. I did not
                        say from often, but he probably thought once. Let me know of anything you
                        may have said. Answer by special messenger when you get this, and, darling,
                        I must see you. Let me know if you can&apos;t meet me at Jackson and
                        Throop Streets Wednesday afternoon at two o&apos;clock. I want to speak
                        with you before we meet at the theatre.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie received this Tuesday morning when she called at the West Side branch
                        of the post-office, and answered at once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I said you called twice,&quot; she wrote. &quot;He
                        didn&apos;t seem to mind. I will try and be at Throop Street if nothing
                        interferes. I seem to be getting very bad. It&apos;s wrong to act as I
                        do, I know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood, when he met her as agreed, reassured her on this score.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-158" n="152"/>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t worry, sweetheart,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;Just as soon as he goes on the road again we will arrange
                        something. We&apos;ll fix it so that you won&apos;t have to deceive
                        any one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie imagined that he would marry her at once, though he had not directly
                        said so, and her spirits rose. She proposed to make the best of the
                        situation until Drouet left again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t show any more interest in me than you ever
                        have,&quot; Hurstwood counselled concerning the evening at the
                        theatre.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t look at me steadily then,&quot; she
                        answered, mindful of the power of his eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t,&quot; he said, squeezing her hand at parting
                        and giving the glance she had just cautioned against.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There,&quot; she said playfully, pointing a finger at him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The show hasn&apos;t begun yet,&quot; he returned.</p>
                    <p>He watched her walk from him with tender solicitation. Such youth and
                        prettiness reacted upon him more subtly than wine.</p>
                    <p>At the theatre things passed as they had in Hurstwood&apos;s favour. If
                        he had been pleasing to Carrie before, how much more so was he now. His
                        grace was more permeating because it found a readier medium. Carrie watched
                        his every movement with pleasure. She almost forgot poor Drouet, who babbled
                        on as if he were the host.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was too clever to give the slightest indication of a change. He
                        paid, if anything, more attention to his old friend than usual, and yet in
                        no way held him up to that subtle ridicule which a lover in favour may so
                        secretly practise before the mistress of his heart. If anything, he felt the
                        injustice of the game as it stood, and was not cheap enough to add to it the
                        slightest mental taunt.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-159" n="153"/>
                    <p>Only the play produced an ironical situation, and this was due to Drouet
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>The scene was one in &quot;The Covenant,&quot; in which the wife
                        listened to the seductive voice of a lover in the absence of her
                        husband.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Served him right,&quot; said Drouet afterward, even in view of
                        her keen expiation of her error. &quot;I haven&apos;t any pity for a
                        man who would be such a clump as that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you never can tell,&quot; returned Hurstwood gently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He probably thought he was right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, a man ought to be more attentive than that to his wife if he
                        wants to keep her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They had come out of the lobby and made their way through the showy crush
                        about the entrance way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say, mister,&quot; said a voice at Hurstwood&apos;s side,
                        &quot;would you mind giving me the price of a bed?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was interestedly remarking to Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Honest to God, mister, I&apos;m without a place to
                        sleep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The plea was that of a gaunt-faced man of about thirty, who looked the
                        picture of privation and wretchedness. Drouet was the first to see. He
                        handed over a dime with an upwelling feeling of pity in his heart. Hurstwood
                        scarcely noticed the incident. Carrie quickly forgot.</p>

                    <p>The complete ignoring by Hurstwood of his own home came with the growth of
                        his affection for Carrie. His actions, in all that related to his family,
                        were of the most perfunctory kind. He sat at breakfast with his wife and
                        children, absorbed in his own fancies, which reached far without the realm
                        of their interests. He read his paper, which was heightened in interest by
                        the shallowness of the themes discussed by his son and daughter. Between
                        himself and his wife ran a river of indifference.</p>
                    <p>Now that Carrie had come, he was in a fair may to be blissful again. There
                        was delight in going down town evenings. When he walked forth in the short
                        days, the street lamps had a merry twinkle. He began to experience the
                        almost forgotten feeling which hastens the lover&apos;s feet. When he
                        looked at his fine clothes, he saw them with her eyesand her eyes were
                        young.</p>
                    <p>When in the flush of such feelings he heard his wife&apos;s voice, when
                        the insistent demands of matrimony recalled him from dreams to a stale
                        practice, how it grated. He then knew that this was a chain which bound his
                        feet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;George,&quot; said Mrs. Hurstwood, in that tone of voice which
                        had long since come to be associated in his mind with demands, &quot;we
                        want you to get us a season ticket to the races.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you want to go to all of them?&quot; he said with a rising
                        inflection.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-161" n="155"/>
                    <p>The races in question were soon to open at Washington Park, on the South
                        Side, and were considered quite society affairs among those who did not
                        affect religious rectitude and conservatism. Mrs. Hurstwood had never asked
                        for a whole season ticket before, but this year certain considerations
                        decided her to get a box. For one thing, one of her neighbours, a certain
                        Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, who were possessors of money, made out of the coal
                        business, had done so. In the next place, her favourite physician, Dr.
                        Beale, a gentleman inclined to horses and betting, had talked with her
                        concerning his intention to enter a two-year-old in the Derby. In the third
                        place, she wished to exhibit Jessica, who was gaining in maturity and
                        beauty, and whom she hoped to marry to a man of means. Her own desire to be
                        about in such things and parade among her acquaintances and the common
                        throng was as much an incentive as anything.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood thought over the proposition a few moments without answering. They
                        were in the sitting-room on the second floor, waiting for supper. It was the
                        evening of his engagement with Carrie and Drouet to see &quot;The
                        Covenant,&quot; which had brought him home to make some alterations in
                        his dress.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re sure separate tickets wouldn&apos;t do as
                        well?&quot; he asked, hesitating to say anything more rugged.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she replied impatiently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, taking offence at her manner,
                        &quot;you needn&apos;t get mad about it. I&apos;m just asking
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not mad,&quot; she snapped. &quot;I&apos;m
                        merely asking you for a season ticket.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I&apos;m telling you,&quot; he returned, fixing a
                        clear, steady eye on her, &quot;that it&apos;s no easy thing to get.
                        I&apos;m not sure whether the manager will give it to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had been thinking all the time of his &quot;pull&quot; with the
                        race-track magnates.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-162" n="156"/>
                    <p>&quot;We can buy it then,&quot; she exclaimed sharply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You talk easy,&quot; he said. &quot;A season family ticket
                        costs one hundred and fifty dollars.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not argue with you,&quot; she replied with
                        determination. &quot;I want the ticket and that&apos;s all there is
                        to it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had risen, and now walked angrily out of the room.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you get it then,&quot; he said grimly, though in a
                        modified tone of voice.</p>
                    <p>As usual, the table was one short that evening.</p>
                    <p>The next morning he had cooled down considerably, and later the ticket was
                        duly secured, though it did not heal matters. He did not mind giving his
                        family a fair share of all that he earned, but he did not like to be forced
                        to provide against his will.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you know, mother,&quot; said Jessica another day,
                        &quot;the Spencers are getting ready to go away?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. Where, I wonder?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Europe,&quot; said Jessica. &quot;I met Georgine yesterday
                        and she told me. She just put on more airs about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did she say when?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Monday, I think. They&apos;ll get a notice in the papers
                        againthey always do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind,&quot; said Mrs. Hurstwood consolingly,
                        &quot;we&apos;ll go one of these days.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood moved his eyes over the paper slowly, but said nothing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;We sail for Liverpool from New York,&apos;&quot;
                        Jessica exclaimed, mocking her acquaintance. &quot;&apos;Expect to
                        spend most of the &quot;summah&quot; in France,&apos;vain thing.
                        As if it was anything to go to Europe.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It must be if you envy her so much,&quot; put in Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>It grated upon him to see the feeling his daughter displayed.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-163" n="157"/>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry over them, my dear,&quot; said Mrs.
                        Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did George get off?&quot; asked Jessica of her mother another
                        day, thus revealing something that Hurstwood had heard nothing about.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where has he gone?&quot; he asked, looking up. He had never
                        before been kept in ignorance concerning departures.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He was going to Wheaton,&quot; said Jessica, not noticing the
                        slight put upon her father.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s out there?&quot; he asked, secretly irritated
                        and chagrined to think that he should be made to pump for information in
                        this manner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A tennis match,&quot; said Jessica.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He didn&apos;t say anything to me,&quot; Hurstwood
                        concluded, finding it difficult to refrain from a bitter tone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess he must have forgotten,&quot; exclaimed his wife
                        blandly.</p>
                    <p>In the past he had always commanded a certain amount of respect, which was a
                        compound of appreciation and awe. The familiarity which in part still
                        existed between himself and his daughter he had courted. As it was, it slid
                        not go beyond the light assumption of words. The <hi rend="i">tone</hi> was
                        always modest. Whatever had been, however, had lacked affection, and now he
                        saw that he was losing track of their doings. His knowledge was no longer
                        intimate. He sometimes saw them at table, and sometimes slid not. He heard
                        of their doings occasionally, more often not. Some clays he found that he
                        was all at sea as to what they were talking aboutthings they had arranged to
                        do or that they had done in his absence. More affecting was the feeling that
                        there were little things going on of which he no longer heard. Jessica was
                        beginning to feel that her affairs were her own. George, Jr., flourished
                        about as if he were a man entirely and must needs <pb id="VAA2423-164"
                            n="158"/> have private matters. All this Hurstwood could see, and it
                        left a trace of feeling, for he was used to being consideredin his official
                        position, at leastand felt that his importance should not begin to wane
                        here. To darken it all, he saw the same indifference and independence
                        growing in his wife, while he looked on and paid the bills.</p>
                    <p>He consoled himself with the thought, however, that, after all, he was not
                        without affection. Things might go as they would at his house, but he had
                        Carrie outside of it. With his mind&apos;s eye he looked into her
                        comfortable room in Ogden Place, where he had spent several such delightful
                        evenings, and thought how charming it would be when Drouet was disposed of
                        entirely and she was waiting evenings in cosey little quarters for him. That
                        no cause would come up whereby Drouet would be led to inform Carrie
                        concerning his married state, he felt hopeful. Things were going to smoothly
                        that he believed they would not change. Shortly now he would persuade Carrie
                        and all would be satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>The day after their theatre visit he began writing her regularlya letter
                        every morning, and begging her to do as much for him. He was not literary by
                        any means, but experience of the world and his growing affection gave him
                        somewhat of a style. This he exercised at his office desk with perfect
                        deliberation. He purchased a box of delicately coloured and scented writing
                        paper in monogram, which he kept locked in one of the drawers. His friends
                        now wondered at the cleric and very official-looking nature of his position.
                        The five bartenders viewed with respect the duties which could call a man to
                        do so much desk-work and penmanship.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood surprised himself with his fluency. By the natural law which
                        governs all effort, what he wrote reacted upon him. He began to feel those
                        subtleties which he <pb id="VAA2423-165" n="159"/> could find words to
                        express. With every expression came increased conception. Those inmost
                        breathings which there found words took hold upon him. He thought Carrie
                        worthy of all the affection he could there express.</p>
                    <p>Carrie was indeed worth loving if ever youth and grace are to command that
                        token of acknowledgment front life in their bloom. Experience had not yet
                        taken away that freshness of the spirit which is the charm of the body. Her
                        soft eyes contained in their liquid lustre no suggestion of the knowledge of
                        disappointment. She had been troubled in a way by doubt and longing, but
                        these had made no deeper impression than could be traced in a certain open
                        wistfulness of glance and speech. The mouth had the expression at times, in
                        talking and in repose, of one who might be upon the verge of tears. It was
                        not that grief was thus ever present. The pronunciation of certain syllables
                        gave to her lips this peculiarity of formationa formation as suggestive and
                        moving as pathos itself.</p>
                    <p>There was nothing bold in her manner. Life had not taught her
                        dominationsuperciliousness of grace, which is the lordly power of some
                        women. Her longing for consideration was not sufficiently powerful to move
                        her to demand it. Even now she lacked self-assurance, but there was that in
                        what she had already experienced which left her a little less than timid.
                        She wanted pleasure, she wanted position, and yet she was confused as to
                        what these things might be. Every hour the kaleidoscope of human affairs
                        threw a new lustre upon something, and therewith it became for her the
                        desiredthe all. Another shift of the box, and some other had become the
                        beautiful, the perfect.</p>
                    <p>On her spiritual side, also, she was rich in feeling, as such a nature well
                        might be. Sorrow in her was aroused by many a spectaclean uncritical
                        upwelling of grief for <pb id="VAA2423-166" n="160"/> the weak and the
                        helpless. She was constantly pained by the sight of the white-faced, ragged
                        men who slopped desperately by her in a sort of wretched mental stupor. The
                        poorly clad girls who went blowing by her window evenings, hurrying home
                        from some of the shops of the West Side, she pitied from the depths of her
                        heart. She would stand and bite her lips as they passed, shaking her little
                        head and wondering. They had so little, she thought. It was so sad to be
                        ragged and poor. The hang of faded clothes pained her eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And they have to work so hard!&quot; was her only comment.</p>
                    <p>On the street sometimes she would see men workingIrishmen with picks,
                        coal-heavers with great loads to shovel, Americans busy about some work
                        which was a mere matter of strengthand they touched her fancy. Tail, now
                        that she was free of it, seemed even a more desolate thing than when she was
                        part of it. She saw it through a mist of fancya pale, sombre half-light,
                        which was the essence of poetic feeling. Her old father, in his flour-dusted
                        miller&apos;s suit, sometimes returned to her in memory, revived by a
                        face in a window. A shoemaker pegging at his last, a blastman seen through a
                        narrow window in some basement where iron was being melted, a bench-worker
                        seen high aloft in some window, his coat off, his sleeves rolled up; these
                        took her back in fancy to the details of the mill. She felt, though she
                        seldom expressed them, sad thoughts upon this score. Her sympathies were
                        ever with that under-world of toil from which she had to recently sprung,
                        and which she best understood.</p>
                    <p>Though Hurstwood did not know it, he was dealing with one whose feelings were
                        as tender and as delicate as this. He did not know, but it was this in her,
                        after all, which attracted him. He never attempted to analyse the nature of
                        his affection. It was sufficient that there was <pb id="VAA2423-167" n="161"
                        /> tenderness in her eye, weakness in her manner, good-nature and hope in
                        her thoughts. He drew near this lily, which had sucked its waxen beauty and
                        perfume front below a depth of waters which he had never penetrated, and out
                        of ooze and mould which he could not understand. He drew near because it was
                        waxen and fresh. It lightened his feelings for him. It made the morning
                        worth while.</p>
                    <p>In a material way, she was considerably improved. Her awkwardness had all but
                        passed, leaving, if anything, a quaint residue which was as pleasing as
                        perfect grace. Her little shoes now fitted her smartly and had high heels.
                        She had learned much about laces and those little neckpieces which add so
                        much to a woman&apos;s appearance. Her form had filled out until it was
                        admirably plump and well-rounded.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood wrote her one morning, asking her to meet him in Jefferson Park,
                        Monroe Street. He did not consider it policy to call any more, even when
                        Drouet was at home.</p>
                    <p>The next afternoon he was in the pretty little park by one, and had found a
                        rustic bench beneath the green leaves of a lilac bush which bordered one of
                        the paths. It was at that season of the year when the fulness of spring had
                        not yet worn quite away. At a little pond near by some cleanly dressed
                        children were sailing white canvas boats. In the shade of a green pagoda a
                        bebuttoned officer of the law was resting, his arms folded, his club at rest
                        in his belt. An old gardener was upon the lawn, with a pair of pruning
                        shears, looking after some bushes. High overhead was the clear blue sky of
                        the new summer, and in the thickness of the shiny green leaves of the trees
                        hopped and twittered the busy sparrows.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood had come out of his own home that morning feeling much of the same
                        old annoyance. At his store he had idled, there being no need to write. He
                        had <pb id="VAA2423-168" n="162"/> come away to this place with the
                        lightness of heart which characterises those who put weariness behind. Now,
                        in the shade of this cool, green bush, he looked about him with the fancy of
                        the lover. He heard the carts go lumbering by upon the neighbouring streets,
                        but they were far off, and only buzzed upon his ear. The hum of the
                        surrounding city was faint, the clang of an occasional bell was as music. He
                        looked and dreamed a new dream of pleasure which concerned his present fixed
                        condition not at all. He got back in fancy to the old Hurstwood, who was
                        neither married nor fixed in a solid position for life. He remembered the
                        light spirit in which he once looked after the girlshow he had danced,
                        escorted them home, hung over their gates. He almost wished he was back
                        there againhere in this pleasant scene he felt as if he were wholly
                        free.</p>
                    <p>At two Carrie came tripping along the walk toward him, rosy and clean. She
                        had just recently donned a sailor hat for the season with a band of pretty
                        white-dotted blue silk. Her skirt was of a rich blue material, and her shirt
                        waist matched it, with a thin stripe of blue upon a snow-white groundstripes
                        that were as fine as hairs. Her brown shoes peeped occasionally from beneath
                        her skirt. She carried her gloves in her hand.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood looked up at her with delight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You came, dearest,&quot; he said eagerly, standing to meet her
                        and taking her hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course,&quot; she said, smiling; &quot;did you think I
                        wouldn&apos;t?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t know,&quot; he replied.</p>
                    <p>He looked at her forehead, which was moist from her brisk walk. Then he took
                        out one of his own soft, scented silk handkerchiefs and touched her face
                        here and there.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now,&quot; he said affectionately, &quot;you&apos;re
                        all right.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-169" n="163"/>
                    <p>They were happy in being near one anotherin looking into each
                        other&apos;s eyes. Finally, when the long flush of delight had subsided,
                        he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;When is Charlie going away again?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she answered. &quot;He says he
                        has some things to do for the house here now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood grew serious, and he lapsed into quiet thought. He looked up after
                        a time to say:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come away and leave him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned his eyes to the boys with the boats, as if the request were of
                        little importance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where would we go?&quot; she asked in much the same manner,
                        rolling her gloves, and looking into a neighbouring tree.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where do you want to go?&quot; he enquired.</p>
                    <p>There was something in the tone in which he said this which made her feel as
                        if she must record her feelings against any local habitation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We can&apos;t stay in Chicago,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>He had no thought that this was in her mindthat any removal would be
                        suggested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot; he asked softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, because,&quot; she said, &quot;I wouldn&apos;t want
                        to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He listened to this with but dull perception of what it meant. It had no
                        serious ring to it. The question was not up for immediate decision.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would have to give up my position,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>The tone he used made it seem as if the matter deserved only slight
                        consideration. Carrie thought a little, the while enjoying the pretty
                        scene.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t like to live in Chicago and him here,&quot;
                        she said, thinking of Drouct.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a big town, dearest,&quot; Hurstwood answered.
                        &quot;It would be as good as moving to another part of the country to
                        move to the South Side.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-170" n="164"/>
                    <p>He had fixed upon that region as an objective point.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anyhow,&quot; said Carrie, &quot;I shouldn&apos;t want
                        to get married as long as he is here. I wouldn&apos;t want to run
                        away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The suggestion of marriage struck Hurstwood forcibly. He saw clearly that
                        this was her ideahe felt that it was not to be gotten over easily. Bigamy
                        lightened the horizon of his shadowy thoughts for a moment. He wondered for
                        the life of him how it would all come out. He could not see that he was
                        making any progress save in her regard. When he looked at her now, he
                        thought her beautiful. What a thing it was to have her love him, even if it
                        be entangling! Site increased in value in his eyes because of her objection.
                        She was something to struggle for, and that was everything. How different
                        from the women who yielded willingly! He swept the thought of them from his
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you don&apos;t know when he&apos;ll go away?&quot;
                        asked Hurstwood, quietly.</p>
                    <p>She shook her head.</p>
                    <p>He sighed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yqu&apos;re a determined little miss, aren&apos;t
                        you?&quot; he said, after a few moments, looking up into her eyes.</p>
                    <p>She felt a wave of feeling sweep over her at this. It was pride at what
                        seemed his admirationaffection for the man who could feel this concerning
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she said coyly, &quot;but what can I
                        do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again he folded his hands and looked away over the lawn into the street.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish,&quot; he said pathetically, &quot;you would come to
                        me. I don&apos;t like to be away from you this way. What good is there
                        in waiting? You&apos;re not any happier, are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Happier!&quot; she exclaimed softly, &quot;you know better
                        than that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here we are then,&quot; he went on in the same tone,</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-171" n="165"/>
                    <p>&quot;wasting our days. If you are not happy, do you think I am? I sit
                        and write to you the biggest part of the time. I&apos;ll tell you what,
                        Carrie,&quot; he exclaimed, throwing sudden force of expression into his
                        voice and fixing her with his eyes, &quot;I can&apos;t live without
                        you, and that&apos;s all there is to it. Now,&quot; he concluded,
                        showing the palm of one of his white hands in a sort of at-an-end, helpless
                        expression, &quot;what shall I do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>This shifting of the burden to her appealed to Carrie. The semblance of the
                        load without the weight touched the woman&apos;s heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t you wait a little while yet?&quot; she said
                        tenderly. &quot;I&apos;ll try and find out when he&apos;s
                        going.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What good will it do?&quot; he asked, holding the same strain
                        of feeling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, perhaps we can arrange to go somewhere.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She really did not see anything clearer than before, but she was getting into
                        that frame of mind where, out of sympathy, a woman yields.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood slid not understand. He was wondering how she was to be
                        persuadedwhat appeal would move her to forsake Drouet. He began to wonder
                        how far her affection for him would carry her. He was thinking of some
                        question which would make her tell.</p>
                    <p>Finally he hit upon one of those problematical propositions which often
                        disguise our own desires while leading us to an understanding of the
                        difficulties which others make for us, and so discover for us a way. It had
                        not the slightest connection with anything intended on his part, and was
                        spoken at random before he had given it a moment&apos;s serious
                        thought.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Carrie,&quot; he said, looking into her face and assuming a
                        serious look which he did not feel, &quot;suppose I were to come to you
                        next week, or this week for that mattertonight sayand tell you I had to go
                        awaythat I couldn&apos;t <pb id="VAA2423-172" n="166"/> stay another
                        minute and wasn&apos;t coming back any morewould you come with
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>His sweetheart viewed him with the most affectionate glance, her answer ready
                        before the words were out of his mouth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You wouldn&apos;t stop to argue or arrange?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not if you couldn&apos;t wait.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He smiled when he saw that she took him seriously, and he thought what a
                        chance it would afford for a possible junket of a week or two. He had a
                        notion to tell her that he was joking and so brush away her sweet
                        seriousness, but the effect of it was too delightful. He let it stand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Suppose we didn&apos;t have time to get married here?&quot;
                        he added, an afterthought striking him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If we got married as soon as we got to the other end of the journey
                        it would be all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I meant that,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The morning seemed peculiarly bright to him now. He wondered whatever could
                        have put such a thought into his head. Impossible as it was, he could not
                        help smiling at its cleverness. It showed how she loved him. There was no
                        doubt in his mind now, and he would find a way to win her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, jokingly, &quot;I&apos;ll come and
                        get you one of these evenings,&quot; and then he laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t stay with you, though, if you didn&apos;t
                        marry me,&quot; Carrie added reflectively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want you to,&quot; he said tenderly, taking
                        her hand.</p>
                    <p>She was extremely happy now that she understood. She loved him the more for
                        thinking that he would rescue her so. As for him, the marriage clause did
                        not dwell in <pb id="VAA2423-173" n="167"/> his mind. He was thinking that
                        with such affection there could be no bar to his eventual happiness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s stroll about,&quot; he said gayly, rising and
                        surveying all the lovely park.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>They passed the young Irishman, who looked after them with envious eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Tis a foine couple,&quot; he observed to himself.
                        &quot;They must be rich.&quot;</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">A WITLESS ALADDIN: THE GATE TO THE WORLD</head>
                    <p>In the course of his present stay in Chicago, Drouet paid some slight
                        attention to the secret order to which he belonged. During his last trip he
                        had received a new light on its importance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I tell you,&quot; said another drummer to him,
                        &quot;it&apos;s a great thing. Look at Hazenstab. He isn&apos;t
                        so deuced clever. Of course he&apos;s got a good house behind him, but
                        that won&apos;t do alone. I tell you it&apos;s his degree.
                        He&apos;s a way-up Mason, and that goes a long way. He&apos;s got a
                        secret sign that stands for something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet resolved then and there that he would take more interest in such
                        matters. So when he got back to Chicago he repaired to his local lodge
                        headquarters.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I say, Drouet,&quot; said Mr. Harry Quincel, an individual who
                        was very prominent in this local branch of the Elks,
                        &quot;you&apos;re the man that can help us out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was after the business meeting and things were going socially with a hum.
                        Drouet was bobbing around chatting and joking with a score of individuals
                        whom he knew.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you up to?&quot; he inquired genially, turning a
                        smiling face upon his secret brother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;re trying to get up some theatricals for two weeks from
                        to-day, and we want to know if you don&apos;t know some young lady who
                        could take a partit&apos;s an easy part.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure,&quot; said Drouet, &quot;what is it?&quot; He did
                        not trouble to remember that he knew no one to whom he could <pb
                            id="VAA2423-175" n="169"/> appeal on this score. His innate good-nature,
                        however, dictated a favourable reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, now, I&apos;ll tell you what we are trying to
                        do,&quot; went on Mr. Quincel. &quot;We are trying to get a new set
                        of furniture for the lodge. There isn&apos;t enough money in the
                        treasury at the present time, and we thought we would raise it by a little
                        entertainment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure,&quot; interrupted Drouet, &quot;that&apos;s a
                        good idea.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Several of the boys around here have got talent. There&apos;s
                        Harry Burbeck, he does a fine black-face turn. Mac Lewis is all right at
                        heavy dramatics. Did you ever hear him recite &apos;Over the
                        Hills&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I tell you, he does it fine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you want me to get some woman to take a part?&quot;
                        questioned Drouet, anxious to terminate the subject and get on to something
                        else. &quot;What are you going to play?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Under the Gaslight,&apos;&quot; said Mr. Quincel,
                        mentioning Augustin Daly&apos;s famous production, which had worn from a
                        great public success down to an amateur theatrical favourite, with many of
                        the troublesome accessories cut out and the <hi rend="i">dramatis
                            persona</hi> reduced to the smallest possible number.</p>
                    <p>Drouet had seen this play some time in the past.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s it,&quot; he said; &quot;that&apos;s a
                        fine play. It will go all right. You ought to make a lot of money out of
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We think we&apos;ll do very well,&quot; Mr. Quincel
                        replied. &quot;Don&apos;t you forget now,&quot; he concluded,
                        Drouet showing signs of restlessness; &quot;some young woman to take the
                        part of Laura.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure, I&apos;ll attend to it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He moved away, forgetting almost all about it the moment Mr. Quincel had
                        ceased talking. He had not even thought to ask the time or place.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-176" n="170"/>
                    <p>Drouet was reminded of his promise a day or two later by the receipt of a
                        letter announcing that the first rehearsal was set for the following Friday
                        evening, and urging him to kindly forward the young lady&apos;s address
                        at once, in order that the part might be delivered to her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, who the deuce do I know?&quot; asked the drummer
                        reflectively, scratching his rosy ear. &quot;I don&apos;t know any
                        one that knows anything about amateur theatricals.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went over in memory the names of a number of women he knew, and finally
                        fixed on one, largely because of the convenient location of her home on the
                        West Side, and promised himself that as he came out that evening he would
                        see her. When, however, he started west on the car he forgot, and was only
                        reminded of his delinquency by an item in the &quot;Evening
                        News&quot;a small three-line affair under the head of Secret Society
                        Noteswhich stated the Custer Lodge of the Order of Elks would give a
                        theatrical performance in Avery Hall on the 16th, when &quot;Under the
                        Gaslight&quot; would be produced.</p>
                    <p>&quot;George!&quot; exclaimed Drouet, &quot;I forgot
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot; inquired Carrie.</p>
                    <p>They were at their little table in the room which might have been used for a
                        kitchen, where Carrie occasionally served a meal. To-night the fancy had
                        caught her, and the little table was spread with a pleasing repast.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, my lodge entertainment. They&apos;re going to give a play,
                        and they wanted me to get them some young lady to take a part.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it they&apos;re going to play?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Under the Gaslight.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;On the 16th.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, why don&apos;t you.&quot; asked Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know any one,&quot; he replied.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-177" n="171"/>
                    <p>Suddenly he looked up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say,&quot; he said, &quot;how would you like to take the
                        part?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Me?&quot; said Carrie. &quot;I can&apos;t
                        act.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you know?&quot; questioned Drouet reflectively.
                        &quot;Because,&quot; answered Carrie, &quot;I never
                        did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, she was pleased to think he would ask. Her eyes brightened, for
                        if there was anything that enlisted her sympathies it was the art of the
                        stage.</p>
                    <p>True to his nature, Drouet clung to this idea as an easy way out.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s nothing. You can act all you have to down
                        there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I can&apos;t,&quot; said Carrie weakly, very much drawn
                        toward the proposition and yet fearful.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you can. Now, why don&apos;t you its it? They need some
                        one, and it will be lots of fun for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no, it won&apos;t,&quot; said Carrie seriously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d like that. I know you would. I&apos;ve seen you
                        dancing around here and giving imitations and that&apos;s why I asked
                        you. You&apos;re clever enough, all right&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I&apos;m not,&quot; said Carrie shyly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, I&apos;ll tell you what you do. You go down and see about
                        it. It&apos;ll be fun for you. The rest of the company isn&apos;t
                        going to be any good. They haven&apos;t any experience. What do they
                        know about theatricals?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He frowned as he thought of their ignorance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hand me the coffee,&quot; he added.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t believe I could act, Charlie,&quot; Carrie
                        went on pettishly. &quot;You don&apos;t think I could, do
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure. Out o&apos; sight. I bet you make a hit. Now you want to
                        go, I know you do. I knew it when I came home. That&apos;s why I asked
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is the play, did you say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Under the Gaslight.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What part would they want me to take?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-178" n="172"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, one of the heroinesI don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What sort of a play is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Drouet, whose memory for such things was not
                        the best, &quot;it&apos;s about a girl who gets kidnapped by a
                        couple of crooksa man and a woman that live in the slums. She had some money
                        or something and they wanted to get it. I don&apos;t know now how it did
                        go exactly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you know what part I would have to
                        take?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I don&apos;t, to tell the truth.&quot; He thought a
                        moment. &quot;Yes, I do, too. Laura, that&apos;s the
                        thingyou&apos;re to be Laura.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you can&apos;t remember what the part is
                        like?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To save me, Cad, I can&apos;t,&quot; he answered.
                        &quot;I ought to, too; I&apos;ve seen the play enough.
                        There&apos;s a girl in it that was stolen when she was an infantwas
                        picked off the street or somethingand she&apos;s the one that&apos;s
                        hounded by the two old criminals I was telling you about.&quot; He
                        stopped with a mouthful of pie poised on a fork before his face.
                        &quot;She comes very near getting drownedno, that&apos;s not it.
                        I&apos;ll tell you what I&apos;ll do,&quot; he concluded
                        hopelessly, &quot;I&apos;ll get you the book. I can&apos;t
                        remember now for the life of me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Carrie, when he had
                        concluded, her interest and desire to shine dramatically struggling with her
                        timidity for the mastery. &quot;I might go if you thought I&apos;d
                        do all right&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, you&apos;ll do,&quot; said Drouet, who, in his
                        efforts to enthuse Carrie, had interested himself. &quot;Do you think
                        I&apos;d come home here and urge you to do something that I
                        didn&apos;t think you would make a success of? You can act all right.
                        It&apos;ll be good for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When mast I go?&quot; said Carrie, reflectively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The first rehearsal is Friday night. I&apos;ll get the part for
                        you to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-179" n="173"/>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Carrie resignedly,
                        &quot;I&apos;ll do it, but if I make a failure now it&apos;s
                        your fault.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You won&apos;t fail,&quot; assured Drouet. &quot;Just
                        act as you do around here. Be natural. You&apos;re all right.
                        I&apos;ve often thought you&apos;d make a corking good
                        actress.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you really?&quot; asked Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; said the drummer.</p>
                    <p>He little knew as he went out of the door that night what a secret flame he
                        had kindled in the bosom of the girl he left behind. Carrie was possessed of
                        that sympathetic, impressionable nature which, ever in the most developed
                        form, has been the glory of the drama. She was created with that passivity
                        of soul which is always the mirror of the active world. She possessed an
                        innate taste for imitation and no small ability. Even without practice, she
                        could sometimes restore dramatic situations she had witnessed by
                        re-creating, before her mirror, the expressions of the various faces taking
                        part in the scene. She loved to modulate her voice after the conventional
                        manner of the distressed heroine, and repeat such pathetic fragments as
                        appealed most to her sympathies. Of late, seeing the airy grace of the <hi
                            rend="i">ingenue</hi> in several well-constructed plays, she had been
                        moved to secretly imitate it, and many were the little movements and
                        expressions of the body in which she indulged from time to time in the
                        privacy of her chamber. On several occasions, when Drouet had caught her
                        admiring herself, as he imagined, in the mirror, she was doing nothing more
                        than recalling some little grace of the mouth or the eyes which she had
                        witnessed in another. Under his airy accusation she mistook this for vanity
                        and accepted the blame with a faint sense of error, though, as a matter of
                        fact, it was nothing more than the first subtle outcroppings of an artistic
                        nature, endeavouring to re-create the perfect likeness of some phase of
                        beauty which appealed to her. In such <pb id="VAA2423-180" n="174"/> feeble
                        tendencies, be it known, such outworking of desire to reproduce life, lies
                        the basis of all dramatic art.</p>
                    <p>Now, when Carrie heard Drouet&apos;s laudatory opinion of her dramatic
                        ability, her body tingled with satisfaction. Like the flame which welds the
                        loosened particles into a solid mass, his words united those floating wisps
                        of feeling which she had felt, but never believed, concerning her possible
                        ability, and made them into a gaudy shred of hope. Like all human beings,
                        she had a touch of vanity. She felt that she could do things if she only had
                        a chance. How often had she looked at the well-dressed actresses on the
                        stage and wondered how she would look, how delightful she would feel if only
                        she were in their place. The glamour, the tense situation, the fine clothes,
                        the applause, these had lured her until she felt that site, too, could
                        actthat site, too, could compel acknowledgment of power. Now site was told
                        that she really couldthat little things she had done about the house had
                        made even him feel her power. It was a delightful sensation while it
                        lasted.</p>
                    <p>When Drouet was gone, she sat down in her rocking-chair by the window to
                        think about it. As usual, imagination exaggerated the possibilities for her.
                        It was as if he had put fifty cents in her hand and she had exercised the
                        thoughts of a thousand dollars. She saw herself in a score of pathetic
                        situations in which she assumed a tremulous voice and suffering manner. Her
                        mind delighted itself with scenes of luxury and refinement, situations in
                        which site was the cynosure of all eyes, the arbiter of all fates. As she
                        rocked to and fro site felt the tensity of woe in abandonment, the
                        magnificence of wrath after deception, the languour of sorrow after defeat.
                        Thoughts of all the charming women she had seen in playsevery fancy, every
                        illusion which she had concerning the stagenow came back as a returning tide
                        after the ebb. She built <pb id="VAA2423-181" n="175"/> up feelings and a
                        determination which the occasion did not warrant.</p>
                    <p>Drouet dropped in at the lodge when he went down town, and swashed around
                        with a great <hi rend="i">air</hi>, as Quincel met him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is that young lady you were going to get for us?&quot;
                        asked the latter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve got her,&quot; said Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you?&quot; said Quincel, rather surprised by his
                        promptness; &quot;that&apos;s good. What&apos;s her
                        address?&quot; and he pulled out his note-book in order to be able to
                        send her part to her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You want to send her her part?&quot; asked the drummer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll take it. I&apos;m going right by her house
                        in the morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did you say her address was? We only want it in case we have
                        any information to send her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Twenty-nine Ogden Place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And her name?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Carrie Madenda,&quot; said the drummer, firing at random. The
                        lodge members knew him to be single.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That sounds like somebody that can act, doesn&apos;t
                        it?&quot; said Quincel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, it does.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took the part home to Carrie and handed it to her with the manner of one
                        who does a favour.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He says that&apos;s the best part. Do you think you can do
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know until I look it over. You know I&apos;m
                        afraid, now that I&apos;ve said I would.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, go on. What have you got to be afraid of? It&apos;s a cheap
                        company. The rest of them aren&apos;t as good as you are.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-182" n="176"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll see,&quot; said Carrie, pleased to have the
                        part, for all her misgivings.</p>
                    <p>He sidled around, dressing and fidgeting before he arranged to make his next
                        remark.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They were getting ready to print the programmes,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;and I gave them the name of Carrie Madenda. Was that all
                        right?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I guess so,&quot; said his companion, looking up at him.
                        She was thinking it was slightly strange.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you didn&apos;t make a hit, you know,&quot; he went
                        on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she answered, rather pleased now with his
                        caution. It was clever for Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t want to introduce you as my wife, because
                        you&apos;d feel worse then if you didn&apos;t <hi rend="i">go.</hi>
                        They all know use so well. But you&apos;ll <hi rend="i">go</hi> all
                        right. Anyhow, you&apos;ll probably never meet any of them
                        again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t care,&quot; said Carrie desperately. She
                        was determined now to have a try at the fascinating game.</p>
                    <p>Drouet breathed a sigh of relief. He had been afraid that he was about to
                        precipitate another conversation upon the marriage question.</p>
                    <p>The part of Laura, as Carrie found out when she began to examine it, was one
                        of suffering and tears. As delineated by Mr. Daly, it was true to the most
                        sacred traditions of melodrama as he found it when he began his career. The
                        sorrowful demeanour, the tremolo music, the long, explanatory, cumulative
                        addresses, all were there.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Poor fellow,&quot; read Carrie, consulting the text and drawing
                        her voice out pathetically. &quot;Martin, be sure and give him a glass
                        of wine before he goes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was surprised at the briefness of the entire part, not knowing that she
                        must be on the stage while others were talking, and not only be there, but
                        also keep herself in harmony with the dramatic movement of the scenes.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-183" n="177"/>
                    <p>&quot;I think I can do that, though,&quot; she concluded.</p>
                    <p>When Drouet came the next night, she was very much satisfied with her
                        day&apos;s study.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, how goes it, Caddie?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; she laughed. &quot;I think I have it
                        memorised nearly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s good,&quot; he said. &quot;Let&apos;s
                        hear some of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know whether I can get up and say it off
                        here,&quot; she said bashfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know why you shouldn&apos;t.
                        It&apos;ll be easier here than it will there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know about that,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>Eventually she took off the ball-room episode with considerable feeling,
                        forgetting, as she got deeper in the scene, all about Drouet, and letting
                        herself rise to a fine state of feeling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good,&quot; said Drouet; &quot;fine; out o&apos; sight!
                        You&apos;re all right, Caddie, I tell you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was really moved by her excellent representation and the general
                        appearance of the pathetic little figure as it swayed and finally fainted to
                        the floor. He had bounded up to catch her, and now held her laughing in his
                        arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ain&apos;t you afraid you&apos;ll hurt yourself? &quot;
                        he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not a bit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you&apos;re a wonder. Say, I never knew you could do
                        anything like that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never did, either,&quot; said Carrie merrily, her face
                        flushed with delight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you can bet that you&apos;re all right,&quot; said
                        Drouet. &quot;You can take my word for that. You won&apos;t
                        fail.&quot;</p>

                        EYE</head>
                    <p>The, to Carrie, very important theatrical performance was to take place at
                        the Avery on conditions which were to make it more noteworthy than was at
                        first anticipated. The little dramatic student had written to Hurstwood the
                        very morning her part was brought her that she was going to take part in a
                        play.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I really am,&quot; she wrote, feeling that he might take it as
                        a jest; &quot;I have my part now, honest, truly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood smiled in an indulgent way as he read this.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder what it is going to be? I must see that.&quot; He
                        answered at once, making a pleasant reference to her ability. &quot;I
                        haven&apos;t the slightest doubt you will make a success. You must come
                        to the park to-morrow morning and tell me all about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie gladly complied, and revealed all the details of the undertaking as
                        she understood it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;that&apos;s fine.
                        I&apos;m glad to hear it. Of course, you will do well, you&apos;re
                        so clever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had truly never seen so much spirit in the girl before. Her tendency to
                        discover a touch of sadness had for the nonce disappeared. As she spoke her
                        eyes were bright, her cheeks red. She radiated much of the pleasure which
                        her undertakings gave her. For all her misgivings and they were as plentiful
                        as the moments of the dayshe was still happy. She could not repress her
                        delight in <pb id="VAA2423-185" n="179"/> doing this little thing which, to
                        an ordinary observer, had no importance at all.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was charmed by the development of the fact that the girl had
                        capabilities. There is nothing so inspiring in life as the sight of a
                        legitimate ambition, no matter how incipient. It gives colour, force, and
                        beauty to the possessor.</p>
                    <p>Carrie was now lightened by a touch of this divine afflatus. She drew to
                        herself commendation from her two admirers which she had not earned. Their
                        affection for her naturally heightened their perception of what she was
                        trying to do and their approval of what she did. Her inexperience conserved
                        her own exuberant fancy, which ran riot with every straw of opportunity,
                        making of it a golden divining rod whereby the treasure of life was to be
                        discovered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s see,&quot; said Hurstwood, &quot;I ought to
                        know some of the boys in the lodge. I&apos;m an Elk
                        myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you mustn&apos;t let him know I told you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s so,&quot; said the manager.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d like for you to be there, if you want to come, but I
                        don&apos;t see how you can unless he asks you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll be there,&quot; said Hurstwood affectionately.
                        &quot;I can fix it so he won&apos;t know you told me. You leave it
                        to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This interest of the manager was a large thing in itself for the performance,
                        for his standing among the Elks was something worth talking about. Already
                        he was thinking of a box with some friends, and flowers for Carrie. He would
                        make it a dress-suit affair and give the little girl a chance.</p>
                    <p>Within a day or two, Drouet dropped into the Adams Street resort, and he was
                        at once spied by Hurstwood. It was at five in the afternoon and the place
                        was crowded with merchants, actors, managers, politicians, a goodly <pb
                            id="VAA2423-186" n="180"/> company of rotund, rosy figures, silk-hatted,
                        starchy-bosomed, beringed and bescarfpinned to the queen&apos;s taste.
                        John L. Sullivan, the pugilist, was at one end of the glittering bar,
                        surrounded by a company of loudly dressed sports, who were holding a most
                        animated conversation. Drouet came across the floor with a festive stride, a
                        new pair of tan shoes squeaking audibly at his progress.</p>
                    <p>Well, sir,&quot; said Hurstwood, &quot;I was wondering what had
                        become of you. I thought you had gone out of town again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you don&apos;t report more regularly we&apos;ll have to
                        cut you off the list.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Couldn&apos;t help it,&quot; said the drummer,
                        &quot;I&apos;ve been busy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They strolled over toward the bar amid the noisy, shifting company of
                        notables. The dressy manager was shaken by the hand three times in as many
                        minutes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hear your lodge is going to give a performance,&quot;
                        observed Hurstwood, in the most offhand manner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, who told you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No one,&quot; said Hurstwood. &quot;They just sent me a
                        couple of tickets, which I can have for two dollars. Is it going to be any
                        good?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; replied the drummer.
                        &quot;They&apos;ve been trying to get me to get some woman to take a
                        part.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wasn&apos;t intending to go,&quot; said the manager
                        easily. &quot;I&apos;ll subscribe, of course. How are things over
                        there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right. They&apos;re going to fit things up out of the
                        proceeds.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the manager, &quot;I hope they make a
                        success of it. Have another?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He did not intend to say any more. Now, if he should appear on the scene with
                        a few friends, he could say that <pb id="VAA2423-187" n="181"/> he had been
                        urged to come along. Drouet had a desire to wipe out the possibility of
                        confusion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think the girl is going to take a part in it,&quot; he said
                        abruptly, after thinking it over.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t say so! How did that happen?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, they were short and wanted me to find them some one. I told
                        Carrie, and she seems to want to try.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good for her,&quot; said the manager. &quot;It&apos;ll
                        be a real nice affair. Do her good, too. Has she ever had any
                        experience?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not a bit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, well, it isn&apos;t anything very serious.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s clever, though,&quot; said Drouet, casting off
                        any imputation against Carrie&apos;s ability. &quot;She picks up her
                        part quick enough.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t say so!&quot; said the manager.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir; she surprised me the other night. By George, if she
                        didn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We must give her a nice little send-off,&quot; said the
                        manager. &quot;I&apos;ll look after the flowers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet smiled at his good-nature.</p>
                    <p>&quot;After the show you must come with me and we&apos;ll have a
                        little supper.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think she&apos;ll do all right,&quot; said Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to see her. She&apos;s got to do all right.
                        We&apos;ll make her,&quot; and the manager gave one of his quick,
                        steely half-smiles, which was a compound of good-nature and shrewdness.</p>
                    <p>Carrie, meanwhile, attended the first rehearsal. At this performance Mr.
                        Quincel presided, aided by Mr. Millice, a young man who had some
                        qualifications of past experience, which were not exactly understood by any
                        one. He was so experienced and so business-like, however, that he came very
                        near being rudefailing to remember, as <pb id="VAA2423-188" n="182"/> he
                        did, that the individuals he was trying to instruct were volunteer players
                        and not salaried underlings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, Miss Madenda,&quot; he said, addressing Carrie, who stood
                        in one part uncertain as to what move to make, &quot;you don&apos;t
                        want to stand like that. Put expression in your face. Remember, you are
                        troubled over the intrusion of the stranger. Walk so,&quot; and he
                        struck out across the Avery stage in a most drooping manner.</p>
                    <p>Carrie did not exactly fancy the suggestion, but the novelty of the
                        situation, the presence of strangers, all more or less nervous, and the
                        desire to do anything rather than make a failure, made her timid. She walked
                        in imitation of her mentor as requested, inwardly feeling that there was
                        something strangely lacking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, Mrs. Morgan,&quot; said the director to one young married
                        woman who was to take the part of Pearl, &quot;you sit here. Now, Mr.
                        Bamberger, you stand here, so. Now, what is it you say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Explain,&quot; said Mr. Bamberger feebly. He had the part of
                        Ray, Laura&apos;s lover, the society individual who was to waver in his
                        thoughts of marrying her, upon finding that she was a waif and a nobody by
                        birth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How is thatwhat does your text say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Explain,&quot; repeated Mr. Bamberger, looking intently at his
                        part.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but it also says,&quot; the director remarked,
                        &quot;that you are to look shocked. Now, say it again, and see if you
                        can&apos;t look shocked.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Explain!&quot; demanded Mr. Bamberger vigorously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no, that won&apos;t do! Say it this way<hi rend="i"
                            >explain.&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Explain,&quot; said Mr. Bamberger, giving a modified
                        imitation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s better. Now go on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;One night,&quot; resumed Mrs. Morgan, whose lines came next,
                        &quot;father and mother were going to the opera.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-189" n="183"/>
                    <p>When they were crossing Broadway, the usual crowd of children accosted them
                        for alms&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold on,&quot; said the director, rushing forward, his arm
                        extended. &quot;Put more feeling into what you are saying.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Morgan looked at him as if she feared a personal assault. Her eye
                        lightened with resentment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Remember, Mrs. Morgan,&quot; he added, ignoring the gleam, but
                        modifying his manner, &quot;that you&apos;re detailing a pathetic
                        story. You are now supposed to be telling something that is a grief to you.
                        It requires feeling, repression, thus: &apos;The usual crowd of children
                        accosted them for alms.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Mrs. Morgan.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, go on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;As mother felt in her pocket for some change, her fingers touched a
                        cold and trembling hand which had clutched her purse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very good,&quot; interrupted the director, nodding his head
                        significantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A pickpocket! Well!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Bamberger, speaking the
                        lines that here fell to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no, Mr. Bomberger,&quot; said the director, approaching,
                        &quot;not that way. &apos;A pickpocketwell?&apos; so.
                        That&apos;s the idea.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you think,&quot; said Carrie weakly, noticing
                        that it had not been proved yet whether the members of the company knew
                        their lines, let alone the details of expression, &quot;that it would be
                        better if we just went through our lines once to see if we know them? We
                        might pick up some points.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A very good idea, Miss Madenda,&quot; said Mr. Quincel, who sat
                        at the side of the stage, looking serenely on and volunteering opinions
                        which the director did not heed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said the latter, somewhat abashed,
                        &quot;it <pb id="VAA2423-190" n="184"/> might be well to do
                        it.&quot; Then brightening, with a show of authority, &quot;Suppose
                        we run right through, putting in as much expression as we can.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good,&quot; said Mr. Quincel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This hand,&quot; resumed Mrs. Morgan, glancing tip at Mr.
                        Bamberger and down at her book, as the lines proceeded, &quot;my mother
                        grasped in her own, and so tight that a small, feeble voice uttered an
                        exclamation of pain. Mother looked down, and there beside her was a little
                        ragged girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very good,&quot; observed the director, now hopelessly
                        idle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The thief!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Bamberger.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Louder,&quot; put in the director, finding it almost impossible
                        to keep his hands off.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The thief!&quot; roared poor Bamberger.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but a thief hardly six years old, with a face like an
                        angel&apos;s. &apos;Stop,&apos; said my mother. What are you
                        doing?</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Trying to steal,&apos; said the child.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Don&apos;t you know that it is wicked to do
                        so?&apos; asked my father.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;No,&apos; said the girl, &apos;but it is dreadful
                        to be hungry.&apos;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Who told you to steal,?&apos; asked my mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Shethere,&apos; said the child, pointing to a squalid
                        woman in a doorway opposite, who fled suddenly down the street
                        &apos;That is old Judas,&apos; said the girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Morgan read this rather flatly, and the director was in despair. He
                        fidgeted around, and then went over to Mr. Quincel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you think of them?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I guess we&apos;ll be able to whip them into
                        shape,&quot; said the latter, with an air of strength under
                        difficulties. &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said the director.
                        &quot;That fellow Bamberger <pb id="VAA2423-191" n="185"/> strikes me as
                        being a pretty poor shift for a lover.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s all we&apos;ve got,&quot; said Quincel,
                        rolling up his eyes. &quot;Harrison went back on me at the last minute.
                        Who else can we get?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said the director.
                        &quot;I&apos;m afraid he&apos;ll never pick up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this moment Bamberger was exclaiming, &quot;Pearl, you are joking with
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look at that now,&quot; said the director, whispering behind
                        his hand. &quot;My Lord! what can you do with a man who drawls out a
                        sentence like that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do the best you can,&quot; said Quincel consolingly.</p>
                    <p>The rendition ran on in this wise until it came to where Carrie, as Laura,
                        comes into the room to explain to Ray, who, after hearing Pearl&apos;s
                        statement about her birth, had written the letter repudiating her, which,
                        however, he did not deliver. Bamberger was just concluding the words of Ray,
                        &quot;I must go before she returns. Her step! Too late,&quot; and
                        was cramming the letter in his pocket, when she began sweetly with:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ray!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;MissMiss Courtland,&quot; Bamberger faltered weakly.</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at him a moment and forgot all about the company present. She
                        began to feel the part, and summoned an indifferent smile to her lips,
                        turning as the lines directed and going to a window, as if he were not
                        present. She did it with a grace which was fascinating to look upon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who is that woman?&quot; asked the director, watching Carrie in
                        her little scene with Bamberger.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Madenda,&quot; said Quincel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know her name,&quot; said the director, &quot;but what
                        does she do?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-192" n="186"/>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Quincel.
                        &quot;She&apos;s a friend of one of our members.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, she&apos;s got more gumption than any one I&apos;ve
                        seen here so farseems to take an interest in what she&apos;s
                        doing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pretty, too, isn&apos;t she?&quot; said Quincel.</p>
                    <p>The director strolled away without answering.</p>
                    <p>In the second scene, where she was supposed to face the company in the
                        ball-room, she did even better, winning the smile of the director, who
                        volunteered, because of her fascination for him, to come over and speak with
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Were you ever on the stage? &quot;he asked insinuatingly.
                        &quot;No,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You do so well, I thought you might have had some
                        experience.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie only smiled consciously.</p>
                    <p>He walked away to listen to Bomberger, who was feebly spouting some ardent
                        line.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Morgan saw the drift of things and gleamed at Carrie with envious and
                        snapping black eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s some cheap professional,&quot; she gave herself
                        the satisfaction of thinking, and scorned and hated her accordingly.</p>
                    <p>The rehearsal ended for one day, and Carrie went home feeling that she had
                        acquitted herself satisfactorily. The words of the director were ringing in
                        her ears, and she longed for an opportunity to tell Hurstwood. She wanted
                        him to know just how well she was doing. Drouet, too, was an object for her
                        confidences. She could hardly wait until he should ask her, and yet she did
                        not have the vanity to bring it up. The drummer, however, had another line
                        of thought to-night, and her little experience did not appeal to him as
                        important. He let the conversation drop, save for what she chose to recite
                        without solicitation, and Carrie was not good at that. He took it for
                        granted that <pb id="VAA2423-193" n="187"/> she was doing very well and he
                        was relieved of further worry. Consequently he threw Carrie into repression,
                        which was irritating. She felt his indifference keenly and longed to see
                        Hurstwood. It was as if he were now the only friend she had on earth. The
                        next morning Drouet was interested again, but the damage had been done.</p>
                    <p>She got a pretty letter from the manager, saying that by the time she got it
                        he would be waiting for her in the park. When she came, he shone upon her as
                        the morning sun.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; he asked, &quot;how did you come
                        out?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well enough,&quot; she said, still somewhat reduced after
                        Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, tell me just what you did. Was it pleasant?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie related the incidents of the rehearsal, warming up as she
                        proceeded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s delightful,&quot; said Hurstwood.
                        &quot;I&apos;m so glad. I most get over there to see you. When is
                        the next rehearsal?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tuesday,&quot; said Carrie, &quot;but they don&apos;t
                        allow visitors.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I imagine I could get in,&quot; said Hurstwood
                        significantly.</p>
                    <p>She was completely restored and delighted by his consideration, but she made
                        him promise not to come around.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, you must do your best to please me,&quot; he said
                        encouragingly. &quot;Just remember that I want you to succeed. We will
                        make the performance worth while. You do that now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll try,&quot; said Carrie, brimming with affection
                        and enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the girl,&quot; said Hurstwood fondly.
                        &quot;Now, remember,&quot; shaking an affectionate finger at her,
                        &quot;your best.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will,&quot; she answered, looking back.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-194" n="188"/>
                    <p>The whole earth was brimming sunshine that morning. She tripped along, the
                        clear sky pouring liquid blue into her soul. Oh, blessed are the children of
                        endeavour in this, that they try and are hopeful. And blessed also are they
                        who, knowing, smile and approve.</p>

                    <p>By the evening of the 16th the subtle hand of Hurstwood had made itself
                        apparent. He had given the word among his friendsand they were many and
                        influentialthat here was something which they ought to attend, and, as a
                        consequence, the sale of tickets by Mr. Quincel, acting for the lodge, had
                        been large. Small four-line notes had appeared in all of the daily
                        newspapers. These he had arranged for by the aid of one of his newspaper
                        friends on the &quot;Times,&quot; Mr. Harry McGarren the managing
                        editor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say, Harry,&quot; Hurstwood said to him one evening, as the
                        latter stood at the bar drinking before wending his belated way homeward,
                        &quot;you can help the boys out, I guess.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it?&quot; said McGarren, pleased to be consulted by the
                        opulent manager.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Custer Lodge is getting up a little entertainment for their own
                        good, and they&apos;d like a little newspaper notice. You know what I
                        meana squib or two saying that it&apos;s going to take
                        place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said McGarren, &quot;I can fix that for
                        you, George.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At the same time Hurstwood kept himself wholly in the background. The members
                        of Custer Lodge could scarcely understand why their little affair was taking
                        so well. Mr. Harry Quincel was looked upon as quite a star for this sort of
                        work.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-196" n="190"/>
                    <p>By the time the 16th had arrived Hurstwood&apos;s friends had rallied
                        like Romans to a senator&apos;s call. A well-stressed, good-natured,
                        flatteringly-inclined audience was assured from the moment he thought of
                        assisting Carrie.</p>
                    <p>That little student had mastered her part to her own satisfaction, much as
                        she trembled for her fate when she should once face the gathered throng,
                        behind the glare of the footlights. She tried to console herself with the
                        thought that a score of other persons, men and women, were equally tremulous
                        concerning the outcome of their efforts, but she could not disassociate the
                        general danger from her own individual liability. She feared that she would
                        forget her lines, that she might be unable to master the feeling which she
                        now felt concerning her own movements in the play. At times she wished that
                        she had never gone into the affair; at others, she trembled lest she should
                        be paralysed with fear and stand white and gasping, not knowing what to say
                        and spoiling the entire performance.</p>
                    <p>In the matter of the company, Mr. Bamberger had disappeared. That hopeless
                        example had fallen under the lance of the director&apos;s criticism.
                        Mrs. Morgan was still present, but envious and determined, if for nothing
                        more than spite, to do as well as Carrie at least. A loafing professional
                        had been called in to assume the rle of Ray, and, while he was a poor stick
                        of his kind, he was not troubled by any of those qualms which attack the
                        spirit of those who have never faced an audience. He swashed about
                        (cautioned though he was to maintain silence concerning his past theatrical
                        relationships) in such a self-confident manner that he was like to convince
                        every one of his identity by mere matter of circumstantial evidence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is so easy,&quot; he said to Mrs. Morgan, in the usual
                        affected stage voice. &quot;An audience would be the last <pb
                            id="VAA2423-197" n="191"/> thing to trouble me. It&apos;s the spirit
                        of the part, you know, that is difficult.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie disliked his appearance, but she was too much the actress not to
                        swallow his qualities with complaisance, seeing that she must suffer his
                        fictitious love for the evening.</p>
                    <p>At six she was ready to go. Theatrical paraphernalia had been provided over
                        and above her care. She had practised her make-up in the morning, had
                        rehearsed and arranged her material for the evening by one o&apos;clock,
                        and had gone home to have a final look at her part, waiting for the evening
                        to come.</p>
                    <p>On this occasion the lodge sent a carriage. Drouet rode with her as far as
                        the door, and then went about the neighbouring stores, looking for some good
                        cigars. The little actress marched nervously into her dressing-room and
                        began that painfully anticipated matter of make-up which was to transform
                        her, a simple maiden, to Laura, The Belle of Society.</p>
                    <p>The flare of the gas-jets, the open trunks, suggestive of travel and display,
                        the scattered contents of the make-up boxrouge, pearl powder, whiting, burnt
                        cork, India ink, pencils for the eyelids, wigs, scissors, looking-glasses,
                        draperyin short, all the nameless paraphernalia of disguise, have a
                        remarkable atmosphere of their own. Since her arrival in the city many
                        things had influenced her, but always in a far-removed manner. This new
                        atmosphere was more friendly. It was wholly unlike the great brilliant
                        mansions which waved her coldly away, permitting her only awe and distant
                        wonder. This tools her by the hand kindly, as one who says, &quot;My
                        dear, come in.&quot; It opened for her as if for its own. She had
                        wondered at the greatness of the names upon the bill-boards, the marvel of
                        the long notices in the papers, the beauty of the dresses upon the stage,
                        the atmosphere of carriages, <pb id="VAA2423-198" n="192"/> flowers,
                        refinement. Here was no illusion. Here was an open door to see all of that.
                        She had come upon it as one who stumbles upon a secret passage, and, behold,
                        she was in the chamber of diamonds and delight!</p>
                    <p>As she dressed with a flutter, in her little stage room, hearing the voices
                        outside, seeing Mr. Quincel hurrying here and there, noting Mrs. Morgan and
                        Mrs. Hoagland at their nervous work of preparation, seeing all the twenty
                        members of the cast moving about and worrying over what the result would be,
                        she could not help thinking what a delight this would be if it would endure;
                        how perfect a state, if she could only do well now, and then some time get a
                        place as a real actress. The thought had taken a mighty hold upon her. It
                        hummed in her ears as the melody of an old song.</p>
                    <p>Outside in the little lobby another scene was being enacted. Without the
                        interest of Hurstwood, the little hall would probably have been comfortably
                        filled, for the members of the lodge were moderately interested in its
                        welfare. Hurstwood&apos;s word, however, had gone the rounds. It was to
                        be a full-dress affair. The four boxes had been taken. Dr. Norman McNeill
                        Hale and his wife were to occupy one. This was quite a card. C. R. Walker,
                        dry-goods merchant and possessor of at least two hundred thousand dollars,
                        had taken another; a well-known coal merchant had been induced to take the
                        third, and Hurstwood and his friends the fourth. Among the latter was
                        Drouct. The people who were now pouring here were not celebrities, nor even
                        local notabilities, in a general sense. They were the lights of a certain
                        circlethe circle of small fortunes and secret order distinctions. These
                        gentlemen Elks knew the standing of one another. They had regard for the
                        ability which could amass a small fortune, own a nice home, keep a barouche
                        or carriage, perhaps, wear fine clothes, and maintain a good mercantile <pb
                            id="VAA2423-199" n="193"/> position. Naturally, Hurstwood, who was a
                        little above the order of mind which accepted this standard as perfect, who
                        had shrewdness and much assumption of dignity, who held an imposing and
                        authoritative position, and commanded friendship by intuitive tact in
                        handling people, was quite a figure. He was more generally known than most
                        others in the same circle, and was looked upon as some one whose reserve
                        covered a mine of influence and solid financial prosperity.</p>
                    <p>To-night he was in his element. He came with several friends directly from
                        Rector&apos;s in a carriage. In the lobby he met Drouet, who was just
                        returning from a trip for more cigars. All five now joined in an animated
                        conversation concerning the company present and the general drift of lodge
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s here?&quot; said Hurstwood, passing into the
                        theatre proper, where the lights were turned up and a company of gentlemen
                        were laughing and talking in the open space back of the seats.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, how do you do, Mr. Hurstwood?&quot; came from the first
                        individual recognised.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Glad to see you,&quot; said the latter, grasping his hand
                        lightly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Looks quite an affair, doesn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; said the manager.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Custer seems to have the backing of its members,&quot; observed
                        the friend.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So it should,&quot; said the knowing manager.
                        &quot;I&apos;m glad to see it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, George,&quot; said another rotund citizen, whose
                        avoirdupois made necessary an almost alarming display of starched shirt
                        bosom, &quot;how goes it with you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Excellent,&quot; said the manager.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What brings you over here? You&apos;re not a member of
                        Custer.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-200" n="194"/>
                    <p>&quot;Good-nature,&quot; returned the manager. &quot;Like to see
                        the boys, you know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wife here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She couldn&apos;t come to-night. She&apos;s not
                        well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sorry to hear itnothing serious, I hope.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, just feeling a little ill.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I remember Mrs. Hurstwood when she was travelling once with you
                        over to St. Joe&quot; and here the newcomer launched off in a trivial
                        recollection, which was terminated by the arrival of more friends.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, George. how are you? &quot;said another genial West Side
                        politician and lodge member. &quot;My, but I&apos;m glad to see you
                        again; how are things, anyhow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well; I see you got that nomination for
                        alderman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Yes, we whipped them out over there without much trouble.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you suppose Hennessy will do now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he&apos;ll go back to his brick business. He has a
                        brick-yard, you know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>I didn&apos;t know that,&apos;&quot; said the manager.
                        &quot;Felt pretty sore, I suppose, over his defeat.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said the other, winking shrewdly.</p>
                    <p>Some of the more favoured of his friends whom he had invited began to roll up
                        in carriages now. They come shuffling in with a great show of finery and
                        much evident feeling of content and importance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here the are,&quot; said Hurstwood, turning to one from a group
                        with whom he was talking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; returned the newcomer, a gentleman
                        of about forty-five.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And say,&quot; he whispered, jovially, pulling Hurst-wood over
                        by the shoulder so that he might whisper in his ear, &quot;if this
                        isn&apos;t a good show, I&apos;ll punch your head.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-201" n="195"/>
                    <p>&quot;You ought to pay for seeing your old friends. Bother the
                        show!&quot;</p>
                    <p>To another who inquired, &quot;Is it something really good?&quot; the
                        manager replied:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t suppose so.&quot; Then,
                        lifting his hand graciously, &quot;For the lodge.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lots of boys out, eh?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, look up Shanahan. He was just asking for you a moment
                        ago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was thus that the little theatre resounded to a babble of successful
                        voices, the creak of fine clothes, the commonplace of good-nature, and all
                        largely because of this man&apos;s bidding. Look at him any time within
                        the half hour before the curtain was up, he was a member of an eminent
                        groupa rounded company of five or more whose stout figures, large white
                        bosoms, and shining pins bespoke the character of their success. The
                        gentlemen who brought their wives called him out to shake hands. Seats
                        clicked, ushers bowed while he looked blandly on. He was evidently a light
                        among them, reflecting in his personality the ambitions of those who greeted
                        him. He was acknowledged, fawned upon, in a way lionised. Through it all one
                        could see the standing of the man. It was greatness in a way, small as it
                        was.</p>

                    <p>At last the curtain was ready to go up. All the details of the make-up had
                        been completed, and the company settled down as the leader of the small,
                        hired orchestra tapped significantly upon his music each with his baton and
                        began the soft curtain-raising strain. Hurstwood ceased talking, and went
                        with Drouet and his friend Sagar Morrison around to the box.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, we&apos;ll see how the little girl does,&quot; he said
                        to Drouet, in a tone which no one else could hear.</p>
                    <p>On the stage, six of the characters had already appeared in the opening
                        parlour scene. Drouet and Hurst-wood saw at a glance that Carrie was not
                        among them, and went on talking in a whisper. Mrs. Morgan, Mrs. Hoagland,
                        and the actor who had taken Bamberger&apos;s part were representing the
                        principal roles in this scene. The professional, whose name was Patton, had
                        little to recommend him outside of his assurance, but this at the present
                        moment was most palpably needed. Mrs. Morgan, as Pearl, was stiff with
                        fright. Mrs. Hoagland was husky in the throat. The whole company was so
                        weak-kneed that the lines were merely spoken, and nothing more. It took all
                        the hope and uncritical good-nature of the audience to keep from manifesting
                        pity by that unrest which is the agony of failure.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was perfectly indifferent. He took it for granted that it would be
                        worthless. All he cared for was <pb id="VAA2423-203" n="197"/> to have it
                        endurable enough to allow for pretension and congratulation afterward.</p>
                    <p>After the first rush of fright, however, the players got over the danger of
                        collapse. They rambled weakly forward, losing nearly all the expression
                        which was intended, and making the thing dull in the extreme, when Carrie
                        came in.</p>
                    <p>One glance at her, and both Hurstwood and Drouet saw plainly that she also
                        was weak-kneed. She came faintly across the stage, saying:</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you, sir; we have been looking for you since eight
                        o&apos;clock,&quot; but with so little colour and in such a feeble
                        voice that it was positively painful.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s frightened,&quot; whispered Drouet to Hurstwood.
                        The manager made no answer.</p>
                    <p>She had a line presently which was supposed to be funny.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s as much as to say that I&apos;m a sort of
                        life pill.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It came out so flat, however, that it was a deathly thing. Drouet fidgeted.
                        Hurstwood moved his toe the least bit.</p>
                    <p>There was another place in which Laura was to rise and, with a sense of
                        impending disaster, say, sadly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish you hadn&apos;t said that, Pearl. You know the old
                        proverb, &apos;Calla maid by a married name.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>The lack of feeling in the thing was ridiculous. Carrie did not get it at
                        all. She seemed to be talking in her sleep. It looked as if she were certain
                        to be a wretched failure. She was more hopeless than Mrs. Morgan, who had
                        recovered somewhat, and was now saying her lines clearly at least. Drouet
                        looked away from the stage at the audience. The latter held out silently,
                        hoping for a general change, of course. Hurstwood fixed his eye on Carrie,
                        as if to hypnotise her into doing better. He was pouring determination <pb
                            id="VAA2423-204" n="198"/> of his own in her direction. He felt sorry
                        for her.</p>
                    <p>In a few more minutes it fell to her to read the letter sent in by the
                        strange villain. The audience had been slightly diverted by a conversation
                        between the professional actor and a character called Snorky, impersonated
                        by a short little American, who really developed some humour as a
                        half-crazed, one-armed soldier, turned messenger for a living. He bawled his
                        lines out with such defiance that, while they really slid not partake of the
                        humour intended, they were funny. Now he was off, however, and it was back
                        to pathos, with Carrie as the chief figure. She did not recover. She
                        wandered through the whole scene between herself and the intruding villain,
                        straining the patience of the audience, and finally exiting, much to their
                        relief.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s too nervous,&quot; said Drouet, feeling in the
                        mildness of the remark that he was lying for once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better go back and say a world to her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet was glad to do anything for relief. He fairly hustled around to the
                        side entrance, and was let in by the friendly doorkeeper. Carrie was
                        standing in the wings, weakly waiting her next cue, all the snap and nerve
                        gone out of her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say, Cad,&quot; he said, looking at her, &quot;you
                        mustn&apos;t be nervous. Wake up. Those guys out there don&apos;t
                        amount to anything. What are you afraid of?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;I just
                        don&apos;t seem to be able to do it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was grateful for the drummer&apos;s presence, though. She had found
                        the company so nervous that her own strength had gone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on,&quot; said Drouet. &quot;Brace up. What are you
                        afraid of? Go on out there now, and do the trick. What do you
                        care?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-205" n="199"/>
                    <p>Carrie revived a little under the drummer&apos;s electrical, nervous
                        condition.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did I do so very bad?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not a bit. All you need is a little more ginger. Do it as you
                        showed me. Get that toss of your head you had the other night&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie remembered her triumph in the room. She tried to think she could do
                        it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s nest?&quot; he said, looking at her part, which
                        she had been studying.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, the scene between Ray and me when I refuse him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, now you do that lively,&quot; said the drummer.
                        &quot;Put in snap, that&apos;s the thing. Act as if you
                        didn&apos;t care.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your turn nest, Miss Madenda,&quot; said the prompter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you&apos;re a chump for being afraid,&quot; said
                        Drouet. &quot;Come on now, brace up. I&apos;ll watch you from right
                        here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you? &quot;said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, now go on. Don&apos;t be afraid.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The prompter signalled her.</p>
                    <p>She started out, weak as ever, but suddenly her nerve partially returned. She
                        thought of Drouet looking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ray,&quot; she said, gently, using a tone of voice much more
                        calm than when she had last appeared. It was the scene which had pleased the
                        director at the rehearsal.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s easier,&quot; thought Hurstwood to himself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She slid not do the part as she had at rehearsal, but she was
                        better. The audience was at least not irritated. The improvement of the work
                        of the entire company tools away direct observation from her. They were
                        making very fair progress, and now it looked as if the play would be
                        passable, in the less trying parts at least.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-206" n="200"/>
                    <p>Carrie came off warm and nervous.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, looking at him, &quot;was it any
                        better?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I should say so. That&apos;s the way. Put life into it.
                        You did that about a thousand per cent. better than you did the other scene.
                        Now go on and fire up. You can do it. Knock &apos;em.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was it really better?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better, I should say so. What comes next?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That ballroom scene.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you can do that all right,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; answered Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, woman,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;you did it for me!
                        Now you go out there and do it. It&apos;ll be fun for you. Just do as
                        you did in the room. If you&apos;ll reel it off that way, I&apos;ll
                        bet you make a hit. Now, what&apos;ll you bet? You do it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The drummer usually allowed his ardent good-nature to get the better of his
                        speech. He really did think that Carrie had acted this particular scene very
                        well, and he wanted her to repeat it in public. His enthusiasm was due to
                        the mere spirit of the occasion.</p>
                    <p>When the time came, he buoyed Carrie up most effectually. He began to make
                        her feel as if she had done very well. The old melancholy of desire began to
                        come back as he talked at her, and by the time the situation rolled around
                        she was running high in feeling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I can do this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure you can. Now you go ahead and see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>On the stage, Mrs. Van Dam was malting her cruel insinuation against
                        Laura.</p>
                    <p>Carrie listened, and caught the infection of somethingshe did not know what
                        Her nostrils sniffed thinly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It means,&quot; the professional actor began, speaking as Ray,
                        &quot;that society is a terrible avenger of insult. Have you ever heard
                        of the Siberian wolves? When <pb id="VAA2423-207" n="201"/> one of the pack
                        falls through weakness, the others devour him. It is not an elegant
                        comparison, but there is something wolfish in society. Laura has mocked it
                        with a pretence, and society, which is made up of pretence, will bitterly
                        resent the mockery.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At the sound of her stage name Carrie started. She began to feel the
                        bitterness of the situation. The feelings of the outcast descended upon
                        leer. She hung at the wing&apos;s edge, wrapt in her own mounting
                        thoughts. She hardly heard anything more, save her own rumbling blood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come, girls,&quot; said Mrs. Van Dam, solemnly, &quot;let
                        us look after our things. They are no longer safe when such an accomplished
                        thief enters.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cue,&quot; said the prompter, close to her side, but she did
                        not hear. Already she was moving forward with a steady grace, born of
                        inspiration. She dawned upon the audience, handsome and proud, shifting,
                        with the necessity of the situation, to a cold, white, helpless object, as
                        the social pack moved away front her scornfully.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood blinked his eyes and caught the infection. The radiating waves of
                        feeling and sincerity were already breaking against the farthest walls of
                        the chamber. The magic of passion, which will yet dissolve the world, was
                        here at work.</p>
                    <p>There was a drawing, too, of attention, a riveting of feeling, heretofore
                        wandering.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ray! Ray! Why do you not come back to her?&quot; was the cry of
                        Pearl.</p>
                    <p>Every eye was fixed on Carrie, still proud and scornful. They moved as she
                        moved. Their eyes were with her eyes.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Morgan, as Pearl, approached her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let us go home,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; answered Carrie, her voice assuming for the <pb
                            id="VAA2423-208" n="202"/> first time a penetrating quality which it had
                        never known. &quot;Stay with him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She pointed an almost accusing hand toward her lover. Then, with a pathos
                        which struck home because of its utter simplicity, &quot;He shall not
                        suffer long.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood realised that he was seeing something extraordinarily good. It was
                        heightened for him by the applause of the audience as the curtain descended
                        and the fact that it was Carrie. He thought now that she was beautiful. She
                        had clone something which was above his sphere. He felt a keen delight in
                        realising that she was his.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fine,&quot; he said, and then, seized by a sudden impulse,
                        arose and went about to the stage door.</p>
                    <p>When he came in upon Carrie she was still with Drouet. His feelings for her
                        were most exuberant. He was almost swept away by the strength and feeling
                        she exhibited. His desire was to pour forth his praise with the unbounded
                        feelings of a lover, but here was Drouet, whose affection was also rapidly
                        reviving. The latter was more fascinated, if anything, than Hurstwood. At
                        least, in the nature of things, it took a more ruddy form.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, well,&quot; said Drouet, &quot;you did out of sight.
                        That was simply great. I knew you could do it. Oh, but you&apos;re a
                        little daisy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie&apos;s eyes flamed with the light of achievement.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did I do all right?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did yon? Well, I guess. Didn&apos;t you hear the
                        applause?&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was some faint sound of clapping yet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I got it something likeI felt it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Just then Hurstwood came in. Instinctively he felt the change in Drouet. He
                        saw that the drummer was near to Carrie, and jealousy leaped alight in his
                        bosom. In a flash of thought, he reproached himself for having <pb
                            id="VAA2423-209" n="203"/> sent him back. Also, he hated him as an
                        intruder. He could scarcely pull himself down to the level where he would
                        have to congratulate Carrie as a friend. Nevertheless, the man mastered
                        himself, and it was a triumph. He almost jerked the old subtle light to his
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought,&quot; he said, looking at Carrie, &quot;I would
                        come around and tell you how well you did, Mrs. Drouet. It was
                        delightful.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie tools the cue, and replied:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, thank you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was just telling her,&quot; put in Drouet, now delighted with
                        his possession, &quot;that I thought she did fine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed you did,&quot; said Hurstwood, turning upon Carrie eyes
                        in which she read more than the words.</p>
                    <p>Carrie laughed luxuriantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you do as well in the rest of the play, you will make us all
                        think you area born actress.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie smiled again. She felt the acuteness of Hurstwood&apos;s position,
                        and wished deeply that she could be alone with him, but she did not
                        understand the change in Drouet. Hurstwood found that he could not talk,
                        repressed as he was, and grudging Drouet every moment of his presence, he
                        bowed himself out with the elegance of a Faust. Outside he set his teeth
                        with envy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Damn it!&quot; he said, &quot;is he always going to be in
                        the way?&quot; He was moody when he got back to the box, and could not
                        talk for thinking of his wretched situation.</p>
                    <p>As the curtain for the next act arose, Drouet came back. He was very much
                        enlivened in temper and inclined to whisper, but Hurstwood pretended
                        interest. He fixed his eyes on the stage, although Carrie was not there, a
                        short bit of melodramatic comedy preceding her entrance. He did not sec what
                        was going on, however. He was thinking his own thoughts, and they were
                        wretched.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-210" n="204"/>
                    <p>The progress of the play did not improve matters for him. Carrie, front now
                        on, was easily the centre of interest. The audience, which had been inclined
                        to feel that nothing could be good after the first gloomy impression, now
                        went to the other extreme and saw power where it was not. The general
                        feeling reacted on Carrie. She presented her part with some felicity, though
                        nothing like the intensity which had aroused the feeling at the end of the
                        long first act.</p>
                    <p>Both Hurstwood and Drouet viewed her pretty figure with rising feelings. The
                        fact that such ability should reveal itself in her, that they should sec it
                        set forth under such effective circumstances, framed almost in massy gold
                        and shone upon by the appropriate lights of sentiment and personality,
                        heightened her charm for them. She was more than the old Carrie to Drouet.
                        He longed to be at home with her until he could tell her. He awaited
                        impatiently the end, when they should go home alone.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood, on the contrary, saw in the strength of her new attractiveness his
                        miserable predicament. He could have cursed the man beside him. By the Lord,
                        he could not even applaud feelingly as he would. For once he must simulate
                        when it left a taste in his mouth.</p>
                    <p>It was in the last act that Carrie&apos;s fascination for her lovers
                        assumed its most effective character.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood listened to its progress, wondering when Carrie would come on. He
                        had not long to wait. The author had used the artifice of sending all the
                        merry company for a drive, and now Carrie came in alone. It was the first
                        time that Hurstwood had had a chance to see her facing the audience quite
                        alone, for nowhere else had site been without a foil of some sort. He
                        suddenly felt, as she entered, that her old strengththe power that had
                        grasped him at the end of the first acthad come back. She <pb
                            id="VAA2423-211" n="205"/> seemed to be gaining feeling, now that the
                        play was drawing to a close and the opportunity for great action was
                        passing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Poor Pearl,&quot; she said, speaking with natural pathos.
                        &quot;It is a sad thing to want for happiness, but it is a terrible
                        thing to see another groping about blindly for it, when it is almost within
                        the grasp.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was gazing now sadly out upon the open sea, her arm resting listlessly
                        upon the polished door-post.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood began to feel a deep sympathy for her and for himself. He could
                        almost feel that she was talking to him. He was, by a combination of
                        feelings and entanglements, almost deluded by that quality of voice and
                        manner which, like a pathetic strain of music, seems ever a personal and
                        intimate thing. Pathos has this quality, that it seems ever addressed to one
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And yet, she can be very happy with him,&quot; went on the
                        little actress. &quot;Her sunny temper, her joyous face will brighten
                        any home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She turned slowly toward the audience without seeing. There was so much
                        simplicity in her movements that she seemed wholly alone. Then she found a
                        seat by a table, and turned over some books, devoting a thought to them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;With no longings for what I may not have,&quot; she breathed in
                        conclusionand it was almost a sigh&quot;my existence hidden from all
                        save two in the wide world, and making my joy out of the joy of that
                        innocent girl who will soon be his wife.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was sorry when a character, known as Peach Blossom, interrupted
                        her. He stirred irritably, for he wished her to go on. He was charmed by the
                        pale face, the lissome figure, draped in pearl grey, with a coiled string of
                        pears at the throat. Carrie had the air of one who was weary and in need of
                        protection, and, under the fascinating <pb id="VAA2423-212" n="206"/>
                        make-believe of the moment, he rose in feeling until he was ready in spirit
                        to go to her and ease her out of her misery by adding to his own
                        delight.</p>
                    <p>In a moment Carrie was alone again, and was saying, with animation:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must return to the city, no matter what dangers may lurk here. I
                        must go, secretly if I can; openly, if I must.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a sound of horses&apos; hoofs outside, and then Ray&apos;s
                        voice saying:</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I shall not ride again. Put him up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He entered, and then began a scene which had as much to do with the creation
                        of the tragedy of affection in Hurstwood as anything in his peculiar and
                        involved career. For Carrie had resolved to make something of this scene,
                        and, now that the cue had come, it began to take a feeling hold upon her.
                        Both Hurstwood and Drouet noted the rising sentiment as she proceeded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you had gone with Pearl,&quot; she said to her
                        lover.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did go part of the way, but I left the party a mile down the
                        road.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You and Pearl had no disagreement?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Noyes; that is, we always have. Our social barometers always stand
                        at &apos;cloudy&apos; and overcast.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And whose fault is that?&quot; she said, easily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not mine,&quot; he answered, pettishly. &quot;I know I do
                        all I canI say all I canbut she&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was rather awkwardly put by Patton, but Carrie redeemed it with a grace
                        which was inspiring.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But she is your wife,&quot; she said, fixing her whole
                        attention upon the stilled actor, and softening the quality of her voice
                        until it was again low and musical. &quot;Ray, my <pb id="VAA2423-213"
                            n="207"/> friend, courtship is the text from which the whole sermon of
                        married life takes its theme. Do not let yours be discontented and
                        unhappy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She put her two little hands together and pressed them appealingly.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood gazed with slightly parted lips. Drouet was fidgeting with
                        satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To be my wife, yes.&quot; went on the actor in a manner which
                        was weak by comparison, but which could not now spoil the tender atmosphere
                        which Carrie had created and maintained. She did not seem to feel that he
                        was wretched. She would have done nearly as well with a block of wood. The
                        accessories she needed were within her own imagination. The acting of others
                        could not affect them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you repent already?&quot; she said, slowly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I lost you,&quot; he said, seizing her little hand,
                        &quot;and I was at the mercy of any flirt who chose to give me an
                        inviting look. It was your faultyou know it waswhy did you leave
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie turned slowly away, and seemed to be mastering some impulse in
                        silence. Then she turned back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ray,&quot; she said, &quot;the greatest happiness I have
                        ever felt has been the thought that all your affection was forever bestowed
                        upon a virtuous woman, your equal in family, fortune, and accomplishments.
                        What a revelation do you make to me now! What is it makes you continually
                        war with your happiness?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The last question was asked so simply that it came to the audience and the
                        lover as a personal thing.</p>
                    <p>At last it came to the part where the lover exclaimed, &quot;Be to me as
                        you used to be.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie answered, with affecting sweetness, &quot;I cannot be that to you,
                        but I can speak in the spirit of the Laura who is dead to you
                        forever.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-214" n="208"/>
                    <p>&quot;Be it as you will,&quot; said Patton.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood leaned forward. The whole audience was silent and intent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let the woman you look upon be wise or vain,&quot; said Carrie,
                        her eyes bent sadly upon the lover, who had sunk into a seat,
                        &quot;beautiful or homely, rich or poor, she has but one thing she can
                        really give or refuseher heart.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet felt a scratch in his throat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Her beauty, her wit, her accomplishments, she may sell to you; but
                        her love is the treasure without money and without price.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The manager suffered this as a personal appeal. It came to him as if they
                        were alone, and he could hardly restrain the tears for sorrow over the
                        hopeless, pathetic, and yet dainty and appealing woman whom he loved. Drouet
                        also was beside himself. He was resolving that he would be to Carrie what he
                        had never been before. He would marry her, by George! She was worth it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She asks only in return,&quot; said Carrie, scarcely hearing
                        the small, scheduled reply of her lover, and putting herself even more in
                        harmony with the plaintive melody now issuing from the orchestra,
                        &quot;that when you look upon her your eyes shall speak devotion; that
                        when you address her your voice shall be gentle, loving, and kind; that you
                        shall not despise her because she cannot understand all at once your
                        vigorous thoughts and ambitious designs; for, when misfortune and evil have
                        defeated your greatest purposes, her love remains to console you. You look
                        to the trees,&quot; she continued, while Hurstwood restrained his
                        feelings only by the grimmest repression, &quot;for strength and
                        grandeur; do not despise the flowers because their fragrance is all they
                        have to give. Remember,&quot; she concluded, tenderly, &quot;love is
                        all a woman has to give,&quot; and she laid a strange, sweet accent on
                        the all, <pb id="VAA2423-215" n="209"/> &quot;but it is the only thing
                        which God permits us to carry beyond the grave.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The two men were in the most harrowed state of affection. They scarcely heard
                        the few remaining words with which the scene concluded. They only saw their
                        idol, moving about with appealing grace, continuing a power which to them
                        was a revelation.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood resolved a thousand things, Drouet as well. They joined equally in
                        the burst of applause which called Carrie out. Drouet pounded his hands
                        until they ached. Then he jumped up again and started out. As he went,
                        Carrie came out, and, seeing an immense basket of flowers being hurried down
                        the aisle toward her, she waited. They were Hurstwood&apos;s. She looked
                        toward the manager&apos;s box for a moment, caught his eye, and smiled.
                        He could have leaped out of the box to enfold her. He forgot the need of
                        circumspectness which his married state enforced. He almost forgot that he
                        had with him in the box those who knew him. By the Lord, he would have that
                        lovely girl if it took his all. He would act at once. This should be the end
                        of Drouet, and don&apos;t you forget it. He would not wait another day.
                        The drummer should not have her.</p>
                    <p>He was so excited that he could not stay in the box. He went into the lobby,
                        and then into the street, thinking. Drouet did not return. In a few minutes
                        the last act was over, and he was crazy to have Carrie alone. He cursed the
                        luck that could keep him smiling, bowing, shamming, when he wanted to tell
                        her that he loved her, when he wanted to whisper to her alone. He groaned as
                        he saw that his hopes were futile. He must even take her to supper,
                        shamming. He finally went about and asked how she was getting along. The
                        actors were all dressing, talking, hurrying about. Drouet was palavering
                        himself with the looseness of excitement and passion <pb id="VAA2423-216"
                            n="210"/> The manager mastered himself only by a great effort.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We are going to supper, of course,&quot; he said, with a voice
                        that was a mockery of his heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Carrie, smiling.</p>
                    <p>The little actress was in fine feather. She was realising now what it was to
                        be petted. For once she was the admired, the sought-for. The independence of
                        success now made its first faint showing. With the tables turned, she was
                        looking down, rather than up, to her lover. She did not fully realise that
                        this was so, but there was something in condescension coming from her which
                        was infinitely sweet. When she was ready they climbed into the waiting coach
                        and drove down town; once, only, did she find an opportunity to express her
                        feeling, and that was when the manager preceded Drouet in the coach and sat
                        beside her. Before Drouet was fully in she had squeezed Hurstwood&apos;s
                        hand in a gentle, impulsive manner. The manager was beside himself with
                        affection. He could have sold his soul to be with her alone.
                        &quot;Ah,&quot; he thought, &quot;the agony of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet hung on, thinking he was all in all. The dinner was spoiled by his
                        enthusiasm. Hurstwood went home feeling as if he should die if he did not
                        find affectionate relief. He whispered &quot;to-morrow&quot;
                        passionately to Carrie, and she understood. He walked away from the drummer
                        and his prize at parting feeling as if he could slay him and not regret.
                        Carrie also felt the misery of it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-night,&quot; he said, simulating an easy friendliness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-night,&quot; said the little actress, tenderly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The fool!&quot; he said, now hating Drouet &quot;The idiot!
                        I&apos;ll do him yet, and that quick! We&apos;ll see
                        to-morrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, if you aren&apos;t a wonder,&quot; Drouet was saying,
                        complacently, squeezing Carrie&apos;s arm. &quot;You are the
                        dandiest little girl on earth.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Passion in a man of Hurstwood&apos;s nature takes a vigorous form. It is
                        no musing, dreamy thing. There is none of the tendency to sing outside of my
                        lady&apos;s window to languish and repine in the face of difficulties.
                        In the night he was long getting to sleep because of too much thinking, and
                        in the morning he was early awake, seizing with alacrity upon the same dear
                        subject and pursuing it with vigour. He was out of sorts physically, as well
                        as disordered mentally, for did he not delight in a new manner in his
                        Carrie, and was not Drouet in the way? Never was man more harassed than he
                        by the thoughts of his love being held by the elated, flush-mannered
                        drummer. He would have given anything, it seemed to him, to have the
                        complication endedto have Carrie acquiesce to an arrangement which would
                        dispose of Drouet effectually and forever.</p>
                    <p>What to do. He dressed thinking. He moved about in the same chamber with his
                        wife, unmindful of her presence.</p>
                    <p>At breakfast he found himself without an appetite. The meat to which he
                        helped himself remained on his plate untouched. His coffee grew cold, while
                        he scanned the paper indifferently. Here and there he read a little thing,
                        but remembered nothing. Jessica had not yet come down. His wife sat at one
                        end of the table revolving thoughts of her own in silence. A new servant had
                            <pb id="VAA2423-218" n="212"/> been recently installed and had forgot
                        the napkins. On this account the silence was irritably broken by a
                        reproof.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve told you about this before, Maggie,&quot; said
                        Mrs. Hurstwood. &quot;I&apos;m not going to tell you
                        again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood took a glance at his wife. She was frowning. Just now her manner
                        irritated him excessively. Her next remark was addressed to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you made up your mind, George, when you will take your
                        vacation?&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was customary for them to discuss the regular summer outing at this season
                        of the year.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not yet,&quot; he said, &quot;I&apos;m very busy just
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you&apos;ll want to make up your mind pretty soon,
                        won&apos;t you, if we&apos;re going?&quot; she returned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess we have a few days yet,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hmff,&quot; she returned. &quot;Don&apos;t wait until
                        the season&apos;s over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She stirred in aggravation as she said this.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There you go again,&quot; he observed. &quot;One would
                        think I never did anything, the way you begin.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I want to know about it,&quot; she reiterated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve got a few days yet,&quot; he insisted.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll not want to start before the races are
                        over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was irritated to think that this should come up when he wished to have his
                        thoughts for other purposes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we may. Jessica doesn&apos;t want to stay until the end
                        of the races.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did you want with a season ticket, then?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Uh!&quot; she said, using the sound as an exclamation of
                        disgust, &quot;I&apos;ll not argue with you,&quot; and therewith
                        arose to leave the table.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say,&quot; he said, rising, putting a note of determination in
                        his voice which caused her to delay her departure. &quot;what&apos;s
                        the matter with you of late? Can&apos;t I talk with you any
                        more?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-219" n="213"/>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly, you can <hi rend="i">talk</hi> with me,&quot; she
                        replied, laying emphasis on the word.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you wouldn&apos;t think so by the way you act. Now, you
                        want to know when I&apos;ll be readynot for a month yet. Maybe not
                        then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll go without you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will, eh?&quot; he sneered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, we will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was astonished at the woman&apos;s determination, but it only
                        irritated him the more.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we&apos;ll see about that. It seems to me you&apos;re
                        trying to run things with a pretty high hand of late. You talk as though you
                        settled my affairs for me. Well, you don&apos;t. You don&apos;t
                        regulate anything that&apos;s connected with me. If you want to go, go,
                        but you won&apos;t hurry me by any such talk as that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was thoroughly aroused now. His dark eyes snapped, and he crunched his
                        paper as he laid it down. Mrs. Hurstwood said nothing more. He was just
                        finishing when she turned on her heel and went out into the hall and
                        upstairs. He paused for a moment, as if hesitating, then sat down and drank
                        a little coffee, and thereafter arose and went for his hat and gloves upon
                        the main floor.</p>
                    <p>His wife had really not anticipated a row of this character. She had come
                        down to the breakfast table feeling a little out of sorts with herself and
                        revolving a scheme which she had in her mind. Jessica had called her attion
                        to the fact that the races were not what they were supposed to be. The
                        social opportunities were not what they had thought they would be this year.
                        The beautiful girl found going every day a dull thing. There was an earlier
                        exodus this year of people who were anybody to the watering places and
                        Europe. In her own circle of acquaintances several young men in whom she was
                        interested had <pb id="VAA2423-220" n="214"/> gone to Waukesha. She began to
                        feel that she would like to go too, and her mother agreed with her.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, Mrs. Hurstwood decided to broach the subject. She was thinking
                        this over when she came down to the table, but for some reason the
                        atmosphere was wrong. She was not sure, after it was all over, just how the
                        trouble had begun. She was determined now, however, that her husband was a
                        brute, and that, under no circumstances, would she let this go by unsettled.
                        She would have more lady-like treatment or she would know why.</p>
                    <p>For his part, the manager was loaded with the care of this new argument until
                        he reached his office and started from there to meet Carrie. Then the other
                        complications of love, desire, and opposition possessed him. His thoughts
                        fled on before him upon eagles&apos; wings. He could hardly wait until
                        he should meet Carrie face to face. What was the night, after all, without
                        herwhat the day? She must and should be his.</p>
                    <p>For her part, Carrie had experienced a world of fancy and feeling since she
                        had left him, the night before. She had listened to Drouet&apos;s
                        enthusiastic maunderings with much regard for that part which concerned
                        herself, with very little for that which affected his own gain. She kept him
                        at such lengths as she could, because her thoughts were with her own
                        triumph. She felt Hurstwood&apos;s passion as a delightful background to
                        her own achievement, and she wondered what he would have to say. She was
                        sorry for him, too, with that peculiar sorrow which finds something
                        complimentary to itself in the misery of another. She was now experiencing
                        the first shades of feeling of that subtle change which removes one out of
                        the ranks of the suppliants into the lines of the dispensers of charity. She
                        was, all in all, exceedingly happy.</p>
                    <p>On the morrow, however, there was nothing in the <pb id="VAA2423-221" n="215"
                        /> papers concerning the event, and, in view of the flow of common, everyday
                        things about, it now lost a shade of the glow of the previous evening.
                        Drouet himself was not talking so much <hi rend="i">of</hi>as <hi rend="i"
                            >for</hi> her. He felt instinctively that, for some reason or other, he
                        needed reconstruction in her regard.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think,&quot; he said, as he spruced around their chambers the
                        next morning, preparatory- to going down town, &quot;that I&apos;ll
                        straighten out that little deal of mine this month and then we&apos;ll
                        get married. I was talking with Mosher about that yesterday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, you won&apos;t,&quot; said Carrie, who was coming to
                        feel a certain faint power to jest with the drummer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I will,&quot; he exclaimed, more feelingly than usual,
                        adding, with the tone of one who pleads, &quot;Don&apos;t you
                        believe what I&apos;ve told you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie laughed a little.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course I do,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>Drouet&apos;s assurance now misgave him. Shallow as was his mental
                        observation, there was that in the things which had happened which made his
                        little power of analysis useless. Carrie was still with him, but not
                        helpless and pleading. There was a lilt in her voice which was new. She did
                        not study him with eyes expressive of dependence. The drummer was feeling
                        the shadow of something which was coming. It coloured his feelings and made
                        him develop those little attentions and say those little words which were
                        mere forefendations against danger.</p>
                    <p>Shortly afterward he departed, and Carrie prepared for her meeting with
                        Hurstwood. She hurried at her toilet, which was soon made, and hastened down
                        the stairs. At the corner she passed Drouet, but they did not see each
                        other.</p>
                    <p>The drummer had forgotten some bills which he wished to turn into his house.
                        He hastened up the stairs and <pb id="VAA2423-222" n="216"/> burst into the
                        room, but found only the chambermaid, who was cleaning up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello,&quot; he exclaimed, half to himself, &quot;has
                        Carrie gone?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your wife? Yes, she went out just a few minutes ago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s strange,&quot; thought Drouet. &quot;She
                        didn&apos;t say a word to me. I wonder where she went?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He hastened about, rummaging in his valise for what he wanted, and finally
                        pocketing it. Then he turned his attention to his fair neighbour, who was
                        good-looking and kindly disposed towards him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you up to? &quot;he said, smiling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just cleaning,&quot; she replied, stopping and winding a
                        dusting towel about her hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tired of it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so very.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me show you something,&quot; he said, affably, coming over
                        and taking out of his pocket a little lithographed card which had been
                        issued by a wholesale tobacco company. On this was printed a picture of a
                        pretty girl, holding a striped parasol, the colours of which could be
                        changed by means of a revolving disk in the back, which showed red, yellow,
                        green, and blue through little interstices made in the ground occupied by
                        the umbrella top.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that clever?&quot; he said, handing it to her
                        and showing her how it worked. &quot;You never saw anything like that
                        before.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t it nice?&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can have it if you want it,&quot; he remarked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s a pretty ring you have,&quot; he said, touching
                        a commonplace setting which adorned the hand holding the card he had given
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think so?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-223" n="217"/>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; he answered, making use of a
                        pretence at examination to secure her finger. &quot;That&apos;s
                        fine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The ice being thus broken, he launched into further observation, pretending
                        to forget that her fingers were still retained by his. She soon withdrew
                        them, however, and retreated a few feet to rest against the window-sill.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t see you for a long time,&quot; she said,
                        coquettishly, repulsing one of his exuberant approaches. &quot;You most
                        have been away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was,&quot; said Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you travel far?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pretty faryes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you like it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, not very well. You get tired of it after a while.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish I could travel,&quot; said the girl, gazing idly out of
                        the window.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What has become of your friend, Mr. Hurstwood?&quot; she
                        suddenly asked, bethinking herself of the manager, who, from her own
                        observation, seemed to contain promising material.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s here in town. What makes you ask about
                        him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, nothing, only he hasn&apos;t been here since you got
                        back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did you come to know him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t I take up his name a dozen times in the last
                        month?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Get out,&quot; said the drummer, lightly. &quot;He
                        hasn&apos;t called more than half a dozen times since we&apos;ve
                        been here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He hasn&apos;t, eh?&quot; said the girl, smiling.
                        &quot;That&apos;s all you know about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet took on a slightly more serious tone. He was uncertain as to whether
                        she was joking or not.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tease,&quot; he said, &quot;what makes you smile that
                        way?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, nothing.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-224" n="218"/>
                    <p>&quot;Have you seen him recently?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not since you came back,&quot; she laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Before?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How often?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, nearly every day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was a mischievous newsmonger, and was keenly wondering what the effect of
                        her words would be.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who did he come to see?&quot; asked the drummer,
                        incredulously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mrs. Drouet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked rather foolish at this answer, and then attempted to correct
                        himself so as not to appear a dupe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;what of it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; replied the girl, her head cocked coquettishly
                        on one side.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s an old friend,&quot; he went on, getting deeper
                        into the mire.</p>
                    <p>He would have gone on further with his little flirtation, but the taste for
                        it was temporarily removed. He was quite relieved when the girl&apos;s
                        name was called from below.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve got to go,&quot; she said, moving away from him
                        airily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll see you later,&quot; he said, with a pretence of
                        disturbance at being interrupted.</p>
                    <p>When she was gone, he gave freer play to his feelings. His face, never easily
                        controlled by him, expressed all the perplexity and disturbance which he
                        felt. Could it be that Carrie had received so many visits and yet said
                        nothing about them? Was Hurstwood lying? What did the chambermaid mean by
                        it, anyway? He had thought there was something odd about Carrie&apos;s
                        manner at the time. Why did she look so disturbed when he had asked her how
                        many times Hurstwood had called? By George! <pb id="VAA2423-225" n="219"/>
                        he remembered now. There was something strange about the whole thing.</p>
                    <p>He sat down in a rocking-chair to think the better, drawing up one leg on his
                        knee and frowning mightily. His mind ran on at a great rate.</p>
                    <p>And yet Carrie hadn&apos;t acted out of the ordinary. It
                        couldn&apos;t be, by George, that she was deceiving him. She
                        hadn&apos;t acted that way. Why, even last night she had been as
                        friendly toward him as could be, and Hurstwood too. Look how they acted! He
                        could hardly believe they would try to deceive him.</p>
                    <p>His thoughts burst into words.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She did act sort of funny at times. Here she had dressed and gone
                        out this morning and never said a word.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He scratched his head and prepared to go down town. He was still frowning. As
                        he came into the hall he encountered the girl, who was now looking after
                        another chamber. She had on a white dusting cap, beneath which her chubby
                        face shone good-naturedly. Drouet almost forgot his worry in the fact that
                        she was smiling on him. His put his hand familiarly on her shoulder, as if
                        only to greet her in passing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Got over being mad?&quot; she said, still mischievously
                        inclined.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not mad,&quot; he answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you were,&quot; she said, smiling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quit your fooling about that,&quot; he said, in an offhand way.
                        &quot;Were you serious?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; she answered. Then, with an air of one who did
                        not intentionally mean to create trouble, &quot;He came lots of times. I
                        thought you knew.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The game of deception was up with Drouet. He did not try to simulate
                        indifference further.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did he spend the evenings here?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-226" n="220"/>
                    <p>&quot;Sometimes. Sometimes they went out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In the evening?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. You mustn&apos;t look so mad, though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not,&quot; he said. &quot;Did any one else see
                        him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said the girl, as if, after all, it were
                        nothing in particular.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How long ago was this?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just before you came back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The drummer pinched his lip nervously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t say anything, will you?&quot; he asked, giving
                        the girl&apos;s arm a gentle squeeze.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly not,&quot; she returned. &quot;I
                        wouldn&apos;t worry over it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; he said, passing on, seriously brooding for
                        once, and yet not wholly unconscious of the fact that he was making a most
                        excellent impression upon the chambermaid.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll see her about that,&quot; he said to himself,
                        passionately, feeling that he had been unduly wronged.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll find out, b&apos;George, whether she&apos;ll
                        act that way or not.&quot;</p>

                    <p>When Carrie came Hurstwood had been waiting many minutes. His blood was warm;
                        his nerves wrought up. He was anxious to see the woman who had stirred him
                        so profoundly the night before.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here you are,&quot; he said, repressedly, feeling a spring in
                        his limbs and an elation which was tragic in itself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>They walked on as if bound for some objective point, while Hurstwood drank in
                        the radiance of her presence. The rustle of her pretty skirt was like music
                        to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you satisfied?&quot; he asked, thinking of how well she did
                        the night before.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He tightened his fingers as he saw the smile she gave him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was wonderful.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie laughed ecstatically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That was one of the best things I&apos;ve seen in a long
                        time,&quot; he added.</p>
                    <p>He was dwelling on her attractiveness as he had felt it the evening before,
                        and mingling it with the feeling her presence inspired now.</p>
                    <p>Carrie was dwelling in the atmosphere which this man created for her. Already
                        she was enlivened and suffused with a glow. She felt his drawing toward her
                        in every sound of his voice.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-228" n="222"/>
                    <p>&quot;Those were such nice flowers you sent me,&quot; she said, after
                        a moment or two. &quot;They were beautiful.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Glad you liked them,&quot; he answered, simply.</p>
                    <p>He was thinking all the time that the subject of his desire was being
                        delayed. He was anxious to turn the talk to his own feelings. All was ripe
                        for it. His Carrie was beside him. He wanted to plunge in and expostulate
                        with her, and yet he found himself fishing for words and feeling for a
                        way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You got home all right,&quot; he said, gloomily, of a sudden,
                        his tone modifying itself to one of self-commiseration.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Carrie, easily.</p>
                    <p>He looked at her steadily for a moment, slowing his pace and fixing her with
                        his eye.</p>
                    <p>She felt the flood of feeling.</p>
                    <p>How about me?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>This confused Carrie considerably, for she realised the floodgates were open.
                        She didn&apos;t know exactly what to answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>He took his lower lip between his teeth for a moment, and then let it go. He
                        stopped by the walk side and kicked the grass with his toe. He searched her
                        face with a tender, appealing glance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you come away from him?&quot; he asked,
                        intensely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; returned Carrie, still illogically
                        drifting and finding nothing at which to catch.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact, she was in a most hopeless quandary. Here was a man whom
                        she thoroughly liked, who exercised an influence over her, sufficient almost
                        to delude her into the belief that she was possessed of a lively passion for
                        him. She was still the victim of his keen eyes, his suave manners, his fine
                        clothes. She looked and saw <pb id="VAA2423-229" n="223"/> before her a man
                        who was most gracious and sympathetic, who leaned toward her with a feeling
                        that was a delight to observe. She could not resist the glow of his
                        temperament, the light of his eye. She could hardly keep from feeling what
                        he felt.</p>
                    <p>And yet she was not without thoughts which were disturbing. What did he know?
                        What had Drouet told him? Was she a wife in his eyes, or what? Would he
                        marry her? Even while he talked, and she softened, and her eyes were lighted
                        with a tender glow, she was asking herself if Drouet had told him they were
                        not married. There was never anything at all convincing about what Drouet
                        said.</p>
                    <p>And yet she was not grieved at Hurstwood&apos;s love. No strain of
                        bitterness was in it for her, whatever he knew. He was evidently sincere.
                        His passion was real and warm. There was power in what he said. What should
                        she do? She went on thinking this, answering vaguely, languishing
                        affectionately, and altogether drifting, until she was on a borderless sea
                        of speculation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you come away?&quot; he said, tenderly.
                        &quot;I will arrange for you whatever&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, don&apos;t,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t what?&quot; he asked. &quot;What do you
                        mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a look of confusion and pain in her face. She was wondering why
                        that miserable thought must be brought in. She was struck as by a blade with
                        the miserable provision which was outside the pale of marriage.</p>
                    <p>He himself realised that it was a wretched thing to have dragged in. He
                        wanted to weigh the effects of it, and yet he could not see. He went beating
                        on, flushed by her presence, clearly awakened, intensely enlisted in his
                        plan.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you come?&quot; he said, beginning over and with
                        a more reverent feeling. &quot;You know I can&apos;t do without
                        youyou know itit can&apos;t go on this waycan it?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-230" n="224"/>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t ask if II wouldn&apos;t argue with you if I
                        could help it. Look at me, Carrie. Put yourself in my place. You
                        don&apos;t want to stay away from me, do you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head as if in deep thought.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then why not settle the whole thing, once and for
                        all?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t know! Ah, Carrie, what makes you say that?
                        Don&apos;t torment me. Be serious.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am,&quot; said Carrie, softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can&apos;t be, dearest, and say that. Not when you know how
                        I love you. Look at last night&quot;</p>
                    <p>His manner as he said this was the most quiet imaginable. His face and body
                        retained utter composure. Only his eyes moved, and they flashed a subtle,
                        dissolving fire. In them the whole intensity of the man&apos;s nature
                        was distilling itself.</p>
                    <p>Carrie made no answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How can you act this way, dearest?&quot; he inquired, after a
                        time. &quot;You love me, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned on her such a storm of feeling that she was overwhelmed. For the
                        moment all doubts were cleared away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered, frankly and tenderly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then you&apos;ll come, won&apos;t youcome
                        to-night?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie shook her head in spite of her distress.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t wait any longer,&quot; urged Hurstwood.
                        &quot;If that is too soon, come Saturday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When will we be married?&quot; she asked, diffidently,
                        forgetting in her difficult situation that she had hoped he took her to be
                        Drouet&apos;s wife.</p>
                    <p>The manager started, hit as he was by a problem which was more difficult than
                        hers. He gave no sign of the thoughts that flashed like messages to his
                        mind.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-231" n="225"/>
                    <p>&quot;Any time you say,&quot; he said, with ease, refusing to
                        discolour his present delight with this miserable problem.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Saturday?&quot; asked Carrie.</p>
                    <p>He nodded his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, if you will marry me then,&quot; she said,
                        &quot;I&apos;ll go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The manager looked at his lovely prize, so beautiful, so winsome, so
                        difficult to be won, and made strange resolutions. His passion had gotten to
                        that stage now where it was no longer coloured with reason. He did not
                        trouble over little barriers of this sort in the face of so much loveliness.
                        He would accept the situation with all its difficulties; he would not try to
                        answer the objections which cold truth thrust upon him. He would promise
                        anything, everything, and trust to fortune to disentangle him. He would make
                        a try for Paradise, whatever might be the result. He would be happy, by the
                        Lord, if it cost all honesty of statement, all abandonment of truth.</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at him tenderly. She could have laid her head upon his
                        shoulder, so delightful did it all seem.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I&apos;ll try and get ready
                        then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood looked into her pretty face, crossed with little shadows of wonder
                        and misgiving, and thought he had never seen anything more lovely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll see you again to-morrow,&quot; he said, joyously,
                        &quot;and we&apos;ll talk over the plans.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He walked on with her, elated beyond words, so delightful had been the
                        result. He impressed a long story of joy and affection upon her, though
                        there was but here and there a word. After a half-hour he began to realise
                        that the meeting come to an end, so exacting is the world.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To-morrow,&quot; he said at parting, a gayety of manner adding
                        wonderfully to his brave demeanour.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Carrie, tripping elatedly away.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-232" n="226"/>
                    <p>There had been so much enthusiasm engendered that she was believing herself
                        deeply in love. She sighed as she thought of her handsome adorer. Yes, she
                        would get ready by Saturday. She would go, and they would be happy.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE BLAZE OF THE TINDER: FLESH WARS WITH THE FLESH</head>
                    <p>The misfortune of the Hurstwood household was due to the fact that jealousy,
                        having been born of love, did not perish with it. Mrs. Hurstwood retained
                        this in such form that subsequent influences could transform it into hate.
                        Hurstwood was still worthy, in a physical sense, of the affection his wife
                        had once bestowed upon him, but in a social sense he fell short. With his
                        regard died his power to be attentive to her, and this, to a woman, is much
                        greater than outright crime toward another. Our self-love dictates our
                        appreciation of the good or evil in another. In Mrs. Hurstwood it
                        discoloured the very hue of her husband&apos;s indifferent nature. She
                        saw design in deeds and phrases which sprung only from a faded appreciation
                        of her presence.</p>
                    <p>As a consequence, she was resentful and suspicious.</p>
                    <p>The jealousy that prompted her to observe every falling away from the little
                        amenities of the married relation on his part served to give her notice of
                        the airy grace with which he still took the world. She could see from the
                        scrupulous care which he exercised in the matter of his personal appearance
                        that his interest in life had abated not a jot. Every motion, every glance
                        had something in it of the pleasure he felt in Carrie, of the zest this new
                        pursuit of pleasure lent to his days. Mrs. Hurstwood felt something,
                        sniffing change, as animals do danger, afar off.</p>
                    <p>This feeling was strengthened by actions of a direct and more potent nature
                        on the part of Hurstwood. We <pb id="VAA2423-234" n="228"/> have seen with
                        what irritation he shirked those little duties which no longer contained any
                        amusement or satisfaction for him, and the open snarls with which, more
                        recently, he resented her irritating goads. These little rows were really
                        precipitated by an atmosphere which was surcharged with dissension. That it
                        would shower, with a sky so full of blackening thunder-clouds, would
                        scarcely be thought worthy of comment. Thus, after leaving the breakfast
                        table this morning, raging inwardly at his blank declaration of indifference
                        at her plans, Mrs. Hurstwood encountered Jessica in her dressing-room, very
                        leisurely arranging her hair. Hurstwood had already left the house.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish you wouldn&apos;t be so late coming down to
                        breakfast,&quot; she said, addressing Jessica, while making for her
                        crochet basket. &quot;Now here the things are quite cold, and you
                        haven&apos;t eaten.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her natural composure was sadly ruffled, and Jessica was doomed to feel the
                        fag end of the storm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not hungry,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then why don&apos;t you say so, and let the girl put away the
                        things, instead of keeping her waiting all morning?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She doesn&apos;t mind,&quot; answered Jessica, coolly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I do, if she doesn&apos;t,&quot; returned the mother,
                        &quot;and, anyhow, I don&apos;t like you to talk that way to me.
                        You&apos;re too young to put on such an air with your
                        mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, mamma, don&apos;t row,&quot; answered Jessica.
                        &quot;What&apos;s the matter this morning, anyway?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing&apos;s the matter, and I&apos;m not rowing. You
                        mustn&apos;t think because I indulge you in some things that you can
                        keep everybody waiting. I won&apos;t have it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not keeping anybody waiting,&quot; returned
                        Jessica, sharply, stirred out of a cynical indifference to a sharp defence.
                        &quot;I said I wasn&apos;t hungry. I don&apos;t want any
                        breakfast.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-235" n="229"/>
                    <p>&quot;Mind how you address me, missy. I&apos;ll not have it. Hear me
                        now; I&apos;ll not have it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jessica heard this last while walking out of the room, with a toss of her
                        head and a flick of her pretty skirts indicative of the independence and
                        indifference she felt. She did not propose to be quarrelled with.</p>
                    <p>Such little arguments were all too frequent, the result of a growth of
                        natures which were largely independent and selfish. George, Jr., manifested
                        even greater touchiness and exaggeration in the matter of his individual
                        rights, and attempted to make all feel that he was a man with a
                        man&apos; privilegesan assumption which, of all things, is most
                        groundless and pointless in a youth of nineteen.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was a man of authority and some fine feeling, and it irritated him
                        excessively to find himself surrounded more and more by a world upon which
                        he had no hold, and of which he had a lessening understanding.</p>
                    <p>Now, when such little things, such as the proposed earlier start to Waukesha,
                        came up, they made clear to him his position. He was being made to follow,
                        was not leading. When, in addition, a sharp temper was manifested, and to
                        the process of shouldering him out of his authority was added a rousing
                        intellectual kick, such as a sneer or a cynical laugh, he was unable to keep
                        his temper. He flew into hardly repressed passion, and wished himself clear
                        of the whole household. It seemed a most irritating drag upon all his
                        desires and opportunities.</p>
                    <p>For all this, he still retained the semblance of leadership and control, even
                        though his wife was straining to revolt. Her display of temper and open
                        assertion of opposition were based upon nothing more than the feeling that
                        she could do it. She had no special evidence wherewith to justify herselfthe
                        knowledge of something which would give her both authority and excuse. The
                        latter was <pb id="VAA2423-236" n="230"/> all that was lacking, however, to
                        give a solid foundation to what, in a way, seemed groundless discontent. The
                        clear proof of one overt deed was the cold breath needed to convert the
                        lowering clouds of suspicion into a rain of wrath.</p>
                    <p>An inkling of untoward deeds on the part of Hurstwood had come. Doctor Beale,
                        the handsome resident physician of the neighbourhood, met Mrs. Hurstwood at
                        her own doorstep some days after Hurstwood and Carrie had taken the drive
                        west on Washington Boulevard. Dr. Beale, coming east on the same drive, had
                        recognised Hurstwood, but not before he was quite past him. He was not so
                        sure of Carriedid not know whether it was Hurstwood&apos;s wife or
                        daughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t speak to your friends when you meet them out
                        driving, do you?&quot; he said, jocosely, to Mrs. Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I see them, I do. Where was I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;On Washington Boulevard,&quot; he answered, expecting her eye
                        to light with immediate remembrance.</p>
                    <p>She shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, out near Hoyne Avenue. You were with your
                        husband.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess you&apos;re mistaken,&quot; she answered. Then,
                        remembering her husband&apos;s part in the affair, she immediately fell
                        a prey to a host of young suspicions, of which, however, she gave no
                        sign.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know I saw your husband,&quot; he went on. &quot;I
                        wasn&apos;t so sure about you. Perhaps it was your daughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps it was,&quot; said Mrs. Hurstwood, knowing full well
                        that such was not the case, as Jessica had been her companion for weeks. She
                        had recovered herself sufficiently to wish to know more of the details.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was it in the afternoon?&quot; she asked, artfully, assuming an
                        air of acquaintanceship with the matter.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-237" n="231"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, about two or three.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It must have been Jessica,&quot; said Mrs. Hurstwood, not
                        wishing to seem to attach any importance to the incident.</p>
                    <p>The physician had a thought or two of his own, but dismissed the matter as
                        worthy of no further discussion on his part at least.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hurstwood gave this bit of information considerable thought during the
                        next few hours, and even days. She took it for granted that the doctor had
                        really seen her husband, and that he had been riding, most likely, with some
                        other woman, after announcing himself as <hi rend="i">busy</hi> to her. As a
                        consequence, she recalled, with rising feeling, how often he had refused to
                        go to places with her, to share in little visits, or, indeed, take part in
                        any of the social amenities which furnished the diversion of her existence.
                        He had been seen at the theatre with people whom he called Moy&apos;s
                        friends; now he was seen driving, and, most likely, would have an excuse for
                        that. Perhaps there were others of whom she did not hear, or why should he
                        be so busy, so indifferent, of late? In the last six weeks he had become
                        strangely irritablestrangely satisfied to pick up and go out, whether things
                        were right or wrong in the house. Why?</p>
                    <p>She recalled, with more subtle emotions, that he did not look at her now with
                        any of the old light of satisfaction or approval in his eye. Evidently,
                        along with other things, he was taking her to be getting old and
                        uninteresting. He saw her wrinkles, perhaps. She was fading, while he was
                        still preening himself in his elegance and youth. He was still an interested
                        factor in the merry-makings of the world, while shebut she did not pursue
                        the thought. She only found the whole situation bitter, and hated him for it
                        thoroughly.</p>
                    <p>Nothing came of this incident at the time, for the truth is it did not seem
                        conclusive enough to warrant any discussion.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-238" n="232"/>
                    <p>Only the atmosphere of distrust and ill-feeling was strengthened,
                        precipitating every now and then little sprinklings of irritable
                        conversation, enlivened by flashes of wrath. The matter of the Waukesha
                        outing was merely a continuation of other things of the same nature.</p>
                    <p>The day after Carrie&apos;s appearance on the Avery stage, Mrs. Hurstwood
                        visited the races with Jessica and a youth of her acquaintance, Mr. Bart
                        Taylor, the son of the owner of a local house-furnishing establishment. They
                        had driven out early, and, as it chanced, encountered several friends of
                        Hurstwood, all Elks, and two of whom had attended the performance the
                        evening before. A thousand chances the subject of the performance had never
                        been brought up had Jessica not been so engaged by the attentions of her
                        young companion, who usurped as much time as possible. This left Mrs.
                        Hurstwood in the mood to extend the perfunctory greetings of some who knew
                        her into short conversations, and the short conversations of friends into
                        long ones. It was from one who meant but to greet her perfunctorily that
                        this interesting intelligence came.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see,&quot; said this individual, who wore sporting clothes of
                        the most attractive pattern, and had a field-glass strung over his shoulder,
                        &quot;that you did not get over to our little entertainment last
                        evening.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No?&quot; said Mrs. Hurstwood, inquiringly, and wondering why
                        he should be using the tone he did in noting the fact that she had not been
                        to something she knew nothing about. It was on her lips to say,
                        &quot;What was it?&quot; when he added, &quot;I saw your
                        husband.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her wonder was at once replaced by the more subtle quality of suspicion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, cautiously, &quot;was it pleasant? He
                        did not tell me much about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very. Really one of the best private theatricals I <pb
                            id="VAA2423-239" n="233"/> ever attended. There was one actress who
                        surprised us all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed,&quot; said Mrs. Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s too bad you couldn&apos;t have been there,
                        really. I was sorry to hear you weren&apos;t feeling well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Feeling well! Mrs. Hurstwood could have echoed the words after him
                        open-mouthed. As it was, she extricated herself from her mingled impulse to
                        deny and question, and said, almost raspingly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, it is too bad.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Looks like there will be quite a crowd here to-day,
                        doesn&apos;t it?&quot; the acquaintance observed, drifting off upon
                        another topic.</p>
                    <p>The manager&apos;s wife would have questioned farther, but she saw no
                        opportunity. She was for the moment wholly at sea, anxious to think for
                        herself, and wondering what new deception was this which caused him to give
                        out that she was ill when she was not. Another case of her company not
                        wanted, and excuses being made. She resolved to find out more.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Were you at the performance last evening?&quot; she asked of
                        the next of Hurstwood&apos;s friends who greeted her, as she sat in her
                        box.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. You didn&apos;t get around.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she answered, &quot;I was not feeling very
                        well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you rhusband told me,&quot; he answered. &quot;Well, it
                        was really very enjoyable. Turned out much better than I
                        expected.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Were there many there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The house was full. It was quite an Elk night. I saw quite a number
                        of your friendsMrs. Harrison, Mrs. Barnes, Mrs. Collins.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quite a social gathering.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed it was. My wife enjoyed it verymuch.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hurstwood bit her lip.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-240" n="234"/>
                    <p>&quot;So,&quot; she thought, &quot; that&apos;s the way he
                        does. Tells my friends I am sick and cannot come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She wondered what could induce him to go alone. There was something back of
                        this. She rummaged her brain for a reason.</p>
                    <p>By evening, when Hurstwood reached home, she had brooded herself into a state
                        of sullen desire for explanation and revenge. She wanted to know what this
                        peculiar action of his imported. She was certain there was more behind it
                        all than what she had heard, and evil curiosity mingled well with distrust
                        and the remnants of her wrath of the morning. She, impending disaster
                        itself, walked about with gathered shadow at the eyes and the rudimentary
                        muscles of savagery fixing the hard lines of her mouth.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, as we may well believe, the manager came home in the
                        sunniest mood. His conversation and agreement with Carrie had raised his
                        spirits until he was in the frame of mind of one who sings joyously. He was
                        proud of himself, proud of his success, proud of Carrie. He could have been
                        genial to all the world, and he bore no grudge against his wife. He menat to
                        be pleasant, to forget her presence, to live in the atmosphere of youth and
                        pleasure which had been restored to him.</p>
                    <p>So now, the house, to his mind, had a most pleasing and comfortable
                        appearance. In the hall he found an evening paper, laid there by the maid
                        and forgotten by Mrs. Hurstwood. In the dining-room the table was clean laid
                        with linen and napery and shiny with glasses and decorated china. Through an
                        open door he saw into the kitchen, where the fire was crackling in the stove
                        and the evening meal already well under way. Out in the small back yard was
                        George, Jr., frolicking with a young dog he had recently purchased, and in
                        the parlour Jessica was playing at the piano, the sounds of a merry waltz
                        filling every nook <pb id="VAA2423-241" n="235"/> and corner of the
                        comfortable home. Every one, like himself, seemed to have regained his good
                        spirits, to be in sympathy with youth and beauty, to be inclined to joy and
                        merry-making. He felt as if he could saya good word all around himself, and
                        took a most genial glance at the spread table and polished sideboard before
                        going upstairs to read his paper in the comfortable arm-chair of the
                        sitting-room which looked through the open windows into the street. When he
                        entered there, however, he found his wife brushing her hair and musing to
                        herself the while.</p>
                    <p>He came lightly in, thinking to smooth over any feeling that might still
                        exist by a kindly word and a ready promise, but Mrs. Hurstwood said nothing.
                        He seated himself in the large chair, stirred lightly in making himself
                        comfortable, opened his paper, and began to read. In a few moments he was
                        smiling merrily over a very comical account of a baseball game which had
                        taken place between the Chicago and Detroit teams.</p>
                    <p>The while he was doing this Mrs. Hurstwood was observing him casually though
                        the medium of the mirror which was before her. She noticed his pleasant and
                        contented manner, his airy grace and smiling humour, and it merely
                        aggravated her the more. She wondered how he could think to carry himself so
                        in her presence after the cynicism, indifference, and neglect he had
                        heretofore manifested and would continue to manifest so long as she would
                        endure it. She thought how she should like to tell himwhat stress and
                        emphasis she would lend her assertions, how she should drive over this whole
                        affair until satisfaction should be rendered her. Indeed, the shining sword
                        of her wrath was but weakly suspended by a thread of thought.</p>
                    <p>In the meanwhile Hurstwood encountered a humorous item concerning a stranger
                        who had arrived in the <pb id="VAA2423-242" n="236"/> city and became
                        entangled with a bunco-steerer. It amused him immensely, and at last he
                        stirred and chuckled to himself. He wished that he might enlist his
                        wife&apos;s attention and read it to her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ha, ha,&quot; he exclaimed softly, as if to himself,
                        &quot;that&apos;s funny.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hurstwood kept on arranging her hair, not so much as deigning a
                        glance.</p>
                    <p>He stirred again and went on to another subject. At last he felt as if his
                        good-humour must find some outlet. Julia was probably still out of humour
                        over that affair of this morning, but that could easily be straightened. As
                        a matter of fact, she was in the wrong, but he didn&apos;t care. She
                        could go to Waukesha right away if she wanted to. The sooner the better. He
                        would tell her that as soon as he got a chance, and the whole thing would
                        blow over.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you notice,&quot; he said, at last, breaking forth
                        concerning another item which he had found, &quot;that they have entered
                        suit to compel the Illinois Central to get off the lake front,
                        Julia?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>She could scarcely force herself to answer, but managed to say
                        &quot;No,&quot; sharply.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood pricked up his, ears. There was a note in her voice which vibrated
                        keenly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It would be a good thing if they did,&quot; he went on, half to
                        himself, half to her, though he felt that something was amiss in that
                        quarter. He withdrew his attention to his paper very circumspectly,
                        listening mentally for the little sounds which should show him what was on
                        foot.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact, no man as clever as Hurstwoodas observant and sensitive
                        to atmospheres of many sorts, particularly upon his own plane of
                        thoughtwould have made the mistake which he did in regard to his wife,
                        wrought up as she was, had he not been occupied mentally <pb
                            id="VAA2423-243" n="237"/> with a very different train of thought. Had
                        not the influence of Carrie&apos;s regard for bins, the elation which
                        her promise aroused in him, lasted over, he would not have seen the house in
                        so pleasant a mood. It was not extraordinarily bright and merry this
                        evening. He was merely very much mistaken, and would have been much more
                        fitted to cope with it had he come home in his normal state.</p>
                    <p>After he had studied his paper a few moments longer, he felt that he ought to
                        modify matters in some way or other. Evidently his wife was not going to
                        patch up peace at a word. So he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where did George get the dog he has there in the
                        yard?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she snapped.</p>
                    <p>He put his paper down on his knees and gazed idly out of the window. He did
                        not propose to lose his temper, but merely to be persistent and agreeable,
                        and by a few questions bring around a mild understanding of some sort.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do you feel so bad about that affair of this morning?&quot;
                        he said, at last. &quot;We needn&apos;t quarrel about that. You know
                        you can go to Waukesha if you want to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you can stay here and trifle around with some one
                        else?&quot; she exclaimed, turning to loin a determined countenance upon
                        which was drawn a sharp and wrathful sneer.</p>
                    <p>He stopped as if slapped in the face. In an instant his persuasive,
                        conciliatory manner fled. He was on the defensive at a wink and puzzled for
                        a word to reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he said at last, straightening himself
                        and gazing at the cold. determined figure before him, who paid no attention,
                        but went on arranging herself before the mirror.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know what I mean,&quot; she said, finally, as if there <pb
                            id="VAA2423-244" n="238"/> were a world of information which she held in
                        reservewhich she did not need to tell.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I don&apos;t,&quot; he said, stubbornly, yet nervous
                        and alert for what should come next. The finality of the woman&apos;s
                        manner took away his feeling of superiority in battle.</p>
                    <p>She made no answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hmph!&quot; he murmured, with a movement of his head to one
                        side. It was the weakest thing he had ever done. It was totally
                        unassured.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hurstwood noticed the lack of colour in it. She turned upon him,
                        animal-like, able to strike an effectual second blow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want the Waukesha money to-morrow morning,&quot; she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>He looked at her in amazement. Never before had he seen such a cold, steely
                        determination in her eyesuch a cruel look of indifference. She seemed a
                        thorough master of her moodthoroughly confident and determined to wrest all
                        control from him. He felt that all his resources could not defend him. He
                        must attack.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he said, jumping up. &quot;<hi
                            rend="i">You</hi>want! I&apos;d like to know what&apos;s got
                        into you to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing&apos;s <hi rend="i">got</hi> into me,&quot; she
                        said. flaming. &quot;I want that money. You can do your swaggering
                        afterwards.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Swaggering, eh! What! You&apos;ll get nothing from me. What do
                        you mean by your insinuations, anyhow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where were you last night?&quot; she answered. The words were
                        hot as they came. &quot;Who were you driving with on Washington
                        Boulevard? Who were you with at the theatre when George saw you? Do you
                        think I&apos;m a fool to be duped by you? Do you think I&apos;ll sit
                        at home here and take your &apos;too busys&apos; and
                        &apos;can&apos;t come,&apos; while you parade around and make
                        out that I&apos;m unable to come? I want you to know that lordly airs
                        have come to an end <pb id="VAA2423-245" n="239"/> so far as I am concerned.
                        You can&apos;t dictate to me nor my children. I&apos;m through with
                        you entirely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a lie,&quot; he said, driven to a corner and
                        knowing no other excuse.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lie, eh!&quot; she said, fiercely, but with returning reserve;
                        &quot;you may call it a lie if you want to, but I know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a lie, I tell you,&quot; he said, in a low, sharp
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve been searching around for some cheap accusation for
                        months, and now you think you have it. You think you&apos;ll spring
                        something and get the upper hand. Well, I tell you, you can&apos;t. As
                        long as I&apos;m in this house I&apos;m master of it, and you or any
                        one else won&apos;t dictate to medo you hear?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He crept toward her with a light in his eye that was ominous. Something in
                        the woman&apos;s cool, cynical, upper-handish manner, as if she were
                        already master, caused him to feel for the moment as if he could strangle
                        her.</p>
                    <p>She gazed at hima pythoness in humour.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not dictating to you,&quot; she returned;
                        &quot;I&apos;m telling you what I want.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The answer was so cool, so rich in bravado, that somehow it took the wind out
                        of his sails. He could not attack her, he could not ask her for proofs.
                        Somehow he felt evidence, law, the remembrance of all his property which she
                        held in her name, to be shining in her glance. He was like a vessel,
                        powerful and dangerous, but rolling and floundering without sail.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I&apos;n telling you,&quot; he said in the end,
                        slightly recovering himself, &quot;what you&apos;ll not
                        get.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll see about it,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll find out what my rights are. Perhaps you&apos;ll
                        talk to a lawyer, if you won&apos;t to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was a magnificent play, and had its effect. Hurstwood fell back beaten. He
                        knew now that he had more than mere bluff to contend with. He felt that he
                        was face <pb id="VAA2423-246" n="240"/> to face with a dull proposition.
                        What to say he hardly knew. All the merriment had gone out of the day. He
                        was disturbed, wretched, resentful. What should he do?</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do as you please,&quot; he said, at last.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll have nothing more to do with you,&quot; and out
                        he strode.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">A SPIRIT IN TRAVAIL: ONE RUNG PUT BEHIND</head>
                    <p>When Carrie reached her own room she had already fallen a prey to those
                        doubts and misgivings which are ever the result of a lack of decision She
                        could not persuade herself as to the advisability of her promise, or that
                        now, having given her word, site ought to keep it. She went over the whole
                        ground in Hurstwood&apos;s absence, and discovered little objections
                        that had not occurred to her in the warmth of the manager&apos;s
                        argument. She saw where she had put herself in a peculiar light, mutely,
                        that of agreeing to marry when site was already supposedly married. She
                        remembered a few things Drouet had done, and now that it came to walking
                        away from hits without a word, she felt as if she were doing wrong. Now, she
                        was comfortably situated, and to one who is more or less afraid of the
                        world, this is an urgent matter, and one which puts up strange, uncanny
                        arguments. &quot;You do not know what will come. There are miserable
                        things outside. People go a-begging. Women are wretched. You never can tell
                        what will happen. Remember the time you were hungry. Stick to what you
                        have.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Curiously, for all her leaning towards Hurstwood, he had not taken a firm
                        hold on her understanding. She was listening, smiling, approving, and yet
                        not finally agreeing. This was clue to a lack of power on his part, a lack
                        of that majesty of passion that sweeps the mind from its seat, fuses and
                        melts all arguments and theories into a tangled mass, and destroys for the
                        time being the reasoning <pb id="VAA2423-248" n="242"/> power. This majesty
                        of passion is possessed by nearly every man once in his life, but it is
                        usually an attribute of youth and conduces to the first successful
                        mating.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood, being an older man, could scarcely be said to retain the fire of
                        youth, though he did possess a passion warm and unreasoning. It was strong
                        enough to induce the leaning toward him which, on Carrie&apos;s part, we
                        have seen. She might have been said to be imagining herself in love, when
                        she was not. Women frequently do this. It flows from the fact that in each
                        exists a bias toward affection, a craving for the pleasure of being loved.
                        The longing to be shielded, bettered, sympathised with, is one of the
                        attributes of the sex. This, coupled with sentiment and a natural tendency
                        to emotion, often makes refusing difficult. It persuades them that they are
                        in love.</p>
                    <p>Once at some, she changed her clothes and straightened the rooms for herself.
                        In the matter of the arrangement of the furniture she never tools the
                        house-maid&apos;s opinion. That young woman invariably put one of the
                        rocking-chairs in the corner, and Carrie as regularly moved it out. To-day
                        she hardly noticed that it was in the wrong place, so absorbed was she in
                        her own thoughts. She worked about the room until Drouet put in appearance
                        at five o&apos;clock. The drummer was flushed and excited and full of
                        determination to know all about her relations with Hurstwood. Nevertheless,
                        after going over the subject in his mind the livelong day, he was rather
                        weary of it and wished it over with. He did not foresee serious consequences
                        of any sort, and yet he rather hesitated to begin. Carrie was sitting by the
                        window when he carne in, rocking and looking out.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said innocently, weary of her own mental
                        discussion and wondering at his haste and ill-concealed excitement,
                        &quot;what makes you hurry so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet hesitated, now that he was in her presence, uncertain <pb
                            id="VAA2423-249" n="243"/> as to what course to pursue. He was no
                        diplomat. He could neither read nor see.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When did you get home?&quot; he asked foolishly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, an hour or so ago. What makes you ask that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You weren&apos;t here,&quot; he said, &quot;when I came
                        back this morning, and I thought you had gone out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So I did,&quot; said Carrie simply. &quot;I went for a
                        walk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet looked at her wonderingly. For all his lack of dignity in such matters
                        he did not know how to begin. He stared at her in the most flagrant manner
                        until at last she said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What makes you stare at me so? What&apos;s the
                        matter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; he answered. &quot;I was just
                        thinking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just thinking what?&quot; she returned smilingly, puzzled by
                        his attitude.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, nothingnothing much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, what makes you look so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet was standing by the dresser, gazing at her in a comic manner. He had
                        laid off his hat and gloves and was now fidgeting with the little toilet
                        pieces which were nearest him. He hesitated to believe that the pretty woman
                        before him was involved in anything so unsatisfactory to himself. He was
                        very much inclined to feel that it was all right, after all. Yet the
                        knowledge imparted to him by the chambermaid was rankling in his mind. He
                        wanted to plunge in with a straight remark of some sort, but he knew not
                        what.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where did you go this morning?&quot; he finally asked
                        weakly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, I went for a walk,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure you did?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, what makes you ask?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was beginning to see now that he knew something. Instantly she drew
                        herself into a more reserved position. Her cheeks blanched slightly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-250" n="244"/>
                    <p>&quot;I thought maybe you didn&apos;t,&quot; he said, beating
                        about the bush in the most useless manner.</p>
                    <p>Carrie gazed at him, and as she did so her ebbing courage halted. She saw
                        that he himself was hesitating, and with a woman&apos;s intuition
                        realised that there was no occasion for great alarm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What makes you talk like that?&quot; she asked, wrinkling her
                        pretty forehead. &quot;You act no funny to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I feel funny,&quot; he answered.</p>
                    <p>They looked at one another for a moment, and then Drouet plunged desperately
                        into his subject.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s this about you and Hurstwood?&quot; he
                        asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Me and Hurstwoodwhat do you mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t he come here a dozen times while I was
                        away?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A dozen times,&quot; repeated Carrie, guiltily. &quot;No,
                        but what do you mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Somebody said that you went out riding with him and that he came
                        here every night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No such thing,&quot; answered Carrie. &quot;It
                        isn&apos;t true. Who told you that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was flushing scarlet to the roots of her hair, but Drouet did not catch
                        the full hue of her face, owing to the modified light of the room. He was
                        regaining much confidence as Carrie defended herself with denials.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, some one,&quot; he said. &quot;You&apos;re sure
                        you didn&apos;t?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;You know how often he
                        came.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet paused for a moment and thought.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know what you told me,&quot; he said finally.</p>
                    <p>He moved nervously about, while Carrie looked at him confusedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I know that I didn&apos;t tell you any such thing as
                        that,&quot; said Carrie, recovering herself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I were you,&quot; went on Drouet, ignoring her last <pb
                            id="VAA2423-251" n="245"/> remark, &quot;I wouldn&apos;t have
                        anything to do with him. He&apos;s a married man, you
                        know&quot;.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whowho is?&quot; said Carrie, stumbling at the word.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Hurstwood,&quot; said Drouet, noting the effect and
                        feeling that he was delivering a telling blow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hurstwood!&quot; exclaimed Carrie, rising. Her face had changed
                        several shades since this announcement was made. She looked within and
                        without herself in a half-dazed way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who told you this?&quot; she asked, forgetting that her
                        interest was out of order and exceedingly incriminating.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, I know it. I&apos;ve always known it,&quot; said
                        Drouet.</p>
                    <p>Carrie was feeling about for a right thought. She was making a most miserable
                        showing, and yet feelings were generating within her which were anything but
                        crumbling cowardice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I told you,&quot; he added.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, you didn&apos;t,&quot; she contradicted, suddenly
                        recovering her voice. &quot;You didn&apos;t do anything of the
                        kind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet listened to her in astonishment. This was something new.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I did,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked around her very solemnly, and then went over to the window.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You oughtn&apos;t to have had anything to do with
                        him,&quot; said Drouet in an injured tone, &quot;after all
                        I&apos;ve done for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You,&quot; said Carrie, &quot;you! What have you done for
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her little brain had been surging with contradictory feelingsshame at
                        exposure, shame at Hurstwood&apos;s perfidy, anger at Drouet&apos;s
                        deception, the mockery he had made of her. Now one clear idea came into her
                        head. He was at fault. There was no doubt about it. Why did he bring
                        Hurstwood outHurstwood, a married <pb id="VAA2423-252" n="246"/> man, and
                        never say a word to her? Never mind now about Hurstwood&apos;s
                        perfidywhy had he done this? Why hadn&apos;t he warned her? There he
                        stood now, guilty of this miserable breach of confidence and talking about
                        what he had done for her!</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I like that,&quot; exclaimed Drouet, little realising the
                        fire his remark had generated. &quot;I think I&apos;ve done a good
                        deal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have, eh? &quot;she answered. &quot;You&apos;ve
                        deceived methat&apos;s what you&apos;ve done. You&apos;ve
                        brought your old friends out here under false pretences. You&apos;ve
                        made me out to be Oh,&quot; and with this her voice broke and she
                        pressed her two little hands together tragically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see what that&apos;s got to do with
                        it,&quot; said the drummer quaintly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she answered, recovering herself and shutting her
                        teeth. &quot;No, of course you don&apos;t see. There isn&apos;t
                        anything you see. You couldn&apos;t have told me in the first place,
                        could you? You had to make me out wrong until it was too late. Now you come
                        sneaking around with your information and your talk about what you have
                        done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet had never suspected this side of Carrie&apos;s nature. She was
                        alive with feeling, her eyes snapping, her lips quivering, her whole body
                        sensible of the injury she felt, and partaking of her wrath.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s sneaking?&quot; he asked, mildly conscious of
                        error on his part, but certain that he was wronged.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are,&quot; stamped Carrie. &quot;You&apos;re a
                        horrid, conceited coward, that&apos;s what you are. If you had any sense
                        of manhood in you, you wouldn&apos;t have thought of doing any such
                        thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The drummer stared.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not a coward,&quot; he said. &quot;What do you
                        mean by going with other men, anyway?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-253" n="247"/>
                    <p>&quot;Other men!&quot; exclaimed Carrie. &quot;Other menyou know
                        better than that. I did go with Mr. Hurstwood, but whose fault was it?
                        Didn&apos;t you bring him here? You told him yourself that he should
                        come out here and take me out. Now, after it&apos;s all over, you come
                        and tell me that I oughtn&apos;t to go with him and that he&apos;s a
                        married MAN.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She paused at the sound of the last two words and wrung her hands. The
                        knowledge of Hurstwood&apos;s perfidy wounded her like a knife.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she sobbed, repressing herself wonderfully and
                        keeping her eyes dry. &quot;Oh, oh!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I didn&apos;t think you&apos;d be running around with
                        him when I was away,&quot; insisted Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t think!&quot; said Carrie, now angered to the
                        core by the man&apos;s peculiar attitude. &quot;Of course not. You
                        thought only of what would be to your satisfaction. You thought
                        you&apos;d make a toy of mea plaything. Well, I&apos;ll show you
                        that you won&apos;t. I&apos;ll have nothing more to do with you at
                        all. You can take your old things and keep them,&quot; and unfastening a
                        little pin he had given her, she flung it vigorously upon the floor and
                        began to move about as if to gather up the things which belonged to her.</p>
                    <p>By this Drouet was not only irritated but fascinated the more. He looked at
                        her in amazement, and finally said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see where your wrath comes in. I&apos;ve got
                        the right of this thing. You oughtn&apos;t to have done anything that
                        wasn&apos;t right after all I did for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What have you done for me?&quot; asked Carrie blazing, her head
                        thrown back and her lips parted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I&apos;ve done a good deal,&quot; said the drummer,
                        looking around. &quot;I&apos;ve given you all the clothes you
                        wanted, haven&apos;t I? I&apos;ve taken you everywhere you wanted to
                        go. You&apos;ve had as much as I&apos;ve had, and more
                        too.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-254" n="248"/>
                    <p>Carrie was not ungrateful, whatever else might be said of her. In so far as
                        her mind could construe, she acknowledged benefits received. She hardly knew
                        how to answer this, and yet her wrath was not placated. She felt that the
                        drummer had injured her irreparably.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did I ask you to?&quot; she returned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I did it,&quot; said Drouet, &quot;and you took
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You talk as though I had persuaded you,&quot; answered Carrie.
                        &quot;You stand there and throw up what you&apos;ve done. I
                        don&apos;t want your old things. I&apos;ll not have them. You take
                        them to-night and do what you please with them. I&apos;ll not stay here
                        another minute.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s nice!&quot; he answered, becoming angered now
                        at the sense of his own approaching loss. &quot;Use every-thing and
                        abuse me and then walk off. That&apos;s just like a woman. I take you
                        when you haven&apos;t got anything, and then when some one else comes
                        along, why I&apos;m no good. I always thought it&apos;d come out
                        that way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He felt really hurt as he thought of his treatment, and looked as if he saw
                        no way of obtaining justice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s not so,&quot; said Carrie, &quot;and
                        I&apos;m not going with anybody else. You have been as miserable and
                        inconsiderate as you can be. I hate you, I tell you, and I wouldn&apos;t
                        live with you another minute. You&apos;re a big, insulting&quot;here
                        she hesitated and used no word at all&quot;or you wouldn&apos;t talk
                        that way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had secured her hat and jacket and slipped the latter on over her little
                        evening dress. Some wisps of wavy hair had loosened from the bands at the
                        side of her head and were straggling over her hot, red cheeks. She was
                        angry, mortified, grief-stricken. Her large eyes were full of the anguish of
                        tears, but her lids were not yet wet. She was distracted and uncertain,
                        deciding and doing things without an aim or conclusion, and she had not the
                        slightest conception of how the whole difficulty would end.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-255" n="249"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s a fine finish,&quot; said Drouet.
                        &quot;Pack up and pull out, eh? You take the cake. I bet you were
                        knocking around with Hurstwood or you wouldn&apos;t act like that. I
                        don&apos;t want the old rooms. You needn&apos;t pull out for me. You
                        can have them for all I care, but b&apos;George, you haven&apos;t
                        done me right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not live with you,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t want to live with you. You&apos;ve done nothing but brag
                        around ever since you&apos;ve been here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw, I haven&apos;t anything of the kind,&quot; he
                        answered.</p>
                    <p>Carrie walked over to the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot; he said, stepping over and heading
                        her off.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me out,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot; he repeated.</p>
                    <p>He was, above all, sympathetic, and the sight of Carrie wandering out, he
                        knew not where, affected him, despite his grievance.</p>
                    <p>Carrie merely pulled at the door.</p>
                    <p>The strain of the situation was too much for her, however. She made one more
                        vain effort and then burst into tears.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, be reasonable, Cad,&quot; said Drouet gently.
                        &quot;What do you want to rush out for this way? You haven&apos;t
                        any place to go. Why not stay here now and be quiet? I&apos;ll not
                        bother you. I don&apos;t want to stay here any longer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie had gone sobbing from the door to the window. She was so overcome she
                        could not speak.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be reasonable now,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t
                        want to hold you. You can go if you want to, but why don&apos;t you
                        think it over? Lord knows, I don&apos;t want to stop you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He received no answer. Carrie was quieting, however, under the influence of
                        his plea.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You stay here now, and I&apos;ll go,&quot; he added at
                        last.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-256" n="250"/>
                    <p>Carrie listened to this with mingled feelings. Her mind was shaken loose from
                        the little mooring of logic that it had. She was stirred by this thought,
                        angered by thather own injustice, Hurstwood&apos;s, Drouet&apos;s,
                        their respective qualities of kindness and favour, the threat of the world
                        outside, in which she had failed once before, the impossibility of this
                        state inside, where the chambers were no longer justly hers, the effect of
                        the argument upon her nerves, all combined to make her a mass of jangling
                        fibresan anchorless, storm-beaten little craft which could do absolutely
                        nothing but drift.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say,&quot; said Drouet, coming over to her after a few moments,
                        with a new idea, and putting his hand upon her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t!&quot; said Carrie, drawing away, but not
                        removing her handkerchief from her eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind about this quarrel now. Let it go. You stay here until
                        the month&apos;s out, anyhow, and then you can tell better what you want
                        to do. Eh?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie made no answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d better do that,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;There&apos;s no use your packing up now. You can&apos;t go
                        anywhere.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Still he got nothing for his words.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you&apos;ll do that, we&apos;ll call it off for the
                        present and I&apos;ll get out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie lowered her handkerchief slightly and looked out of the window.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you do that?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>Still no answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you?&quot; he repeated.</p>
                    <p>She only looked vaguely into the street.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw! come on,&quot; he said, &quot;tell me. Will
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Carrie softly, forced to
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Promise me you&apos;ll do that,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;and we&apos;ll quit talking about it. It&apos;ll be the
                        best thing for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie heard him, but she could not bring herself to <pb id="VAA2423-257"
                            n="251"/> answer reasonably. She felt that the man was gentle, and that
                        his interest in her had not abated, and it made her suffer a pang of regret.
                        She was in a most helpless plight.</p>
                    <p>As for Drouet, his attitude had been that of the jealous lover. Now his
                        feelings were a mixture of anger at deception, sorrow at losing Carrie,
                        misery at being defeated. He wanted his rights in some way or other, and yet
                        his rights included the retaining of Carrie, the making her feel her
                        error.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you?&quot; he urged.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll see,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>This left the matter as open as before, but it was something. It looked as if
                        the quarrel would blow over, if they could only get some way of talking to
                        one another. Carrie was ashamed, and Drouet aggrieved. He pretended to take
                        up the task of packing some things in a valise.</p>
                    <p>Now, as Carrie watched him out of the corner of her eye, certain sound
                        thoughts came into her head. He had erred, true, but what had she done? He
                        was kindly and good-natured for all his egotism. Throughout this argument he
                        had said nothing very harsh. On the other hand, there was Hurstwooda greater
                        deceiver than he. He had pretended all this affection, all this passion, and
                        he was lying to her all the while. Oh, the perfidy of men! And she had loved
                        him. There could be nothing more in that quarter. She would see Hurstwood no
                        more. She would write him and let him know what she thought. There-upon what
                        would she do? Here were these rooms. Here was Drouet, pleading for her to
                        remain. Evidently things could go on here somewhat as before, if all were
                        arranged. It would be better than the street, without a place to lay her
                        head.</p>
                    <p>All this she thought of as Drouet rummaged the drawers for collars and
                        laboured long and painstakingly at finding a shirt-stud. He was in no hurry
                        to rush this matter.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-258" n="252"/>
                    <p>He felt an attraction to Carrie which would not down. He could not think that
                        the thing would end by his walking out of the room. There must be some way
                        round, some way to make her own up that he was right and she was wrongto
                        patch up a peace and shut out Hurstwood for ever. Mercy, how he turned at
                        the man&apos;s shameless duplicity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think,&quot; he said, after a few moments&apos;
                        silence, &quot;that you&apos;ll try and get on the
                        stage?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was wondering what she was intending.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know what I&apos;ll do yet,&quot; said
                        Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you do, maybe I can help you. I&apos;ve got a lot of friends
                        in that line.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She made no answer to this.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t go and try to knock around now without any money.
                        Let me help you,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s no easy thing to
                        go on your own hook here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie only rocked back and forth in her chair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want you to go up against a hard game that
                        way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He bestirred himself about some other details and Carrie rocked on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you tell me all about this thing,&quot; he
                        said, after a time, &quot;and let&apos;s call it off? You
                        don&apos;t really care for Hurstwood, do you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do you want to start on that again?&quot; said Carrie.
                        &quot;You were to blame.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I wasn&apos;t,&quot; he answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you were, too,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;You
                        shouldn&apos;t have ever told me such a story as that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you didn&apos;t have much to do with him, did
                        you?&quot; went on Drouet, anxious for his own peace of mind to get some
                        direct denial from her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t talk about it,&quot; said Carrie, pained at
                        the quizzical turn the peace arrangement had taken.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-259" n="253"/>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the use of acting like that now, Cad?&quot;
                        insisted the drummer, stopping in his work and putting up a hand
                        expressively. &quot;You might let me know where I stand, at
                        least.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t,&quot; said Carrie, feeling no refuge but in
                        anger. &quot;Whatever has happened is your own fault.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you do care for him?&quot; said Drouet, stopping
                        completely and experiencing a rush of feeling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, stop!&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll not be made a fool of,&quot; exclaimed
                        Drouet. &quot;You may trifle around with him if you want to, but you
                        can&apos;t lead me. You can tell me or not, just as you want to, but I
                        won&apos;t fool any longer!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shoved the last few remaining things he had laid out into his valise and
                        snapped it with a vengeance. Then he grabbed his coat, which he had laid off
                        to work, picked up his gloves, and started out.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can go to the deuce as far as I am concerned.&quot; he
                        said, as he reached the door. &quot;I&apos;m no sucker,&quot;
                        and with that he opened it with a jerk and closed it equally vigorously.</p>
                    <p>Carrie listened at her window view, more astonished than anything else at
                        this sudden rise of passion in the drummer. She could hardly believe her
                        sensesso good-natured and tractable had he invariably been. It was not for
                        her to see the wellspring of human passion. A real flame of love is a subtle
                        thing. It burns as a will-o&apos;-the-wisp, dancing onward to fairylands
                        of delight. It roars as a furnace. Too often jealousy is the quality upon
                        which it feeds.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">ASHES OF TINDER: A FACE AT THE WINDOW</head>
                    <p>That night Hurstwood remained down town entirely, going to the Palmer House
                        for a bed after his work was through. He was in a fevered state of mind,
                        owing to the blight his wife&apos;s action threatened to cast upon his
                        entire future. While he was not sure how much significance might be attached
                        to the threat she had made, he was sure that her attitude, if long
                        continued, would cause him no end of trouble. She was determined, and had
                        worsted him in a very important contest. How would it be from now on? He
                        walked the floor of his little office, and later that of his room, putting
                        one thing and another together to no avail.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hurstwood, on the contrary, had decided not to lose her advantage by
                        inaction. Now that she had practically cowed him, she would follow up her
                        work with demands, the acknowledgment of which would make her word <hi
                            rend="i">law</hi> in the future. He would have to pay her the money
                        which she would now regularly demand or there would be trouble. It did not
                        matter what he did. She really did not care whether he came home any more or
                        not. The household would move along much more pleasantly without him, and
                        she could do as she wished without consulting any one. Now she proposed to
                        consult a lawyer and hire a detective. She would find out at once just what
                        advantages she could gain.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood walked the floor, mentally arranging the chief points of his
                        situation. &quot;She has that property in <pb id="VAA2423-261" n="255"/>
                        her name,&quot; he kept saying to himself. &quot;What a fool trick
                        that was. Curse it! What a fool move that was.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He also thought of his managerial position. &quot;If she raises a row now
                        I&apos;ll lose this thing. They won&apos;t have me around if my name
                        gets in the papers. My friends, too!&quot; He grew more angry as he
                        thought of the talk any action on her part would create. How would the
                        papers talk about it? Every man he knew would be wondering. He would have to
                        explain and deny and make a general mark of himself. Then Moy would come and
                        confer with him and there would be the devil to pay.</p>
                    <p>Many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplated this, and
                        his brow moistened. He saw no solution of anythingnot a loophole left.</p>
                    <p>Through all this thoughts of Carrie flashed upon him, and the approaching
                        affair of Saturday. Tangled as all his matters were, he did not worry over
                        that. It was the one pleasing thing in this whole rout of trouble. He could
                        arrange that satisfactorily, for Carrie would be glad to wait, if necessary.
                        He would see how things turned out to-morrow, and then he would talk to her.
                        They were going to meet as usual. He saw only her pretty face and neat
                        figure and wondered why life was not arranged so that such joy as he found
                        with her could be steadily maintained. How much more pleasant it would be.
                        Then he would take up his wife&apos;s threat again, and the wrinkles and
                        moisture would return.</p>
                    <p>In the morning he came over from the hotel and opened his mail, but there was
                        nothing in it outside the ordinary run. For some reason he felt as it
                        something might come that way, and was relieved when all the envelopes had
                        been scanned and nothing suspicious noticed. He began to feel the appetite
                        that had been wanting before he had reached the office, and decided before
                        going out to the park to meet Carrie to drop in at the Grand Pacific and <pb
                            id="VAA2423-262" n="256"/> have a pot of coffee and some rolls. While
                        the danger had not lessened, it had not as yet materialised, and with him no
                        news was good news. If he could only get plenty of time to think, perhaps
                        something would turn up. Surely, surely, this thing would not drift along to
                        catastrophe and he not find a way out.</p>
                    <p>His spirits fell, however, when, upon reaching the park, he waited and waited
                        and Carrie did not come. He held his favourite post for an hour or more,
                        then arose and began to walk about restlessly. Could something have happened
                        out there to keep her away? Could she have been reached by his wife? Surely
                        not. So little did he consider Drouet that it never once occurred to him to
                        worry about his finding out. He grew restless as he ruminated, and then
                        decided that perhaps it was nothing. She had not been able to get away this
                        morning. That was why no letter notifying him had come. He would get one
                        today. It would probably be on his desk when he got back. He would look for
                        it at once.</p>
                    <p>After a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the Madison car. To
                        add to his distress, the bright blue sky became overcast with little fleecy
                        clouds which shut out the sun. The wind veered to the east, and by the time
                        he reached his office it was threatening to drizzle all afternoon.</p>
                    <p>He went in and examined his letters, but there was nothing from Carrie.
                        Fortunately, there was nothing from his wife either. He thanked his stars
                        that he did not have to confront that proposition just now when he needed to
                        think so much. He walked the floor again, pretending to be in an ordinary
                        mood, but secretly troubled beyond the expression of words.</p>
                    <p>At one-thirty he went to Rector&apos;s for lunch, and when he returned a
                        messenger was waiting for him. He looked at the little chap with a feeling
                        of doubt.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-263" n="257"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m to bring an answer,&quot; said the boy.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood recognised his wife&apos;s writing. He tore it open and read
                        without a show of feeling. It began in the most formal manner and was
                        sharply and coldly worded throughout.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want you to send the money I asked for at once. I need it to
                        carry out my plans. You can stay away if you want to. It doesn&apos;t
                        matter in the least. But I must have some money. So don&apos;t delay,
                        but send it by the boy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When he had finished it, he stood holding it in his hands. The audacity of
                        the thing took his breath. It roused his ire alsothe deepest element of
                        revolt in him. His first impulse was to write but four words in
                        reply&quot;Go to the devil!&quot;but he compromised by telling the
                        boy that there would be no reply. Then he sat down in his chair and gazed
                        without seeing, contemplating the result of his work. What would she do
                        about that? The confounded wretch! Was she going to try to bulldoze him into
                        submission? He would go up there and have it out with her, that&apos;s
                        what he would do. She was carrying things with too high a hand. These were
                        his first thoughts.</p>
                    <p>Later, however, his old discretion asserted itself. Something had to be done.
                        A climax was near and she would not sit idle. He knew her well enough to
                        know that when she had decided upon a plan she would follow it up. Possibly
                        matters would go into a lawyer&apos;s hands at once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Damn her!&quot; he said softly, with his teeth firmly set,
                        &quot;I&apos;ll make it hot for her if she causes me trouble.
                        I&apos;ll make her change her tone if I have to use force to do
                        it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street. The long
                        drizzle had begun. Pedestrians had turned up collars, and trousers at the
                        bottom. Hands <pb id="VAA2423-264" n="258"/> were hidden in the pockets of
                        the umbrellaless; umbrellas were up. The street looked like a sea of round
                        black cloth roofs, twisting, bobbing, moving. Trucks and vans were rattling
                        in a noisy line and everywhere men were shielding themselves as best they
                        could. He scarcely noticed the picture. He was forever confronting his wife,
                        demanding of her to change her attitude toward him before he worked her
                        bodily harm.</p>
                    <p>At four o&apos;clock another note came, which simply said that if the
                        money was not forthcoming that evening the matter would be laid before
                        Fitzgerald and Moy on the morrow, and other steps would be taken to get
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood almost exclaimed out loud at the insistency of this thing. Yes, he
                        would send her the money. He&apos;d take it to herhe would go up there
                        and have a talk with her, and that at once.</p>
                    <p>He put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella. He would have some
                        arrangement of this thing.</p>
                    <p>He called a cab and was driven through the dreary rain to the North Side. On
                        the way his temper cooled as he thought of the details of the case. What did
                        she know? What had she done? Maybe she&apos;d got hold of Carrie, who
                        knowsoror Drouet. Perhaps she really had evidence, and was prepared to fell
                        him as a man does another from secret ambush. She was shrewd. Why should she
                        taunt him this way unless she had good grounds?</p>
                    <p>He began to wish that he had compromised in some way or otherthat he had sent
                        the money. Perhaps he could do it up here. He would go in and see, anyhow.
                        He would have no row.</p>
                    <p>By the time he reached his own street he was keenly alive to the difficulties
                        of his situation and wished over and over that some solution would offer
                        itself, that he could see his way out. He alighted and went up the steps to
                            <pb id="VAA2423-265" n="259"/> the front door, but it was with a nervous
                        palpitation of the heart. He pulled out his key and tried to insert it, but
                        another key was on the inside. He shook at the knob, but the door was
                        locked. Then he rang the bell. No answer. He rang againthis time harder.
                        Still no answer. He jangled it fiercely several times in succession, but
                        without avail. Then he went below.</p>
                    <p>There was a door which opened under the steps into the kitchen, protected by
                        an iron grating, intended as a safeguard against burglars. When he reached
                        this he noticed that it also was bolted and that the kitchen windows were
                        down. What could it mean? He rang the bell and then waited. Finally, seeing
                        that no one was coming, he turned and went back to his cab.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess they&apos;ve gone out,&quot; he said apologetically
                        to the individual who was hiding his red face in a loose tarpaulin
                        rain-coat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw a young girl up in that winder,&quot; returned the
                        cabby.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood looked, but there was no face there now. He climbed moodily into
                        the cab, relieved and distressed.</p>
                    <p>So this was the game, was it? Shut him out and make him pay. Well, by the
                        Lord, that did beat all!</p>

                    <p>When Hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greater quandary than
                        ever. Lord, Lord, he thought, what had he got into? How could things have
                        taken such a violent turn, and so quickly? He could hardly realize how it
                        had all come about. It seemed a monstrous, unnatural, unwarranted condition
                        which had suddenly descended upon him without his let or hindrance.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile he gave a thought now and then to Carrie. What could be the trouble
                        in that quarter? No letter had come, no word of any kind, and yet here it
                        was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning.
                        To-morrow they were to have met and gone offwhere? He saw that in the
                        excitement of recent events he had not formulated a plan upon that score. He
                        was desperately in love, and would have taken great chances to win her under
                        ordinary circumstances, but nownow what? Supposing she had found out
                        something? Supposing she, too, wrote him and told him that she knew allthat
                        she would have nothing more to do with him? It would be just like this to
                        happen as things were going now. Meanwhile he had not sent the money.</p>
                    <p>He strolled up and down the polished floor of the resort, his hands in his
                        pockets, his brow wrinkled, his mouth set. He was getting some vague comfort
                        out of a good cigar, but it was no panacea for the ill which affected him.
                        Every once in a while he would clinch his fingers <pb id="VAA2423-267"
                            n="261"/> and tap his footsigns of the stirring mental process he was
                        undergoing. His whole nature was vigorously and powerfully shaken up, and he
                        was finding what limits the mind has to endurance. He drank more brandy and
                        soda than he had any evening in months. He was altogether a fine example of
                        great mental perturbation.</p>
                    <p>For all his study nothing came of the evening except thishe sent the money.
                        It was with great opposition, after two or three hours of the most urgent
                        mental affirmation and denial, that at last he got an envelope, placed in it
                        the requested amount, and slowly sealed it up.</p>
                    <p>Then he called Harry, the boy of all work around the place.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You take this to this address,&quot; he said, handing him the
                        envelope, &quot;and give it to Mrs. Hurstwood.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the boy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If she isn&apos;t there bring it back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve seen my wife?&quot; he asked as a precautionary
                        measure as the boy turned to go.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, sir. I know her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right, now. Hurry right back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Any answer?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings. Now he had done
                        it. There was no use speculating over that. He was beaten for to-night and
                        he might just as well make the best of it. But, oh, the wretchedness of
                        being forced this way! He could see her meeting the boy at the door and
                        smiling sardonically. She would take the envelope and know that she had
                        triumphed. If he only had that letter back he wouldn&apos;t send it. He
                        breathed heavily and wiped the moisture from his face.</p>
                    <p>For relief, he arose and joined in conversation with a few friends who were
                        drinking. He tried to get the interest <pb id="VAA2423-268" n="262"/> of
                        things about him, but it was not to be. All the time his thoughts would run
                        out to his home and see the scene being therein enacted. All the time he was
                        wondering what she would say when the boy handed her the envelope.</p>
                    <p>In about an hour and three-quarters the boy returned. He had evidently
                        delivered the package, for, as he came up, he made no sign of taking
                        anything out of his pocket.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well?&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I gave it to her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My wife?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Any answer?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She said it was high time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood scowled fiercely.</p>
                    <p>There was no more to be done upon that score that night. He went on brooding
                        over his situation until mid-night, when he repaired again to the Palmer
                        House. He wondered what the morning would bring forth, and slept anything
                        but soundly upon it.</p>
                    <p>Next day he went again to the office and opened his mail, suspicious and
                        hopeful of its contents. No word from Carrie. Nothing from his wife, which
                        was pleasant.</p>
                    <p>The fact that he had sent the money and that she had received it worked to
                        the ease of his mind, for, as the thought that he had done it receded, his
                        chagrin at it grew less and his hope of peace more. He fancied, as he sat at
                        his desk, that nothing would be done for a week or two. Meanwhile, he would
                        have time to think.</p>
                    <p>This process of <hi rend="i">thinking</hi> began by a reversion to Carrie and
                        the arrangement by which he was to get her away from Drouet. How about that
                        now? His pain at her failure to meet or write him rapidly increased as he
                        devoted himself to this subject. He decided to write her care of the West
                        Side Post-office and ask for an explanation, <pb id="VAA2423-269" n="263"/>
                        as well as to have her meet him. The thought that this letter would probably
                        not reach her until Monday chafed him exceedingly. He must get some speedier
                        methodbut how?</p>
                    <p>He thought upon it for a half-hour, not contemplating a messenger or a cab
                        direct to the house, owing to the exposure of it, but finding that time was
                        slipping away to no purpose, he wrote the letter and then began to think
                        again.</p>
                    <p>The hours slipped by, and with them the possibility of the union he had
                        contemplated. He had thought to be joyously aiding Carrie by now in the task
                        of joining her interests to his, and here it was afternoon and nothing done.
                        Three o&apos;clock came, four, five, six, and no letter. The helpless
                        manager paced the floor and grimly endured the gloom of defeat. He saw a
                        busy Saturday ushered out, the Sabbath in, and nothing done. All day, the
                        bar being closed, he brooded alone, shut out from home, from the excitement
                        of his resort, from Carrie, and without the ability to alter his condition
                        one iota. It was the worst Sunday he had spent in his life.</p>
                    <p>In Monday&apos;s second mail he encountered a very legal-looking letter,
                        which held his interest for some time. It bore the imprint of the law
                        offices of McGregor, James and Hay, and with a very formal &quot;Dear
                        Sir,&quot; and &quot;We beg to state,&quot; went on to inform
                        him briefly that they had been retained by Mrs. Julia Hurstwood to adjust
                        certain matters which related to her sustenance and property rights, and
                        would he kindly call and see them about the matter at once.</p>
                    <p>He read it through carefully several times, and then merely shook his head.
                        It seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well!&quot; he said after a time, quite audibly, &quot;I
                        don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-270" n="264"/>
                    <p>Then he folded it up and put it in his pocket.</p>
                    <p>To add to his misery there was no word from Carrie. He was quite certain now
                        that she knew he was married and was angered at his perfidy. His loss seemed
                        all the more bitter now that he needed her most. He thought he would go out
                        and insist on seeing her if she did not send him word of some sort soon. He
                        was really affected most miserably of all by this desertion. He had loved
                        her earnestly enough, but now that the possibility of losing her stared him
                        in the face she seemed much more attractive. He really pined for a word, and
                        looked out upon her with his mind&apos;s eye in the most wistful manner.
                        He did not propose to lose her, whatever she might think. Come what might,
                        he would adjust this matter, and soon. He would go to her and tell her all
                        his family complications. He would explain to her just where he stood and
                        how much he needed her. Surely she couldn&apos;t go back on him now? It
                        wasn&apos;t possible. He would plead until her anger would meltuntil she
                        would forgive him.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly he thought: &quot;Supposing she isn&apos;t out theresuppose
                        she has gone?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was forced to take his feet. It was too much to think of and sit
                        still.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, his rousing availed him nothing.</p>
                    <p>On Tuesday it was the same way. He did manage to bring himself into the mood
                        to go out to Carrie, but when he got in Ogden Place he thought he saw a man
                        watching him and went away. He did not go within a block of the house.</p>
                    <p>One of the galling incidents of this visit was that he came back on a
                        Randolph Street car, and without noticing arrived almost opposite the
                        building of the concern with which his son was connected. This sent a pang
                        through his heart. He had called on his boy there several times. Now the lad
                        had not sent him a word. His absence did <pb id="VAA2423-271" n="265"/> not
                        seem to be noticed by either of his children. Well, well, fortune plays a
                        man queer tricks. He got back to his office and joined in a conversation
                        with friends. It was as if idle chatter deadened the sense of misery.</p>
                    <p>That night he dined at Rector&apos;s and returned at once to his office.
                        In the bustle and show of the latter was his only relief. He troubled over
                        many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody. He stayed at his
                        desk long after all others had gone, and only quitted it when the night
                        watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely
                        locked.</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday he received another polite note from McGregor, James and Hay. It
                        read: <text>

                    <p>&quot;Compromise!&quot; exclaimed Hurstwood bitterly.
                        &quot;Compromise!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again he shook his head.</p>
                    <p>So here it was spread out clear before him, and now he knew what to expect.
                        If he didn&apos;t go and see them they would sue him promptly. If he
                        did, he would be offered terms that would make his blood boil. He folded the
                        letter and put it with the other one. Then he put on his hat and went for a
                        turn about the block.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE AMBASSADOR FALLEN: A SEARCH FOR THE GATE</head>
                    <p>Carrie, left alone by Drouet, listened to his retreating steps, scarcely
                        realising what had happened. She knew that he had stormed out. It was some
                        moments before she questioned whether he would return, not now exactly, but
                        ever. She looked around her upon the rooms, out of which the evening light
                        was dying, and wondered why she did not feel quite the same towards them.
                        She went over to the dresser and struck a match, lighting the gas. Then she
                        went back to the rocker to think.</p>
                    <p>It was some time before she could collect her thoughts, but when she did,
                        this truth began to take on importance. She was quite alone. Suppose Drouet
                        did not come back? Suppose she should never hear anything more of him? This
                        fine arrangement of chambers would not last long. She would have to quit
                        them.</p>
                    <p>To her credit, be it said, she never once counted on Hurstwood. She could
                        only approach that subject with a pang of sorrow and regret. For a truth,
                        she was rather shocked and frightened by this evidence of human depravity.
                        He would have tricked her without turning an eyelash. She would have been
                        led into a newer and worse situation. And yet she could not keep out the
                        pictures of his looks and manners. Only this one deed seemed strange and
                        miserable. It contrasted sharply with all she felt and knew concerning the
                        man.</p>
                    <p>But she was alone. That was the greater thought just at present. How about
                        that? Would she go out to <pb id="VAA2423-273" n="267"/> work again? Would
                        she begin to look around in the business district? The stage! Oh, yes.
                        Drouet had spoken about that. Was there any hope there? She moved to and
                        fro, in deep and varied thoughts, while the minutes slipped away and night
                        fell completely. She had had nothing to eat, and yet there she sat, thinking
                        it over.</p>
                    <p>She remembered that she was hungry and went to the little cupboard in the
                        rear room where were the remains of one of their breakfasts. She looked at
                        these things with certain misgivings. The contemplation of food had more
                        significance than usual.</p>
                    <p>While she was eating she began to wonder how much money she had. It struck
                        her as exceedingly important, and without ado she went to look for her
                        purse. It was on the dresser, and in it were seven dollars in bills and some
                        change. She quailed as she thought of the insignificance of the amount and
                        rejoiced because the rent was paid until the end of the month. She began
                        also to think what she would have done if she had gone out into the street
                        when she first started. By the side of that situation, as she looked at it
                        now, the present seemed agreeable. She had a little time at least, and then,
                        perhaps, everything would come out all right, after all.</p>
                    <p>Drouet had gone, but what of it? He did not seem seriously angry. He only
                        acted as if he were huffy. He would some backof course he would. There was
                        his cane in the corner. Here was one of his collars. He had left his light
                        overcoat in the wardrobe. She looked about and tried to assure herself with
                        the sight of a dozen such details, but, alas, the secondary thought arrived.
                        Supposing he did come back. Then what?</p>
                    <p>Here was another proposition nearly, if not quite, as disturbing. She would
                        have to talk with and explain to him. He would want her to admit that he was
                        right. It would be impossible for her to live with him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-274" n="268"/>
                    <p>On Friday Carrie remembered her appointment with Hurstwood, and the passing
                        of the hour when she should, by all right of promise, have been in his
                        company served to keep the calamity which had befallen her exceedingly fresh
                        and clear. In her nervousness and stress of mind she felt it necessary to
                        act, and consequently put on a brown street dress, and at eleven
                        o&apos;clock started to visit the business portion once again. She most
                        look for work.</p>
                    <p>The rain, which threatened at twelve and began at one, served equally well to
                        cause her to retrace her steps and remain within doors as it did to reduce
                        Hurstwood&apos;s spirits and give him a wretched day.</p>
                    <p>The morrow was Saturday, a half-holiday in many business quarters, and
                        besides it was a balmy, radiant day, with the trees and grass shining
                        exceedingly green after the rain of the night before. When she went out the
                        sparrows were twittering merrily in joyous choruses. She could not help
                        feeling, as she looked across the lovely park, that life was a joyous thing
                        for those who did not need to worry, and she wished over and over that
                        something might interfere now to preserve for her the comfortable state
                        which she had occupied. She did not want Drouet or his money when she
                        thought of it, nor anything more to do with Hurstwood, but only the content
                        and ease of mind she had experienced, for, after all, she had been
                        happyhappier, at least, than she was now when confronted by the necessity of
                        making her way alone.</p>
                    <p>When she arrived in the business part it was quite eleven o&apos;clock,
                        and the business had little longer to run. She did not realise this at
                        first, being affected by some of the old distress which was a result of her
                        earlier adventure into this strenuous and exacting quarter. She wandered
                        about, assuring herself that she was making up her mind to look for
                        something, and at the same time feeling that <pb id="VAA2423-275" n="269"/>
                        perhaps it was not necessary to be in such haste about it. The thing was
                        difficult to encounter, and she had a few days. Besides, she was not sure
                        that she was really face to face again with the bitter problem of
                        self-sustenance. Anyhow, there was one change for the better. She knew that
                        she had improved in appearance. Her manner had vastly changed. Her clothes
                        were becoming, and menwell-dressed men, some of the kind who before had
                        gazed at her indifferently from behind their polished railings and imposing
                        office partitionsnow gazed into her face with a soft light in their eyes. In
                        a way, she felt the power and satisfaction of the thing, but it did not
                        wholly reassure her. She looked for nothing save what might come
                        legitimately and without the appearance of special favour. She wanted
                        something, but no man should buy her by false protestations or favour. She
                        proposed to earn her living honestly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This store closes at one on Saturdays,&quot; was a pleasing and
                        satisfactory legend to see upon doors which she felt she ought to enter and
                        inquire for work. It gave her an excuse, and after encountering quite a
                        number of them, and noting that the clock registered 12.15, she decided that
                        it would be no use to seek further to-clay, so she got on a car and went to
                        Lincoln Park. There was always something to see therethe flowers, the
                        animals, the lakeand she flattered herself that on Monday she would be up
                        betimes and searching. Besides, many things might happen between now and
                        Monday.</p>
                    <p>Sunday passed with equal doubts, worries, assurances, and heaven knows what
                        vagaries of mind and spirit. Every half-hour in the day the thought would
                        come to her most sharply, like the tail of a swishing whip, that
                        actionimmediate actionwas imperative. At other times she would look about
                        her and assure herself that things were not so badthat certainly she would
                        come out safe and <pb id="VAA2423-276" n="270"/> sound. At such times she
                        would think of Drouet&apos;s advice about going on the stage, and saw
                        some chance for herself in that quarter. She decided to take up that
                        opportunity on the morrow.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, she arose early Monday morning and dressed herself carefully.
                        She did not know just how such applications were made, but she took it to be
                        a matter which related more directly to the theatre buildings. All you had
                        to do was to inquire of some one about the theatre for the manager and ask
                        for a position. If there was anything, you might get it, or, at least, he
                        could tell you how.</p>
                    <p>She had had no experience with this class of individuals whatsoever, and did
                        not know, the salacity and humour of the theatrical tribe. She only knew of
                        the position which Mr. Hale occupied, but, of all things, she did not wish
                        to encounter that personage, on account of her intimacy with his wife.</p>
                    <p>There was, however, at this time, one theatre, the Chicago Opera House, which
                        was considerably in the public eye, and its manager, David A. Henderson, had
                        a fair local reputation. Carrie had seen one or two elaborate performances
                        there and had heard of several others. She knew nothing of Henderson nor of
                        the methods of applying, but she instinctively felt that this would be a
                        likely place, and accordingly strolled about in that neighbourhood. She came
                        bravely enough to the showy entrance way, with the polished and begilded
                        lobby, set with framed pictures out of the current attraction, leading up to
                        the quiet box-office, but she could get no further. A noted comic opera
                        comedian was holding forth that week, and the air of distinction and
                        prosperity overawed her. She could not imagine that there would be anything
                        in such a lofty sphere for her. She almost trembled at the audacity which
                        might have carried her on to a terrible <pb id="VAA2423-277" n="271"/>
                        rebuff. She could find heart only to look at the pictures which were showy
                        and then walk out. It seemed to her as if she had made a splendid escape and
                        that it would be foolhardy to think of applying in that quarter again.</p>
                    <p>This little experience settled her hunting for one day. She looked around
                        elsewhere, but it was from the outside. She got the location of several
                        playhouses fixed in her mindnotably the Grand Opera House and
                        McVickar&apos;s, both of which were leading in attractionsand then came
                        away. Her spirits were materially reduced, owing to the newly restored sense
                        of magnitude of the great interests and the insignificance of her claims
                        upon society, such as she understood them to be.</p>
                    <p>That night she was visited by Mrs. Hale, whose chatter and protracted stay
                        made it impossible to dwell upon her predicament or the fortune of the day.
                        Before retiring, however, she sat down to think, and gave herself up to the
                        most gloomy forebodings. Drouet had not put in an appearance. She had had no
                        word from any quarter, she had spent a dollar of her precious sum in
                        procuring food and paying car fare. It was evident that she would not endure
                        long. Besides, she had discovered no resource.</p>
                    <p>In this situation her thoughts went out to her sister in Van Buren Street,
                        whom she had not seen since the night of her flight, and to her home at
                        Columbia City, which seemed now a part of something that could not be again.
                        She looked for no refuge in that direction. Nothing but sorrow was brought
                        her by thoughts of Hurstwood, which would return. That he could have chosen
                        to dupe her in so ready a manner seemed a cruel thing.</p>
                    <p>Tuesday came, and with it appropriate indecision and speculation. She was in
                        no mood, after her failure of the day before, to hasten forth upon her
                        work-seeking errand, and yet she rebuked herself for what she considered her
                        weakness the day before. Accordingly she started out to <pb id="VAA2423-278"
                            n="272"/> revisit the Chicago Opera House, but possessed scarcely enough
                        courage to approach.</p>
                    <p>She did manage to inquire at the box-office, however.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Manager of the company or the house?&quot; asked the smartly
                        dressed individual who tools care of the tickets. He was favourably
                        impressed by Carrie&apos;s looks.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Carrie, taken back by the
                        question.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You couldn&apos;t see the manager of the house to-day,
                        anyhow,&quot; volunteered the young man. &quot;He&apos;s out of
                        town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He noted her puzzled look, and then added: &quot;What is it you wish to
                        see about?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to see about getting a position,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d better see the manager of the company,&quot; he
                        returned, &quot;but he isn&apos;t here now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When will he be in?&quot; asked Carrie, somewhat relieved by
                        this information.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you might find him in between eleven and twelve.
                        He&apos;s here after two o&apos;clock.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie thanked him and walked briskly out, while the young man gazed after
                        her through one of the side windows of his gilded coop.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-looking,&quot; he said to himself, and proceeded to
                        visions of condescensions on her part which were exceedingly flattering to
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>One of the principal comedy companies of the day was playing an engagement at
                        the Grand Opera House. Here Carrie asked to see the manager of the company.
                        She little knew the trivial authority of this individual, or that had there
                        been a vacancy an actor would have been sent on from New York to fill
                        it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;His office is upstairs,&quot; said a man in the box-office.</p>
                    <p>Several persons were in the manager&apos;s office, two lounging near a
                        window, another talking to an individual sitting at a roll-top deskthe
                        manager. Carrie glanced <pb id="VAA2423-279" n="273"/> nervously about, and
                        began to fear that she should have to make her appeal before the assembled
                        company, two of whomthe occupants of the windowwere already observing her
                        carefully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t do it,&quot; the manager was saying;
                        &quot;it&apos;s a rule of Mr. Frohman&apos;s never to allow
                        visitors back of the stage. No, no!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie timidly waited, standing. There were chairs, but no one motioned her
                        to be seated. The individual to whom the manager had been talking went away
                        quite crestfallen. That luminary gazed earnestly at some papers before him,
                        as if they were of the greatest concern.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you see that in the &apos;Herald&apos; this morning
                        about Nat Goodwin, Harris?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said the person addressed. &quot;What was
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Made quite a curtain address at Hooley&apos;s last night.
                        Better look it up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Harris reached over to a table and began to look for the
                        &quot;Herald.&quot;</p>
                    <p>What is it?&quot; said the manager to Carrie, apparently noticing her for
                        the first time. He thought he was going to be held up for free tickets.</p>
                    <p>Carrie summoned up all her courage, which was little at best. She realised
                        that she was a novice, and felt as if a rebuff were certain. Of this she was
                        so sure that she only wished now to pretend she had called for advice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can you tell me how to go about getting on the stage?&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was the best way after all to have gone about the matter. She was
                        interesting, in a manner, to the occupant of the chair, and the simplicity
                        of her request and attitude took his fancy. He smiled, as did the others in
                        the room, who, however, made some slight effort to conceal their humour.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he answered, looking her brazenly
                            <pb id="VAA2423-280" n="274"/> over. &quot;Have you ever had any
                        experience upon the stage?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A little,&quot; answered Carrie. &quot;I have taken part in
                        amateur performances.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She thought she had to make some sort of showing in order to retain his
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never studied for the stage?&quot; he said, putting on an air
                        intended as much to impress his friends with his discretion as Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know,&quot; he answered, tipping lazily
                        back in his chair while she stood before him. &quot;What makes you want
                        to get on the stage?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She felt abashed at the man&apos;s daring, but could only smile in answer
                        to his engaging smirk, and say:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I need to make a living.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he answered, rather taken by her trim appearance, and
                        feeling as if he might scrape up an acquaintance with her.
                        &quot;That&apos;s a good reason, isn&apos;t it? Well, Chicago is
                        not a good place for what you want to do. You ought to be in New York.
                        There&apos;s more chance there. You could hardly expect to get started
                        out here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie smiled genially, grateful that he should condescend to advise her even
                        so much. He noticed the smile, and put a slightly different construction on
                        it. He thought he saw an easy chance for a little flirtation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sit down,&quot; he said, pulling a chair forward from the side
                        of his desk and dropping his voice so that the two men in the room should
                        not hear. Those two gave each other the suggestion of a wink.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll be going, Barney,&quot; said one, breaking
                        away and so addressing the manager. &quot;See you this
                        afternoon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said the manager.</p>
                    <p>The remaining individual took up a paper as if to read.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-281" n="275"/>
                    <p>&quot;Did you have any idea what sort of part you would like to
                        get?&quot; asked the manager softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;I would take anything to
                        begin with.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see,&quot; he said. &quot;Do you live here in the
                        city?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The manager smiled most blandly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you ever tried to get in as a chorus girl?&quot; he asked,
                        assuming a more confidential air.</p>
                    <p>Carrie began to feel that there was something exuberant and unnatural in his
                        manner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the way most girls begin,&quot; he went on,
                        &quot;who go on the stage. It&apos;s a good way to get
                        experience.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was turning on her a glance of the companionable and persuasive
                        manner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t know that,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a difficult thing,&quot; he went on,
                        &quot;but there&apos;s always a chance, you know.&quot; Then, as
                        if he suddenly remembered, he pulled out his watch and consulted it.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve an appointment at two,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;and I&apos;ve got to go to lunch now. Would you care to come
                        and dine with me? We can talk it over there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Carrie, the whole motive of the man flashing
                        on her at once. &quot;I have an engagement myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s too bad,&quot; he said, realising that he had
                        been a little beforehand in his offer and that Carrie was about to go away.
                        &quot;Come in later. I may know of something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she answered, with some trepidation, and went
                        out.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She was good-looking, wasn&apos;t she?&quot; said the
                        manager&apos;s companion, who had not caught all the details of the game
                        he had played.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, in a way,&quot; said the other, sore to think the game <pb
                            id="VAA2423-282" n="276"/> had been lost. &quot;She&apos;d never
                        make an actress, though. Just another chorus girlthat&apos;s
                        all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This little experience nearly destroyed her ambition to call upon the manager
                        at the Chicago Opera House, but she decided to do so after a time. He was of
                        a more sedate turn of mind. He said at once that there was no opening of any
                        sort, and seemed to consider her search foolish.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Chicago is no place to get a start,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;You ought to be in New York.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Still she persisted, and went to McVickar&apos;s, where she could not
                        find any one. &quot;The Old Homestead&quot; was running there, but
                        the person to whom she was referred was not to be found.</p>
                    <p>These little expeditions took up her time until quite four o&apos;clock,
                        when she was weary enough to go home. She felt as if she ought to continue
                        and inquire elsewhere, but the results so far were too dispiriting. She took
                        the car and arrived at Ogden Place in three-quarters of an hour, but decided
                        to ride on to the West Side branch of the Post-office, where she was
                        accustomed to receive Hurstwood&apos;s letters. There was one there now,
                        written Saturday, which she tore open and read with mingled feelings. There
                        was so much warmth in it and such tense complaint at her having failed to
                        meet him, and her subsequent silence, that she rather pitied the man. That
                        he loved her was evident enough. That he had wished and dared to do so,
                        married as he was, was the evil. She felt as if the thing deserved an
                        answer, and consequently decided that she would write and let him know that
                        she knew of his married state and was justly incensed at his deception. She
                        would tell him that it was all over between them.</p>
                    <p>At her room, the wording of this missive occupied her for some time, for she
                        fell to the task at once. It was most difficult.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-283" n="277"/>
                    <p>&quot;You do not need to have me explain why I did not meet
                        you,&quot; she wrote in part. &quot;How could you deceive me so? You
                        cannot expect me to have anything more to do with you. I wouldn&apos;t
                        under any circumstances. Oh, how could you act so?&quot; she added in a
                        burst of feeling. &quot;You have caused me more misery than you can
                        think. I hope you will get over your infatuation for me. We must not meet
                        any more. Good-bye.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She took the letter the next morning, and at the corner dropped it
                        reluctantly into the letter-box, still uncertain as to whether she should do
                        so or not. Then she took the car and went down town.</p>
                    <p>This was the dull season with the department stores, but she was listened to
                        with more consideration than was usually accorded to young women applicants,
                        owing to her neat and attractive appearance. She was asked the same old
                        questions with which she was already familiar.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What can you do? Have you ever worked in a retail store before? Are
                        you experienced?&quot;</p>
                    <p>At The Fair, See and Company&apos;s, and all the great stores it was much
                        the same. It was the dull season, she might come in a little later, possibly
                        they would like to have her.</p>
                    <p>When she arrived at the house at the end of the day, weary and disheartened,
                        she discovered that Drouet had been there. His umbrella and light overcoat
                        were gone. She thought she missed other things, but could not be sure.
                        Everything had not been taken.</p>
                    <p>So his going was crystallising into staying. What was she to do now?
                        Evidently she would be facing the world in the same old way within a day or
                        two. Her clothes would get poor. She put her two hands together in her
                        customary expressive way and pressed her fingers. Large tears gathered in
                        her eyes and broke hot across her cheeks. She was alone, very much
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>Drouet really had called, but it was with a very different <pb
                            id="VAA2423-284" n="278"/> mind from that which Carrie had imagined. He
                        expected to find her, to justify his return by claiming that he came to get
                        the remaining portion of his wardrobe, and before he got away again to patch
                        up a peace.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, when he arrived, he was disappointed to find Carrie out. He
                        trifled about, hoping that she was somewhere in the neighbourhood and would
                        soon return. He constantly listened, expecting to hear her foot on the
                        stair.</p>
                    <p>When he did so, it was his intention to make believe that he had just come in
                        and was disturbed at being caught. Then he would explain his need of his
                        clothes and find out how things stood.</p>
                    <p>Wait as he did, however, Carrie did not come. From pottering around among the
                        drawers, in momentary expectation of her arrival, he changed to looking out
                        of the window, and from that to resting himself in the rocking-chair. Still
                        no Carrie. He began to grow restless and lit a cigar. After that he walked
                        the floor. Then he looked out of the window and saw clouds gathering. He
                        remembered an appointment at three. He began to think that it would be
                        useless to wait, and got hold of his umbrella and light coat, intending to
                        take these things, any way. It would scare her, he hoped. To-morrow he would
                        come back for the others. He would find out how things stood.</p>
                    <p>As he started to go he felt truly sorry that he had missed her. There was a
                        little picture of her on the wall, showing her arrayed in the little jacket
                        he had first bought herher face a little more wistful than he had seen it
                        lately. He was really touched by it, and looked into the eyes of it with a
                        rather rare feeling for him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You didn&apos;t do me right, Cad,&quot; he said, as if he
                        were addressing her in the flesh.</p>
                    <p>Then he went to the door, took a good look around, and went out.</p>

                    <p>It was when he returned from his disturbed stroll about the streets, after
                        receiving the decisive note from McGregor, James and Hay, that Hurstwood
                        found the letter Carrie had written him that morning. He thrilled intensely
                        as he noted the handwriting, and rapidly tore it open.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then,&quot; he thought, &quot;she loves me or she would not
                        have written to me at all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was slightly depressed at the tenor of the note for the first few minutes,
                        but soon recovered. &quot;She wouldn&apos;t write at all if site
                        didn&apos;t care for me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was his one resource against the depression which held him. He could
                        extract little from the wording of the letter, but the spirit he thought he
                        knew.</p>
                    <p>There was really something exceedingly humanif not patheticin his being thus
                        relieved by a clearly worded reproof. He who had for so long remained
                        satisfied with himself now looked outside of himself for comfortand to such
                        a source. The mystic cords of affection! How they bind us all.</p>
                    <p>The colour came to his cheeks. For the moment he forgot the letter from
                        McGregor, James and Hay. If he could only have Carrie, perhaps he could get
                        out of the whole entanglementperhaps it would not matter. He
                        wouldn&apos;t care what his wife did with herself if only he might not
                        lose Carrie. He stood up and walked about, <pb id="VAA2423-286" n="280"/>
                        dreaming his delightful dream of a life continued with this lovely possessor
                        of his heart.</p>
                    <p>It was not long, however, before the old worry was back for consideration,
                        and with it what weariness! He thought of the morrow and the suit. He had
                        done nothing, and here was the afternoon slipping away. It was now a quarter
                        of four. At five the attorneys would have gone home. He still had the morrow
                        until noon. Even as he thought, the last fifteen minutes passed away and it
                        was five. Then he abandoned the thought of seeing them any more that day and
                        turned to Carrie.</p>
                    <p>It is to be observed that the man did not justify himself to himself. He was
                        not troubling about that. His whole thought was the possibility of
                        persuading Carrie. Nothing was wrong in that. He loved her dearly. Their
                        mutual happiness depended upon it. Would that Drouet were only away!</p>
                    <p>While he was thinking thus elatedly, he remembered that he wanted some clean
                        linen in the morning.</p>
                    <p>This he purchased, together with a half-dozen ties, and went to the Palmer
                        House. As he entered he thought he saw Drouet ascending the stairs with a
                        key. Surely not Drouet! Then he thought, perhaps they had changed their
                        abode temporarily. He went straight up to the desk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is Mr. Drouet stopping here?&quot; he asked of the clerk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think he is,&quot; said the latter, consulting his private
                        registry list. &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that so?&quot; exclaimed Hurstwood, otherwise concealing his
                        astonishment. &quot;Alone?&quot; he added.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the clerk.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood turned away and set his lips so as best to express and conceal his
                        feelings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How&apos;s that?&quot; he thought.
                        &quot;They&apos;ve had a row.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He hastened to his room with rising spirits and changed <pb id="VAA2423-287"
                            n="281"/> his linen. As he did so, he made up his mind that if Carrie
                        was alone, or if she had gone to another place, it behooved him to find out.
                        He decided to call at once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know what I&apos;ll do,&quot; he thought.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll go to the door and ask if Mr. Drouet is at home.
                        That will bring out whether he is there or not and where Carrie
                        is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was almost moved to some muscular display as he thought of it. He decided
                        to go immediately after supper.</p>
                    <p>On coming down from his room at six, he looked carefully about to see if
                        Drouet was present and then went out to lunch. He could scarcely eat,
                        however, he was so anxious to be about his errand. Before starting he
                        thought it well to discover where Drouet would be, and returned to his
                        hotel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Has Mr. Drouet gone out?&quot; he asked of the clerk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; answered the latter, &quot;he&apos;s in his
                        room. Do you wish to send up a card?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I&apos;ll call around later,&quot; answered Hurstwood,
                        and strolled out.</p>
                    <p>He took a Madison car and went direct to Ogden Place, this time walking
                        boldly up to the door. The chambermaid answered his knock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is Mr. Drouet in?&quot; said Hurstwood blandly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is out of the city,&quot; said the girl, who had heard
                        Carrie tell this to Mrs. Hale.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is Mrs. Drouet in?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, she has gone to the theatre.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that so?&quot; said Hurstwood, considerably taken back;
                        then, as if burdened with something important, &quot;You don&apos;t
                        know to which theatre?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The girl really had no idea where she had gone, but not liking Hurstwood, and
                        wishing to cause him trouble, answered: &quot;Yes,
                        Hooley&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; returned the manager, and, tipping his hat
                        slightly, went away.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-288" n="282"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll look in at Hooley&apos;s,&quot; thought he,
                        but as a matter of fact he did not. Before he had reached the central
                        portion of the city he thought the whole matter over and decided it would be
                        useless. As much as he longed to see Carrie, he knew she would be with some
                        one and did not wish to intrude with his plea there. A little later he might
                        do soin the morning. Only in the morning he had the lawyer question before
                        him.</p>
                    <p>This little pilgrimage threw quite a wet blanket upon his rising spirits. He
                        was soon down again to his old worry, and reached the resort anxious to find
                        relief. Quite a company of gentlemen were making the place lively with their
                        conversation. A group of Cook County politicians were conferring about a
                        round cherry-wood table in the rear portion of the room. Several young
                        merry-makers were chattering at the bar before making a belated visit to the
                        theatre. A shabbily-genteel individual, with a red nose and an old high hat,
                        was sipping a quiet glass of ale alone at one end of the bar. Hurstwood
                        nodded to the politicians and went into his office.</p>
                    <p>About ten o&apos;clock a friend of his, Mr. Frank L. Taintor, a local
                        sport and racing man, dropped in, and seeing Hurstwood alone in his office
                        came to the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello, George!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How are you, Frank?&quot; said Hurstwood, somewhat relieved by
                        the sight of hill. &quot;Sit down,&quot; and he motioned him to one
                        of the chairs in the little room.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter, George?&quot; asked Taintor.
                        &quot;You look a little glum. Haven&apos;t lost at the track, have
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not feeling very well to-night. I had a slight cold
                        the other day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take whiskey, George,&quot; said Taintor. &quot;You ought
                        to know that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood smiled.</p>
                    <p>While they were still conferring there, several other of <pb id="VAA2423-289"
                            n="283"/> Hurstwood&apos;s friends entered, and not long after
                        eleven, the theatres being out, some actors began to drop inamong them some
                        notabilities.</p>
                    <p>Then began one of those pointless social conversations so common in American
                        resorts where the would-be <hi rend="i">gilded</hi> attempt to rub off gilt
                        from those who have it in abundance. If Hurstwood had one leaning, it was
                        toward notabilities. He considered that, if anywhere, he belonged among
                        them. He was too proud to toady, too keen not to strictly observe the plane
                        he occupied when there were those present who did not appreciate him, but,
                        in situations like the present, where he could shine as a gentleman and be
                        received without equivocation as a friend and equal among men of known
                        ability, he was most delighted. It was on such occasions, if ever, that he
                        would &quot;take something.&quot; When the social flavour was strong
                        enough he would even unbend to the extent of drinking glass for glass with
                        his associates, punctiliously observing his turn to pay as if he were an
                        outsider like the others. If he ever approached intoxicationor rather that
                        ruddy warmth and comfortableness which precedes the more sloven stateit was
                        when individuals such as these were gathered about him, when he was one of a
                        circle of chatting celebrities. To-night, disturbed as was his state, he was
                        rather relieved to find company, and now that notabilities were gathered, he
                        laid aside his troubles for the nonce, and joined in right heartily.</p>
                    <p>It was not long before the imbibing began to tell. Stories began to crop
                        upthose ever-enduring, droll stories which form the major portion of the
                        conversation among American men under such circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Twelve o&apos;clock arrived, the hour for closing, and with it the
                        company tools leave. Hurstwood shook hands with them most cordially. He was
                        very roseate physically. He had arrived at that state where his mind, though
                        clear, <pb id="VAA2423-290" n="284"/> was, nevertheless, warm in its
                        fancies. He felt as if his troubles were not very serious. Going into his
                        office, he began to turn over certain accounts, awaiting the departure of
                        the bartenders and the cashier, who soon left.</p>
                    <p>It was the manager&apos;s duty, as well as his custom, after all were
                        gone to see that everything was safely closed up for the night. As a rule,
                        no money except the cash taken in after banking hours was kept about the
                        place, and that was locked in the safe by the cashier, who, with the owners,
                        was joint keeper of the secret combination, but, nevertheless, Hurstwood
                        nightly took the precaution to try the cash drawers and the safe in order to
                        see that they were tightly closed. Then he would lock his own little office
                        and set the proper light burning near the safe, after which he would take
                        his departure.</p>
                    <p>Never in his experience had he found anything out of order, but to-night,
                        after shutting down his desk, he came out and tried the safe. His way was to
                        give a sharp pull. This time the door responded. He was slightly surprised
                        at that, and looking in found the money cases as left for the day,
                        apparently unprotected. His first thought was, of course, to inspect the
                        drawers and shut the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll speak to Mayhew, about this to-morrow,&quot; he
                        thought.</p>
                    <p>The latter had certainly imagined upon going out a half-hour before that he
                        had turned the knob on the door so as to spring the lock. He had never
                        failed to do so before. But to-night Mayhew had other thoughts. He had been
                        revolving the problem of a business of his own.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll look in here,&quot; thought the manager, pulling
                        out the money drawers. He did not know why he wished to look in there. It
                        was quite a superfluous action, which another time might not have happened
                        at all.</p>
                    <p>As he did so, a layer of bills, in parcels of a thousand, such as banks
                        issue, caught his eye. He could not tell <pb id="VAA2423-291" n="285"/> how
                        much they represented, but paused to view them. Then he pulled out the
                        second of the cash drawers. In that were the receipts of the day.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t know Fitzgerald and Moy ever left any money this
                        way,&quot; his mind said to itself. &quot;They must have forgotten
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at the other drawer and paused again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Count them,&quot; said a voice in his ear.</p>
                    <p>He put his hand into the first of the boxes and lifted the stack, letting the
                        separate parcels fall. They were bills of fifty and one hundred dollars done
                        in packages of a thousand. He thought he counted ten such.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t I shut the safe?&quot; his mind said to
                        itself, lingering. &quot;What makes me pause here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>For answer there came the strangest words:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you ever have ten thousand dollars in ready
                        money?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lo, the manager remembered that he had never had so much. All his property
                        had been slowly accumulated, and now his wife owned that. He was worth more
                        than forty thousand, all toldbut site would get that.</p>
                    <p>He puzzled as he thought of these things, then pushed in the drawers and
                        closed the door, pausing with his hand upon the knob, which might so easily
                        lock it all beyond temptation. Still he paused. Finally he went to the
                        windows and pulled down the curtains. Then he tried the door, which he had
                        previously locked. What was this thing, making him suspicious? Why did he
                        wish to move about so quietly. He came back to the end of the counter as if
                        to rest his arm and think. Then he went and unlocked his little office door
                        and turned on the light. He also opened his desk, sitting down before it,
                        only to think strange thoughts.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The safe is open,&quot; said a voice. &quot;There is just
                        the least little crack in it. The lock has not been sprung.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-292" n="286"/>
                    <p>The manager floundered among a jumble of thoughts. Now all the entanglement
                        of the day came back. Also the thought that here was a solution. That money
                        would do it. If he had that and Carrie. He rose up and stood stock-still,
                        looking at the floor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What about it?&quot; his mind asked, and for answer he put his
                        hand slowly up and scratched his head.</p>
                    <p>The manager was no fool to be led blindly away by such an errant proposition
                        as this, but his situation was peculiar. Wine was in his veins. It had crept
                        up into his head and given him a warm view of the situation. It also
                        coloured the possibilities of ten thousand for him. He could see great
                        opportunities with that. He could get Carrie. Oh, yes, he could! He could
                        get rid of his wife. That letter, too, was waiting discussion to-morrow
                        morning. He would not need to answer that. He went back to the safe and put
                        his hand on the knob. Then he pulled the door open and took the drawer with
                        the money quite out.</p>
                    <p>With it once out and before him, it seemed a foolish thing to think about
                        leaving it. Certainly it would. Why, he could live quietly with Carrie for
                        years.</p>
                    <p>Lord! what was that? For the first time he was tense, as if a stern hand had
                        been laid upon his shoulder. He looked fearfully around. Not a soul was
                        present. Not a sound. Some one was shuffling by on the sidewalk. He took the
                        box and the money and put it back in the safe. Then he partly closed the
                        door again.</p>
                    <p>To those who have never wavered in conscience, the predicament of the
                        individual whose mind is less strongly constituted and who trembles in the
                        balance between duty and desire is scarcely appreciable, unless graphically
                        portrayed. Those who have never heard that solemn voice of the ghostly clock
                        which ticks with awful distinctness, &quot;thou shalt,&quot;
                        &quot;thou shalt not,&quot; &quot;thou shalt,&quot;
                        &quot;thou shalt <pb id="VAA2423-293" n="287"/> not,&quot; are in no
                        position to judge. Not alone in sensitive, highly organised natures is such
                        a mental conflict possible. The dullest specimen of humanity, when drawn by
                        desire toward evil, is recalled by a sense of right, which is proportionate
                        in power and strength to his evil tendency. We must remember that it may not
                        be a knowledge of right, for no knowledge of right is predicated of the
                        animal&apos;s instinctive recoil at evil. Men are still led by instinct
                        before they are regulated by knowledge. It is instinct which recalls the
                        criminalit is instinct (where highly organised reasoning is absent) which
                        gives the criminal his feeling of danger, his fear of wrong.</p>
                    <p>At every first adventure, then, into some untried evil, the mind wavers. The
                        clock of thought ticks out its wish and its denial. To those who have never
                        experienced such a mental dilemma, the following will appeal on the simple
                        ground of revelation.</p>
                    <p>When Hurstwood put the money back, his nature again resumed its ease and
                        daring. No one had observed him. He was quite alone. No one could tell what
                        he wished to do. He could work this thing out for himself.</p>
                    <p>The imbibation of the evening had not yet worn off. Moist as was his brow,
                        tremble as did his hand once after the nameless fright, he was still flushed
                        with the fumes of liquor. He scarcely noticed that the time was passing. He
                        went over his situation once again, his eye always seeing the money in a
                        lump, his mind always seeing what it would do. He strolled into his little
                        room, then to the door, then to the safe again. He put his hand on the knob
                        and opened it. There was the money! Surely no harm could come from looking
                        at it!</p>
                    <p>He took out the drawer again and lifted the bills. They were so smooth, so
                        compact, so portable. How little they made, after all. He decided he would
                        take them. Yes, he would. He would put them in his pocket. Then he <pb
                            id="VAA2423-294" n="288"/> looked at that and saw they would not go
                        there. His hand satchel! To be sure, his hand satchel. They would go in
                        thatall of it would. No one would think anything of it either. He went into
                        the little office and took it from the shelf in the corner. Now he set it
                        upon his desk and went out toward the safe. For some reason he did not want
                        to fill it out in the big room.</p>
                    <p>First he brought the bills and then the loose receipts of the day. He would
                        take it all. He put the empty drawers back and pushed the iron door almost
                        to, then stood beside it meditating.</p>
                    <p>The wavering of a mind under such circumstances is an almost inexplicable
                        thing, and yet it is absolutely true. Hurstwood could not bring himself to
                        act definitely. He wanted to think about itto ponder over it, to decide
                        whether it were best. He was drawn by such a keen desire for Carrie, driven
                        by such a state of turmoil in his own affairs that he thought constantly it
                        would be best, and yet he wavered. He did not know what evil might result
                        from it to himhow soon he might come to grief. The true ethics of the
                        situation never once occurred to him, and never would have, under any
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>After he had all the money in the hand bag, a revulsion of feeling seized
                        him. He would not do itno! Think of what a scandal it would make. The
                        police! They would be after him. He would have to fly, and where? Oh, the
                        terror of being a fugitive from justice! He took out the two boxes and put
                        all the stoney back. In his excitement he forgot what he was doing, and put
                        the sums in the wrong boxes. As he pushed the door to, he thought he
                        remembered doing it wrong and opened the door again. There were the two
                        boxes mixed.</p>
                    <p>He took them out and straightened the matter, but now the terror had gone.
                        Why be afraid?</p>
                    <p>While the money was in his hand the lock clicked. It <pb id="VAA2423-295"
                            n="289"/> had sprung! Did he do it? He grabbed at the knob and pulled
                        vigorously. It had closed. Heavens! he was in for it now, sure enough.</p>
                    <p>The moment he realised that the safe was locked for a surety, the sweat burst
                        out upon his brow and he trembled violently. He looked about him and decided
                        instantly. There was no delaying now.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Supposing I do lay it on the top,&quot; he said, &quot;and
                        go away, they&apos;ll know who took it. I&apos;m the last to close
                        up. Besides, other things will happen&quot;</p>
                    <p>At once he became the man of action.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must get out of this,&quot; he thought.</p>
                    <p>He hurried into his little room, took down his light overcoat and hat, locked
                        his desk, and grabbed the satchel. Then he turned out all but one light and
                        opened the door. He tried to put on his old assured air, but it was almost
                        gone. He was repenting rapidly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish I hadn&apos;t done that,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;That was a mistake.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He walked steadily down the street, greeting a night watchman whom he knew
                        who was trying doors. He must get out of the city, and that quickly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder how the trains run?&quot; he thought.</p>
                    <p>Instantly he pulled out his watch and looked. It was nearly half-past
                        one.</p>
                    <p>At the first drug store he stopped, seeing a long-distance telephone booth
                        inside. It was a famous drug store, and contained one of the first private
                        telephone booths ever erected.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to use your &apos;phone a minute,&quot; he said to
                        the night clerk.</p>
                    <p>The latter nodded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give me 1643,&quot; he called to Central, after looking up the
                        Michigan Central depot number. Soon he got the ticket agent.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-296" n="290"/>
                    <p>&quot;How do the trains leave here for Detroit?&quot; he asked. The
                        man explained the hours.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No more to-night?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing with a sleeper. Yes, there is, too,&quot; he added.
                        &quot;There is a mail train out of here at three
                        o&apos;clock.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Hurstwood. &quot;What time does that
                        get to Detroit?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was thinking if he could only get there and cross the river into Canada,
                        he could take his time about getting to Montreal. He was relieved to learn
                        that it would reach there by noon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mayhew won&apos;t open the safe till nine,&quot; he
                        thought. &quot;They can&apos;t get on my track before
                        noon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then he thought of Carrie. With what speed must he get her, if he got her at
                        all. She would have to come along. He jumped into the nearest cab standing
                        by.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To Ogden Place,&quot; he said sharply. &quot;I&apos;ll
                        give you a dollar more if you make good time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The cabby beat his horse into a sort of imitation gallop, which was fairly
                        fast, however. On the way Hurstwood thought what to do. Reaching the number,
                        he hurried up the steps and did not spare the bell in waking the
                        servant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is Mrs. Drouet in?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the astonished girl.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell her to dress and come to the door at once. Her husband is in
                        the hospital, injured, and wants to see her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The servant girl hurried upstairs, convinced by the man&apos;s strained
                        and emphatic manner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What!&quot; said Carrie, lighting the gas and searching for her
                        clothes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Drouet is hurt and in the hospital. He wants to see you. The
                        cab&apos;s downstairs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie dressed very rapidly, and soon appeared below, forgetting everything
                        save the necessities.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-297" n="291"/>
                    <p>&quot;Drouet is hurt,&quot; said Hurstwood quickly. &quot;He
                        wants to see you. Come quickly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie was so bewildered that she swallowed the whole story.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Get in,&quot; said Hurstwood, helping her and jumping
                        after.</p>
                    <p>The cabby began to turn the horse around.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Michigan Central depot,&quot; he said, standing up and speaking
                        so low that Carrie could not hear, &quot;as fast as you can
                        go.&quot;.</p>

                    <p>The cab had not travelled a short block before Carrie, settling herself and
                        thoroughly waking in the night atmosphere, asked:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter with him? Is he hurt
                        badly?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t anything very serious,&quot; Hurstwood said
                        solemnly. He was very much disturbed over his own situation, and now that he
                        had Carrie with him, he only wanted to get safely out of reach of the law.
                        Therefore he was in no mood for anything save such words as would further
                        his plans distinctly.</p>
                    <p>Carrie did not forget that there was something to be settled between her and
                        Hurstwood, but the thought was ignored in her agitation. The one thing was
                        to finish this strange pilgrimage.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Way out on the South Side,&quot; said Hurstwood.
                        &quot;We&apos;ll have to take the train. It&apos;s the quickest
                        way.&quot; Carrie said nothing, and the horse gambolled on. The
                        weirdness of the city by night held her attention. She looked at the long
                        receding rows of lamps and studied the dark, silent houses.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did he hurt himself?&quot; she askedmeaning what was the
                        nature of his injuries. Hurstwood understood. He hated to lie any more than
                        necessary, and yet he wanted no protests until he was out of danger.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know exactly,&quot; he said. &quot;They
                        just called me <pb id="VAA2423-299" n="293"/> up to go and get you and bring
                        you out. They said there wasn&apos;t any need for alarm, but that I
                        shouldn&apos;t fail to bring you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The man&apos;s serious manner convinced Carrie, and she became silent,
                        wondering.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood examined his watch and urged the man to hurry. For one in so
                        delicate a position he was exceedingly cool. He could only think of how
                        needful it was to make the train and get quietly away. Carrie seemed quite
                        tractable, and he congratulated himself.</p>
                    <p>In due time they reached the depot, and after helping her out he handed the
                        man a five-dollar bill and hurried on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You wait here,&quot; he said to Carrie, when they reached the
                        waiting-room, &quot;while I get the tickets.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have I much time to catch that train for Detroit?&quot; he
                        asked of the agent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Four minutes,&quot; said the latter.</p>
                    <p>He paid for two tickets as circumspectly as possible.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it far?&quot; said Carrie, as he hurried back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not very,&quot; he said. &quot;We must get right
                        in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He pushed her before him at the gate, stood between her and the ticket man
                        while the latter punched their tickets, so that she could not see, and then
                        hurried after.</p>
                    <p>There was a long line of express and passenger cars and one or two common day
                        coaches. As the train had only recently been made up and few passengers were
                        expected, there were only one or two brakemen waiting. They entered the rear
                        day coach and sat down. Almost immediately, &quot;All aboard,&quot;
                        resounded faintly from the outside, and the train started.</p>
                    <p>Carrie began to think it was a little bit curiousthis going to a depotbut
                        said nothing. The whole incident was so out of the natural that she did not
                        attach too much weight to anything she imagined.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-300" n="294"/>
                    <p>&quot;How have you been?&quot; asked Hurstwood gently, for he now
                        breathed easier.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Carrie, who was so disturbed that she
                        could not bring a proper attitude to bear in the matter. She was still
                        nervous to reach Drouet and see what could be the matter. Hurstwood
                        contemplated her and felt this. He was not disturbed that it should be so.
                        He did not trouble because she was moved sympathetically in the matter. It
                        was one of the qualities in her which pleased him exceedingly. He was only
                        thinking how he should explain. Even this was not the most serious thing in
                        his mind, however. His own deed and present flight were the great shadows
                        which weighed upon him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a fool I was to do that,&quot; he said over and over.
                        &quot;What a mistake!&quot;</p>
                    <p>In his sober senses, he could scarcely realise that the thing had been done.
                        He could not begin to feel that he was a fugitive from justice. He had often
                        read of such things, and had thought they must be terrible, but now that the
                        thing was upon him, he only sat and looked into the past. The future was a
                        thing which concerned the Canadian line. He wanted to reach that. As for the
                        rest, he surveyed his actions for the evening, and counted them parts of a
                        great mistake.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Still,&quot; he said, &quot;what could I have
                        done?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then he would decide to make the best of it, and would begin to do so by
                        starting the whole inquiry over again. It was a fruitless, harassing round,
                        and left him in a queer mood to deal with the proposition he had in the
                        presence of Carrie.</p>
                    <p>The train clacked through the yards along the lake front, and ran rather
                        slowly to Twenty-fourth Street. Brakes and signals were visible without. The
                        engine gave short calls with its whistle, and frequently the bell rang.
                        Several brakemen came through, bearing lanterns. They <pb id="VAA2423-301"
                            n="295"/> were locking the vestibules and putting the cars in order for
                        a long run.</p>
                    <p>Presently it began to gain speed, and Carrie saw the silent streets flashing
                        by in rapid succession. The engine also began its whistle-calls of four
                        parts, with which it signalled danger to important crossings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it very far?&quot; asked Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so very,&quot; said Hurstwood. He could hardly repress a
                        smile at her simplicity. He wanted to explain and conciliate her, but he
                        also wanted to be well out of Chicago.</p>
                    <p>In the lapse of another half-hour it became apparent to Carrie that it was
                        quite a run to wherever he was taking her, anyhow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it in Chicago?&quot; she asked nervously. They were now far
                        beyond the city limits, and the train was scudding across the Indiana line
                        at a great rate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;not where we are
                        going.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was something in the way he said this which aroused her in an
                        instant.</p>
                    <p>Her pretty brow began to contract.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We are going to see Charlie, aren&apos;t we?&quot; she
                        asked.</p>
                    <p>He felt that the time was up. An explanation might as well come now as later.
                        Therefore, he shook his head in the most gentle negative.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot; said Carrie. She was nonplussed at the possibility
                        of the errand being different from what she had thought.</p>
                    <p>He only looked at her in the most kindly and mollifying way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, where are you taking me, then?&quot; she asked, her voice
                        showing the quality of fright.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll tell you, Carrie, if you&apos;ll be quiet. I want
                        you to come along with me to another city.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-302" n="296"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Carrie, her voice rising into a weak cry.
                        &quot;Let me off I don&apos;t want to go with you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was quite appalled at the man&apos;s audacity. This was something
                        which had never for a moment entered her head. Her one thought now was to
                        get off and away. If only the flying train could be stopped, the terrible
                        trick would be amended.</p>
                    <p>She arose and tried to push out into the aisleanywhere. She knew she had to
                        do something. Hurstwood laid a gentle hand on her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sit still, Carrie,&quot; he said. &quot;Sit still. It
                        won&apos;t do you any good to get up here. Listen to me and
                        I&apos;ll tell you what I&apos;ll do. Wait a moment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was pushing at his knees, but he only pulled her back. No one saw this
                        little altercation, for very few persons were in the car, and they were
                        attempting to doze.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t,&quot; said Carrie, who was, nevertheless,
                        complying against her will. &quot;Let me go,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;How dare you?&quot; and large tears began to gather in her
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was now fully aroused to the immediate difficulty, and ceased to
                        think of his own situation. He must do something with this girl, or she
                        would cause him trouble. He tried the art of persuasion with all his powers
                        aroused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look here now, Carrie,&quot; he said, &quot;you
                        mustn&apos;t act this way. I didn&apos;t mean to hurt your feelings.
                        I don&apos;t want to do anything to make you feel bad.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; sobbed Carrie, &quot;oh, ohooo!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There, there,&quot; he said, &quot;you mustn&apos;t
                        cry. Won&apos;t you listen to me? Listen to me a minute, and
                        I&apos;ll tell you why I came to do this thing. I couldn&apos;t help
                        it. I assure you I couldn&apos;t. Won&apos;t you
                        listen?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her sobs disturbed him so that he was quite sure she did not hear a word he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you listen?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-303" n="297"/>
                    <p>&quot;No, I won&apos;t,&quot; said Carrie, flashing up.
                        &quot;I want you to take me out of this, or I&apos;ll tell the
                        conductor. I won&apos;t go with you. It&apos;s a shame,&quot;
                        and again sobs of fright cut off her desire for expression.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood listened with some astonishment. He felt that she had just cause
                        for feeling as she did, and yet he wished that he could straighten this
                        thing out quickly. Shortly the conductor would come through for the tickets.
                        He wanted no noise, no trouble of any kind. Before everything he must make
                        her quiet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You couldn&apos;t get out until the train stops
                        again,&quot; said Hurstwood. &quot;It won&apos;t be very long
                        until we reach another station. You can get out then if you want to. I
                        won&apos;t stop you. All I want you to do is to listen a moment.
                        You&apos;ll let me tell you, won&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie seemed not to listen. She only turned her head toward the window,
                        where outside all was black. The train was speeding with steady grace across
                        the fields and through patches of wood. The long whistles came with sad,
                        musical effect as the lonely woodland crossings were approached.</p>
                    <p>Now the conductor entered the car and took up the one or two fares that had
                        been added at Chicago. He approached Hurstwood, who handed out the tickets.
                        Poised as she was to act, Carrie made no move. She did not look about.</p>
                    <p>When the conductor had gone again Hurstwood felt relieved.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re angry at me because I deceived you,&quot; he
                        said. &quot;I didn&apos;t mean to, Carrie. As I live I
                        didn&apos;t. I couldn&apos;t help it. I couldn&apos;t stay away
                        from you after the first time I saw you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was ignoring the last deception as something that might go by the board.
                        He wanted to convince her that his wife could no longer be a factor in their
                        relationship. <pb id="VAA2423-304" n="298"/> The money he had stolen he
                        tried to shut out of his mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t talk to me,&quot; said Carrie, &quot;I hate
                        you. I want you to go away from me. I am going to get out at the very next
                        station.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was in a tremble of excitement and opposition as she spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; he said, &quot;but you&apos;ll hear me
                        out, won&apos;t you? After all you have said about loving me, you might
                        hear me. I don&apos;t want to do you any harm. I&apos;ll give you
                        the money to go back with when you go. I merely want to tell you, Carrie.
                        You can&apos;t stop me from loving you, whatever you may
                        think.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her tenderly, but received no reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think I have deceived you badly, but I haven&apos;t. I
                        didn&apos;t do it willingly. I&apos;m through with my wife. She
                        hasn&apos;t any claims on me. I&apos;ll never see her any more.
                        That&apos;s why I&apos;m here to-night. That&apos;s why I came
                        and got you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You said Charlie was hurt,&quot; said Carrie, savagely.
                        &quot;You deceived me. You&apos;ve been deceiving me all the time,
                        and now you want to force me to run away with you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was so excited that she got up and tried to get by him again. He let her,
                        and she took another seat. Then he followed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t run away from me, Carrie,&quot; he said gently.
                        &quot;Let me explain. If you will only hear me out you will see where I
                        stand. I tell you my wife is nothing to me. She hasn&apos;t been
                        anything for years or I wouldn&apos;t have ever come near you.
                        I&apos;m going to get a divorce just as soon as I can. I&apos;ll
                        never see her again. I&apos;m done with all that. You&apos;re the
                        only person I want. If I can have you I won&apos;t ever think of another
                        woman again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie heard all this in a very ruffled state. It sounded <pb
                            id="VAA2423-305" n="299"/> sincere enough, however, despite all he had
                        done. There was a tenseness in Hurstwood&apos;s voice and manner which
                        could but have some effect. She did not want anything to do with him. He was
                        married, he had deceived her once, and now again, and she thought him
                        terrible. Still there is something in such daring and power which is
                        fascinating to a woman, especially if she can be made to feel that it is all
                        prompted by love of her.</p>
                    <p>The progress of the train was having a great deal to do with the solution of
                        this difficult situation. The speeding wheels and disappearing country put
                        Chicago farther and farther behind. Carrie could fed that she was being
                        borne a long distance offthat the engine was making an almost through run to
                        some distant city. She felt at times as if she could cry out and make such a
                        row that some one would come to her aid; at other times it seemed an almost
                        useless thingso far was she from any aid, no matter what she did. All the
                        while Hurstwood was endeavouring to formulate his plea in such a way that it
                        would strike home and bring her into sympathy with him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was simply put where I didn&apos;t know what else to
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie deigned no suggestion of hearing this.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When I saw you wouldn&apos;t come unless I could marry you, I
                        decided to put everything else behind me and get you to come away with me.
                        I&apos;m going off now to another city. I want to go to Montreal for a
                        while, and then anywhere you want to. We&apos;ll go and live in New
                        York, if you say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not have anything to do with you,&quot; said
                        Carrie. &quot;I want to get off this train. Where are we
                        going?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To Detroit,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Carrie, in a burst of anguish. So distant and
                        definite a point seemed to increase the difficulty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you come along with me?&quot; he said, as if
                        there <pb id="VAA2423-306" n="300"/> was great danger that she would not.
                        &quot;You won&apos;t need to do anything but travel with me.
                        I&apos;ll not trouble you in any way. You can see Montreal and New York,
                        and then if you don&apos;t want to stay you can go back. It will be
                        better than trying to go back to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The first gleam of fairness shone in this proposition for Carrie. It seemed a
                        plausible thing to do, much as she feared his opposition if she tried to
                        carry it out. Montreal and New York! Even now she was speeding toward those
                        great, strange lands, and could see them if she liked. She thought, but made
                        no sign.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood thought he saw a shade of compliance in this. He redoubled his
                        ardour.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Think,&quot; he said, &quot;what I&apos;ve given up. I
                        can&apos;t go back to Chicago any more. I&apos;ve got to stay away
                        and live alone now, if you don&apos;t come with me. You won&apos;t
                        go back on me entirely, will you, Carrie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want you to talk to me,&quot; she answered
                        forcibly.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood kept silent for a while.</p>
                    <p>Carrie felt the train to be slowing down. It was the moment to act if she was
                        to act at all. She stirred uneasily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t think of going, Carrie,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;If you ever cared for me at all, come along and let&apos;s
                        start right. I&apos;ll do whatever you say. I&apos;ll marry you, or
                        I&apos;ll let you go back. Give yourself time to think it over. I
                        wouldn&apos;t have wanted you to come if I hadn&apos;t loved you. I
                        tell you, Carrie, before God, I can&apos;t live without you. I
                        won&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was the tensity of fierceness in the man&apos;s plea which appealed
                        deeply to her sympathies. It was a dissolving fire which was actuating him
                        now. He was loving her too intensely to think of giving her up in this, his
                        hour of distress. He clutched her hand nervously and pressed it with all the
                        force of an appeal.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-307" n="301"/>
                    <p>The train was now all but stopped. It was running by some cars on a side
                        track. Everything outside was dark and dreary. A few sprinkles on the window
                        began to indicate that it was raining. Carrie hung in a quandary, balancing
                        between decision and helplessness. Now the train stopped, and she was
                        listening to his plea. The engine backed a few feet and all was still.</p>
                    <p>She wavered, totally unable to make a move. Minute after minute slipped by
                        and still she hesitated, he pleading.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you let me come back if I want to?&quot; she asked, as if
                        she now had the upper hand and her companion was utterly subdued.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course,&quot; he answered, &quot;you know I
                        will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie only listened as one who has granted a temporary amnesty. She began to
                        feel as if the matter were in her hands entirely.</p>
                    <p>The train was again in rapid motion. Hurstwood changed the subject.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aren&apos;t you very tired?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you let me get you a berth in the
                        sleeper?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head, though for all her distress and his trickery she was
                        beginning to notice what she had always felthis thoughtfulness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; he said, &quot;you will feel so much
                        better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me fix my coat for you, anyway,&quot; and he arose and
                        arranged his light coat in a comfortable position to receive her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There,&quot; he said tenderly, &quot;now see if you
                        can&apos;t rest a little.&quot; He could have kissed her for her
                        compliance. He took his seat beside her and thought a moment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I believe we&apos;re in for a heavy rain,&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So it looks,&quot; said Carrie, whose nerves were quieting
                        under the sound of the rain drops, driven by a gusty <pb id="VAA2423-308"
                            n="302"/> wind, as the train swept on frantically through the shadow to
                        a newer world.</p>
                    <p>The fact that he had in a measure mollified Carrie was a source of
                        satisfaction to Hurstwood, but it furnished only the most temporary relief.
                        Now that her opposition was out of the way, he had all of his time to devote
                        to the consideration of his own error.</p>
                    <p>His condition was bitter in the extreme, for he did not want the miserable
                        sum he had stolen. He did not want to be a thief. That sum or any other
                        could never compensate for the state which he had thus foolishly doffed. It
                        could not give him back his host of friends, his name, his house and family,
                        nor Carrie, as he had meant to have her. He was shut out from Chicagofrom
                        his easy, comfortable state. He had robbed himself of his dignity, his merry
                        meetings, his pleasant evenings. And for what? The more he thought of it the
                        more unbearable it became. He began to think that he would try and restore
                        himself to his old state. He would return the miserable thievings of the
                        night and explain. Perhaps Moy would understand. Perhaps they would forgive
                        him and let him come back.</p>
                    <p>By noontime the train rolled into Detroit and he began to feel exceedingly
                        nervous. The police must be on his track by now. They had probably notified
                        all the police of the big cities, and detectives would be watching for him.
                        He remembered instances in which defaulters had been captured. Consequently,
                        he breathed heavily and paled somewhat. His hands felt as if they must have
                        something to do. He simulated interest in several scenes without which he
                        did not feel. He repeatedly beat his foot upon the floor.</p>
                    <p>Carrie noticed his agitation, but said nothing. She had no idea what it meant
                        or that it was important.</p>
                    <p>He wondered now why he had not asked whether this <pb id="VAA2423-309"
                            n="303"/> train went on through to Montreal or some Canadian point.
                        Perhaps he could have saved time. He jumped up and sought the conductor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Does any part of this train go to Montreal?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, the next sleeper back does.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He would have asked more, but it did not seem wise, so he decided to inquire
                        at the depot.</p>
                    <p>The train rolled into the yards, clanging and puffing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think we had better go right on through to Montreal,&quot; he
                        said to Carrie. &quot;I&apos;ll see what the connections are when we
                        get off.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was exceedingly nervous, but did his best to put on a calm exterior.
                        Carrie only looked at him with large, troubled eyes. She was drifting
                        mentally, unable to say to herself what to do.</p>
                    <p>The train stopped and Hurstwood led the way out. He looked warily around him,
                        pretending to look after Carrie. Seeing nothing that indicated studied
                        observation, he made his way to the ticket office.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The next train for Montreal leaves when?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In twenty minutes,&quot; said the man.</p>
                    <p>He bought two tickets and Pullman berths. Then he hastened back to
                        Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We go right out again,&quot; he said, scarcely noticing that
                        Carrie looked tired and weary.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish I was out of all this,&quot; she exclaimed gloomily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll feel better when we reach Montreal,&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t an earthly thing with me,&quot; said Carrie;
                        &quot;not even a handkerchief.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can buy all you want as soon as you get there,
                        dearest,&quot; he explained. &quot;You can call in a
                        dressmaker.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Now the crier called the train ready and they got on. Hurstwood breathed a
                        sigh of relief as it started. There was a short run to the river, and there
                        they were ferried <pb id="VAA2423-310" n="304"/> over. They had barely
                        pulled the train off the ferry-boat when he settled back with a sigh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It won&apos;t be so very long now,&quot; he said,
                        remembering her in his relief. &quot;We get there the first thing in the
                        morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie scarcely deigned to reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll see if there is a dining-car,&quot; he added.
                        &quot;I&apos;m hungry.&quot;</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE SOLACE OF TRAVEL: THE BOATS OF THE SEA</head>
                    <p>To the untravelled, territory other than their own familiar heath is
                        invariably fascinating. Next to love, it is the one thing which solaces and
                        delights. Things new are too important to be neglected, and mind, which is a
                        mere reflection of sensory impressions, succumbs to the flood of objects.
                        Thus lovers are forgotten, sorrows laid aside, death hidden from view. There
                        is a world of accumulated feeling back of the trite dramatic expression
                        &quot; I am going away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As Carrie looked out upon the flying scenery she almost forgot that she had
                        been tricked into this long journey against her will and that she was
                        without the necessary apparel for travelling. She quite forgot
                        Hurstwood&apos;s presence at times, and looked away to homely farmhouses
                        and cosey cottages in villages with wondering eyes. It was an interesting
                        world to her. Her life had just begun. She did not feel herself defeated at
                        all. Neither was she blasted in hope. The great city held much. Possibly she
                        would come out of bondage into freedomwho knows? Perhaps she would be happy.
                        These thoughts raised her above the level of erring. She was saved in that
                        she was hopeful.</p>
                    <p>The following morning the train pulled safely into Montreal and they stepped
                        down, Hurstwood glad to be out of danger, Carrie wondering at the novel
                        atmosphere of the northern city. Long before, Hurstwood had been here, and
                        now he remembered the name of <pb id="VAA2423-312" n="306"/> the hotel at
                        which he had stopped. As they came out of the main entrance of the depot he
                        heard it called anew by a busman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll go right up and get rooms,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>At the clerk&apos;s office Hurstwood swung the register about while the
                        clerk came forward. He was thinking what name he would put down. With the
                        latter before him he found no time for hesitation. A name he had seen out of
                        the car window came swiftly to him. It was pleasing enough. With an easy
                        hand he wrote, &quot;G. W. Murdock and wife.&quot; It was the
                        largest concession to necessity he felt like making. His initials he could
                        not spare.</p>
                    <p>When they were shown their room Carrie saw at once that he had secured her a
                        lovely chamber.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have a bath there,&quot; said he. &quot;Now you can
                        clean up when you get ready.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie went over and looked out the window, while Hurstwood looked at himself
                        in the glass. He felt dusty and unclean. He had no trunk, no change of
                        linen, not even a hair-brush.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll ring for soap and towels,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;and send you up a hair-brush. Then you can bathe and get ready for
                        breakfast. I&apos;ll go for a shave and come back and get you, and then
                        we&apos;ll go out and look for some clothes for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He smiled good-naturedly as he said this.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>She sat down in one of the rocking-chairs, while Hurstwood waited for the
                        boy, who soon knocked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Soap, towels, and a pitcher of ice-water.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll go now,&quot; he said to Carrie, coming toward
                        her and holding out his hands, but she did not move to take them.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-313" n="307"/>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re not mad at me, are you?&quot; he asked
                        softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no!&quot; she answered, rather indifferently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you care for me at all?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She made no answer, but looked steadily toward the window.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you think you could love me a little?&quot; he
                        pleaded, taking one of her hands, which she endeavoured to draw away.
                        &quot;You once said you did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What made you deceive me so?&quot; asked Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t help it,&quot; he said, &quot;I wanted
                        you too much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You didn&apos;t have any right to want me,&quot; she
                        answered, striking cleanly home.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, well, Carrie,&quot; he answered, &quot;here I am.
                        It&apos;s too late now. Won&apos;t you try and care for me a
                        little.?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked rather worsted in thought as he stood before her.</p>
                    <p>She shook her head negatively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me start all over again. Be my wife from today
                        on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie rose up as if to step away, he holding her hand. Now he slipped his
                        arm about her and she struggled, but in vain. He held her quite close.
                        Instantly there flamed up in his body the all-compelling desire. His
                        affection took an ardent form.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me go,&quot; said Carrie, who was folded close to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you love me?&quot; he said.
                        &quot;Won&apos;t you be mine from now on?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie had never been ill-disposed toward him. Only a moment before she had
                        been listening with some complacency, remembering her old affection for him.
                        He was so handsome, so daring!</p>
                    <p>Now, however, this feeling had changed to one of <pb id="VAA2423-314" n="308"
                        /> opposition, which rose feebly. It mastered her for a moment, and then,
                        held close as she was, began to wane. Something else in her spoke. This man,
                        to whose bosom she was being pressed, was strong; he was passionate, he
                        loved her, and she was alone. If she did not turn to himaccept of his
                        lovewhere else might she go? Her resistance half dissolved in the flood of
                        his strong feeling.</p>
                    <p>She found him lifting her head and looking into her eyes. What magnetism
                        there was she could never know. His many sins, however, were for the moment
                        all forgotten.</p>
                    <p>He pressed her closer and kissed her, and she felt that further opposition
                        was useless.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you marry me?&quot; she asked, forgetting <hi rend="i"
                            >how.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;This very day,&quot; he said, with all delight.</p>
                    <p>Now the hall-boy pounded on the door and he released his hold upon her
                        regretfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You get ready now, will you,&quot; he said, &quot;at
                        once?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll be back in three-quarters of an hour.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie, flushed and excited, moved away as he admitted the boy.</p>
                    <p>Below stairs, he halted in the lobby to look for a barber shop. For the
                        moment, he was in fine feather. His recent victory over Carrie seemed to
                        atone for much he had endured during the last few days. Life seemed worth
                        fighting for. This eastward flight from all things customary and attached
                        seemed as if it might have happiness in store. The storm showed a rainbow at
                        the end of which might be a pot of gold.</p>
                    <p>He was about to cross to a little red-and-white striped bar which was
                        fastened up beside a door when a voice greeted him familiarly. Instantly his
                        heart sank.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-315" n="309"/>
                    <p>&quot;Why, hello, George, old man!&quot; said the voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you doing down here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was already confronted, and recognised his friend Kenny, the
                        stock-broker.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just attending to a little private matter,&quot; he answered,
                        his mind working like a key-board of a telephone station. This man evidently
                        did not knowhe had not read the papers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it seems strange to see you way up here,&quot; said Mr.
                        Kenny genially. &quot;Stopping here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hurstwood uneasily, thinking of his handwriting
                        on the register.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Going to be in town long?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, only a day or so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that so? Had your breakfast?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hurstwood, lying blandly.
                        &quot;I&apos;m just going for a shave.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you come have a drink?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not until afterwards,&quot; said the ex-manager.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll see you later. Are you stopping here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. Kenny, and then, turning the word again,
                        added: &quot;How are things out in Chicago?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;About the same as usual,&quot; said Hurstwood, smiling
                        genially.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wife with you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I must one more of you today. I&apos;m just going in here
                        for breakfast. Come in when you&apos;re through.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will,&quot; said Hursttwood, moving away. The whole
                        conversation was a trial to him. It seemed to add complications with every
                        word. This man called up a thousand memories. He represented everything he
                        had left. Chicago, his wife, the elegant resortall these were in his
                        greeting and inquiries. And here he <pb id="VAA2423-316" n="310"/> was in
                        this same hotel expecting to confer with him, unquestionably waiting to have
                        a good time with him. All at once the Chicago papers would arrive. The local
                        papers would have accounts in them this very day. He forgot his triumph with
                        Carrie in the possibility of soon being known for what he was, in this
                        man&apos;s eyes, a safe-breaker. He could have groaned as he went into
                        the barber shop. He decided to escape and seek a more secluded hotel.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, when he came out he was glad to see the lobby clear, and
                        hastened toward the stairs. He would get Carrie and go out by the
                        ladies&apos; entrance. They would have breakfast in some more
                        inconspicuous place.</p>
                    <p>Across the lobby, however, another individual was surveying him. He was of a
                        commonplace Irish type, small of stature, cheaply dressed, and with a head
                        that seemed a smaller edition of some huge ward politician&apos;s. This
                        individual had been evidently talking with the clerk, but now he surveyed
                        the ex-manager keenly.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood felt the long-range examination and recognised the type.
                        Instinctively he felt that the than was a detectivethat he was being
                        watched. He hurried across, pretending not to notice, but in his mind was a
                        world of thoughts. What would happen now? What could these people do? He
                        began to trouble concerning the extradition laws. He did not understand them
                        absolutely. Perhaps he could be arrested. Oh, if Carrie should find out!
                        Montreal was too warm for him. He began to long to be out of it.</p>
                    <p>Carrie had bathed and was waiting when he arrived. She looked refreshedmore
                        delightful than were, but reserved. Since he had gone she had resumed
                        some-what of her cold attitude towards him. Love was not blazing in her
                        heart. He felt it, and his troubles seemed <pb id="VAA2423-317" n="311"/>
                        increased. He could not take her in his arms; he did not even try. Something
                        about her forbade it. In part his opinion was the result of his own
                        experiences and reflections below stairs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re ready, are you?&quot; he said kindly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll go out for breakfast. This place down here
                        doesn&apos;t appeal to me very much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>They went out, and at the corner the commonplace Irish individual was
                        standing, eyeing hint. Hurst-wood could scarcely refrain from showing that
                        he knew of this chap&apos;s presence. The insolence in the
                        fellow&apos;s eye was galling. Still they passed, and he explained to
                        Carrie concerning the city. Another restaurant was not long in showing
                        itself, and here they entered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a queer town this is,&quot; said Carrie, who marvelled at
                        it solely because it was not like Chicago.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t as lively as Chicago,&quot; said
                        Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you like it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Carrie, whose feelings were already localised in
                        the great Western city.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it isn&apos;t as interesting,&quot; said
                        Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s here?&quot; asked Carrie, wondering at his
                        choosing to visit this town.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing much,&quot; returned Hurstwood. &quot;It&apos;s
                        quite a resort. There&apos;s some pretty scenery about
                        here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie listened, but with a feeling of unrest. There was much about her
                        situation which destroyed the possibility of appreciation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We won&apos;t stay here long,&quot; said Hurstwood, who was
                        now really glad to note her dissatisfaction. &quot;You pick out your
                        clothes as soon as breakfast is over and we&apos;ll run down to New York
                        soon. You&apos;ll like that. It&apos;s a lot more like a city than
                        any place outside Chicago.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-318" n="312"/>
                    <p>He was really planning to slip out and away. He would see what these
                        detectives would dowhat move his employers at Chicago would makethee he
                        would slip awaydown to New York, where it was easy to hide. He knew enough
                        about that city to know that its mysteries and possibilities of
                        mystification were infinite.</p>
                    <p>The more he thought, however, the more wretched his situation became. He saw
                        that getting here did not exactly clear up the ground. The firm would
                        probably employ detectives to watch himPinkerton men or agents of Mooney and
                        Boland. They might arrest him the moment he tried to leave Canada. So he
                        might be compelled to remain here months, and in what a state!</p>
                    <p>Back at the hotel Hurstwood was anxious and yet fearful to see the morning
                        papers. He wanted to know how far the news of his criminal deed had spread.
                        So he told Carrie he would be up in a few moments, and went to secure and
                        scan the dailies. No familiar or suspicious faces were about, and yet he did
                        not like reading in the lobby, so he sought the main parlour on the floor
                        above and, seated by a window there, looked them over. Very little was given
                        to his crime, but it was there, several &quot;sticks&quot; in all,
                        among all the riffraff of telegraphed murders, accidents, marriages, and
                        other news. He wished, half sadly, that he could undo it all. Every moment
                        of his time in this far-off abode of safety but added to his feeling that he
                        had made a great mistake. There could have been an easier way out if he had
                        only known.</p>
                    <p>He left the papers before going to the room, thinking thus to keep them out
                        of the hands of Carrie.</p>
                    <p>Well, how are you feeling?&quot; he asked of her. She was engaged in
                        looking out of the window.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-319" n="313"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, all right,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>He came over, and was about to begin a conversation with her, when a knock
                        came at their door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe it&apos;s one of my parcels,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood opened the door, outside of which stood the individual whom he had
                        so thoroughly suspected.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re Mr. Hurstwood, are you?&quot; said the latter,
                        with a volume of affected shrewdness and assurance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hurstwood calmly. He knew the type so
                        thoroughly that some of his old familiar indifference to it returned. Such
                        men as these were of the lowest stratum welcomed at the resort. He stepped
                        out and closed the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you know what I am here for, don&apos;t you?&quot;
                        said the man confidentially.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can guess,&quot; said Hurstwood softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, do you intend to try and keep the money?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s my affair,&quot; said Hurstwood grimily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can&apos;t do it, you know,&quot; said the detective,
                        eyeing him coolly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look here, my man,&quot; said Hurstwood authoritatively,
                        &quot;you don&apos;t understand anything about this case, and I
                        can&apos;t explain to you. Whatever I intend to do I&apos;ll do
                        without advice from the outside. You&apos;ll have to excuse
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, now, there&apos;s no use of your talking that
                        way,&quot; said the man, &quot;when you&apos;re in the hands of
                        the police. We can make a lot of trouble for you if we want to.
                        You&apos;re not registered right in this house, you haven&apos;t got
                        your wife with you, and the newspapers don&apos;t know you&apos;re
                        here yet. You might as well be reasonable.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you want to know?&quot; asked Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whether you&apos;re going to send back that money or
                        not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood paused and studied the floor.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-320" n="314"/>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s no use explaining to you about this,&quot; he
                        said at last. &quot;There&apos;s no use of your asking me.
                        I&apos;m no fool, you know. I know just what you can do and what you
                        can&apos;t. You can create a lot of trouble if you want to. I know that
                        all right, but it won&apos;t help you to get the money. Now,
                        I&apos;ve made up my mind what to do. I&apos;ve already written
                        Fitzgerald and Moy, so there&apos;s nothing I can say. You wait until
                        you hear more from them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>All the time he had been talking he had been moving away from the door, down
                        the corridor, out of the hearing of Carrie. They were now near the end where
                        the corridor opened into the large general parlour.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You won&apos;t give it up?&quot; said the man.</p>
                    <p>The words irritated Hurstwood greatly. Hot blood poured into his brain. Many
                        thoughts formulated themselves. He was no thief. He didn&apos;t want the
                        money. If he could only explain to Fitzgerald and Moy, maybe it would be all
                        right again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;See here,&quot; he said, &quot;there&apos;s no use my
                        talking about this at all. I respect your power all right, but I&apos;ll
                        have to deal with the people who know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you can&apos;t get out of Canada with it,&quot; said
                        theman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to get out,&quot; said Hurstwood.
                        &quot;When I get ready there&apos;ll be nothing to stop me
                        for.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned back, and the detective watched him closely. It scented an
                        intolerable thing. Still he went on and into the room.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who was it?&quot; asked Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A friend of mine from Chicago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The whole of this conversation was such a shock that, coming as it did after
                        all the other worry of the past week, it sufficed to induce a sleep gloom
                        and moral revulsion in Hurstwood. What hurt him most was the <pb
                            id="VAA2423-321" n="315"/> fact that he was being pursued as a thief. He
                        began to see the nature of that social injustice which sees but one
                        sideoften but a single point in a long tragedy. All the newspapers noted but
                        one thing, his taking the money. How and wherefore were but indifferently
                        dealt with. All the complications which led up to it were unknown. He was
                        accused without being understood.</p>
                    <p>Sitting in his room with Carrie the same day, he decided to send the money
                        back. He would write Fitzgerald and Moy, explain all, and then send it by
                        express. Maybe they would forgive him. Perhaps they would ask him back. He
                        would make good the false statement he had made about writing them. Then he
                        would leave this peculiar town.</p>
                    <p>For an hour he thought over this plausible statement of the tangle. He wanted
                        to tell them about his wife, but couldn&apos;t. He finally narrowed it
                        down to an assertion that he was light-headed from entertaining friends, had
                        found the safe open, and having gone so far as to take the money out, had
                        accidentally closed it. This act he regretted very much. He was sorry he had
                        put them to so much trouble. He would undo what he could by sending the
                        money backthe major portion of it. The remainder he would pay up as soon as
                        he could. Was there any possibility of his being restored? This he only
                        hinted at.</p>
                    <p>The troubled state of the man&apos;s mind may be judged by the very
                        construction of this letter. For the nonce he forgot what a painful thing it
                        would be to resume his old place, even if it were given him. He forgot that
                        he had severed himself from the past as by a sword, and that if he did
                        manage to in some way reunite himself with it, the jagged line of separation
                        and reunion would always show. He was always forgetting something <pb
                            id="VAA2423-322" n="316"/> his wife, Carrie, his need of money, present
                        situation, or somethingand so did not reason clearly. Nevertheless, he sent
                        the letter, waiting a reply before sending the money.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, he accepted his present situation with Carrie, getting what joy
                        out of it he could.</p>
                    <p>Out came the sun by noon, and poured a golden flood through their open
                        windows. Sparrows were twittering. There were laughter and song in the air.
                        Hurstwood could not keep his eyes from Carrie. She seemed the one ray of
                        sunshine in all his trouble. Oh, if she would only love him whollyonly throw
                        her arms around him in the blissful spirit in which he had seen her in the
                        little park in Chicagohow happy he would be! It would repay him; it would
                        show hint that he had not lost all. He would not care.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Carrie,&quot; he said, getting tip once and coining over to
                        her, &quot;are you going to stay with me from now on?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him quizzically, but melted with sympathy as the value of the
                        look upon his face forced itself upon her. It was love now, keen and
                        stronglove enhanced by difficulty and worry. She could not help smiling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me be everything to you from now on,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t stake me worry any more. I&apos;ll be true to
                        you. We&apos;ll go to New York and get a nice flat. I&apos;ll go
                        into business again, and we&apos;ll be happy. Won&apos;t you be
                        mine?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie listened quite solemnly. There was no great passion in her, but the
                        drift of things and this man&apos;s proximity created a semblance of
                        affection. She felt rather sorry for hima sorrow born of what had only
                        recently been a great admiration. True love she had never felt for him. She
                        would have known as much if she could have analysed her feelings, but this
                        thing <pb id="VAA2423-323" n="317"/> which she now felt aroused by his great
                        feeling broke down the barriers between them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll stay with me, won&apos;t you?&quot; he
                        asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, nodding her head.</p>
                    <p>He gathered her to himself, imprinting kisses upon her lips and cheeks.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must marry me, though,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll get a license to-day,&quot; he answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Under a new name,&quot; he answered. &quot;I&apos;ll
                        take a new name and live a new life. From, now on I&apos;m
                        Murdock.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, don&apos;t take that name,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t like it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what shall I take?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, anything, only don&apos;t take that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He thought a while, still keeping his arms about her, and then said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;How would Wheeler do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s all right,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, Wheeler,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ll get
                        the license this afternoon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They were married by a Baptist minister, the first divine they found
                        convenient.</p>
                    <p>At last the Chicago firm answered. It was by Mr. Moy&apos;s dictation. He
                        was astonished that Hurstwood had done this; very sorry that it had come
                        about as it had. If the money were returned, they would not trouble to
                        prosecute him, as they really bore him no ill-will. As for his returning, or
                        their restoring him to his former position, they had not quite decided what
                        the effect of it would be. They would think it over and correspond with him
                        later, possibly, after a little time, and so on.</p>
                    <p>The sum and substance of it was that there was no <pb id="VAA2423-324"
                            n="318"/> hope, and they wanted the money with the least trouble
                        possible. Hurstwood read his doom. He decided to pay $9,500 to the agent
                        whom they said they would send. keeping $1,300 for his own use. He
                        telegraphed his acquiescence, explained to the representative who called at
                        the hotel the same day, took a certificate of payment, and told Carrie to
                        pack her trunk. He was slightly depressed over this newest move at the time
                        he began to stake it, but eventually restored himself. He feared that even
                        yet he might be seized and taken back, so he tried to conceal his movements,
                        but it was scarcely possible. He ordered Carrie&apos;s trunk sent to the
                        depot, where he had it sent by express to New York. No one seemed to be
                        observing hint, but he left at night. He was greatly agitated lest at the
                        first station across the border or at the depot in New York there should be
                        waiting for hint an officer of the law.</p>
                    <p>Carrie, ignorant of his theft and his fears, enjoyed the entry into the
                        latter city in the morning. The round green hills sentinelling the broad,
                        expansive bosom of the Hudson held her attention by their beauty as the
                        train followed the line of the stream. She had heard of the Hudson River,
                        the great city of New York, and now she looked out, filling her mind with
                        the wonder of it.</p>
                    <p>As the train turned east at Spuyten Duyvil and followed the east bank of the
                        Harlem River, Hurstwood nervously called her attention to the fact that they
                        were on the edge of the city. After her experience with Chicago, she
                        expected long lines of carsa great highway of tracksand noted the
                        difference. The sight of a few boats in the Harlem and more in the East
                        River tickled her young heart. It was the first sign of the great sea. Next
                        came a plain street with five-story brick flats, and then the train plunged
                        into the tunnel.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-325" n="319"/>
                    <p>&quot;Grand Central Station!&quot; called the trainman, as, after a
                        few minutes of darkness and smoke, daylight reappeared. Hurstwood arose and
                        gathered up his small grip. He was screwed up to the highest tension. With
                        Carrie he waited at the door and then dismounted. No one approached him, but
                        he glanced furtively to and fro as he made for the street entrance. So
                        excited was he that he forgot all about Carrie, who fell behind, wondering
                        at his self-absorption: As he passed through the depot proper the strain
                        reached its climax and began to wane. All at once he was on the sidewalk,
                        and none but cabmen hailed him. He heaved a great breath and turned,
                        remembering Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you were going to run off and leave me,&quot; she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was trying to remember which car takes us to the
                        Gilsey,&quot; he answered.</p>
                    <p>Carrie hardly heard him, so interested was she in the busy scene.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How large is New York?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, a million or sure.&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>He looked around and hailed a cab, but he did so in a changed way.</p>
                    <p>For the first time in years the thought that he must count these little
                        expenses flashed through his mind. It was a disagreeable thing.</p>
                    <p>He decided he would lose no time living in hotels but would rent it that.
                        Accordingly he told Carrie, and she agreed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll look to-day, if you want to.&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly he thought of his experience in Montreal. At the more important
                        hotels he would be certain to meet Chicagoans whom he knew. He stood up and
                        spoke to the driver.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take me to the Belford,&quot; he said, knowing it to be <pb
                            id="VAA2423-326" n="320"/> less frequented by those whom he knew. Then
                        he sat down.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is the residence part?&quot; asked Carrie, who did not
                        take the tall five-story walls on either hand to be the abodes of
                        families.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everywhere,&quot; said Hurstwood, who knew the city fairly
                        well. &quot;There are no lawns in New York. All these are
                        houses.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, I don&apos;t like it,&quot; said Carrie, who
                        was coming to have a few opinions of her own.</p>

                    <p>Whatever a man like Hurstwood could be in Chicago, it is very evident that he
                        would be but an inconspicuous drop in an ocean like New York. In Chicago,
                        whose population still ranged about 500,000, millionaires were not numerous.
                        The rich had not become so conspicuously rich as to drown all moderate
                        incomes in obscurity. The attention of the inhabitants was not so distracted
                        by local celebrities in the dramatic, artistic, social, and religious fields
                        as to shut the well-positioned man from view. In Chicago the two roads to
                        distinction were politics and trade. In New York the roads were any one of a
                        half-hundred, and each had been diligently pursued by hundreds, so that
                        celebrities were numerous. The sea was already full of whales. A common fish
                        must needs disappear wholly from viewremain unseen. In other words,
                        Hurstwood was nothing.</p>
                    <p>There is a more subtle result of such a situation as this, which, though not
                        always taken into account, produces the tragedies of the world. The great
                        create an atmosphere which reacts badly upon the small. This atmosphere is
                        easily and quickly felt. Walk among the magnificent residences, the splendid
                        equipages, the gilded shops, restaurants, resorts of all kinds; scent the
                        flowers, the silks, the wines; drink of the laughter springing from the such
                        of luxurious content, of the <pb id="VAA2423-328" n="322"/> glances which
                        gleam like light from defiant spears; feel the quality of the smiles which
                        cut like glistening swords and of strides born of place, and you shall know
                        of what is the atmosphere of the high and mighty. Little use to argue that
                        of such is not the kingdom of greatness, but so long as the world is
                        attracted by this and the human heart views this as the one desirable realm
                        which it must attain, so long, to that heart, will this remain the realm of
                        greatness. So long, also, will the atmosphere of this realm work its
                        desperate results in the soul of man. It is like a chemical reagent. One day
                        of it, like one drop of the other, will so affect and discolour the views,
                        the aims, the desire of the mind, that it will thereafter remain forever
                        dyed. A day of it to the untried mind is like opium to the untried body. A
                        craving is set up which, if gratified, shall eternally result in dreams and
                        death. Aye! dreams unfulfilledgnawing, luring, idle phantoms which beckon
                        and lead, beckon and lead, until death and dissolution dissolve their power
                        and restore us blind to nature&apos;s heart.</p>
                    <p>A man of Hurstwood&apos;s age and temperament is not subject to the
                        illusions and burning desires of youth, but neither has he the strength of
                        hope which gushes as a fountain in the heart of youth. Such an atmosphere
                        could not incite in him the cravings of a boy of eighteen, but in so far as
                        they were excited, the lack of hope made them proportionately bitter. He
                        could not fail to notice the signs of affluence and luxury on every hand. He
                        had been to New York, before and knew the resources of its folly. In part it
                        was an awesome place to him, for here gathered all that he most respected on
                        this earthwealth, place, and fame. The majority of the celebrities with whom
                        he had tipped glasses in his clay as manager hailed from this self-centred
                        and populous spot. The most inviting stories of pleasure and luxury <pb
                            id="VAA2423-329" n="323"/> had been told of places and individuals here.
                        He knew, it to be true that unconsciously he was brushing elbows with
                        fortune the livelong day; that a hundred or five hundred thousand gave no
                        one the privilege of living more than comfortably in so wealthy a place.
                        Fashion and pomp required more ample sums, so that the poor man was nowhere.
                        All this he realised, now, quits sharply, as he faced the city, cut off from
                        his friends, despoiled of his modest fortune, and even his name, and forced
                        to begin the battle for place and comfort all over again. He was not old,
                        but he was not so dull but that he could feel he soon would be. Of a sudden,
                        then, this show of fine clothes, place, and power took on peculiar
                        significance. It was emphasised by contrast with his own distressing
                        state.</p>
                    <p>And it was distressing. He soon found that freedom from fear of arrest was
                        not the <hi rend="i">sine gua non</hi> of his existence. That danger
                        dissolved, the next necessity became the grievous thing. The paltry sum of
                        thirteen hundred and some odd dollars set against the need of rent,
                        clothing, food, and pleasure for years to come was a spectacle little
                        calculated to induce peace of mind in one who had been accustomed to spend
                        five times that sum in the course of a year. He thought upon the subject
                        rather actively the first few days he was in Knee York, and decided that he
                        must act quickly. As a consequence, he consulted the business opportunities
                        advertised in the morning papers and began investigations on his own
                        account.</p>
                    <p>That was not before he had become settled, however. Carrie and he went
                        looking for a fiat, as arranged, and found one in Seventy-eighth Street near
                        Amsterdam Avenue. It was a five-story building, and their flat was on the
                        third floor. Owing to the fact that the street was not yet built up solidly,
                        it <pb id="VAA2423-330" n="324"/> was possible to see east to the green tops
                        of the trees in Central Park and west to the broad waters of the Hudson, a
                        glimpse of which was to be had out of the west windows. For the privilege of
                        six rooms and a bath, running in a straight line, they were compelled to pay
                        thirty-five dollars a monthan average, and yet exorbitant, rent for a home
                        at the time. Carrie noticed the difference between the size of the rooms
                        here and in Chicago and mentioned it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll not find anything better, dear,&quot; said
                        Hurstwood, &quot;unless you go into one of the old-fashioned houses, and
                        then you won&apos;t have any of these conveniences.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie picked out the new abode because of its newness and bright wood-work.
                        It was one of the very new ones supplied with steam heat, which was a great
                        advantage. The stationary range, hot and cold water, dumb-waiter, speaking
                        tubes, and call-bell for the janitor pleased her very much. She had enough
                        of the instincts of a housewife to take great satisfaction in these
                        things.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood made arrangement with one of the instalment houses whereby they
                        furnished the flat complete and accepted fifty dollars down and ten dollars
                        a month. He then had a little plate, bearing the name G. W. Wheeler, made,
                        which he placed on his letter-box in the hall. It sounded exceedingly odd to
                        Carrie to be called Mrs. Wheeler by the janitor, but in time she became used
                        to it and looked upon the name as her own.</p>
                    <p>These house details settled, Hurstwood visited some of the advertised
                        opportunities to purchase an interest in some flourishing down-town bar.
                        After the palatial resort in Adams Street, he could not stomach the
                        commonplace saloons which he found advertised. He lost <pb id="VAA2423-331"
                            n="325"/> a number of days looking up these and finding them
                        disagreeable. He did, however, gain considerable knowledge by talking, for
                        he discovered the influence of Tammany Hall and the value of standing in
                        with the police. The most profitable and flourishing places he found to be
                        those which conducted anything but a legitimate business, such as that
                        controlled by Fitzgerald and Moy. Elegant back rooms and private drinking
                        booths on the second floor were usually adjuncts of very profitable places.
                        He saw by portly keepers, whose shirt fronts shone with large diamonds, and
                        whose clothes were properly cut, that the liquor business here, as
                        elsewhere, yielded the same golden profit.</p>
                    <p>At last he found an individual who had a resort in Warren Street, which
                        seemed an excellent venture. It was fairly well-appearing and susceptible of
                        improvement. The owner claimed the business to be excellent, and it
                        certainly looked so.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We deal with a very good class of people,&quot; he told
                        Hurstwood. &quot;Merchants, salesmen, and professionals. It&apos;s a
                        well-dressed class. No bums. We don&apos;t allow &apos;em in the
                        place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood listened to the cash-register ring, and watched the trade for a
                        while.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s profitable enough for two, is it?&quot; he
                        asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can see for yourself if you&apos;re any judge of the liquor
                        trade,&quot; said the owner. &quot;This is only one of the two
                        places I have. The other is down in Nassau Street. I can&apos;t tend to
                        them both alone. If I had some one who knew the business thoroughly I
                        wouldn&apos;t mind sharing with him in this one and letting him manage
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve had experience enough,&quot; said Hurstwood
                        blandly, but he felt a little diffident about referring to Fitzgerald and
                        Moy.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-332" n="326"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you can suit yourself, MR. Wheeler,&quot; said the
                        proprietor.</p>
                    <p>He only offered a third interest in the stock, fixtures, and good-will, and
                        this in return for a thousand dollars and managerial ability on the part of
                        the one who should come in. There was no property involved, because the
                        owner of the saloon merely rented from an estate.</p>
                    <p>The offer was genuine enough, but it was a question with Hurstwood whether a
                        third interest in that locality could be made to yield one hundred and fifty
                        dollars a month, which he figured he must have in order to meet the ordinary
                        family expenses and be comfortable. It was not the time, however, after many
                        failures to find what he wanted, to hesitate. It looked as though a third
                        would pay a hundred a month now. By judicious management and improvement, it
                        might be made to pay more. Accordingly he agreed to enter into partnership,
                        and made over his thousand dollars, preparing to enter the next day.</p>
                    <p>His first inclination was to be elated, and he confided to Carrie that he
                        thought he had made an excellent arrangement. Time, however, introduced food
                        for reflection. He found his partner to be very disagreeable. Frequently he
                        was the worse for liquor, which made him surly. This was the last thing
                        which Hurstwood was used to in business. Besides, the business varied. It
                        was nothing like the class of patronage which he had enjoyed in Chicago. He
                        found that it would take a long time to make friends. These people hurried
                        in and out without seeking the pleasures of friendship. It was no gathering
                        or lounging place. Whole days and weeks passed without one such hearty
                        greeting as he had been wont to enjoy every day in Chicago.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-333" n="327"/>
                    <p>For another thing, Hurstwood missed the celebrities those well-dressed, <hi
                            rend="i">lite</hi> individuals who lend grace to the average bars and
                        bring news from far-off and exclusive circles. He did not see one such in a
                        month. Evenings, when still at his post, he would occasionally read in the
                        evening papers incidents concerning celebrities whom he knewwhom he had
                        drunk a glass with many a time. They would visit a bar like Fitzgerald and
                        Moy&apos;s in Chicago, or the Hoffman House, uptown, but he knew that he
                        would never see them down here.</p>
                    <p>Again, the business did not pay as well as he thought. It increased a little,
                        but he found he would have to watch his household expenses, which was
                        humiliating.</p>
                    <p>In the very beginning it was a delight to go home late at night, as he did,
                        and find Carrie. He managed to run up and take dinner with her between six
                        and seven, and to remain home until nine o&apos;clock in the morning,
                        but the novelty of this waned after a time, and he began to feel the drag of
                        his duties.</p>
                    <p>The first month had scarcely passed before Carrie said in a very natural way:
                        &quot;I think I&apos;ll go down this week and buy a
                        dress.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What kind?&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, something for street wear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; he answered, smiling, although he noted
                        mentally that it would be more agreeable to his finances if she
                        didn&apos;t. Nothing was said about it the next day, but the following
                        morning he asked:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you done anything about your dress?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not yet,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>He paused a few moments, as if in thought, and then said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would you mind putting it off a few days?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-334" n="328"/>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Carrie, who did not catch the drift of his
                        remarks. She had never thought of him in connection with money troubles
                        before. &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll tell you,&quot; said Hurstwood.
                        &quot;This investment of mine is taking a lot of money just now. I
                        expect to get it all back shortly, but just at present I am running
                        close.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; answered Carrie. &quot;Why, certainly, dear. Why
                        didn&apos;t you tell me before?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It wasn&apos;t necessary,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>For all her acquiescence, there was something about the way Hurstwood spoke
                        which reminded Carrie of Drouet and his little deal which he was always
                        about to put through. It was only the thought of a second, but it was a
                        beginning. It was something new in her thinking of Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>Other things followed from time to time, little things of the same sort,
                        which in their cumulative effect were eventually equal to a full revelation.
                        Carrie was not together without coming to an understanding of one another.
                        The mental difficulties of an individual reveal themselves whether he
                        voluntarily confesses them or not. Trouble gets in the air and contributes
                        gloom, which speaks for itself. Hurstwood dressed as nicely as usual, but
                        they were the same clothes he had in Canada. Carrie noticed that he did not
                        install a large wardrobe, though his own was anything but large. She
                        noticed, also, that he did not suggest many amusements, said nothing about
                        the food, seemed concerned about his business. This was not the easy
                        Hurstwood of Chicagonot the liberal, opulent Hurstwood she had known. The
                        change was too obvious to escape detection.</p>
                    <p>In time she began to feel that a change had come <pb id="VAA2423-335" n="329"
                        /> about, and that she was not in his confidence. He was evidently secretive
                        and kept his own counsel. She found herself asking him questions about
                        little things. This is a disagreeable state to a woman. Great love makes it
                        seem reasonable, sometimes plausible, but never satisfactory. Where great
                        love is not, a more definite and less satisfactory conclusion is
                        reached.</p>
                    <p>As for Hurstwood, he was making a great fight against the difficulties of a
                        changed condition. He was too shrewd not to realise the tremendous mistake
                        he had made, and appreciate that he had done well in getting where he was,
                        and yet he could not help contrasting his present state with his former,
                        hour after hour, and day, after day.</p>
                    <p>Besides, he had the disagreeable fear of meeting old-time friends, ever since
                        one such encounter which he made shortly after his arrival in the city. It
                        was in Broadway that he saw a man approaching him whom he knew. There was no
                        time for simulating non-recognition. The exchange of glances had been too
                        sharp, the knowledge of each other too apparent. So the friend, a buyer for
                        one of the Chicago wholesale houses, felt, perforce, the necessity of
                        stopping.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How are you?&quot; he said, extending his hand with an evident
                        mixture of feeling and a lack of plausible interest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Hurstwood, equally embarrassed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How is it with you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right; I&apos;m down here doing a little buying. Are you
                        located here now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hurstwood, &quot;I have a place down in
                        Warren Street.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that so?&quot; said the friend. &quot;Glad to hear it.
                        I&apos;ll come down and see you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-336" n="330"/>
                    <p>&quot;So long,&quot; said the other, smiling affably and going
                        on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He never asked for my number,&quot; thought Hurstwood;
                        &quot;he wouldn&apos;t think of coming.&quot; He wiped his
                        forehead, which had grown damp, and hoped sincerely he would meet no one
                        else.</p>
                    <p>These things told upon his good-nature, such as it was. His one hope was that
                        things would change for the better in a money way. He had Carrie. His
                        furniture was being paid for. He was maintaining his position. As for
                        Carrie, the amusements he could give her would have to do for the present.
                        He could probably keep up his pretensions sufficiently long without exposure
                        to make good, and then all would be well. He failed therein to take account
                        of the frailties of human naturethe difficulties of matrimonial life. Carrie
                        was young. With him and with her varying mental states were common. At any
                        moment the extremes of feeling might be anti-polarised at the dinner table.
                        This often happens in the best regulated families. Little things brought out
                        on such occasions need great love to obliterate them afterward. Where that
                        is not, both parties count two and two and make a problem after a while.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">A PET OF GOOD FORTUNE: BROADWAY FLAUNTS ITS JOYS</head>
                    <p>The effect of the city and his own situation on Hurstwood was paralleled in
                        the case of Carrie, who accepted the things which fortune provided with the
                        most genial good-nature. New York, despite her first expression of
                        disapproval, soon interested her exceedingly. Its clear atmosphere, more
                        populous thoroughfares, and peculiar indifference struck her forcibly. She
                        had never seen such a little flat as hers, and yet it soon enlisted her
                        affection. The new furniture made an excellent showing, the sideboard which
                        Hurstwood himself arranged gleamed brightly. The furniture for each room was
                        appropriate, and in the so-called parlour, or front room, was installed a
                        piano, because Carrie said she would like to learn to play. She kept a
                        servant and developed rapidly in household tactics and information. For the
                        first time in her life she felt settled, and somewhat justified in the eyes
                        of society as she conceived of it. Her thoughts were merry and innocent
                        enough. For a long while she concerned herself over the arrangement of New
                        York flats, and wondered at ten families living in one building and all
                        remaining strange and indifferent to each other. She also marvelled at the
                        whistles of the hundreds of vessels in the harbourthe long, low cries of the
                        Sound steamers and ferry-boats when fog was on. The mere fact that these
                        things spoke from the sea made them wonderful. She <pb id="VAA2423-338"
                            n="332"/> looked much at what she could see of the Hudson from her west
                        windows and of the great city building up rapidly on either hand. It was
                        much to ponder over, and sufficed to entertain her for more than a year
                        without becoming stale.</p>
                    <p>For another thing, Hurstwood was exceedingly interesting in his affection for
                        her. Troubled as he was, he never exposed his difficulties to her. He
                        carried himself with the same self-important air, took his new state with
                        easy familiarity, and rejoiced in Carrie&apos;s proclivities and
                        successes. Each evening he arrived promptly to dinner, and found the little
                        dining-room a most inviting spectacle. In a way, the smallness of the room
                        added to its luxury. It looked full and replete. The white-covered table was
                        arrayed with pretty dishes and lighted with a four-armed candelabra, each
                        light of which was topped with a red shade. Between Carrie and the girl the
                        steaks and chops came out all right, and canned goods did the rest for a
                        while. Carrie studied the art of making biscuit, and soon reached the stage
                        where she could show a plate of light, palatable morsels for her labour.</p>
                    <p>In this manner the second, third, and fourth months passed. Winter came, and
                        with it a feeling that indoors was best, so that the attending of theatres
                        was not much talked of. Hurstwood made great efforts to meet all
                        expenditures without a show of feeling one way or the other. He pretended
                        that he was reinvesting his money in strengthening the business for greater
                        ends in the future. He contented himself with a very moderate allowance of
                        personal apparel, and rarely suggested anything for Carrie. Thus the first
                        winter passed.</p>
                    <p>In the second year, the business which Hurstwood managed did increase
                        somewhat. He got out of it <pb id="VAA2423-339" n="333"/> regularly the $150
                        per month which he had anticipated. Unfortunately, by this time Carrie had
                        reached certain conclusions, and he had scraped up a few acquaintances.</p>
                    <p>Being of a passive and receptive rather than an active and aggressive nature,
                        Carrie accepted the situation. Her state seemed satisfactory enough. Once in
                        a while they would go to a theatre together, occasionally in season to the
                        beaches and different points about the city, but they picked up no
                        acquaintances. Hurstwood naturally abandoned his show of fine manners with
                        her and modified his attitude to one of easy familiarity. There were no
                        misunderstandings, no apparent differences of opinion. In fact, without
                        money or visiting friends, he led a life which could neither arouse jealousy
                        nor comment. Carrie rather sympathised with his efforts and thought nothing
                        upon her lack of entertainment such as she had enjoyed in Chicago. New York
                        as a corporate entity and her flat temporarily seemed sufficient.</p>
                    <p>However, as Hurstwood&apos;s business increased, he, as stated, began to
                        pick up acquaintances. He also began to allow himself more clothes. He
                        convinced himself that his home life was very precious to him, but allowed
                        that he could occasionally stay away from dinner. The first time he did this
                        he sent a message saying that he would be detained. Carrie ate alone, and
                        wished that it might not happen again. The second time, also, he sent word,
                        but at the last moment. The third time he forgot entirely and explained
                        afterwards. These events were months apart, each.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where were you, George?&quot; asked Carrie, after the first
                        absence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tied up at the office,&quot; he said genially. &quot;There
                        were some accounts I had to straighten.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-340" n="334"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry you couldn&apos;t get home,&quot; she
                        said kindly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was fixing to have such a nice dinner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The second time he gave a similar excuse, but the third time the feeling
                        about it in Carrie&apos;s mind was a little bit out of the ordinary.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t get home,&quot; he said, when he came in
                        later in the evening, &quot;I was so busy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Couldn&apos;t you have sent me word?&quot; asked
                        Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I meant to,&quot; he said, &quot;but you know I forgot it
                        until it was too late to do any good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I had such a good dinner!&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>Now, it so happened that from his observations of Carrie he began to imagine
                        that she was of the thoroughly domestic type of mind. He really thought,
                        after a year, that her chief expression in life was finding its natural
                        channel in household duties. Notwithstanding the fact that he had observed
                        her act in Chicago, and that during the past year he had only seen her
                        limited in her relations to her flat and him by conditions which he made,
                        and that she had not gained any friends or associates, he drew this peculiar
                        conclusion. With it came a feeling of satisfaction in having a wife who
                        could thus be content, and this satisfaction worked its natural result. That
                        is, since he imagined he saw her satisfied, he felt called upon to give only
                        that which contributed to such satisfaction. He supplied the furniture, the
                        decorations, the food, and the necessary clothing. Thoughts of entertaining
                        her, leading her out into the shine and show of life, grew less and less. He
                        felt attracted to the outer world, but did not think she would care to go
                        along. Once he went to the theatre alone. Another time he joined a couple of
                        his new friends at an evening game of poker. Since his money-feathers were
                        beginning to grow again he felt like sprucing about. All this, however, in a
                        much less <pb id="VAA2423-341" n="335"/> imposing way than had been his wont
                        in Chicago. He avoided the gay places where he would be apt to meet those
                        who had known him.</p>
                    <p>Now, Carrie began to feel this in various sensory ways. She was not the kind
                        to be seriously disturbed by his actions. Not loving him greatly, she could
                        not be jealous in a disturbing way. In fact, she was not jealous at all.
                        Hurstwood was pleased with her placid manner, when he should have duly
                        considered it. When he did not come home it did not seem anything like a
                        terrible thing to her. She gave him credit for having the usual allurements
                        of menpeople to talk to. places to stop, friends to consult with. She was
                        perfectly willing that he should enjoy himself in his way, but she did not
                        care to be neglected herself. Her state still seemed fairly reasonable,
                        however. All she did observe was that Hurstwood was somewhat different.</p>
                    <p>Some time in the second year of their residence in Seventy-eighth Street the
                        flat across the hall from Carrie became vacant, and into it moved a very
                        handsome young woman and her husband, with both of whom Carrie afterwards
                        became acquainted. This was brought about solely by the arrangement of the
                        flats, which were united in one place, as it were, by the dumb-waiter. This
                        useful elevator, by which fuel, groceries, and the like were sent up from
                        the basement, and garbage and waste sent down, was used by both residents of
                        one floor; that is, a small door opened into it from each flat.</p>
                    <p>If the occupants of both flats answered to the whistle of the janitor at the
                        same time, they would stand face to face when they opened the dumb-waiter
                        doors. One morning, when Carrie went to remove her paper, the newcomer, a
                        handsome brunette of perhaps twenty-three years of age, was there for a like
                        purpose. She <pb id="VAA2423-342" n="336"/> was in a night-robe and
                        dressing-gown, with her hair very much tousled, but she looked so pretty and
                        good-natured that Carrie instantly conceived a liking for her. The newcomer
                        did no more than smile shamefacedly, but it was sufficient. Carrie felt that
                        she would like to know her, and a similar feeling stirred in the mind of the
                        other, who admired Carrie&apos;s innocent face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s a real pretty woman who has moved in next
                        door,&quot; said Carrie to Hurstwood at the breakfast table.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who are they?&quot; asked Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;The name on
                        the bell is Vance. Some one over there plays beautifully. I guess it must be
                        she.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you never can tell what sort of people you&apos;re living
                        next to in this town, can you?&quot; said Hurstwood, expressing the
                        customary New York opinion about neighbours.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just think,&quot; said Carrie, &quot;I have been in this
                        house with nine other families for over a year and I don&apos;t know a
                        soul. These people have been here over a month and I haven&apos;t seen
                        any one before this morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s just as well,&quot; said Hurstwood. &quot;You
                        never know who you&apos;re going to get in with. Some of these people
                        are pretty bad company.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I expect so,&quot; said Carrie, agreeably.</p>
                    <p>The conversation turned to other things, and Carrie thought no more upon the
                        subject until a day or two later, when, going out to market, she encountered
                        Mrs. Vance coming in. The latter recognised her and nodded, for which Carrie
                        returned a smile. This settled the probability of acquaintanceship. If there
                        had been no faint recognition on this occasion, there would have been no
                        future association.</p>
                    <p>Carrie saw no more of Mrs. Vance for several weeks, but she heard her play
                        through the thin walls which <pb id="VAA2423-343" n="337"/> divided the
                        front rooms of the flats, and was pleased by the merry selection of pieces
                        and the brilliance of their rendition. She could play only moderately
                        herself, and such variety as Mrs. Vance exercised bordered, for Carrie, upon
                        the verge of great art. Everything she had seen and heard thus farthe merest
                        scraps and shadowsindicated that these people were, in a measure, refined
                        and in comfortable circumstances. So Carrie was ready for any extension of
                        the friendship which might follow.</p>
                    <p>One day Carrie&apos;s bell rang and the servant, who was in the kitchen,
                        pressed the button which caused the front door of the general entrance on
                        the ground floor to be electrically unlatched. When Carrie waited at her own
                        door on the third floor to see who it might be coming up to call on her,
                        Mrs. Vance appeared.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope you&apos;ll excuse me,&quot; she said. &quot;I
                        went out a while ago and forgot my outside key, so I thought I&apos;d
                        ring your bell.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was a common trick of other residents of the building, whenever they had
                        forgotten their outside keys. They did not apologise for it, however.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;I&apos;m glad you
                        did. I do the same thing sometimes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t it just delightful weather?&quot; said Mrs.
                        Vance, pausing for a moment.</p>
                    <p>Thus, after a few more preliminaries, this visiting acquaintance was well
                        launched, and in the young Mrs. Vance Carrie found an agreeable
                        companion.</p>
                    <p>On several occasions Carrie visited her and was visited. Both flats were good
                        to look upon, though that of the Vances tended somewhat more to the
                        luxurious.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want you to come over this evening and meet my husband,&quot;
                        said Mrs. Vance, not long after their intimacy <pb id="VAA2423-344" n="338"
                        /> began. &quot;He wants to meet you. You play cards, don&apos;t
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A little,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we&apos;ll have a game of cards. If your husband comes
                        home bring him over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s not coming to dinner to-night,&quot; said
                        Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, when he does come we&apos;ll call him in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie acquiesced, and that evening met the portly Vance, an individual a few
                        years younger than Hurstwood, and who owed his seemingly comfortable
                        matrimonial state much more to his money than to his good looks. He thought
                        well of Carrie upon the first glance and laid himself out to be genial,
                        teaching her a new game of cards and talking to her about New York and its
                        pleasures. Mrs. Vance played some upon the piano, and at last Hurstwood
                        came.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am very glad to meet you,&quot; he said to Mrs. Vance when
                        Carrie introduced him, showing much of the old grace which had captivated
                        Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you think your wife had run away?&quot; said Mr. Vance,
                        extending his hand upon introduction.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t know but what she might have found a better
                        husband,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>He now turned his attention to Mrs. Vance, and in a flash Carrie saw again
                        what she for some time had sub-consciously missed in Hurstwoodthe adroitness
                        and flattery of which he was capable. She also saw that she was not well
                        dressednot nearly as well dressedas Mrs. Vance. These were not vague ideas
                        any longer. Her situation was cleared up for her. She felt that her life was
                        becoming stale, and therein she felt cause for gloom. The old helpful,
                        urging melancholy was restored. The desirous Carrie was whispered to
                        concerning her possibilities.</p>
                    <p>There were no immediate results to this awakening, <pb id="VAA2423-345"
                            n="339"/> for Carrie had little power of initiative; but, nevertheless,
                        she seemed ever capable of getting herself into the tide of change where she
                        would be easily borne along. Hurstwood noticed nothing. He had been
                        unconscious of the marked contrasts which Carrie had observed. He did not
                        even detect the shade of melancholy which settled in her eyes. Worst of all,
                        she now began to feel the loneliness of the flat and seek the company of
                        Mrs. Vance, who liked her exceedingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s go to the matine this afternoon,&quot; said Mrs.
                        Vance, who had stepped across into Carrie&apos;s flat one morning, still
                        arrayed in a soft pink dressing-gown, which she had donned upon rising.
                        Hurstwood and Vance had gone their separate ways nearly an hour before.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Carrie, noticing the air of the petted
                        and well-groomed woman in Mrs. Vance&apos;s general appearance. She
                        looked as though she was dearly loved and her every wish gratified.
                        &quot;What shall we see?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I do want to see Nat Goodwin,&quot; said Mrs. Vance.
                        &quot;I do think he is the jolliest actor. The papers say this is such a
                        good play.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What time will we have to start?&quot; asked Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s go at one and walk down Broadway from Thirty-fourth
                        Street,&quot; said Mrs. Vance. &quot;It&apos;s such an
                        interesting walk. He&apos;s at the Madison Square.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll be glad to go,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;How
                        much will we have to pay for seats?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not more than a dollar,&quot; said Mrs. Vance.</p>
                    <p>The latter departed, and at one o&apos;clock reappeared, stunningly
                        arrayed in a dark-blue walking dress, with a nobby hat to match. Carrie had
                        gotten herself up charmingly enough, but this woman pained her by contrast.
                        She seemed to have so many dainty little things which Carrie had not. There
                        were trinkets of gold, an <pb id="VAA2423-346" n="340"/> elegant green
                        leather purse set with her initials, a fancy handkerchief, exceedingly rich
                        in design, and the like. Carrie felt that she needed more and better clothes
                        to compare with this woman, and that any one looking at the two would pick
                        Mrs. Vance for her raiment alone. It was a trying, though rather unjust
                        thought, for Carrie had now developed an equally pleasing figure, and had
                        grown in comeliness until she was a thoroughly attractive type of her colour
                        of beauty. There was some difference in the clothing of the two, both of
                        quality and age, but this difference was not especially noticeable. It
                        served, however, to augment Carrie&apos;s dissatisfaction with her
                        state.</p>
                    <p>The walk down Broadway, then as now, was one of the remarkable features of
                        the city. There gathered, before the matine and afterwards, not only all the
                        pretty women who love a showy parade, but the men who love to gaze upon and
                        admire them. It was a very imposing procession of pretty faces and fine
                        clothes. Women appeared in their very best hats, shoes, and gloves, and
                        walked arm in arm on their way to the fine shops or theatres strung along
                        from Fourteenth to Thirty-fourth streets. Equally the men paraded with the
                        very latest they could afford. A tailor might have secured hints on suit
                        measurements, a shoemaker on proper lasts and colours, a hatter on hats. It
                        was literally true that if a lover of fine clothes secured a new suit, it
                        was sure to have its first airing on Broadway. So true and well understood
                        was this fact, that several years later a popular song, detailing this and
                        other facts concerning the afternoon parade on matine days, and entitled
                        &quot;What Right Has He on Broadway?&quot; was published, and had
                        quite a vogue about the music-halls of the city.</p>
                    <p>In all her stay in the city, Carrie had never heard of <pb id="VAA2423-347"
                            n="341"/> this showy parade; had never even been on Broadway when it was
                        taking place. On the other hand, it was a familiar thing to Mrs. Vance, who
                        not only knew of it as an entity, but had often been in it, going purposely
                        to see and be seen, to create a stir with her beauty and dispel any tendency
                        to fall short in dressiness by contrasting herself with the beauty and
                        fashion of the town.</p>
                    <p>Carrie stepped along easily enough after they got out of the car at
                        Thirty-fourth Street, but soon fixed her eyes upon the lovely company which
                        swarmed by and with them as they proceeded. She noticed suddenly that Mrs.
                        Vance&apos;s manner had rather stiffened under the gaze of handsome men
                        and elegantly dressed ladies, whose glances were not modified by any rules
                        of propriety. To stare seemed the proper and natural thing. Carrie found
                        herself stared at and ogled. Men in flaw-less top-coats, high hats, and
                        silver-headed walking sticks elbowed near and looked too often into
                        conscious eyes. Ladies rustled by in dresses of stiff cloth, shedding
                        affected smiles and perfume. Carrie noticed among them the sprinkling of
                        goodness and the heavy percentage of vice. The rouged and powdered cheeks
                        and lips, the scented hair, the large, misty, and languorous eye, were
                        common enough. With a start she awoke to find that she was in
                        fashion&apos;s crowd, on parade in a show placeand such a show place!
                        Jewellers&apos; windows gleamed along the path with remarkable
                        frequency. Florist shops, furriers. haberdashers, confectionersall followed
                        in rapid succession. The street was full of coaches. Pompous doormen in
                        immense coats, shiny brass belts and buttons, waited in front of expensive
                        salesrooms. Coachmen in tan boots, white tights, and blue jackets waited
                        obsequiously for the mistresses of carriages who were shopping inside. <pb
                            id="VAA2423-348" n="342"/> The whole street bore the flavour of riches
                        and show, and Carrie felt that she was not of it. She could not, for the
                        life of her, assume the attitude and smartness of Mrs. Vance, who, in her
                        beauty, was all assurance. She could only imagine that it must be evident to
                        many that she was the less handsomely dressed of the two. It cut her to the
                        quick, and she resolved that she would not come here again until she looked
                        better. At the same time she longed to feel the delight of parading here as
                        an equal. Ah, then she would be happy!</p>

                    <p>Such feelings as were generated in Carrie by this walk put her in an
                        exceedingly receptive mood for the pathos which followed in the play. The
                        actor whom they had gone to see had achieved his popularity by presenting a
                        mellow type of comedy, in which sufficient sorrow was introduced to lend
                        contrast and relief to humour. For Carrie, as we well know, the stage had a
                        great attraction. She had never forgotten her one histrionic achievement in
                        Chicago. It dwelt in her mind and occupied her consciousness during many
                        long afternoons in which her rocking-chair and her latest novel contributed
                        the only pleasures of her state. Never could she witness a play without
                        having her own ability vividly brought to consciousness. Some scenes made
                        her long to be a part of themto give expression to the feelings which she,
                        in the place of the character represented, would feel. Almost invariably she
                        would carry the vivid imaginations away with her and brood over them the
                        next day alone. She lived as much in these things as in the realities which
                        made up her daily life.</p>
                    <p>It was not often that she came to the play stirred to her heart&apos;s
                        core by actualities. To-day a low song of longing had been set singing in
                        her heart by the finery, the merriment, the beauty she had seen. Oh, these
                        women who had passed her by, hundreds and hundreds strong, who were they?
                        Whence came the rich, elegant <pb id="VAA2423-350" n="344"/> dresses, the
                        astonishingly coloured buttons, the knick-knacks of silver and gold? Where
                        were these lovely creatures housed? Amid what elegancies of carved
                        furniture, decorated walls, elaborate tapestries did they move? Where were
                        their rich apartments, loaded with all that money could provide? In what
                        stables champed these sleek, nervous horses and rested the gorgeous
                        carriages? Where lounged the richly groomed footmen? Oh, the mansions, the
                        lights, the perfume, the loaded boudoirs and tables! New York must be filled
                        with such bowers, or the beautiful, insolent, supercilious creatures could
                        not be. Some hothouses held them. It ached her to know that she was not one
                        of themthat, alas, she had dreamed a dream and it had not come true. She
                        wondered at her own solitude these two years pasther indifference to the
                        fact that she had never achieved what she had expected.</p>
                    <p>The play was one of those drawing-room concoctions in which charmingly
                        overdressed ladies and gentlemen suffer the pangs of love and jealousy amid
                        gilded surroundings. Such bon-mots are ever enticing to those who have all
                        their days longed for such material surroundings and have never had them
                        gratified. They have the charm of showing suffering under ideal conditions.
                        Who would not grieve upon a gilded chair? Who would not suffer amid perfumed
                        tapestries, cushioned furniture, and liveried servants? Grief under such
                        circumstances becomes an enticing thing. Carrie longed to be of it. She
                        wanted to take her sufferings, whatever they were, in such a world, or
                        failing that, at least to simulate them under such charming conditions upon
                        the stage. So affected was her mind by what she had seen, that the play now
                        seemed an extraordinarily beautiful thing. She was soon lost in the world it
                        represented, and wished that she might <pb id="VAA2423-351" n="345"/> never
                        return. Between the acts she studied the galaxy of matine attendants in
                        front rows and boxes, and conceived a new idea of the possibilities of New
                        York. She was sure she had not seen it allthat the city was one whirl of
                        pleasure and delight.</p>
                    <p>Going out, the same Broadway taught her a sharper lesson. The scene she had
                        witnessed coming down was now augmented and at its height. Such a crush of
                        finery and folly she had never seen. It clinched her convictions concerning
                        her state. She had not lived, could not lay claim to having lived, until
                        something of this had come into her own life. Women were spending money like
                        water; she could see that in every elegant shop she passed. Flowers, candy,
                        jewelry, seemed the principal things in which the elegant dames were
                        interested. And sheshe had scarcely enough pin money to indulge in such
                        outings as this a few times a month.</p>
                    <p>That night the pretty little flat seemed a commonplace thing. It was not what
                        the rest of the world was enjoying. She saw the servant working at dinner
                        with an indifferent eye. In her mind were running scenes of the play.
                        Particularly she remembered one beautiful actressthe sweetheart who had been
                        wooed and won. The grace of this woman had won Carrie&apos;s heart. Her
                        dresses had been all that art could suggest, her sufferings had been so
                        real. The anguish which she had portrayed Carrie could feel. It was done as
                        she was sure she could do it. There were places in which she could even do
                        better. Hence she repeated the lines to herself. Oh, if she could only have
                        such a part, how broad would be her life! She, too, could act
                        appealingly.</p>
                    <p>When Hurstwood came, Carrie was moody. She was sitting, rocking and thinking,
                        and did not care to <pb id="VAA2423-352" n="346"/> have her enticing
                        imaginations broken in upon; so she said little or nothing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter, Carrie?&quot; said Hurstwood after
                        a time, noticing her quiet, almost moody state.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;I don&apos;t feel
                        very well to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not sick, are you?&quot; he asked, approaching very close.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; she said, almost pettishly, &quot;I just
                        don&apos;t feel very good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s too bad,&quot; he said, stepping away and
                        adjusting his vest after his slight bending over. &quot;I was thinking
                        we might go to a show to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to go,&quot; said Carrie, annoyed that
                        her fine visions should have thus been broken into and driven out of her
                        mind. &quot;I&apos;ve been to the matine this
                        afternoon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you have?&quot; said Hurstwood. &quot;What was
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A Gold Mine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How was it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pretty good,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you don&apos;t want to go again to-night?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think I do,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, wakened out of her melancholia and called to the dinner table,
                        she changed her mind. A little food in the stomach does wonders. She went
                        again, and in so doing temporarily recovered her equanimity. The great
                        awakening blow had, however, been delivered. As often as she might recover
                        from these discontented thoughts now, they would occur again. Time and
                        repetitionah, the wonder of it! The dropping water and the solid stonehow
                        utterly it yields at last!</p>
                    <p>Not long after this matine experienceperhaps a <pb id="VAA2423-353" n="347"/>
                        monthMrs. Vance invited Carrie to an evening at the theatre with them. She
                        heard Carrie say that Hurstwood was not coming home to dinner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you come with us? Don&apos;t get dinner for
                        yourself. We&apos;re going down to Sherry&apos;s for dinner and then
                        over to the Lyceum. Come along with us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I will,&quot; answered Carrie.</p>
                    <p>She began to dress at three o&apos;clock for her departure at half-past
                        five for the noted dining-room which was then crowding Delmonico&apos;s
                        for position in society. In this dressing Carrie showed the influence of her
                        association with the dashing Mrs. Vance. She had constantly had her
                        attention called by the latter to novelties in everything which pertains to
                        a woman&apos;s apparel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you going to get such and such a hat?&quot; or,
                        &quot;Have you seen the new gloves with the oval pearl
                        buttons?&quot; were but sample phrases out of a large selection.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The next time you get a pair of shoes, dearie,&quot; said Mrs.
                        Vance, &quot;get button, with thick soles and patent-leather tips.
                        They&apos;re all the rage this fall.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, dear, have you seen the new shirtwaists at Altman&apos;s?
                        They have some of the loveliest patterns. I saw one there that I know would
                        look stunning on you. I said so when I saw it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie listened to these things with considerable interest, for they were
                        suggested with more of friendliness than is usually common between pretty
                        women. Mrs. Vance liked Carrie&apos;s stable good-nature so well that
                        she really took pleasure in suggesting to her the latest things.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you get yourself one of those nice serge skirts
                        they&apos;re selling at Lord &amp; Taylor&apos;s?&quot; she
                        said one day. &quot;They&apos;re the circular style, and
                        they&apos;re going to <pb id="VAA2423-354" n="348"/> be worn from now
                        on. A dark blue one would look so nice on you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie listened with eager ears. These things never came up between her and
                        Hurstwood. Nevertheless, she began to suggest one thing and another, which
                        Hurstwood agreed to without any expression of opinion. He noticed the new
                        tendency on Carrie&apos;s part, and finally, hearing much of Mrs. Vance
                        and her delightful ways, suspected whence the change came. He was not
                        inclined to offer the slightest objection so soon, but he felt that
                        Carrie&apos;s wants were expanding. This did not appeal to him exactly,
                        but he cared for her in his own way, and so the thing stood. Still, there
                        was something in the details of the transactions which caused Carrie to feel
                        that her requests were not a delight to him. He did not enthuse over the
                        purchases. This led her to believe that neglect was creeping in, and so
                        another small wedge was entered.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, one of the results of Mrs. Vance&apos;s suggestions was the
                        fact that on this occasion Carrie was dressed somewhat to her own
                        satisfaction. She had on her best, but there was comfort in the thought that
                        if she must confine herself to a <hi rend="i">best,</hi> it was neat and
                        fitting. She looked the well-groomed woman of twenty-one, and Mrs. Vance
                        praised her, which brought colour to her plump cheeks and a noticeable
                        brightness into her large eyes. It was threatening rain, and Mr. Vance, at
                        his wife&apos;s request, had called a coach.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your husband isn&apos;t coming?&quot; suggested Mr. Vance,
                        as he met Carrie in his little parlour.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No; he said he wouldn&apos;t be home for dinner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better leave a little note for him, telling him where we are. He
                        might turn up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will,&quot; said Carrie, who had not thought of it
                        before.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-355" n="349"/>
                    <p>&quot;Tell him we&apos;ll be at Sherry&apos;s until eight
                        o&apos;clock. He knows, though, I guess.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie crossed the hall with rustling skirts, and scrawled the note, gloves
                        on. When she returned a newcomer was in the Vance flat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mrs. Wheeler, let use introduce Mr. Ames, a cousin of
                        mine,&quot; said Mrs. Vance. &quot;He&apos;s going along with
                        us, aren&apos;t you, Bob?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m very glad to meet you,&quot; said Ames, bowing
                        politely to Carrie.</p>
                    <p>The latter caught in a glance the dimensions of a very stalwart figure. She
                        also noticed that he was smooth-shaven, good looking, and young, but nothing
                        more.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Ames is just down in New York for a few days,&quot; put in
                        Vance, &quot;and we&apos;re trying to show him around a
                        little.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, are you?&quot; said Carrie, taking another glance at the
                        newcomer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; I am just on here from Indianapolis fora week or so,&quot;
                        said young Ames, seating himself on the edge of a chair to wait while Mrs.
                        Vance completed the last touches of her toilet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess you find New York quite a thing to see, don&apos;t
                        you?&quot; said Carrie, venturing something to avoid a possible deadly
                        silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is rather large to get around in a week,&quot; answered
                        Ames, pleasantly.</p>
                    <p>He was an exceedingly genial soul, this young man, and wholly free of
                        affectation. It seemed to Carrie he was as yet only overcoming the last
                        traces of the bash-fulness of youth. He did not seem apt at conversation,
                        but he had the merit of being well dressed and wholly courageous. Carrie
                        felt as if it were not going to be hard to talk to him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-356" n="350"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I guess we&apos;re ready now. The coach is
                        outside.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on, people,&quot; said Mrs. Vance, coming in smiling.
                        &quot;Bob, you&apos;ll have to look after Mrs.
                        Wheeler.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll try to,&quot; said Bob smiling, and edging closer
                        to Carrie. &quot;You won&apos;t need much watching, will
                        you?&quot; he volunteered, in a sort of ingratiating and help-me-out
                        kind of way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not very, I hope,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>They descended the stairs, Mrs. Vance offering suggestions, and climbed into
                        the open coach.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Vance, slamming the coach door, and the
                        conveyance rolled away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it we&apos;re going to see?&quot; asked Ames.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sothern,&quot; said Vance, &quot;in &apos;Lord
                        Chumley.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he is so good!&quot; said Mrs. Vance.
                        &quot;He&apos;s just the funniest man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I notice the papers praise it,&quot; said Ames.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t any doubt,&quot; put in Vance, &quot;but
                        we&apos;ll all enjoy it very much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ames had taken a seat beside Carrie, and accordingly he felt it his bounden
                        duty to pay her some attention. He was interested to find her so young a
                        wife, and so pretty, though it was only a respectful interest. There was
                        nothing of the dashing lady&apos;s man about him. He had respect for the
                        married state, and thought only of some pretty marriageable girls in
                        Indianapolis.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you a born New Yorker?&quot; asked Ames of Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no; I&apos;ve only been here for two years.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, well, you&apos;ve had time to see a great deal of it,
                        anyhow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t seem to have,&quot; answered Carrie.
                        &quot;It&apos;s about as strange to me as when I first came
                        here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re not from the West, are you?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-357" n="351"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. I&apos;m from Wisconsin,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it does seem as if most people in this town haven&apos;t
                        been here so very long. I hear of lots of Indiana people in my line who are
                        here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is your line?&quot; asked Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m connected with an electrical company,&quot; said
                        the youth.</p>
                    <p>Carrie followed up this desultory conversation with occasional interruptions
                        from the Vances. Several times it became general and partially humorous, and
                        in that manner the restaurant was reached.</p>
                    <p>Carrie had noticed the appearance of gayety and pleasure-seeking in the
                        streets which they were following. Coaches were numerous, pedestrians many,
                        and in Fifty-ninth Street the street cars were crowded. At Fifty-ninth
                        Street and Fifth Avenue a blaze of lights from several new hotels which
                        bordered the Plaza Square gave a suggestion of sumptuous hotel life. Fifth
                        Avenue, the home of the wealthy, was noticeably crowded with carriages, and
                        gentlemen in evening dress. At Sherry&apos;s an imposing doorman opened
                        the coach door and helped them out. Young Ames held Carrie&apos;s elbow
                        as he helped her up the steps. They entered the lobby already swarming with
                        patrons, and then, after divesting themselves of their wraps, went into a
                        sumptuous dining-room.</p>
                    <p>In all Carrie&apos;s experience she had never seen anything like this. In
                        the whole time she had been in New York Hurstwood&apos;s modified state
                        had not permitted his bringing her to such a place. There was an almost
                            <unclear>-ndescribable</unclear> atmosphere about it which convinced the
                        newcomer that this was the proper thing. Here was the place where the matter
                        of expense limited the patrons to the moneyed or pleasure-loving class.
                        Carrie had read of it often in the &quot;Morning&quot; and
                        &quot;Evening <pb id="VAA2423-358" n="352"/> World.&quot; She had
                        seen notices of dances, parties, balls, and suppers at Sherry&apos;s.
                        The Misses So-and-so would give a party on Wednesday evening at
                        Sherry&apos;s. Young Mr. So-and-so would entertain a party of friends at
                        a private luncheon on the sixteenth, at Sherry&apos;s. The common run of
                        conventional, perfunctory notices of the doings of society, which she could
                        scarcely refrain from scanning each day, had given her a distinct idea of
                        the gorgeousness and luxury of this wonderful temple of gastronomy. Now, at
                        last, she was really in it. She had come up the imposing steps, guarded by
                        the large and portly doorman. She had seen the lobby, guarded by another
                        large and portly gentleman, and been waited upon by uniformed youths who
                        took care of canes, overcoats, and the like. Here was the splendid
                        dining-chamber, all decorated and aglow, where the wealthy ate. Ah, how
                        fortunate was Mrs. Vance; young, beautiful, and well offat least,
                        sufficiently so to come here in a coach. What a wonderful thing it was to be
                        rich.</p>
                    <p>Vance led the way through lanes of shining tables, at which were seated
                        parties of two, three, four, five, or six. The air of assurance and dignity
                        about it all was exceedingly noticeable to the novitiate. Incandescent
                        lights, the reflection of their glow in polished glasses, and the shine of
                        gilt upon the walls, combined into one tone of light which it requires
                        minutes of complacent observation to separate and take particular note of.
                        The white shirt fronts of the gentlemen, the bright costumes of the ladies,
                        diamonds, jewels, fine feathersall were exceedingly noticeable.</p>
                    <p>Carrie walked with an air equal to that of Mrs. Vance, and accepted the seat
                        which the head waiter provided for her. She was keenly aware of all the
                        little things that were donethe little genuflections and attentions <pb
                            id="VAA2423-359" n="353"/> of the waiters and head waiter which
                        Americans pay for. The air with which the latter pulled out each chair, and
                        the wave of the hand with which he motioned them to be seated, were worth
                        several dollars in themselves.</p>
                    <p>Once seated, there began that exhibition of showy, wasteful, and unwholesome
                        gastronomy as practised by wealthy Americans, which is the wonder and
                        astonishment of true culture and dignity the world over. The large bill of
                        fare held an array of dishes sufficient to feed an army, sidelined with
                        prices which made reasonable expenditure a ridiculous impossibilityan order
                        of soup at fifty cents or a dollar, with a dozen kinds to choose from;
                        oysters in forty styles and at sixty cents the half-dozen; entres, fish, and
                        meats at prices which would house one over night in an average hotel. One
                        dollar fifty and two dollars seemed to be the most common figures upon this
                        most tastefully printed bill of fare.</p>
                    <p>Carrie noticed this, and in scanning it the price of spring chicken carried
                        her back to that other bill of fare and far different occasion when, for the
                        first time, she sat with Drouet in a good restaurant in Chicago. It was only
                        momentarya sad note as out of an old songand then it was gone. But in that
                        flash was seen the other Carriepoor, hungry, drifting at her wits&apos;
                        ends, and all Chicago a cold and closed world, from which she only wandered
                        because she could not find work.</p>
                    <p>On the walls were designs in colour, square spots of robin&apos;s-egg
                        blue, set in ornate frames of gilt, whose corners were elaborate mouldings
                        of fruit and flowers, with fat cupids hovering in angelic comfort. On the
                        ceilings were coloured traceries with more gilt, leading to a centre where
                        spread a cluster of lightsin-candescent <pb id="VAA2423-360" n="354"/>
                        globes mingled with glittering prisms and stucco tendrils of gilt. The floor
                        was of a reddish hue, waxed and polished, and in every direction were
                        mirrorstall, brilliant, bevel-edged mirrorsreflecting and re-reflecting
                        forms, faces, and candelabra a score and a hundred times.</p>
                    <p>The tables were not so remarkable in themselves, and yet the imprint of
                        Sherry upon the napery, the name of Tiffany upon the silverware, the name of
                        Haviland upon the china, and over all the glow of the small, red-shaded
                        candelabra and the reflected tints of the walls on garments and faces, made
                        them seem remarkable. Each waiter added an air of exclusiveness and elegance
                        by the manner in which he bowed, scraped, touched, and trifled with things.
                        The exclusively personal attention which he devoted to each one, standing
                        half bent, ear to one side, elbows akimbo, saying: &quot;Soupgreen
                        turtle, yes. One portion, yes. Oysterscertainlyhalf-dozenyes. Asparagus.
                        Olivesyes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It would be the same with each one, only Vance essayed to order for all,
                        inviting counsel and suggestions. Carrie studied the company with open eyes.
                        So this was high life in New York. It was so that the rich spent their days
                        and evenings. Her poor little mind could not rise above applying each scene
                        to all society. Every fine lady must be in the crowd on Broadway in the
                        afternoon, in the theatre at the matine, in the coaches and dining-halls at
                        night. It must be glow and shine everywhere, with coaches waiting, and
                        footmen attending, and she was out of it all. In two long years she had
                        never even been in such a place as this.</p>
                    <p>Vance was in his element here, as Hurstwood would have been in former days.
                        He ordered freely of soup, oysters, roast meats, and side dishes, and had
                        several <pb id="VAA2423-361" n="355"/> bottles of wine brought, which were
                        set down beside the table in a wicker basket.</p>
                    <p>Ames was looking away rather abstractedly at the crowd and showed an
                        interesting profile to Carrie. His forehead was high, his nose rather large
                        and strong, his chin moderately pleasing. He had a good, wide, well-shaped
                        mouth, and his dark-brown hair was parted slightly on one side. He seemed to
                        have the least touch of boyishness to Carrie, and yet he was a man full
                        grown.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you know,&quot; he said, turning back to Carrie, after his
                        reflection, &quot;I sometimes think it is a shame for people to spend so
                        much money this way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at him a moment with the faintest touch of surprise at his
                        seriousness. He seemed to be thinking about something over which she had
                        never pondered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you?&quot; she answered, interestedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;they pay so much more than these
                        things are worth. They put on so much show.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know why people shouldn&apos;t spend when they
                        have it,&quot; said Mrs. Vance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It doesn&apos;t do any harm,&quot; said Vance, who was
                        still studying the bill of fare, though he had ordered.</p>
                    <p>Ames was looking away again, and Carrie was again looking at his forehead. To
                        her he seemed to be thinking about strange things. As he studied the crowd
                        his eye was mild.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look at that woman&apos;s dress over there,&quot; he said,
                        again turning to Carrie, and nodding in a direction.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where?&quot; said Carrie, following his eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Over there in the cornerway over. Do you see that
                        brooch?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-362" n="356"/>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t it large?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One of the largest clusters of jewels I have ever seen,&quot;
                        said Ames.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is, isn&apos;t it?&quot; said Carrie. She felt as if she
                        would like to be agreeable to this young man, and also there came with it,
                        or perhaps preceded it, the slightest shade of a feeling that he was better
                        educated than she wasthat his mind was better. He seemed to look it, and the
                        saving grace in Carrie was that she could understand that people could be
                        wiser. She had seen a number of people in her life who reminded her of what
                        she had vaguely come to think of as scholars. This strong young man beside
                        her, with his clear, natural look, seemed to get a hold of things which she
                        did not quite understand, but approved of. It was fine to be so, as a man,
                        she thought.</p>
                    <p>The conversation changed to a book that was having its vogue at the time
                        &quot;Moulding a Maiden,&quot; by Albert Ross. Mrs. Vance had read
                        it. Vance had seen it discussed in some of the papers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A man can make quite a strike writing a book,&quot; said Vance.
                        &quot;I notice this fellow Ross is very much talked about.&quot; He
                        was looking at Carrie as he spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hadn&apos;t heard of him,&quot; said Carrie,
                        honestly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I have,&quot; said Mrs. Vance. &quot;He&apos;s
                        written lots of things. This last story is pretty good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He doesn&apos;t amount to much,&quot; said Ames.</p>
                    <p>Carrie turned her eyes toward him as to an oracle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;His stuff is nearly as bad as &apos;Dora Thorne,&apos;
                        &quot; concluded Ames.</p>
                    <p>Carrie felt this as a personal reproof. She read &quot;Dora
                        Thorne,&quot; or had a great deal in the past. It seemed only fair to
                        her, but she supposed that people thought it very fine. Now this clear-eyed,
                        fine-headed youth, who looked something like a student to her, made fun of
                        it. <pb id="VAA2423-363" n="357"/> It was poor to him, not worth reading.
                        She looked down, and for the first time felt the pain of not
                        understanding.</p>
                    <p>Yet there was nothing sarcastic or supercilious in the way Ames spoke. He had
                        very little of that in him. Carrie felt that it was just kindly thought of a
                        high orderthe right thing to think, and wondered what else was right,
                        according to him. He seemed to notice that she listened and rather
                        sympathised with him, and from now on he talked mostly to her.</p>
                    <p>As the waiter bowed and scraped about, felt the dishes to see if they were
                        hot enough, brought spoons and forks, and did all those little attentive
                        things calculated to impress the luxury of the situation upon the diner,
                        Ames also leaned slightly to one side and told her of Indianapolis in an
                        intelligent way. He really had a very bright mind, which was finding its
                        chief development in electrical knowledge. His sympathies for other forms of
                        information, however, and for types of people, were quick and warm. The red
                        glow on his head gave it a sandy tinge and put a bright glint in his eye.
                        Carrie noticed all these things as he leaned toward her and felt exceedingly
                        young. This man was far ahead of her. He seemed wiser than Hurstwood, saner
                        and brighter than Drouet. He seemed innocent and clean, and she thought that
                        he was exceedingly pleasant. She noticed, also, that his interest in her was
                        a far-off one. She was not in his life, nor any of the things that touched
                        his life, and yet now, as he spoke of these things, they appealed to
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shouldn&apos;t care to be rich,&quot; he told her, as the
                        dinner proceeded and the supply of food warmed up his sympathies;
                        &quot;not rich enough to spend my money this way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, wouldn&apos;t you?&quot; said Carrie, the, to her, new
                            <pb id="VAA2423-364" n="358"/> attitude forcing itself distinctly upon
                        her for the first time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;What good would it do? A man
                        doesn&apos;t need this sort of thing to be happy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie thought of this doubtfully; but, coming from him, it had weight with
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He probably could be happy,&quot; she thought to herself,
                        &quot;all alone. He&apos;s so strong.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Vance kept up a running fire of interruptions, and these
                        impressive things by Ames came at odd moments. They were sufficient,
                        however, for the atmosphere that went with this youth impressed itself upon
                        Carrie without words. There was something in him, or the world he moved in,
                        which appealed to her. He reminded her of scenes she had seen on the
                        stagethe sorrows and sacrifices that always went with she knew not what. He
                        had taken away some of the bitterness of the contrast between this life and
                        her life, and all by a certain calm indifference which concerned only
                        him.</p>
                    <p>As they went out, he took her arm and helped her into the coach, and then
                        they were off again, and so to the show.</p>
                    <p>During the acts Carrie found herself listening to him very attentively. He
                        mentioned things in the play which she most approved ofthings which swayed
                        her deeply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you think it rather fine to be an actor?&quot;
                        she asked once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; he said,&quot; to be a good one. I think
                        the theatre a great thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Just this little approval set Carrie&apos;s heart bounding. Ah, if she
                        could only be an actressa good one! This man was wisehe knewand he approved
                        of it. If she were a fine actress, such men as he would approve <pb
                            id="VAA2423-365" n="359"/> of her. She felt that he was good to speak as
                        he had, although it did not concern her at all. She did not know why she
                        felt this way.</p>
                    <p>At the close of the show it suddenly developed that he was not going back
                        with them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, aren&apos;t you?&quot; said Carrie, with an
                        unwarrantable feeling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; he said; &quot;I&apos;m stopping right
                        around here in Thirty-third Street.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie could not say anything else, but somehow this development shocked her.
                        She had been regretting the wane of a pleasant evening, but she had thought
                        there was a half-hour more. Oh, the half-hours, the minutes of the world;
                        what miseries and griefs are crowded into them!</p>
                    <p>She said good-bye with feigned indifference. What matter could it make?
                        Still, the coach seemed lorn.</p>
                    <p>When she went into her own flat she had this to think about. She did not know
                        whether she would ever see this man any more. What difference could it
                        makewhat difference could it make?</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood had returned, and was already in bed. His clothes were scattered
                        loosely about. Carrie came to the door and saw him, then retreated. She did
                        not want to go in yet a while. She wanted to think. It was disagreeable to
                        her.</p>
                    <p>Back in the dining-room she sat in her chair and rocked. Her little hands
                        were folded tightly as she thought. Through a fog of longing and conflicting
                        desires she was beginning to see. Oh, ye legions of hope and pityof sorrow
                        and pain! She was rocking, and beginning to see.</p>

                    <p>The immediate result of this was nothing. Results from such things are
                        usually long in growing. Morning brings a change of feeling. The existent
                        condition invariably pleads for itself. It is only at odd moments that we
                        get glimpses of the misery of things. The heart understands when it is
                        confronted with contrasts. Take them away and the ache subsides.</p>
                    <p>Carrie went on, leading much this same life for six months thereafter or
                        more. She did not see Ames any more. He called once upon the Vances, but she
                        only heard about it through the young wife. Then he went West, and there was
                        a gradual subsidence of whatever personal attraction had existed. The mental
                        effect of the thing had not gone, however, and never would entirely. She had
                        an ideal to contrast men byparticularly men close to her.</p>
                    <p>During all this timea period rapidly approaching three yearsHurstwood had
                        been moving along in an even path. There was no apparent slope downward, and
                        distinctly none upward, so far as the casual observer might have seen. But
                        psychologically there was a change, which was marked enough to suggest the
                        future very distinctly indeed. This was in the mere matter of the halt his
                        career had received when he departed from Chicago. A man&apos;s fortune
                        or material progress is very much the same as his bodily growth. Either he
                        is growing stronger, healthier, wiser, as the <pb id="VAA2423-367" n="361"/>
                        youth approaching manhood, or he is growing weaker, older, less incisive
                        mentally, as the man approaching old age. There are no other states.
                        Frequently there is a period between the cessation of youthful accretion and
                        the setting in, in the case of the middle-aged man, of the tendency toward
                        decay when the two processes are almost perfectly balanced and there is
                        little doing in either direction. Given time enough, however, the balance
                        becomes a sagging to the grave side. Slowly at first, then with a modest
                        momentum, and at last the graveward process is in the full swing. So it is
                        frequently with man&apos;s fortune. If its process of accretion is never
                        halted, if the balancing stage is never reached, there will be no toppling.
                        Rich men are, frequently, in these days, saved from this dissolution of
                        their fortune by their ability to hire younger brains. These younger brains
                        look upon the interests of the fortune as their own, and so steady and
                        direct its progress. If each individual were left absolutely to the care of
                        his own interests, and were given time enough in which to grow exceedingly
                        old, his fortune would pass as his strength and will. He and his would be
                        utterly dissolved and scattered unto the four winds of the heavens.</p>
                    <p>But now see wherein the parallel changes. A fortune, like a man, is an
                        organism which draws to itself other minds and other strength than that
                        inherent in the founder. Beside the young minds drawn to it by salaries, it
                        becomes allied with young forces, which make for its existence even when the
                        strength and wisdom of the founder are fading. It may be conserved by the
                        growth of a community or of a state. It may be involved in providing
                        something for which there is a growing demand. This removes it at once
                        beyond the special care of the founder. It needs not so much foresight <pb
                            id="VAA2423-368" n="362"/> now as direction. The man wanes, the need
                        continues or grows, and the fortune, fallen into whose hands it may,
                        continues. Hence, some men never recognise the turning in the tide of their
                        abilities. It is only in chance cases, where a fortune or a state of success
                        is wrested from them, that the lack of ability to do as they did formerly
                        becomes apparent. Hurstwood, set down under new conditions, was in a
                        position to see that he was no longer young. If he did not, it was due
                        wholly to the fact that his state was so well balanced that an absolute
                        change for the worse did not show.</p>
                    <p>Not trained to reason or introspect himself, he could not analyse the change
                        that was taking place in his mind, and hence his body, but he felt the
                        depression of it. Constant comparison between his old state and his new
                        showed a balance for the worse, which produced a constant state of gloom or,
                        at least, depression. Now, it has been shown experimentally that a
                        constantly subdued frame of mind produces certain poisons in the blood,
                        called katastates, just as virtuous feelings of pleasure and delight produce
                        helpful chemicals called anastates. The poisons generated by remorse inveigh
                        against the system, and eventually produce marked physical deterioration. To
                        these Hurstwood was subject.</p>
                    <p>In the course of time it told upon his temper. His eye no longer possessed
                        that buoyant, searching shrewdness which had characterised it in Adams
                        Street. His step was not as sharp and firm. He was given to thinking,
                        thinking, thinking. The new friends he made were not celebrities. They were
                        of a cheaper, a slightly more sensual and cruder, grade. He could not
                        possibly take the pleasure in this company that he had in that of those fine
                        frequenters of the Chicago resort. He was left to brood.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-369" n="363"/>
                    <p>Slowly, exceedingly slowly, his desire to greet, conciliate, and make at home
                        these people who visited the Warren Street place passed from him. More and
                        more slowly the significance of the realm he had left began to be clear. It
                        did not seem so wonderful to be in it when he was in it. It had seemed very
                        easy for any one to get up there and have ample raiment and money to spend,
                        but now that he was out of it, how far off it became. He began to see as one
                        sees a city with a wall about it. Men were posted at the gates. You could
                        not get in. Those inside did not care to come out to see who you were. They
                        were so merry inside there that all those outside were forgotten, and he was
                        on the outside.</p>
                    <p>Each day he could read in the evening papers of the doings within this walled
                        city. In the notices of passengers for Europe he read the names of eminent
                        frequenters of his old resort. In the theatrical column appeared, from time
                        to time, announcements of the latest successes of men he had known. He knew
                        that they were at their old gayeties. Pullmans were hauling them to and fro
                        about the land, papers were greeting them with interesting mentions, the
                        elegant lobbies of hotels and the glow of polished dining-rooms were keeping
                        them close within the walled city. Men whom he had known, men whom he had
                        tipped glasses withrich men, and he was forgotten! Who was Mr. Wheeler? What
                        was the Warren Street resort? Bah!</p>
                    <p>If one thinks that such thoughts do not come to so common a type of mindthat
                        such feelings require a higher mental developmentI would urge for their
                        consideration the fact that it is the higher mental development that does
                        away with such thoughts. It is the higher mental development which induces
                        philosophy and that fortitude which refuses to dwell upon such <pb
                            id="VAA2423-370" n="364"/> thingsrefuses to be made to suffer by their
                        consideration. The common type of mind is exceedingly keen on all matters
                        which relate to its physical welfareexceedingly keen. It is the
                        unintellectual miser who sweats blood at the loss of a hundred dollars. It
                        is the Epictetus who smiles when the last vestige of physical welfare is
                        removed.</p>
                    <p>The time came, in the third year, when this thinking began to produce results
                        in the Warren Street place. The tide of patronage dropped a little below
                        what it had been at its best since he had been there. This irritated and
                        worried him.</p>
                    <p>There came a night when he confessed to Carrie that the business was not
                        doing as well this month as it had the month before. This was in lieu of
                        certain suggestions she had made concerning little things she wanted to buy.
                        She had not failed to notice that he did not seem to consult her about
                        buying clothes for himself. For the first time, it struck her as a ruse, or
                        that he said it so that she would not think of asking for things. Her reply
                        was mild enough, but her thoughts were rebellious. He was not looking after
                        her at all. She was depending for her enjoyment upon the Vances.</p>
                    <p>And now the latter announced that they were going away. It was approaching
                        spring, and they were going North.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Mrs. Vance to Carrie, &quot;we think we
                        might as well give up the flat and store our things. We&apos;ll be gone
                        for the summer, and it would be a useless expense. I think we&apos;ll
                        settle a little farther down town when we come back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie heard this with genuine sorrow. She had enjoyed Mrs. Vance&apos;s
                        companionship so much. There was no one else in the house whom she knew.
                        Again she would be all alone.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-371" n="365"/>
                    <p>Hurstwood&apos;s gloom over the slight decrease in profits and the
                        departure of the Vances came together. So Carrie had loneliness and this
                        mood of her husband to enjoy at the same time. It was a grievous thing. She
                        became restless and dissatisfied, not exactly, as she thought, with
                        Hurstwood, but with life. What was it? A very dull round indeed. What did
                        she have? Nothing but this narrow, little flat. The Vances could travel,
                        they could do the things worth doing, and here she was. For what was she
                        made, anyhow? More thought followed, and then tearstears seemed justified,
                        and the only relief in the world.</p>
                    <p>For another period this state continued, the twain leading a rather
                        monotonous life, and then there was a slight change for the worse. One
                        evening, Hurstwood, after thinking about a way to modify Carrie&apos;s
                        desire for clothes and the general strain upon his ability to provide,
                        said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever be able to do much with
                        Shaughnessy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he&apos;s a slow, greedy &apos;mick&apos;! He
                        won&apos;t agree to anything to improve the place, and it won&apos;t
                        ever pay without it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t you make him?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No; I&apos;ve tried. The only thing I can see, if I want to
                        improve, is to get hold of a place of my own.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, all I have is tied up in there just now. If I had a chance to
                        save a while I think I could open a place that would give us plenty of
                        money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t we save?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We might try it,&quot; he suggested. &quot;I&apos;ve
                        been thinking that if we&apos;d take a smaller flat down town and live
                        economically for a year, I would have enough, with <pb id="VAA2423-372"
                            n="366"/> what I have invested, to open a good place. Then we could
                        arrange to live as you want to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It would suit me all right,&quot; said Carrie, who,
                        nevertheless, felt badly to think it had come to this. Talk of a smaller
                        flat sounded like poverty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There are lots of nice little flats down around Sixth Avenue, below
                        Fourteenth Street. We might get one down there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll look at them if you say so,&quot; said
                        Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I could break away from this fellow inside of a
                        year,&quot; said Hurstwood. &quot;Nothing will ever come of this
                        arrangement as it&apos;s going on now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll look around,&quot; said Carrie, observing that
                        the proposed change seemed to be a serious thing with him.</p>
                    <p>The upshot of this was that the change was eventually effected; not without
                        great gloom on the part of Carrie. It really affected her more seriously
                        than anything that had yet happened. She began to look upon Hurstwood wholly
                        as a man, and not as a lover or husband. She felt thoroughly bound to him as
                        a wife, and that her lot was cast with his, whatever it might be; but she
                        began to see that he was gloomy and taciturn, not a young, strong, and
                        buoyant man. He looked a little bit old to her about the eyes and mouth now,
                        and there were other things which placed him in his true rank, so far as her
                        estimation was concerned. She began to feel that she had made a mistake.
                        Incidentally, she also began to recall the fact that he had practically
                        forced her to flee with him.</p>
                    <p>The new flat was located in Thirteenth Street, a half block west of Sixth
                        Avenue, and contained only four rooms. The new neighbourhood did not appeal
                        to Carrie as much. There were no trees here, no west view of the river. The
                        street was solidly built up. There were twelve families here, respectable
                        enough, <pb id="VAA2423-373" n="367"/> but nothing like the Vances. Richer
                        people required more space.</p>
                    <p>Being left alone in this little place, Carrie did without a girl. She made it
                        charming enough, but could not make it delight her. Hurstwood was not
                        inwardly pleased to think that they should have to modify their state, but
                        he argued that he could do nothing. He must put the best face on it, and let
                        it go at that.</p>
                    <p>He tried to show Carrie that there was no cause for financial alarm, but only
                        congratulation over the chance he would have at the end of the year by
                        taking her rather more frequently to the theatre and by providing a liberal
                        table. This was for the time only. He was getting in the frame of mind where
                        he wanted principally to be alone and to be allowed to think. The disease of
                        brooding was beginning to claim him as a victim. Only the newspapers and his
                        own thoughts were worth while. The delight of love had again slipped away.
                        It was a case of live, now, making the best you can out of a very
                        commonplace station in life.</p>
                    <p>The road downward has but few landings and level places. The very state of
                        his mind, superinduced by his condition, caused the breach to widen between
                        him and his partner. At last that individual began to wish that Hurstwood
                        was out of it. It so happened, however, that a real estate deal on the part
                        of the owner of the land arranged things even more effectually than ill-will
                        could have schemed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you see that?&quot; said Shaughnessy one morning to
                        Hurstwood, pointing to the real estate column in a copy of the
                        &quot;Herald,&quot; which he held.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, what is it?&quot; said Hurstwood, looking down the items of
                        news.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The man who owns this ground has sold it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t say so?&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-374" n="368"/>
                    <p>He looked, and there was the notice. Mr. August Viele had yesterday
                        registered the transfer of the lot, 25 X 75 feet, at the corner of Warren
                        and Hudson streets, to J. F. Slawson for the sum of $57,000.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Our lease expires when? &quot;asked Hurstwood, thinking.
                        &quot;Next February, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; said Shaughnessy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It doesn&apos;t say what the new man&apos;s going to do
                        with it,&quot; remarked Hurstwood, looking back to the paper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll hear, I guess, soon enough,&quot; said
                        Shaughnessy.</p>
                    <p>Sure enough, it did develop. Mr. Slawson owned the property adjoining, and
                        was going to put up a modern office building. The present one was to be torn
                        down. It would take probably a year and a half to complete the other
                        one.</p>
                    <p>All these things developed by degrees, and Hurstwood began to ponder over
                        what would become of the saloon. One day he spoke about it to his
                        partner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think it would be worth while to open up somewhere else in
                        the neighbourhood?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What would be the use?&quot; said Shaughnessy. &quot;We
                        couldn&apos;t get another corner around here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It wouldn&apos;t pay anywhere else, do you think?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t try it,&quot; said the other.</p>
                    <p>The approaching change now took on a most serious aspect to Hurstwood.
                        Dissolution meant the loss of his thousand dollars, and he could not save
                        another thousand in the time. He understood that Shaughnessy was merely
                        tired of the arrangement, and would probably lease the new corner, when
                        completed, alone. He began to worry about the necessity of a new connection
                        and to see impending serious financial straits unless something turned up.
                        This left him in no mood <pb id="VAA2423-375" n="369"/> to enjoy his flat or
                        Carrie, and consequently the depression invaded that quarter.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, he took such time as he could to look about, but opportunities
                        were not numerous. More, he had not the same impressive personality which he
                        had when he first came to New York. Bad thoughts had put a shade into his
                        eyes which did not impress others favourably. Neither had he thirteen
                        hundred dollars in hand to talk with. About a month later, finding that he
                        had not made any progress, Shaughnessy reported definitely that Slawson
                        would not extend the lease.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess this thing&apos;s got to come to an end,&quot; he
                        said, affecting an air of concern.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, if it has, it has,&quot; answered Hurstwood, grimly. He
                        would not give the other a key to his opinions, whatever they were. He
                        should not have the satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>A day or two later he saw that he must say some-thing to Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know,&quot; he said, &quot;I think I&apos;m going
                        to get the worst of my deal down there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How is that?&quot; asked Carrie in astonishment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, the man who owns the ground has sold it, and the new owner
                        won&apos;t re-lease it to us. The business may come to an
                        end.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t you start somewhere else?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There doesn&apos;t seem to be any place. Shaughnessy
                        doesn&apos;t want to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you lose what you put in?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hurstwood, whose face was a study.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, isn&apos;t that too bad?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a trick,&quot; said Hurstwood.
                        &quot;That&apos;s all. They&apos;ll start another place there
                        all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at him, and gathered from his whole <pb id="VAA2423-376"
                            n="370"/> demeanour what it meant. It was serious, very serious.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think you can get something else?&quot; she ventured,
                        timidly.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood thought a while. It was all up with the bluff about money and
                        investment. She could see now that he was &quot;broke.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he said solemnly; &quot;I can
                        try.&quot;</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE GRIND OF THE MILLSTONES: A SAMPLE OF CHAFF</head>
                    <p>Carrie pondered over this situation as consistently as Hurstwood, once she
                        got the facts adjusted in her mind. It took several days for her to fully
                        realise that the approach of the dissolution of her husband&apos;s
                        business meant commonplace struggle and privation. Her mind went back to her
                        early venture in Chicago, the Hansons and their flat, and her heart
                        revolted. That was terrible! Everything about poverty was terrible. She
                        wished she knew a way out. Her recent experiences with the Vances had wholly
                        unfitted her to view her own state with complacence. The glamour of the high
                        life of the city had, in the few experiences afforded her by the former,
                        seized her completely. She had been taught how to dress and where to go
                        without having ample means to do either. Now, these thingsever-present
                        realities as they werefilled her eyes and mind. The more circumscribed
                        became her state, the more entrancing seemed this other. And now poverty
                        threatened to seize her entirely and to remove this other world far upward
                        like a heaven to which any Lazarus might extend, appealingly, his hands.</p>
                    <p>So, too, the ideal brought into her life by Ames remained. He had gone, but
                        here was his word that riches were not everything; that there was a great
                        deal more in the world than she knew; that the stage was good, and the
                        literature she read poor. He was a <pb id="VAA2423-378" n="372"/> strong man
                        and cleanhow much stronger and better than Hurstwood and Drouet she only
                        half formulated to herself, but the difference was painful. It was something
                        to which she voluntarily closed her eyes.</p>
                    <p>During the last three months of the Warren Street connection, Hurstwood took
                        parts of days off and hunted, tracking the business advertisements. It was a
                        more or less depressing business, wholly because of the thought that he must
                        soon get something or he would begin to live on the few hundred dollars he
                        was saving, and then he would have nothing to investhe would have to hire
                        out as a clerk.</p>
                    <p>Everything he discovered in his line advertised as an opportunity, was either
                        too expensive or too wretched for him. Besides, winter was coming, the
                        papers were announcing hardships, and there was a general feeling of hard
                        times in the air, or, at least, he thought so. In his worry, other
                        people&apos;s worries became apparent. No item about a firm failing, a
                        family starving, or a man dying upon the streets, supposedly of starvation,
                        but arrested his eye as he scanned the morning papers. Once the
                        &quot;World&quot; came out with a flaring announcement about
                        &quot;80,000 people out of employment in New York this winter,&quot;
                        which struck as a knife at his heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Eighty thousand!&quot; he thought. &quot;What an awful
                        thing that is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was new reasoning for Hurstwood. In the old days the world had seemed to
                        be getting along well enough. He had been wont to see similar things in the
                        &quot;Daily News,&quot; in Chicago, but they did not hold his
                        attention. Now, these things were like grey clouds hovering along the
                        horizon of a clear day. They threatened to cover and obscure his life with
                        chilly greyness. He tried to shake them off, to forget and brace up.
                        Sometimes he said to himself, mentally:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-379" n="373"/>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the use worrying? I&apos;m not out yet.
                        I&apos;ve got six weeks more. Even if worst comes to worst,
                        I&apos;ve got enough to live on for six months.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Curiously, as he troubled over his future, his thoughts occasionally reverted
                        to his wife and family. He had avoided such thoughts for the first three
                        years as much as possible. He hated her, and he could get along without her.
                        Let her go. He would do well enough. Now, however, when he was not doing
                        well enough, he began to wonder what she was doing, how his children were
                        getting along. He could see them living as nicely as ever, occupying the
                        comfortable house and using his property.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By George! its a shame they should have it all,&quot; he
                        vaguely thought to himself on several occasions. &quot;I didn&apos;t
                        do anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As he looked back now and analysed the situation which led up to his taking
                        the money, he began mildly to justify himself. What had he donewhat in the
                        worldthat should bar him out this way and heap such difficulties upon him?
                        It seemed only yesterday to him since he was comfortable and well-to-do. But
                        now it was all wrested from him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She didn&apos;t deserve what she got out of me, that is sure. I
                        didn&apos;t do so much, if everybody could just know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was no thought that the facts ought to be advertised. It was only a
                        mental justification he was seeking from himselfsomething that would enable
                        him to bear his state as a righteous man.</p>
                    <p>One afternoon, five weeks before the Warren Street place closed up, he left
                        the saloon to visit three or four places he saw advertised in the
                        &quot;Herald.&quot; One was down in Gold Street, and he visited
                        that, but did not enter. It was such a cheap looking place he felt that <pb
                            id="VAA2423-380" n="374"/> he could not abide it. Another was on the
                        Bowery, which he knew contained many showy resorts. It was near Grand
                        Street, and turned out to be very handsomely fitted up. He talked around
                        about investments for fully three-quarters of an hour with the proprietor,
                        who maintained that his health was poor, and that was the reason he wished a
                        partner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, now, just how much money would it take to buy a half interest
                        here?&quot; said Hurstwood, who saw seven hundred dollars as his
                        limit.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Three thousand,&quot; said the man.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood&apos;s jaw fell.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cash?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cash.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He tried to put on an air of deliberation, as one who might really buy; but
                        his eyes showed gloom. He wound tip by saying he would think it over, and
                        cane away. The man he had been talking to sensed his condition in a vague
                        way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think he wants to buy,&quot; he said to
                        himself. &quot;He doesn&apos;t talk right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The afternoon was as grey as lead and cold. It was blowing up a disagreeable
                        winter wind. He visited a place far up on the east side, near Sixty-ninth
                        Street, and it was five o&apos;clock, and growing dim, when he reached
                        there. A portly German kept this place.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How about this ad. of yours?&quot; asked Hurstwood, who rather
                        objected to the looks of the place.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, dat iss all over,&quot; said the German. &quot;I vill
                        not sell now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, is that so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; dere is nothing to dat. It iss all over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Hurstwood, turning around.</p>
                    <p>The German paid no more attention to him, and it made him angry.</p>

                    <p>&quot;The crazy ass!&quot; he said to himself. &quot;What does he
                        want to advertise for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wholly depressed, he started for Thirteenth Street. The flat had only a light
                        in the kitchen, where Carrie was working. He struck a match and, lighting
                        the gas, sat down in the dining-room without even greeting her. She came to
                        the door and looked in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s you, is it?&quot; she said, and went back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, without even looking up from the evening
                        paper he had bought.</p>
                    <p>Carrie saw things were wrong with him. He was not so handsome when gloomy.
                        The lines at the sides of the eyes were deepened. Naturally dark of skin,
                        gloom made him look slightly sinister. He was quite a disagreeable
                        figure.</p>
                    <p>Carrie set the table and brought in the meal.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dinner&apos;s ready,&quot; she said, passing him for
                        something.</p>
                    <p>He did not answer, reading on.</p>
                    <p>She came in and sat down at her place, feeling exceedingly wretched.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you eat now?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>He folded his paper and drew near, silence holding for a time, except for the
                        &quot;Pass me&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s been gloomy to-day, hasn&apos;t it?&quot;
                        ventured Carrie, after a time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>He only picked at his food.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you still sure to close up?&quot; said Carrie, venturing to
                        take up the subject which they had discussed often enough.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course we are,&quot; he said, with the slightest
                        modification of sharpness.</p>
                    <p>This retort angered Carrie. She had had a dreary day of it herself.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-382" n="376"/>
                    <p>&quot;You needn&apos;t talk like that,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; he exclaimed, pushing back from the table, as if to
                        say more, but letting it go at that. Then he picked up his paper. Carrie
                        left her seat, containing herself with difficulty. He saw she was hurt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t go &apos;way,&quot; he said, as she started
                        back into the kitchen. &quot;Eat your dinner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She passed, not answering.</p>
                    <p>He looked at the paper a few moments, and then rose up and put on his
                        coat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going down town, Carrie,&quot; he said, coming
                        out. &quot;I&apos;m out of sorts to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t be angry,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be
                        all right tomorrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her, but she paid no attention to him, working at her
                        dishes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-bye!&quot; he said finally, and went out.</p>
                    <p>This was the first strong result of the situation between them, but with the
                        nearing of the last day of the business the gloom became almost a permanent
                        thing. Hurstwood could not conceal his feelings about the matter. Carrie
                        could not help wondering where she was drifting. It got so that they talked
                        even less than usual, and yet it was not Hurstwood who felt any objection to
                        Carrie. It was Carrie who shied away from him. This he noticed. It aroused
                        an objection to her becoming indifferent to him. He made the possibility of
                        friendly intercourse almost a giant task, and then noticed with discontent
                        that Carrie added to it by her manner and made it more impossible.</p>
                    <p>At last the final day came. When it actually arrived, Hurstwood, who had got
                        his mind into such a state where a thunder-clap and raging storm would have
                        seemed highly appropriate, was rather relieved to <pb id="VAA2423-383"
                            n="377"/> find that it was a plain, ordinary day. The sun shone, the
                        temperature was pleasant. He felt, as he came to the breakfast table, that
                        it wasn&apos;t so terrible, after all.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said to Carrie, &quot;to-day&apos;s my
                        last day on earth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie smiled in answer to his humour.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood glanced over his paper rather gayly. He seemed to have lost a
                        load.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll go down for a little while,&quot; he said after
                        breakfast, &quot;and then I&apos;ll look around. To-morrow
                        I&apos;ll spend the whole day looking about. I think I can get
                        some-thing, now this thing&apos;s off my hands.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went out smiling and visited the place. Shaughnessy was there. They had
                        made all arrangements to share according to their interests. When, however,
                        he had been there several hours, gone out three more, and returned, his
                        elation had departed. As much as he had objected to the place, now that it
                        was no longer to exist, he felt sorry. He wished that things were
                        different.</p>
                    <p>Shaughnessy was coolly business-like.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said at five o&apos;clock, &quot;we
                        might as well count the change and divide.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They did so. The fixtures had already been sold and the sum divided.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-night,&quot; said Hurstwood at the final moment, in a last
                        effort to be genial.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So long,&quot; said Shaughnessy; scarcely deigning a
                        notice.</p>
                    <p>Thus the Warren Street arrangement was permanently concluded.</p>
                    <p>Carrie had prepared a good dinner at the flat, but after his ride up,
                        Hurstwood was in a solemn and reflective mood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well?&quot; said Carrie, inquisitively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m out of that,&quot; heanswered, taking off his
                        coat.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-384" n="378"/>
                    <p>As she looked at him, she wondered what his financial state was now. They ate
                        and talked a little.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you have enough to buy in anywhere else?&quot;asked
                        Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ll have to get
                        something else and save up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It would be nice if you could get some place,&quot; said
                        Carrie, prompted by anxiety and hope.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess I will,&quot; he said reflectively.</p>
                    <p>For some days thereafter he put on his overcoat regularly in the morning and
                        sallied forth. On these ventures he first consoled himself with the thought
                        that with the seven hundred dollars he had he could still make some
                        advantageous arrangement. He thought about going to some brewery, which, as
                        he knew, frequently controlled saloons which they leased, and get them to
                        help him. Then he remembered that he would have to pay out several hundred
                        any way for fixtures and that he would have nothing left for his monthly
                        expenses. It was costing him nearly eighty dollars a month to live.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, in his sanest moments, &quot;I
                        can&apos;t do it I&apos;ll get something else and save
                        up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This getting-something proposition complicated itself the moment he began to
                        think of what it was he wanted to do. Manage a place? Where should he get
                        such a position? The papers contained no requests for managers. Such
                        positions, he knew well enough, were either secured by long years of service
                        or were bought with a half or third interest. Into a place important enough
                        to need such a manager he had not money enough to buy.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, he started out. His clothes were very good and his appearance
                        still excellent, but it involved the trouble of deluding. People, looking at
                        him, imagined <pb id="VAA2423-385" n="379"/> instantly that a man of his
                        age, stout and well dressed, must be well off. He appeared a comfortable
                        owner of something, a man from whom the common run of mortals could well
                        expect gratuities. Being now forty-three years of age, and comfortably
                        built, walking was not easy. He had not been used to exercise for many
                        years. His legs tired, his shoulders ached, and his feet pained him at the
                        close of the day, even when he took street cars in almost every direction.
                        The mere getting up and down, if long continued, produced this result.</p>
                    <p>The fact that people took him to be better off than he was, he well
                        understood. It was so painfully clear to him that it retarded his search.
                        Not that he wished to be less well-appearing, but that he was ashamed to
                        belie his appearance by incongruous appeals. So he hesitated, wondering what
                        to do.</p>
                    <p>He thought of the hotels, but instantly he remembered that he had had no
                        experience as a clerk, and, what was more important, no acquaintances or
                        friends in that line to whom he could go. He did know some hotel owners in
                        several cities, including New York, but they knew of his dealings with
                        Fitzgerald and Moy. He could not apply to them. He thought of other lines
                        suggested by large buildings or businesses which he knew ofwhole-sale
                        groceries, hardware, insurance concerns, and the likebut he had had no
                        experience.</p>
                    <p>How to go about getting anything was a bitter thought. Would he have to go
                        personally and ask; wait outside an office door, and, then, distinguished
                        and affluent looking, announce that he was looking for something to do? He
                        strained painfully at the thought. No, he could not do that.</p>
                    <p>He really strolled about, thinking, and then, the weather being cold, stepped
                        into a hotel. He knew hotels <pb id="VAA2423-386" n="380"/> well enough to
                        know that any decent looking individual was welcome to a chair in the lobby.
                        This was in the Broadway Central, which was then one of the most important
                        hotels in the city. Taking a chair here was a painful thing to him. To think
                        he should come to this! He had heard loungers about hotels called
                        chair-warmers. He had called them that himself in his day. But here he was,
                        despite the possibility of meeting some one who knew him, shielding himself
                        from cold and the weariness of the streets in a hotel lobby.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t do this way,&quot; he said to himself.
                        &quot;There&apos;s no use of my starting out mornings without first
                        thinking up some place to go. I&apos;ll think of some places and then
                        look them up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It occurred to him that the positions of bartenders were sometimes open, but
                        he put this out of his mind. Bartenderhe, the ex-manager!</p>
                    <p>It grew awfully dull sitting in the hotel lobby, and so at four he went home.
                        He tried to put on a business air as he went in, but it was a feeble
                        imitation. The rocking-chair in the dining-room was comfortable. He sank
                        into it gladly, with several papers he had bought, and began to read.</p>
                    <p>As she was going through the rosin to begin preparing dinner, Carrie
                        said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;The man was here for the rent to-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, was he? &quot;said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>The least wrinkle crept into his brow as he remembered that this was February
                        2d, the time the man always called. He fished down in his pocket for his
                        purse, getting the first taste of paying out when nothing is coming in. He
                        looked at the fat, green roll as a sick man looks at the one possible saving
                        cure. Then he counted off twenty-eight dollars.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-387" n="381"/>
                    <p>&quot;Here you are,&quot; he said to Carrie, when she came through
                        again.</p>
                    <p>He buried himself in his papers and read. Oh, the rest of itthe relief from
                        walking and thinking! What Lethean waters were these floods of telegraphed
                        intelligence! He forgot his troubles, in part. Here was a young, handsome
                        woman, if you might believe the newspaper drawing, suing a rich, fat,
                        candy-making husband in Brooklyn for divorce. Here was another item
                        detailing the wrecking of a vessel in ice and snow off Prince&apos;s Bay
                        on Staten Island. A long, bright column told of the doings in the theatrical
                        worldthe plays produced, the actors appearing, the managers making
                        announcements. Fannie Davenport was just opening at the Fifth Avenue. Daly
                        was producing &quot;King Lear.&quot; He read of the early departure
                        for the season of a party composed of the Vanderbilts and their friends for
                        Florida. An interesting shooting affray was on in the mountains of Kentucky.
                        So he read, read, read, rocking in the warm room near the radiator and
                        waiting for dinner to be served.</p>

                    <p>The next morning he looked over the papers and waded through a long list of
                        advertisements, making a few notes. Then he turned to the male-help-wanted
                        column, but with disagreeable feelings. The day was before hima long day in
                        which to discover somethingand this was how he most begin to discover. He
                        scanned the long column, which mostly concerned bakers, bushelmen, cooks,
                        compositors, drivers, and the like, finding two things only which arrested
                        his eye. One was a cashier wanted in a wholesale furniture house, and the
                        other a salesman for a whiskey house. He had never thought of the latter. At
                        once he decided to look that up.</p>
                    <p>The firm in question was Alsbery &amp; Co., whiskey brokers.</p>
                    <p>He was admitted almost at once to the manager on his appearance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-morning, sir,&quot; said the latter, thinking at first
                        that he was encountering one of his out-of-town customers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-morning,&quot; said Hurstwood. &quot;You advertised, I
                        believe, for a salesman?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said the man, showing plainly the enlightenment which
                        had come to him. &quot;Yes. Yes, I did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I&apos;d drop in,&quot; said Hurstwood, with
                        dignity. &quot;I&apos;ve had some experience in that line
                        myself.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-389" n="383"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, have you?&quot; said the man. &quot;What experience
                        have you had?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ve managed several liquor houses in my time.
                        Recently I owned a third-interest in a saloon at Warren and Hudson
                        streets.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see,&quot; said the man.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood ceased, waiting for some suggestion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We did want a salesman,&quot; said the man. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t know as it&apos;s anything you&apos;d care to take
                        hold of, though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see,&quot; said Hurstwood. &quot;Well, I&apos;m in no
                        position to choose, just at present. If it were open, I should be glad to
                        get it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The man did not take kindly at all to his &quot;No position to
                        choose.&quot; He wanted some one who wasn&apos;t thinking of a
                        choice or something better. Especially not an old man. He wanted some one
                        young, active, and glad to work actively for a moderate sum. Hurstwood did
                        not please him at all. He had more of an air than his employers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said in answer, &quot;we&apos;d be glad
                        to consider your application. We shan&apos;t decide for a few days yet.
                        Suppose you send us your references.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>He nodded good-morning and came away. At the corner he looked at the
                        furniture company&apos;s address, and saw that it was in West
                        Twenty-third Street. Accordingly, he went up there. The place was not large
                        enough, however. It looked moderate, the men in it idle and small salaried.
                        He walked by, glancing in, and then decided not to go in there.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They want a girl, probably, at ten a week,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>At one o&apos;clock he thought of eating, and went to a restaurant in
                        Madison Square. There he pondered over places which he might look up. He was
                        tired. It <pb id="VAA2423-390" n="384"/> was blowing tip grey again. Across
                        the way, through Madison Square Park, stood the great hotels, looking down
                        upon a busy scene. He decided to go over to the lobby of one and sit a
                        while. It was warm in there and bright. He had seen no one he knew at the
                        Broadway Central. In all likelihood he would encounter no one here. Finding
                        a seat on one of the red plush divans close to the great windows which look
                        out on Broadway&apos;s busy rout, he sat musing. His state did not seem
                        so bad in here. Sitting still and looking out, he could take some slight
                        consolation in the few hundred dollars he had in his purse. He could forget,
                        in a measure, the weariness of the street and his tiresome searches. Still,
                        it was only escape from a severe to a less severe state. He was still gloomy
                        and disheartened. There, minutes seemed to go very slowly. An hour was a
                        long, long time in passing. It was filled for him with observations and
                        mental comments concerning the actual guests of the hotel, who passed in and
                        out, and those more prosperous pedestrians whose good fortune showed in
                        their clothes and spirits as they passed along Broadway, outside. It was
                        nearly the first time since he had arrived in the city that his leisure
                        afforded him ample opportunity to contemplate this spectacle. Now, being,
                        perforce, idle himself, he wondered at the activity of others. How gay were
                        the youths he saw, how pretty the women. Such fine clothes they all wore.
                        They were so intent upon getting somewhere. He saw coquettish glances cast
                        by magnificent girls. Ah, the money it required to train with suchhow well
                        he knew! How long it had been since he had had the opportunity to do so!</p>
                    <p>The clock outside registered four. It was a little early, but he thought he
                        would go back to the flat.</p>
                    <p>This going back to the flat was coupled with the <pb id="VAA2423-391" n="385"
                        /> thought that Carrie would think he was sitting around too much if he came
                        home early. He hoped he wouldn&apos;t have to, but the day hung heavily
                        on his hands. Over there he was on his own ground. He could sit in his
                        rocking-chair and read. This busy, distracting, suggestive scene was shut
                        out. He could read his papers. Accordingly, he went home. Carrie was
                        reading, quite alone. It was rather dark in the flat, shut in as it was.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll hurt your eyes,&quot; he said when he saw
                        her.</p>
                    <p>After taking off his coat, he felt it incumbent upon him to make some little
                        report of his day.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve been talking with a wholesale liquor
                        company,&quot; he said. &quot;I may go out on the
                        road.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wouldn&apos;t that be nice!&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It wouldn&apos;t be such a bad thing,&quot; he
                        answered.</p>
                    <p>Always from the man at the corner now he bought two papersthe
                        &quot;Evening World &quot;and &quot;Evening Sun.&quot; So
                        now he merely picked his papers up, as he came by, without stopping.</p>
                    <p>He drew up his chair near the radiator and lighted the gas. Then it was as
                        the evening before. His difficulties vanished in the items he so well loved
                        to read.</p>
                    <p>The next day was even worse than the one before, because now he could not
                        think of where to go. Nothing he saw in the papers he studiedtill ten
                        o&apos;clockappealed to him. He felt that he ought to go out, and yet he
                        sickened at the thought. Where to, where to?</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t forget to leave me my money for this
                        week,&quot; said Carrie, quietly.</p>
                    <p>They had an arrangement by which he placed twelve dollars a week in her
                        hands, out of which to pay current expenses. He heaved a little sigh as she
                        said this, and drew out his purse. Again he felt the dread of the thing.
                        Here he was taking off, taking off, and nothing coming in.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-392" n="386"/>
                    <p>Lord!&quot; he said, in his own thoughts, &quot;this can&apos;t
                        go on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>To Carrie he said nothing whatsoever. She could feel that her request
                        disturbed him. To pay her would soon become a distressing thing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yet, what have I got to do with it?&quot; she thought.
                        &quot;Oh, why should I be made to worry?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood went out and made for Broadway. He wanted to think up some place.
                        Before long, though, he reached the Grand Hotel at Thirty-first Street. He
                        knew of its comfortable lobby. He was cold after his twenty blocks&apos;
                        walk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll go in their barber shop and get a shave,&quot; he
                        thought.</p>
                    <p>Thus he justified himself in sitting down in here after his tonsorial
                        treatment.</p>
                    <p>Again, time hanging heavily on his hands, he went home early, and this
                        continued for several days, each day the need to hunt paining him, and each
                        day disgust, depression, shamefacedness driving him into lobby idleness.</p>
                    <p>At last three days came in which a storm prevailed, and he did not go out at
                        all. The snow began to fall late one afternoon. It was a regular flurry of
                        large, soft, white Rakes. In the morning it was still coming down with a
                        high wind, and the papers announced a blizzard. From out the front windows
                        one could see a deep, soft bedding.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess I&apos;ll not try to go out to-day,&quot; he said
                        to Carrie at breakfast. &quot;It&apos;s going to be awful bad, so
                        the papers say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The man hasn&apos;t brought my coal, either,&quot; said
                        Carrie, who ordered by the bushel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll go over and see about it,&quot; said Hurstwood.
                        This was the first time he had ever suggested doing an <pb id="VAA2423-393"
                            n="387"/> errand, but, somehow, the wish to sit about the house prompted
                        it as a sort of compensation for the privilege.</p>
                    <p>All day and all night it snowed, and the city began to suffer from a general
                        blockade of traffic. Great attention was given to the details of the storm
                        by the newspapers, which played up the distress of the poor in large
                        type.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood sat and read by his radiator in the corner. He did not try to think
                        about his need of work. This storm being so terrific, and tying up all
                        things, robbed him of the need. He made himself wholly comfortable and
                        toasted his feet.</p>
                    <p>Carrie observed his ease with some misgiving. For all the fury of the storm
                        she doubted his comfort. He took his situation too philosophically.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood, however, read on and on. He did not pay much attention to Carrie.
                        She fulfilled her house-hold duties and said little to disturb him.</p>
                    <p>The next day it was still snowing, and the next, bitter cold. Hurstwood took
                        the alarm of the paper and sat still. Now he volunteered to do a few other
                        little things. One was to go to the butcher, another to the grocery. He
                        really thought nothing of these little services in connection with their
                        true significance. He felt as if he were not wholly uselessindeed, in such a
                        stress of weather, quite worth while about the house.</p>
                    <p>On the fourth day, however, it cleared, and he read that the storm was over.
                        Now, however, he idled, thinking how sloppy the streets would be.</p>
                    <p>It was noon before he finally abandoned his papers and got under way. Owing
                        to the slightly warmer temperature the streets were had. He went across
                        Fourteenth Street on the car and got a transfer south on Broadway. One
                        little advertisement he had, relating <pb id="VAA2423-394" n="388"/> to a
                        saloon down in Pearl Street. When he reached the Broadway Central, however,
                        he changed his mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the use?&quot; he thought, looking out upon the
                        slop and snow. &quot;I couldn&apos;t buy into it. It&apos;s a
                        thousand to one nothing comes of it. I guess I&apos;ll get
                        off,&quot; and off he got. In the lobby he took a seat and waited again,
                        wondering what he could do.</p>
                    <p>While he was idly pondering, satisfied to be inside, a well-dressed man
                        passed up the lobby, stopped, looked sharply, as if not sure of his memory,
                        and then approached. Hurstwood recognised Cargill, the owner of the large
                        stables in Chicago of the same name, whom he had last seen at Avery Hall,
                        the night Carrie appeared there. The remembrance of how this individual
                        brought up his wife to shake hands on that occasion was also on the instant
                        clear.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was greatly abashed. His eyes expressed the difficulty he felt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, it&apos;s Hurstwood!&quot; said Cargill, remembering
                        now, and sorry that he had not recognised him quickly enough in the
                        beginning to have avoided this meeting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hurstwood. &quot;How are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Cargill, troubled for something to talk
                        about. &quot;Stopping here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Hurstwood, &quot;just keeping an
                        appointment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I knew you had left Chicago. I was wondering what had become of
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;m here now,&quot; answered Hurstwood, anxious to
                        get away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Doing well, I suppose?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Excellent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Glad to hear it.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-395" n="389"/>
                    <p>They looked at one another, rather embarrassed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I have an engagement with a friend upstairs. I&apos;ll
                        leave you. So long.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood nodded his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Damn it all,&quot; he murmured, turning toward the door.
                        &quot;I knew that would happen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He walked several blocks up the street. His watch only registered 1.30. He
                        tried to think of some place to go or something to do. The day was so bad he
                        wanted only to be inside. Finally his feet began to feel wet and cold, and
                        he boarded a car. This took him to Fifty-ninth Street, which was as good as
                        anywhere else. Landed here, he turned to walk back along Seventh Avenue, but
                        the slush was too much. The misery of lounging about with nowhere to go
                        became intolerable. He felt as if he were catching cold.</p>
                    <p>Stopping at a corner, he waited for a car south bound. This was no day to be
                        out; he would go home.</p>
                    <p>Carrie was surprised to see him at a quarter of three.
                        &quot;It&apos;s a miserable day out,&quot; was all he said. Then
                        he took off his coat and changed his shoes.</p>
                    <p>That night he felt a cold coming on and took quinine. He was feverish until
                        morning, and sat about the next day while Carrie waited on him. He was a
                        helpless creature in sickness, not very handsome in a dull-coloured bath
                        gown and his hair uncombed. He looked haggard about the eyes and quite old.
                        Carrie noticed this, and it did not appeal to her. She wanted to be
                        good-natured and sympathetic, but something about the man held her
                        aloof.</p>
                    <p>Toward evening he looked so badly in the weak light that she suggested he go
                        to bed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d better sleep alone,&quot; she said,
                        &quot;you&apos;ll feel better. I&apos;ll open your bed for you
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-396" n="390"/>
                    <p>As she did all these things, she was in a most despondent state.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a life! What a life!&quot; was her one thought.</p>
                    <p>Once during the day, when he sat near the radiator, hunched up and reading,
                        she passed through, and seeing him, wrinkle- her brows. In the front room,
                        where it was not so warm, she sat by the window and cried. This was the life
                        cut out for her, was it? To live cooped up in a small flat with some one who
                        was out of work, idle, and indifferent to her. She was merely a servant to
                        him now, nothing more.</p>
                    <p>This crying made her eyes red, and when, in preparing his bed, she lighted
                        the gas, and, having prepared it, called him in, he noticed the fact.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter with you?&quot; he asked, looking
                        into her face. His voice was hoarse and his unkempt head only added to its
                        grewsome quality.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Carrie, weakly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve been crying,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t, either,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>It was not for love of him, that he knew.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You needn&apos;t cry,&quot; he said, getting into bed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Things will come out all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In a day or two he was up again, but rough weather holding, he stayed in. The
                        Italian newsdealer now delivered the morning papers, and these he read
                        assiduously. A few times after that he ventured out, but meeting another of
                        his old-time friends, he began to feel uneasy sitting about hotel
                        corridors.</p>
                    <p>Every day he came home early, and at last made no pretence of going anywhere.
                        Winter was no time to look for anything.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, being about the house, he noticed the way Carrie did things. She
                        was far from perfect in household methods and economy, and her little
                        deviations on <pb id="VAA2423-397" n="391"/> this score first caught his
                        eye. Not, however, before her regular demand for her allowance became a
                        grievous thing. Sitting around as he did, the weeks seemed to pass very
                        quickly. Every Tuesday Carrie asked for her money.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think we live as cheaply as we might?&quot; he asked one
                        Tuesday morning.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do the best I can,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>Nothing was added to this at the moment, but the next day he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you ever go to the Gansevoort Market Over here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t know there was such a market,&quot; said
                        Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They say you can get things lots cheaper there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie was very indifferent to the suggestion. These were things which she
                        did not like at all.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much do you pay for a pound of meat?&quot; he asked one
                        day.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, there are different prices,&quot; said Carrie.
                        &quot;Sirloin steak is twenty-two cents.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s steep, isn&apos;t it?&quot; he
                        answered.</p>
                    <p>So he asked about other things, until finally, with the passing days, it
                        seemed to become a maina with him.</p>
                    <p>He learned the prices and remembered them.</p>
                    <p>His errand-running capacity also improved. It began in a small way, of
                        course. Carrie, going to get her hat one morning, was stopped by him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are you going, Carrie?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Over to the baker&apos;s,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d just as leave go for you,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>She acquiesced, and he went. Each afternoon he would go to the corner for the
                        papers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is there anything you want?&quot; he would say.</p>
                    <p>By degrees she began to use him. Doing this, however, she lost the weekly
                        payment of twelve dollars.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-398" n="392"/>
                    <p>&quot;You want to pay me to-day,&quot; she said one Tuesday, about
                        this time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>She understood well enough what it meant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, about five dollars,&quot; she answered. &quot;I owe
                        the coal man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The same day he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think this Italian up here on the corner sells coal at
                        twenty-five cents a bushel. I&apos;ll trade with him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie heard this with indifference.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>Then it came to be:</p>
                    <p>&quot;George, I must have some coal to-day,&quot; or, &quot;You
                        must get some meat of some kind for dinner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He would find out what she needed and order.</p>
                    <p>Accompanying this plan came skimpiness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I only got a half-pound of steak,&quot; he said, coming in one
                        afternoon with his papers. &quot;We never seem to eat very
                        much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>These miserable details ate the heart out of Carrie. They blackened her days
                        and grieved her soul. Oh, how this man had changed! All day and all day,
                        here he sat, reading his papers. The world seemed to have no attraction.
                        Once in a while he would go out, in fine weather, it might be four or five
                        hours, between eleven and four. She could do nothing but view him with
                        gnawing contempt.</p>
                    <p>It was apathy with Hurstwood, resulting from his inability to see his way
                        out. Each month drew from his small store. Now, he had only five hundred
                        dollars left, and this he hugged, half feeling as if he could stave off
                        absolute necessity for an indefinite period. Sitting around the house, he
                        decided to wear some old clothes he had. This came first with the bad days.
                        Only once he apologised in the very beginning:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-399" n="393"/>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s so bad to-day, I&apos;ll just wear these
                        around.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Eventually these became the permanent thing.</p>
                    <p>Also, he had been wont to pay fifteen cents for a shave, and a tip of ten
                        cents. In his first distress, he cut down the tip to five, then to nothing.
                        Later, he tried a ten-cent barber shop, and, finding that the shave was
                        satisfactory, patronized regularly. Later still, he put off shaving to every
                        other day, then to every third, and so on, until once a week became the
                        rule. On Saturday he was a sight to see.</p>
                    <p>Of course, as his own self-respect vanished, it perished for him in Carrie.
                        She could not understand what had gotten into the man. He had some money, he
                        had a decent suit remaining, he was not bad looking when dressed up. She did
                        not forget her own difficult struggle in Chicago, but she did not forget
                        either that she had never ceased trying. He never tried. He did not even
                        consult the ads. in the papers any more.</p>
                    <p>Finally, a distinct impression escaped from her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What makes you put so much butter on the steak?&quot; he asked
                        her one evening, standing around in the kitchen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To make it good, of course,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Butter is awful dear these days,&quot; he suggested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You wouldn&apos;t mind it if you were working,&quot; she
                        answered.</p>
                    <p>He shut up after this, and went in to his paper, but the retort rankled in
                        his mind. It was the first cutting remark that had come from her.</p>
                    <p>That same evening, Carrie, after reading, went off to the front room to bed.
                        This was unusual. When Hurstwood decided to go, he retired, as usual,
                        without a light. It was then that he discovered Carrie&apos;s
                        absence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s funny,&quot; he said; &quot;maybe
                        she&apos;s sitting up.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-400" n="394"/>
                    <p>He gave the matter no more thought, but slept. In the morning she was not
                        beside him. Strange to say, this passed without comment.</p>
                    <p>Night approaching, and a slightly more conversational feeling prevailing,
                        Carrie said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I&apos;ll sleep alone to-night. I have a
                        headache.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>The third night she went to her front bed without apologies.</p>
                    <p>This was a grim blow to Hurstwood, but he never mentioned it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; he said to himself, with an irrepressible
                        frown, &quot;let her sleep alone.&quot;</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">A GRIM RETROGRESSION: THE PHANTOM OF CHANCE</head>
                    <p>The Vances, who had been back in the city ever since Christmas, had not
                        forgotten Carrie; but they, or rather Mrs. Vance, had never called on her,
                        for the very simple reason that Carrie had never sent her address. True to
                        her nature, she corresponded with Mrs. Vance as long as she still lived in
                        Seventy-eighth Street, but when she was compelled to move into Thirteenth,
                        her fear that the latter would take it as an indication of reduced
                        circumstances caused her to study some way of avoiding the necessity of
                        giving her address. Not finding any convenient method, she sorrowfully
                        resigned the privilege of writing to her friend entirely. The latter
                        wondered at this strange silence, thought Carrie must have left the city,
                        and in the end gave her up as lost. So she was thoroughly surprised to
                        encounter her in Fourteenth Street, where she had gone shopping. Carrie was
                        there for the same purpose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Mrs. Wheeler,&quot; said Mrs. Vance, looking Carrie over
                        in a glance, &quot;where have you been? Why haven&apos;t you been to
                        see me? I&apos;ve been wondering all this time what had become of you.
                        Really, I&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m so glad to see you,&quot; said Carrie, pleased and
                        yet nonplussed. Of all times, this was the worst to encounter Mrs. Vance.
                        &quot;Why, I&apos;m living down town here. I&apos;ve been
                        intending to come and see you. Where are you living now?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-402" n="396"/>
                    <p>&quot;In Fifty-eighth Street,&quot; said Mrs. Vance, &quot;just
                        off Seventh Avenue218. Why don&apos;t you come and see me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;Really, I&apos;ve been
                        wanting to come. I know I ought to. It&apos;s a shame. But you
                        know&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s your number?&quot; said Mrs. Vance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thirteenth Street,&quot; said Carrie, reluctantly.
                        &quot;112 West.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Mrs. Vance, &quot;that&apos;s right near
                        here, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;You must come down and see me
                        some time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you&apos;re a fine one,&quot; said Mrs. Vance,
                        laughing, the while noting that Carrie&apos;s appearance had modified
                        somewhat. &quot;The address, too,&quot; she added to herself.
                        &quot;They must be hard up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Still she liked Carrie well enough to take her in tow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come with me in here a minute,&quot; she exclaimed, turning
                        into a store.</p>
                    <p>When Carrie returned home, there was Hurstwood, reading as usual. He seemed
                        to take his condition with the utmost nonchalance. His beard was at least
                        four days old.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; thought Carrie, &quot;if she were to come here
                        and see him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head in absolute misery. It looked as if her situation was
                        becoming unbearable.</p>
                    <p>Driven to desperation, she asked at dinner:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you ever hear any more from that wholesale house?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;They don&apos;t want an
                        inexperienced man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie dropped the subject, feeling unable to say more.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-403" n="397"/>
                    <p>&quot;I met Mrs. Vane this afternoon,&quot; she said, after a
                        time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did, eh?&quot; he answered.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re back in New York now,&quot; Carrie went on.
                        &quot;She did look so nice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, she can afford it as long as he puts up for it,&quot;
                        returned Hurstwood. &quot;He&apos;s got a soft job.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was looking into the paper. He could not see the look of infinite
                        weariness and discontent Carrie gave him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She said she thought she&apos;d call here some
                        day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s been long getting round to it, hasn&apos;t
                        she?&quot; said Hurstwood, with a kind of sarcasm.</p>
                    <p>The woman didn&apos;t appeal to him from her spending side.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I dont&apos;t know,&quot; said Carrie, angered by the
                        man&apos;s attitude. Perhaps I didn&apos;t want her to
                        come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s too gay,&quot; said Hurstwood, significantly,
                        &quot;No one can keep up with her pace unless they&apos;ve got a lot
                        of money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Vance doesn&apos;t seem to find it very hard.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He may not now,&quot; answered Hurstwood, doggedly, well
                        understanding the inference; &quot;but his life isn&apos;t done yet.
                        You can&apos;t tell what&apos;ll happen. He may get down like
                        anybody else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was something quite knavish in the man&apos;s attitude. His eye
                        seemed to be cocked with a twinkle upon the fortunate, expecting their
                        defeat. His own state seemed a thing apartnot considered.</p>
                    <p>This thing was the remains of his old-time cocksureness and independence.
                        Sitting in his flat, and reading of the doings of other people, sometimes
                        this independent, undefeated mood came upon him. Forgetting the weariness of
                        the streets and the degradation of <pb id="VAA2423-404" n="398"/> search, he
                        would sometimes prick up his ears. It was as if he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can do something. I&apos;m not down yet. There&apos;s a
                        lot of things coming to me if I want to go after them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was in this mood that he would occasionally dress up, go for a shave, and,
                        putting on his gloves, sally forth quite actively. Not with any definite
                        aim. It was more a barometric condition. He felt just right for being
                        outside and doing something.</p>
                    <p>On such occasions, his money went also. He knew of several poker rooms down
                        town. A few acquaintances he had in down-town resorts and about the City
                        Hall. It was a change to see them and exchange a few friendly
                        commonplaces.</p>
                    <p>He had once been accustomed to hold a pretty fair hand at poker. Many a
                        friendly game had netted him a hundred dollars or more at the time when that
                        sum was merely sauce to the dish of the gamenot the all in all. Now, he
                        thought of playing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I might win a couple of hundred. I&apos;m not out of
                        practice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It is but fair to say that this thought had occurred to him several times
                        before he acted upon it.</p>
                    <p>The poker room which he first invaded was over a saloon in West Street, near
                        one of the ferries. He had been there before. Several games were going.
                        These he watched for a time and noticed that the pots were quite large for
                        the ante involved.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Deal me a hand,&quot; he said at the beginning of a new
                        shuffle. He pulled up a chair and studied his cards. Those playing made that
                        quiet study of him which is so unapparent, and yet invariably so
                        searching.</p>
                    <p>Poor fortune was with him at first. He received a mixed collection without
                        progression or pairs. The pot was opened.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-405" n="399"/>
                    <p>&quot;I pass,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>On the strength of this, he was content to lose his ante. The deals did
                        fairly by him in the long run, causing him to come away with a few dollars
                        to the good.</p>
                    <p>The next afternoon he was back again, seeking amusement and profit. This time
                        he followed up three of a kind to his doom. There was a better hand across
                        the table, held by a pugnacious Irish youth, who was a political hanger-on
                        of the Tammany district in which they were located. Hurstwood was surprised
                        at the persistence of this individual, whose bets came with a <hi rend="i"
                            >sang-froid</hi> which, if a bluff, was excellent art. Hurstwood began
                        to doubt, but kept, or thought to keep, at least, the cool demeanour with
                        which, in olden times, he deceived those psychic students of the gaming
                        table, who seem to read thoughts and moods, rather than exterior evidences,
                        however subtle. He could not down the cowardly thought that this man had
                        something better and would stay to the end, drawing his last dollar into the
                        pot, should he choose to go so far. Still, he hoped to win muchhis hand was
                        excellent. Why not raise it five more?</p>
                    <p>&quot;I raise you three,&quot; said the youth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Make it five,&quot; said Hurstwood, pushing out his chips.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come again,&quot; said the youth, pushing out a small pile of
                        reds.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me have some more chips,&quot; said Hurstwood to the keeper
                        in charge, taking out a bill.</p>
                    <p>A cynical grin lit up the face of his youthful opponent. When the chips were
                        laid out, Hurstwood met the raise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Five again,&quot; said the youth.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood&apos;s brow was wet. He was deep in nowvery deep for him. Sixty
                        dollars of his good money was up. He was ordinarily no coward, but the
                        thought <pb id="VAA2423-406" n="400"/> of losing so much weakened him.
                        Finally he gave way. He would not trust to this fine hand any longer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I call,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A full house!&quot; said the youth, spreading out his
                        cards.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood&apos;s hand dropped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I had you,&quot; he said, weakly.</p>
                    <p>The youth raked in his chips, and Hurstwood came away, not without first
                        stopping to count his remaining cash on the stair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Three hundred and forty dollars,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>With this loss and ordinary expenses, so much had already gone.</p>
                    <p>Back in the flat, he decided he would play no more.</p>
                    <p>Remembering Mrs. Vance&apos;s promise to call, Carrie made one other mild
                        protest. It was concerning Hurstwood&apos;s appearance. This very day,
                        coming home, he changed his clothes to the old togs he sat around in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What makes you always put on those old clothes?&quot; asked
                        Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the use wearing my good ones around here?&quot;
                        he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I should think you&apos;d feel better.&quot; Then she
                        added: &quot;Some one might call.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Mrs. Vance,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She needn&apos;t see me,&quot; he answered, sullenly.</p>
                    <p>This lack of pride and interest made Carrie almost hate him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she thought, &quot;there he sits. &apos;She
                        needn&apos;t see me.&apos; I should think he would be ashamed of
                        himself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The real bitterness of this thing was added when Mrs. Vance did call. It was
                        on one of her shopping rounds. Making her way up the commonplace hall, she
                        knocked at Carrie&apos;s door. To her subsequent and <pb
                            id="VAA2423-407" n="401"/> agonising distress, Carrie was out. Hurstwood
                        opened the door, half-thinking that the knock was Carrie&apos;s. For
                        once, he was taken honestly aback. The lost voice of youth and pride spoke
                        in him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why,&quot; he said, actually stammering, &quot;how do you
                        do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you do?&quot; said Mrs. Vance, who could scarcely
                        believe her eyes. His great confusion she instantly perceived. He did not
                        know whether to invite her in or not.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is your wife at home?&quot; she inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;Carrie&apos;s out; but
                        won&apos;t you step in? She&apos;ll be back shortly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No-o,&quot; said Mrs. Vance, realising the change of it all.
                        &quot;I&apos;m really very much in a hurry. I thought I&apos;d
                        just run up and look in, but I couldn&apos;t stay. Just tell your wife
                        she must come and see me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will,&quot; said Hurstwood, standing back, and feeling
                        intense relief at her going. He was so ashamed that he folded his hands
                        weakly, as he sat in the chair after-wards, and thought.</p>
                    <p>Carrie, coming in from another direction, thought she saw Mrs. Vance going
                        away. She strained her eyes, but could not make sure.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was anybody here just now?&quot; she asked of Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said guiltily; &quot;Mrs.
                        Vance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did she see you?&quot; she asked, expressing her full
                        despair.</p>
                    <p>This cut Hurstwood like a whip, and made him sullen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If she had eyes, she did. I opened the door.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Carrie, closing one hand tightly out of sheer
                        nervousness. &quot;What did she have to say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; he answered. &quot;She couldn&apos;t
                        stay.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-408" n="402"/>
                    <p>&quot;And you looking like that!&quot; said Carrie, throwing aside a
                        long reserve.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What of it?&quot; he said, angering. &quot;I
                        didn&apos;t know she was coming, did I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You knew she might,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;I told you she
                        said she was coming. I&apos;ve asked you a dozen times to wear your
                        other clothes. Oh, I think this is just terrible.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, let up,&quot; he answered. &quot;What difference does
                        it make? You couldn&apos;t associate with her, anyway. They&apos;ve
                        got too much money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who said I wanted to?&quot; said Carrie, fiercely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you act like it, rowing around over my looks. You&apos;d
                        think I&apos;d committed&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie interrupted:</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s true,&quot; she said. &quot;I
                        couldn&apos;t if I wanted to, but whose fault is it? You&apos;re
                        very free to sit and talk about who I could associate with. Why
                        don&apos;t you get out and look for work?&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was a thunderbolt in camp.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s it to you?&quot; he said, rising, almost
                        fiercely. &quot;I pay the rent, don&apos;t I? I furnish
                        the&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you pay the rent,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;You talk as
                        if there was nothing else in the world but a flat to sit around in. You
                        haven&apos;t done a thing for three months except sit around and
                        interfere here. I&apos;d like to know what you married me
                        for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t marry you,&quot; he said, in a snarling
                        tone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d like to know what you did, then, in
                        Montreal?&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I didn&apos;t marry you,&quot; he answered.
                        &quot;You can get that out of your head. You talk as though you
                        didn&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at him a moment, her eyes distending. She had believed it was
                        all legal and binding enough.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-409" n="403"/>
                    <p>&quot;What did you lie to me for, then?&quot; she asked, fiercely.
                        &quot;What did you force me to run away with you for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her voice became almost a sob.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Force!&quot; he said, with curled lip. &quot;A lot of
                        forcing I did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Carrie, breaking under the strain, and turning.
                        &quot;Oh, oh!&quot; and she hurried into the front room.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was now hot and waked up. It was a great shaking up for him, both
                        mental and moral. He wiped his brow as he looked around, and then went for
                        his clothes and dressed. Not a sound came from Carrie; she ceased sobbing
                        when she heard him dressing. She thought, at first, with the faintest alarm,
                        of being left without moneynot of losing him, though he might be going away
                        permanently. She heard him open the top of the wardrobe and take out his
                        hat. Then the dining-room door closed, and she knew he had gone.</p>
                    <p>After a few moments of silence, she stood up, dry-eyed, and looked out the
                        window. Hurstwood was just strolling up the street, from the flat, toward
                        Sixth Avenue.</p>
                    <p>The latter made progress along Thirteenth and across Fourteenth Street to
                        Union Square.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look for work!&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Look for
                        work! She tells me to get out and look for work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He tried to shield himself from his own mental accusation, which told him
                        that she was right.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a cursed thing that &quot;Mrs. Vance&apos;s call was,
                        anyhow,&quot; he thought. &quot;Stood right there, and looked me
                        over. I know what she was thinking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He remembered the few times he had seen her in Seventy-eighth Street. She was
                        always a swell-looker, and he had tried to put on the air of being worthy of
                            <pb id="VAA2423-410" n="404"/> such as she, in front of her. Now, to
                        think she had caught him looking this way. He wrinkled his fore-head in his
                        distress.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The devil!&quot; he said a dozen times in an hour.</p>
                    <p>It was a quarter after four when he left the house. Carrie was in tears.
                        There would be no dinner that night.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What the deuce,&quot; he said, swaggering mentally to hide his
                        own shame from himself. &quot;I&apos;m not so bad. I&apos;m not
                        down yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked around the square, and seeing the several large hotels, decided to
                        go to one for dinner. He would get his papers and make himself comfortable,
                        there.</p>
                    <p>He ascended into the fine parlour of the Morton House, then one of the best
                        New York hotels, and, finding a cushioned seat, read. It did not trouble him
                        much that his decreasing sum of money did not allow of such extravagance.
                        Like the morphine fiend, he was becoming addicted to his ease. Anything to
                        relieve his mental distress, to satisfy his craving for comfort. He must do
                        it. No thoughts for the morrowhe could not stand to think of it any more
                        than he could of any other calamity. Like the certainty of death, he tried
                        to shut the certainty of soon being without a dollar completely out of his
                        mind, and he came very near doing it.</p>
                    <p>Well-dressed guests moving to and fro over the thick carpets carried him back
                        to the old days. A young lady, a guest of the house, playing a piano in an
                        alcove pleased him. He sat there reading.</p>
                    <p>His dinner cost him $1.50. By eight o&apos;clock he was through, and
                        then, seeing guests leaving and the crowd of pleasure-seekers thickening
                        outside, wondered where he should go. Not home. Carrie would <pb
                            id="VAA2423-411" n="405"/> be up. No, he would not go back there this
                        evening. He would stay out and knock around as a man who was independentnot
                        brokewell might. He bought a cigar, and went outside on the corner where
                        other individuals were loungingbrokers, racing people, thespianshis own
                        flesh and blood. As he stood there, he thought of the old evenings in
                        Chicago, and how he used to dispose of them. Many&apos;s the game he had
                        had. This took him to poker.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t do that thing right the other day,&quot; he
                        thought, referring to his loss of sixty dollars. &quot;I
                        shouldn&apos;t have weakened. I could have bluffed that fellow down. I
                        wasn&apos;t in form, that&apos;s what ailed me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then he studied the possibilities of the game as it had been played, and
                        began to figure how he might have won, in several instances, by bluffing a
                        little harder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m old enough to play poker and do something with it.
                        I&apos;ll try my hand to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Visions of a big stake floated before him. Supposing he did win a couple of
                        hundred, wouldn&apos;t he be in it? Lots of sports he knew made their
                        living at this game, and a good living, too.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They always had as much as I had,&quot; he thought.</p>
                    <p>So off he went to a poker room in the neighbourhood, feeling much as he had
                        in the old days. In this period of self-forgetfulness, aroused first by the
                        shock of argument and perfected by a dinner in the hotel, with cocktails and
                        cigars, he was as nearly like the old Hurstwood as he would ever be again.
                        It was not the old Hurstwoodonly a man arguing with a divided conscience and
                        lured by a phantom.</p>
                    <p>This poker room was much like the other one, only it was a back room in a
                        better drinking resort. Hurstwood watched a while, and then, seeing an
                        interesting game, joined in. As before, it went easy for a while, <pb
                            id="VAA2423-412" n="406"/> he winning a few times and cheering up,
                        losing a few pots and growing more interested and determined on that
                        account. At last the fascinating game took a strong hold on him. He enjoyed
                        its risks and ventured, on a trifling hand, to bluff the company and secure
                        a fair stake. To his self-satisfaction intense and strong, he did it.</p>
                    <p>In the height of this feeling he began to think his luck was with biro. No
                        one else had done so well. Now came another moderate hand, and again he
                        tried to open the jack-pot on it. There were others there who were almost
                        reading his heart, so close was their observation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have three of a kind,&quot; said one of the players to
                        himself. &quot;I&apos;ll just stay with that fellow to the
                        finish.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The result was that bidding began.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I raise you ten.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ten more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ten again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Right you are.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It got to where Hurstwood had seventy-five dollars up. The other man really
                        became serious. Perhaps this individual (Hurstwood) really did have a stiff
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I call,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood showed his hand. He was done. The bitter fact that he had lost
                        seventy-five dollars made him desperate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s have another pot,&quot; he said, grimly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said the man.</p>
                    <p>Some of the other players quit, but observant loungers took their places.
                        Time passed, and it came to twelve o&apos;clock. Hurstwood held on,
                        neither winning <pb id="VAA2423-413" n="407"/> nor losing much. Then he grew
                        weary, and on a last hand lost twenty more. He was sick at heart.</p>
                    <p>At a quarter after one in the morning he carne out of the place. The chill,
                        bare streets seemed a mockery of his state. He walked slowly west, little
                        thinking of his row with Carrie. He ascended the stairs and went into his
                        room as if there had been no trouble. It was his loss that occupied his
                        mind. Sitting down on the bedside he counted his money. There was now but a
                        hundred and ninety dollars and some change. He put it up and began to
                        undress.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder what&apos;s getting into use, anyhow?&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>In the morning Carrie scarcely spoke, and he felt as if he must go out again.
                        He had treated her badly, but he could not afford to make up. Now
                        desperation seized him, and for a day or two, going out thus, he lived like
                        a gentlemanor what he conceived to be a gentlemanwhich took money. For his
                        escapades he was soon poorer in mind and body, to say nothing of his purse,
                        which had lost thirty by the process. Then he came down to cold, bitter
                        sense again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The rent man comes to-day,&quot; said Carrie, greeting hits
                        thus indifferently three mornings later.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He does?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; this is the second,&quot; answered Carrie.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood frowned. Then in despair he got out his purse.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It seems an awful lot to pay for rent,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>He was nearing his last hundred dollars.</p>

                    <p>It would be useless to explain how in due time the last fifty dollars was in
                        sight. The seven hundred, by his process of handling, had only carried them
                        into June. Before the final hundred mark was reached he began to indicate
                        that a calamity was approaching.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he said one clay, taking a trivial
                        expenditure for meat as a text, &quot;it seems to take an awful lot for
                        us to live.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It doesn&apos;t seem to me,&quot; said Carrie,
                        &quot;that we spend very much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My money is nearly gone,&quot; he said, &quot;and I hardly
                        know where it&apos;s gone to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All that seven hundred dollars?&quot; asked Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All but a hundred.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked so disconsolate that it scared her. She began to see that she
                        herself had been drifting. She had felt it all the time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, George,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;why don&apos;t
                        you get out and look for something? You could find something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have looked,&quot; he said. &quot;You can&apos;t make
                        people give you a place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gazed weakly at him and said: &quot;Well, what do you think you will
                        do? A hundred dollars won&apos;t last long.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he said. &quot;I
                        can&apos;t do any more than look.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-415" n="409"/>
                    <p>Carrie became frightened over this announcement. She thought desperately upon
                        the subject. Frequently she had considered the stage as a door through which
                        she might enter that gilded state which she had so much craved. Now, as in
                        Chicago, it came as a last resource in distress. Something must be done if
                        he did not get work soon. Perhaps she would have to go out and battle again
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>She began to wonder how one would go about getting a place. Her experience in
                        Chicago proved that she had not tried the right way. There must be people
                        who would listen to and try youmen who would give you an opportunity.</p>
                    <p>They were talking at the breakfast table, a morning or two later, when she
                        brought up the dramatic subject by saying that she saw that Sarah Bernhardt
                        was coming to this country. Hurstwood had seen it, too.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do people get on the stage, George?&quot; she finally
                        asked, innocently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he said. &quot;There must be
                        dramatic agents.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie was sipping coffee, and did not look up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Regular people who get you a place?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I think so,&quot; he answered.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly the air with which she asked attracted his attention.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re not still thinking about being an actress, are
                        you?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she answered, &quot;I was just
                        wondering.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Without being clear, there was something in the thought which he objected to.
                        He did not believe any more, after three years of observation, that Carrie
                        would ever do anything great in that line. She seemed too simple, too
                        yielding. His idea of the art was that it <pb id="VAA2423-416" n="410"/>
                        involved something more pompous. If she tried to get on the stage she would
                        fall into the hands of some cheap manager and become like the rest of them.
                        He had a good idea of what he meant by <hi rend="i">them</hi>. Carrie was
                        pretty. She would get along all right, but where would he be?</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d get that idea out of my head, if I were you.
                        It&apos;s a lot more difficult than you think.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie felt this to contain, in some way, an aspersion upon her ability.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You said I did real well in Chicago,&quot; she rejoined.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You did,&quot; he answered, seeing that he was arousing
                        opposition, &quot;but Chicago isn&apos;t New York, by a big
                        jump.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie did not answer this at all. It hurt her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The stage,&quot; he went on, &quot;is all right if you can
                        be one of the big guns, but there&apos;s nothing to the rest of it. It
                        takes a long while to get up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Carrie, slightly
                        aroused.</p>
                    <p>In a flash, he thought he foresaw the result of this thing. Now, when the
                        worst of his situation was approaching, she would get on the stage in some
                        cheap way and forsake him. Strangely, he had not conceived well of her
                        mental ability. That was because he did not understand the nature of
                        emotional greatness. He had never learned that a person might be
                        emotionallyinstead of intellectuallygreat. Avery Hall was too far away for
                        him to look back and sharply remember. He had lived with this woman too
                        long.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I do,&quot; he answered. &quot;If I were you I
                        wouldn&apos;t think of it. It&apos;s not much of a profession for a
                        woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s better than going hungry,&quot; said Carrie.
                        &quot;If you don&apos;t want me to do that, why don&apos;t you
                        get work yourself?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-417" n="411"/>
                    <p>There was no answer ready for this. He had got used to the suggestion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, let up,&quot; he answered.</p>
                    <p>The result of this was that she secretly resolved to try. It didn&apos;t
                        matter about him. She was not going to be dragged into poverty and something
                        worse to suit him. She could act. She could get something and then work up.
                        What would he say then? She pictured herself already appearing in some fine
                        performance on Broadway; of going every evening to her dressing-room and
                        making up. Then she would come out at eleven o&apos;clock and see the
                        carriages ranged about, waiting for the people. It did not matter whether
                        she was the star or not. If she were only once in, getting a decent salary,
                        wearing the kind of clothes she liked, having the money to do with, going
                        here and there as she pleased, how delightful it would all be. Her mind ran
                        over this picture all the day long. Hurstwood&apos;s dreary state made
                        its beauty become more and more vivid.</p>
                    <p>Curiously this idea soon took hold of Hurstwood. His vanishing stun suggested
                        that he would need sustenance. Why could not Carrie assist him a little
                        until he could get something?</p>
                    <p>He came in one day with something of this idea in his mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I met John B. Drake to-day,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;He&apos;s going to open a hotel here in the fall. He says that
                        he can make a place for me then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who is he?&quot; asked Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s the man that runs the Grand Pacific in
                        Chicago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d get about fourteen hundred a year out of
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-418" n="412"/>
                    <p>&quot;That would be good, wouldn&apos;t it?&quot; she said,
                        sympathetically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I can only get over this summer,&quot; he added, &quot;I
                        think I&apos;ll be all right. I&apos;m hearing from some of my
                        friends again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carri swallowed this story in all its pristine beauty. She sincerely wished
                        he could get through the summer. He looked so hopeless.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much money have you left?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Only fifty dollars.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, mercy,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;what will we do?
                        It&apos;s only twenty days until the rent will be due
                        again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood rested his head on his hands and looked blankly at the floor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe you could get something in the stage line?&quot; he
                        blandly suggested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe I could,&quot; said Carrie, glad that some one approved
                        of the idea.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll lay my hand to whatever I can get,&quot; he said,
                        now that he saw her brighten up. &quot;I can get
                        something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She cleaned up the things one morning after he had gone, dressed as neatly as
                        her wardrobe permitted, and set out for Broadway. She did not know that
                        thorough-fare very well. To her it was a wonderful conglomeration of
                        everything great and mighty. The theatres were therethese agencies must be
                        somewhere about.</p>
                    <p>She decided to stop in at the Madison Square Theatre and ask how to find the
                        theatrical agents. This seemed the sensible way. Accordingly, when she
                        reached that theatre she applied to the clerk at the box office.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Eh?&quot; he said, looking out. &quot;Dramatic agents? I
                        don&apos;t know. You&apos;ll find them in the
                        &apos;Clipper,&apos; though. They all advertise in
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that a paper?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-419" n="413"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the clerk, marvelling at such ignorance of a
                        common fact. &quot;You can get it at the news-stands,&quot; he added
                        politely, seeing how pretty the inquirer was.</p>
                    <p>Carrie proceeded to get the &quot;Clipper,&quot; and tried to find
                        the agents by looking over it as she stood beside the stand. This could not
                        be done so easily. Thirteenth Street was a number of blocks off, but site
                        went back, carrying the precious paper and regretting the waste of time.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was already there, sitting in his place.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where were you?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve been trying to find sonic dramatic
                        agents.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He felt a little diffident about asking concerning her success. The paper she
                        began to scan attracted his attention.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What have you got there?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The &apos;Clipper.&apos; The man said I&apos;d find
                        their addresses in here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you been all the way over to Broadway to find that out? I
                        could have told you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why didn&apos;t you?&quot; she asked, without looking
                        up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You never asked me,&quot; he returned.</p>
                    <p>She went hunting aimlessly through the crowded columns. Her mind was
                        distracted by this man&apos;s indifference. The difficulty of the
                        situation she was facing was only added to by all he did. Self-commiseration
                        brewed in her heart. Tears trembled along her eyelids but did not fall.
                        Hurstwood noticed something.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me look.&quot;</p>
                    <p>To recover herself site went into the front room while he searched. Presently
                        she returned. He had a pencil, and was writing upon an envelope.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here &apos;re three,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Carrie took it and found that one was Mrs. Bermudez, <pb id="VAA2423-420"
                            n="414"/> another Marcus Jenks, a third Percy Weil. She paused only a
                        moment, and then moved toward the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I might as well go right away,&quot; she said, without looking
                        back.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood saw her depart with some faint stirrings of shame, which were the
                        expression of a manhood rapidly becoming stultified. He sat a while, and
                        then it became too much. He got up and put on his hat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess I&apos;ll go out,&quot; he said to himself, and
                        went, strolling nowhere in particular, but feeling somehow that he must
                        go.</p>
                    <p>Carrie&apos;s first call was upon Mrs. Bermudez, whose address was quite
                        the nearest. It was an old-fashioned residence turned into offices. Mrs.
                        Bermudez&apos;s offices consisted of what formerly had been a back
                        chamber and a hall bedroom, marked &quot;Private.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As Carrie entered she noticed several persons lounging aboutmen, who said
                        nothing and did nothing.</p>
                    <p>While she was waiting to be noticed, the door of the hall bedroom opened and
                        from it issued two very mannish-looking women, very tightly dressed, and
                        wearing white collars and cuffs. After them came a portly lady of about
                        forty-five, light-haired, sharp-eyed, and evidently good-natured. At least
                        she was smiling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, don&apos;t forget about that,&quot; said one of the
                        mannish women.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t,&quot; said the portly woman.
                        &quot;Let&apos;s see,&quot; she added, &quot;where are you
                        the first week in February?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pittsburg,&quot; said the woman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll write you there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said the other, and the two passed out.</p>
                    <p>Instantly the portly lady&apos;s face became exceedingly sober and
                        shrewd. She turned about and fixed on Carrie a very searching eye.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-421" n="415"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;young woman, what can I do for
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you Mrs. Bermudez?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Carrie, hesitating how to begin, &quot;do
                        you get places for persons upon the stage?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Could you get use one?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you ever had any experience?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A very little,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whom did you play with?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, with no one,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;It was just a
                        show gotten&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; said the woman, interrupting her.
                        &quot;No, I don&apos;t know of anything now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie&apos;s countenance fell.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You want to get some New York experience,&quot; concluded the
                        affable Mrs. Bermudez. &quot;We&apos;ll take your name,
                        though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie stood looking while the lady retired to her office.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is your address?&quot; inquired a young lady behind the
                        counter, taking up the curtailed conversation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mrs. George Wheeler,&quot; said Carrie, moving over to where
                        she was writing. The woman wrote her address in full and then allowed her to
                        depart at her leisure.</p>
                    <p>She encountered a very similar experience in the office of Mr. Jenks, only he
                        varied it by saying at the close: &quot;If you could play at some local
                        house, or had a programme with your name on it, I might do
                        some-thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the third place the individual asked:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What sort of work do you want to do?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-422" n="416"/>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, do you want to get in a comedy or on the vaudeville stage or
                        in the chorus?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;d like to get a part in a play,&quot; said
                        Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the man, &quot;it&apos;ll cost you
                        something to do that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much?&quot; said Carrie, who, ridiculous as it may seem,
                        had not thought of this before.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s for you to say,&quot; he answered
                        shrewdly.</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at him curiously. She hardly knew how to continue the
                        inquiry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Could you get me a part if I paid?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If we didn&apos;t you&apos;d get your money
                        back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>The agent saw he was dealing with an inexperienced soul, and continued
                        accordingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d want to deposit fifty dollars, any way. No agent
                        would trouble about you for less than that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie saw a light.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said. &quot;I&apos;ll think about
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She started to go, and then bethought herself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How soon would I get a place?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s hard to say,&quot; said the man.
                        &quot;You might get one in a week, or it might be a month.
                        You&apos;d get the first thing that we thought you could
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see,&quot; said Carrie, and then, half-smiling to be
                        agreeable, she walked out.</p>
                    <p>The agent studied a moment, and then said to himself:</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s funny how anxious these women are to get on the
                        stage.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie found ample food for reflection in the fifty-dollar proposition.
                        &quot;Maybe they&apos;d take my money and not give me
                        anything,&quot; she thought. She had some jewelrya diamond ring and pin
                        and several other pieces. <pb id="VAA2423-423" n="417"/> She could get fifty
                        dollars for those if she went to a pawnbroker.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood was home before her. He had not thought she would be so long
                        seeking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well?&quot; he said, not venturing to ask what news.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t find out anything to-day,&quot; said Carrie,
                        taking off her gloves. &quot;They all want money to get you a
                        place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much?&quot; asked Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fifty dollars.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They don&apos;t want anything, do they?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, they&apos;re like everybody else. You can&apos;t tell
                        whether they&apos;d ever get you anything after you did pay
                        them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I wouldn&apos;t put up fifty on that basis,&quot;
                        said Hurstwood, as if he were deciding, money in hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;I think
                        I&apos;ll try some of the managers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood heard this, dead to the horror of it. He rocked a little to and
                        fro, and chewed at his finger. It seemed all very natural in such extreme
                        states. He would do better later on.</p>

                    <p>When Carrie renewed her search, as she did the next day, going to the Casino,
                        she found that in the opera chorus, as in other fields, employment is
                        difficult to secure. Girls who can stand in a line and look pretty are as
                        numerous as labourers who can swing a pick. She found there was no
                        discrimination between one and the other of applicants, save as regards a
                        conventional standard of prettiness and form. Their own opinion or knowledge
                        of their ability went for nothing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where shall I find Mr. Gray?&quot; she asked of a sulky doorman
                        at the stage entrance of the Casino.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can&apos;t see him now; he&apos;s busy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you know when I can see him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Got an appointment with him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you&apos;ll have to call at his office.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; exclaimed Carrie. &quot;Where is his
                        office?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He gave her the number.</p>
                    <p>She knew there was no need of calling there now. He would not be in. Nothing
                        remained but to employ the intermediate hours in search.</p>
                    <p>The dismal story of ventures in other places is quickly told. Mr. Daly saw no
                        one save by appointment. Carrie waited an hour in a dingy office, quite in
                        spite of obstacles, to learn this fact of the placid, indifferent Mr.
                        Dorney.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-425" n="419"/>
                    <p>&quot;You will have to write and ask him to see you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>So she went away.</p>
                    <p>At the Empire Theatre she found a hive of peculiarly listless and indifferent
                        individuals. Everything ornately upholstered, everything carefully finished,
                        everything remarkably reserved.</p>
                    <p>At the Lyceum she entered one of those secluded, under-stairway closets,
                        berugged and bepanneled, which causes one to feel the greatness of all
                        positions of authority. Here was reserve itself done into a box-office
                        clerk, a doorman, and an assistant, glorying in their fine positions.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, be very humble nowvery humble indeed. Tell us what it is you
                        require. Tell it quickly, nervously, and without a vestige of self-respect.
                        If no trouble to us in any way, we may see what we can do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was the atmosphere of the Lyceumthe attitude, for that matter, of every
                        managerial office in the city. These little proprietors of businesses are
                        lords indeed on their own ground.</p>
                    <p>Carrie came away wearily, somewhat more abashed for her pains.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood heard the details of the weary and unavailing search that
                        evening.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t get to see any one,&quot; said Carrie.
                        &quot;I just walked, and walked, and waited around.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood only looked at her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose you have to have some friends before you can get
                        in,&quot; she added, disconsolately.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood saw the difficulty of this thing, and yet it did not seem so
                        terrible. Carrie was tired and dispirited, but now she could rest. Viewing
                        the world from his rocking-chair, its bitterness did not seem to approach so
                        rapidly. To-morrow was another day.</p>
                    <p>To-morrow came, and the next, and the next.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-426" n="420"/>
                    <p>Carrie saw the manager at the Casino once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come around,&quot; he said, &quot;the first of next week. I
                        may make some changes then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was a large and corpulent individual, surfeited with good clothes and good
                        eating, who judged women as another would horseflesh. Carrie was pretty and
                        graceful. She might be put in even if she did not have any experience. One
                        of the proprietors had suggested that the chorus was a little weak on
                        looks.</p>
                    <p>The first of next week was some days off yet. The first of the month was
                        drawing near. Carrie began to worry as she had never worried before.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you really look for anything when you go out?&quot; she
                        asked Hurstwood one morning as a climax to some painful thoughts of her
                        own.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course I do,&quot; he said pettishly, troubling only a
                        little over the disgrace of the insinuation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d take anything,&quot; she said, &quot;for the
                        present. It will soon be the first of the month again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked the picture of despair.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood quit reading his paper and changed his clothes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He would look for something,&quot; he thought. &quot;He
                        would go and see if some brewery couldn&apos;t get him in somewhere.
                        Yes, he would take a position as bartender, if he could get
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was the same sort of pilgrimage he had made before. One or two slight
                        rebuffs; and the bravado disappeared.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No use,&quot; he thought. &quot;I might as well go on back
                        home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Now that his money was so low, he began to observe his clothes and feel that
                        even his best ones were beginning to look commonplace. This was a bitter
                        thought.</p>
                    <p>Carrie came in after he did.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-427" n="421"/>
                    <p>&quot;I went to see some of the variety managers,&quot; she said,
                        aimlessly. &quot;You have to have an act. They don&apos;t want
                        anybody that hasn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw some of the brewery people to-day,&quot; said Hurstwood.
                        &quot;One man told me he&apos;d try to make a place for me in two or
                        three weeks.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the face of so much distress on Carrie&apos;s part, he had to make
                        some showing, and it was thus he did so. It was lassitude&apos;s apology
                        to energy.</p>
                    <p>Monday Carrie went again to the Casino.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did I tell you to come around to-day?&quot; said the manager,
                        looking her over as she stood before him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You said the first of the week,&quot; said Carrie, greatly
                        abashed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ever had any experience?&quot; he asked again, almost
                        severely.</p>
                    <p>Carrie owned to ignorance.</p>
                    <p>He looked her over again as he stirred among some papers. He was secretly
                        pleased with this pretty, disturbed-looking young woman. &quot;Come
                        around to the theatre to-morrow morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie&apos;s heart bounded to her throat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will,&quot; she said with difficulty. She could see he wanted
                        her, and turned to go.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would he really put her to work? Oh, blessed fortune, could it
                        be?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Already the hard rumble of the city through the open windows became
                        pleasant.</p>
                    <p>A sharp voice answered her mental interrogation, driving away all immediate
                        fears on that score.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be sure you&apos;re there promptly,&quot; the manager said
                        roughly. &quot;You&apos;ll be dropped if you&apos;re
                        not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie hastened away. She did not quarrel now with Hurstwood&apos;s
                        idleness. She had a placeshe had a place! This sang in her ears.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-428" n="422"/>
                    <p>In her delight she was almost anxious to tell Hurstwood. But, as she walked
                        homeward, and her survey of the facts of the case became larger, she began
                        to think of the anomaly of her finding work in several weeks and his
                        lounging in idleness for a number of months.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t he get something?&quot; she openly said to
                        herself. &quot;If I can he surely ought to. It wasn&apos;t very hard
                        for me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She forgot her youth and her beauty. The handicap of age she did not, in her
                        enthusiasm, perceive.</p>
                    <p>Thus, ever, the voice of success.</p>
                    <p>Still, she could not keep her secret. She tried to be calm and indifferent,
                        but it was a palpable sham.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well?&quot; he said, seeing her relieved face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have a place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have?&quot; he said, breathing a better breath.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What sort of a place is it?&quot; he asked, feeling in his
                        veins as if now he might get something good also.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In the chorus,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it the Casino show you told me about?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered. &quot;I begin rehearsing
                        tomorrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was more explanation volunteered by Carrie, because she was happy. At
                        last Hurstwsood said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you know how much you&apos;ll get?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I didn&apos;t want to ask,&quot; said Carrie.
                        &quot;I guess they pay twelve or fourteen dollars a week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;About that, I guess,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>There was a good dinner in the flat that evening, owing to the mere lifting
                        of the terrible strain. Hurstwood went out for a shave, and returned with a
                        fairsized sirloin steak.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, to-morrow,&quot; he thought, &quot;I&apos;ll look
                        around <pb id="VAA2423-429" n="423"/> myself,&quot; and with renewed
                        hope he lifted his eyes from the ground.</p>
                    <p>On the morrow Carrie reported promptly and was given a place in the line. She
                        saw a large, empty, shadowy play-house, still redolent of the perfumes and
                        blazonry of the night, and notable for its rich, oriental appearance. The
                        wonder of it awed and delighted her. Blessed be its wondrous reality. How
                        hard she would try to be worthy of it. It was above the common mass, above
                        idleness, above want, above insignificance. People came to it in finery and
                        carriages to see. It was ever a centre of light and mirth. And here she was
                        of it. Oh, if she could only remain, how happy would be her days!</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is your name?&quot; said the manager, who was conducting
                        the drill.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Madenda,&quot; she replied, instantly mindful of the name
                        Drouet had selected in Chicago. &quot;Carrie Madenda.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, now, Miss Madenda,&quot; he said, very affably, as Carrie
                        thought, &quot;you go over there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then he called to a young woman who was already of the company:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Clark, you pair with Miss Madenda.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This young lady stepped forward, so that Carrie saw where to go, and the
                        rehearsal began.</p>
                    <p>Carrie soon found that while this drilling had some slight resemblance to the
                        rehearsals as conducted at Avery Hall, the attitude of the manager was much
                        more pronounced. She had marvelled at the insistence and superior airs of
                        Mr. Millice, but the individual conducting here had the same insistence,
                        coupled with almost brutal roughness. As the drilling proceeded, he seemed
                        to wax exceedingly wroth over trifles, and to increase his lung power in
                        proportion. It was very <pb id="VAA2423-430" n="424"/> evident that he had a
                        great contempt for any assumption of dignity or innocence on the part of
                        these young women.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Clark,&quot; he would callmeaning, of course, Miss
                        Clark&quot; why don&apos;t you catch step there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;By fours, right! Right, I said, right! For heaven&apos;s sake,
                        get on to yourself! Right!&quot; and in saying this he would lift the
                        last sounds into a vehement roar.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maitland! Maitland!&quot; he called once.</p>
                    <p>A nervous, comely-dressed little girl stepped out. Carrie trembled for her
                        out of the fulness of her own sympathies and fear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Miss Maitland.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is there anything the matter with your ears?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you know what &apos;column left&apos;
                        means?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what are you stumbling around the right for? Want to break up
                        the line?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was just&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind what you were just. Keep your ears open.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie pitied, and trembled for her turn.</p>
                    <p>Yet another suffered the pain of personal rebuke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold on a minute,&quot; cried the manager, throwing up his
                        hands, as if in despair. His demeanour was fierce.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elvers,&quot; he shouted, &quot;what have you got in your
                        mouth?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Miss Elvers, while some smiled and stood
                        nervously by.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, are you talking?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, keep your mouth still then. Now, all together
                        again.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-431" n="425"/>
                    <p>At last Carrie&apos;s turn came. It was because of her extreme anxiety to
                        do all that was required that brought on the trouble.</p>
                    <p>She heard some one called.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mason,&quot; said the voice. &quot;Miss
                        Mason.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked around to see who it could be. A girl behind shoved her a little,
                        but she did not understand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You, you!&quot; said the manager. &quot;Can&apos;t you
                        hear?&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; said Carrie, collapsing, and
                        blushing fiercely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t your name Mason?&quot; asked the manager.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; said Carrie, &quot;it&apos;s
                        Madenda.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what&apos;s the matter with your feet? Can&apos;t you
                        dance?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Carrie, who had long since learned this
                        art.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you do it then? Don&apos;t go shuffling
                        along as if you were dead. I&apos;ve got to have people with life in
                        them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie&apos;s cheek burned with a crimson heat. Her lips trembled a
                        little.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>It was this constant urging, coupled with irascibility and energy, for three
                        long hours. Carrie came away worn enough in body, but too excited in mind to
                        notice it. She meant to go home and practise her evolutions as prescribed.
                        She would not err in any way, if she could help it.</p>
                    <p>When she reached the flat Hurstwood was not there. For a wonder he was out
                        looking for work, as she supposed. She took only a mouthful to eat and then
                        practised on, sustained by visions of freedom from financial
                        distress&quot;The sound of glory ringing in her ears.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When Hurstwood returned he was not so elated as when he went away, and now
                        she was obliged to drop <pb id="VAA2423-432" n="426"/> practice and get
                        dinner. Here was an early irritation. She would have her work and this. Was
                        she going to act and keep house?</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not do it,&quot; she said, &quot;after I get
                        started. He can take his meals out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Each day thereafter brought its cares. She found it was not such a wonderful
                        thing to be in the chorus, and she also learned that her salary would be
                        twelve dollars a week. After a few days she had her first sight of those
                        high and mightiesthe leading ladies and gentlemen. She saw that they were
                        privileged and deferred to. She was nothingabsolutely nothing at all.</p>
                    <p>At home was Hurstwood, daily giving her cause for thought. He seemed to get
                        nothing to do, and yet he made bold to inquire how she was getting along.
                        The regularity with which he did this smacked of some one who was waiting to
                        live upon her labour. Now that she had a visible means of support, this
                        irritated her. He seemed to be depending upon her little twelve dollars.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How are you getting along?&quot; he would blandly inquire.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, all right,&quot; she would reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Find it easy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It will be all right when I get used to it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His paper would then engross his thoughts.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I got some lard,&quot; he would add, as an afterthought.
                        &quot;I thought maybe you might want to make some biscuit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The calm suggestion of the man astonished her a little, especially in the
                        light of recent developments. Her dawning independence gave her more courage
                        to observe, and she felt as if she wanted to say things. Still she could not
                        talk to him as she had to Drouet. There was something in the man&apos;s
                        manner of which she <pb id="VAA2423-433" n="427"/> had always stood in awe.
                        He seemed to have some invisible strength in reserve.</p>
                    <p>One day, after her first week&apos;s rehearsal, what she expected came
                        openly to the surface.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll have to be rather saving,&quot; he said, laying
                        down some meat he had purchased. &quot;You won&apos;t get any money
                        for a week or so yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Carrie, who was stirring a pan at the stove.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve only got the rent and thirteen dollars
                        more,&quot; he added.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s it,&quot; she said to herself.
                        &quot;I&apos;m to use my money now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Instantly she remembered that she had hoped to buy a few things for herself.
                        She needed clothes. Her hat was not nice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What will twelve dollars do towards keeping up this flat?&quot;
                        she thought. &quot;I can&apos;t do it. Why doesn&apos;t he get
                        something to do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The important night of the first real performance came. She did not suggest
                        to Hurstwood that he come and see. He did not think of going. It would only
                        be money wasted. She had such a small part.</p>
                    <p>The advertisements were already in the papers; the posters upon the
                        bill-boards. The leading lady and many members were cited. Carrie was
                        nothing.</p>
                    <p>As in Chicago, she was seized with stage fright as the very first entrance of
                        the ballet approached, but later she recovered. The apparent and painful
                        insignificance of the part took fear away from her. She felt that she was no
                        obscure it did not matter. Fortunately, she did not have to wear tights. A
                        group of twelve were assigned pretty golden-hued skirts which came only to a
                        line about an inch above the knee. Carrie happened to be one of the
                        twelve.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-434" n="428"/>
                    <p>In standing about the stage, marching, and occasionally lifting up her voice
                        in the general chorus, she had a chance to observe the audience and to see
                        the inauguration of a great hit. There was plenty of applause, but she could
                        not help noting how poorly some of the women of alleged ability did.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I could do better than that,&quot; Carrie ventured to herself,
                        in several instances. To do her justice, she was right.</p>
                    <p>After it was over she dressed quickly, and as the manager had scolded some
                        others and passed her, she imagined she must have proved satisfactory. She
                        wanted to get out quickly, because she knew but few, and the stars were
                        gossiping. Outside were carriages and some correct youths in attractive
                        clothing, waiting. Carrie saw that she was scanned closely. The flutter of
                        an eyelash would have brought her a companion. That she did not give.</p>
                    <p>One experienced youth volunteered, anyhow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not going home alone, are you?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Carrie merely hastened her steps and took the Sixth Avenue car. Her head was
                        so full of the wonder of it that she had time for nothing else.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you hear any more from the brewery?&quot; she asked at the
                        end of the week, hoping by the question to stir him on to action.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he answered, &quot;they&apos;re not quite
                        ready yet. I think something will come of that, though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She said nothing more then, objecting to giving up her own money, and yet
                        feeling that such would have to be the case. Hurstwood felt the crisis, and
                        artfully decided to appeal to Carrie. He had long since realised how
                        good-natured she was, how much she would stand. There was some little shame
                        in him at the thought of doing so, but he justified himself with the thought
                        that <pb id="VAA2423-435" n="429"/> he really would get something. Rent day
                        gave him his opportunity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, as he counted it out,
                        &quot;that&apos;s about the last of my money. I&apos;ll have to
                        get something pretty soon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at him askance, half-suspicious of an appeal.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I could only hold out a little longer I think I could get
                        something. Drake is sure to open a hotel here in September.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is he?&quot; said Carrie, thinking of the short month that
                        still remained until that time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would you mind helping me out until then?&quot; he said
                        appealingly. &quot;I think I&apos;ll be all right after that
                        time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Carrie, feeling sadly handicapped by fate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We can get along if we economise. I&apos;ll pay you back all
                        right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;ll help you,&quot; said Carrie, feeling quite
                        hard-hearted at thus forcing him to humbly appeal, and yet her desire for
                        the benefit of her earnings wrung a faint protest from her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you take anything, George,
                        temporarily?&quot; she said. &quot;What difference does it make?
                        Maybe, after a while, you&apos;ll get something better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will take anything,&quot; he said, relieved, and wincing
                        under reproof. &quot;I&apos;d just as leave dig on the streets.
                        Nobody knows me here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you needn&apos;t do that,&quot; said Carrie, hurt by
                        the pity of it. &quot;But there must be other things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll get something!&quot; he said, assuming
                        determination.</p>
                    <p>Then he went back to his paper.</p>
                </div2>
                <pb id="VAA2423-436" n="[430]"/>

                    <head type="subtitle">OF LIGHTS AND OF SHADOWS: THE PARTING OF WORLDS</head>
                    <p>What Hurstwood got as the result of this determination was more
                        self-assurance that each particular day was not the day. At the same time,
                        Carrie passed through thirty days of mental distress.</p>
                    <p>Her need of clothesto say nothing of her desire for ornamentsgrew rapidly as
                        the fact developed that for all her work she was not to have them. The
                        sympathy she felt for Hurstwood, at the time he asked her to tide him over,
                        vanished with these newer urgings of decency. He was not always renewing his
                        request, but this love of good appearance was. It insisted, and Carrie
                        wished to satisfy it, wished more and more that Hurstwood was not in the
                        way.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood reasoned, when he neared the last ten dollars, that he had better
                        keep a little pocket change and not become wholly dependent for car-fare,
                        shaves, and the like; so when this sum was still in his hand he announced
                        himself as penniless.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m clear out,&quot; he said to Carrie one afternoon.
                        &quot;I paid for some coal this morning, and that took all but ten or
                        fifteen cents.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve got some money there in my purse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood went to get it, starting for a can of tomatoes. Carrie scarcely
                        noticed that this was the beginning of the new order. He took out fifteen
                        cents and bought the can with it. Thereafter it was dribs and drabs of this
                        sort, until one morning Carrie suddenly <pb id="VAA2423-437" n="431"/>
                        remembered that she would not be back until close to dinner time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;re all out of flour,&quot; she said;
                        &quot;you&apos;d better get some this afternoon. We haven&apos;t
                        any meat, either. How would it do if we had liver and bacon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Suits me,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better get a half or three-quarters of a pound of
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Half &apos;ll be enough,&quot; volunteered Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>She opened her purse and laid down a half dollar. He pretended not to notice
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood bought the flourwhich all grocers sold in 31/2-pound packagesfor
                        thirteen cents and paid fifteen cents for a half-pound of liver and bacon.
                        He left the packages, together with the balance of thirty-two cents, upon
                        the kitchen table, where Carrie found it. It did not escape her that the
                        change was accurate. There was something sad in realising that, after all,
                        all that he wanted of her was something to eat. She felt as if hard thoughts
                        were unjust. Maybe he would get something yet. He had no vices.</p>
                    <p>That very evening, however, on going into the theatre, one of the chorus
                        girls passed her all newly arrayed in a pretty mottled tweed suit, which
                        took Carrie&apos;s eye. The young woman wore a fine bunch of violets and
                        seemed in high spirits. She smiled at Carrie good-naturedly as she passed,
                        showing pretty, even teeth, and Carrie smiled back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She can afford to dress well,&quot; thought Carrie,
                        &quot;and so could I, if I could only keep my money. I haven&apos;t
                        a decent tie of any kind to wear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She put out her foot and looked at her shoe reflectively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll get a pair of shoes Saturday, anyhow; I
                        don&apos;t care what happens.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-438" n="432"/>
                    <p>One of the sweetest and most sympathetic little chorus girls in the company
                        made friends with her because in Carrie she found nothing to frighten her
                        away. She was a gay little Manon, unwitting of society&apos;s fierce
                        conception of morality, but, nevertheless, good to her neighbour and
                        charitable. Little license was allowed the chorus in the matter of
                        conversation, but, nevertheless, some was indulged in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s warm to-night, isn&apos;t it?&quot; said this
                        girl, arrayed in pink fleshings and an imitation golden helmet. She also
                        carried a shining shield.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; it is,&quot; said Carrie, pleased that some one should
                        talk to her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m almost roasting,&quot; said the girl.</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked into her pretty face, with its large blue eyes, and saw little
                        beads of moisture.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s more marching in this opera than ever I did
                        before,&quot; added the girl.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you been in others?&quot; asked Carrie, surprised at her
                        experience.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lots of them,&quot; said the girl; &quot;haven&apos;t
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is my first experience.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, is it? I thought I saw you the time they ran &apos;The
                        Queen&apos;s Mate&apos; here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Carrie, shaking her head; &quot;not
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This conversation was interrupted by the blare of the orchestra and the
                        sputtering of the calcium lights in the wings as the line was called to form
                        for a new entrance. No further opportunity for conversation occurred, but
                        the next evening, when they were getting ready for the stage, this girl
                        appeared anew at her side.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They say this show is going on the road next month.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-439" n="433"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; do you think you&apos;ll go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know; I guess so, if they&apos;ll take
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, they&apos;ll take you. I wouldn&apos;t go. They
                        won&apos;t give you any more, and it will cost you everything you make
                        to live. I never leave New York. There are too many shows going on
                        here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can you always get in another show?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I always have. There&apos;s one going on up at the Broadway
                        this month. I&apos;m going to try and get in that if this one really
                        goes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie heard this with aroused intelligence. Evidently it wasn&apos;t so
                        very difficult to get on. Maybe she also could get a place if this show went
                        away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do they all pay about the same?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. Sometimes you get a little more. This show doesn&apos;t
                        pay very much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I get twelve,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you?&quot; said the girl. &quot;They pay me fifteen, and
                        you do more work than I do. I wouldn&apos;t stand it if I were you.
                        They&apos;re just giving you less because they think you don&apos;t
                        know. You ought to be making fifteen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m not,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you&apos;ll get more at the next place if you want
                        it,&quot; went on the girl, who admired Carrie very much.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You do fine, and the manager knows it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>To say the truth, Carrie did unconsciously move about with an air pleasing
                        and somewhat distinctive. It was due wholly to her natural manner and total
                        lack of self-consciousness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you suppose I could get more up at the Broadway?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course you can,&quot; answered the girl. &quot;You come
                        with me when I go. I&apos;ll do the talking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie heard this, flushing with thankfulness. She <pb id="VAA2423-440"
                            n="434"/> liked this little gaslight soldier. She seemed so experienced
                        and self-reliant in her tinsel helmet and military accoutrements.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My future must be assured if I can always get work this
                        way,&quot; thought Carrie.</p>
                    <p>Still, in the morning, when her household duties would infringe upon her and
                        Hurstwood sat there, a perfect load to contemplate, her fate seemed dismal
                        and unrelieved. It did not take so very much to feed them under
                        Hurstwood&apos;s close-measured buying, and there would possibly be
                        enough for rent, but it left nothing else. Carrie bought the shoes and some
                        other things, which complicated the rent problem very seriously. Suddenly, a
                        week from the fatal day, Carrie realised that they were going to run
                        short.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t believe,&quot; she exclaimed, looking into her
                        purse at breakfast, &quot;that I&apos;ll have enough to pay the
                        rent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much have you?&quot; inquired Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ve got twenty-two dollars, but there&apos;s
                        everything to be paid for this week yet, and if I use all I get Saturday to
                        pay this, there won&apos;t be any left for next week. Do you think your
                        hotel man will open his hotel this month?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think so,&quot; returned Hurstwood. &quot;He said he
                        would.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a while, Hurstwood said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry about it. Maybe the grocer will wait. He can
                        do that. We&apos;ve traded there long enough to make him trust us for a
                        week or two.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think he will?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>On this account, Hurstwood, this very day, looked grocer Oeslogge clearly in
                        the eye as he ordered a pound of coffee, and said:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-441" n="435"/>
                    <p>&quot;Do you mind carrying my account until the end of every
                        week?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no, Mr. Wheeler,&quot; said Mr. Oeslogge. &quot;Dat iss
                        all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood, still tactful in distress, added nothing to this. It seemed an
                        easy thing. He looked out of the door, and then gathered up his coffee when
                        ready and came away. The game of a desperate man had begun.</p>
                    <p>Rent was paid, and now came the grocer. Hurst-wood managed by paying out of
                        his own ten and collecting from Carrie at the end of the week. Then he
                        delayed a day next time settling with the grocer, and so soon had his ten
                        back, with Oeslogge getting his pay on this Thursday or Friday for last
                        Saturday&apos;s bill.</p>
                    <p>This entanglement made Carrie anxious for a change of some sort. Hurstwood
                        did not seem to realise that she had a right to anything. He schemed to make
                        what she earned cover all expenses, but seemed not to trouble over adding
                        anything himself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He talks about worrying,&quot; thought Carrie. &quot;If he
                        worried enough he couldn&apos;t sit there and wait for me. He&apos;d
                        get something to do. No man could go seven months without finding something
                        if he tried.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The sight of him always around in his untidy clothes and gloomy appearance
                        drove Carrie to seek relief in other places. Twice a week there were
                        matines, and then Hurstwood ate a cold snack, which he prepared himself. Two
                        other days there were rehearsals beginning at ten in the morning and lasting
                        usually until one. Now, to this Carrie added a few visits to one or two
                        chorus girls, including the blue-eyed soldier of the golden helmet. She did
                        it because it was pleasant and a relief from dulness of the home over which
                        her husband brooded.</p>
                    <p>The blue-eyed soldier&apos;s name was OsborneLola <pb id="VAA2423-442"
                            n="436"/> Osborne. Her room was in Nineteenth Street near Fourth Avenue,
                        a block now given up wholly to office buildings. Here she had a comfortable
                        back room, looking over a collection of back yards in which grew a number of
                        shade trees pleasant to see.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t your home in New York?&quot; she one day.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; but I can&apos;t get along with my people. They always
                        want me to do what they want. Do you live here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;With your family?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie was ashamed to say that she was married. She had talked so much about
                        getting more salary and confessed to so much anxiety about her future, that
                        now, when the direct question of fact was waiting, she could not tell this
                        girl.</p>
                    <p>&quot;With some relatives,&quot; sheanswered.</p>
                    <p>Miss Osborne took it for granted that, like herself, Carrie&apos;s time
                        was her own. She invariably asked her to stay, proposing little outings and
                        other things of that sort until Carrie began neglecting her dinner hours.
                        Hurstwood noticed it, but felt in no position to quarrel with her. Several
                        times she came so late as scarcely to have an hour in which to patch up a
                        meal and start for the theatre.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you rehearse in the afternoons?&quot; Hurstwood once asked,
                        concealing almost completely the cynical protest and regret which prompted
                        it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No; I was looking around for another place,&quot; said
                        Carrie.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact she was, but only in such a way as furnished the least
                        straw of an excuse. Miss Osborne and she had gone to the office of the
                        manager who was to produce the new opera at the Broadway <pb
                            id="VAA2423-443" n="437"/> and returned straight to the
                        former&apos;s room, where they had been since three
                        o&apos;clock.</p>
                    <p>Carrie felt this question to be an infringement on her liberty. She did not
                        take into account how much liberty she was securing. Only the latest step,
                        the newest freedom, must not be questioned.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood, saw it all clearly enough. He was shrewd after his kind, and yet
                        there was enough decency in the man to stop him from making any effectual
                        protest. In his almost inexplicable apathy he was content to droop supinely
                        while Carrie drifted out of his life, just as he was willing supinely to see
                        opportunity pass betesting in a mild, irritating, and ineffectual way,
                        howevera way that simply widened the breach by slow degrees.</p>
                    <p>A further enlargement of this chasm between them came when the manager,
                        looking between the wings upon the brightly lighted stage where the chorus
                        was going through some of its glittering evolutions, said to the master of
                        the ballet:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who is that fourth girl there on the rightthe one coming round at
                        the end now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said the ballet-master, &quot;that&apos;s
                        Miss Madenda.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s good looking. Why don&apos;t you let her head
                        that line?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will,&quot; said the man.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just do that. She&apos;ll look better there than the woman
                        you&apos;ve got.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right. I will do that,&quot; said the master.</p>
                    <p>The next evening carrie was called out, much as if for an error.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You lead your company to-night,&quot; said the master.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said carrie.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-444" n="438"/>
                    <p>&quot;Put snap into it,&quot; he added. &quot;We must have
                        snap.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; replied Carrie.</p>
                    <p>Astonished at this change, she thought that the heretofore leader must be
                        ill; but when she saw her in the line, with a distinct expression of
                        something unfavourable in her eye, she began to think that perhaps it was
                        merit.</p>
                    <p>She had a chic way of tossing her head to one side, and holding her arms as
                        if for actionnot listlessly. In front of the line this showed up even more
                        effectually.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That girl knows how to carry herself,&quot; said the manager,
                        another evening. He began to think that he should like to talk with her. If
                        he hadn&apos;t made it a rule to have nothing to do with the members of
                        the chorus, he would have approached her most unbendingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Put that girl at the head of the white column,&quot; he
                        suggested to the man in charge of the ballet.</p>
                    <p>This white column consisted of some twenty girls, all in snow-white flannel
                        trimmed with silver and blue. Its leader was most stunningly arrayed in the
                        same colours, elaborated, however, with epaulets and a belt of silver, with
                        a short sword dangling at one side. Carrie was fitted for this costume, and
                        a few days later appeared, proud of her new laurels. She was especially
                        gratified to find that her salary was now eighteen instead of twelve.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood heard nothing about this.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not give him the rest of my money,&quot; said
                        Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do enough. I am going to get me something to wear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact, during this second month she had been buying for herself
                        as recklessly as she dared, regardless of the consequences. There were
                        impending more complications rent day, and more extension <pb
                            id="VAA2423-445" n="439"/> of the credit system in the neighbourhood.
                        Now, however, she proposed to do better by herself.</p>
                    <p>Her first move was to buy a shirt waist, and in studying these she found how
                        little her money would buyhow much, if she could only use all. She forgot
                        that if she were alone she would have to pay for a room and board, and
                        imagined that every cent of her eighteen could be spent for clothes and
                        things that she liked.</p>
                    <p>At last she picked upon something, which not only used up all her surplus
                        above twelve, but invaded that sum. She knew she was going too far, but her
                        feminine love of finery prevailed. The next day Hurstwood said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;We owe the grocer five dollars and forty cents this
                        week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do we?&quot; said Carrie, frowning a little.</p>
                    <p>She looked in her purse to leave it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve only got eight dollars and twenty cents
                        altogether.&quot;</p>
                    <p>We owe the milkman sixty cents,&quot; added Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and there&apos;s the coal man,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood said nothing. He had seen the new things she was buying; the way
                        she was neglecting household duties; the readiness with which she was
                        slipping out afternoons and staying. He felt that something was going to
                        happen. All at once she spoke:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she said; &quot;I
                        can&apos;t do it all. I don&apos;t earn enough.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was a direct challenge. Hurstwood had to take it up. He tried to be
                        calm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want you to do it all,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I only want a little help until I can get something to
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; answered Carrie. &quot;That&apos;s
                        always the <pb id="VAA2423-446" n="440"/> way. It takes more than I can earn
                        to pay for things. I don&apos;t see what I&apos;m going to
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ve tried to get something,&quot; he.
                        exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you want me to do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You couldn&apos;t have tried so very hard,&quot; said
                        Carrie. &quot;I got something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I did,&quot; he. said, angered almost to harsh words.
                        &quot;You needn&apos;t throw up your success to me. All I asked was
                        a little help until I could get something. I&apos;m not down yet.
                        I&apos;ll come up all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He tried to speak steadily, but his voice trembled a little.</p>
                    <p>Carrie&apos;s anger melted on the instant. She felt ashamed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;here&apos;s the
                        money,&quot; and emptied it out on the table. &quot;I
                        haven&apos;t got quit enough to pay it all. If they can wait until
                        Saturday, though, I&apos;ll have some more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You keep it,&quot; said Hurstwood, sadly. &quot;I only want
                        enough to pay the grocer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She put it back, and proceeded to get dinner early and in good time. Her
                        little bravado made her feel as if she ought to make amends.</p>
                    <p>In a little while their old thoughts returned to both.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s making more than she says,&quot; thought
                        Hurstwood. &quot;She says she&apos;s making twelve, but that
                        wouldn&apos;t buy all those things. I don&apos;t care. Let her keep
                        her money. I&apos;ll get something again one of these days. Then she can
                        go to the deuce.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He only said this in his anger, but it prefigured a possible course of action
                        and attitude well enough.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care,&quot; thought Carrie. &quot;He ought
                        to be told to get out and do something. It isn&apos;t right that I
                        should support him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In these days Carrie was introduced to several youths, <pb id="VAA2423-447"
                            n="441"/> friends of Miss Osborne, who were of the kind most aptly
                        described as gay and festive. They called once to get Miss Osborne for an
                        afternoon drive. Carrie was with her at the time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come and go along,&quot; said Lola.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I can&apos;t,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, come and go. What have you got to do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have to be home by five,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, dinner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ll take us to dinner,&quot; said Lola.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;I won&apos;t go. I
                        can&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, do come. They&apos;re awful nice boys. We&apos;ll get
                        you back in time. We&apos;re only going for a drive in Central
                        Park.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie thought a while, and at last yielded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, I must be back by half-past four,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>The information went in one ear of Lola and out the other.</p>
                    <p>After Drouet and Hurstwood, there was the least touch of cynicism in her
                        attitude toward young menespecially of the gay and frivolous sort. She felt
                        a little older than they. Some of their pretty compliments seemed silly.
                        Still, she was young in heart and body and youth appealed to her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, we&apos;ll be right back, Miss Madenda,&quot; said one
                        of the chaps, bowing. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t think we&apos;d
                        keep you over time, now, would you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Carrie, smiling.</p>
                    <p>They were off for a driveshe, looking about and noticing fine clothing, the
                        young men voicing those silly pleasantries and weak quips which pass for
                        humour in coy circles. Carrie saw the great park parade of carriages,
                        beginning at the Fifty-ninth Street entrance <pb id="VAA2423-448" n="442"/>
                        and winding past the Museum of Art to the exit at One Hundred and Tenth
                        Street and Seventh Avenue. Her eye was once more taken by the show of
                        wealththe elaborate costumes, elegant harnesses, spirited horses, and, above
                        all, the beauty. Once more the plague of poverty galled her, but now she
                        forgot in a measure her own troubles so far as to forget Hurstwood. He
                        waited until four, five, and even six. It was getting dark when he got up
                        out of his chair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess she isn&apos;t coming home,&quot; he said,
                        grimly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the way,&quot; he thought.
                        &quot;She&apos;s getting a start now. I&apos;m out of
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie had really discovered her neglect, but only at a quarter after five,
                        and the open carriage was now far up Seventh Avenue, near the Harlem
                        River.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What time is it?&quot; she inquired. &quot;I must be
                        getting back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A quarter after five,&quot; said her companion, consulting an
                        elegant, open-faced watch.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, dear me!&quot; exclaimed Carrie. Then she settled back with
                        a sigh. &quot;There&apos;s no use crying over spilt milk,&quot;
                        she said. &quot;It&apos;s too late.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course it is,&quot; said the youth, who saw visions of a
                        fine dinner now, and such invigorating talk as would result in a reunion
                        after the show. He was greatly taken with Carrie. &quot;We&apos;ll
                        drive down to Delmonico&apos;s now and have something there,
                        won&apos;t we, Orrin?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To be sure,&quot; replied Orrin, gaily.</p>
                    <p>Carrie thought of Hurstwood. Never before had she neglected dinner without an
                        excuse.</p>
                    <p>They drove back, and at 6.15 sat down to dine. It was the sherry incident
                        over again, the remembrance of which came painfully back to Carrie. She
                        remembered Mrs. Vance, who had never called again after
                        Hurst-wood&apos;s reception, and Ames.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-449" n="443"/>
                    <p>At this figure her mind halted. It was a strong, clean vision. He liked
                        better books than she read, better people than she associated with. His
                        ideals burned in her heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s fine to be a good actress,&quot; came distinctly
                        back.</p>
                    <p>What sort of an actress was she?</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you thinking about, Miss Madenda?&quot; inquired her
                        merry companion. &quot;come now, let&apos;s see if I can
                        guess.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;Don&apos;t
                        try.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook it off and ate. She forgot, in part, and was merry. When it came to
                        the after-theatre proposition, however, she shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;I can&apos;t. I have a
                        previous engagement.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, now, Miss Madenda,&quot; pleaded the youth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Carrie, &quot;I can&apos;t.
                        You&apos;ve been so kind, but you&apos;ll have to excuse
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The youth looked exceedingly crestfallen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cheer up, old man,&quot; whispered his companion.
                        &quot;We&apos;ll go around, anyhow. She may change her
                        mind.&quot;</p>

                    <p>There was no after-theatre lark, however, so far as Carrie was concerned. She
                        made her way homeward, thinking about her absence. Hurstwood was asleep, but
                        roused up to look as she passed through to her own bed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that you?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>The next morning at breakfast she felt like apologising.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t get home last evening,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, Carrie,&quot; he answered, &quot;what&apos;s the
                        use saying that? I don&apos;t care. You needn&apos;t tell me that,
                        though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t,&quot; said Carrie, her colour rising.
                        Then, seeing that he looked as if he said &quot;I know,&quot; she
                        exclaimed: &quot;Oh, all right. I don&apos;t care.&quot;</p>
                    <p>From now on, her indifference to the flat was even greater. There seemed no
                        common ground on which they could talk to one another. She let herself be
                        asked for expenses. It became so with him that he hated to do it. He
                        preferred standing off the butcher and baker. He ran up a grocery bill of
                        sixteen dollars with Oeslogge, laying in a supply of staple articles, so
                        that they would not have to buy any of those things for some time to come.
                        Then he changed his grocery. It was the same with the butcher and several
                        others. Carrie never heard anything of this directly from him. He asked for
                        such as he could expect, drifting farther and <pb id="VAA2423-451" n="445"/>
                        farther into a situation which could have but one ending.</p>
                    <p>In this fashion, September went by.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t Mr. Drake going to open his hotel?&quot; Carrie
                        asked several times.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. He won&apos;t do it before October, though,
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie became disgusted. &quot;Such a man,&quot; she said to herself
                        frequently. More and more she visited. She put most of her spare money in
                        clothes, which, after all, was not an astonishing amount. At last the opera
                        she was with announced its departure within four weeks. &quot;Last two
                        weeks of the Great Comic Opera successThe,&quot; etc., was upon all
                        billboards and in the newspapers, before she acted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not going out on the road,&quot; said Miss
                        Osborne.</p>
                    <p>Carrie went with her to apply to another manager.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ever had any experience?&quot; was one of his questions.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m with the company at the Casino now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you are?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>The end of this was another engagement at twenty per week.</p>
                    <p>Carrie was delighted. She began to feel that she had a place in the world.
                        People recognised ability.</p>
                    <p>So changed was her state that the home atmosphere became intolerable. It was
                        all poverty and trouble there, or seemed to be, because it was a load to
                        bear. It became a place to keep away from. Still she slept there, and did a
                        fair amount of work, keeping it in order. It was a sitting place for
                        Hurstwood. He sat and rocked, rocked and read, enveloped in the gloom of his
                        own fate. October went by, and November. It was the dead of winter almost
                        before he knew it, and there he sat.</p>
                    <p>Carrie was doing better, that he knew. Her clothes <pb id="VAA2423-452"
                            n="446"/> were improved now, even fine. He saw her coming and going,
                        sometimes picturing to himself her rise. Little eating had thinned him
                        somewhat. He had no appetite. His clothes, too, were a poor man&apos;s
                        clothes. Talk about getting something had become even too threadbare and
                        ridiculous for him. So he folded his hands and waitedfor what, he could not
                        anticipate.</p>
                    <p>At last, however, troubles became too thick. The hounding of creditors, the
                        indifference of Carrie, the silence of the flat, and presence of winter, all
                        joined to produce a climax. It was effected by the arrival of Oeslogge,
                        personally, when Carrie was there.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I call about my bill,&quot; said Mr. Oeslogge.</p>
                    <p>Carrie was only faintly surprised.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much is it?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sixteen dollars,&quot; he replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, that much?&quot; said Carrie. &quot;Is this
                        right?&quot; she asked, turning to Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I never heard anything about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked as if she thought he had been contracting some needless
                        expense.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we had it all right,&quot; he answered. Then he went to
                        the door. &quot;I can&apos;t pay you anything on that
                        to-day,&quot; he said, mildly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, when can you?&quot; said the grocer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not before Saturday, anyhow,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Huh!&quot; returned the grocer. &quot;This is fine. I must
                        have that. I need the money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie was standing farther back in the room, hearing it all. She was greatly
                        distressed. It was so bad and commonplace. Hurstwood was annoyed also.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;there&apos;s no use talking
                        about it now. If you&apos;ll come in Saturday, I&apos;ll pay you
                        something on it.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-453" n="447"/>
                    <p>The grocery man went away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How are we going to pay it?&quot; asked Carrie, astonished by
                        the bill. &quot;I can&apos;t do it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you don&apos;t have to,&quot; he said. &quot;He
                        can&apos;t get what he can&apos;t get. He&apos;ll have to
                        wait.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see how we ran up such a bill as that,&quot;
                        said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we ate it,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s funny,&quot; she replied, still doubting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the use of your standing there and talking like
                        that, now?&quot; he asked. &quot;Do you think I&apos;ve had it
                        alone? You talk as if I&apos;d taken something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it&apos;s too much, anyhow,&quot; said Carrie.
                        &quot;I oughtn&apos;t to be made to pay for it. I&apos;ve got
                        more than I can pay for now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; replied Hurstwood, sitting down in silence. He
                        was sick of the grind of this thing.</p>
                    <p>Carrie went out, and there he sat, determining to do something.</p>
                    <p>There had been appearing in the papers about this time rumours and notices of
                        an approaching strike on the trolley lines in Brooklyn. There was general
                        dissatisfaction as to the hours of labour required and the wages paid. As
                        usualand for some inexplicable reasonthe men chose the winter for the
                        forcing of the hand of their employers and the settlement of their
                        difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood had been reading of this thing, and wondering concerning the huge
                        tie-up which would follow. A day or two before this trouble with Carrie, it
                        came. On a cold afternoon, when everything was grey and it threatened to
                        snow, the papers announced that the men had been called out on all the
                        lines.</p>
                    <p>Being so utterly idle, and his mind filled with the numerous predictions
                        which had been made concerning <pb id="VAA2423-454" n="448"/> the scarcity
                        of labour this winter and the panicky state of the financial market,
                        Hurstwood read this with interest. He noted the claims of the striking
                        motormen and conductors, who said that they had been wont to receive two
                        dollars a day in times past, but that for a year or more
                        &quot;trippers&quot; had been introduced, which cut down their
                        chance of livelihood one-half, and increased their hours of servitude from
                        ten to twelve, and even fourteen. These &quot;trippers&quot; were
                        men put on during the busy and <hi rend="i">rush</hi> hours, to take a car
                        out for one trip. The compensation paid for such a trip was only twenty-five
                        cents. When the rush or busy hours were over, they were laid off. Worst of
                        all, no man might know when he was going to get a car. He must come to the
                        barns in the morning and wait around in fair and foul weather until such
                        time as he was needed. Two trips were an average reward for so much waitinga
                        little over three hours&apos; work for fifty cents. The work of waiting
                        was not counted.</p>
                    <p>The men complained that this system was extending, and that the time was not
                        far off when but a few out of 7,000 employees would have regular
                        two-dollar-a-day work at all. They demanded that the system be abolished,
                        and that ten hours be considered a day&apos;s work, barring unavoidable
                        delays, with $2.25 pay. They demanded immediate acceptance of these terms,
                        which the various trolley companies refused.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood at first sympathised with the demands of these menindeed, it is a
                        question whether he did not always sympathise with them to the end, belie
                        him as his actions might. Reading nearly all the news, he was attracted
                        first by the scare-heads with which the trouble was noted in the
                        &quot;World.&quot; He read it fully the names of the seven companies
                        involved, the number of men.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-455" n="449"/>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re foolish to strike in this sort of
                        weather,&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;Let&apos;em win if
                        they can, though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The next day there was even a larger notice of it. &quot;Brooklynites
                        Walk,&quot; said the &quot;World.&quot; &quot;Knights of
                        Labour Tie up the Trolley Lines Across the Bridge.&quot; &quot;About
                        Seven Thousand Men Out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood read this, formulating to himself his own idea of what would be the
                        outcome. He was a great believer in the strength of corporations.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They can&apos;t win,&quot; he said, concerning the men.
                        &quot;They haven&apos;t any money. The police will protect the
                        companies. They&apos;ve got to. The public has to have its
                        cars.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He didn&apos;t sympathise with the corporations, but strength was with
                        them. So was property and public utility.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Those fellows can&apos;t win,&quot; he thought.</p>
                    <p>Among other things, he noticed a circular issued by one of the companies,
                        which read:</p>

                    <p>He also noted among the want ads. one which read:</p>
                    <p>&quot;WANTED.50 skilled motormen, accustomed to Westing-house system, to
                        run U. S. mail cars only, in the City of Brooklyn; protection
                        guaranteed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He noted particularly in each the &quot;protection guaranteed.&quot;
                        It signified to him the unassailable power of the companies.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ve got the militia on their side,&quot; he
                        thought.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There isn&apos;t anything those men can do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>While this was still in his mind, the incident with Oeslogge and Carrie
                        occurred. There had been a good deal to irritate him, but this seemed much
                        the worst. Never before had she accused him of stealingor very near that.
                        She doubted the naturalness of so large a bill. And he had worked so hard to
                        make expenses seem light. He had been &quot;doing&quot; butcher and
                        baker in order not to call on her. He had eaten very littlealmost
                        nothing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Damn it all!&quot; he said. &quot;I can get something.
                        I&apos;m not down yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He thought that he really must do something now. It was too cheap to sit
                        around after such an insinuation as this. Why, after a little, he would be
                        standing anything.</p>
                    <p>He got up and looked out the window into the chilly street. It came gradually
                        into his mind, as he stood there, to go to Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot; his mind said. &quot;Any one can get work
                        over there. You&apos;ll get two a day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How about accidents?&quot; said a voice. &quot;You might
                        get hurt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, there won&apos;t be much of that,&quot; he answered.
                        &quot;They&apos;ve called out the police. Any one who wants to run a
                        car will be protected all right.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-457" n="451"/>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t know how to run a car,&quot; rejoined the
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t apply as a motorman,&quot; he answered.
                        &quot;I can ring up fares all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ll want motormen mostly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ll take anybody; that I know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>For several hours he argued pro and con with this mental counsellor, feeling
                        no need to act at once in a matter so sure of profit.</p>
                    <p>In the morning he put on his best clothes, which were poor enough, and began
                        stirring about, putting some bread and meat into a page of a newspaper.
                        Carrie watched him, interested in this new move.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Over to Brooklyn,&quot; he answered. Then, seeing her still
                        inquisitive, he added: &quot;I think I can get on over
                        there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;On the trolley lines?&quot; said Carrie, astonished.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he rejoined.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aren&apos;t you afraid?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What of?&quot; he answered. &quot;The police are protecting
                        them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The paper said four men were hurt yesterday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he returned; &quot;but you can&apos;t go by
                        what the papers say. They&apos;ll run the cars all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked rather determined now, in a desolate sort of way, and Carrie felt
                        very sorry. Something of the old Hurstwood was herethe least shadow of what
                        was once shrewd and pleasant strength. Outside, it was cloudy and blowing a
                        few flakes of snow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a day to go over there,&quot; thought Carrie.</p>
                    <p>Now he left before she did, which was a remarkable thing, and tramped
                        eastward to Fourteenth Street and Sixth Avenue, where he took the car. He
                        had read that scores of applicants were applying at the office of <pb
                            id="VAA2423-458" n="452"/> the Brooklyn City Railroad building and were
                        being received. He made his way there by horse-car and ferrya dark, silent
                        manto the offices in question. It was a long way, for no cars were running,
                        and the day was cold; but he trudged along grimly. Once in Brooklyn, he
                        could clearly see and feel that a strike was on. People showed it in their
                        manner. Along the routes of certain tracks not a car was running. About
                        certain corners and nearby saloons small groups of men were lounging.
                        Several spring wagons passed him, equipped with plain wooden chairs, and
                        labeled &quot;Flatbush &quot;or &quot;Prospect Park. Fare, Ten
                        Cents.&quot; He noticed cold and even gloomy faces. Labour was having
                        its little war.</p>
                    <p>When he came near the office in question, he saw a few men standing about,
                        and some policemen. On the far corners were other menwhom he took to be
                        strikerswatching. All the houses were small and wooden, the streets poorly
                        paved. After New York, Brooklyn looked actually poor and hard-up.</p>
                    <p>He made his way into the heart of the small group, eyed by policemen and the
                        men already there. One of the officers addressed him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you looking for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to see if I can get a place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The offices are up those steps,&quot; said the bluecoat. His
                        face was a very neutral thing to contemplate. In his heart of hearts, he
                        sympathised with the strikers and hated this &quot;scab.&quot; In
                        his heart of hearts, also, he felt the dignity and use of the police force,
                        which commanded order. Of its true social significance, he never once
                        dreamed. His was not the mind for that. The two feelings blended in
                        himneutralised one another and him. He would have fought for this man as
                        determinedly as for himself, and yet only so far as <pb id="VAA2423-459"
                            n="453"/> commanded. Strip him of his uniform, and he would have soon
                        picked his side.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood ascended a dusty flight of steps and entered a small, dust-coloured
                        office, in which were a railing, a long desk, and several clerks.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, sir?&quot; said a middle-aged man, looking up at him from
                        the long desk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you want to hire any men? &quot;inquired Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are youa motorman?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No; I&apos;m not anything,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>He was not at all abashed by his position. He knew these people needed men.
                        If one didn&apos;t take him, another would. This man could take him or
                        leave him, just as he chose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we prefer experienced men, of course,&quot; said the man.
                        He paused, while Hurstwood smiled indifferently. Then he added:
                        &quot;Still, I guess you can learn. What is your name?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wheeler,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>The man wrote an order on a small card. &quot;Take that to our
                        barns,&quot; hesaid, &quot;and give it to the foreman.
                        He&apos;ll show you what to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood went down and out. He walked straight away in the direction
                        indicated, while the policemen looked after.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s another wants to try it,&quot; said Officer
                        Kiely to Officer Macey.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have my mind he&apos;ll get his fill,&quot; returned the
                        latter, quietly.</p>
                    <p>They had been in strikes before.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE STRIKE</head>
                    <p>The barn at which Hurstwood applied was exceedingly short-handed, and was
                        being operated practically by three men as directors. There were a lot of
                        green hands aroundqueer, hungry-looking men, who looked as if want had
                        driven them to desperate means. They tried to be lively and willing, but
                        there was an air of hang-dog diffidence about the place.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood went back through the barns and out into a large, enclosed lot,
                        where were a series of tracks and loops. A half-dozen cars were there,
                        manned by instructors, each with a pupil at the lever. More pupils were
                        waiting at one of the rear doors of the barn.</p>
                    <p>In silence Hurstwood viewed this scene, and waited. His companions took his
                        eye for a while, though they did not interest him much more than the cars.
                        They were an uncomfortable-looking gang, however. One or two were very thin
                        and lean. Several were quite stout. Several others were rawboned and sallow,
                        as if they had been beaten upon by all sorts of rough weather.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you see by the paper they are going to call out the militia?
                        &quot;Hurstwood heard one of them remark.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, they&apos;ll do that,&quot; returned the other.
                        &quot;They always do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Think we&apos;re liable to have much trouble?&quot; said
                        another, whom Hurstwood did not see.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-461" n="455"/>
                    <p>&quot;Not very.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That Scotchman that went out on the last car,&quot; put in a
                        voice, &quot;told me that they hit him in the ear with a
                        cinder.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A small, nervous laugh accompanied this.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One of those fellows on the Fifth Avenue line must have had a hell
                        of a time, according to the papers,&quot; drawled another.
                        &quot;They broke his car windows and pulled him off into the street
                        &apos;fore the police could stop &apos;em.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; but there are more police around to-day,&quot; was added
                        by another.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood hearkened without much mental comment. These talkers seemed scared
                        to him. Their gabbling was feverishthings said to quiet their own minds. He
                        looked out into the yard and waited.</p>
                    <p>Two of the men got around quite near him, but behind his back. They were
                        rather social, and he listened to what they said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you a railroad man?&quot; said one.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Me? No. I&apos;ve always worked in a paper
                        factory.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I had a job in Newark until last October,&quot; returned the
                        other, with reciprocal feeling.</p>
                    <p>There were some words which passed too low to hear. Then the conversation
                        became strong again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t blame these fellers for striking,&quot; said
                        one.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ve got the right of it, all right, but I had to get
                        something to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Same here,&quot; said the other. &quot;If I had any job in
                        Newark I wouldn&apos;t be over here takin&apos; chances like
                        these.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s hell these days, ain&apos;t it?&quot; said
                        the man. &quot;A poor man ain&apos;t nowhere. You could starve, by
                        God, right in the streets, and there ain&apos;t most no one would help
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-462" n="456"/>
                    <p>&quot;Right you are,&quot; said the other. &quot;The job I had I
                        lost &apos;cause they shut down. They run all summer and lay up a big
                        stock, and then shut down.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood paid some little attention to this. Somehow, he felt a little
                        superior to these twoa little better off. To him these were ignorant and
                        commonplace, poor sheep in a driver&apos;s hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Poor devils,&quot; he thought, speaking out of the thoughts and
                        feelings of a bygone period of success.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Next,&quot; said one of the instructors.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re next,&quot; said a neighbour, touching him.</p>
                    <p>He went out and climbed on the platform. The instructor took it for granted
                        that no preliminaries were needed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You see this handle,&quot; he said, reaching up to an electric
                        cut-off, which was fastened to the roof. &quot;This throws the current
                        off or on. If you want to reverse the car you turn it over here. If you want
                        to send it forward, you put it over here. If you want to cut off the power,
                        you keep it in the middle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood smiled at the simple information.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, this handle here regulates your speed. To here,&quot; he
                        said, pointing with his finger, &quot;gives you about four miles an
                        hour. This is eight. When it&apos;s full on, you make about fourteen
                        miles an hour.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood watched him calmly. He had seen motormen work before. He knew just
                        about how they did it, and was sure he could do as well, with a very little
                        practice.</p>
                    <p>The instructor explained a few more details, and then said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, we&apos;ll back her up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood stood placidly by, while the car rolled back into the yard.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One thing you want to be careful about, and that is <pb
                            id="VAA2423-463" n="457"/> to start easy. Give one degree time to act
                        before you start another. The one fault of most men is that they always want
                        to throw her wide open. That&apos;s bad. It&apos;s dangerous, too.
                        Wears out the motor. You don&apos;t want to do that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>He waited and waited, while the man talked on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now you take it,&quot; he said, finally.</p>
                    <p>The ex-manager laid hand to the lever and pushed it gently, as he thought. It
                        worked much easier than he imagined, however, with the result that the car
                        jerked quickly forward, throwing him back against the door. He straightened
                        up sheepishly, while the instructor stopped the car with the brake.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You want to be careful about that,&quot; was all he said.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood found, however, that handling a brake and regulating speed were not
                        so instantly mastered as he had imagined. Once or twice he would have
                        ploughed through the rear fence if it had not been for the hand and word of
                        his companion. The latter was rather patient with him, but he never
                        smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve got to get the knack of working both arms at
                        once,&quot; he said. &quot;It takes a little practice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>One o&apos;clock came while he was still on the car practising, and he
                        began to feel hungry. The day set in snowing, and he was cold. He grew weary
                        of running to and fro on the short track.</p>
                    <p>They ran the car to the end and both got off. Hurst-wood went into the barn
                        and sought a car step, pulling out his paper-wrapped lunch from his pocket.
                        There was no water and the bread was dry, but he enjoyed it. There was no
                        ceremony about dining. He swallowed and looked about, contemplating the
                        dull, homely labour of the thing. It was disagreeablemiserably <pb
                            id="VAA2423-464" n="458"/> disagreeablein all its phases. Not because it
                        was bitter, but because it was hard. It would be hard to any one, he
                        thought.</p>
                    <p>After eating, he stood about as before, waiting until his turn came.</p>
                    <p>The intention was to give him an afternoon of practice, but the greater part
                        of the time was spent in waiting about.</p>
                    <p>At last evening came, and with it hunger and a debate with himself as to how
                        he should spend the night. It was half-past five. He must soon eat. If he
                        tried to go home, it would take him two hours and a half of cold walking and
                        riding. Besides, he had orders to report at seven the next morning, and
                        going home would necessitate his rising at an unholy and disagreeable hour.
                        He had only something like a dollar and fifteen cents of Carrie&apos;s
                        money, with which he had intended to pay the two weeks&apos; coal bill
                        before the present idea struck him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They must have some place around here,&quot; he
                        thought.&quot; Where does that fellow from Newark stay?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Finally he decided to ask. There was a young fellow standing near one of the
                        doors in the cold, waiting a last turn. He was a mere boy in yearstwenty-one
                        aboutbut with a body lank and long, because of privation. A little good
                        living would have made this youth plump and swaggering.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do they arrange this, if a man hasn&apos;t any
                        money?&quot; inquired Hurstwood, discreetly.</p>
                    <p>The fellow turned a keen, watchful face on the inquirer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean eat?&quot; he replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and sleep. I can&apos;&apos;t go back to New York
                        to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-465" n="459"/>
                    <p>&quot;The foreman &apos;ll fix that if you ask him, I guess. He did
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. I just told him I didn&apos;t have anything. Gee, I
                        couldn&apos;t go home. I live way over in Hoboken.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood only cleared his throat by way of acknowledgment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ve got a place upstairs here, I understand. I
                        don&apos;t know what sort of a thing it is. Purty tough, I guess. He
                        gave me a meal ticket this noon. I know that wasn&apos;t
                        much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood smiled grimly, and the boy laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It ain&apos;t no fun, is it?&quot; he inquired, wishing
                        vainly for a cheery reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not much,&quot; answered Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d tackle him now,&quot; volunteered the youth.
                        &quot;He may go &apos;way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood did so.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t there some place I can stay around here
                        tonight?&quot; he inquired. &quot;If I have to go back to New York,
                        I&apos;m afraid I won&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;re some cots upstairs,&quot; interrupted the
                        man, &quot;if you want one of them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;ll do,&quot; he assented.</p>
                    <p>He meant to ask for a meal ticket, but the seemingly proper moment never
                        came, and he decided to pay himself that night.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll ask him in the morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He ate in a cheap restaurant in the vicinity, and, being cold and lonely,
                        went straight off to seek the loft in question. The company was not
                        attempting to run cars after nightfall. It was so advised by the police.</p>
                    <p>The room seemed to have been a lounging place for night workers. There were
                        some nine cots in the place, two or three wooden chairs, a soap box, and a
                        small, <pb id="VAA2423-466" n="460"/> round-bellied stove, in which a fire
                        was blazing. Early as he was, another man was there before him. The latter
                        was sitting beside the stove warming his hands.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood approached and held out his own toward the fire. He was sick of the
                        bareness and privation of all things connected with his venture, but was
                        steeling himself to hold out. He fancied he could for a while.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cold, isn&apos;t it? &quot; said the early guest.</p>
                    <p>&quot; Rather.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A long silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not much of a place to sleep in, is it?&quot; said the man.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better than nothing,&quot; replied Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>Another silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I believe I&apos;ll turn in,&quot; said the man.</p>
                    <p>Rising, he went to one of the cots and stretched himself, removing only his
                        shoes, and pulling the one blanket and dirty old comforter over him in a
                        sort of bundle. The sight disgusted Hurstwood, but he did not dwell on it,
                        choosing to gaze into the stove and think of some-thing else. Presently he
                        decided to retire, and picked a cot, also removing his shoes.</p>
                    <p>While he was doing so, the youth who had advised him to come here entered,
                        and, seeing Hurstwood, tried to be genial.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better&apos;n nothin&apos;,&quot; he observed, looking
                        around.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood did not take this to himself. He thought it to be an expression of
                        individual satisfaction, and so did not answer. The youth imagined he was
                        out of sorts, and set to whistling softly. Seeing another man asleep, he
                        quit that and lapsed into silence.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood made the best of a bad lot by keeping on his clothes and pushing
                        away the dirty covering from his head, but at last he dozed in sheer
                        weariness. The covering became more and more comfortable, its character <pb
                            id="VAA2423-467" n="461"/> was forgotten, and he pulled it about his
                        neck and slept.</p>
                    <p>In the morning he was aroused out of a pleasant dream by several men stirring
                        about in the cold, cheerless room. He had been back in Chicago in fancy, in
                        his own comfortable home. Jessica had been arranging to go somewhere, and he
                        had been talking with her about it. This was so clear in his mind, that he
                        was startled now by the contrast of this room. He raised his head, and the
                        cold, bitter reality jarred him into wakefulness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Guess I&apos;d better get up,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>There was no water on this floor. He put on his shoes in the cold and stood
                        up, shaking himself in his stiffness.</p>
                    <p>His clothes felt disagreeable, his hair bad.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hell!&quot; he muttered, as he put on his hat.</p>
                    <p>Downstairs things were stirring again.</p>
                    <p>He found a hydrant, with a trough which had once been used for horses, but
                        there was no towel here, and his handkerchief was soiled from yesterday. He
                        contented himself with wetting his eyes with the ice-cold water. Then he
                        sought the foreman, who was already on the ground.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Had your breakfast yet?&quot; inquired that worthy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better get it, then; your car won&apos;t be ready for a little
                        while.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood hesitated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Could you let me have a meal ticket?&quot; he asked, with an
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here you are,&quot; said the man, handing him one.</p>
                    <p>He breakfasted as poorly as the night before on some fried steak and bad
                        coffee. Then he went back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here,&quot; said the foreman, motioning him, when he came in.
                        &quot;You take this car out in a few minutes.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-468" n="462"/>
                    <p>Hurstwood climbed up on the platform in the gloomy barn and waited for a
                        signal. He was nervous, and yet the thing was a relief. Anything was better
                        than the barn.</p>
                    <p>On this the fourth day of the strike, the situation had taken a turn for the
                        worse. The strikers, following the counsel of their leaders and the
                        newspapers, had struggled peaceably enough. There had been no great violence
                        done. Cars had been stopped, it is true, and the men argued with. Some crews
                        had been won over and led away, some windows broken, some jeering and
                        yelling done: but in no more than five or six instances had men been
                        seriously injured. These by crowds whose acts the leaders disclaimed.</p>
                    <p>Idleness, however, and the sight of the company, backed by the police,
                        triumphing, angered the men. They saw that each day more cars were going on,
                        each day more declarations were being made by the company officials that the
                        effective opposition of the strikers was broken. This put desperate thoughts
                        in the minds of the men. Peaceful methods meant, they saw, that the
                        companies would soon run all their cars and those who had complained would
                        be forgotten. There was nothing so helpful to the companies as peaceful
                        methods.</p>
                    <p>All at once they blazed forth, and for a week there was storm and stress.
                        Cars were assailed, men attacked, policemen struggled with, tracks torn up,
                        and shots fired, until at last street fights and mob movements became
                        frequent, and the city was invested with militia.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood knew nothing of the change of temper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Run your car out,&quot; called the foreman, waving a vigorous
                        hand at him. A green conductor jumped up behind and rang the bell twice as a
                        signal to start.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-469" n="463"/>
                    <p>Hurstwood turned the lever and ran the car out through the door into the
                        street in front of the barn. Here two brawny policemen got up beside him on
                        the platformone on either hand.</p>
                    <p>At the sound of a gong near the barn door, two bells were given by the
                        conductor and Hurstwood opened his lever.</p>
                    <p>The two policemen looked about them calmly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Tis cold, all right, this morning,&quot; said the one
                        on the left, who possessed a rich brogue.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I had enough of it yesterday,&quot; said the other. &quot;I
                        wouldn&apos;t want a steady job of this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nor I.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Neither paid the slightest attention to Hurstwood, who stood facing the cold
                        wind, which was chilling him completely, and thinking of his orders.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Keep a steady gait,&quot; the foreman had said.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t stop for any one who doesn&apos;t look like a
                        real passenger. Whatever you do, don&apos;t stop for a
                        crowd.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The two officers kept silent for a few moments.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The last man must have gone through all right,&quot; said the
                        officer on the left. &quot;I don&apos;t see his car
                        anywhere.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s on there?&quot; asked the second officer,
                        referring, of course, to its complement of policemen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Schaeffer and Ryan.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was another silence, in which the car ran smoothly along. There were
                        not so many houses along this part of the way. Hurstwood did not see many
                        people either. The situation was not wholly disagreeable to him. If he were
                        not so cold, he thought he would do well enough.</p>
                    <p>He was brought out of this feeling by the sudden appearance of a curve ahead,
                        which he hadnot expected. He shut off the current and did an energetic turn
                        at the <pb id="VAA2423-470" n="464"/> brake, but not in time to avoid an
                        unnaturally quick turn. It shook him up and made him feel like making some
                        apologetic remarks, but he refrained.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You want to look out for them things,&quot; said the officer on
                        the left, condescendingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; agreed Hurstwood,
                        shamefacedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s lots of them on this line,&quot; said the
                        officer on the right.</p>
                    <p>Around the corner a more populated way appeared. One or two pedestrians were
                        in view ahead. A boy coning out of a gate with a tin milk bucket gave
                        Hurstwood his first objectionable greeting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Scab! &quot; he yelled. &quot;Scab!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood heard it, but tried to make no comment, even to himself. He knew he
                        would get that, and much more of the same sort, probably.</p>
                    <p>At a corner farther up a man stood by the track and signalled the car to
                        stop.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind him,&quot; said one of the officers.
                        &quot;He&apos;s up to some game.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood obeyed. At the corner he saw the wisdom of it. No sooner did the
                        man perceive the intention to ignore him, than he shook his fist.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, you bloody coward!&quot; he yelled.</p>
                    <p>Some half dozen men, standing on the corner, flung taunts and jeers after the
                        speeding car.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood winced the least bit. The real thing was slightly worse than the
                        thoughts of it had been.</p>
                    <p>Now came in sight, three or four blocks farther on, a heap of something on
                        the track.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ve been at work, here, all right,&quot; said one
                        of the policemen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll have an argument, maybe,&quot; said the
                        other.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood ran the car close and stopped. He had not done so wholly, however,
                        before a crowd gathered <pb id="VAA2423-471" n="465"/> about. It was
                        composed of ex-motormen and conductors in part, with a sprinkling of friends
                        and sympathisers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come off the car, pardner,&quot; said one of the men in a voice
                        meant to be conciliatory. &quot;You don&apos;t want to take the
                        bread out of another man&apos;s mouth, do you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood held to his brake and lever, pale and very uncertain what to
                        do.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stand back,&quot; yelled one of the officers, leaning over the
                        platform railing. &quot;Clear out of this, now. Give the man a chance to
                        do his work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Listen, pardner,&quot; said the leader, ignoring the policeman
                        and addressing Hurstwood. &quot;We&apos;re all working men, like
                        yourself. If you were a regular motorman, and had been treated as
                        we&apos;ve been, you wouldn&apos;t want any one to come in and take
                        your place, would you? You wouldn&apos;t want any one to do you out of
                        your chance to get your rights, would you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shut her off! shut her off!&quot; urged the other of the
                        policemen, roughly. &quot;Get out of this, now,&quot; and he jumped
                        the railing and landed before the crowd and began shoving. Instantly the
                        other officer was down beside him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stand back, now,&quot; they yelled. &quot; Get out of this.
                        What the hell do you mean? Out, now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was like a small swarm of bees.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t shove me,&quot; said one of the strikers,
                        determinedly. &quot;I&apos;m not doing anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Get out of this!&quot; cried the officer, swinging his club.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll give ye a bat on the sconce. Back,
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What the hell!&quot; cried another of the strikers, pushing the
                        other way, adding at the saute time some lusty oaths.</p>
                    <p>Crack came an officer&apos;s club on his forehead. He blinked his eyes
                        blindly a few times, wabbled on his <pb id="VAA2423-472" n="466"/> legs,
                        threw up his hands, and staggered back. In return, a swift fist landed on
                        the officer&apos;s neck.</p>
                    <p>Infuriated by this, the latter plunged left and right, laying about madly
                        with his club. He was ably assisted by his brother of the blue, who poured
                        ponderous oaths upon the troubled waters. No severe damage was done, owing
                        to the agility of the strikers in keeping out of reach. They stood about the
                        sidewalk now and jeered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is the conductor?&quot; yelled one of the officers,
                        getting his eye on that individual, who had come nervously forward to stand
                        by Hurstwood. The latter had stood gazing upon the scene with more
                        astonishment than fear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you come down here and get these stones off the
                        track?&quot; inquired the officer. &quot;What you standing there
                        for? Do you want to stay here all day? Get down.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood breathed heavily in excitement and jumped down with the nervous
                        conductor as if he had been called.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hurry up, now,&quot; said the other policeman.</p>
                    <p>Cold as it was, these officers were hot and mad. Hurstwood worked with the
                        conductor, lifting stone after stone and warming himself by the work.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, you scab, you!&quot; yelled the crowd. &quot;You
                        coward! Steal a man&apos;s job, will you? Rob the poor, will you, you
                        thief? We&apos;ll get you yet, now. Wait.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Not all of this was delivered by one man. It came from here and there,
                        incorporated with much more of the same sort and curses.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Work, you blackguards,&quot; yelled a voice. &quot;Do the
                        dirty work. You&apos;re the suckers that keep the poor people
                        down!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;May God starve ye yet,&quot; yelled an old Irish woman, <pb
                            id="VAA2423-473" n="467"/> who now threw open a nearby window and stuck
                        out her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and you,&quot; she added, catching the eye of one of the
                        policemen. &quot;You bloody, murtherin&apos; thafe! Crack my son
                        over the head, will you, you hard-hearted, murtherin&apos; divil? Ah,
                        ye&quot;</p>
                    <p>But the officer turned a deaf ear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go to the devil, you old hag,&quot; he half muttered as he
                        stared round upon the scattered company.</p>
                    <p>Now the stones were off, and Hurstwood took his place again amid a continued
                        chorus of epithets. Both officers got up beside him and the conductor rang
                        the bell, when, bang! bang! through window and door came rocks and stones.
                        One narrowly grazed Hurst-wood&apos;s head. Another shattered the window
                        behind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Throw open your lever,&quot; yelled one of the officers,
                        grabbing at the handle himself.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood complied and the car shot away, followed by a rattle of stones and,
                        a rain of curses.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That hit me in the neck,&quot; said one of the officers.
                        &quot;I gave him a good crack for it, though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I must have left spots on some of them,&quot; said the
                        other.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know that big guy that called us a ,&quot; said the first.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll get him yet for that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought we were in for it sure, once there,&quot; said the
                        second.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood, warmed and excited, gazed steadily ahead. It was an astonishing
                        experience for him. He had read of these things, but the reality seemed
                        some-thing altogether new. He was no coward in spirit. The fact that he had
                        suffered this much now rather operated to arouse a stolid determination to
                        stick it out. He did not recur in thought to New York or the flat. This one
                        trip seemed a consuming thing.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-474" n="468"/>
                    <p>They now ran into the business heart of Brooklyn uninterrupted. People gazed
                        at the broken windows of the car and at Hurstwood in his plain clothes.
                        Voices called &quot;scab&quot; now and then, as well as other
                        epithets, but no crowd attacked the car. At the down-town end of the line,
                        one of the officers went to call up his station and report the trouble.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s a gang out there,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;laying for us yet. Better send some one over there and clean them
                        out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The car ran back more quietlyhooted, watched, flung at, but not attacked.
                        Hurstwood breathed freely when he saw the barns.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he observed to himself, &quot;I came out of
                        that all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The car was turned in and he was allowed to loaf a while, but later he was
                        again called. This time a new team of officers was aboard. Slightly more
                        confident, he sped the car along the commonplace streets and felt somewhat
                        less fearful. On one side, however, he suffered intensely. The day was raw,
                        with a sprinkling of snow and a gusty wind, made all the more intolerable by
                        the speed of the car. His clothing was not intended for this sort of work.
                        He shivered, stamped his feet, and beat his arms as he had seen other
                        motormen do in the past, but said nothing. The novelty and danger of the
                        situation modified in a way his disgust and distress at being compelled to
                        be here, but not enough to prevent him from feeling grim and sour. This was
                        a dog&apos;s life, he thought. It was a tough thing to have to come
                        to.</p>
                    <p>The one thought that strengthened him was the insult offered by Carrie. He
                        was not down so low as to take all that, he thought. He could do
                        somethingthis, evenfor a while. It would get better. He would save a
                        little.</p>
                    <p>A boy threw a clod of mud while he was thus reflecting <pb id="VAA2423-475"
                            n="469"/> and hit him upon the arm. It hurt sharply and angered him more
                        than he had been any time since morning.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The little cur!&quot; he muttered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hurt you?&quot; asked one of the policemen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he answered.</p>
                    <p>At one of the corners, where the car slowed up because of a turn, an
                        ex-motorman, standing on the sidewalk, called to him:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you come out, pardner, and be a man? Remember
                        we&apos;re fighting for decent day&apos;s wages, that&apos;s
                        all. We&apos;ve got families to support.&quot; The man seemed most
                        peaceably inclined.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood pretended not to see him. He kept his eyes straight on before and
                        opened the lever wide. The voice had something appealing in it.</p>
                    <p>All morning this went on and long into the afternoon. He made three such
                        trips. The dinner he had was no stay for such work and the cold was telling
                        on him. At each end of the line he stopped to thaw out, but he could have
                        groaned at the anguish of it. One of the barnmen, out of pity, loaned him a
                        heavy cap and a pair of sheepskin gloves, and for once he was extremely
                        thankful.</p>
                    <p>On the second trip of the afternoon he ran into a crowd about half way along
                        the line, that had blocked the car&apos;s progress with an old telegraph
                        pole.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Get that thing off the track,&quot; shouted the two
                        policemen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yah, yah, yah!&quot; yelled the crowd. &quot;Get it off
                        yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The two policemen got down and Hurstwood started to follow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You stay there,&quot; one called. &quot;Some one will run
                        away with your car.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-476" n="470"/>
                    <p>Amid the babel of voices, Hurstwood heard one close beside him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come down, pardner, and be a man. Don&apos;t fight the poor.
                        Leave that to the corporations.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He saw the same fellow who had called to him from the corner. Now, as before,
                        he pretended not to hear him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come down,&quot; the man repeated gently. &quot;You
                        don&apos;t want to fight poor men. Don&apos;t fight at
                        all.&quot; It was a most philosophic and jesuitical motorman.</p>
                    <p>A third policeman joined the other two from some-where and some one ran to
                        telephone for more officers. Hurstwood gazed about, determined but
                        fearful.</p>
                    <p>A man grabbed him by the coat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come off of that,&quot; he exclaimed, jerking at him and trying
                        to pull him over the railing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let go,&quot; said Hurstwood, savagely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll show youyou scab!&quot; cried a young Irishman,
                        jumping up on the car and aiming a blow at Hurst-wood. The latter ducked and
                        caught it on the shoulder instead of the jaw.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Away from here,&quot; shouted an officer, hastening to the
                        rescue, and adding, of course, the usual oaths.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood recovered himself, pale and trembling. It was becoming serious with
                        him now. People were looking up and jeering at him. One girl was making
                        faces.</p>
                    <p>He began to waver in his resolution, when a patrol wagon rolled up and more
                        officers dismounted. Now the track was quickly cleared and the release
                        effected.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let her go now, quick,&quot; said the officer, and again he was
                        off.</p>
                    <p>The end came with a real mob, which met the car on its return trip a mile or
                        two from the barns. It was an exceedingly poor-looking neighbourhood. He <pb
                            id="VAA2423-477" n="471"/> wanted to run fast through it, but again the
                        track was blocked. He saw men carrying something out to it when he was yet a
                        half-dozen blocks away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There they are again!&quot; exclaimed one policeman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll give them something this time,&quot; said the
                        second officer, whose patience was becoming worn. Hurstwood suffered a qualm
                        of body as the car rolled up. As before, the crowd began hooting, but now,
                        rather than come near, they threw things. One or two windows were smashed
                        and Hurstwood dodged a stone.</p>
                    <p>Both policemen ran out toward the crowd, but the latter replied by running
                        toward the car. A womana mere girl in appearancewas among these, bearing a
                        rough stick. She was exceedingly wrathful and struck at Hurstwood, who
                        dodged. Thereupon, her companions, duly encouraged, jumped on the car and
                        pulled Hurstwood over. He had hardly time to speak or shout before he
                        fell.</p>
                    <p>Let go of me,&quot; he said, falling on his side.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, you sucker,&quot; he heard some one say. Kicks and blows
                        rained on him. He seethed to be suffocating. Then two men seemed to be
                        dragging him off and he wrestled for freedom.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let up,&quot; said a voice, &quot;you&apos;re all
                        right. Stand up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was let loose and recovered himself. Now he recognised two officers. He
                        felt as if he would faint from exhaustion. Something was wet on his chin. He
                        put up his hand and felt, then looked. It was red.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They cut me,&quot; he said, foolishly, fishing for his
                        handkerchief.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, now,&quot; said one of the officers.
                        &quot;It&apos;s only a scratch.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His senses became cleared nowaud he looked around. He was standing in a
                        little store, where they left him for the moment. Outside, he could see, as
                        he stood <pb id="VAA2423-478" n="472"/> wiping his chin, the car and the
                        excited crowd. A patrol wagon was there, and another.</p>
                    <p>He walked over and looked out. It was an ambulance, backing in.</p>
                    <p>He saw some energetic charging by the police and arrests being made.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on, now, if you want to take your car,&quot; said an
                        officer, opening the door and looking in.</p>
                    <p>He walked out, feeling rather uncertain of himself. He was very cold and
                        frightened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where&apos;s the conductor?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he&apos;s not here now,&quot; said the policeman.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood went toward the car and stepped nervously on. As he did so there
                        was a pistol shot. Something stung his shoulder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who fired that?&quot; he heard an officer exclaim. &quot;By
                        God! who did that?&quot; Both left him, running toward a certain
                        building. He paused a moment and then got down.</p>
                    <p>&quot;George!&quot; exclaimed Hurstwood, weakly, &quot;this is
                        too much for me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He walked nervously to the corner and hurried down a side street.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whew!&quot; he said, drawing in his breath.</p>
                    <p>A half block away, a small girl gazed at him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d better sneak,&quot; she called.</p>
                    <p>He walked homeward in a blinding snowstorm, reaching the ferry by dusk. The
                        cabins were filled with comfortable souls, who studied him curiously. His
                        head was still in such a whirl that he felt confused. All the wonder of the
                        twinkling lights of the river in a white storm passed for nothing. He
                        trudged doggedly on until he reached the flat. There he entered and found
                        the room warm. Carrie was gone. A couple of evening papers were lying on the
                        table where she left them. He <pb id="VAA2423-479" n="473"/> lit the gas and
                        sat down. Then he got up and stripped to examine his shoulder. It was a mere
                        scratch. He washed his hands and face, still in a brown study, apparently,
                        and combed his hair. Then he looked for something to eat, and finally, his
                        hunger gone, sat down in his comfortable rocking-chair. It was a wonderful
                        relief.</p>
                    <p>He put his hand to his chin, forgetting, for the moment, the papers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, after a time, his nature recovering
                        itself, &quot;that&apos;s a pretty tough game over
                        there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then he turned and saw the papers. With half a sigh he picked up the
                        &quot;World.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Strike Spreading in Brooklyn,&quot; he read. &quot;Rioting
                        Breaks Out in all Parts of the City.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He adjusted his paper very comfortably and continued. It was the one thing he
                        read with absorbing interest.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">A TOUCH OF SPRING: THE EMPTY SHELL</head>
                    <p>Those who look upon Hurstwood&apos;s Brooklyn venture as an error of
                        judgment will none the less realise the negative influence on him of the
                        fact that he had tried and failed. Carrie got a wrong idea of it. He said so
                        little that she imagined he had encountered nothing worse than the ordinary
                        roughnessquitting so soon in the face of this seemed trifling. He did not
                        want to work.</p>
                    <p>She was now one of a group of oriental beauties who, in the second act of the
                        comic opera, were paraded by the vizier before the new potentate as the
                        treasures of his harem. There was no word assigned to any of them, but on
                        the evening when Hurstwood was housing himself in the loft of the street-car
                        barn, the leading comedian and star, feeling exceedingly facetious, said in
                        a profound voice, which created a ripple of laughter:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, who are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>It merely happened to be Carrie who was courtesying before him. It might as
                        well have been any of the others, so far as he was concerned. He expected no
                        answer and a dull one would have been reproved. But Carrie, whose experience
                        and belief in herself gave her daring, courtesied sweetly again and
                        answered:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am yours truly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was a trivial thing to say, and yet something in <pb id="VAA2423-481"
                            n="475"/> the way she did it caught the audience, which laughed heartily
                        at the mock-fierce potentate towering before the young woman. The comedian
                        also liked it, hearing the laughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought your name was Smith,&quot; he returned, endeavouring
                        to get the last laugh.</p>
                    <p>Carrie almost trembled for her daring after she had said this. All members of
                        the company had been warned that to interpolate lines or
                        &quot;business&quot; meant a fine or worse. She did not snow what to
                        think.</p>
                    <p>As she was standing in her proper position in the wings, awaiting another
                        entry, the great comedian made his exit past her and paused in
                        recognition.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can just leave that in hereafter,&quot; he remarked, seeing
                        how intelligent she appeared. &quot;Don&apos;t add any more,
                        though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Carrie, humbly. When he went on she found
                        herself trembling violently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you&apos;re in luck,&quot; remarked another member of
                        the chorus. &quot;There isn&apos;t another one of us has got a
                        line.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was no gainsaying the value of this. Everybody in the company realised
                        that she had got a start. Carrie hugged herself when next evening the lines
                        got the same applause. She went home rejoicing, knowing that soon something
                        must come of it. It was Hurstwood who, by his presence, caused her merry
                        thoughts to flee and replaced them with sharp longings for an end of
                        distress.</p>
                    <p>The next day she asked him about his venture.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re not trying to run any cars except with police.
                        They don&apos;t want anybody just nownot before next week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Next week came, but Carrie saw no change. Hurstwood seemed more apathetic
                        than ever. He saw her <pb id="VAA2423-482" n="476"/> off mornings to
                        rehearsals and the like with the utmost calm. He read and read. Several
                        times he found himself staring at an item, but thinking of something else.
                        The first of these lapses that he sharply noticed concerned a hilarious
                        party he had once attended at a driving club, of which he had been a member.
                        He sat, gazing downward, and gradually thought he heard the old voices and
                        the clink of glasses.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re a dandy, Hurstwood,&quot; his friend Walker
                        said. He was standing again well dressed, smiling, good-natured, the
                        recipient of encores for a good story.</p>
                    <p>All at once he looked up. The room was so still it seemed ghostlike. He heard
                        the clock ticking audibly and half suspected that he had been dozing. The
                        paper was so straight in his hands, however, and the items he had been
                        reading so directly before him, that he rid himself of the doze idea. Still,
                        it seemed peculiar. When it occurred a second time, however, it did not seem
                        quite so strange.</p>
                    <p>Butcher and grocery man, baker and coal mannot the group with whom he was
                        then dealing, but those who had trusted him to the limitcalled. He met them
                        all blandly, becoming deft in excuse. At last he became bold, pretended to
                        be out, or waved them off.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They can&apos;t get blood out of a turnip,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;If I had it I&apos;d pay them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie&apos;s little soldier friend, Miss Osborne, seeing her succeeding,
                        had become a sort of satellite. Little Osborne could never of herself amount
                        to anything. She seemed to realise it in a sort of pussy-like way and
                        instinctively concluded to cling with her soft little claws to Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you&apos;ll get up,&quot; she kept telling Carrie with
                        admiration. &quot;You&apos;re so good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Timid as Carrie was, she was strong in capability.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-483" n="477"/>
                    <p>The reliance of others made her feel as if she must, and when she must she
                        dared. Experience of the world and of necessity was in her favour. No longer
                        the lightest word of a man made her head dizzy. She had learned that men
                        could change and fail. Flattery in its most palpable form had lost its force
                        with her. It required superioritykindly superiorityto move herthe
                        superiority of a genius like Ames.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t like the actors in our company,&quot; she told
                        Lola one day. &quot;They&apos;re all so struck on
                        themselves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you think Mr. Barclay&apos;s pretty
                        nice?&quot; inquired Lola, who had received a condescending smile or two
                        from that quarter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he&apos;s nice enough,&quot; answered Carrie;
                        &quot;but he isn&apos;t sincere. He assumes such an
                        air.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lola felt for her first hold upon Carrie in the following manner:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you paying room-rent where you are?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; answered Carrie. &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know where I could get the loveliest room and bath, cheap.
                        It&apos;s too big for me, but it would be just right for two, and the
                        rent is only six dollars a week for both.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In Seventeenth Street.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know as I&apos;d care to
                        change,&quot; said Carrie, who was already turning over the three-dollar
                        rate in her mind. She was thinking if she had only herself to support this
                        would leave her seventeen for herself.</p>
                    <p>Nothing came of this until after the Brooklyn adventure of
                        Hurstwood&apos;s and her success with the speaking part. Then she began
                        to feel as if she must be free. She thought of leaving Hurstwood and thus
                        making him act for himself, but he had developed such <pb id="VAA2423-484"
                            n="478"/> peculiar traits she feared he might resist any effort to throw
                        him off. He might hunt her out at the show and hound her in that way. She
                        did not wholly believe that he would, but he might. This, she knew, would be
                        an embarrassing thing if he made himself conspicuous in any way. It troubled
                        her greatly.</p>
                    <p>Things were precipitated by the offer of a better part. One of the actresses
                        playing the part of a modest sweetheart gave notice of leaving and Carrie
                        was selected.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much are you going to get?&quot; asked Miss Osborne, on
                        hearing the good news.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t ask him,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, find out. Goodness, you&apos;ll never get anything if you
                        don&apos;t ask. Tell them you must have forty dollars,
                        anyhow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly!&quot; exclaimed Lola. &quot;Ask &apos;em,
                        anyway.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie succumbed to this prompting, waiting, however, until the manager gave
                        her notice of what clothing she must have to fit the part.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much do I get?&quot; she inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thirty-five dollars,&quot; he replied.</p>
                    <p>Carrie was too much astonished and delighted to think of mentioning forty.
                        She was nearly beside herself, and almost hugged Lola, who clung to her at
                        the news.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t as much as you ought to get,&quot; said the
                        latter, &quot;especially when you&apos;ve got to buy
                        clothes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie remembered this with a start. Where to get the money? She had none
                        laid up for such an emergency. Rent day was drawing near.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not do it,&quot; she said, remembering her
                        necessity. &quot;I don&apos;t use the flat. I&apos;m not going
                        to give up my money this time. I&apos;ll move.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-485" n="479"/>
                    <p>Fitting into this came another appeal from Miss Osborne, more urgent than
                        ever.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come live with me, won&apos;t you?&quot; she pleaded.
                        &quot;We can have the loveliest room. It won&apos;t cost you hardly
                        anything that way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d like to,&quot; said Carrie frankly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, do,&quot; said Lola. &quot;We&apos;ll have such a
                        good time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie thought a while.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I believe I will,&quot; she said, and then added:
                        &quot;I&apos;ll have to see first, though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With the idea thus grounded, rent day approaching, and clothes for instant
                        purchase, she soon found excuse in Hurstwood&apos;s lassitude. He said
                        less and drooped more than ever.</p>
                    <p>As rent day approached, an idea grew in him. It was fostered by the demands
                        of creditors and the impossibility of holding up many more. Twenty-eight
                        dollars was too much for rent. &quot;It&apos;s hard on
                        her,&quot; he thought. &quot;We could get a cheaper
                        place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Stirred with this idea, he spoke at the breakfast table.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you think we pay too much rent here?&quot; he
                        asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed I do,&quot; said Carrie, not catching his drift.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should think we could get a smaller place,&quot; he
                        suggested. &quot;We don&apos;t need four rooms.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her countenance, had he been scrutinising her, would have exhibited the
                        disturbance she felt at this evidence of his determination to stay by her.
                        He saw nothing remarkable in asking her to come down lower.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know,&quot; she answered, growing
                        wary.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There must be places around here where we could get a couple of
                        rooms, which would do just as well.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-486" n="480"/>
                    <p>Her heart revolted. &quot;Never!&quot; she thought. Who would furnish
                        the money to move? To think of being in two rooms with him! She resolved to
                        spend her money for clothes quickly, before something terrible happened.
                        That very day she did it. Having done so, there was but one other thing to
                        do.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lola,&quot; she said, visiting her friend, &quot;I think
                        I&apos;ll come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, jolly!&quot; cried the latter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can we get it right away?&quot; she asked, meaning the
                        room.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; cried Lola.</p>
                    <p>They went to look at it. Carrie had saved ten dollars from her
                        expendituresenough for this and her board beside. Her enlarged salary would
                        not begin for ten days yetwould not reach her for seventeen. She paid half
                        of the six dollars with her friend.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, I&apos;ve just enough to get on to the end of the
                        week,&quot; she confided.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;ve got some,&quot; said Lola.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve got twenty-five dollars, if you need
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;I guess I&apos;ll get
                        along.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They decided to move Friday, which was two days away. Now that the thing was
                        settled, Carrie&apos;s heart misgave her. She felt very much like a
                        criminal in the matter. Each day looking at Hurstwood, she had realised
                        that, along with the disagreeableness of his attitude, there was something
                        pathetic.</p>
                    <p>She looked at him the same evening she had made up her mind to go, and now he
                        seemed not so shiftless and worthless, but run down and beaten upon by
                        chance. His eyes were not keen, his face marked, his hands flabby. She
                        thought his hair had a touch of grey. All unconscious of his doom, he rocked
                        and read his paper, while she glanced at him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-487" n="481"/>
                    <p>Knowing that the end was so near, she became rather solicitous.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you go over and get some canned peaches?&quot; she asked
                        Hurstwood, laying down a two-dollar bill.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; he said, looking in wonder at the money.</p>
                    <p>&quot;See if you can get some nice asparagus,&quot; she added.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll cook it for dinner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood rose and took the money, slipping on his overcoat and getting his
                        hat. Carrie noticed that both of these articles of apparel were old and poor
                        looking in appearance. It was plain enough before, but now it came home with
                        peculiar force. Perhaps he couldn&apos;t help it, after all. He had done
                        well in Chicago. She remembered his fine appearance the days he had met her
                        in the park. Then he was so sprightly, so clean. Had it been all his
                        fault?</p>
                    <p>He came back and laid the change down with the food.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d better keep it,&quot; she observed.
                        &quot;We&apos;ll need other things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, with a sort of pride; you keep
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, go on and keep it,&quot; she replied, rather unnerved.
                        &quot;There&apos;ll be other things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He wondered at this, not knowing the pathetic figure he had become in her
                        eyes. She restrained herself with difficulty from showing a quaver in her
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>To say truly, this would have been Carrie&apos;s attitude in any case.
                        She had looked back at times upon her parting from Drouet and had regretted
                        that she had served him so badly. She hoped she would never meet him again,
                        but she was ashamed of her conduct. Not that she had any choice in the final
                        separation. She had gone willingly to seek him, with sympathy in her heart,
                        when Hurstwood had reported him ill. There <pb id="VAA2423-488" n="482"/>
                        was something cruel somewere, and not being able to track it mentally to its
                        logical lair, she concluded with feeling that he would never understand what
                        Hurstwood had done and would see hard-hearted decision in her deed; hence
                        her shame. Not that she cared for him. She did not want to make any one who
                        had been good to her feel badly.</p>
                    <p>She did not realise what she was doing by allowing these feelings to possess
                        her. Hurstwood, noticing the kindness, conceived better of her.
                        &quot;Carrie&apos;s good-natured, anyhow,&quot; he thought.</p>
                    <p>Going to Miss Osborne&apos;s that afternoon, she found that little lady
                        packing and singing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you come over with me to-day?&quot; she
                        asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I can&apos;t,&quot; said Carrie.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll be there Friday. Would you mind lending me the
                        twenty-five dollars you spoke of?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, no,&quot; said Lola, going for her purse.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to get some other things,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, that&apos;s all right,&quot; answered the little girl,
                        good-naturedly, glad to be of service.</p>
                    <p>It had been days since Hurstwood had done more than go to the grocery or to
                        the news-stand. Now the weariness of indoors was upon himhad been for two
                        daysbut chill, grey weather had held him back. Friday broke fair and warm.
                        It was one of those lovely harbiners of spring, gives as a sign in dreary
                        winter that earth is not forsaken of warmth and beauty. The blue heaven,
                        holding its one golden orb, poured down a crystal wash of warm light. It was
                        plain, from the voice of the sparrows, that all was halcyon outside. Carrie
                        raised the front windows, and felt the south wind blowing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s lovely out to-day,&quot; she remarked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-489" n="483"/>
                    <p>&quot;Is it?&quot;said Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>After breakfast, he immediately got his other clothes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you be back for lunch?&quot; asked Carrie, nervously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>He went out into the streets and tramped north, along Seventh Avenue, idly
                        fixing upon the Harlem River as an objective point. He had seen some ships
                        up there, the time he had called upon the brewers. He wondered how the
                        territory thereabouts was growing.</p>
                    <p>Passing Fifty-ninth Street, he took the west side of Central Park, which he
                        followed to Seventy-eighth Street. Then he remembered the neighbourhood and
                        turned over to look at the mass of buildings erected. It was very much
                        improved. The great open spaces were filling up. Coming back, he kept to the
                        Park until IIoth Street, and then turned into Seventh Avenue again, reaching
                        the pretty river by one o&apos;clock.</p>
                    <p>There it ran winding before his gaze, shining brightly in the clear light,
                        between the undulating banks on the right and the tall, tree-covered heights
                        on the left. The spring-like atmosphere woke him to a sense of its
                        loveliness, and for a few moments he stood looking at it, folding his hands
                        behind his back. Then he turned and followed it toward the east side, idly
                        seeking the ships he had seen. It was four o&apos;clock before the
                        waning day, with its suggestion of a cooler evening, caused him to return.
                        He was hungry and would enjoy eating in the warm room.</p>
                    <p>When he reached the flat by half-past five, it was still dark. He knew that
                        Carrie was not there, not only because there was no light showing through
                        the transom, but because the evening papers were stuck between the outside
                        knob and the door. He opened with his key and went in. Everything was still
                        dark. Lighting <pb id="VAA2423-490" n="484"/> the gas, he sat down,
                        preparing to wait a little while. Even if Carrie did come now, dinner would
                        be late. He read until six, then got up to fix something for himself.</p>
                    <p>As he did so, he noticed that the room seemed a little queer. What was it? He
                        looked around, as if he missed something, and then saw an envelope near
                        where he had been sitting. It spoke for itself, almost without further
                        action on his part.</p>
                    <p>Reaching over, he took it, a sort of chill settling upon him even while he
                        reached. The crackle of the envelope in his hands was loud. Green paper
                        money lay soft within the note. <q direct="unspecified">
                            <p>&quot;Dear George,&quot; he read, crunching the money in one
                                hand. &quot;I&apos;m going away. I&apos;m not coming
                                back any more. It&apos;s no use trying to keep up the flat; I
                                can&apos;t do it. I wouldn&apos;t mind helping you, if I
                                could, but I can&apos;t support us both, and pay the rent. I
                                need what little I make to pay for my clothes. I&apos;m leaving
                                twenty dollars. It&apos;s all I have just now. You can do
                                whatever you like with the furniture. I won&apos;t want it.C<hi
                                    rend="sc">ARRIE</hi>.&quot;</p>
                        </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>He dropped the note and looked quietly round. Now he knew what he missed. It
                        was the little ornamental clock, which was hers. It had gone from the
                        mantelpiece. He went into the front room, his bedroom, the parlour, lighting
                        the gas as he went. From the chiffonier had gone the knick-knacks of silver
                        and plate. From the table-top, the lace coverings. He opened the wardrobeno
                        clothes of hers. He opened the drawersnothing of hers. Her trunk was gone
                        from its accustomed place. Back in his own room hung his old clothes, just
                        as he had left them. Nothing else was gone.</p>
                    <p>He stepped into the parlour and stood for a few moments looking vacantly at
                        the floor. The silence grew <pb id="VAA2423-491" n="485"/> oppressive. The
                        little flat seemed wonderfully deserted. He wholly forgot that he was
                        hungry, that it was only dinner-time. It seemed later in the night.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, he found that the money was still in his hands. There were twenty
                        dollars in all, as she had said. Now he walked back, leaving the lights
                        ablaze, and feeling as if the flat were empty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll get out of this,&quot; he said to himself.</p>
                    <p>Then the sheer loneliness of his situation rushed upon him in full.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Left me!&quot; he muttered, and repeated, &quot;left
                        me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The place that had been so comfortable, where he had spant that had beeb so
                        comfortable, where he Something colder and chillier confronted him. He sank
                        down in his chair, resting his chin in his handmere sensation, without
                        thought, holding him.</p>
                    <p>Then something like a bereaved affection and self-pity swept over him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She needn&apos;t have gone away,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I&apos;d have got something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He sat a long while without rocking, and added quite clearly, out loud:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I tried, didn&apos;t I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>At midnight he was still rocking, staring at the floor.</p>

                    <p>Installed in her comfortable room, Carrie wondered how Hurstwood had taken
                        her departure. She arranged a few things hastily and then left for the
                        theatre, half expecting to encounter him at the door. Not finding him, her
                        dread lifted, and she felt more kindly toward him. She quite forgot him
                        until about to come out, after the show, when the chance of his being there
                        frightened her. As day after day passed and she heard nothing at all, the
                        thought of being bothered by him passed. In a little while she was, except
                        for occasional thoughts, wholly free of the gloom with which her life had
                        been weighed in the flat.</p>
                    <p>It is curious to note how quickly a profession absords one. Carrie became
                        wise in theatrical lore, hearing the gossip of little Lola. She learned what
                        the theatrical papers were, which ones published items about actresses and
                        the like. She began to read the newspaper notices, not only of the opera in
                        which she had so small a part, but of others. Gradually the desire for
                        notice took hold of her. She longed to be renowned like others, and read
                        with avidity all the complimentary or critical comments made concerning
                        others high in her profession. The showy world in which her interest lay
                        completely absorbed her.</p>
                    <p>It was about this time that the newspapers and magazines were beginning to
                        pay that illustrative attention <pb id="VAA2423-493" n="487"/> to the
                        beauties of the stage which has since become fervid. The newspapers, and
                        particularly the Sunday newspapers, indulged in large decorative theatrical
                        pages, in which the faces and forms of well-known theatrical celebrities
                        appeared, enclosed with artistic scrolls. The magazines alsoor at least one
                        or two of the newer onespublished occasional portraits of pretty stars, and
                        now and again photos of scenes from various plays. Carrie watched these with
                        growing interest. When would a scene from her opera appear? When would some
                        paper think her photo worth while?</p>
                    <p>The Sunday before taking her new part she scanned the theatrical pages for
                        some little notice. It would have accorded with her expectations if nothing
                        had been said, but there in the squibs, tailing off several more substantial
                        items, was a wee notice. Carrie read it with a tingling body: <q
                            direct="unspecified">
                            <p>&quot;The part of Katisha, the country maid, in &apos;The
                                Wives of Abdul&apos; at the Broadway, heretofore played by Inez
                                Carew, will be hereafter filled by Carrie Madenda, one of the
                                cleverest members of the chorus.&quot;</p>
                        </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>Carrie hugged herself with delight. Oh, wasn&apos;t it just fine! At
                        last! The first, the long-hoped for, the delightful notice! And they called
                        her clever. She could hardly restrain herself from laughing loudly. Had Lola
                        seen it?</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ve got a notice here of the part I&apos;m going
                        to play to-morrow night,&quot; said Carrie to her friend.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, jolly! Have they?&quot; cried Lola, running to her.
                        &quot;That&apos;s all right,&quot; she said, looking.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll get more now, if you do well. I had my picture in
                        the &apos;World&apos; once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you?&quot; asked Carrie.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-494" n="488"/>
                    <p>&quot;Did I? Well, I should say,&quot; returned the little girl.
                        &quot;They had a frame around it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ve never published my picture.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But they will,&quot; said Lola. &quot;You&apos;ll see.
                        You do better than most that get theirs in now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie felt deeply grateful for this. She almost loved Lola for the sympathy
                        and praise she extended. It was so helpful to herso almost necessary.</p>
                    <p>Fulfilling her part capably brought another notice in the papers that she was
                        doing her work acceptably. This pleased her immensely. She began to think
                        the world was taking note of her.</p>
                    <p>The first week she got her thirty-five dollars, it seemed an enormous sum.
                        Paying only three dollars for room rent seemed ridiculous. After giving Lola
                        her twenty-five, she still had seven dollars left. With four left over from
                        previous earnings, she had eleven. Five of this went to pay the regular
                        installment on the clothes she had to buy. The neat week she was even in
                        greater feather. Now, only three dollars need be paid for room rent and five
                        on her clothes. The rest she had for food and her own whims.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d better save a little for summer,&quot; cautioned
                        Lola. &quot;We&apos;ll probably close in May.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I intend to,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>The regular entrance of thirty-five dollars a week to one who has endured
                        scant allowances for several years is a demoralising thing. Carrie found her
                        purse bursting with good green bills of comfortable denominations. Having no
                        one dependent upon her, she began to buy pretty clothes and pleasing
                        trinkets, to eat well, and to ornament her room. Friends were not long in
                        gathering about. She met a few young men who belonged to Lola&apos;s
                        staff. The members of the opera <pb id="VAA2423-495" n="489"/> company made
                        her acquaintance without the formality of introduction. One of these
                        discovered a fancy for her. On several occasions he strolled home with
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s stop in and have a rarebit,&quot; he suggested
                        one midnight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>In the rosy restaurant, filled with the merry lovers of late hours, she found
                        herself criticising this man. He was too stilted, too self-opinionated. He
                        did not talk of anything that lifted her above the common run of clothes and
                        material success. When it was all over, he smiled most graciously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Got to go straight home, have you?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered, with an air of quiet
                        understanding.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s not so inexperienced as she looks,&quot; he
                        thought, and thereafter his respect and ardour were increased.</p>
                    <p>She could not help sharing in Lola&apos;s love for a good time. There
                        were days when they went carriage riding, nights when after the show they
                        dined, afternoons when they strolled along Broadway, tastefully dressed. She
                        was getting in the meropolitan whirl of pleasure.</p>
                    <p>At last her picture appeared in one of the weeklies. She had not known of it,
                        and it took her breath. &quot;Miss Carrie Madenda,&quot; it was
                        labelled. &quot;One of the favourites of &apos;The Wives of
                        Abdul&apos; company.&quot; At Lola&apos;s advice she had had
                        some pictures taken by Sarony. They had got one there. She thought of going
                        down and buying a few copies of the paper, but remembered that there was no
                        one she knew well enough to send them to. Only Lola, apparently, in all the
                        world was interested.</p>
                    <p>The metropolis is a cold place socially, and Carrie soon found that a little
                        money brought her nothing.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-496" n="490"/>
                    <p>The world of wealth and distinction was quite as far away as ever. She could
                        feel that there was no warm, sympathetic friendship back of the easy
                        merriment with which many approached her. All seemed to be seeking their own
                        amusement, regardless of the possible sad consequence to others. So much for
                        the lessons of Hurstwood and Drouet.</p>
                    <p>In April she learned that the opera would probably last until the middle or
                        the end of May, according to the size of the audiences. Next season it would
                        go on the road. She wondered if she would be with it. As usual, Miss
                        Osborne, owing to her moderate salary, was for securing a home
                        engagement.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re putting on a summer play at the Casino,&quot;
                        she announced, after figuratively putting her ear to the ground.
                        &quot;Let&apos;s try and get in that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m willing,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>They tried in time and were apprised of the proper date to apply again. That
                        was May 16th. Meanwhile their own show closed May 5th.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Those that want to go with the show next season,&quot; said the
                        manager, &quot;will have to sign this week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you sign,&quot; advised Lola. &quot;I
                        wouldn&apos;t go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; said Carrie, &quot;but maybe I can&apos;t
                        get anything else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I won&apos;t,&quot; said the little girl, who had a
                        resource in her admirers. &quot;I went once and I didn&apos;t have
                        anything at the end of the season.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie thought this over. She had never been on the road.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We can get along,&quot; added Lola. &quot;I always
                        have.&quot; Carrie did not sign.</p>
                    <p>The manager who was putting on the summer skit at the Casino had never heard
                        of Carrie, but the several <pb id="VAA2423-497" n="491"/> notices she had
                        received, her published picture, and the programme bearing her name had some
                        little weight with him. He gave her a silent part at thirty dollars a
                        week.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t I tell you?&quot; said Lola. &quot;It
                        doesn&apos;t do you any good to go away front New York. They forget all
                        about you if you do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Now, because Carrie was pretty, the gentlemen who made up the advance
                        illustrations of shows about to appear for the Sunday papers selected
                        Carrie&apos;s photo along with others to illustrate the announcement.
                        Because she was very pretty, they gave it excellent space and drew scrolls
                        about it. Carrie was delighted. Still, the management did not seem to have
                        seen anything of it. At least, no more attention was paid to her than
                        before. At the same time there seemed very little in her part. It consisted
                        of standing around in all sorts of scenes, a silent little Quakeress. The
                        author of the skit had fancied that a great deal could be made of such a
                        part, given to the right actress, but now, since it had been doled out to
                        Carrie, he would as leave have had it cut out.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t kick, old man,&quot; remarked the manager.
                        &quot;If it don&apos;t go the first week we will cut it
                        out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie had no warning of this halcyon intention. She practiced her part
                        ruefully, feeling that she was effectually shelved. At the dress rehearsal
                        she was disconsolate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That isn&apos;t so had,&quot; said the author, the manager
                        noting the curious effect which Carrie&apos;s blues had upon the part.
                        &quot;Tell her to frown a little more when Sparks dances.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie did not know it, but there was the least show of wrinkles between her
                        eyes and her mouth was puckered quaintly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-498" n="492"/>
                    <p>&quot;Frown a little more, Miss Madenda,&quot; said the stage
                        manager.</p>
                    <p>Carrie instantly brightened up, thinking he had meant it as a rebuke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No; frown,&quot; he said. &quot;Frown as you did
                        before.&quot; Carrie looked at him in astonishment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean it,&quot; he said. &quot;Frown hard when Mr. Sparks
                        dances. I want to see how it looks.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was easy enough to do. Carrie scowled. The effect was something so quaint
                        and droll it caught even the manager.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That <hi rend="i">is</hi> good,&quot; he said. &quot;If
                        she&apos;ll do that all through, I think it will take.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Going over to Carrie, he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Suppose you try frowning all through. Do it hard. Look mad.
                        It&apos;ll make the part really funny.&quot;</p>
                    <p>On the opening night it looked to Carrie as if there were nothing to her
                        part, after all. The happy, sweltering audience did not seem to see her in
                        the first net. She frowned and frowned, but to no effect. Eyes were riveted
                        upon the more elaborate efforts of the stars.</p>
                    <p>In the second net, the crowd, wearied by a dull conversation, roved with its
                        eyes about the stage and sighted her. There she was, grey-suited,
                        sweet-faced, demure, but scowling. At first the general idea was that she
                        was temporarily irritated, that the look was genuine and not fun at all. As
                        she went on frowning, looking now at one principal and now at the other, the
                        audience began to smile. The portly gentlemen in the front rows began to
                        feel that she was a delicious little morsel. It was the kind of frown they
                        would have loved to force away with kisses. All the gentlemen yearned toward
                        her. She was capital.</p>
                    <p>At last, the chief comedian, singing in the centre of the stage, noticed a
                        giggle where it was not expected.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-499" n="493"/>
                    <p>Then another and another. When the place came for loud applause it was only
                        moderate. What could be the trouble? He realised that something was up.</p>
                    <p>All at once, after an exit, he caught sight of Carrie. She was frowning alone
                        on the stage and the audience was giggling and laughing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By George, I won&apos;t stand that!&quot; thought the
                        thespian. &quot;I&apos;m not going to have my work cut up by some
                        one else. Either she quits that when I do my turn or I quit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, that&apos;s all right,&quot; said the manager, when
                        the kick came. &quot;That&apos;s what she&apos;s supposed to do.
                        You needn&apos;t pay any attention to that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But she ruins my work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, she don&apos;t,&quot; returned the former, soothingly.
                        &quot;It&apos;s only a little fun on the side.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is, eh?&quot; exclaimed the big comedian. &quot;She
                        killed my hand all right. I&apos;m not going to stand
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, wait until after the show. Wait until tomorrow.
                        We&apos;ll see what we can do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The next act, however, settled what was to be done. Carrie was the chief
                        feature of the play. The audience, the more it studied her, the more it
                        indicated its delight. Every other feature paled beside the quaint, teasing,
                        delightful atmosphere which Carrie contributed while on the stage. Manager
                        and company realised she had made a hit.</p>
                    <p>The critics of the daily papers completed her triumph. There were long
                        notices in praise of the quality of the burlesque, touched with recurrent
                        references to Carrie. The contagious mirth of the thing was repeatedly
                        emphasised. <q direct="unspecified">
                            <p>&quot;Miss Madenda presents one of the most delightful bits of
                                character work ever seen on the Casino stage,&quot; observed the
                                sage critic of the &quot;Sun.&quot; &quot;It is a bit of
                                quiet, unassuming drollery <pb id="VAA2423-500" n="494"/> which
                                warms like good wine. Evidently the part was not intended to take
                                precedence, as Miss Madenda is not often on the stage, but the
                                audience, with the characteristic perversity of such bodies,
                                selected for itself. The little Quakeress was marked for a favorite
                                the moment she appeared, and thereafter easily held attention and
                                applause. The vagaries of fortune are indeed curious.&quot;</p>
                        </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>The critic of the &quot;Evening World,&quot; seeking as usual to
                        establish a catch phrase which should &quot;go&quot; with the town,
                        wound up by advising: &quot;If you wish to be merry, see Carrie
                        frown.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The result was miraculous so far as Carrie&apos;s fortune was concerned.
                        Even during the morning she received a congratulatory message from the
                        manager. &quot;You seem to have taken the town by storm,&quot; he
                        wrote. &quot;This is delightful. I am as glad for your sake as for my
                        own.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The author also sent word.</p>
                    <p>That evening when she entered the theatre the manager had a most pleasant
                        greeting for her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Stevens,&quot; he said, referring to the author,
                        &quot;is preparing a little song, which he would like you to sing next
                        week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I can&apos;t sing,&quot; returned Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t anything difficult. &apos;It&apos;s
                        something that is very simple,&apos; he says, &apos;and would suit
                        you exactly &apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, I wouldn&apos;t mind trying,&quot; said Carrie,
                        archly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would you mind coming to the box-office a few moments before you
                        dress?&quot; observed the manager, in addition.
                        &quot;There&apos;s a little matter I want to speak to you
                        about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied Carrie.</p>
                    <p>In that latter place the manager produced a paper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, of course,&quot; he said, &quot;we want to be fair
                        with you in the matter of salary. Your contract here only <pb
                            id="VAA2423-501" n="495"/> calls for thirty dollars a week for the next
                        three months. How would it do to make it, say, one hundred and fifty a week
                        and extend it for twelve months?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, very well,&quot; said Carrie, scarcely believing her
                        ears.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Supposing, then, you just sign this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie cooked and beheld a new contract made out like the other one, with the
                        exception of the new figures of salary and time. With a hand trembling from
                        excitement she affixed her name.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One hundred and fifty a week!&quot; she murmured, when she was
                        again alone. She found, after allas what millionaire has not?that there was
                        no realising, in consciousness, the meaning of large sums. It was only a
                        shimmering, glittering phrase in which lay a world of possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Down in a third-rate Bleecker Street hotel, the brooding Hurstwood read the
                        dramatic item covering Carrie&apos;s success, without at first realising
                        who was meant. Then suddenly it came to him and he read the whole thing over
                        again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s her, all right, I guess,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Then he looked about upon a dingy, moth-eaten hotel lobby.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess she&apos;s struck it,&quot; he thought, a picture
                        of the old shiny, plush-covered world coming back, with its lights, its
                        ornaments, its carriages, and flowers. Ah, she was in the walled city now!
                        Its splendid gates had opened, admitting her from a cold, dreary outside.
                        She seemed a creature afar offlike every other celebrity he had known.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, let her have it,&quot; he said. &quot;I
                        won&apos;t bother her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was the grim resolution of a bent, bedraggled, but unbroken pride.</p>

                    <p>When Carrie got back on the stage, she found that over night her
                        dressing-room had been changed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are to use this room, Miss Madenda,&quot; said one of the
                        stage lackeys.</p>
                    <p>No longer any need of climbing several flights of steps to a small coop
                        shared with another. Instead, a comparatively large and commodious chamber
                        with conveniences not enjoyed by the small fry overhead. She breathed deeply
                        and with delight. Her sensations were more physical&apos; than mental.
                        In fact, she was scarcely thinking at all. Heart and body were having their
                        say.</p>
                    <p>Gradually the deference and congratulation gave her a mental appreciation of
                        her state. She was no longer ordered, but requested, and that politely. The
                        other members of the cast looked at her enviously as she came out arrayed in
                        her simple habit, which she wore all through the play. All those who had
                        supposedly been her equals and superiors now smiled the smile of
                        sociability, as much as to say: &quot;How friendly we have always
                        been.&quot; Only the star comedian whose part had been so deeply injured
                        stalked by himself. Figuratively, he could not kiss the hand that smote
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Doing her simple part, Carrie gradually realised the meaning of the applause
                        which was for her, and it was sweet. She felt mildly guilty of
                        somethingperhaps <pb id="VAA2423-503" n="497"/> unworthiness. When her
                        associates addressed her in the wings she only smiled weakly. The pride and
                        daring of place were not for her. It never once crossed her mind to be
                        reserved or haughtyto be other than she had been. After the performances she
                        rode to her room with Lola, in a carriage provided.</p>
                    <p>Then came a week in which the first fruits of success were offered to her
                        lipsbowl after bowl. It did not matter that her splendid salary had not
                        begun. The world seemed satisfied with the promise. She began to get letters
                        and cards. A Mr. Witherswhom she did not know from Adamhaving learned by
                        some hook or crook where she resided, bowed himself politely in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will excuse me for intruding,&quot; he said; &quot;but
                        have you been thinking of changing your apartments?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hadn&apos;t thought of it,&quot; returned Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I am connected with the Wellingtonthe new hotel on Broadway.
                        You have probably seen notices of it in the gapers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie recognised the name as standing for one of the newest and most
                        imposing hostelries. She had heard it spoken of as having a splendid
                        restaurant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just so,&quot; went on Mr. Withers, accepting her
                        acknowledgment of familiarity. &quot;We have some very elegant rooms at
                        present which we would like to have you look at, if you have not made up
                        your mind where you intend to reside for the summer. Our apartments are
                        perfect in every detailhot and cold water, private baths, special hall
                        service for every floor, elevators, and all that. You know what our
                        restaurant is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at him quietly. She was wondering whether he took her to be a
                        millionaire.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are your rates?&quot; she inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, now, that is what I came to talk with you <pb
                            id="VAA2423-504" n="498"/> privately about. Our regular rates are
                        anywhere from three to fifty dollars a day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mercy!&quot; interrupted Carrie. &quot;I couldn&apos;t
                        pay any such rate as that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know how you feel about it,&quot; exclaimed Mr. Withers,
                        halting. &quot;But just let me explain. I said those are our regular
                        rates. Like every other hotel we make special ones, however. Possibly you
                        have not thought about it, but your name is worth something to
                        us&quot;.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; ejaculated Carrie, seeing at a glance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course. Every hotel depends upon the repute of its patrons. A
                        well-known actress like yourself,&quot; and he bowed politely, while
                        Carrie flushed, &quot;draws attention to the hotel, andalthough you may
                        not believe itpatrons.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; returned Carrie, vacantly, trying to arrange
                        this curious proposition in her mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now,&quot; continued Mr. Withers, swaying his derby hat softly
                        and beating one of his polished shoes upon the floor, &quot;I want to
                        arrange, if possible, to have you come and stop at the Wellington. You need
                        not trouble about terms. In fact, we need hardly discuss them. Anything will
                        do for the summera mere figureanything that you think you could afford to
                        pay.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie was about to interrupt, but he gave her no chance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can come to-day or to-morrowthe earlier the betterand we will
                        give you your choice of nice, light, outside rooms the very best we
                        have.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re very kind,&quot; said Carrie, touched by the
                        agent&apos;s extreme affability. &quot;I should like to come very
                        much. I would want to pay what is right, however. I shouldn&apos;t want
                        to&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-505" n="499"/>
                    <p>&quot;You need not trouble about that at all,&quot; interrupted Mr.
                        Withers. &quot;We can arrange that to your entire satisfaction at any
                        time. If three dollars a day in a satisfactory to you, it will be so to us.
                        All you have to do is to pay that sum to the clerk at the end of the week or
                        month, just as you wish, and he will give you a receipt for what the rooms
                        would cost if charged for at our regular rates.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The speaker paused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Suppose you come and look at the rooms,&quot; he added.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d be glad to,&quot; said Carrie, &quot;but I
                        have a rehearsal this morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did not mean at once,&quot;he returned.&quot;Any time
                        will do. Would this afternoon be inconvenient?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not at all &quot;said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly she remembered Lola, who was out at the time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have a room-mate,&quot; she added, &quot;who will have to
                        go wherever I do. I forgot about that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, very well,&quot; said Mr. Withers, blandly. &quot;It is
                        for you to say whom you want with you. As I say, all that can be arranged to
                        suit yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He bowed and backed toward the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;At four, then, we may expect you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will be there to show you,&quot; and so Mr. Withers
                        withdrew.</p>
                    <p>After rehearsal Carrie informed Lola.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did they really?&quot; exclaimed the latter, thinking of the
                        Wellington as a group of managers. &quot;Isn&apos;t that fine? Oh,
                        jolly! It&apos;s so swell. That&apos;s where we dined that night we
                        went with those two Cushing boys. Don&apos; t you know?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I remembered,&quot; said Carrie</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-506" n="500"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it&apos;s as fine as it can be.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;d better be going up there,&quot; observed Carrie,
                        later in the afternoon.</p>
                    <p>The rooms which Mr. Withers displayed to Carrie and Lola were three and batha
                        suite on the parlour floor. They were done in chocolate and dark red, with
                        rugs and hangings to match. Three windows looked down in to busy Broadway on
                        the east, three into a side street which crossed there. There were two
                        lovely bedrooms, set with brass and white enamel beds, white, ribbon-trimmed
                        chairs and chiffoniers to match. In the third room, or parlour, was a piano,
                        a heavy piano lamp, with a shade of gorgeous pattern, a library table,
                        several huge easy rockers, some dado book shelves, and a gilt curio case,
                        filled with oddities. Pictures were upon the walls, soft Turkish pillows
                        upon the divan, footstools of brown plush upon the floor. Such
                        accommodations would ordinarily cost a hundred dollars a week.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, lovely!&quot; exclaimed Lola, walking about.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is comfortable,&quot; said Carrie, who was lifting a lace
                        curtain and looking down into crowded Broadway.</p>
                    <p>The bath was a handsome affair, done in white enamel, with a large,
                        blue-bordered stone tub and nickel trimmings. It was bright and commodious,
                        with a bevelled mirror set in the wall at one end and incandescent lights
                        arranged in three places.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you find these satisfactory?&quot; observed Mr. Withers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, very,&quot; answered Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, any time you find it convenient to move in, they are
                        ready. The boy will bring you the keys at the door.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie noted the elegantly carpeted and decorated hall, the marbelled lobby,
                        and showy waiting-room. <pb id="VAA2423-507" n="501"/> It was such a place
                        as she had often dreamed of occupying.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess we&apos;d better move right away,
                        don&apos;&apos;t you think so?&quot; she observed to Lola,
                        thinking of the commonplace champer in Seventeenth Street.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, by all means,&quot; said the latter.</p>
                    <p>The next day her trunks left for the new abode.</p>
                    <p>Dressing, after the matine on Wednesday, a knock came at her dressing-room
                        door.</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at the card handed by the boy and suffered a shock of
                        surprise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell her I&apos;ll be right out,&quot; she said softly.
                        Then, looking at the card, added: &quot;Mrs. Vance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, you little sinner,&quot; the latter exclaimed, as she saw
                        carrie coming toward her across the now vacant stage. &quot;How in the
                        world did this happen?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie laughed meriely. There was no trace of embrasment in her
                        frient&apos;s manner. You would have thought that the long separation
                        had come about accidentally.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know&quot; returned Carrie, warmimg, in spite
                        of her first troubled feelings, toward this handsome, good-natured young
                        matron.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you know, I saw your picture in the Sunday paper, but your
                        name threw me off. I thought it must be you or somebody that looked just
                        like you, and I said: &apos;Well, now, I will go right down there and
                        see.&apos; I was never more surprised in my life. How are you,
                        anyway?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, very well,&quot; returned Carrie. &quot;How have you
                        been?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fine. But aren&apos;t you a success! Dear, oh! All the papers
                        talking about you. I should think you would be just too proud to breathe. I
                        was almost afraid to come back here this afternoon.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-508" n="502"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, nonsense,&quot; said Carrie, blushing. &quot;You know
                        I&apos;d be glad to see you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, anyhow, here you are. Can&apos;t you come up and take
                        dinner with use now? Where are you stopping?</p>
                    <p>&quot;At the Wellington,&quot; said Carrie, who permitted herself a
                        touch of pride in the acknowledgment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, are you?&quot; exclaimed the other, upon whom the name was
                        not without its proper effect.</p>
                    <p>Tactfully, Mrs. Vance avoided the subject of Hurstwood, of whom she could not
                        help thinking. No doubt Carrie had left hint. That much she surmised.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t think I can,&quot; said Carrie,
                        &quot;to-night. I have so little time. I must be back here by 7.30.
                        Won&apos;t you come and dine with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d be delighted, but I can&apos;t to-night,&quot;
                        said Mrs. Vance, studying Carrie&apos;s fine appearance. The
                        latter&apos;s good fortune made her seem more than ever worthy and
                        delightful in the other&apos;s eyes. &quot;I promised faithfully to
                        be home at six.&quot; Glancing at the small gold watch pinned to her
                        bosom, she added: &quot;I must be going, too. Tell me when
                        you&apos;re coming up, if at all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, any time you like,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, to-morrow then. I&apos;m living at the Chelsea
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Moved again?&quot; exclaimed Carrie, laughing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. You know I can&apos;t stay six months in one place. I just
                        have to move. Remember nowhalf-past five.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t forget,&quot; said Carrie, casting a glance at
                        her as she went away. Then it came to her that she was as good as this woman
                        nowperhaps better. Something in the other&apos;s solicitude and interest
                        made her feel as if she were the one to condescend.</p>
                    <p>Now, as on each preceding day, letters were handed <pb id="VAA2423-509"
                            n="503"/> her by the doorman at the Casino. This was a feature which had
                        rapidly developed since Monday. What they contained she well knew. <hi
                            rend="i">Mash notes</hi> were old affairs in their mildest form. She
                        remembered having received her first one far back in Columbia City. Since
                        then, as a chorus girl, she had received othersgentlemen who prayed for an
                        engagement. They were common sport between her and Lola, who received some
                        also. They both frequently made light of them.</p>
                    <p>Now, however, they came thick and fast. Gentlemen with fortunes did not
                        hesitate to note, as an addition to their own amiable collection of virtues,
                        that they had their horses and carriages. Thus one:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have a million in my own right. I could give you every luxury.
                        There isn&apos;t anything you could ask for that you couldn&apos;t
                        have. I say this, not because I want to speak of my money, but because I
                        love you and wish to gratify your every desire. It is love that prompts me
                        to write. Will you not give me one half-hour in which to plead my cause?</p>
                    <p>Such of these letters as came while Carrie was still in the Seventeenth
                        Street place were read with more interestthough never delightthan those
                        which arrived after she was installed in her luxurious quarters at the
                        Wellington. Even there her vanityor that self-appreciation which, in its
                        more rabid form, is called vanitywas not sufficiently cloyed to make these
                        things wearisome. Adulation, being new in any form, pleased her. Only she
                        was sufficiently wise to distinguish between her old condition and her new
                        one. She had not had fame or money before. Now they had come. She had not
                        had adulation and affectionate propositions before. Now they had come.
                        Wherefore? She smiled to think that men should suddenly find her so much
                        more attractive. In the least way it incited her to coolness and
                        indifference.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-510" n="504"/>
                    <p>&quot;Do look here,&quot; she remarked to Lola. &quot;See what
                        this man says: &apos; If you will only deign to grant me one
                        half-hour,&apos;&quot; she repeated, with an imitation of languor.
                        &quot;The idea. Aren&apos;t men silly?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He must have lots of money, the way he talks,&quot; observed
                        Lola.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s what they all say,&quot; said Carrie,
                        innocently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you see him,&quot; suggested Lola,
                        &quot;and hear what he has to say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed I won&apos;t,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;I know
                        what he&apos;d say. I don&apos;t want to meet anybody that
                        way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lola looked at her with big, merry eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He couldn&apos;t hurt you,&quot; she returned.
                        &quot;You might have some fun with him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re awfully queer,&quot; returned the little,
                        blue-eyed soldier.</p>
                    <p>Thus crowded fortune. For this whole week, though her large salary had not
                        yet arrived, it was as if the world understood and trusted her. Without
                        moneyor the requisite sum, at leastshe enjoyed the luxuries which money
                        could buy. For her the doors of fine places seemed to open quite without the
                        asking. These palatial chambers, how marvellously they came to her. The
                        elegant apartments of Mrs. Vance in the Chelseathese were hers. Men sent
                        flowers, love notes, offers of fortune. And still her dreams ran riot. The
                        one hundred and fifty! the one hundred and fifty! What a door to an
                        Aladdin&apos;s cave it seemed to be. Each day, her head almost turned by
                        developments, her fancies of what her fortune most be, with ample money,
                        grew and multiplied. She conceived of delights which were notsaw lights of
                        joy that never were on land or sea. Then, at last, after a world of
                        anticipation, came her first installment of one hundred and fifty
                        dollars.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-511" n="505"/>
                    <p>It was paid to her in greenbacksthree twenties, six tens, and six fives. Thus
                        collected it made a very convenient roll. It was accompanied by a smile and
                        a salutation from the cashier who paid it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; said the latter, when she applied;
                        &quot;Miss Madendaone hundred and fifty dollars. Quite a success the
                        show seems to have made.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; returned Carrie.</p>
                    <p>Right after came one of the insignificant members of the company, and she
                        heard the changed tone of address.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much?&quot; said the same cashier, sharply. One, such as
                        she had only recently been, was waiting for her modest salary. It took her
                        back to the few weeks in which she had collectedor rather had receivedalmost
                        with the air of a domestic, four-fifty per week from a lordly foreman in a
                        shoe factorya man who, in distributing the envelopes, had the manner of a
                        prince doling out favours to a servile group of petitioners. She knew that
                        out in Chicago this very day the same factory chamber was full of poor
                        homely-clad girls working in long lines at clattering machines; that at noon
                        they would eat a miserable lunch in a half-hour; that Saturday they would
                        gather, as they had when she was one of them, and accept the small pay for
                        work a hundred times harder than she was now doing. Oh, it was so easy now!
                        The world was so rosy and bright. She felt so thrilled that she must needs
                        walk back to the hotel to think, wondering what she should do.</p>
                    <p>It does not take money long to make plain its impotence, providing the
                        desires are in the realm of affection. With her one hundred and fifty in
                        hand, Carrie could think of nothing particularly to do. In itself, as a
                        tangible, apparent thing which she could touch and <pb id="VAA2423-512"
                            n="506"/> look upon, it was a diverting thing for a few days, but this
                        soon passed. Her hotel bill did not require its use. Her clothes had for
                        some time been wholly satisfactory. Another day or two and she would receive
                        another hundred and fifty. It began to appear as if this were not so
                        startlingly necessary to maintain her present state. If she wanted to do
                        anything better or move higher she must have morea great deal more.</p>
                    <p>Now a critic called to get up one of those tinsel interviews which shine with
                        clever observations, show up the wit of critics, display the folly of
                        celebrities, and divert the public. He liked Carrie, and said so,
                        publiclyadding, however, that she was merely pretty, good-natured, and
                        lucky. This cut like a knife. The &quot;Herald,&quot; getting up an
                        entertainment for the benefit of its free ice fund, did her the honour to
                        beg her to appear along with celebrities for nothing. She was visited by a
                        young author, who had a play which he thought she could produce. Alas, she
                        could not judge. It hurt her to think it. Then she found she must put her
                        money in the bank for safety, and so moving, finally reached the place where
                        it struck her that the door to life&apos;s perfect enjoyment was not
                        open.</p>
                    <p>Gradually she began to think it was because it was summer. Nothing was going
                        on much save such entertainments as the one in which she was star. Fifth
                        Avenue was boarded up where the rich had deserted their mansions. Madison
                        Avenue was little better. Broadway was full of loafing thespians in search
                        of next season engagements. The whole city was quiet and her nights were
                        taken up with her work. Hence the feeling that there was little to do.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she said to Lola one day, sitting
                        at one of the windows which looked down into Broad-way, &quot;I get
                        lonely; don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-513" n="507"/>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Lola, &quot;not very often. You
                        won&apos;t go anywhere. That&apos;s what&apos;s the matter with
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where can I go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, there&apos;re lots of places,&quot; returned Lola, who
                        was thinking of her own lightsome tourneys with the gay youths.
                        &quot;You won&apos;t go with anybody.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to go with these people who write to me. I
                        know what kind they are.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You oughtn&apos;t to be lonely,&quot; said Lola, thinking
                        of Carrie&apos;s success. &quot;There&apos;re lots would give
                        their ears to be in your shoes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked out again at the passing crowd.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>Unconsciously her idle hands were beginning to weary</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">CURIOUS SHIFTS OF THE POOR</head>
                    <p>The gloomy Hurstwood, sitting in his cheap hotel, where he had taken refuge
                        with seventy dollarsthe price of his furniturebetween him and nothing, saw a
                        hot summer out and a cool fall in, reading. He was not wholly indifferent to
                        the fact that his money was slipping away. As fifty cents after fifty cents
                        were paid out for a day&apos;s lodging he became uneasy, and finally
                        took a cheaper roomthirty-five cents a dayto make his money last longer.
                        Frequently he saw notices of Carrie. Her picture was in the
                        &quot;World&quot; once or twice, and an old
                        &quot;Herald&quot; he found in a chair informed him that she had
                        recently appeared with some others at a benefit for something or other. He
                        read these things with mingled feelings. Each one seemed to put her farther
                        and farther away into a realm which became more imposing as it receded from
                        him. On the bill-boards, too, he saw a pretty poster, showing her as the
                        Quaker Maid, demure and dainty. More than once he stopped and looked at
                        these, gazing at the pretty face in a sullen sort of way. His clothes were
                        shabby, and he presented a marked contrast to all that she now seemed to
                        be.</p>
                    <p>Somehow, so long as he knew she was at the Casino, thought he had never any
                        intention of going near her, there was a sub-conscious comfort for him was
                        not quite alone. The show seemed such a fixture that, after a month or two,
                        he began to take it for granted that it <pb id="VAA2423-515" n="509"/> was
                        still running. In September it went on the road and he did not notice it.
                        When all but twenty dollars and he did not notice it. When all but twenty
                        dollars of his money was gone, he moved to a fifteen-cent lodging-house in
                        the Bowery, where there was a bare lounging-room filled with tables and
                        benches as well as some chairs. Here his preference was to close his eyes
                        and dream of other days, a habit which grew upon him. It was not sleep at
                        first, but a mental hearkening back to scenes and incidents in his Chicago
                        life. As the present became darker, the past grew brighter, and all that
                        concerned it stood in relief.</p>
                    <p>He was unconscious of just how much this habit had hold of him until one day
                        he found his lips repeating an old answer he had made to one of his friends.
                        They were in Fitzgerald and Moy&apos;s. It was as if he stood in the
                        door of his elegant little office, comfortably dressed, talking to Sagar
                        Morrison about the value of South Chicago real estate in which the latter
                        was about to invest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How would you like to come in on that with me?&quot; he heard
                        Morrison say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not me,&quot; he answered, just as he had years before.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have my hands full now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The movement of his lips aroused him. He wondered whether he had really
                        spoken. The next time he noticed anything of the sort he really did
                        talk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you jump, you bloody fool?&quot; he was
                        saying. &quot;Jump!&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was a funny English story he was telling to a company of actors. Even as
                        his voice recalled him, he was smiling. A crusty old codger, sitting near
                        by, seemed disturbed; at least, he stared in a most pointed way. Hurstwood
                        straightened up. The humour of the memory fled in an instant and he felt
                        ashamed. For relief, he left his chair and strolled out into the
                        streets.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-516" n="510"/>
                    <p>One day, looking down the ad. columns of the &quot;Evening
                        World,&quot; he saw where a new play was at the Casino. Instantly, he
                        came to a mental halt. Carrie had gone! He remembered seeing a poster of her
                        only yesterday, but no doubt it was one left uncovered by the new signs.
                        Curiously, this fact shook him up. He had almost to admit that somehow he
                        was depending upon her being in the city. Now she was gone. He wondered how
                        this important fact had skipped him. Goodness knows when she would be back
                        now. Impelled by a nervous fear, he rose and went into the dingy hall, where
                        he counted his remaining money, unseen. There were but ten dollars in
                        all.</p>
                    <p>He wondered how all these other lodging-house people around him got along.
                        They didn&apos;t seem to do anything. Perhaps they beggedunquestionably
                        they did. Many was the dime he had given to such as they in his day. He had
                        seen other men asking for money on the streets. Maybe he could get some that
                        way. There was horror in this thought.</p>
                    <p>Sitting in the lodging-house room, he came to his last fifty cents. He had
                        saved and counted until his health was affected. His stoutness had gone.
                        With it, even the semblance of a fit in his clothes. Now he decided he must
                        do something, and, walking about, saw another day go by, bringing him down
                        to his last twenty centsnot enough to eat for the morrow.</p>
                    <p>Summoning all his courage, he crossed to Broadway and up to the Broadway
                        Central hotel. Within a block he halted, undecided. A big, heavy-faced
                        porter was standing at one of the side entrances, looking out. Hurstwood
                        purposed to appeal to him. Walking straight up, he was upon him before he
                        could turn away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My friend,&quot; he said, recognising even in his plight <pb
                            id="VAA2423-517" n="511"/> the man&apos;s inferiority, &quot;is
                        there anything about this hotel that I could get to do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The porter stared at him the while he continued to talk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m out of work andout of money and I&apos;ve got to
                        get somethingit dosen&apos;t matter what. I don&apos;t care to talk
                        about what I&apos;ve been, but if you&apos;d tell me how to get
                        something to do, I&apos;d be much obliged to you. It wouldn&apos;t
                        matter if it only lasted a few days just now. I&apos;ve got to have
                        something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The porter still gazed, trying to look indifferent.</p>
                    <p>Then, seeing that Hurstwood was about to go on, he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve nothing to do with it. You&apos;ll have to ask
                        inside.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Curiously, this stirred Hurstwood to further effort.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you might tell me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The fellow shook his head irritably.</p>
                    <p>Inside went the ex-manager and straight to an office off the clerk&apos;s
                        desk. One of the managers of the hotel happened to be there. Hurstwood
                        looked him straight in the eye.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Could you give me something to do for a few days?&quot; he
                        said. &quot;I&apos;m in a position where I have to get something at
                        once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The comfortable manager looked at him, as much as to say: &quot;Well, I
                        should judge so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I came here,&quot; explained Hurstwood, nervously,
                        &quot;because I&apos;ve been a manager myself in my day.
                        I&apos;ve had bad luck in a way, but I&apos;m not here to tell you
                        that. I want something to do, if only for a week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The man imagined he saw a feverish gleam in the applicant&apos;s eye.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What hotel did you manage?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-518" n="512"/>
                    <p>&quot;It wasn&apos;t a hotel,&quot; said Hurstwood. &quot;I
                        was manager of Fitzgerald and Moy&apos;s place in Chicago for fifteen
                        years.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that so?&quot; said the hotel man. &quot;How did you
                        come to get out of that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The figure of Hurstwood was rather surprising in contrast to the fact.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, by foolishness of my own. It isn&apos;t anything to talk
                        about now You could find out if you wanted to. I&apos;m
                        &apos;broke&apos; now and, if you will believe me, I
                        haven&apos;t eaten anything to-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The hotel man was slightly interested in this story. He could hardly tell
                        what to do with such a figure, and yet Hurstwood&apos;s earnestness made
                        him wish to do something.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Call Olsen,&quot; he said, turning to the clerk.</p>
                    <p>In reply to a bell and a disappearing hall-boy, Olsen, the head porter,
                        appeared.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Olsen,&quot; said the manager, &quot;is there anything
                        down-stairs you could find for this man to do? I&apos;d like to give him
                        something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know, sir,&quot; said Olsen. &quot;We have
                        about all the help we need. I think I could find something, sir, though, if
                        you like.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do. Take him to the kitchen and tell Wilson to give him something
                        to eat.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right, sir,&quot; said Olsen.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood followed. Out of the manager&apos;s sight, the head
                        porter&apos;s manner changed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know what the devil there is to do,&quot; hem
                        observed.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood said nothing. To him the big trunk hustler was a subject for
                        private contempt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re to give this man something to eat,&quot; he
                        observed to the cook.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-519" n="513"/>
                    <p>The latter looked Hurstwood over, and seeing something keen and intellectual
                        in his eyes, said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, sit down over there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Thus was Hurstwood installed in the Broadway Centtral, but not for long. He
                        was in no shape or mood do the scrub work that exists about the foundation
                        of every hotel. Nothing better offering, he was set to aid the fireman, to
                        work about the basement, to do any thing and everything that might offer.
                        Porters, cooks, firemen, clerksall were over him. Moreover his appearance
                        did not please these individualshis temper was too lonelyand they made it
                        disagreeable for him.</p>
                    <p>With the stolidity and indifference of despair, however, he endured it all,
                        sleeping in an attic at the roof of the house, eating what the cook gave
                        him, accepting a few dollars a week, which he tried to save. His
                        constitution was in no shape to endure.</p>
                    <p>One day the following February he was sent on an errand to a large coal
                        company&apos;s office. It had been snowing and thawing and the streets
                        were sloppy. He soaked his shoes in his progress and came back feeling dull
                        and weary. All the next day he felt unusually depressed and sat about as
                        much as possible, to the irritation of those who admired energy in
                        others.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon some boxes were to be moved to make room for new culinary
                        supplies. He was ordered to handle a truck. Encountering a big box, he could
                        not lift it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter there?&quot; said the head
                        porter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t you handle it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was straining hard to lift it, but now he quit.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, weakly.</p>
                    <p>The man looked at him and saw that he was deathly pale.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not sick, are you? &quot;he asked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-520" n="514"/>
                    <p>&quot;I think I am,&quot; returned Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you&apos;d better go sit down, then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This he did, but soon grew rapidly worse. It seemed all he could do to crawl
                        to his room, where he remained for a day.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That man Wheeler&apos;s sick,&quot; reported one of the
                        lackeys to the night clerk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter with him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. He&apos;s got a high
                        fever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The hotel physician looked at him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better send him to Bellevue,&quot; he recommended.
                        &quot;He&apos;s got pneumonia.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, he was carted away.</p>
                    <p>In three weeks the worst was over, but it was nearly the first of May before
                        his strength permitted him to be turned out. Then he was discharged.</p>
                    <p>No more weakly looking object ever strolled out into the spring sunshine than
                        the once hale, lusty manager. All his corpulency had fled. His face was thin
                        and pale, his hands white, his body flabby. Clothes and all, he weighed but
                        one hundred and thirty-five pounds. Some old garments had been given hima
                        cheap brown coat and misfit pair of trousers. Also some change and advice.
                        He was told to apply to the charities.</p>
                    <p>Again he resorted to the Bowery lodging-house, brooding over where to look.
                        From this it was but a step to beggary.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What can a man do?&quot; he said. &quot;I can&apos; t
                        starve.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His first application was in sunny Second Avenue. A well-dressed man came
                        leisurely strolling toward him out of Stuyvesant Park. Hurstwood nerved him
                        self and sidled near.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would you mind giving me ten cents?&quot; he said, directly.
                        &quot;I&apos;m in a position where I must ask someone,&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-521" n="515"/>
                    <p>The man scarcely looked at him, but fished in his vest pocket and took out a
                        dime.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There you are,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Much obliged,&quot; said Hurstwood, softly, but the other paid
                        no more attention to him.</p>
                    <p>Satisfied with his success and yet ashamed of his situation, he decided that
                        he would only ask for twenty-five cents more, since that would be
                        sufficient. He strolled about sizing up people, but it was long before just
                        the right face and situation arrived. When he asked, he was refused. Shocked
                        by this result, he took an hour to recover and then asked again. This time a
                        nickel was given him. By the most watchful effort he did get twenty cents
                        more, but it was painful.</p>
                    <p>The next day he resorted to the same effort, experiencing a variety of
                        rebuffs and one or two generous receptions. At last it crossed his mind that
                        there was a science of faces, and that a man could pick the liberal
                        countenance if he tried</p>
                    <p>It was no pleasure to him, however, this stopping of passers-by. He saw one
                        man taken up for it and now troubled lest he should be arrested.
                        Nevertheless, he went on, vaguely anticipating that indefinite something
                        which is always better.</p>
                    <p>It was with a sense of satisfaction, then, that he saw announced one morning
                        the return of the Casino Company, &quot;with Miss Carrie
                        Madenda.&quot; He had thought of her often enough in days past. How
                        successful she washow mush money she must have! Even now, however, it took a
                        severe run of ill-luck to decide him to appeal to her. He was truly hungry
                        before he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll ask her. She won&apos;t refuse me a few
                        dollars.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, he headed for the Casino one afternoon, passing it several times
                        in an effort to locate the stage <pb id="VAA2423-522" n="516"/> entrance.
                        Then he sat in Bryant Park, a block away, waiting. &quot;She
                        can&apos;t refuse to help me a little,&quot; he kept saying to
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>Beginning with half-past six, he hovered like a shadow about the Thirty-ninth
                        Street entrance, pretending always to be a hurrying pedestrian and yet
                        fearful lest he should miss his object. He was slightly nervous, too, now
                        that the eventful hour had arrived; but being weak and hungry, his ability
                        to suffer was modified. At last he saw that the actors were beginning to
                        arrive, and his nervous tension increased, until it seemed as if he could
                        not stand stand much more.</p>
                    <p>Once he thought he saw Carrie coming and moved forward, only to see that he
                        was mistaken.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She can&apos;t be long, now,&quot; he said to himself, half
                        fearing to encounter her and equally depressed at the thought that she might
                        have gone in by another way. His stomach was so empty that it ached.</p>
                    <p>Individual after individual passed him, nearly all well dressed, almost all
                        indifferent. He saw coaches rolling by, gentlemen passing with ladiesthe
                        evening&apos;s merriment was beginning in this region of theatres and
                        hotels.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly a coach rolled up and the driver jumped down to open the door.
                        Before Hurstwood could act, two ladies flounced across the broad walk and
                        disappeared in the stage door. He thought he saw Carrie, but it was so
                        unexpected, so elegant and far away, he could hardly tell. He waited a while
                        longer, growing feverish with want, and then seeing that the stage door no
                        longer opened, and that a merry audience was arriving, he concluded it must
                        have been Carrie and turned away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lord,&quot; he said, hastening out of the street into which the
                        more fortunate were pouring, &quot;I&apos;ve got to get
                        something.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-523" n="517"/>
                    <p>At that hour, when Broadway is wont to assume its most interesting aspect, a
                        peculiar individual invariably took his stand at the corner of Twenty-sixth
                        Street and Broadwaya spot which is also intersected by Fifth Avenue. This
                        was the hour when the theatres were just beginning to receive their patrons.
                        Fire signs announcing the night&apos;s amusements blazed on every hand.
                        Cabs and carriages, their lamps gleaming like yellow eyes, pattered by.
                        Couples and parties of three and four freely mingled in the common crowd,
                        which poured by in a thick stream, laughing and jesting. On Fifth Avenue
                        were loungersa few wealthy strollers, a gentleman in evening dress with his
                        lady on his arm, some clubmen passing from one smoking-room to another.
                        Across the way the great hotels showed a hundred gleaming windows, their
                        cafs and billiard-rooms filled with a comfortable, well-dressed, and
                        pleasure-loving throng. All about was the night, pulsating with the thoughts
                        of pleasure and exhilarationthe curious enthusiasm of a great city bent upon
                        finding joy in a thousand different ways.</p>
                    <p>This unique individual was no less than an ex-soldier turned religionist,
                        who, having suffered the whips and privations of our peculiar social system,
                        had concluded that his duty to the God which he conceived lay in aiding his
                        fellow-man. The form of aid which he chose to administer was entirely
                        original with himself. It consisted of securing a bed for all such homeless
                        wayfarers as should apply to him at this particular spot, though he had
                        scarcely the wherewithal to provide a comfortable habitation for
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>Taking his place amid this lightsome atmosphere, he would stand, his stocky
                        figure cloaked in a great cape overcoat, his head protected by a broad
                        slouch hat, awaiting the applicants who had in various ways <pb
                            id="VAA2423-524" n="518"/> learned the nature of his charity. For a
                        while he would stand alone, gazing like any idler upon an ever-fascinating
                        scene. On the evening in question, a policeman passing saluted him as
                        &quot;captain,&quot; in a friendly way. An urchin who had frequently
                        seen him before, stopped to gaze. All others took him for nothing out of the
                        ordinary, save in the matter of dress, and conceived of him as a stranger
                        whistling and idling for his own amusement.</p>
                    <p>As the first half-hour waned, certain characters appeared. Here and there in
                        the passing crowds one might see, now and then, a loiterer edging
                        interestedly near. A slouchy figure crossed the opposite corner and glanced
                        furtively in his direction. Another came down Fifth Avenue to the corner of
                        Twenty-sixth Street, took a general survey, and hobbled off again. Two or
                        three noticeable Bowery types edged along the Fifth Avenue side of Madison
                        Square, but did not venture over. The soldier, in his cape overcoat, walked
                        a short line of ten feet at his corner, to and fro, indifferently
                        whistling.</p>
                    <p>As nine o&apos;clock approached, some of the hubbub of the earlier hour
                        passed. The atmosphere of the hotels was not so youthful. The air, too, was
                        colder. On every hand curious figures were movingwatchers and peepers,
                        without an imaginary circle, which they seemed afraid to entera dozen in
                        all. Presently, with the arrival of a keener sense of cold, one figure came
                        forward. It crossed Broadway from out the shadow of Twenty-sixth Street,
                        and, in a halting, circuitous way, arrived close to the waiting figure.
                        There was something shamefaced or diffident about the movement, as if the
                        intention were to conceal any idea of stopping until the very last moment.
                        Then suddenly, close to the soldier, came the halt.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-525" n="519"/>
                    <p>The captain looked in recongnition, byt there was no eapecial greeting. The
                        newcomer nodded slightly and murmured something like one who waits for
                        gifts. The other simply motioned toward the edge of the walk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stand over there,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>By this the spell was broken. Even while the soldier resumed his short,
                        solemn walk, other figures shuffled forward. They did not so much as greet
                        the leader, but joined the one, sniffling and hitching and scraping their
                        feet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cold, ain&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m glad winter&apos;s over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Looks as though it might rain.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The motley company had increased to ten. One or two knew each other and
                        conversed. Others stood off a few feet, not wishing to be in the crowd and
                        yet not counted out. They were peevish, crusty, silent, eying nothing in
                        particular and moving their feet.</p>
                    <p>There would have been talking soon, but the soldier gave them no chance.
                        Counting sufficient to begin, he came forward.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Beds, eh, all of you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a general shuffle and murmur of approval.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, line up here. I&apos;ll see what I can do. I
                        haven&apos;t a cent myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They fell into a sort of broken, ragged line. One might see, now, some of the
                        chief characteristics by contrast. There was a wooden leg in the line. Hats
                        were all drooping, a group that would ill become a second-hand Hester Street
                        basement collection. Trousers were all warped and frayed at the bottom and
                        coats worn and faded. In the glare of the store lights, some of the faces
                        looked dry and chalky; others were red with blotches and puffed in the
                        cheeks and under the eyes; one or two were rawboned and reminded <pb
                            id="VAA2423-526" n="520"/> one of railroad hands. A few spectators came
                        near, drawn by the seemingly conferring group, then more and more, and
                        quickly there was a pushing, gaping crowd. Some one in the line began to
                        talk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Silence!&quot; exclaimed the captain. &quot;Now, then,
                        gentlemen, these men are without beds. They have to have some place to sleep
                        to-night. They can&apos;t lie out in the streets. I need twelve cents to
                        put one of them to bed. Who will give it to me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>No reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we&apos;ll have to wait here, boys, until some one does.
                        Twelve cents isn&apos;t so very much for one man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here&apos;s fifteen,&quot; exclaimed a young man, peering
                        forward with strained eyes. &quot;It&apos;s all I can
                        afford.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right. Now I have fifteen. Step out of the line,&quot; and
                        seizing one by the shoulder, the captain marched him off a little way and
                        stood him up alone.</p>
                    <p>Coming back, he resumed his place and began again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have three cents left. These men must be put to bed somehow.
                        There are &quot;counting&quot; one, two, three, four, five, six,
                        seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve men. Nine cents more will put the
                        next man to bed; give him a good, comfortable bed for the night. I go right
                        along and look after that myself. Who will give me nine cents?&quot;</p>
                    <p>One of the watchers, this time a middle-aged man, handed him a five-cent
                        piece.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, I have eight cents. Four more will give this man a bed. Come,
                        gentlemen. We are going very slow this evening. You all have good beds. How
                        about these?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here you are,&quot; remarked a bystander, putting a coin into
                        his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That,&quot; said the captain, looking at the coin,
                        &quot;pays <pb id="VAA2423-527" n="521"/> for two beds for two men and
                        gives me five on the next one. Who will give me seven cents
                        more?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will,&quot; said a voice.</p>
                    <p>Coming down Sixth Avenue this evening, Hurstwood chanced to cross east
                        through Twenty-sixth Street toward Third Avenue. He was wholly disconsolate
                        in spirit, hungry to what he deemed an almost mortal extent, weary, and
                        defeated. How should he get at Carrie now? It would be eleven before the
                        show was over. If she came in a coach, she would go away in one. He would
                        need to interrupt under most trying circumstances. Worst of all, he was
                        hungry and weary, and at best a whole day must intervene, for he had not
                        heart to try again to-night. He had no food and no bed.</p>
                    <p>When he neared Broadway, he noticed the captain&apos;s gathering of
                        wanderers, but thinking it to be the result of a street preacher or some
                        patent medicine fakir, was about to pass on. However, in crossing the street
                        toward Madison Square Park, he noticed the line of men whose beds were
                        already secured, stretching out from the main body of the crowd. In the
                        glare of the neighbouring electric light he recognised a type of his own
                        kindthe figures whom he saw about the streets and in the lodging-houses,
                        drifting in mind and body like himself. He wondered what it could be and
                        turned back.</p>
                    <p>There was the captain curtly pleading as before. He heard with astonishment
                        and a sense of relief the oft-repeated words: &quot;These men must have
                        a bed.&quot; Before him was the line of unfortunates whose beds were yet
                        to be had, and seeing a newcomer quietly edge up and take a position at the
                        end of the line, he decided to do likewise. What use to contend? He was
                        weary to-night. It was a simple way out of one <pb id="VAA2423-528" n="522"
                        /> difficulty, at least. To-morrow, maybe, he would do better.</p>
                    <p>Back of him, where some of those were whose beds were safe, a relaxed air was
                        apparent. The strain of uncertainty being removed, he heard them talking
                        with moderate freedom and some leaning toward sociability. Politics,
                        religion, the state of the government, some newspaper sensations, and the
                        more notorious facts the world over, found mouthpieces and auditors there.
                        Cracked and husky voices pronounced forcibly upon odd matters. Vague and
                        rambling observations were made in reply.</p>
                    <p>There were squints, and leers, and some dull, oxlike stares from those who
                        were too dull or too weary to converse.</p>
                    <p>Standing tells. Hurstwood became more weary waiting. He thought he should
                        drop soon and shifted restlessly from one foot to the other. At last his
                        turn came. The man ahead had been paid for and gone to the blessed line of
                        success. He was now first, and already the captain was talking for him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Twelve cents, gentlementwelve cents puts this man to bed. He
                        wouldn&apos;t stand here in the cold if he had any place to
                        go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood swallowed something that rose to his throat. Hunger and weakness
                        had made a coward of him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here you are,&quot; said a stranger, handing money to the
                        captain.</p>
                    <p>Now the latter put a kindly hand on the ex-manager&apos;s shoulder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Line up over there,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Once there, Hurstwood breathed easier. He felt as if the world were not quite
                        so bad with such a good man in it. Others seemed to feel like himself about
                        this.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-529" n="523"/>
                    <p>&quot;Captain&apos;s a great feller, ain&apos;t he?&quot;
                        said the man aheada little, woe-begone, helpless-looking sort of individual,
                        who looked as though he had ever been the sport and care of fortune.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hurstwood, indifferently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Huh! there&apos;s a lot back there yet,&quot; said a man
                        farther up, leaning out and looking back at the applicants for whom the
                        captain was pleading.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. Most be over a hundred to-night,&quot; said another.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look at the guy in the cab,&quot; observed a third.</p>
                    <p>A cab had stopped. Some gentleman in evening dress reached out a bill to the
                        captain, who took it with simple thanks and turned away to his line. There
                        was a general craning of necks as the jewel in the white shirt front
                        sparkled and the cab moved off. Even the crowd gaped in awe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That fixes up nine men for the night,&quot; said the captain,
                        counting out as many of the line near him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Line up over there. Now, then, there are only seven. I need twelve
                        cents.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Money came slowly. In the course of time the crowd thinned out to a meagre
                        handful. Fifth Avenue, save for an occasional cab or foot passenger, was
                        bare. Broadway was thinly peopled with pedestrians. Only now and then a
                        stranger passing noticed the small group, handed out a coin, and went away,
                        unheeding.</p>
                    <p>The captain remained stolid and determined. He talked on, very slowly,
                        uttering the fewest words and with a certain assurance, as though he could
                        not fail.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come; I can&apos;t stay out here all night. These men are
                        getting tired and cold. Some one give me four cents.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There came a time when he said nothing at all. Money was handed him, and for
                        each twelve cents he singled out a man and put him in the other line. Then
                            <pb id="VAA2423-530" n="524"/> he walked up and down as before, looking
                        at the ground.</p>
                    <p>The theatres let out. Fire signs disappeared. A clock struck eleven. Another
                        half-hour and he was down to the last two men.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come, now,&quot; he exclaimed to several curious observers;
                        &quot;eighteen cents will fix us all up for the night. Eighteen cents. I
                        have six. Somebody give me the money. Remember, I have to go over to
                        Brooklyn yet to-night. Before that I have to take these men down and put
                        them to bed. Eighteen cents.&quot;</p>
                    <p>No one responded. He walked to and fro, looking down for several minutes,
                        occasionally saying softly: &quot;Eighteen cents.&quot; It seemed as
                        if this paltry sum would delay the desired culmination longer than all the
                        rest had. Hurstwood, buoyed up slightly by the long line of which he was a
                        part, refrained with an effort from groaning, he was so weak.</p>
                    <p>At last a lady in opera cape and rustling skirts came down Fifth Avenue,
                        accompanied by her escort. Hurstwood gazed wearily, reminded by her both of
                        Carrie in her new world and of the time when he had escorted his own wife in
                        like manner.</p>
                    <p>While he was gazing, she turned and, looking at the remarkable company, sent
                        her escort over. He came, holding a bill in his fingers, all elegant and
                        graceful.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here you are,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; said the captain, turning to the two remaining
                        applicants. &quot;Now we have some for to-morrow night,&quot; he
                        added.</p>
                    <p>Therewith he lined up the last two and proceeded to the head, counting as he
                        went.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One hundred and thirty-seven,&quot; he announced.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, boys, line up. Right dress there. We won&apos;t be much
                        longer about this. Steady, now.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-531" n="525"/>
                    <p>He placed himself at the head and called out &quot;Forward.&quot;
                        Hurstwood moved with the line. Across Fifth Avenue, through Madison Square
                        by the winding paths, east on Twenty-third Street, and down Third Avenue
                        wound the long, serpentine company. Mid-night pedestrians and loiterers
                        stopped and stared as the company passed. Chatting policemen, at various
                        corners, stared indifferently or nodded to the leader, whom they had seen
                        before. On Third Avenue they marched, a seemingly weary way, to Eighth
                        Street, where there was a lodging-house, closed, apparently, for the night.
                        They were expected, however.</p>
                    <p>Outside in the gloom they stood, while the leader parleyed within. Then doors
                        swung open and they were invited in with a &quot;Steady,
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Some one was at the head showing rooms, so that there was no delay for keys.
                        Toiling up the creaky stairs, Hurstwood looked back and saw the captain,
                        watching; the last one of the line being included in his broad solicitude.
                        Then he gathered his cloak about him and strolled out into the night.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t stand much of this,&quot; said Hurstwood,
                        whose legs ached him painfully, as he sat down upon the miserable bunk in
                        the small, lightless chamber allotted to him. &quot;I&apos;ve got to
                        eat, or I&apos;ll die.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Playing in New York one evening on this her return, Carrie was putting the
                        finishing touches to her toilet before leaving for the night, when a
                        commotion near the stage door caught her ear. It included a familiar
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind, now. I want to see Miss Madenda.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll have to send in your card.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, come off! Here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A half-dollar was passed over, and now a knock came at her dressing-room
                        door.</p>
                    <p>Carrie opened it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, well!&quot; said Drouet. &quot;I do swear! Why, how
                        are you? I knew that was you the moment I saw you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie fell back a pace, expecting a most embarrassing conversation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aren&apos;t you going to shake hands with me? Well,
                        you&apos;re a dandy! That&apos;s all right, shake hands.</p>
                    <p>Carrie put out her hand, smiling, if for nothing more than the man&apos;s
                        exuberant good-nature. Though older, he was but slightly changed. The same
                        fine clothes, the same stocky body, the same rosy countenance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That fellow at the door there didn&apos;t want to let me in,
                        until I paid him. I knew it was you, all right. Say, you&apos;ve got a
                        great show. You do your part fine. I knew you would I just happened to be
                        passing tonight and thought I&apos;d drop in for a few minutes. I saw
                            <pb id="VAA2423-533" n="527"/> your name on the programme, but I
                        didn&apos;t remember it until you came on the stage. Then it struck me
                        all at once. Say, you could have knocked use down with a feather.
                        That&apos;s the same name you used out there in Chicago, isn&apos;t
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Carrie, mildly, overwhelmed by the
                        man&apos;s assurance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I knew it was, the moment I saw you. Well, how have you been,
                        anyhow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, very well,&quot; said Carrie, lingering in her
                        dressing-room. She was rather dazed by the assault. &quot;How have you
                        been?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Me? Oh, fine. I&apos;m here now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that so?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. I&apos;ve been here for six months. I&apos;ve got
                        charge of a branch here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How nice!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, when did you go on the stage, anyhow?&quot; inquired
                        Drouet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;About three years ago,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t say so! Well, sir, this is the first
                        I&apos;ve heard of it. I knew you would, though. I always said you could
                        actdidn&apos;t I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you did,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you do look great,&quot; he said. &quot;I never saw
                        anybody improve so. You&apos;re taller, aren&apos;t
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Me? Oh, a little, maybe.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He gazed at her dress, then at her hair, where a becoming hat was set
                        jauntily, then into her eyes, which she took all occasion to avert.
                        Evidently he expected to restore their old friendship at once and without
                        modification.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, seeing her gather up her purse,
                        handkerchief, and the like, preparatory to departing,</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-534" n="528"/>
                    <p>&quot;I want you to come out to dinner with me; won&apos;t you?
                        I&apos;ve got a friend out here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I can&apos;t,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;Not
                        to-night. I have an early engagement to-morrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw, let the engagement go. Come on. I can get rid of him. I want to
                        have a good talk with you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no,&quot; said Carrie; &quot;I can&apos;t. You
                        mustn&apos;t ask me any more. I don&apos;t care for a late
                        dinner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, come on and have a talk, then, anyhow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not to-night,&quot; she said, shaking her head.
                        &quot;We&apos;ll have a talk some other time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As a result of this, she noticed a shade of thought pass over his face, as if
                        he were beginning to realise that things were changed. Good-nature dictated
                        something better than this for one who had always liked her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You come around to the hotel to-morrow,&quot; she said, as sort
                        of penance for error. &quot;You can take dinner with me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Drouet, brightening. &quot;Where are
                        you stopping?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;At the Waldorf,&quot; she answered, mentioning the fashionable
                        hostelry then but newly erected.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What time?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, come at three,&quot; said Carrie, pleasantly.</p>
                    <p>The next day Drouet called, but it was with no especial delight that Carrie
                        remembered her appointment. However, seeing him, handsome as ever, after his
                        kind, and most genially disposed, her doubts as to whether the dinner would
                        be disagreeable were swept away. He talked as volubly as ever.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They put on a lot of lugs here, don&apos;t they?&quot; was
                        his first remark.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; they do,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>Genial egotist that he was, he went at once into a detailed account of his
                        own career.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-535" n="529"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going to have a business of my own pretty
                        soon,&quot; he observed in one place. &quot;I can get backing for
                        two hundred thousand dollars.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie listened most good-naturedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say,&quot; he said, suddenly; &quot;where is Hurstwood
                        now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie flushed a little.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s here in New York, I guess,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;I haven&apos;t seen him for some time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drouet mused for a moment. He had not been sure until now that the ex-manager
                        was not an influential figure in the background. He imagined not; but this
                        assurance relieved him. It must be that Carrie had got rid of himas well she
                        ought, he thought.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A man always makes a mistake when he does anything like
                        that,&quot; he observed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Like what?&quot; said Carrie, unwitting of what was coming.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you know,&quot; and Drouet waved her intelligence, as it
                        were, with his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I don&apos;t,&quot; she answered. &quot;What do you
                        mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why that affair in Chicagothe time he left.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know what you are talking about,&quot; said
                        Carrie. Could it be he would refer so rudely to Hurstwood&apos;s flight
                        with her?</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oho!&quot; said Drouet, incredulously. &quot;You knew he
                        took ten thousand dollars with him when he left, didn&apos;t
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What!&quot; said Carrie. &quot;You don&apos;t mean to
                        say he stole money, do you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why,&quot; said Drouet, puzzled at her tone, &quot;you knew
                        that, didn&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, no,&quot; said Carrie. &quot;Of course I
                        didn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s funny,&quot; said Drouet. &quot;He
                        did, you know. It was in all the papers.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-536" n="530"/>
                    <p>&quot;How much did you say he took?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ten thousand dollars. I heard he sent most of it back afterwards,
                        though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked vacantly at the richly carpeted floor. A new light was shining
                        upon all the years since her enforced flight. She remembered now a hundred
                        things that indicated as much. She also imagined that he took it on her
                        account. Instead of hatred springing up there was a kind of sorrow
                        generated. Poor fellow! What a thing to have had hanging over his head all
                        the time.</p>
                    <p>At dinner Drouet, warmed up by eating and drinking and softened in mood,
                        fancied he was winning Carrie to her old-time good-natured regard for him.
                        He began to imagine it would not be so difficult to enter into her life
                        again, high as she was. Ah, what a prize! he thought. How beautiful, how
                        elegant, how famous! In her theatrical and Waldorf setting, Carrie was to
                        him the all-desirable.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you remember how nervous you were that night at the
                        Avery?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>Carrie smiled to think of it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never saw anybody do better than you did then, Cad,&quot; he
                        added ruefully, as he leaned an elbow on the table; &quot;I thought you
                        and I were going to get along fine those days.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t talk that way,&quot; said Carrie, bringing
                        in the least touch of coldness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you let me tell you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she answered, rising. &quot;Besides,
                        it&apos;s time I was getting ready for the theatre. I&apos;ll have
                        to leave you. Come, now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, stay a minute,&quot; pleaded Drouet.
                        &quot;You&apos;ve got plenty of time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Carrie, gently.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-537" n="531"/>
                    <p>Reluctantly Drouet gave up the bright table and followed. He saw her to the
                        elevator and, standing there, said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;When do I see you again?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, some time, possibly,&quot; said Carrie.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll be here all summer. Good-night!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The elevator door was open.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-night!.&quot; said Drouet, as she rustled in.</p>
                    <p>Then he strolled sadly down the hall, all his old longing revived, because
                        she was now so far off. The merry frou-frou of the place spoke all of her.
                        He thought himself hardly dealt with. Carrie, however, had other
                        thoughts.</p>
                    <p>That night it was that she passed Hurstwood, waiting at the Casino, without
                        observing him.</p>
                    <p>The next night, walking to the theatre, she encountered him face to face. He
                        was waiting, more gaunt than ever, determined to see her, if he had to send
                        in word. At first she did not recognise the shabby, baggy figure. He
                        frightened her, edging so close, a seemingly hungry stranger.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Carrie,&quot; he half whispered, &quot;can I have a few
                        words with you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She turned and recognised him on the instant. If there ever had lurked any
                        feeling in her heart against him, it deserted her now. Still, she remembered
                        what Drouet said about his having stolen the money.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, George,&quot; she said; &quot;what&apos;s the
                        matter with you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve been sick,&quot; he answered.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve just got out of the hospital. For God&apos;s
                        sake, let me have a little money, will you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said Carrie, her lip trembling in a strong
                        effort to maintain her composure. &quot;But what&apos;s the matter
                        with you, anyhow?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-538" n="532"/>
                    <p>She was opening her purse, and now pulled out all the bills in ita five and
                        two twos.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve been sick, I told you,&quot; he said, peevishly,
                        almost resenting her excessive pity. It came hard to him to receive it from
                        such a source.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s all I have with
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; he answered, softly. &quot;I&apos;ll
                        give it back to you some day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked at him, while pedestrians stared at her. She felt the strain of
                        publicity. So did Hurstwood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you tell me what&apos;s the matter with
                        you?&quot; she asked, hardly knowing what to do. &quot;Where are you
                        living?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;ve got a room down in the Bowery,&quot; he
                        answered. &quot;There&apos;s no use trying to tell you here.
                        I&apos;m all right now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He seemed in a way to resent her kindly inquiriesso much better had fate
                        dealt with her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better go on in,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m much
                        obliged, but I won&apos;t bother you any more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She tried to answer, but he turned away and shuffled off toward the east.</p>
                    <p>For days this apparition was a drag on her soul before it began to wear
                        partially away. Drouet called again, but now he was not even seen by her.
                        His attentions seemed out of place.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m out,&quot; was her reply to the boy.</p>
                    <p>So peculiar, indeed, was her lonely, self-withdrawing temper, that she was
                        becoming an interesting figure in the public eyeshe was so quiet and
                        reserved.</p>
                    <p>Not long after the management decided to transfer the show to London. A
                        second summer season did not seem to promise well here.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How would you like to try subduing London?&quot; asked her
                        manager, one afternoon.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-539" n="533"/>
                    <p>&quot;It might be just the other way,&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think well go in June,&quot; he answered.</p>
                    <p>In the hurry of departure, Hurstwood was forgotten. Both he and Drouet were
                        left to discover that she was gone. The latter called once, and exclaimed at
                        the news. Then he stood in the lobby, chewing the ends of his moustache. At
                        last he reached a conclusionthe old days had gone for good.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She isn&apos;t so much,&quot; he said; but in his heart of
                        hearts he did not believe this.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood shifted by curious means through a long summer and fall. A small
                        job as janitor of a dance hall helped him for a month. Begging, sometimes
                        going hungry, sometimes sleeping in the park, carried him over more days.
                        Resorting to those peculiar charities, several of which, in the press of
                        hungry search, he accidentally stumbled upon, did the rest. Toward the dead
                        of winter, Carrie came back, appearing on Broadway in a new play; but he was
                        not aware of it. For weeks he wandered about the city, begging, while the
                        fire sign, announcing her engagement, blazed nightly upon the crowded street
                        of amusements. Drouet saw it, but did not venture in.</p>
                    <p>About this time Ames returned to New York. He had made a little success in
                        the West, and now opened a laboratory in Wooster Street. Of course, he
                        encountered Carrie through Mrs. Vance; but there was nothing responsive
                        between them. He thought she was still united to Hurstwood, until otherwise
                        informed. Not knowing the facts then, he did not profess to understand, and
                        refrained from comment.</p>
                    <p>With Mrs. Vance, he saw the new play, and expressed himself accordingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She ought not to be in comedy,&quot; he said. &quot;I think
                        she could do better than that&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-540" n="534"/>
                    <p>One afternoon they met at the Vances&apos; accidentally, and began a very
                        friendly conversation. She could hardly tell why the one-time keen interest
                        in him was no longer with her. Unquestionably, it was because at that time
                        he had represented something which she did not have; but this she did not
                        understand. Success had given her the momentary feeling that she was now
                        blessed with much of which he would approve. As a matter of fact, her little
                        newspaper fame was nothing at all to him. He thought she could have done
                        better, by far.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You didn&apos;t go into comedy-drama, after all?&quot; he
                        said, remembering her interest in that form of art.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she answered; &quot;I haven&apos;t, so
                        far.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her in such a peculiar way that she realised she had failed. It
                        moved her to add: &quot;I want to, though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should think you would,&quot; he said. &quot;You have the
                        sort of disposition that would do well in comedy-drama.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It surprised her that he should speak of disposition. Was she, then, so
                        clearly in his mind?</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I should judge you were rather
                        sympathetic in your nature.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie smiled and coloured slightly. He was so innocently frank with her that
                        she drew nearer in friendship. The old call of the ideal was sounding.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she answered, pleased,
                        nevertheless, beyond all concealment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw your play,&quot; he remarked. &quot;It&apos;s
                        very good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m glad you liked it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very good, indeed,&quot; he said, &quot;for a
                        comedy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This is all that was said at the time, owing to an interruption, but later
                        they met again. He was sitting <pb id="VAA2423-541" n="535"/> in a corner
                        after dinner, staring at the floor, when Carrie came up with another of the
                        guests. Hard work had given his face the look of one who is weary. It was
                        not for Carrie to know the thing in it which appealed to her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All alone?&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was listening to the music.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll be back in a moment,&quot; said her companion,
                        who saw nothing in the inventor.</p>
                    <p>Now he looked up in her face, for she was standing a moment, while he
                        sat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that a pathetic strain?&quot; he inquired,
                        listening.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, very,&quot; she returned, also catching it, now that her
                        attention was called.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sit down,&quot; he added, offering her the chair beside
                        him.</p>
                    <p>They listened a few moments in silence, touched by the same feeling, only
                        hers reached her through the heart. Music still charmed her as in the old
                        days.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know what it is about music,&quot; she started
                        to say, moved by the inexplicable longings which surged within her;
                        &quot;but it always makes me feel as if I wanted
                        somethingI&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied; &quot;I know how you
                        feel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Suddenly he turned to considering the peculiarity of her disposition,
                        expressing her feelings so frankly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ought not to be melancholy,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>He thought a while, and then went off into a seemingly alien observation
                        which, however, accorded with their feelings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The world is full of desirable situations, but, unfortunately, we
                        can occupy but one at a time. It doesn&apos;t do us any good to wring
                        our hands over the far-off things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The music ceased and he arose, taking a standing position before her, as if
                        to rest himself.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-542" n="536"/>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you get into some good, strong
                        comedy-drama?&quot; he said. He was looking directly at her now,
                        studying her face. Her large, sympathetic eyes and pain-touched mouth
                        appealed to him as proofs of his judgment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps I shall,&quot; she returned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s your field,&quot; he added.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said; &quot;I do. I don&apos;t suppose
                        you&apos;re aware of it, but there is something about your eyes and
                        mouth which fits you for that sort of work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie thrilled to be taken so seriously. For the moment, loneliness deserted
                        her. Here was praise which was keen and analytical.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s in your eyes and mouth,&quot; he went on
                        abstractedly. &quot;I remember thinking, the first time I saw you, that
                        there was something peculiar about your mouth. I thought you were about to
                        cry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How odd,&quot; said Carrie, warm with delight. This was what
                        her heart craved.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I noticed that that was your natural look, and to-night I saw
                        it again. There&apos;s a shadow about your eyes, too, which gives your
                        face much this same character. It&apos;s in the depth of them, I
                        think.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie looked straight into his face, wholly aroused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You probably are not aware of it,&quot; he added.</p>
                    <p>She looked away, pleased that he should speak thus, longing to be equal to
                        this feeling written upon her countenance. It unlocked the door to a new
                        desire.</p>
                    <p>She had cause to ponder over this until they met againseveral weeks or more.
                        It showed her she was drifting away from the old ideal which had filled her
                        in the dressing-rooms of the Avery stage and there-after, for a long time.
                        Why had she lost it?</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know why you should be a success,&quot; he said, another <pb
                            id="VAA2423-543" n="537"/> time, &quot;if you had a more dramatic
                        part. I&apos;ve studied it out&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it?&quot; said Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, as one pleased with a puzzle,
                        &quot;the expression in your face is one that comes out in different
                        things. You get the same thing in a pathetic song, or any picture which
                        moves you deeply. It&apos;s a thing the world likes to see, because
                        it&apos;s a natural expression of its longing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie gazed without exactly getting the import of what he meant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The world is always struggling to express itself,&quot; he went
                        on. &quot;Most people are not capable of voicing their feelings. They
                        depend upon others. That is what genius is for. One man expresses their
                        desires for them in music; another one in poetry; another one in a play.
                        Sometimes nature does it in a faceit makes the face representative of all
                        desire. That&apos;s what has happened in your case.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her with so much of the import of the thing in his eyes that she
                        caught it. At least, she got the idea that her look was something which
                        represented the world&apos;s longing. She took it to heart as a
                        creditable thing, until he added:</p>
                    <p>&quot;That puts a burden of duty on you. It so happens that you have this
                        thing. It is no credit to youthat is, I mean, you might not have had it. You
                        paid nothing to get it. But now that you have it, you must do something with
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot; asked Carrie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should say, turn to the dramatic field. You have so much sympathy
                        and such a melodious voice. Make them valuable to others. It will make your
                        powers endure.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie did not understand this last. All the rest <pb id="VAA2423-544"
                            n="538"/> showed her that her comedy success was little or nothing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, just this. You have this quality in your eyes and mouth and in
                        your nature. You can lose it, you know. If you turn away from it and live to
                        satisfy yourself alone, it will go fast enough. The look will leave your
                        eyes. Your mouth will change. Your power to act will disappear. You may
                        think they won&apos;t, but they will. Nature takes care of
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was so interested in forwarding all good causes that he sometimes became
                        enthusiastic, giving vent to these preachments. Something in Carrie appealed
                        to him. He wanted to stir her up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; she said, absently, feeling slightly guilty of
                        neglect.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I were you,&quot; he said, &quot;I&apos;d
                        change.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The effect of this was like roiling helpless waters. Carrie troubled over it
                        in her rocking-chair for days.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t believe I&apos;ll stay in comedy so very much
                        longer,&quot; she eventually remarked to Lola.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, why not?&quot; said the latter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think,&quot; she said, &quot;I can do better in a serious
                        play.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What put that idea in your head?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; she answered; &quot;I&apos;ve always
                        thought so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Still, she did nothinggrieving. It was a long way to this better thingor
                        seemed soand comfort was about her; hence the inactivity and longing.</p>

                    </head>
                    <p>In the city, at that time, there were a number of charities similar in nature
                        to that of the captain&apos;s, which Hurstwood now patronised in a like
                        unfortunate way. One was a convent mission-house of the Sisters of Mercy in
                        Fifteenth Streeta row of red brick family dwellings, before the door of
                        which hung a plain wooden contribution box, on which was painted the
                        statement that every noon a meal was given free to all those who might apply
                        and ask for aid. This simple announcement was modest in the extreme,
                        covering, as it did, a charity so broad. Institutions and charities are so
                        large and so numerous in New York that such things as this are not often
                        noticed by the more comfortably situated. But to one whose mind is upon the
                        matter, they grow exceedingly under inspection. Unless one were looking up
                        this matter in particular, he could have stood at Sixth Avenue and Fifteenth
                        Street for days around the noon hour and never have noticed that out of the
                        vast crowd that surged along that busy thoroughfare there turned out, every
                        few seconds, some weather-beaten, heavy-footed specimen of humanity, gaunt
                        in countenance and dilapidated in the matter of clothes. The fact is none
                        the less true, however, and the colder the day the more apparent it became.
                        Space and a lack of culinary room in the mission-house, compelled an
                        arrangement which permitted <pb id="VAA2423-546" n="540"/> of only
                        twenty-five or thirty eating at one time, so that a line had to be formed
                        outside and an orderly entrance effected. This caused a daily spectacle
                        which, however, had become so common by repetition during a number of years
                        that now nothing was thought of it. The men waited patiently, like cattle,
                        in the coldest weatherwaited for several hours before they could be
                        admitted. No questions were asked and no service rendered. They ate and went
                        away again, some of them returning regularly day after day the winter
                        through.</p>
                    <p>A big, motherly looking woman invariably stood guard at the door during the
                        entire operation and counted the admissible number. The men moved up in
                        solemn order. There was no haste and no eagerness displayed. It was almost a
                        dumb procession. In the bitterest weather this line was to be found here.
                        Under an icy wind there was a prodigious slapping of hands and a dancing of
                        feet. Fingers and the features of the face looked as if severely nipped by
                        the cold. A study of these men in broad light proved them to be nearly all
                        of a type. They belonged to the class that sit on the park benches during
                        the endurable days and sleep upon them during the summer nights. They
                        frequent the Bowery and those down-at-the-heels East Side streets where poor
                        clothes and shrunken features are not singled out as curious. They are the
                        men who are in the lodging-house sitting-rooms during bleak and bitter
                        weather and who swarm about the cheaper shelters which only open at six in a
                        number of the lower East Side streets. Miserable food, ill-timed and
                        greedily eaten, had played havoc with bone and muscle. They were all pale,
                        flabby, sunken-eyed, hollow-chested, with eyes that glinted and shone and
                        lips that were a sickly red by contrast. Their hair was but half attended
                        to, their <pb id="VAA2423-547" n="541"/> ears anmic in hue, and their shoes
                        broken in leather and run down at heel and toe. They were of the class which
                        simply floats and drifts, every wave of people washing up one, as breakers
                        do driftwood upon a stormy shore.</p>
                    <p>For nearly a quarter of a century, in another section of the city,
                        Fleischmann, the baker, had given a loaf of bread to any one who would come
                        for it to the side door of his restaurant at the corner of Broadway and
                        Tenth Street, at midnight. Every night during twenty years about three
                        hundred men had formed in line and at the appointed time marched past the
                        doorway, picked their loaf from a great box placed just outside, and
                        vanished again into the night. From the beginning to the present time there
                        had been little change in the character or number of these men. There were
                        two or three figures that had grown familiar to those who had seen this
                        little procession pass year after year. Two of them had missed scarcely a
                        night in fifteen years. There were about forty, more or less, regular
                        callers. The remainder of the line was formed of strangers. In times of
                        panic and unusual hardships there were seldom more than three hundred. In
                        times of prosperity, when little is heard of the unemployed, there were
                        seldom less. The same number, winter and summer, in storm or calm, in good
                        times and bad, held this melancholy midnight rendezvous at
                        Fleischmann&apos;s bread box.</p>
                    <p>At both of these two charities, during the severe winter which was now on,
                        Hurstwood was a frequent visitor. On one occasion it was peculiarly cold,
                        and finding no comfort in begging about the streets, he waited until noon
                        before seeking this free offering to the poor. Already, at eleven
                        o&apos;clock of this morning, several such as he had shambled forward
                        out of Sixth <pb id="VAA2423-548" n="542"/> Avenue, their thin clothes
                        flapping and fluttering in the wind. They leaned against the iron railing
                        which protects the walls of the Ninth Regiment Armory, which fronts upon
                        that section of Fifteenth Street, having come early in order to be first in.
                        Having an hour to wait, they at first lingered at a respectful distance; but
                        others coming up, they moved closer in order to protect their right of
                        precedence. To this collection Hurstwood came up from the west out of
                        Seventh Avenue and stopped close to the door, nearer than all the others.
                        Those who had been waiting before him, but farther away, now drew near, and
                        by a certain stolidity of demeanour, no words being spoken, indicated that
                        they were first.</p>
                    <p>Seeing the opposition to his action, he looked sullenly along the line, then
                        moved out, taking his place at the foot. When order had been restored, the
                        animal feeling of opposition relaxed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Must be pretty near noon,&quot; ventured one.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is,&quot; said another. &quot;I&apos;ve been waiting
                        nearly an hour.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gee, but it&apos;s cold!&quot;</p>
                    <p>They peered eagerly at the door, where all must enter. A grocery man drove up
                        and carried in several baskets of eatables. This started some words upon
                        grocery men and the cost of food in general.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see meat&apos;s gone up,&quot; said one.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If there wuz war, it would help this country a lot.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The line was growing rapidly. Already there were fifty or more, and those at
                        the head, by their demeanour, evidently congratulated themselves upon not
                        having so long to wait as those at the foot. There was much jerking of
                        heads, and looking down the line.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It don&apos;t matter how near you get to the front, so long as
                        you&apos;re in the first twenty-five,&quot; commented one of the
                        first twenty-five. &quot;You all go in together.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-549" n="543"/>
                    <p>&quot;Humph!&quot; ejaculated Hurstwood, who had been so sturdily
                        displaced.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This here Single Tax is the thing,&quot; said another.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There ain&apos;t going to be no order till it
                        comes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>For the most part there was silence; gaunt men shuffling, glancing, and
                        beating their arms.</p>
                    <p>At last the door opened and the motherly-looking sister appeared. She only
                        looked an order. Slowly the line moved up and, one by one, passed in, until
                        twenty-five were counted. Then she interposed a stout arm, and the line
                        halted, with six men on the steps. Of these the ex-manager was one. Waiting
                        thus, some talked, some ejaculated concerning the misery of it; some
                        brooded, as did Hurstwood. At last he was admitted, and, having eaten, came
                        away, almost angered because of his pains in getting it.</p>
                    <p>At eleven o&apos;clock of another evening, perhaps two weeks later, he
                        was at the midnight offering of a loafwaiting patiently. It had been an
                        unfortunate day with him, but now he took his fate with a touch of
                        philosophy. If he could secure no supper, or was hungry late in the evening,
                        here was a place he could come. A few minutes before twelve, a great box of
                        bread was pushed out, and exactly on the hour a portly, round-faced German
                        took position by it, calling &quot;Ready.&quot; The whole line at
                        once moved forward, each taking his loaf in turn and going his separate way.
                        On this occasion, the ex-manager ate his as he went, plodding the dark
                        streets in silence to his bed.</p>
                    <p>By January he had about concluded that the game was up with him. Life had
                        always seemed a precious thing, but now constant want and weakened vitality
                        had made the charms of earth rather dull and inconspicuous. Several times,
                        when fortune pressed most harshly, he thought he would end his troubles; but
                        with <pb id="VAA2423-550" n="544"/> a change of weather, or the arrival of a
                        quarter or a dime, his mood would change, and he would wait. Each day he
                        would find some old paper lying about and look into it, to see if there was
                        any trace of Carrie, but all summer and fall he had looked in vain. Then he
                        noticed that his eyes were beginning to hurt him, and this ailment rapidly
                        increased until, in the dark chambers of the lodgings he frequented, he did
                        not attempt to read. Bad and irregular eating was weakening every function
                        of his body. The one recourse left him was to doze when a place offered and
                        he could get the money to occupy it.</p>
                    <p>He was beginning to find, in his wretched clothing and meagre state of body,
                        that people took him for a chronic type of bum and beggar. Police hustled
                        him along, restaurant and lodging-house keepers turned him out promptly the
                        moment he had his due; pedestrians waved him off. He found it more and more
                        difficult to get anything from anybody.</p>
                    <p>At last he admitted to himself that the game was up. It was after a long
                        series of appeals to pedestrians, in which he had been refused and
                        refusedevery one hastening from contact.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give me a little something, will you, mister?&quot; he said to
                        the last one. &quot;For God&apos;s sake, do; I&apos;m
                        starving.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw, get out,&quot; said the man, who happened to be a common
                        type himself. &quot;You&apos;re no good. I&apos;ll give you
                        nawthin&apos;.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood put his hands, red from cold, down in his pockets. Tears came into
                        his eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; he said; &quot;I&apos;m no
                        good now. I was all right. I had money. I&apos;m going to quit
                        this,&quot; and, with death in his heart, he started down toward the
                        Bowery. People had turned on the gas before and died; <pb id="VAA2423-551"
                            n="545"/> why shouldn&apos;t he? He remembered a lodging-house where
                        there were little, close rooms, with gas-jets in them, almost pre-arranged,
                        he thought, for what he wanted to do, which rented for fifteen cents. Then
                        he remembered that he had no fifteen cents.</p>
                    <p>On the way he met a comfortable-looking gentleman, coming, clean-shaven, out
                        of a fine barber shop.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would you mind giving me a little something?&quot; he asked
                        this man boldly.</p>
                    <p>The gentleman looked him over and fished for a dime. Nothing but quarters
                        were in his pocket.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here,&quot; he said, handing him one, to be rid of him.
                        &quot;Be off, now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood moved on, wondering. The sight of the large, bright coin pleased
                        him a little. He remembered that he was hungry and that he could get a bed
                        for ten cents. With this, the idea of death passed, for the time being, out
                        of his mind. It was only when he could get nothing but insults that death
                        seemed worth while.</p>
                    <p>One day, in the middle of the winter, the sharpest spell of the season set
                        in. It broke grey and cold in the first day, and on the second snowed. Poor
                        luck pursuing him, he had secured but ten cents by nightfall, and this he
                        had spent for food. At evening he found him-self at the Boulevard and
                        Sixty-seventh Street, where he finally turned his face Bowery-ward.
                        Especially fatigued because of the wandering propensity which had seized him
                        in the morning, he now half dragged his wet feet, shuffling the soles upon
                        the sidewalk. An old, thin coat was turned up about his red earshis cracked
                        derby hat was pulled down until it turned them outward. His hands were in
                        his pockets.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll just go down Broadway,&quot; he said to
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>When he reached Forty-second Street, the fire signs <pb id="VAA2423-552"
                            n="546"/> were already blazing brightly. Crowds were hastening to dine.
                        Through bright windows, at every corner, might be seen gay companies in
                        luxuriant restaurants. There were coaches and crowded cable cars.</p>
                    <p>In his weary and hungry state, he should never have come here. The contrast
                        was too sharp. Even he was recalled keenly to better things.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the use?&quot; he thought.
                        &quot;It&apos;s all up with me. I&apos;ll quit
                        this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>People turned to look after him, so uncouth was his shambling figure. Several
                        officers followed him with their eyes, to see that he did not beg of
                        anybody.</p>
                    <p>Once he paused in an aimless, incoherent sort of way and looked through the
                        windows of an imposing restaurant, before which blazed a fire sign, and
                        through the large, plate windows of which could be seen the red and gold
                        decorations, the palms, the white napery, and shining glassware, and, above
                        all, the comfortable crowd. Weak as his mind had become, his hunger was
                        sharp enough to show the importance of this. He stopped stock still, his
                        frayed trousers soaking in the slush, and peered foolishly in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Eat,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;That&apos;s right, eat.
                        Nobody else wants any.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then his voice dropped even lower, and his mind half lost the fancy it
                        had.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s mighty cold,&quot; he said. &quot;Awful
                        cold.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At Broadway and Thirty-ninth Street was blazing, in incandescent fire,
                        Carrie&apos;s name. &quot;Carrie Madenda,&quot; it read,
                        &quot;and the Casino Company.&quot; All the wet, snowy sidewalk was
                        bright with this radiated fire. It was so bright that it attracted
                        Hurstwood&apos;s gaze. He looked up, and then at a large, gilt-framed
                        poster-board, on which was a fine lithograph of Carrie, lifesize, <pb
                            id="VAA2423-553" n="547"/> Hurstwood gazed at it a moment, snuffling and
                        hunching one shoulder, as if something were scratching him. He was so run
                        down, however, that his mind was not exactly clear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s you,&quot; he said at last, addressing her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wasn&apos;t good enough for you, was I? Huh!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He lingered, trying to think logically. This was no longer possible with
                        him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s got it,&quot; he said, incoherently, thinking of
                        money. &quot;Let her give use some.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He started around to the side door. Then he forgot what he was going for and
                        paused, pushing his hands deeper to warm the wrists. Suddenly it returned.
                        The stage door! That was it.</p>
                    <p>He approached that entrance and went in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well?&quot; said the attendant, staring at him. Seeing him
                        pause, he went over and shoved him. &quot;Get out of here,&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to see Miss Madenda,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You do, eh?&quot; the other said, almost tickled at the
                        spectacle. &quot;Get out of here,&quot; and he shoved him again.
                        Hurstwood had no strength to resist.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to see Miss Madenda,&quot; he tried to explain, even as
                        he was being hustled away. &quot;I&apos;m all right. I&quot;</p>
                    <p>The man gave him a last push and closed the door. As he did so, Hurstwood
                        slipped and fell in the snow. It hurt him, and some vague sense of shame
                        returned. He began to cry and swear foolishly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;God damned dog!&quot; he said. &quot;Damned old
                        cur,&quot; wiping the slush from his worthless coat. &quot;II hired
                        such people as you once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Now a fierce feeling against Carrie welled upjust one fierce, angry thought
                        before the whole thing slipped out of his mind.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-554" n="548"/>
                    <p>&quot;She owes me something to eat,&quot; he said. &quot;She owes
                        it to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hopelessly he turned back into Broadway again and slopped onward and away,
                        begging, crying, losing track of his thoughts, one after another, as a mind
                        decayed and disjointed is wont to do.</p>
                    <p>It was truly a wintry evening, a few days later, when his one distinct mental
                        decision was reached. Already, at four o&apos;clock, the sombre hue of
                        night was thickening the air. A heavy snow was fallinga fine picking,
                        whipping snow, borne forward by a swift wind in long, thin lines. The
                        streets were bedded with itsix inches of cold, soft carpet, churned to a
                        dirty brown by the crush of teams and the feet of men. Along Broadway men
                        picked their way in ulsters and umbrellas. Along the Bowery, men slouched
                        through it with collars and hats pulled over their ears. In the former
                        thorough-fare business men and travellers were making for comfortable
                        hotels. In the latter, crowds on cold errands shifted past dingy stores, in
                        the deep recesses of which lights were already gleaming. There were early
                        lights in the cable cars, whose usual clatter was reduced by the mantle
                        about the wheels. The whole city was muffled by this fast-thickening
                        mantle.</p>
                    <p>In her comfortable chambers at the Waldorf, Carrie was reading at this time
                        &quot;Pre Goriot,&quot; which Ames had recommended to her. It was so
                        strong, and Ames&apos;s mere recommendation had so aroused her interest,
                        that she caught nearly the full sympathetic significance of it. For the
                        first time, it was being borne in upon her how silly and worthless had been
                        her earlier reading, as a whole. Becoming wearied, however, she yawned and
                        came to the window, looking out upon the old winding procession of carriages
                        rolling up Fifth Avenue.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-555" n="549"/>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t it bad?&quot; she observed to Lola.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Terrible!&quot; said that little lady, joining her. &quot;I
                        hope it snows enough to go sleigh riding.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; said Carrie, with whom the sufferings of Father
                        Goriot were still been. &quot;That&apos;s all you think of.
                        Aren&apos;t you sorry for the people who haven&apos;t any-thing
                        to-night?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course I am,&quot; said Lola; &quot;but what can I do? I
                        haven&apos;t anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Carrie smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You wouldn&apos;t care, if you had,&quot; she returned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would, too,&quot; said Lola. &quot;But people never gave
                        me anything when I was hard up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t it just awful? &quot;said Carrie, studying the
                        winter&apos;s storm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look at that man over there,&quot; laughed Lola, who had caught
                        sight of some one falling down. &quot;How sheepish men look when they
                        fall, don&apos;t they?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll have to take a coach to-night,&quot; answered
                        Carrie, absently.</p>
                    <p>In the lobby of the Imperial, Mr. Charles Drouet was just arriving, shaking
                        the snow from a very handsome ulster. Bad weather had driven him home early
                        and stirred his desire for those pleasures which shut out the snow and gloom
                        of life. A good dinner, the company of a young woman, and an evening at the
                        theatre were the chief things for him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, hello, Harry!&quot; he said, addressing a lounger in one
                        of the comfortable lobby chairs. &quot;How are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, about six and six,&quot; said the other.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rotten weather, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I should say,&quot; said the other.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve been just sitting here thinking where I&apos;d
                        go to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-556" n="550"/>
                    <p>&quot;Come along with me,&quot; said Drouet. &quot;I can
                        introduce you to something dead swell.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who is it?&quot; said the other.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, a couple of girls over here in Fortieth Street. We could have a
                        dandy time. I was just looking for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Supposing we get &apos;em and take &apos;em out to
                        dinner?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure,&quot; said Drouet. &quot;Wait&apos;ll I go
                        upstairs and change my clothes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll be in the barber shop,&quot; said the
                        other. &quot;I want to get a shave.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Drouet, creaking off in his good shoes
                        toward the elevator. The old butterfly was as light on the wing as ever.</p>
                    <p>On an incoming vestibuled Pullman, speeding at forty miles an hour through
                        the snow of the evening, were three others, all related.</p>
                    <p>&quot;First call for dinner in the dining-car,&quot; a Pullman
                        servitor was announcing, as he hastened through the aisle in snow-white
                        apron and jacket.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t believe I want to play any more,&quot; said
                        the youngest, a black-haired beauty, turned supercilious by fortune, as she
                        pushed a euchre hand away from her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shall we go into dinner?&quot; inquired her husband, who was
                        all that fine raiment can make.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, not yet,&quot; she answered. &quot;I don&apos;t
                        want to play any more, though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jessica,&quot; said her mother, who was also a study in what
                        good clothing can do for age, &quot;push that pin down in your
                        tieit&apos;s coming up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jessica obeyed, incidentally touching at her lovely hair and looking at a
                        little jewel-faced watch. Her husband studied her, for beauty, even cold, is
                        fascinating from one point of view.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-557" n="551"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we won&apos;t have much more of this weather,&quot;
                        he said. &quot;It only takes two weeks to get to Rome.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hurstwood nestled comfortably in her corner and smiled. It was so nice
                        to be the mother-in-law of a rich young manone whose financial state had
                        borne her personal inspection.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you suppose the boat will sail promptly?&quot; asked
                        Jessica, &quot;if it keeps up like this?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; answered her husband. &quot;This
                        won&apos;t make any difference.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Passing down the aisle came a very fair-haired banker&apos;s son, also of
                        Chicago, who had long eyed this supercilious beauty. Even now he did not
                        hesitate to glance at her, and she was conscious of it. With a specially
                        conjured show of indifference, she turned her pretty face wholly away. It
                        was not wifely modesty at all. By so much was her pride satisfied.</p>
                    <p>At this moment Hurstwood stood before a dirty four-story building in a side
                        street quite near the Bowery, whose one-time coat of buff had been changed
                        by soot and rain. He mingled with a crowd of mena crowd which had been, and
                        was still, gathering by degrees.</p>
                    <p>It began with the approach of two or three, who hung about the closed wooden
                        doors and beat their feet to keep them warm. They had on faded derby hats
                        with dents in them. Their misfit coats were heavy with melted snow and
                        turned up at the collars. Their trousers were mere bags, frayed at the
                        bottom and wobbling over big, soppy shoes, torn at the sides and worn almost
                        to shreds. They made no effort to go in, but shifted ruefully about, digging
                        their hands deep in their pockets and leering at the crowd and the
                        increasing lamps. With the minutes, increased the number. There were old men
                        with grizzled beards and sunken eyes, <pb id="VAA2423-558" n="552"/> men who
                        were comparatively young but shrunken by diseases, men who were middle-aged.
                        None were fat. There was a face in the thick of the collection which was as
                        white as drained veal. There was another red as brick. Some came with thin,
                        rounded shoulders, others with wooden legs, still others with frames so lean
                        that clothes only flapped about them. There were great ears, swollen noses,
                        thick lips, and, above all, red, blood-shot eyes. Not a normal, healthy face
                        in the whole mass; not a straight figure; not a straightforward, steady
                        glance.</p>
                    <p>In the drive of the wind and sleet they pushed in on one another. There were
                        wrists, unprotected by coat or pocket, which were red with cold. There were
                        ears, half covered by every conceivable semblance of a hat, which still
                        looked stiff and bitten. In the snow they shifted, now one foot, now
                        another, almost rocking in unison.</p>
                    <p>With the growth of the crowd about the door came a murmur. It was not
                        conversation, but a running comment directed at any one in general. It
                        contained oaths and slang phrases.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By damn, I wish they&apos;d hurry up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look at the copper watchin&apos;.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe it ain&apos;t winter, nuther!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wisht I was in Sing Sing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Now a sharper lash of wind cut down and they huddled closer. It was an
                        edging, shifting, pushing throng. There was no anger, no pleading, no
                        threatening words. It was all sullen endurance, unlightened by either wit or
                        good fellowship.</p>
                    <p>A carriage went jingling by with some reclining figure in it. One of the men
                        nearest the door saw it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look at the bloke ridin&apos;.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He ain&apos;t so cold.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2423-559" n="553"/>
                    <p>&quot;Eh, eh, eh!&quot; yelled another, the carriage having long
                        since passed out of hearing.</p>
                    <p>Little by little the night crept on. Along the walk a crowd turned out on its
                        way home. Men and shop-girls went by with quick steps. The cross-town cars
                        began to be crowded. The gas lamps were blazing, and every window bloomed
                        ruddy with a steady flame. Still the crowd hung about the door,
                        unwavering.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ain&apos;t they ever goin&apos; to open up?&quot;
                        queried a hoarse voice, suggestively.</p>
                    <p>This seemed to renew the general interest in the closed door, and many gazed
                        in that direction. They looked at it as dumb brutes look, as dogs paw and
                        whine and study the knob. They shifted and blinked and muttered, now a
                        curse, now a comment. Still they waited and still the snow whirled and cut
                        them with biting flakes. On the old hats and peaked shoulders it was piling.
                        It gathered in little heaps and curves and no one brushed it off. In the
                        centre of the crowd the warmth and steam melted it, and water trickled off
                        hat rims and down noses, which the owners could not reach to scratch. On the
                        outer rim the piles remained unmelted. Hurstwood, who could not get in the
                        centre, stood with head lowered to the weather and bent his form.</p>
                    <p>A light appeared through the transom overhead. It sent a thrill of
                        possibility through the watchers. There was a murmur of recognition. At last
                        the bars grated inside and the crowd pricked up its ears. Footsteps shuffled
                        within and it murmured again. Some one called: &quot;Slow up there,
                        now,&quot; and then the door opened. It was push and jam for a minute,
                        with grim, beast silence to prove its quality, and then it melted inward,
                        like logs floating, and disappeared. There were wet hats and wet shoulders,
                        a cold, shrunken, disgruntled mass, <pb id="VAA2423-560" n="554"/> pouring
                        in between bleak walls. It was just six o&apos;clock and there was
                        supper in every hurrying pedestrian&apos;s face. And yet no supper was
                        provided herenothing but beds.</p>
                    <p>Hurstwood laid down his fifteen cents and crept off with weary steps to his
                        allotted room. It was a dingy affairwooden, dusty, hard. A small gas-jet
                        furnished sufficient light for so rueful a corner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hm!&quot; he said, clearing his throat and locking the
                        door.</p>
                    <p>Now he began leisurely to take off his clothes, but stopped first with his
                        coat, and tucked it along the crack under the door. His vest he arranged in
                        the same place. His old wet, cracked hat he laid softly upon the table. Then
                        he pulled off his shoes and lay down.</p>
                    <p>It seemed as if he thought a while, for now he arose and turned the gas out,
                        standing calmly in the blackness, hidden from view. After a few moments, in
                        which he reviewed nothing, but merely hesitated, he turned the gas on again,
                        but applied no match. Even then he stood there, hidden wholly in that
                        kindness which is night, while the uprising fumes filled the room. When the
                        odour reached his nostrils, he quit his attitude and fumbled for the
                        bed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the use?&quot; he said, weakly, as he stretched
                        himself to rest.</p>
                    <p>And now Carrie had attained that which in the beginning semed life&apos;s
                        object, or, at least, such fraction of it as human beings ever attain of
                        their original desires. She could look about on her gowns and carriage, her
                        furniture and bank account. Friends there were, as the world takes itthose
                        who would bow and smile in acknowledgment of her success. For these she had
                            <pb id="VAA2423-561" n="555"/> once craved. Applause there was, and
                        publicityonce far off, essential things, but now grown trivial and
                        indifferent. Beauty alsoher type of lovelinessand yet she was lonely. In her
                        rocking-chair she sat, when not otherwise engagedsinging and dreaming.</p>
                    <p>Thus in life there is ever the intellectual and the emotional naturethe mind
                        that reasons, and the mind that feels. Of one come the men of actiongenerals
                        and statesmen; of the other, the poets and dreamersartists all.</p>
                    <p>As harps in the wind, the latter respond to every breath of fancy, voicing in
                        their moods all the ebb and flow of the ideal.</p>
                    <p>Man has not yet comprehended the dreamer any more than he has the ideal. For
                        him the laws and morals of the world are unduly severe. Ever hearkening to
                        the sound of beauty, straining for the flash of its distant wings, he
                        watches to follow, wearying his feet in travelling. So watched Carrie, so
                        followed, rocking and singing.</p>
                    <p>And it must be remembered that reason had little part in this. Chicago
                        dawning, she saw the city offering more of loveliness than she had ever
                        known, and instinctively, by force of her moods alone, clung to it. In for
                        raiment and elegant surroundings, men seemed to be contented. Hence, she
                        drew near these things. Chicago, New York; Drouet, Hurstwood; the world of
                        fashion and the world of stagethese were but incidents. Not them, but that
                        which they represented, she longed for. Time proved the representation
                        false.</p>
                    <p>Oh, the tangle of human life! How dimly as yet we see. Here was Carrie, in
                        the beginning poor, unsophisticated, emotional; responding with desire to
                        everything most lovely in life, yet finding herself turned as by a wall.
                        Laws to say: &quot;Be allured, if you <pb id="VAA2423-562" n="556"/>
                        will, by everything lovely, but draw not nigh unless by
                        righteousness.&quot; Convention to say: &quot;You shall not better
                        your situation save by honest labour.&quot; If honest labour be
                        unremunerative and difficult to endure; if it be the long, long road which
                        never reaches beauty, but wearies the feet and the heart; if the drag to
                        follow beauty be such that one abandons the admired way, taking rather the
                        despised path leading to her dreams quickly, who shall cast the first stone?
                        Not evil, but longing for that which is better, more often directs the steps
                        of the erring. Not evil, but goodness more often allures the feeling mind
                        unused to reason.</p>
                    <p>Amid the tinsel and shine of her state walked Carrie, unhappy. As when Drouet
                        took her, she had thought: &quot;Now am I lifted into that which is best
                        &quot;; as when Hurstwood seemingly offered her the better way:
                        &quot;Now am I happy.&quot; But since the world goes its way past
                        all who will not partake of its folly, she now found herself alone. Her
                        purse was open to him whose need was greatest. In her walks on Broadway, she
                        no longer thought of the elegance of the creatures who passed her. Had they
                        more of that peace and beauty which glimmered afar off, then were they to be
                        envied.</p>
                    <p>Drouet abandoned his claim and was seen no more. Of Hurstwood&apos;s
                        death she was not even aware. A slow, black boat setting out from the pier
                        at Twenty-seventh Street upon its weekly errand bore, with many others, his
                        nameless body to the Potter&apos;s Field.</p>
                    <p>Thus passed all that was of interest concerning these twain in their relation
                        to her. Their influence upon her life is explicable alone by the nature of
                        her longings. Time was when both represented for her all that was most
                        potent in earthly success. They were the personal representatives of a state
                        most blessed to attainthe titled ambassadors of comfort and peace, <pb
                            id="VAA2423-563" n="557"/> aglow with their credentials. It is but
                        natural that when the world which they represented no longer allured her,
                        its ambassadors should be discredited. Even had Hurstwood returned in his
                        original beauty and glory, he could not now have allured her. She had
                        learned that in his world, as in her own present state, was not
                        happiness.</p>
                    <p>Sitting alone, she was now an illustration of the devious ways by which one
                        who feels, rather than reasons, may be led in the pursuit of beauty. Though
                        often disillusioned, she was still waiting for that halc yon day when she
                        should be led forth among dreams become real. Ames had pointed out a farther
                        step, but on and on beyond that, if accomplished, would lie others for her.
                        It was forever to be the pursuit of that radiance of delight which tints the
                        distant hilltops of the world.</p>
                    <p>Oh, Carrie, Carrie! Oh, blind strivings of the human heart! Onward, onward,
                        it saith, and where beauty leads, there it follows. Whether it be the tinkle
                        of a lone sheep bell o&apos;er some quiet landscape, or the glimmer of
                        beauty in sylvan places, or the show of soul in some passing eye, the heart
                        knows and makes answer, following. It is when the feet weary and hope seems
                        vain that the heartaches and the longings arise. Know, then, that for you is
                        neither surfeit nor content. In your rocking-chair, by your window dreaming,
                        shall you long, alone. In your rocking-chair, by your window, shall you
                        dream such happiness as you may never feel.</p>
