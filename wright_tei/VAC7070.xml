CHAPTER I.&#xD;
THE Sounds of a barrelorgan vibrate through the evening air.&#xD;
"Home, sweet home" floats sweetly on the waves of the breeze,&#xD;
that fans the face of the pleasant valley. The music is in keep-&#xD;
ing with the charming landscape, which streches from the rock-&#xD;
bound, but picturesque and romantic coast of Maine-but the&#xD;
musician is not; and the glance, we cast on him, jars unpleasant-&#xD;
ly with the feeling of contentment, that has imperceptibly stolen&#xD;
over us. The man is evidently a foreigner, a native of the sunny&#xD;
land, that boasts of Rome and Naples and his pale, careworn face&#xD;
shows plainly, that he is deeply sensitive to the tune, he plays.&#xD;
Home! sweet home! Alas ! no people in the world are so devoted-&#xD;
ly attached to their native country, as the Italians. Even the&#xD;
most prosperous rof that race never overcome a yearning for&#xD;
"'beautiful Italy" and yet our minstrel does not belong to fort-&#xD;
une's favorites. He surely misses his native country; for his hol-&#xD;
low eye mirrors a melancholy sadness, a pain intense to distrac-&#xD;
tion. The fickle, changing clime of the new world does not agree&#xD;
with his constitution and even a careless observer can hardly fail&#xD;
to discover, that consumption, the arch destroyer of America's&#xD;
youth and strength, has made a fearful havoc upon the musician's&#xD;
form, once so noble and vigorous. His cheeks are hollow though&#xD;
covered with a treacherous bloom; his body has become emaciat-&#xD;
,ed to the thinness of a skeleton and only his eyes have retained&#xD;
their lustre. Yes, they have even gained in brilliancy and in con-&#xD;
nection with the hair of raven blackness, which surrounds his&#xD;
temples in rich profusion, impart to his face a ghastly pallor, pain-&#xD;
ful to behold. His strength is gone; for, though relieved of the&#xD;
weight of the instrument by a supporting frame, on which it stands,&#xD;
his hand turns the crank with a languor, inexpressibly sad. In&#xD;

consequence of this the air, so tei er in itself, assumes a mourn-&#xD;
ful sadness, apt to bring tears int our eyes. It has that effect at&#xD;
least upon a little girl, standing c ose by the wandering minstrel's&#xD;
side and holding in a caressing manner his unengaged hand. She.&#xD;
seems to be about twelve years of age and a family resemblance&#xD;
lets us guess the relation of father and daughter between the two.&#xD;
She has his black waving tresses and the large lucid eye, though&#xD;
the color of the latter is more of a bluish, than a blackish tint.&#xD;
The child is poorly clad, as is the man and the tattered dress&#xD;
of faded silk half covers, half reveals a body of perfect propor-&#xD;
tions, but yet too angular for our ideas of beauty. The frock only&#xD;
reaches to the knee, leaving the leg beneath it and the foot ex-&#xD;
posed. The child presses her father's hand with earnest devotion&#xD;
to her cheek and the sad and tender glance with which she scans,.&#xD;
his face, betrays a depth of feeling and an understanding beyond&#xD;
her years. Does she fully comprehend the precarious condition&#xD;
of her father's health? the delicacy of the tie, that unites them&#xD;
and may be ruptured by the first rough contact with the world?&#xD;
We do not know; but we know, that the group before us, if not of&#xD;
ideal beauty, is such as the sculptor or painter likes to choose,&#xD;
when he intends, to remind us of the frail mortality of our race.&#xD;
The pair stands on the highroad leading through one of those&#xD;
pretty villages, which only New-England can show. One side of&#xD;
it is lined with little cottages encased in pretty gardens and the&#xD;
other with an iron railingenclosing the pleasure grounds of a stately&#xD;
mansion looming with grace and elegance from the dense cluster&#xD;
of surrounding shrubs and trees. Opposite the Italian and his-&#xD;
daughter the railing curves inward, and displays a handsome&#xD;
double gate, shutting up a broad well kept carriagedrive, whose&#xD;
.sides are adorned with gay flowerbeds in full bloom. The road,&#xD;
running at right angles against the sea, is lost in clusters of bush-&#xD;
es, above which the blue expanse of water, dotted with distant&#xD;
sails becomes visible. Turning landward, the pike win s through&#xD;
broad valley, dotted with farmhouses and orchards nd closed&#xD;
in the distance by a sweep of semicircular woodlandranges,.which&#xD;
with their terminus lean on the ocean. The road after leaving&#xD;
the village passes through the-buildings of a large factory and at&#xD;
last creeps over the hills, looking like the ribbon, with which we&#xD;
tie a garland.' The suni approaching the western sky betokens&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                         5&#xD;
the neighborhood of the evening hours, whose freshness will&#xD;
pleasantly relieve the intense heat of a sultry summerday. From&#xD;
the factory above mentioned a stream of men  id women pours&#xD;
into the street, all carrying their dinnerbuckets/and for the most&#xD;
part wending their way towards the village and turning here and&#xD;
there into the houses lining the way. Some of them stop, as they&#xD;
come to the minstrel and his daughter; they listen to the plain-&#xD;
tive music and then with warm compassion place a coin iqto the&#xD;
box, which the girl passes round. A sweet smile of the little&#xD;
-creature and a graceful nod of the head thank them for their&#xD;
charity and then they part, reflecting on their way on the caprice&#xD;
of fortune, which metes its favors out with lavish hands to some,&#xD;
and denies even the indispensable mite to others.&#xD;
The little girl however hastens back to her father, attracted by&#xD;
:a violent fit of coughing, which threatens to put a stop not only&#xD;
to the music, but even to the musician himself. The little one&#xD;
has no such fears, for, alas, she is used to see her father suffer;&#xD;
still she knows that after an attack like this he needs her assist-&#xD;
nee, trifling as it is, for he is almost unable to stand on his feet.&#xD;
Indeed, as she approaches him, she notices a tremor going&#xD;
through his feeble frame; his hands rest on the organ for support&#xD;
his head sinks wearily on his breast and from his mouth issues f&#xD;
fearful stream of blood, taking away on its currents the last sparks&#xD;
,of vitality, that remained in the wornout frame.e&#xD;
A fearful shriek of the girl stops the passers-by and hurrying&#xD;
near the unfortunate man, they come just in time to receive the&#xD;
sinking form into their arms and thus save it front a rough fall&#xD;
upon the ground. They carry him to the greensward lining&#xD;
the side of the road next-to the railing and busy themselves about&#xD;
him with the confusion of people, not exactly knowing what to&#xD;
do. While some hurry for the doctor, others cry for water and&#xD;
endeavor to stop the blood, which still continues to ooze from&#xD;
the mouth, though .with lessened violence. Alas the poor fellow&#xD;
had but little of the precious liquid and the fountain drying up,&#xD;
the current of course began to slacken. The people around him&#xD;
shook their heads and with pitying countenances gazed upon the&#xD;
little girl, kneeling at the side of her father, holding his hands in&#xD;
hers and with pleading fervor calling on him, to return to consci-&#xD;
ousness and her. She used a foreign tongue, but yet the crowd&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7070-00000004"/>&#xD;
6                      DOLORES.&#xD;
understood her, for there is a language, which every body com-&#xD;
prehends, the language of love and sadness. There were few eyes&#xD;
dry in that assembly and many seemed more affected, than the&#xD;
child itself. No wonder! the poor thing was half stupified and&#xD;
failed to realize the greatness of the loss in store for her. The&#xD;
hemorrhage had frightened her, but she scarcely understood the&#xD;
significance of the 1 enomenon. Her father had suffered so much&#xD;
and so long, that sie failed to comprehend the fact of his near&#xD;
release, his deliverance from all further trouble.'&#xD;
Now the doctor made his appearance. He gazed a moment and&#xD;
shook his head. Looking around in the crowd, that was increas-&#xD;
ing every minute, he said:&#xD;
"My friends, this man is dying; we must take him to some&#xD;
shelter. Is there nobody present, that lives close by and is will-&#xD;
ing to lend his roof to a suffering fellow-mortal, to die in peace?"&#xD;
.Several voices responded to the call; but at this moment the&#xD;
stamp of hoofs and the rolling of carriagewheels became audible&#xD;
and a minute afterwards a welldressed gentleman accompanied by&#xD;
a little girl stepped into the circle. The crowd drew back re-&#xD;
spectfully and from this and other signs we conclude that the new&#xD;
comer holds a conspicuous position in the neighborhood. He is&#xD;
a portly man of medium size, between 35 and 40. His dress is of&#xD;
fine material and fashionable cut, but he wears it with a careless&#xD;
ease, approaching slovenliness. His face is broad and good-&#xD;
natured and as his eyes gaze upon the dying stranger, they show&#xD;
a sympathy and compassion, that cannot help impressing us favor-&#xD;
ably as to the character of the man. The only thing we do not&#xD;
like, is the ltoseness of the lower face, the want of expression&#xD;
around the mouth, which, as psychologists assure us, indicates a&#xD;
lack of firmness and decision.   The little girl seems of the same&#xD;
age as the Italian's daughter ; but she is of a very different type..&#xD;
While the child of the south is thin, angular, with sunburnt skin&#xD;
and black hair, the new comer bears the impress of the north..&#xD;
Her complexion is of a snowywhiteness, her hair of a hue bet-&#xD;
ween gold and flax.  Dimples adorn her chin and the plump&#xD;
cheeks, over which the glow of health is spread in a manner more&#xD;
distinct, than delicate. Her lips vie in color with the cherry and&#xD;
the eyes are of a light but charming blue. The face lacks nothing-&#xD;
but intellect, to make it attractive; it has the beauty of the waxen&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                         7&#xD;
doll, in which we miss nothing so much, as the absence of anima-&#xD;
tion. Timidly the girl holds on to her father's coat; but as she&#xD;
peeps around, to she the poor invalid, we notice her father's ex-&#xD;
pression of good nature in her eyes.&#xD;
"Why, what, is this, Doctor?" asked the new corner "what is&#xD;
the matter with the poor fellow?"&#xD;
"A hemorrhage of the worst kind, Mr. Fox. I was just trying&#xD;
to get the patient under shelter. These people volunteered to take&#xD;
him to their houses."&#xD;
"Just like them, good and kind, as ever. But the man would&#xD;
be troublesome to them; better take him to my.house. There is&#xD;
lots of room and better accommodations. John, just give the&#xD;
reins to Richard and come this way. So, who else will lend a&#xD;
hand? That's right; but gently lads, the poor fellow will feel&#xD;
every movement. Now take him to the house, lads, to the front&#xD;
room in the'bas ement. And this is his daughter? ,Poor child,&#xD;
come give me your hand. No? Well go with your father then. I&#xD;
reckon you wont have him much longer anyhow, eh Doctor?"&#xD;
"I fear not Sir. The man may once more return to conscious-&#xD;
ness, but he cannot live much longer. He is evidently in the last&#xD;
stage of consumption and this hemorrhage will take him off."&#xD;
"Well Doctor, do the best you can for him; I'll see to the pay-&#xD;
ment of the bill. Jim, take that instrument ' off the road and put&#xD;
it somewhere out of the way. Take care, that Mrs. Fox don't&#xD;
stumble over it tho', when she returns ; you know, she don't like&#xD;
vulgar things.'&#xD;
"Yes Sir," the servant spoken to replied, accompanying his re-&#xD;
sponse with a knowing look. Taking the organ, he carried it to&#xD;
the house, trying on the road to elicit some music from it, by turn-&#xD;
ing the crank. But the fir't sound made him start; it was so&#xD;
much out of the way on this sad occasion, that Jim avoided the&#xD;
crank with scrupulous care and taking a back door, executed the&#xD;
order of his master.&#xD;
In the meantime the patient had been deposited on the lounge&#xD;
of a room, that bore the character of something between a library&#xD;
and a smokingroom. The doctor applied the proper restoratives&#xD;
and after a few minutes had the satisfaction of seeing him open&#xD;
his eyes. The little girl had not relinquished herf ather's hand-&#xD;
for a moment, and now when she saw him returning to- conscious-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

ness, she uttered a cry of delight and in her native tongue began&#xD;
to speak to him. , The Doctor however checked her.&#xD;
"My dear child" he said, laying his hand upon her shoulder and&#xD;
bending over her "you must not trouble your father now, for he&#xD;
is very sick.. If you can be a good girl and keep quiet for a little&#xD;
while, he may soon be well enough, to speak to you."&#xD;
The child listened attentively and showed by a nod, that she&#xD;
understood the physician. . It evidently cost her a struggle, to&#xD;
obey, but she conquered and regaining hold of her father's hand,&#xD;
relapsed into silence.&#xD;
The patient also had heard the doctor and evidently understood&#xD;
him. A sad smile flitted over his features and moving his lips, he&#xD;
made an attempt, but failed in .the effort to speak, The 'doctor&#xD;
noticed it and said:&#xD;
"Keep still my good man; you are not strong enough to speak&#xD;
yet. We,l1get you something to strengthen you."&#xD;
"Shall I send for some wine ?" Mr. Fox inquired.&#xD;
"You may as well. It would hardly do, to give him wine, if&#xD;
there was any hope of recovery. But there is not and the stimu-&#xD;
lus will enable the poor fellow to speak. He may have some-&#xD;
thing to communicate to us or to his dauo-hter.",&#xD;
The wine was brought,--a fiery sher  and its effect upon the&#xD;
dying man was wonderful. His look regained its vivacity, and&#xD;
his tongue the power of speech. Looking around he seemed to&#xD;
scrutinize the persons present and at last kept his gaze fixed upon&#xD;
Mr. Fox. He seemed to guess, that this was the proprietor of&#xD;
the house and with a feeble gesture beckoned him to his -side.&#xD;
"You are the master of this house ?" he c asked in low tones and&#xD;
a foreign accent.&#xD;
"Yes, Sir, that. I am." Mr. Fox responded with a kind nod,&#xD;
"and if there is anything I can do for you, just let me know.&#xD;
You may be sure, that it shall be attended to"&#xD;
"You are very kind" said the Italian and a smile at once sweet&#xD;
and melancholy flew over his features. "You are a gentil huomo,&#xD;
I know and will be kind to my daughter, when I am gone ?"&#xD;
"Of course Sir, the girl shall be taken care of. If nothing else&#xD;
troubles your mind, you may die in peace."&#xD;
The face of the Italian showed a struggle.  At last he said:&#xD;
"Take the portfolio from my pocket, I am too weak."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
His wish was fulfilled and an elegant diary, evidently a remnant&#xD;
of better days, produced. On seeing it, the stranger's eye lit up&#xD;
and his face assumed an aspect of pride and dignity, at once sud-&#xD;
den and startling.&#xD;
"You open" he said and Fox, obeying his injunction, produced&#xD;
several papers, which he handed to the patient.&#xD;
* "Now listen" said the Italian, making a great effort to speak&#xD;
clearly and concisely, "I look like a beggar, but oh, I am not an&#xD;
ordinary one. I was once ? noble duke in my native country;&#xD;
but wishing to free it from the yoke of Austria I joined an insur-&#xD;
rection against that power. We failed and incurred the penalty,&#xD;
attached to such attempts. My poor wife died in this country&#xD;
from want and exposure, and I follow her from the same cause.&#xD;
But there is my daughter Dolores- ali! truly has she been nam-&#xD;
ed; for under sufferings she has been reared, the last member of a&#xD;
noble race. What is to become of'her? Will she grow up in&#xD;
ignorance and poverty? Oh! how her destiny afflicts my dying&#xD;
hour !"&#xD;
He stopped and covering his face with his hands, betrayed by&#xD;
groans and sighs the deepness of his sorrow. Again his daughter&#xD;
spoke to him in Italian, and he listened to her voice, as if angels&#xD;
had addressed him. Fox was deeply affected by this scene and&#xD;
wishing to comfort the poor sufferer, repeated his promise to take&#xD;
care of the girl after her father's death. Still the man seemed not&#xD;
satisfied ; but turning to the owner of the house, he said with much&#xD;
hesitancy and indecision.&#xD;
'But my daughter is the duchess of Gatana; will you raise her&#xD;
a menial, a low, ignorant servant ?"&#xD;
Why no" Fox replied,slightly embarrassed'but evidently wish-&#xD;
ing to spare the feelings of the dying man "if she i0 a lady she&#xD;
ought to receive the education of one."&#xD;
"Oh! God bless you; you take a burden off my heart. And you&#xD;
would be so good as to charge yourself with her education ?"&#xD;
"Yes Sir, 'I will" said Fox impressed by the earnestness of the&#xD;
Italian.&#xD;
"You give me the word of a gentilhuomo ?"&#xD;
"If you mean the word of a gentleman: I will."&#xD;
"Thank you, Sir, thank you. You give me ease and comfort.&#xD;
You swear, to: do it by this symbol ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
In his eager efforts for his daughter's welfare the patient's.&#xD;
strength had much increased and he was able .to pull from his&#xD;
bosom a.small but beautifully wrought crucifix of gold and ebony&#xD;
and to hold it to rds Mr. Fox, who as a protestant was some-&#xD;
thing loth, to ace mmodate himself to the notionsof a catholic.&#xD;
Still the look of intense suspense in the eye of the dying man was&#xD;
unendurable and wishing to convince him of the sincerity of his&#xD;
intention, he laid his hand upon the crucifix and said :&#xD;
"I swear."&#xD;
New the Italian seemed satisfied. A deep tranquillity spread&#xD;
over his beautiful face, which seemed to have lost every trace of&#xD;
the fatal disease, that had destroyed its owner. lie took his&#xD;
daughter's hand and said to her :&#xD;
"Dolores, I must leave you.......-&#xD;
Before he could proceed, the, impetuous girl was on. her knees&#xD;
and laying her head close to his, said with a voice almost drown-&#xD;
ed by sobbing:&#xD;
"No father dear, you must not leave poor Dolores alone. What&#xD;
oh what is she to do without her dear father ?"&#xD;
Tears started from the father's .eye, but checking his emotion&#xD;
with his whole remaining strength, he said :&#xD;
"I know you will miss me, Dolores; but you will also get a&#xD;
good home and a guardian, who will -provide for you, and that you&#xD;
know, your poor sick father was unable to do. I should like to&#xD;
live on your account, my dearest child; but at the same time, I&#xD;
am weary, so weary, that I delight to think, I shall soon steep the&#xD;
long, deep sleep in the cool ground. Mourn for me my daughter,&#xD;
but take comfort in the thought, that it is all for the best. 4 Will&#xD;
my strong, brave Dolores promise this?",&#xD;
A low "yes" almost stifled .by heartrending sighs came as an&#xD;
answer from the lips of the little girl.&#xD;
"That is right, dear" said her father, laying his hand upon herm&#xD;
curly head. "And you Sir, take care of these papers. They con-&#xD;
tain the marriage certificate of her parents and a list of her estat-&#xD;
es. True, they now only exist on paper, for y cruel dynasty has&#xD;
snatched them from her; but God is merciful and may some day&#xD;
restore her to her rank and fortune. Take good care of the pa-&#xD;
pers, Sir."&#xD;
Fox promised repeatedly, to fulfil all the injunctions of the suf-&#xD;

ferer with unswerving fidelity and thereby rendered his last hour&#xD;
comparatively light and happy ; but the excitement now passing&#xD;
away left the patient doubly weak and it was evident to all&#xD;
present that his dissolution was fast approaching. With one of&#xD;
his hands on his daughter's head and the other enclosed in hers.&#xD;
lie now and then whispered a word of love and comfort into her&#xD;
ears, her head still resting close to his. He could no longer speak&#xD;
loud nor raise his hand to beckon; but an impressive glance meet-&#xD;
ing the eye of Mr. Fox, that gentleman bent his head to the&#xD;
patient's ear.&#xD;
"I am happy" the poor man whispered "and you made me so..&#xD;
Remember !"&#xD;
After a while he whispered:&#xD;
"Dolores"&#xD;
This was the last word he spoke. When the child raised her&#xD;
head in response to the call, his eye was becoming fixed and strang-&#xD;
er to death, that she was, she could not mistake, that the moment.,&#xD;
which would make her an orphan, was at hand. Bending intently&#xD;
over his face, she watched every motion of his body. She saw&#xD;
the last tremor creeping through his limbs, saw his body stretch&#xD;
and lengthen and felt his hands grow cold in hers. Thus long she&#xD;
had repressed her grief, perhaps; in obedience to his injunction,&#xD;
perhaps also from the wish of making his departure as light and&#xD;
tranquil as possible. This was surely a selfcontrol beyond her&#xD;
years, but then .a single look upon -her pensive face sufficed, to&#xD;
show, that she was no ordinary child. Now however she in-&#xD;
demnified herself for all restraint by an abandonment to grief,&#xD;
which much alarmed the persons present. She cried and' shriek-&#xD;
ed and writhed as if in agonies of pain. She threw herself upon&#xD;
the dead body and clung to him with a veh mence, that made all&#xD;
efforts to withdraw her vain. She seemed deaf to all persuasions&#xD;
and entreaties and for more than an hour would suffer no inter-&#xD;
ference between herself and her grief. At last she calmed downy&#xD;
more from physical exhaustion, than any abatement of her excited&#xD;
feelings. She ceased to sob and cry and allowed Mr. Fox.'to take&#xD;
her hand and speak words of comfort and consolation into her&#xD;
ear. She suffered his daughter, to take her other hand and gent-&#xD;
ly stroke it; she even raised her teardimmed eye to that of the&#xD;
other girl and looked into it with a glance containing wonder-&#xD;

ment, affection and suspicion in a strange mixture. Still she&#xD;
would not be separated frown the body and only when her eyes&#xD;
had closed in slumber and her repose had reached the depth of&#xD;
utter unconsciousness so natural after the exciting scenesthrough&#xD;
which. she had gone, Mr. Fox was able to take her on his arms&#xD;
and carry her to a chamber on the second floor, where a chamber-&#xD;
maid took care of her.&#xD;
"Be kind to the child, Susan." Mr. Fox enjoined upon her&#xD;
"make her comfortable with some of Lucy's dresses and put her&#xD;
to bed. I have to see to matters down stairs."&#xD;
"Yes sir," the girl replied, but she also looked after him with&#xD;
the queer look we noticed on the face of Master Jim, when that&#xD;
worthy carried the organ in. Yet she obeyed his order and tak-&#xD;
ing the sleeping child into the room, layed her on a bed and un-&#xD;
dressed her as gently as she could. Lucy stood by and watched&#xD;
the operation with considerable interest.&#xD;
"Susan" she asked, "she is to stay with us, is she?"&#xD;
Susan winced under the question.&#xD;
"Indeed Lucy, that's more'n I can tell."&#xD;
"Fither says so, at any rate."&#xD;
The servant shrugged her shoulder, a gesture meaning perhaps&#xD;
as much as : "What of that?"  But she said nothing.&#xD;
"Her name is Dolores" the child said, "do you think it a pretty&#xD;
name?"&#xD;
"No Lucy, I dont, nor the child either for that matter. She&#xD;
looks so outlandish."&#xD;
"But I like her; Susan."&#xD;
"You do? well, I know somebody, that wont, I bet."&#xD;
"You mean Richard? I know, he doesn't like her, for he told&#xD;
me so, and called her a gipsy."&#xD;
"TbMd he? well I think your mother wont like her any better.&#xD;
Law's me, what a fuss she'll make, when she finds the brat here."&#xD;
By this -time Dolores had been undressed and provided with&#xD;
one of Lucy's nightgowns and as she lay upon the snowy pillow,&#xD;
her ringlets contrasting strangely with the pallor of her face, on&#xD;
which the traces of a recent grief were still impressed, she formed&#xD;
a sight well calculated to soften any heart. The servant girl's&#xD;
was softened, but she left the room with a shake of her head and&#xD;
~a dubious glance in her homely face-what could it mean?&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
SKIRMISHES.&#xD;
The funeral was over. While Dolores slept the sleep of ex-&#xD;
haustion, Mr. Fox had made all necessary preparations. A plain&#xD;
coffin had been ordered and delivered at the break of dawn the&#xD;
next morning, while Dolores was still sleeping. The body had&#xD;
been laid into the coffin and everything prepared for the last pro-&#xD;
cession without her knowledge. For a moment Mr. Fox had been&#xD;
doubtful as to the propriety of waking Dolores, to let her join it;&#xD;
but at last he had concluded, that it would be cruel, to deprive her&#xD;
of this last change of seeing her dead father. Sad as the cere-&#xD;
mony would be for her, she would at least fully realize her loss&#xD;
and be more inclined to adapt herself to the situation. So she had&#xD;
been wakened and dressed by Susan, who had revived the recol-&#xD;
lection of last night's occurrences as gently as her somewhat rude&#xD;
nature would permit. At first, on wakening, Dolores had threat-&#xD;
ened to rebel; but no sooner had the knowledge of the past return-&#xD;
ed to her mind, when she at once submitted to the girl's directions&#xD;
and, as it were, relapsed into apathy, suffering Susan to dress and&#xD;
conduct her to the funeralchamber much like an automaton., Only&#xD;
on seeing her father in the 'coffin, she had rushed to his side with.&#xD;
a wildness, that threatened a repetition of last night's scene. She&#xD;
had grasped his icy hands, loudly called his name and hiding her&#xD;
head upon his breast, moaned aloud. Yet no tear had entered her&#xD;
eyes and after a few mites she had gained sufficient selfposses-&#xD;
A sion, to follow the admonitions of Mr .Fox, who had kindly taken&#xD;
her hand, assuring her, that he would be a father to her and in-&#xD;
formed her, that they were now going to take her father's remains&#xD;
to his last resting place. Sitting in a carriage at his side she had&#xD;
attended the funeral and in the graveyard behaved with a com-&#xD;
posure remarkable for her years. There is something repugnant&#xD;
in death and in a corpse, especially to children and the form we&#xD;
loved so much when animated, fills us with a secret awe, when life&#xD;
has once departed. 'This is a wise arrangement of nature and&#xD;
Dolores now benefitted by it; tho' it would have been hard to&#xD;
tell, even for more penetrating eyes, than those of Mr. Fox, whether&#xD;
the composure of the little girl was the result of selfcontrol or of&#xD;

an abatement of the grief, with which she mourned her father's&#xD;
death.&#xD;
Now they were back in the villa and from Mr. Fox's abstracted&#xD;
manner it was evident, that.he was pondering upon- the sudden&#xD;
death of the musician and the new duties it had imposed upon&#xD;
him. He called his daughter, bidding her to take the little&#xD;
stranger into the garden and show her the place and when she had&#xD;
obeyed him and taking Dolores by the hand, departed from&#xD;
the room, he paced the floor in a manner not at all in keeping with&#xD;
the ease and,nonchalance, so plainly depicted on his goodnatured&#xD;
face. On the contrary, he seemed extremely nervous a'nd the&#xD;
hands, which were folded on the back, twitched and worked in a&#xD;
manner, almost dangerous to the safety of the fingers. At last&#xD;
Mr. Fox stopped and opening the door, called in a loud voice:&#xD;
"Susan!"&#xD;
"Yes Sir," the menial responded and a moment afterwards made&#xD;
her -appearance at the door, wiping her hands in her apron and&#xD;
holding its corner, even after the operation had been finished.&#xD;
"What may you be wishing, sir?"&#xD;
"Well Susan" Fox addressed her, coming to a dead stop in his&#xD;
walk and trying to look unconcerned. "I called you in, to speak&#xD;
to you about this little girl. I suppose you know, that I promised&#xD;
her father, to take care of her, do you?"&#xD;
"Well yes, I think I did hear, sir."&#xD;
"Now then, as a man of my word, I mean to stick to that prom-&#xD;
ise; but the question is, what had we better do with her?"&#xD;
"Indeed, Sir, you ought to know best."&#xD;
"Well so I do Susan; still,-however-it will do no harm, to&#xD;
give me your opinion about it."&#xD;
"But Sir, indeed I hain't any; unless you let her sleep with me&#xD;
and give her to the kitchengirl to help her sweepin and scrubbin&#xD;
and runnin errands."&#xD;
Mr. Fox looked amazed :&#xD;
"Sweeping and scrubbing? he exclaimed, why Susan don't you&#xD;
know she is a&#xD;
"A what?" the servant inquired, when he stopped.&#xD;
But Mr. Fox would not tell. He feared to be ridiculed, if he&#xD;
hinted at the pretended high station of his ward. So he said:&#xD;
&#xD;
.       I-DOLORES.                     1 5&#xD;
"Nevermind; only I promised her father, not to let her serve, but&#xD;
bring her up a lady and give her a good education."&#xD;
Susan struggled between astonishment and indignation. The&#xD;
low and ignorant will pardon their superiors for possessing rank&#xD;
and wealth, but woe to their equal, who endeavors to better his con-&#xD;
dition and rise above their level-they will never pardon him. Su-&#xD;
san had in her way taken a likingfor the orphan; but the words&#xD;
of her master effectually destroyed it and at that moment she&#xD;
hated her. What! a little beggargirl to be taken, and flattered&#xD;
and caressed and be doted upon? No indeed, Susan at least would&#xD;
countenance no such proceedings and this-resolution became un-&#xD;
mistakably plain in her miens and words, as she replied.&#xD;
'An education? Who ever heard the like! I wonder how Mrs.&#xD;
Fox will fancy that."&#xD;
With these words Susan had evidently played a trump; for Mr.&#xD;
Fox winced and showed some hesitancy, when he said:&#xD;
"'Why shouldn't she fancy it? As a good christian she cannot&#xD;
but laud my good intentions."&#xD;
The girl said nothing, but plucked the corner of her apron; Mr.&#xD;
Fox however at once recollected, that, if Mrs. Fox did object,&#xD;
Susan surely was not the person, to whom he had to account for&#xD;
his actions; so he said With a good deal of resolution :&#xD;
"As I said before, the girl must be cared for. She needs Ygar-&#xD;
ments of all descriptions and until they can be procured, some of&#xD;
Lucy's dresses will answer. Don't you think, they'll fit, her"&#xD;
"They may, for all I know,tho' it's-hard to say, how Mrs. Fox&#xD;
will take it."&#xD;
Mr. Fox did not reply to this; but ignoring it, resumed :&#xD;
If I recollect right, the little room above the kitchen is unoc-&#xD;
cupied."&#xD;
"So it is Sir; but .&#xD;
"And it is furnished for a sleepingroom?"&#xD;
"There is a bed there and a washstand; but I guess".&#xD;
"Then it will answer, to put little Dolores in. I charge you,&#xD;
Susan, to see, that everything is done, to make her comfortable."&#xD;
Susan was sorely vexed and she couldn't for her life quit the&#xD;
room, without  showing it and making an attempt at rebelling&#xD;
against her master's orders. Past experience must have shown&#xD;
&#xD;

her the feasibility of such a conduct, or she would perhaps not&#xD;
have risked the experiment.&#xD;
hYou must excuse my gain saying Mr. Fox" she said, plucking&#xD;
her apron with greater zest than before and coloring a little-&#xD;
either from vexation or excitement "but it strikes me Sir, that&#xD;
Mrs. Fox will never give in to such an arrangement. She is look-&#xD;
ing for a second cook I heard her say and wants the room for her&#xD;
to put i"&#xD;
"She does ?" Mr. ox replied, well if that is the case,'we must&#xD;
not interfere. We cainput Dolores as well in the cornerroom above&#xD;
the parlor.&#xD;
"But that is a spareroom for visitors, and I heard Mrs. Fox say,&#xD;
as how she expected lots of friends soon."&#xD;
"Did she say so? Well then there is the little chamber next to&#xD;
mine; that is a cozy little room and not wanted, I am sure."&#xD;
At thi's suggestion Susan became still more excited. Letting her&#xD;
apron go and putting her hands on her hips in such a way,as to make&#xD;
her elbows stand out in the shape of a pair of squares, she cried :&#xD;
"Mr. Fox, you clout mean that, ? The best costliest, room in the&#xD;
whole house for this little brat of a beggar? Mrs. Fox will be de-&#xD;
lighted to see her silkspreads soiled by her dirty fingers."&#xD;
Mr. Fox received this new objection with a patience, showing&#xD;
that he possessed an unusual stock of that virtue. Having reflect-&#xD;
ed a while, he resumed:&#xD;
"You women are dreadfully particular, I know, and I count like&#xD;
to cross your arrangements, if I canhelp it. If all these roone&#xD;
dont answer, I know but one more and that is the closet next&#xD;
to Lucy's room. I looked in yesterday and noticed it to be just&#xD;
ready, to receive an inmate."&#xD;
Susan shook her head:&#xD;
"The Missus won't like a strange beggar child so near her darl-&#xD;
in' I am sure" she said "Nobody knows- what sort of a person&#xD;
she is and she might play all sorts of tricks on poor Lucy, before&#xD;
we'd know."&#xD;
This last argument was the best she had thus far advanced; but&#xD;
yet it irritated Mr. Fox and perhaps for that very reason. We&#xD;
are apt to get excited just in proportion to our antagonist's suc-&#xD;
cess in warding off our thrusts. So Susan accomplished by good&#xD;
sense, what she had failed to accomplish by nonsense, tho' surely&#xD;

. Nonl sense Susan!. I am gettingtired of your subterfuges and&#xD;

at once. Begone, I say and let me hear no more of this. If ifind&#xD;
that the child's comfort is neglected, I'll make you rue it. Dont&#xD;
stare at me and go."&#xD;
The reader will perceive that Mr. Fox had nicely worked Jiim-&#xD;
self into a rage. 'That is the way with many a timid man, though&#xD;
we are far from imputing cowardice to Mr. Fox,--&amp;amp; theywpn't&#xD;

inust go and hunt her up, for somehow, the little one hay bewitch-&#xD;
ed me with her deep sensible eyes and the quiet way, with which&#xD;
she bears her loss."&#xD;
Mr. Fox left the house and stepped into the park, but just as he&#xD;
was turning the corner of the house, the person he sought, came&#xD;
running towards him with every sign of- the greatest excitement.&#xD;
Her eyes were flashing fire, her little hands were clentehed and the&#xD;
lips firmly pressed together. Without heeding Mr. Fox, she'was&#xD;
on the point of hastening by him, when that gentleman with a&#xD;
voice expressing tenderness and surprise called her name.&#xD;
"Dolores! Little one ! what is the matterI"&#xD;
Now Mr. Fox had not at all, what we call a nusicaltvoice.lit&#xD;
was rather common; if not rough; but it isn't always the quality&#xD;
of the voice, that makes it find the way to the hearer's heart- it is&#xD;
the feeling, which dictates the words. Now Mr. Fox was one of&#xD;
the very few, who had ever spoken kindly to Dolores; moreover&#xD;
he had spoken kindly at the very moment, when she needed kind-&#xD;
n ess most and is it strange, that the image of her benefactor had&#xD;
engraved itself into her heart; that the tone of his voice fell pleas-&#xD;
antly on her ear? It failed not to affect her even in the state of&#xD;
feverish excitement, whose prey she was and stopping short in&#xD;
esponse to his call, she said with a flying voice-:&#xD;
"I want to go away, Sir. - Yoh are kind to me; but the others&#xD;
are not; your people sneer at me, whenever they look at me and&#xD;
that boy has struck me and called me a gipsy. I am no gipsy&#xD;
and I11 go away, where I need not hieawr it any more.&#xD;
good to me, Sir, and Dolores thanks you very much.  f&#xD;
After these words, that had been poured into the car of Mr.&#xD;
Fox with a rapidity, calculated to bewildet anybody, Dolores had&#xD;
stepped up to him and kissed his hand. Then turning, she&#xD;
again commenced her hasty flight, when another exclamation of&#xD;
his mouth stopped her a second time.&#xD;
"Dolores'!"&#xD;
This time, he spoke more tenderly yet and although surprise,&#xD;
was still manifest, his voice bore the character of reproach. The&#xD;
girl stopped at once, but she did not turn ; hanging her head and&#xD;
working her hands in a restless manner, she awaited his further&#xD;
ade went-upto her, and taking one of her hands into his cwn,&#xD;

led her to a part of the park, where dense undergrowth limited&#xD;
the view, but was also calculated to conceal the couple. No word&#xD;
was said on either side, until they reached a seat, overhung .b -&#xD;
flowering shrubs and climbing plants, a snug cozy place. Mr.&#xD;
Fox sat down and drew the girl to his side ; but neither of them&#xD;
noticed the beauty of the place.&#xD;
"Now, little one" Mr. Fox began "repeat to me what you said&#xD;
before ; but say it slowly; you perfectly drowned me before with&#xD;
your hurried charges."&#xD;
But by this time Dolores had cooled down a little and now felt&#xD;
the repugnance innate to noble natures, to play informer. She&#xD;
hesitated and stammered and it was only by dint of perseverance&#xD;
and numerous questions, that Mr. Fox.elicited the truth from her.&#xD;
It was this; while walking with Lucy in the park and garden she&#xD;
had suffered the rough contact with persons either ill disposed or&#xD;
void of sensibility, who, by their sneers and covert allusions or&#xD;
their uncouth sympathy equally deeply wounded her feelings.&#xD;
Still she had born it all and taken comfort from the even kind-&#xD;
ness and gentleness of her companion. She at least had done&#xD;
nothing to hurt her sensitive companion, though her calm and&#xD;
perhaps shallow nature had on the other hand also prevented her&#xD;
from making rapid advances to affection and intimacy. Then&#xD;
followed the scene, which had so deeply stirred the ire in the girl's&#xD;
bosom and whose very recital even now made her tremble with&#xD;
agitation. Walking on one of the roads, that wound through the&#xD;
,groves of the park, they had on a sharp bend suddenly come upon&#xD;
a boy, whom Lucy had addressed as her brother, but who with&#xD;
scornful laugh had declined all intercourse with a beggar brat.&#xD;
'To this word Dolores relunctantly confessed, insinuating shyly,&#xD;
that many others of a worse character had been used. However&#xD;
she had not borne them all with tame indifferent, but stepping&#xD;
boldly up to the young ruffian's face, had parried his thrusts&#xD;
with so much skill, that in his vexatious disappointment he had&#xD;
lowered himself to the mean act of striking a feeblesrkn  little girl.&#xD;
This act it was, that had made her temper run off with. her and&#xD;
would perhaps have driven her away from her protector's roof, if&#xD;
he had not opportunely intercepted her flight. He now sat sil-&#xD;
ently, no doubt deeply annoyed at the dishonorable course ofone,&#xD;

she told him with a cheering voice, that she did not mind it any&#xD;
longer and begged him, not to think about it any more.&#xD;
Fox was deeply touched by this display of generosity and the&#xD;
liking he had from the beginning felt for this little girl, fast ripen-&#xD;
ed into a warm affection. Drawing her closely to his side he said:.&#xD;
"Little one, I see, I have not wasted my fostering care upon an&#xD;
unworthy object. What I promised to your father from a feeling&#xD;
of christian duty, I now pledge to you from true and sincere af-&#xD;
fection. Will you in all respects, in the full sense of the word.&#xD;
be my dear and loving daughter?"&#xD;
The- child nestled closely to his side, her face assuming a happy&#xD;
expression and lovingly she whispered:&#xD;
"I will"&#xD;
"Well then, our compact has been duly made and ratified ; but&#xD;
Dolores, my power to protect you goes only a certain way. Of&#xD;
course, that booby of a boy shall no longer abuse you, nor the&#xD;
servants jeer you; but there is a-power to abuse, which being in-&#xD;
direct and only in tone and expression lies beyond my control and&#xD;
from which I cannot shelter you. Alas! poor child, many will be&#xD;
the instances, where the world jars upon a highstrung character&#xD;
and I would be false to my trust, to persuade you to the belief,.&#xD;
-       that such trial will be spared you in my house. Forewarned is&#xD;
forearmed and I want you from this present moment to form the&#xD;
resolution of meeting all such low attacks with calm indifference.&#xD;
Do you understand me Dolores?"&#xD;
"I think I do, Sir."&#xD;
"I knew you would. I knew from the first sight, that you were&#xD;
a little lady in every sense of the word and that induced me to be--&#xD;
friend you. Yes, my good girl, you will have many an unpleasant&#xD;
hour in this my house, from which even I cannot save you; but&#xD;
will you recollect at such periods, that I am and always shall be&#xD;
your true and sincere friend and father?"&#xD;
"I will Sir."&#xD;
And will you recollect, that I can perhaps protect you best,&#xD;
when I seem least disposed to do so? May be, I expect more of&#xD;
your penetration, than your years would warrant?"&#xD;
"No, Sir I know well, what you mean. Seeming to care but&#xD;
little about me,,yqu will make the others let me alone."&#xD;
Fox looked at the little creature with surprise.&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        21&#xD;
"God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb and gives cunning to&#xD;
the worm" he said earnestly. "Yes Dolores, I see you are prud-&#xD;
ent above your years and having hinted so much, I may as well go&#xD;
a step further. Mrs. Fox you know, my wife ... "&#xD;
He hesitated and the little girl noticing his embarrassment,&#xD;
hastened to reply:&#xD;
"Say nothing more, Mr. Fox. That naughty boy. I mean your&#xD;
son Richard, said something, that made me think, his mother&#xD;
would not be kind to me. I do not know, why it is; but I feel,&#xD;
that it will be so. Still I shall not mind it, Mr. Fox; or rather I&#xD;
shall try hard, to make her love me too, just for your sake, Mr.&#xD;
Fox and because you are so good to me."&#xD;
Tears started to his eyes. His affection for this little creature&#xD;
increased wonderfully and threatened to equal and outstrip the&#xD;
love he bore-to his own children. Richard often annoyed him by&#xD;
his numerous failings and Lucy, though a good child, was hardly&#xD;
bright and lively enough, to awaken strong affections even in a&#xD;
parent. In this child Fox had for the first time found his ideal&#xD;
realized and therefore involuntarily opened to her the fountains&#xD;
.of a heart, which he was perhaps often enough compelled to close&#xD;
up. His feeling was moreover increased by the readiness, with&#xD;
which Dolores adapted herself to circumstances and to say that he&#xD;
felt grateful for the indulgence, which she had promised to Mrs.&#xD;
Fox' caprices, would be stating the case but very feebly.  A&#xD;
load was taken off his mind and he began to look with different&#xD;
feelings towards the hour, that would bring back his wife. The&#xD;
.marriage of Mr. Fox and his lady were not exactly, what we term&#xD;
an unhappy one; but this was merely due to the husband's con-&#xD;
sideration, his easy disposition and the happy humor, with which&#xD;
he adapted himself to all her notions. If he had been as head-&#xD;
strong, as he was kind and tolerant, you term would have found'&#xD;
its application in its worst definition. As it was Mr. Fox yielded&#xD;
the point in almost every instance and the reader will therefore&#xD;
find Miss Susan's wonderment fully justified, when he for the first&#xD;
time in her experience showed proofs of a will of his own. But&#xD;
to return to the pair under the elderbush. Mr. Fox drew the girl&#xD;
tenderly to his heart and holding her in a firm embrace, said :&#xD;
"Dolores, my dear child, little did I dream, what treasure I should&#xD;
Receive in you, when I promised to your father, what christian&#xD;

charity compelled me to promise. I confess, I felt uneasy, when&#xD;
I thought of your first meeting with Mrs. Fox; but your assurance,&#xD;
fully eases my mind on that score. Perhaps our fears are un-&#xD;
grounded and she may for once pull evenly with me. Nor will IT&#xD;
advise you, how to behave to her; your own good sense will tell.&#xD;
you better, than words of mine could do.  And now let us part;&#xD;
it will be best from the beginning, if we avoid any show of great&#xD;
familiarity; but never for a moment forget, my child, that I love&#xD;
you dearly and always shall love you with unchanging fidelity.&#xD;
If any one should dare to annoy you beyond endurance, come to&#xD;
me at once, no matter from what party the annoyance comes. I&#xD;
shall stand by you on such occasions; but if they let you alone.&#xD;
and only now and then by word or look betray their littleness of&#xD;
soul-well, then let it go, my child; remember, that by resenting&#xD;
eveiy little annoyance, we would annoy ourselves more than our&#xD;
evil wishers and destroy that even tenor of our lives, which consti-&#xD;
tutes our happiness."&#xD;
Mr. Fox arose, still leading by the hand the little girl he had&#xD;
taken to the seat and yet a different creature. Graspi r g firmly&#xD;
the hand of her protector, she walked lieside him with a step, that&#xD;
hardly touched the ground. Fox noticed with satisfaction the;&#xD;
buoyancy of her spirits.&#xD;
"Dolores" lie began again "we had to talk so much that I for-&#xD;
got to ask, how you stand with Lucy?"&#xD;
«Oh! very well indeed ! She is so good and gentle ; I shall al-&#xD;
ways like her very much."&#xD;
"I am glad of it, for Lucy is really a good girl and will undoubt-&#xD;
edly return your affection."&#xD;
Dolores shook her head :&#xD;
"I don't know Sir, how that will be. Supposing, her mother-&#xD;
forbids her, to love me?"&#xD;
Fox was again startled at her keen perception of the situation..&#xD;
Still he smiled and said:&#xD;
"Love can neither be commanded nor forbidden, child., There-&#xD;
fore try to win the.love of Lucy and nobody can deprive you of it."-&#xD;
"But she may be forbidden to show her love."&#xD;
"That is true ; but we would nevertheless gain an ally to our,&#xD;
party and have so much more prospect- of a final victory."&#xD;
Dolores smiled. Near the house the two parted, and while the&#xD;
&#xD;
girl sought her foster sister, Mr. Fox turned his steps towards the&#xD;
stable, where lie was almost always sure to find his son. Richard&#xD;
loved horses better than books and understood the merits of-a&#xD;
racer better than those of a lecture. In town, during winter, Mr.&#xD;
Fox enforced a strict attendance to school of both his children&#xD;
and at first had even brought a governess to his country residence,&#xD;
to keep up, if not improve, their knowledge ; but Richard's conduct&#xD;
had always made her stay of short duration and as Mrs. Fo&#xD;
took his part and pretended, that studying in the heat of summer&#xD;
did not agree with her son, her husband had yielded for the sake&#xD;
of peace and lately allowed the children the whole summer for plav&#xD;
and recreation.&#xD;
On reaching the stable, lie found his boy engaged in an .eager&#xD;
conversation with John the coatchman. The subject seemed. to&#xD;
please the speaker and the listener equally well, for Mr. Fox heard&#xD;
frequent shouts of laughter and the name of "glipsy' repeatedly&#xD;
struck his ear.&#xD;
"Richard, step this way" lie said, "I want to speak to you."&#xD;
The boy, a lad of some 14 or 15 years, was a little startled .oi&#xD;
hearing his name so unexpectedly called; but turning around and&#xD;
recognizing his father, lie quickly regained his composure and re&#xD;
sliming his former position with his back towards Mr. Fox, lie&#xD;
answered:&#xD;
"I will after a while, I am just helping John a little."&#xD;
Now the boy had no doubt many a time disobeyed his father&#xD;
without apy manifest evil effects to himself; but if he expected to&#xD;
get off as well on this occasion, he was much mistaken. Before&#xD;
he was aware of it, his father's hand was on him, seizing him by&#xD;
the collar of his jacket and wheeling him with a vigor, that made&#xD;
him spin like a top, before he finally stopped, confronting the&#xD;
angry brow of his father. He was out of breath, but apparently&#xD;
more with surprise than with exercise. This energetic action of&#xD;
Mr. Fox was probably as strange to him, as another manifestation&#xD;
of it had been to Susan. Yes, so little could he realize it, that for&#xD;
a monient he took it for a joke and assuming an air of injured&#xD;
dignity, said with a brusque voice :&#xD;
"What do you mean, Sir?"&#xD;
"You are of very dull comprehension" Mr. Fox sternly replied&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;

DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
"and it is well for you, that I set down your impudence on account&#xD;
of your stupidity."&#xD;
The boy still stared at his father, but by this time he began to&#xD;
realize, that the whirl had been applied' in good earnest. John&#xD;
the coachman had also come to this conclusion and therefore re-&#xD;
treated to a safer distance; but having reached, what he considered&#xD;
a secure corner, he imitated his young master and with dilated&#xD;
eyes and mouth gave way to1his unqualified astonshment in the&#xD;
shape of a hopeless stare.&#xD;
"Still, I desire to be understood hereafter, sir" Mr. Fox resumed&#xD;
and therefore advise you to listen with due attention to what I&#xD;
have to say. If ever I hear of a repetition of the dastardly act&#xD;
against Dolores, of which you are guilty ; moreover, if in the least&#xD;
way, by word, look or act you dare to molest her, I shall punish&#xD;
you in a manner, that will make you rue the hour, when you took&#xD;
it into your head, to disregard your father's order. Did you un-&#xD;
derstand me, sir?"&#xD;
Sullen silence on the part of Master Richard. Making another&#xD;
step towards the boy, Mr. Fox repeated the question with a sharp-&#xD;
er tone.&#xD;
"I want to know, whether you understand me?,&#xD;
This time a morose "yes!" came from the boy's lips.&#xD;
"Very well, I am glad to know it and John, I want you to wit-&#xD;
ness his reply. He understands me. Now sir.begone! and don't&#xD;
appear before my eyes, until you have learned to know, that no&#xD;
true gentleman ever strikes a woman. Begone sir!"&#xD;
Stupified, but apparently cowed, the boy left the stable, and&#xD;
John, considering his corner no longer safe, was on the point of&#xD;
beating a retreat, when Mr. Fox' voice arrested him.&#xD;
"John !"&#xD;
"Yes Sir!" the response came quicker, and more respectfully&#xD;
than it had ever issued from the coachman's mouth and that in-&#xD;
dividual appeared before his master with an awkwardness, show-&#xD;
ing plainly, that his conscience was far from easy and that he did&#xD;
not know exactly, what was in store for him.&#xD;
"You have seen Dolores, the little girl, whose father died in this&#xD;
house yesterday ?"&#xD;
"Yes Sir!"&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
25&#xD;
&#xD;
"You know, that she is henceforth to be regarded and treated&#xD;
1ike a member of my family?"&#xD;
"Well, sure Sir, I didn't know exactly."&#xD;
."Mind it then, that such is the case. You have witnessed my&#xD;
order to Richard, regarding his conduct towards the girl; well&#xD;
what I forbid my children, I shall surely not allow my servants. I&#xD;
want you and all the rest to treat Dolores with due respect or in&#xD;
case of a contrary conduct be prepared to quit my service. Will&#xD;
you have the goodness, to communicate these matters to your&#xD;
comrades as well as the female servants of the house?"&#xD;
"Yes, Sir" was the reply of the perplexed coachman-&#xD;
"Thank you, John, that is all. I suppose you know that you&#xD;
have to drive to the depot this evening for Mrs. Fox? I expect&#xD;
her by the 6 o'clock train."&#xD;
"So the children tells me" John replied with returning assurance,&#xD;
feeling evidently like a, man, that has gone through a severe&#xD;
thunder storm, without being struck by the lightning. "I was jist&#xD;
gittin' ready, when yer Honor came in the stable."&#xD;
"Very well, start in time, you know Mrs. Fox dont like to be&#xD;
kept waiting."&#xD;
With these words, Mr. Fox returned to the house. He went to&#xD;
his room, but if he had gone into the basement instead, he could&#xD;
have witnessed a considerable excitement, produced by John's&#xD;
communications, which that worthy of course hastened to make&#xD;
without delay. le overdrew his master's passion, if anything' and&#xD;
delighted in frightening the servantgi rls by empathizing the strict-&#xD;
ness of the order. In this he was successful; for though they pre-&#xD;
tended to treat the whole matter very lightly, they were really&#xD;
frightened by the unexpected fierceness of a man, whom they had&#xD;
accustonied themselves to consider void of all elements calculated&#xD;
to produce such emotions. They all valued their places in his&#xD;
household ; for they were well treated and well paid, and therefore&#xD;
resolved to comply with his demands, as far as outward show was&#xD;
concerned. But though there were no communications on the&#xD;
subject among them, there was not a servant in that house that&#xD;
day, who did not secretly vow to him--or herself, that the beggar&#xD;
girl should pay for this.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
MAIN BATTLE.&#xD;
Supper was over. Mr. Fox was sitting in his armchair on the&#xD;
portico and tlhe two girls occupied a lounge in his neighborhood.&#xD;
He had missed Richard at the meal, but abstained from asking-&#xD;
questions, 'because he guessed the goy's whereabouts.  True,&#xD;
John had driven alone from the mansion; but Richard had-so&#xD;
thought his father-joined him on the*road, to be the first to see&#xD;
his mother and pour into her ear a colored story of every tding,&#xD;
thatshad transpired-in the house during her absence. His thoughts&#xD;
kept him silent and imitating his example, the girls also said but&#xD;
little and that little in a whisper: All at once the sound of wheels&#xD;
became audible on the road and a moment afterwards an open&#xD;
carriage drove up before the house. At the first sound Fox had&#xD;
arisen and in that position he awaited the arrival of his wife. There-&#xD;
she sat, richly attired, and at her side her son, thus verifying his&#xD;
father's supposition. His wife, then, knew everything and that&#xD;
perhaps was well; for it saved him the trouble of breaking the&#xD;
news to her and allowed him to act on the defensive in the con-&#xD;
flict, which. as he knew, was sure to come.&#xD;
When the carriage stopped, Lucy and he -'ather stood waiting&#xD;
at the door, to assist Mrs. Fox in alightin ,while Dolores had re-&#xD;
mained at the top of the stairs, secretly trembling at the thought&#xD;
of meeting the woman, whom she had good reason to consider the&#xD;
arbiter of her fate, the person, in whose power it lay, to make her&#xD;
happy or miserable.&#xD;
On reaching the groum d Mrs. Fox stooped to kiss her daughter,&#xD;
taking good care, not to derange her splendid toilet; then raising&#xD;
herself again she answered her husband's "good evening" and&#xD;
"welcome home" with a gracious nod and laying her glove hand&#xD;
into his extended right, vouchsafed to him a condescending smile.&#xD;
Mrs. Fox was a handsome woman, some might have .called her&#xD;
beautiful; but it was the beauty of the marble and like it cold.&#xD;
Even her smile would not light it up nor take from those large&#xD;
gray eyes the sharp stinging look, that made Dolores shrink when:&#xD;
they rapidly glanced over the house and for a moment dwelled on&#xD;
her figure. With stately bearing the Lady swept up the flight of&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        27&#xD;
stairs leading to the portico, refusing her husband's ,assistance&#xD;
and stepping on the platform with a mien, that seemed to say:.&#xD;
"this is my realm and I am queen of it !" Passing Dolores and&#xD;
pretending now to get the first sight of her, she stopped a mo-&#xD;
ment and said coldly :&#xD;
"Ah! whom have we here? I suppose that is the little girl, my&#xD;
son told me about. Edward have you already instructed Susan&#xD;
to assign her such duties in the servant's department, as willsuit&#xD;
her capacity ?"&#xD;
Mr. Fox hesitated a moment, before he answered. He had hard-&#xD;
ly expected that she would begin the battle so soon, or that she&#xD;
'would open it with a battery of such heavy, caliber.. Generally&#xD;
her tactics consisted in light skirmishes and ambuscades, from&#xD;
which she would fall upon angngarded point of his position, and&#xD;
capture him, before he was aware of it. This time she evidently&#xD;
preferred an open fight, perhaps provoked by the, magnitude ofhis&#xD;
offense. True, her face showed not the slightest evidence of vex-&#xD;
ation; but then Mr. Fox knew very well, that these placid features&#xD;
were not always a certain index to the feelings underneath; that;&#xD;
while the imouth could smile, a sea of rage could heave and surge&#xD;
and seathe below the glassy surface. It might be so this time&#xD;
and Mr. Fox was inclined to consider this rather fortunate; for an&#xD;
excited fOe rarely resorts to feints and wiles and false attacks. At&#xD;
any rate, he was resolved to meet the issue fairly and squarely and&#xD;
knowing the .danger of yielding the slightest point,,replied.&#xD;
"I have not, Caroline; nor is it my intention to do it at all."&#xD;
"Well, there you are right," she answered with a smile "this is&#xD;
properly my province and I shall attend to it. Here my little.girl;&#xD;
I11 give you a chance of showing your docility; take these things&#xD;
of mine and put them on the rack.'&#xD;
Dolores with a willing hand stepped forward, to do the lady's&#xD;
bidding, but the voice of Mr. Fox at;once arrested her.&#xD;
"Stop a moment Dolores" he said with his face slightly coloring&#xD;
up you are hardly strong and skilled enough for this and might&#xD;
drop the shawl. There is Susan coming, who can do the job a&#xD;
great deal better- Susan take your Mistress' things and put them&#xD;
away."&#xD;
"You haven't had your supper yet, Caroline, have you?"&#xD;
So sir," his wife replied, biting her lip, but in no other way-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7070-00000015"/>&#xD;
showing herself vexed at the manoeuver, with which he had par.&#xD;
ried her thrust "I haven't had anything worth speaking of, since&#xD;
we left the city this morning."&#xD;
"Well you had better have a bite then, before you change your&#xD;
dress. I ordered Susan to have supper ready for you." -&#xD;
"Thank you Sir" Mrs. Fox replied and in his company and that&#xD;
of her children, descended into the diningroom. There she seated&#xD;
herself at the table in company of her son, who for the sake of&#xD;
meeting her, or may be for other reasons, had foregone his supper.&#xD;
"Poor boy!" his mother said caressingly "missed his supper for&#xD;
mother's sake. Well it will now taste doubly good in my coin-&#xD;
pany."&#xD;
Susan had brought tea and was going to serve at the table, when&#xD;
Mrs. Fox interrupted her.&#xD;
"Susan" she said "you must be very busy and I hate to impose&#xD;
on you. Supposing you go on with your work and send me the&#xD;
little girl from the porch This surely is an easy task and she may&#xD;
as well relieve you of this extra labor. I am not hard to please,&#xD;
and if she is not perfect all at once, she certainly will do better&#xD;
after a while."&#xD;
Susan spoke her "yes nia'm" with a slight embarrassment, cast-&#xD;
ing a furtive glance at her master,' before she turned to go. Be-&#xD;
fore she reached the door his voice stopped her :&#xD;
"Susan" he said with a laugh "I am afraid Dolores would make&#xD;
a batch of it. You better leave her where she is and, if you are&#xD;
really busy elsewhere, Lucy and I will do the waiting. My little&#xD;
girl will certainly delight in serving upon her mother."&#xD;
This was said so definitely, though in a pleasant manner, that&#xD;
Susan dared not disregard it; but with her stereotyped "Yes,&#xD;
Sir" left the room, without any other comfort than the exchange&#xD;
of a significant look with her mistress.&#xD;
That Lady was evidently the prey of unpleasant sensations.&#xD;
Twice in the period of half an hour she had been foiled and con-&#xD;
tradicted by a husband, on whose record such things were entirely&#xD;
unknown. . True, Richard had faithfully chronicled the astound-&#xD;
ing display of energy, which Mr. Fox had lately been guilty of;&#xD;
but that was to children and servants. She doubted not, that the&#xD;
very sight of her!would suffice, to crush in the bud the, struggle&#xD;
for independance, her husband seemed inclined to make. His&#xD;
&#xD;
downright contradiction therefore on two occasions and the ready&#xD;
obedience he found with the servants, at once irritated and al-&#xD;
armed her. Yet his opposition to her wishes had been so consid-&#xD;
erate, so entirely in the limits of politeness and good breeding,&#xD;
that she was deprived of any chance whatever of putting in the&#xD;
powerful levers with which she had. always carried her point. She&#xD;
was still uncertain as to the best course to pursue,.when Mr. Fox&#xD;
changed his tactics and benefiting by the advantage he had gained,&#xD;
assumed the offensive.&#xD;
"Caroline" he said as quietly and politely as lie could "the ser-&#xD;
vants being absent, Imay as well seize the opportunity of rectify-&#xD;
ing an error, under which you seem to labor in regard to thi3 lit-&#xD;
tle girl. , I thought Richard had already explained her case"-&#xD;
Mr. Fox looked sharply tt the boy, who dropped his eyes and&#xD;
blushed under. his gaze-"but it seems I have been mistaken&#xD;
and have therefore to enlighten you respecting her case. Her&#xD;
father, who died yesterday under this roof, exacted a promise from&#xD;
me, to take care of the child and to educate her in a manner be-&#xD;
coming her position."&#xD;
Here Mr. Fox hesita   a little. He probably felt, that from &#xD;
prudent, worldly point of view, he had given a rather hasty pledge&#xD;
and that by the adherence to it, he would expose himself to the&#xD;
ridicule of the scoffers. Mrs. Fox saw her advantage and feign-&#xD;
ing an unbounded surprise, exclaimed:&#xD;
"But Mr. Fox, I am at a loosto comprehend this. Can it barely&#xD;
be possible, that you, the experienced business man, should have&#xD;
suffered yourself, to be imposed upon ? Position indeed! pray&#xD;
what rank does this protege of yours hold?"&#xD;
Mr. Fox slightly colored. This was another weak point of his&#xD;
case and lie felt the keen reluctance of the republican, to appear&#xD;
captivated by the lustre of rank and station. For that reason he&#xD;
merely replied :&#xD;
"Her father left me papers, proving that she belongs to one of&#xD;
the first noble, families of Italy"&#xD;
Ms. Fox laughed, but if she could have heard, how ugly that&#xD;
laughter sounded, she would have been less prone to indulge in&#xD;
her merriment.&#xD;
,'Noble families indeed !" she sneered "pray, if her father was&#xD;
of such high rank, why did he beg his bread in the streets ?"&#xD;

30                    DOLORES.&#xD;
In niakingthis inquiry, Mrs. Fox betrayed a knowledge, which&#xD;
she had formerly denied. But this slight inconsistancy escaped&#xD;
observation in the ardor of the fight and without alluding to it Mr.&#xD;
Fox replied :&#xD;
Becausedhe joined a-conspiracy against the house of Austria&#xD;
and on discovery had to flee for his life."&#xD;
Another outburst of merriment, holding the middle between a&#xD;
laugh and a sneer.&#xD;
"The old story of the political refugee ! I must confess, I have&#xD;
never yet seen an Italian, who was not at least a duke and had&#xD;
not taken part in some dreadful conspiracy."&#xD;
Mr. Fox remained silent. He felt; that he lost ground and his'&#xD;
wife seing her advantage, was not slow, to follow it up.&#xD;
"Indeed Mr. Fox, I am not only perfectly thunderstruck at the&#xD;
credulity, with which you have fallen a prey to the machinations&#xD;
of these people. I should have expected more of one of your&#xD;
experience.''&#xD;
Mr. Fox got somewhat nettled at these taunts.&#xD;
"You show little charity, Mrs. Fox, in excluding from your&#xD;
explanations even the possibility of the poor fellow's honesty.&#xD;
A hemorrhage is generally no trick in'the. role of imposters and&#xD;
people are apt to speak the truth, when they seal their statements&#xD;
with their death."&#xD;
There was no gainsaying this and Mrs. Fox knew it and there-&#xD;
foie changed her front.&#xD;
"Even admitting, that the man was honest," she argued, being&#xD;
careful to preserve a show of fairness in word and expression,&#xD;
A"was it not inconsiderate in you-to make the promise?"&#xD;
"Not to my knowledge, madam."&#xD;
"Well then, let me explain. It was not tiy considerate;to im-&#xD;
pose a new burden on me, without consulting my wishes."&#xD;
"I gvas not aware, that you were a heavily burdened woman. If&#xD;
vou want more help, a word will suffice to procure it.&#xD;
"It isn't help I want, sir. Help cannot do everything. If I&#xD;
were to act the mother to this girl, a hundred duties would arise,&#xD;
which I could not shift upon other shoulders. But that is not ail.&#xD;
You were even more inconsiderate to the girl than to your wife, in.&#xD;
making that promise.'&#xD;

"Indeed I do not; nothing can be plainer. You agreed to raise&#xD;
this little girl a lady and when you have done so, what is to become&#xD;
of her? Do you intend to shorten your own children's inheritance,&#xD;
by bestowing upon the stranger's girl a fortune, that will enable&#xD;
her, to live in conformity with her education ? Or will you cast&#xD;
her oil; after having given her a taste for enjoyments, which will&#xD;
never be hers ? That is not only inconsideratenessiso&#xD;
right cruelty."&#xD;
Mr. Fox felt the force of these objections; but he also felt, that&#xD;
they covered the extreme limits of the case. Moreover he felt,&#xD;
that his wife reasoned very cleverly at the expence of her feelings.&#xD;
and that in doing a good deed it will never do to contemplate&#xD;
distant unfavorable possibilities and thus suffer ourselves to be&#xD;
prevented from executing it. Lastly however all this fine reason-&#xD;
ings were totally useless and unseasonable, because not only by&#xD;
his word, but even by his oath he was pledged to the fulfillment&#xD;
of his promise. 'Ihis he intemated to his wife in plain words,&#xD;
begging her to receive the case as a fixed fact and to accomodat&#xD;
herself to circumstances, which it was out of his power to alter.&#xD;
But if he had expectated a ready compliance to this request, he&#xD;
tas evidently.nuch mistaken. Mrs. Fox not only refused to yield&#xD;
point, but seeing, that calm reasoning would fail to answer,&#xD;
she at once entered the field with declamations and protesttions,&#xD;
with tears and lamentationsin short with all the powerful weep-&#xD;
ons at the disposal of the female sex.&#xD;
"So you really mean to say, Edward, that you will adhere to&#xD;
this foolish project ?"&#xD;
"Why Caroline you are too good a christian to desire, that I&#xD;
should perjure myself."&#xD;
"That, Sir, you have to settle with your conscience. It wasn't&#xD;
I who advised such silly pledges, and you can surely not expt&#xD;
that I should consider myself bound by your vows ?"&#xD;
"I do expect, that you will respect them and do&#xD;
terferewith their fulfilment." .&#xD;
"But what am I to do with this beggar child? You do not ex-&#xD;
Pect, that I nd y children shall associate with her on terms of&#xD;
equality  ?"whe                              her mli f&#xD;

my house a burden. As to the rest, I shall take everything upon&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
"And this creature, this beggar girl is to be about me, a foreign&#xD;
element, to interfere with my designs, destroy my comfort and&#xD;
spy my actions? No, Sir, I shall never- consent to such an ar-&#xD;
rangement, and I warn you from the first that I'shall do all in&#xD;
my power, to rid myself of this girl, whom I cannot see in any&#xD;
other light, then that of an intruder and annoyance."&#xD;
With these words Mrs. Fox arose anid sweeping with the dig-&#xD;
nity of an offended queen across the room; had reached the door,&#xD;
when her husband bade her stop a moment.&#xD;
"Caroline" he said, I hope you will think better of this after&#xD;
calm reflexion ; but if you should not; if you should insist upon&#xD;
crossing my wishes in this respect, I hope you will at least limit&#xD;
your opposition to passive resistance. Any direct interference&#xD;
with my orders, any 'ttempt'to incite my' children or servants to&#xD;
a rebellion against my dispositions, will compel me to use my&#xD;
rights and powers as the master of this houst. You know I hate&#xD;
disputes and you can easily avoid them. Let me hope then, that&#xD;
this disagreable subject will never be revived, betwee ius."&#xD;
hirs. Fox  disdained to reply; she hardly awaited the end of his&#xD;
remarks, but leaving the room an-slamming the door with un-&#xD;
ladylike vehemence, went upstairs and retiring to her room, be-&#xD;
came invisible for the balance of the night. Her children how-&#xD;
ever were summoned to her presence, to receive instructions; but&#xD;
while LucY was merely strictly forbidden to have anything to do.&#xD;
with the "beggar girl," her son was taken into her more intimate&#xD;
confidence. He remained closeted with her for quite a length of&#xD;
time and when he reappeared it was with a malignant joy on his&#xD;
face and 'a triumphant scowl, which he hardly thought necessary&#xD;
to conceal.&#xD;
Mr. Fox was the last, to leave the diningroom. He ascended&#xD;
the stairs with a heavy heart and when he stepped on the portico,&#xD;
where Dolores had been waiting in painful suspense, a deep sigh'&#xD;
betrayed her at once that the interview had not furthered her in-&#xD;
terests. Mr. Fox laid his handon her head, but he said nothing&#xD;
and with a vacant eye stared in the air. Only when Dolores&#xD;
caught his other hand and caressingly laid it against her cheek,&#xD;
he looked down upon her with a mournful smile, saying merely.:&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        33&#xD;
"Poor child!"&#xD;
Mrs. Fox don't like me "Dolores asked shvly."&#xD;
He shook his head.&#xD;
"She hates me very much."&#xD;
"Oh I do not think she does; at least she did not say so."&#xD;
"But she does not want me in the house ?"&#xD;
"It is hard to say, child, what she wants, he answered with a&#xD;
shade of vexation, in his tone ; hardly remembering to whom he&#xD;
spoke.&#xD;
After a while Dolores resumed -&#xD;
"It will make you miserable, Mr. Fox, to have her be angry&#xD;
with you?"&#xD;
Mr. Fox started and looked troubled.&#xD;
"I hardly know, child, for I am used to it. Trit I try to avoid&#xD;
such things, but if they can't be helped they have to be borne."&#xD;
"But they might be helped" Dolores suggested.&#xD;
He looked up in surprise.&#xD;
"How child?" he asked abruptly.&#xD;
"If you sent me away" she said, dropping her head and speak-&#xD;
ing so softly, that he could hardly hear her.&#xD;
He was deeply moved at such self denial. Drawing her into his&#xD;
embrace and kissing her forehead, he said quickly and with deci-&#xD;
sion:&#xD;
"Do not mention it again, for it is out of question. You are&#xD;
worth a dozen of her and at such a prize I will not purchase&#xD;
peace."&#xD;
Releasing her and taking a chair he mused a while and then re-&#xD;
sumed:&#xD;
"But I am selfish Dolores; I forgot that you must suffer more&#xD;
in such a fend than I."&#xD;
She shook her head:&#xD;
"I shall be sorry to displease her" she said,, but then I know,&#xD;
that you love me and that will make me not mind it."&#xD;
"Are you sure of that Dolores?"&#xD;
'Very sure."&#xD;
"Well then, let us weather it, as well as we can. If she refuses&#xD;
to be a mother to you, I'll have to be both father and mother&#xD;
that's all. Come child; it is late and I must see whether Suan&#xD;
has done my bidding and prepared you a room to sleep in."&#xD;

Taking her hand, he led her into the basement, where Susan&#xD;
was still busy washing dishes and making preparations for to mor-&#xD;
row's breakfast.&#xD;
"Is the room ready I ordered Susan ?"&#xD;
"Yes Sir."&#xD;
"Show us to it, then."&#xD;
Susan led them up a pair of back stairs and opened the door of&#xD;
the room above the kitchen, about which she had made so much&#xD;
fuss a few hours ago.&#xD;
"That will do, Susan, you may go."&#xD;
"Shan't I assist the miss, to undress ?"&#xD;
Before Mr. Fox could reply, Dolores said in a pleasant way :&#xD;
"Thank you Susan, I can do very well alone. I thank you for&#xD;
fixing this room so nicely for me."&#xD;
If Susan appreciated her thanks, she did not show it; but leav-&#xD;
ing the room returned to her sphere of business.&#xD;
"And you really want no help Dolores ?"&#xD;
"Indeed, Mr. Fox, I do not, since my mother's death I had no-&#xD;
body to assist me and then you know, if I had had help, why it&#xD;
wouldn't have done me any good, because I had no clothes to&#xD;
change."&#xD;
This was said half sadly osnd half jokingly; but Mr. Fox was&#xD;
more affected by the sadness, than the joke; so he said:&#xD;
"Poor little one ! Clothes shall never fail you again if I can&#xD;
help it, nor help either, if you need it. Still if you can get along&#xD;
alone, it will be so much the better and spare Susan's dignity.&#xD;
There is a great deal in management and I am sure, my little&#xD;
Dolores will know how to manage."&#xD;
"I hope I shall, sir ; at least I shall try very hard, to make them&#xD;
love me."&#xD;
"They must be monsters, if you do not succeed at last. But&#xD;
now good night Dolores; I shall wait outside, until you are in&#xD;
bed."&#xD;
He took her hand and when she held up her little face to him,&#xD;
pressed a tender kiss upon her lips. Poor thing! perhaps it had&#xD;
been her habit to offer that tribute of affection to her father and&#xD;
now in the yearning for love, so general in children, she bestowed&#xD;
it upon the man, who had given her parent a decent burial and&#xD;
shown her more kindness, than she could recollect to have receiv-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       35&#xD;
'ed on her whole dreary journey through life. Then Mr. Fox left&#xD;
the room, and patiently stood sentinel at the door, until Dolores&#xD;
'voice informed him, that she had safely reached the haven, in&#xD;
which she was to anchor for the night, a bed more comfortable&#xD;
-and tidy, than she had seen in all her past experience.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
CONQUEST.&#xD;
The next morning, at break of day, when Susan was kindling a&#xD;
fire in the range, a light hand was laid upon her shoulder and a&#xD;
childish voice inquired:&#xD;
"Susan may I help you?"&#xD;
The girl started and looking up saw Dolores, who being washed&#xD;
and combed and attired in a plain calico dress and a white apron,&#xD;
offered as pretty a picture as one would want to see. Her head&#xD;
was bent a little, to catch Susan's eye, while from her own eman-&#xD;
ated a flood of genuine kindness, truly captivating. For a mo-&#xD;
ment Susan was captivated; but recollecting, that such a speedy&#xD;
and unconditional surrender would be disgraceful and altogether&#xD;
humiliating she checked the kind reply already upon her lips and&#xD;
.said rather sharply :&#xD;
"Is that you? What do you want here in the kitchen ?"&#xD;
"I want to help you Susan. Do let me."&#xD;
"Nonsense ! It won't ho for so fine a lady, to soil her fingers.&#xD;
Didn't Mr. Fox tell me plain enough, he didn't want you to work?"&#xD;
"Mr. Fox meant kindly- I think he promised my dear father,&#xD;
(her eye swam in tears at the mention) to be kind to me and to&#xD;
teach me to read and write and learn all sorts of things. But I&#xD;
think, he didn't mean, I shouldn't work at all; only I shouldn't&#xD;
work all the time, but learn a bit every day."&#xD;
"I don't know what he meant ; but I know what he said."&#xD;
"O Susan do let me help you; I love to work, so very much and&#xD;
you will see, I am not quite so stupid as you think me. I can&#xD;
make the coffee and toast bread and spread the table and wash the&#xD;
dishes and do a great many things beside, if you would only let&#xD;
me."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7070-00000019"/>&#xD;

&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
Susan-was considerably worried. She was naturally a well dis--&#xD;
posed person, though somewhat rough and the genuine loveliness&#xD;
of the little stranger stole irresistably into her heart. Yet she re--&#xD;
sisted stoutly and the recollection of this little beggar having&#xD;
been exalted high above her, as yet sustained her. Still her voice&#xD;
had not longer its former roughness, when she said:&#xD;
"Listen to the child ! I wonder, where you learned all the&#xD;
things you mentioned; may be on the street?"&#xD;
Dolores colored and was evidently hurt by the blunt allusion to&#xD;
her former wretched condition; but she had a purpose, the pur-&#xD;
pose, of conquering these ungenial spirits and with a control&#xD;
above her years she suppressed her feelings and replied:&#xD;
"Oh Susan, we were not always on the street. Some years ago&#xD;
when my father's health was better and my mother living, we fared:-&#xD;
better and had a little home and then it was I helped my dear ma&#xD;
for she was feeble and after a while got sick and grew worse and&#xD;
worse, until at last, she died and we had to put her in a coffin, like&#xD;
that of poor father. After that he also got sick and too feeble to&#xD;
work and so he bought the organ with the last money he had&#xD;
and-and-"&#xD;
Dolores' voice was completely drowned in the tears, that now&#xD;
streamed down her cheeks in a torrent, though evidently against&#xD;
her wish. She struggled hard to suppress them and after a while&#xD;
succeeded. The cloud passed from her face and she smiled with&#xD;
double sweetness through the moisture that still filled her eyes.&#xD;
Susan was more moved than ever. These tears annoyed her&#xD;
very much and tho' unwilling to comfort the girl, she thought she,&#xD;
could at least do no less, than grant the request, which original&#xD;
denial had provoked them.&#xD;
"Well, well".she said abruptly "don't cry: what is the use of&#xD;
it? If you are bound to dirty your hands and clothes, you may&#xD;
work, for what I care. But if the master scolds, I hope you will-&#xD;
recollect, that it wasn't any of my doings and that you forced me&#xD;
into it."&#xD;
Dolores' eyes brightened visibly. Clasping her hands she said:&#xD;
"Oh you are so good Susan, and [ shall love you for it. I know&#xD;
you dont like, me, Susan and have made up your mind, not to&#xD;
either. But Susan I shall be so good so very good to you, that&#xD;
I'll make you nevertheless."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        37&#xD;
A- queer sensation crept over Susan's heart. What could it&#xD;
mean ? Was this little girl to make a fool of her, as she had of&#xD;
Mr. Fox? It would never do, no never; therefore she put an end&#xD;
to this dangerous conversation, by saying:&#xD;
"Law me, child, what do you talk about. What has put such&#xD;
strange notions into your head? Come, come I han't no time to&#xD;
dispute with you any longer. Here is the coffee and there is the&#xD;
mill; you may grind away and I'll soon see, what stuff you are&#xD;
made of."&#xD;
The coffee was ground and the table setfor the servants, who&#xD;
.had their meal much earlier than the family. When every thing&#xD;
was ready, John and Jim came in and Jane the cook and they i-&#xD;
valled i staringat the little girl and wondering, what her presence&#xD;
meant. But they were soon to learn; for after they had seated&#xD;
.themselves, Dolores bade Susan sit down and on refusal forced&#xD;
her on a chair in a pleasant, flattering way, that was irresistible.&#xD;
That much accomplished, the child fetched the big coffee pot,&#xD;
so big, that she had to take both her hands to hold it, and then&#xD;
poured the brown aromatic beverage into their cups and fetched&#xD;
them milk and sugar and bread, and her rapid eager eye discover-&#xD;
ed every want, before it had made itself even felt. At first they&#xD;
,did not know, what to say and sat in rather an awkward silence;&#xD;
but Dolores understood how to jnake them speak. She asked&#xD;
them questions and made remarks bearing upon their different&#xD;
-occupations, showing a familiarity therewith, that made them&#xD;
wonder. But she succeeded at the same time in dispelling their&#xD;
embarrassment and before they knew it, the men and women were&#xD;
in a lively conversation with her and with each other and jokes&#xD;
and railleries were taken and given and before the meal was over,&#xD;
ohn declared she was a little beauty and Jim pretented that her&#xD;
smile made the coffee sweeter than any sugar. Even the women&#xD;
had lost their prejudices and made up their mind, to accept the&#xD;
little stranger and her position in the house in good grace. Their&#xD;
.faces told Dolores, tho' their lips did not and in consequence her&#xD;
eyes got brighter and her smile sweeter and she felt as if she could&#xD;
dance and embrace the whole company one and all.&#xD;
At this junction of the affair Susan gave a start and grew slight-&#xD;
pale, for she had looked through the half open door and seen&#xD;
itui master s face'. But he didn't at all look anry in the con-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7070-00000020"/>&#xD;
38                     DOLORES.&#xD;
trary, a gay smile rested on his features and he warned Susan, by&#xD;
raising his finger not to betray his presence and then vanished&#xD;
before the others had noticed him. When the meal was over,&#xD;
Dolores would not rest, until Susan had supplied her with a large&#xD;
coarse apron, to save her clothes and then allowed her, to dry the&#xD;
dishes, as they came out of the pan. Only when everything was&#xD;
finished and all the traces of the meal had been removed, she&#xD;
would consent to go up stairs. Stepping on the portico, she saw&#xD;
Mr. Fox and running up to him, bade him a good morning. He&#xD;
replied in warm tones and then by questions that seemed unpre-&#xD;
metiated, elicited from the child a recital of her recent achieve-&#xD;
ment. She was evidently proud of it and he was careful not to&#xD;
check her ardor. With some children a dangerous familiarity&#xD;
with coarse characters might have resulted from such a begin-&#xD;
ing; but somehow Mr. Fox had no fear of this in the case of Dol-&#xD;
ores. She had thus far acted. with so much propriety, that her-&#xD;
protector could not find the heart, to blame or even advise her.&#xD;
He abandoned her to that instinct of propriety, which seemed to&#xD;
innate to her and this was well. Moreover he rejoiced at the good&#xD;
impression which she had made upon the servants ; for he well&#xD;
knew, how much even the subordinate members of a household&#xD;
can contribute to a person's happiness or misery. If the servant's&#xD;
loved his little foster-daughter, Mrs. Fox would in a great mea-&#xD;
sure be deprived of the means of annoying her. Lucy's gentle-&#xD;
ness disqualified her naturally for any agency in such an attempt&#xD;
and the hostile forces were therefore reduced to his wife and&#xD;
Richard; for Mr. Fox knew his boy well enough, to feel sure that&#xD;
he would not only second his mother in any measure against Dol-&#xD;
ores, but even delight in anything, that required craft and cun-&#xD;
ning for its execution.&#xD;
Shortly afterwards, Richard and Lucy joined the pair on the&#xD;
portico. They both offered their "good morning ;" but.after that,&#xD;
the boy abstained from taking the slightest notice of Dolores.&#xD;
Lucy behaved with her usual gentleness; but she labored under a.&#xD;
constraint, that was evidently inspired. Mr. Fox said nothing.&#xD;
He knew well, that interference would make matters only worse,,&#xD;
and therefore allowed both his children, to conduct themselves&#xD;
towards Dolores as they pleased, provided they abstained from&#xD;
any direct attempts to insult her or hurt her feelings.&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        39&#xD;
The bell rang and called the party into the dining room, where&#xD;
a tempting breakfast was set for them. Mrs- Fox sent word that&#xD;
she would not be present, pleading fatigue from yesterday's jour-&#xD;
ney as an excuse. Nobody, but Richard seemed to regret this.&#xD;
annoi ncement, and he perhaps only because he felt the want of a&#xD;
congenial spirit. On the contrary, the tone of the conversation&#xD;
was gay and lively and even Susan seemed infected by the general&#xD;
hilarity. Mr. Fox saw with pleasure, that she waited upon no-&#xD;
body with more satisfaction, than upon Dolores and always help-&#xD;
ed her to the best of everything, without seeming, to have the in-&#xD;
tention of doing so.&#xD;
When breakfast was over, Mr. Fox announced his intention to&#xD;
take a walk to the factory and invited the children to accompany&#xD;
him. Richard alleged that his mother would want him and beg-&#xD;
ged to be excused; bit Lucy after some hesitation consented to&#xD;
join them. Leaving the park, the trio took the highway on the&#xD;
right, passing through common but nevertheless pretty scenery'&#xD;
On the right the park stretched nearly all the way to the works,&#xD;
and on the left it was lined with little cottages, as before said,&#xD;
with only here and there an opening of an acre or two'"between&#xD;
them. As they approached the last house, which had quite a&#xD;
number of handsome shade trees around it and in its architecture&#xD;
and surroundings showed more than ordinary taste, they saw a&#xD;
woman sitting at the window, on observing the party, greeted&#xD;
them friendly and came to the door, insisted upon a short stop at&#xD;
her house. She was so urgent in her invitation that Mr. Fox could&#xD;
not well decline ; he therefore directed his companions to stop a&#xD;
little while and opening the gate of the fence advanced towards&#xD;
the house, to salute the hostess.&#xD;
"How do you do Mrs. Fuchs?" he said shaking hands with the&#xD;
dame. who was about 40 years of age, but had withstood the tooth&#xD;
of time very well, showing an embonpoint indicative of a surplus&#xD;
of health "how do you do, Madam and how do your worthy hus.&#xD;
band and the boys fare ?"&#xD;
"The boys are very well, Sir, thank you" the hostess replied&#xD;
with a strong german accent reversing Mr. Fox' questions in her&#xD;
reply. Mr. Fuchs works as usual in the factory, and as to myself&#xD;
why I cannot complain, only sometimes I think, I get a little old&#xD;
ind frail."&#xD;

"Frail Madam?" Mr. Fox replied: "Why you aihe as stout as&#xD;
ever and will undoubtedly remain so for 50 years to come."&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs laughed and begged her company to be seated,&#xD;
which they refused to do, alleging a lack of time, to indulge in&#xD;
anything besides the meditated call at the factory.&#xD;
"Oh! you must stay long enough, to taste a glass of Rhine wine,&#xD;
my brother-in-law sent os from the old country" the hostess re-&#xD;
plied with an earnestness, that would brook no contradiction&#xD;
"just sit down on the porch; I'll be back in less than no time."&#xD;
Suiting the actions to the words, she disappeared, but shortly&#xD;
afterwards returned with some glasses and a bottle of wine, which&#xD;
all her guests had to partake of, before she would be satisfied.&#xD;
Mr. Fox praised the wine, as it well deserved; for it was of the best,&#xD;
the famous Rhine produces and had been sent by a relative living&#xD;
at the source. Then he once more asserted the necessity of con-&#xD;
tinuing their walk;. but the hostess was.evidently bound to pro-&#xD;
long the visit.&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Fox" she said "you are always in a great hurry. I&#xD;
havn't had time yet to look at these little ladies. This' here is&#xD;
Miss Lucy, I know, and growing fast too; -but whom have we&#xD;
here? Is this the little guest staying at the mansion?"&#xD;
"Yes Mrs. Fuchs and I seize, this opportunity, to recommend&#xD;
her to your favor."&#xD;
"She is welcome, indeed she is" the hostess said with a genuine&#xD;
kindness, that could not well be mistaken, at the same time seiz-&#xD;
ing the girl's hand and giving it a firm pressure. "I hope she&#xD;
will often ,call to see me and stay longer than Mr. Fox is willing&#xD;
to do. But there are my boys. Charles ! Henry ! come and pay&#xD;
your respects to Mr. Fox."&#xD;
Two boys about 16 and 14 years of age presented themselves&#xD;
before the party, to do their' mother's bidding. - They were both&#xD;
handsome, clever looking boys, especially the older, who had a&#xD;
certain something about his person, which we sometimes but rare-&#xD;
ly find in strangers, and which attracts us powerfully from the&#xD;
first. He was tall for his age possessing a body, evidently strong&#xD;
and wellknit, yet by no means void of that grace which is seldom&#xD;
matched with robustness and strength. When he took of his&#xD;
straw hat, he showed a high and commanding forehead; but though&#xD;
a pleasant smile seemed to .play habitually around his lips, a&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                 41&#xD;
&#xD;
thoughtful earnestness was stamped on his upper face. His hair&#xD;
and eyes were of an auburn color and the latter of a brightness,&#xD;
which in moments of excitement must certainly assume a start-&#xD;
ling brilliancy. -Altogether the youth was of an. extraordinary&#xD;
character and this Dolores, seemed to feel, for her eye dwelled&#xD;
long and earnestly upon him and when she shook hands with him&#xD;
she blushed and dropped her eye before his keen and searching&#xD;
glance.&#xD;
Henry, the younger boy, was no less attractive in his way. He&#xD;
had not the striking appearance of his brother, but in the eye of&#xD;
some was more handsome. His beauty was not of an intellectual&#xD;
character however and in the eye Dolores his glossy hair, smooth&#xD;
skin and fair color were no compensation for his brother's ap-&#xD;
pearance of superior intellect. Not that Henry had looked any,&#xD;
way's dull; but his lively eyes lacked steadiness, wandering here&#xD;
and there with restless vivacity and creating involuntarely the&#xD;
impression in the observing mind, that his purpose was as un.&#xD;
steady as his glance.&#xD;
Charles was evidently one of Mr. Fox' fovorites ; for he shook&#xD;
hands with him with great cordiality and inquired about his&#xD;
loings. Before the boy could answer, his mother replied in his&#xD;
stead.&#xD;
"Mr. Fox, excuse me for interrupting you; but I'll he honest&#xD;
and confess, that I had my little side reason for calling you in&#xD;
to-day and for trespassing on your precious time. It is my boys&#xD;
I wanted to speak to you about and if these young ladies will go&#xD;
a moment with then and allow them to show them the garden&#xD;
and their pets and treasures generally, I shall unburden my heart&#xD;
Sir, and not keep you much longer either."&#xD;
Mr. Fox had much respect for the whole family, that was evi-&#xD;
dent from the readiness, with which we complied with her wishes.&#xD;
"Well, little ones be off then for a spell; but be careful not to&#xD;
go beyond ealling distance nor to impose upon the g llantry of&#xD;
your, guides."&#xD;
The young people obeyed and Charles from- the start assumed&#xD;
the guide; not, that he had pressed his services in that capacity&#xD;
upon the girls-no, it seemed rather a matter understood, of&#xD;
Course, than anything else, he falling into it as naturally, as the&#xD;

"Well, young ladies" he'began with a smile and tone, that was&#xD;
condescending, without intending to be so "what do you like to&#xD;
see? Your fathers visit will be of short duration, as he says and&#xD;
I cannot show you half my treasures,-as mother is kind enough&#xD;
to style them-before he'll call you away. What would you see&#xD;
then? Shall I take you into the animal, mineral or vegetable&#xD;
kingdom? Will you have beasts, plants or stones? Speak Lucy."&#xD;
Lucy smiled and rather shyly answered:&#xD;
"It makes no difference to me Charles; suit your own pleasure."&#xD;
"But I would rather suit your pleasure. What does this young&#xD;
lady say? How did your father'call her?"&#xD;
"Dolores is my name."&#xD;
"Dolores? that means pain" the boy said gravely; it is a pretty&#xD;
but a sad name. Well Miss Dolores, what do you say?"&#xD;
"I say what Lucy said. I don't know your treasures, and one&#xD;
is therefore as welcome as another."&#xD;
Charles looked sharply at the little thing, that spoke so defin-&#xD;
itely.,&#xD;
"You are right" he said "and I shall yield the point. I'll show&#xD;
you things then, which I like best myself; if they don't suit your&#xD;
taste, you must blame yourselves."&#xD;
He led them to the rear part of the gardan,;where an enclosure&#xD;
contained several pet onimals of his. There was an eagle and&#xD;
lesser birds, a raccoon, a fox, a deer and other quadrupeds be-&#xD;
longed to the collection, which was a very choice one. The girls&#xD;
where delighted; for the animals were indeed fine specimens and&#xD;
very different from the lifeless crippled creatures, we generally&#xD;
see in museums or menageries. They were not very tame either,&#xD;
especially those, who from their nature were beasts of prey.&#xD;
Charles would therefore not allow Henry or the girls, to enter&#xD;
their enclosures; for they had on former occasions not only fright-&#xD;
ened but even attacked strangers. He himself however went in&#xD;
to every cage without hesitation and Dolores was at once delight-&#xD;
ed and frightened at the fearlessness with which he handled them.&#xD;
and the great attachment to their master and entire subjection&#xD;
to his will, these animals showed. She looked at him with con-&#xD;
siderable respect and listened to his explanations with profound&#xD;
attention. Much of what he said was new to her, but Dolores&#xD;
was not altogether so ignorant as her previous life would war-&#xD;

rant. Her parents had been educated people, and striven to the&#xD;
best of their ability, to impart their knowledge to their daughter..&#xD;
From them she had inherited a language above her recent station&#xD;
and many other things, which long neglect had made very dim,,&#xD;
but not obliterated altogether. As Charles spoke they rose to.&#xD;
view made his remarks doubly valuable and instructive.&#xD;
From the menagerie Charles took his visitors to other equally&#xD;
interesting departments of his little dominion, and wherever they&#xD;
went, he addressed his remarks unconsciously to Dolores. Per-&#xD;
haps her decisive language had impressed him, or he noticed in,&#xD;
her replies marks of a superior intellect, that enlisted his symn-&#xD;
pathy. Seeing that treats of an intellectual character pleas-&#xD;
ed her best, he made his selection accordingly, much to the dis-&#xD;
appointment of Lucy, who clamored for the white mice and pet.&#xD;
lambs and the large swing, in which Charles had often made her&#xD;
scream with fear and delight. But to-day, he seemed deaf to all&#xD;
her hints and allusions and seeing him so little inclined to humor&#xD;
her wishes, she gave Henry a hint and before Charles and Dolores&#xD;
knew it, they had strayed off to amusements more congenial to,&#xD;
their dispositions..&#xD;
And Charles and.his little mate, what did they in the mean time&#xD;
admire? The lad took her into his sanctum, which was study,,&#xD;
library, workshop and laboratory all in one. First he showed&#xD;
her the model of a frigate, a beautiful piece of workmanship, all&#xD;
his own making. He knew and told her the names of all the&#xD;
masts and sails and riggings and enlarged on the duties and&#xD;
beauties and hardships and perils of the seaman, until her fancy&#xD;
was completely captivated and she could scarcely tear herself&#xD;
away from the model. Next they went to a little engine,'which&#xD;
he had built, tho' the main parts had been cast for him at the&#xD;
factory. He had given the dimensions and calculated the power&#xD;
and at last had had the satisfaction of seeing the machine work&#xD;
perfectly. Now of course there was no steam up; but Charles of-&#xD;
ten fired his engine and then used its power in turning, boring or&#xD;
performingother mechanical labors he required.&#xD;
From the engine they came to cases with books ofvarious kinds,.&#xD;
whose very titles sounded too-learned for ignoratt little Dolores..&#xD;
She told him so with her wonted honesty and he said it was a&#xD;
pity and asked her, whether she had no desire to learn. Then it,&#xD;

was her turn to become animated and with a shining to tell him&#xD;
how anxious she was and that Mr, Fox had promised, to give her&#xD;
a chance, Her eagerness pleased the young student and their&#xD;
mutual exchanges and discoveries of similar likes and disliks&#xD;
made them fast friends and feel as if they had known each other&#xD;
ever so long. When Mr. Fox' voice finally summoned Dolores&#xD;
away, they were not half through with examining and talking&#xD;
and Charles exacted a -promise 'from her to come soon again,&#xD;
which Dolores was very willing to give. They .reached the older&#xD;
couple about the same time with Henry and Lucy; but the young&#xD;
people were too much occupied to notice the closing remarks of&#xD;
the hostess, who, judging from the earnest countenaie had been&#xD;
talking'rather serious matters."&#xD;
"And you will not take it ill, that I thus touched on matters,&#xD;
that are not my businessY'" she said.&#xD;
"How can you ask that question ?" he returned reproachfully.&#xD;
{I would be very ungrateful, not to appreciate your kind motives:&#xD;
though your friendship to me and mine makes you see things&#xD;
rather too gloomy, I think. If that man ever deceives me, I shall&#xD;
lose a faith in human nature and for that, if for no other reason&#xD;
simcerly he may not."&#xD;
"Well, it is in human nature, to err" the hostess resumed "and&#xD;
1 am the last, to claim infallibility. Having told you my suspi-&#xD;
cion, I feel relieved, and if after all this my warning is not heeded&#xD;
and you'l come to .harm, Sir, I shall at least have the conscious-&#xD;
ness, in having done my duty."&#xD;
"Certainly, certainly" Mr. Fox exclaimed and your words have&#xD;
proven anew, that you are, what I always thought you to be,-a&#xD;
true friend. Nor will they be thrown away, iMrs. Fuchs, indeed&#xD;
they will not and I promise you to keep my eyes open."&#xD;
"That is all I want,.and in regard to the boys, you will instruct&#xD;
IMr. Wood?"&#xD;
"Of course, I will, Mrs. Fuchs and that at once. Indeed I can-&#xD;
not imagine, what he meant by refusing your husband and I half&#xD;
believe, there must be a misunderstanding somewhere. At any&#xD;
rate, I shall soon know and misunderstanding or not, you may&#xD;
rest assured, that the boys will be admitted into the factory in&#xD;
.:ny way, that suits you'&#xD;

The hostess thanked him and then they shook hands and parted&#xD;
Fox and the girls resuming their walk to the -factory, which was&#xD;
now only a few hundred yards distant.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
THE SUPERITENDENT.&#xD;
The buildings were of considerable dimensions and well finished&#xD;
and the neatness and order prevailing everywhere bore evidence&#xD;
of an efficient management. The party entered the main building&#xD;
and going from place to place saw cutlery of all descriptions going&#xD;
through the various processes of manufactory. Lucy had seen&#xD;
this so often, that the charm of novelty was lacking ; but with&#xD;
Dolores it was very different. She was all attention, evidently&#xD;
taken in the most minute details and asking pertinent questions,&#xD;
wherever her little head could not furnish the explanation. Mr.&#xD;
Fox was much pleased at her zeal and furnished all the infor-&#xD;
ination, she could possible desire. From the main building they&#xD;
went into another of minor dimensions, in which the various sorts&#xD;
of knives and forks underwent the last finishing touch. The girls&#xD;
were delighted with the fine polish lying upon handle and blade&#xD;
and the eye of Dolores sparkled with delight, when Mr. Fox took&#xD;
a pocket knife of ingenious desire and more than ordinary beauty&#xD;
and made her a present of it.&#xD;
"I am to have this beautiful knife?" she cried in extasies. The&#xD;
Gift was so much in keeping with the energetic practical charac-&#xD;
ter of the child, that she enjoyed it very much and came near&#xD;
being thrown off that balance of mind, which she generally un-&#xD;
derstood how to preserve so , well. Her eyes beamed with a&#xD;
brightness more satisfactory to Mr. Fox than ever-so many words&#xD;
of thank would have been. He was glad to see, that she so soon&#xD;
regained rhe buoyancy of mind and body, which her excessive&#xD;
grief at her father's death had made him fear she would be want-&#xD;
ing for a long time. Her parent had only been buried a day and&#xD;
now this little girl assumed a' mien, of gayety, that might have&#xD;
led most observers to the belief, that she was a shallow, heartless&#xD;
&#xD;

creature, sacrificing the memory of the dead one to the charms&#xD;
and allurements of her new situation. Yet such observers would&#xD;
have been very much mistaken; deep natures like that of Dolores&#xD;
do not easily show their sorrow on the surface; like deep waters&#xD;
they preserve their tranquillity, unless agitated by storms of feai-&#xD;
ful magnitude in which'instance however they pitch their billows&#xD;
with a startling vehemence. Moreover Dolores had a will, a strong&#xD;
will and closing the rememberance of her father with filial piety&#xD;
into the recesses of her heart, she endeavored to spare her bene-&#xD;
factor the sight of sighs and tears, which would be foreign to him&#xD;
and, as she thought, unpleasant. Whether she preserved this stoic&#xD;
composure always when alone-whether she did not often wet&#xD;
her pillow with her tears in the still hours of night-who knows?&#xD;
Happy she, if she could control her grief; happy childhood, which&#xD;
rapidly forgets and already applies a healing balm, before the ar-&#xD;
row, that inflicted the wound, is well removed.&#xD;
"Good day, Mr. Fuchs" Fox addressed a man of his own age,&#xD;
who was busying himself about some machinery, that seemed&#xD;
out of order. "Always busy, as I see; if you'll stop long enough&#xD;
to listen, I shall deliver your wife's best wishes to you."&#xD;
This was said with a jocund air, as one man speaks to. another&#xD;
of equal standing; yet they slightly confused Mr. Fuchs. Mr.&#xD;
Fuchs was the true type of the german mechanic, as he emigrates&#xD;
into this country at mature age and with habits formed. There&#xD;
were the square strong features of the face, the eyes beaming with&#xD;
intelligence and good nature, the strong, sturdy frame bent some-&#xD;
what forward, either by hard work or that modest submissiveness;&#xD;
which formed an essential element of his earliest training. He&#xD;
shows a slight embarrassment when addressed by his betters and&#xD;
in spite of himself cannot unlearn that involuntary motion of his&#xD;
hand to his cap, when spoken to. Mr. Fox' kindness, instead of&#xD;
easing the man, oppressed him as it were, with a load of indebt-&#xD;
edness for so undeserved a condescension and in vain that gentle-&#xD;
man had through years of intercourse battled, to put Mr. Fuchs&#xD;
at his ease. That worthy man showed himself as nervous and&#xD;
fluttered to-day, as at the hour, when Mr. Fox first engaged his&#xD;
services for the factory-which by the by had been a considerable&#xD;
number of years ago-and finally Mr. Fox had got used to his&#xD;
ways and 16 longer minded them. .&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        47&#xD;
"Why Mr. Fox, that's you" the foreman said starting up in sur-&#xD;
prise, for he 'had been stooping down with his back towards&#xD;
the party. He smiled and bowed repeatedly, in the mean time&#xD;
holding his light working cap suspended above his head. "Quite&#xD;
a surprise indeed."&#xD;
"Why man I dont make myself as scarce as that; do I ?"&#xD;
"Well I think, I havn't seen Mr. Fox for a whole week, I am&#xD;
sure.&#xD;
"Indeed, is it that long, I have been absent? Well I guess I'll&#xD;
do better in future. Your wife, Mr. Fuchs, thinks so at any rate;&#xD;
I had a good long talk with the worthy lady."&#xD;
Mr. Fox spoke so meaningly and the look he cast into the&#xD;
other's eye, was so significant, that the foreman could not help no-&#xD;
ticing it. He grew more nervous. in consequence and said with&#xD;
considerable stammering.&#xD;
"Did she indeed ? Sure, Mr. Fox, I warned her, not to, I told&#xD;
her, I  . . .. I  . ..."&#xD;
"Never mind sir" Mr. Fox replied. "I took it, as it was in-&#xD;
tended and even if your lady were to apprehensive, it would cer-&#xD;
tainly do no harm. I shall keep my eyes open hereafter and&#xD;
visit the factory somewhat more frequently."&#xD;
Mr. Fox had lowered his voice in saying this, still his fear of&#xD;
being overheard was trifling, compared with that of Mr. Fuchs.&#xD;
That individual was the ambitudement of fear aod trembling and&#xD;
turning here and there, cast his eyes in every direction with a&#xD;
nervousness truly ludicrous. Still Mr. Fox did not laugh at him ;&#xD;
but in a soothing manner said to him:&#xD;
"Fear nothing, Sir, he is not present, nor shall he hear the least&#xD;
about your wife's eommunications; so rest easy on that score. In&#xD;
regard to your wishes about your boys I shall talk to Mr. Wood&#xD;
at once. I cannot imagine, what he meant by refusing you-"&#xD;
'Nor I Mr, Fox, unless he feared, that by the presence of the&#xD;
boys, my influence with you would be encreased. I know he dis-&#xD;
likes me, Mr. Fox."&#xD;
Mr. Fox shook his head.&#xD;
tI dont really know,. why he should ; he never intimated any-&#xD;
hing of the kind to me. At any rate, it will avail him nothing.&#xD;
Rest assured, my ood friend, that I value your services too high.-&#xD;
y    e ifluenced against you even by Mr. Wood."&#xD;

DOLORES.                         48&#xD;
With these words Mr. Fox went on with his conpaniolns and&#xD;
leaving the factory, approached and entered a one story building,&#xD;
above whose door the word: "Office" was painted in large striking&#xD;
letters. In the only room of the building two men were engaged&#xD;
in rather a lively altercation, so lively indeed that they did not hear&#xD;
the entrance of Mr. Fox, who in his turn stood still, rather sur.-&#xD;
Sprised at the tone of a dispute altogether too hot for the office of&#xD;
a large manufacturing establishment. Besides the disputants&#xD;
there was a young clerk in the office, who tho' following rhe argu-&#xD;
ments with much interest had retained sufficient control over his&#xD;
eyes and ears, to 'notice the entrance of his employer. He was&#xD;
evidently startled and by various signs and sounds endeavored to&#xD;
warn one of the disputants of possible troubles. The man thus&#xD;
warned appeared to fill a position of importance, in the factory;&#xD;
one could see this from the elegance of his clothes, the easy post-&#xD;
ure in an arm chair, which he occupied during the altercation,&#xD;
while his antagonist was standing with his hat in his hand; from&#xD;
assurance,-some might have termed it presumption-with which&#xD;
he eyed him: in short, from a certain something, that always be-&#xD;
speaks authority, though it is apt to change with the character ofl&#xD;
the occupant from the modest selfreliance of the gentleman to the&#xD;
swagger of the upstart. We dont want to be hard on appearanc-&#xD;
es, but we must confess, that we dont like that man's looks at all.&#xD;
His forehead is low and overhung by masses of coarse black hair,&#xD;
from under which his small eyes shine forth with a sparkle, that&#xD;
shares the charm of the rattlesnake, if that reptile really possess-&#xD;
es the power to hold gazer spell bound. His features were com-&#xD;
mon, with nothing to repel or to attract. The most singular&#xD;
qualityy of the man however was his voice, which preserved a son -&#xD;
orous sweetness even in the heat ofsdispute, what in this instance&#xD;
evidently had the effect, of irritating his adversary the more.&#xD;
We sons of Adam have the weakness, of becoming doubly nettled.&#xD;
when an insult is oflered us in a bland and polite manner.&#xD;
"Well Mr. Wood" the man addressed the person we have des-&#xD;
cribed "is that your last word? Is there no chance frr us, to earn&#xD;
a decent living in this factory? God knows, we haven't done too&#xD;
well before ; but if you insist upon taking ten more percent from&#xD;
our wages, we'll have to stint ourselves to dry bread."&#xD;
&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
49&#xD;
&#xD;
"Dry bread is very healthy food, my good man, and eaten by&#xD;
many a fellow, that knows as much and more than you."&#xD;
The man winced under the taunt.&#xD;
"May be they stand it, because it is'nt your bread."&#xD;
"Who compels you, my friend, to eat my bread?" the manager&#xD;
asked with the greatest suavity.&#xD;
"Necessity, Sir, and you know it and therefore venture to op-&#xD;
press a poor man. You know, I can't easily move with a 'large&#xD;
family; you know, this is my native place and also my comrades',&#xD;
and you think we'd rather suffer you to flay us, than quit and pull&#xD;
stakes. But, Mr. Wood let me tell you, there is an end to every&#xD;
thing and when a fellow is pushed against the wall, he can't back&#xD;
any further."&#xD;
Mr. Wood yawned:&#xD;
"My good man" he said "that will do. I understand you and&#xD;
you understand me: what then is the use of talking any further?&#xD;
I have my orders and they must be obeyed; so that ends the&#xD;
matter."z&#xD;
It may for you; but not for us. Indeed you always talk of&#xD;
orders; but somehow, I can't get it into my head, that Mr. Fox&#xD;
should want to be so hard on us. He used to be very good to us&#xD;
and fair too, and it's only since you are standing between us and&#xD;
him, that matters have changed for worse, .,You threaten to ,dis-&#xD;
charge any one, that complains to Mr. Fox; but if you discharge&#xD;
ne a dozen times over, I am going to have a talk to him.. May&#xD;
be I could tell him things...."&#xD;
Mr. Fox had only overheard the last remarks; but he had'&#xD;
heard enough, to deem his speedy intervention desirable.&#xD;
"Myy fsirpple.&#xD;
"My friends, what is all this about?" he said   forward&#xD;
and thereby causing both disputants to turn towards him with a&#xD;
start. Both were alarmed, though perhaps from different reasons;&#xD;
ut before either had time to respond, Mr. Fox continued:&#xD;
e whatc     I understood you right, you spoke of calling ont&#xD;
a I do for you, my friend?"&#xD;
"Well Mr. Fox," the man replied, letting the rim df- h  a g&#xD;
Through his fingers "the truth of the matter is, I wanted to ha&#xD;
a talk to you about your intention of reducing our wages. We&#xD;
earn little enough as it is, and..&#xD;

"Reduce your wages ?" Mr. Fox said in surprise "what do you&#xD;
mean? I never thought of such a thing. Who told you?"&#xD;
"Why Mr. Wood...."&#xD;
By this time that gentleman had regained his selfpossession.&#xD;
Wishing to check all further communications on the part of the&#xD;
laborer, he interrupted him, saying:&#xD;
"Mr. Fox, you surely recollect our 'conversation concerning&#xD;
this, You did not exactly authorize the measure, but I inferred&#xD;
from your remarks....."&#xD;
"Something, that was not in them" Mr. Fox said somewhat&#xD;
sharply. Then recollecting, that it would not answer to lecture&#xD;
his superintendent before one of the hands, he checked himself.&#xD;
Turning to the workman, he said:&#xD;
"Wilcox, this is a misunderstanding, which Mr. Wood. will be&#xD;
able to explain, no doubt. You may go for the present, to let&#xD;
your friends know, that we shall do nothing to you and them, but&#xD;
what is fair. I have some business with Mr- Wood just now; but&#xD;
if you'll do me the favor of calling at my house this evening or&#xD;
any time, that suits you, I shall be glad to see you."&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Fox, I shall be glad to call" the man replied&#xD;
and donning his hat, left the room a much happier fellow, than&#xD;
appearances had warranted a few minutes ago.&#xD;
Mr. Fox on the other hand, took a chair and his face bore a&#xD;
darker expression, than it was wont to show.&#xD;
"Little ones" he addressed the girls "business is too dry for&#xD;
your ears and you will undoubtedly prefer to run about, while I&#xD;
am deliberating with Mr. Wood. George, they haven't seen the&#xD;
machine room and the engine building. Supposing you lay down&#xD;
your pen for half an hour a d conduct them around. I charge&#xD;
you with their safety tho' and expect them back without broken&#xD;
bones. Be careful therefore and dont let them go too near the&#xD;
machinery."&#xD;
George was the young man at the desk. Doing his master's&#xD;
bidding, he arose and led the girls from the office. After the door&#xD;
was shut again, Mr. Fox turned to his companion and said:&#xD;
"Well, cousin Richard, what does all this signify?"&#xD;
It seemed, that it was Mr. Fox' destiny that day, to astonish&#xD;
everybody. He had startled his male and female servants, surprised&#xD;
his son and amazed his wife and now it was the turn of this gent.-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        51&#xD;
leman with the cunning eye and the sonorous voice, to experience&#xD;
the same thing. Mr. Fox was so very-different from what he used&#xD;
to be; he, spoke so much more sharply, shortly, to the point, that&#xD;
Mr. Wood for the first time since their long .connection felt em-&#xD;
barrassed altho' the confusion was but momentary ; using the&#xD;
sweetest undulations of his voice, he said:&#xD;
"It signifies, cousin Edward, that I go so far in my devotion to&#xD;
you, to save you all unnecessary trouble, even at the cost of my&#xD;
popularity."&#xD;
"Your popularity? I don't see how that can suffer, by making&#xD;
me the scapegoat fors our obnoxious measures."&#xD;
"Obnoxious they nay be-necessary they surely are."&#xD;
"Necessary? how necessary? I see no reason for this reduc-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"You will, if you examine the books. Cutlery has fallen in&#xD;
price and the raw material has risen. The expenses of your house-&#xD;
hold are considerable, you know, and if you want to'live as&#xD;
usual-."&#xD;
"I'll have to press the money out of the sweat of my poor lab-&#xD;
orers. No Sir, that is not my desire. I was'nt aware tho', that&#xD;
we lived so very extravagantly, Richard: how much money did&#xD;
you furnish last month?"&#xD;
"Three hundred Dollars for household expenses."&#xD;
"Well, that is enough, but hardly too much. I dont think, such&#xD;
sums will break us up for a while."&#xD;
"But Sir" the manager resumed reluctantly "you know there&#xD;
are other expenses."&#xD;
"Exactly, Richard, but they are small compared with the above&#xD;
expense"&#xD;
"There are, firstly, fifty dollars charged to your private account."&#xD;
"Well, what more?"&#xD;
"There are one thousand dollars charged to Mrs. Fox' private&#xD;
account."&#xD;
Mr. Fox straightened himself up in his chair.&#xD;
"Richard, you are joking: one thousand dollars monthly ex-&#xD;
pdenditure of my wife?"&#xD;
"Exactly, Sir, not a cent more nor less.&#xD;
"And the month before, how much?"&#xD;
"ne thousand dollars."&#xD;

52                    DOLORES.&#xD;
"And the month before that?"&#xD;
"One thousand dollars."&#xD;
Now it was Mr. Fox' turn to be astounded, yes thunderstruck-&#xD;
One thousand dollars a month for his wife's private necessities 1&#xD;
No wonder then, that a new reduction of the laborers' wages&#xD;
had become necessary. He felt his ire rising within him; but he&#xD;
was even more ashamed than angry; ashamed of his own neglb-&#xD;
gence, his culpable ease and indulgence, without which such things.&#xD;
could never have happened. But this should change now, he&#xD;
would rouse himself to redoubled energy and exercise a vigilance&#xD;
over his family, his servants and employees' which would make&#xD;
such outrages impossible hereafter.&#xD;
"Why did you never inform me of this, Richard?" he said ab-&#xD;
ruptly.S&#xD;
"Inform you Edward? Why of course, I expected you to know&#xD;
it. How could I think, that cousin Caroline would spend such&#xD;
sums of money without your knowledge? Indeed I am more as-&#xD;
tonished at my discovery, than you could possibly be at yours."&#xD;
Fox felt the point and calculated, that silence would be the best&#xD;
policy. So changing the topic, he begged Wood to show him the&#xD;
books and having received them, applied himself to their examin-&#xD;
ation with so much zeal, that when the girls returned after an&#xD;
hour's absence, he declared, that he had thought them gone but&#xD;
one fourth of that time. Still he would not let them wait any&#xD;
longer, especially since the accounts had evidently been kept with&#xD;
the most scrupulous care and had still further convinced him of&#xD;
the fact, that the blame rested chiefly with himself, at least as far&#xD;
as his wife's prodigality was concerned, and indeed even regard-&#xD;
ing Mr. Wood's intended measure. towards the hands. Mr. Fox&#xD;
saw well enough, that such extravagance could not well be indul-&#xD;
ged in without some penalty and if Mr. Wood preferred to let the&#xD;
poor laborers pay it and keep this unpleasant fact concealed from&#xD;
Mr. Fox-why, surely such conduct might show wrong principles&#xD;
and a false consideration, but still a consideration. Mr. Fox arose&#xD;
with a troubled mind; he had not yet exactly marked out his&#xD;
course of conduct, but he had at least resolved to commence the&#xD;
reform with his own person. Preparing to leave the office he said&#xD;
to Wood:&#xD;
"Cousin Richard. I have been a fool, that's evident; but I shall&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
take off that, cap now, rely on it. Let matters remain here, as&#xD;
they were before; but when Mrs. Fox comes for more money, tell&#xD;
her she cannot have a cent more than $100.00 a month. If she&#xD;
don't like it, refer her to me."&#xD;
He was on the point of leaving the office; but remembering&#xD;
something he had forgotten in his excitement, he once more&#xD;
turned to the manager.&#xD;
"Richard" he said, "Mr. Fuchs tells me, that you refused to&#xD;
-admit his boys into the factory. How is that ?"&#xD;
Mr. Wood's mien showed plainly, that this question touched&#xD;
another sore of his. Yet there was no way of avoiding the issue;&#xD;
-so he summoned courage and replied :&#xD;
"Well Edward, to tell the truth, I did refuse him. He asked&#xD;
special privileges, such as wanting his boys to work only p t&#xD;
of the time and having them turn to anything, they had a min&#xD;
to. Granting such favors would be a dangerous innovation and I&#xD;
doubted, whether I had authority, to do it. Therefore I refused."&#xD;
"Still you. thought you had the authority to reduce .the wages&#xD;
of all the hands and also forgot that it is as much, an act of&#xD;
.authority'to refuse is to grant. Conscience is a queer institution&#xD;
isn't it Richard? But to set yours at ease, I herewith give you&#xD;
full power to grant the wishes of Mr. Fuchs concerning his boys.&#xD;
Good day, Sir."&#xD;
With these words he departed, leaving Mr. Wood and his&#xD;
junior clerk in a rather perplexed state of mind. They gazed at&#xD;
one another with a sheepish expression and Wood at last began:&#xD;
-George, what in all creation does this mean? Do you under-&#xD;
stand, what has got into the head of the old dolt?"&#xD;
"Not exactly Mr. Wood; but what I see, means caution. It&#xD;
would be a nice thing, if Mr. Fox should remain wide awake and&#xD;
spoil our fine calculations."&#xD;
"The deuce take him! I'd sooner see him go to h-h, than give&#xD;
up my plans and my long cherished thirst for vengeance. But&#xD;
no, this energy of his will not last; it is too sudden to wear."&#xD;
"And if it lasts contrary to your expectations?"&#xD;
"Then we must change our tactics. The consummation of our&#xD;
present plan requires altogether too much time and the slightest&#xD;
suspicion would at once result in discovery, which would be worse&#xD;
than failure. No, I cannot bear the thought of disappointment&#xD;
&#xD;

54                     DOLORES.&#xD;
and if this sudden freak of his should last, we must take measures&#xD;
to quicken the denouement."&#xD;
"Perhaps Mrs. Fox can give you the clue to this change."&#xD;
"She may and I shall call on her, as soon as I can. This sud-&#xD;
den discovery of her imaginary extravagance is also a bad thing.&#xD;
It will stop one source, from which we swelled our income; but&#xD;
"it never rains, but it pours," as the proverb says.&#xD;
"That is so, and the admittance of the Fuchs boys comes also&#xD;
very importunely."&#xD;
"Well, yes, tho' after all I cannot see, how they will harm us&#xD;
m ch. I was wrong in making any ado about it. I fear the&#xD;
father more than the boys and a certain something tells me, that&#xD;
he suspects our operations."&#xD;
"That old poltroon? Why Richard, I should as soon suspect&#xD;
my boot-jack. No, I have no fear of him, but a good deal of his&#xD;
son. There isn't a smarter and more cunning youngster to be&#xD;
found for five miles around."&#xD;
"YQu may be right George and it will do no harm, to watch&#xD;
his movements. , It's surely very vexing though, to be bothered&#xD;
at a dozen places at once. Sometimes I think, if I had known,&#xD;
how much trouble would be in store for us, I wouldn't have&#xD;
embarked on so perilous an undertaking."&#xD;
"Why Richard! I am astonished. You and Fox seem to have&#xD;
swapped characters."&#xD;
"It isn't that George; but I begin to understand what it means,&#xD;
when the bible says: the way of the transgressor is hard."&#xD;
George laughed lustily.&#xD;
"Mr. Wood in the role of the parson !" he cried. "That is too&#xD;
good and if somebody told me now, the world would come to an&#xD;
end to-morrow, I should believe it. Indeed I must take some-&#xD;
medicine to guard against infection; for this madness seems to&#xD;
be in the air and before I am aware of it, I shall have caught it&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
His companion did not heed his mockeries, but brooding over&#xD;
the dark thoughts, that filled his mind, preserved his silence.&#xD;
George in order to rouse him, shook him by the shoulder.&#xD;
"Man, wake up !" lie cried. "If the prospect of wealth and&#xD;
vengeance cannot stir you up, let the sweet thought of love&#xD;
requited warm your sluggish blood."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        55&#xD;
Wood -started.&#xD;
"What do you mean? What do you know of love? Listen to&#xD;
the boy! Hardly fledged lie talks about the passion of a man !"&#xD;
"You forget the school I am in, Richard" George said with a&#xD;
sneer. "Under your tuition one ripens fast. But to come back&#xD;
to the point; it is hardly fair, that you should -try to hide this&#xD;
courtship of yours from pour faithful ally. It is no use, at all&#xD;
events, for I know as well as you, that you mean to steal not only&#xD;
your employer's money, but his wife in the bargain. Do tell&#xD;
me, how far you have succeeded !"&#xD;
Wood cast a look upon the other, that made him stop at once.&#xD;
"George" lie said, "if I were you, I would not meddle with mat-&#xD;
ters, that don't concern me. We are allies in our attempt upon&#xD;
the purse of Mr. Fox; but not in any upon his wife. If, what&#xD;
you hinted at, were true, it would surely be none of your business,&#xD;
and I'll tell you once for all, that I shall brook no attempt of&#xD;
yours, to extend our partnership in that direction."&#xD;
"Jealous !" the young man muttered to himself, as he resumed&#xD;
his seat, to close an account. "I'll follow your advise and hold my&#xD;
peace; but at the same time it will not be amiss, to keep a look-&#xD;
out on your movements. A man, who sells his employer; will not&#xD;
he slow to sell his friend and it may be well enough to set a trap&#xD;
or you, that can be sprung, when necessity requires it."&#xD;
The worthy youngster chuckled at his smartness, but in moral-&#xD;
izing on his friend's treachery, he forgot the trifling circumstance,&#xD;
that he came under the same category.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
1)EVELOPMENTs.&#xD;
Dolores had conquered the basement ; but, -if from this success&#xD;
she formed the hope of conquering also the buodoir, she was great-&#xD;
ly mistaken. The servants at least had hearts; but if Mrs. Fox&#xD;
at all possessed that organ, generally considered the seat of feel-&#xD;
ing, she did not show it in her conduct. Perhaps her heart had&#xD;
uindergone a slow process of petrifaction, or it was, may be, so&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7070-00000029"/>&#xD;
56                       DOLORES.&#xD;
filled with her own important self, that there was no room for&#xD;
other parties in it. She certainly had none for poor Dolores and&#xD;
from the way, she treated her husband, for him either. Richard&#xD;
alone could boast of receiving from his mother tokens of affection,&#xD;
but even these were of a very capricious character and more cal-&#xD;
culated to injure than to benefit the boy. There was no notion&#xD;
of his, however odd, which his mother did not gratify, and though&#xD;
Mr. Fox was far from approving such a course, he kept his coun-&#xD;
sel for the sake of peace. That exhibition of energy, which had&#xD;
astonished the whole household, was too antagonistic to his char-&#xD;
acter, to last any length of time. It had indeed come to a speedy&#xD;
terminus and Mr. Fox had resumed his old habit of rather yielding&#xD;
and avoiding, than by decision ruling. Only in regard to Dolores&#xD;
lie was determined to make an exception; but as the prudent little&#xD;
creature had quickly read his disposition, she took good care, to&#xD;
give him no occasion for the scenes of strife and dispute, he shun-&#xD;
ned so much. She had resolved rather to suffer herself than to&#xD;
make him suffer and many were the taunts and jeers and insults,&#xD;
she received from Mrs. Fox and her son, which she bore in pa-&#xD;
tience,, without even in the slightest intimating their existence&#xD;
to her friend and protector. This was meant kindly, but for Mr.&#xD;
Fox' reformation it certainly was unfortunate. Practice makes&#xD;
perfect, says the adage and the practice wanting, Mr. Fox remain-&#xD;
ed a bungler in the art of ruling.&#xD;
We have neither the time nor the disposition to dwell on the&#xD;
method of torture, which the enemies of Dolores applied in her&#xD;
case; nor to describe the thousand little tricks, by which they&#xD;
endeavored to make her uncomfortable; the words containing&#xD;
poison, the eyes looking daggers, the miens conveying jeers.&#xD;
There is little pleasure in painting in detail human wickedness;&#xD;
but it is perfectly intolerable, if it bears upon the innocence of&#xD;
childhood. Fortunately Dolores had been provided by nature&#xD;
with various weapons of defense. The attempts of Mrs. Fox she&#xD;
always met with that sweet forbearance, which in itself is more&#xD;
calculated to lame the arm of the assailant; than resistance though&#xD;
as yet her conduct had not lessened the disposition of that woman,&#xD;
to abuse her, it had at least on various occasions driven the&#xD;
blush of shame and confusion into her cheeks. Master Robert,&#xD;
however, Dolores met with other weapons. The threat of Mr. Fox&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                         57&#xD;
had effectually stopped that young man's attempts, to inflict cor-&#xD;
poral punishment on the little girl. The only way, in which he&#xD;
now could annoy her, was to abuse her in words and this was a&#xD;
mode of warfare, in which she was more than a match fdr him.&#xD;
Returning irony for scorn,-tho' never leaving the precints of de-&#xD;
corum, which her adversary totally disregarded-she would soon&#xD;
turn the point and from the position of the one assailed change&#xD;
to that of the assailer. Punishing him severely by the keenness&#xD;
of her wit, she would drive him from corner to corner, until at&#xD;
last he had to beat an unglorious retreat, hating her worse than&#xD;
ever, but gradually becoming a little shy, to challenge her to en-&#xD;
gagements, which invariably terminated in his defeat.&#xD;
As we have intimated, she kept her annoyance carefully con-&#xD;
cealed from Mr. Fox; but the constant stress upon her mind&#xD;
could not be endured without injurious results for her ,health.&#xD;
She grew nervous and the angular forms of her body became still&#xD;
more angular. She lost both color and appetite and even Mr. Fox,&#xD;
indifferent observer as he was, could not help noticing the change.&#xD;
His attention once attracted and his-apprehension roused, he be-&#xD;
gan to show again a spirit resembling that, with which he had&#xD;
adopted and installed his little foster-daughter. Taking her hand&#xD;
and leading her to the very arbor, that had witnesssd their ori-&#xD;
ginal compact, he made her sit down and looking into her eve&#xD;
with anxious tenderness, said&#xD;
"Dolores do you recollect, what you promised ne once, at this&#xD;
very place?"&#xD;
"I do, clear father" she said with her usual sweet expression. "I&#xD;
felt too happy at this place, to ever forget, what was said between&#xD;
us here."&#xD;
"You recollect, that you promised, always to love me like a&#xD;
daughter?"&#xD;
"And have'nt I loved you so?" the little maiden cried, throwing&#xD;
her arms around his neck and smiling archly. "Indeed if I tried&#xD;
ever so hard, I dont think I could love you any better, than I do&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"I believe you, darling" lie said, returning her caresses "but&#xD;
Dolores, love begets confidence, and have you confided to me, as&#xD;
you ought to have? Look in my eyes child, and answer that ques-&#xD;
tion ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7070-00000030"/>&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
But Dolores hung her head, the victim of a lively embarrass-&#xD;
ment, that dyed her cheeks with scarlet and even drove the tears&#xD;
into her eyes.&#xD;
"You do not answer, Dolores and by your silence confess your&#xD;
guilt. Instead of confiding in me, and telling me, that they are&#xD;
teazing you and worrying you to death, you bear your injury in&#xD;
silence and let the paleness of your cheeks betray the secret, which&#xD;
your lips ought to have imparted- Say, was that right; was it&#xD;
well done?"&#xD;
Instead of answering, the little one hung her head still deeper&#xD;
and the tears came trickling more copiously from out her eyes.&#xD;
"I know your motives, Dolores," he resumed, "and they would&#xD;
still more endear you to my heart, if that were possible ; but if&#xD;
I love ease and tranquillity, I value your welfare and happiness&#xD;
infinitely more highly and would with cheerfulness sacrifize the&#xD;
former, in order to secure the latter. This cannot be tolerated&#xD;
any longer ; but what must be done? Tell me, shall I put you in&#xD;
some institute or other, to pursue a course of study?"&#xD;
D6lores no longer hung her head. Raising it quickly and&#xD;
energetically, she answered :&#xD;
"No, no, father, I will not leave you. If they vex me by their&#xD;
enmity, you make me much more happy by your effection."&#xD;
"Heaven knows, I would not like to part with you. What I&#xD;
proposed was for your good. But if you will not leave me, there&#xD;
 must t least be some alteration. If this were to go on much&#xD;
longer rou would waste to a shadow and (lie with consumption&#xD;
like yor poor father."&#xD;
The girl thought a moment; then she said&#xD;
"You spoke of studying. I think, if I could be allowed, to'&#xD;
learn;I should be happy."&#xD;
"Allowed? Of course, my good child, you will be allowed; but&#xD;
where will you study and what?"&#xD;
"Where?" Dolores said wistfully, "I think I know. There is&#xD;
Mr. Goodman, to whom Charley Fuchs says his lessons."&#xD;
"Why sure enough" cried Mr. Fox, "I never thought of him.&#xD;
He is a worthy man and, as they say, a good teacher. At least he&#xD;
had made quite a scholar out of Charley. Run Dol and get your&#xD;
hat and mine, we shall see at once, whether Mr. Goodman will&#xD;
consent, to bother himself with my lit tle beauty."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        59&#xD;
Dolores fairly skimmed the sward as she ran to do his bidding.&#xD;
When she returned a minute afterwards, she did- no longer look&#xD;
the pining melancholy child of the morning. The old lustre had&#xD;
returned to her eyes, the smile to her corners of the mouth and&#xD;
the glow of health to her cheeks. Mr. Fox was delighted at this&#xD;
change, thinking, that he had now found the panacea for his&#xD;
favorite. Leaving the park, the pair took the street in a direction&#xD;
opposite to the side, where the factory lay. Walking through the&#xD;
greater part of the village, which formed one long line along the&#xD;
turnpike, they finally reached a building almost concealed by the&#xD;
clusters of bushes surrounding it. It was much less presumpt-&#xD;
uous than the mansion, but yet superior to most of the cottages&#xD;
of the village, excepting perhaps the house of Mr. Fuchs. It stood&#xD;
in close proximity, to a venerable stone church, from the numerous&#xD;
cracks of which ivy and other creepers were hanging in beautiful&#xD;
profusion and around whose weather-beaten steeple multitudes.&#xD;
of crows were making short trips filling the air with their&#xD;
(lismnal cries. The house was the parsonage and Mr. Goodman,&#xD;
the gentleman they were in search of, the worthy pastor of the&#xD;
village. He was a widower, having lost his wife a number of&#xD;
years ago and now living in company with  spinster sister, who,&#xD;
unlike most old maids, had guarded her heart from shrinking like&#xD;
her features. She kept house for her brother, and was the oracle&#xD;
of the village in everything beyond the margin of every-day's&#xD;
life and Mr. Fox insisted, that in consequence of her conciliatory&#xD;
counsels the justice of the peace in the village came near starving,&#xD;
She was now standing in the garden, examining the blue clusters&#xD;
of grapes, which were approaching ripeness and blinked with&#xD;
tempting richness at the passers-by. Discerning the visitors, as&#xD;
they entered the gate, she went to meet them with her hands ex-&#xD;
tended and a genuine hospitable smile on her wrinkled face.&#xD;
"Aye, aye ! Mr. Fox and my little Dolores !" she cried, "rare,&#xD;
but welcome guests. [thought you had forgotten us altogether."&#xD;
"Why, Miss Sarah, you know the passion of us foxes for&#xD;
grapes" Mr. Fox said with a cnnning twinkle in his eye and&#xD;
laughing at his own joke, "I see yours are getting ripe, madam."&#xD;
Aint, is that the reason of your call?" the damsel said, entering&#xD;
into the spirit of his remark, "then you really deserve to fare like&#xD;
your namesake, that didn't get any."&#xD;
&#xD;

DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
"If I dont, I'll imitate the fellow still further abusing your&#xD;
grapes all over the village and telling everybody, that they are&#xD;
sour."&#xD;
"That would be dreadful Mr. Fox and more than I could stand.&#xD;
I suppose I'll have to compromise the matter and give you your&#xD;
.share, even if you dont deserve it."&#xD;
"Well now, that sounds more reasonable, doesn't it-Doll?&#xD;
Won't we two pitch in?"&#xD;
"You won't to-day, my dear sir, because they aint ripe; but&#xD;
come into the house. I'll call brother Andrew, he'll be glad to&#xD;
see you, in spite of your dreadful intentions against his grapes."&#xD;
Miss Goodman led the way and entering the house showed the&#xD;
guests into one of those old fashioned parlors, where comfort&#xD;
was the great consideration and boastful elegance a total stranger.&#xD;
One could sit on the chairs without fear of their frail legs and&#xD;
step on the carpet with out risking the displeasure of the lady of&#xD;
the house, for soiling a handsome flower in the pattern. Excus-&#xD;
ing herself, Miss Sarah left the room, but shortly afterwards re-&#xD;
turned with her brother, who shook hands with his guests, show-&#xD;
ing the genuine cordiality and guileless simplicity, which Oliver.&#xD;
Goldsmith so beautifully depicts in the parson's colleague, the&#xD;
vicar of Wakefield. If the reader will kindly allow me to sub-&#xD;
stitute that famous portrait of a worthy minister for my own,he&#xD;
has the character of Andrew Goodman to the letter. No worthier&#xD;
man ever filled the pulpit than he, and in all his bearings, be it&#xD;
as the preacher of the gospel, the teacher of his flock, the visitor&#xD;
of the sick or the genial companion at the fireside-he showed an&#xD;
amiability, which was perfectly captivating and caused the whole&#xD;
village to look upon him with pride, love and respect.&#xD;
"Ah! my dear Mr. Fox" he said with a touch of sarcasm, "how&#xD;
fortunate for me, to be the proprietor of those handsome grapes.&#xD;
They secure me at least one visit a year from your worthy self."&#xD;
"Don't scold, Mr. Goodman" Fox replied. "You somehow&#xD;
-Are less apt at it, than anything else."&#xD;
"There you are right Mr. Fox" Miss Sarah interrupted, "but&#xD;
it's no wonder, for he attempts it so very rarely."&#xD;
"Practice makes perfect, Miss Sarah. However Mr. Goodman&#xD;
is perfect in so many other things, that-he can well afford, to do&#xD;
without the perfection at scolding."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                         61&#xD;
"You'll spoil him by your flattery."&#xD;
"I'll run the risk, madam. But Mr. Goodman, you were right&#xD;
in blaming me for having selfish motives in my present visit.&#xD;
Isn't the grapes tho', that brought me this time, 't is something&#xD;
worse."&#xD;
"Let us have it.. After your warning, I am prepared to receive&#xD;
the shock without detriment to my nerves."&#xD;
"Well, sir, I have the intention of trespassing on your valuable&#xD;
time. This little girl of mine has conceived the idea, that she&#xD;
must needs drink at the fountain of knowledge and that nobody&#xD;
)ut Mr. Goodman is fit to administer the draught. What do you&#xD;
say now sir?"&#xD;
"1 say, that the idea of stilling the thirst of a good little girl&#xD;
like Dolores is much more comfortable, than that of having a fox&#xD;
after one's grapes"&#xD;
"Thank you Sir. Am I to understand from your reply, that&#xD;
you would really charge yourself with the 'instruction of my&#xD;
daughter?"&#xD;
"That is my intention, Sir, and I can assure you, that, instead&#xD;
of being a trouble; it will be nothing but a pleasure. I have been&#xD;
watching the little Miss and from my observations and the praise&#xD;
of my pupil, Charley Fuchs, I have an idea, that Dolores will make&#xD;
a good scholar."&#xD;
"I am glad, to hear you say so. Pll leave the matter entirely&#xD;
to your excellent judgment. When do you want Dolores to com-&#xD;
mence?"&#xD;
"The sooner the better. The fall is drawing near and if you.&#xD;
want the little one to accomplish much, before your removal to&#xD;
town, she cannot begin too soon."&#xD;
Mr. Fox' face got very sober.&#xD;
"It is a fact ;" he said "four more weeks and our country life&#xD;
will be at an end. I hate town, I do, heartily and if it wasn't for&#xD;
Mrs. Fox, I should stay here all the year round."&#xD;
,,Well, Mr. Fox I share your views ;" Miss Sarah remarked "if&#xD;
I were to stay in town a single winter, I think I'd die with suffo-&#xD;
cation. I pitty the little ones on account of their confinement.&#xD;
"Oh! Lucy and Dick are used to it; they even share their moth-&#xD;
er's liking for town."&#xD;
"But this little one: wont she feel like a bird in a cage?"&#xD;

''I fear she will and that too like one picked at by mischivious&#xD;
atbirds." Mr. Fox said with a sigh.&#xD;
"Why, I do not understand you, Mr. Fox" the parson remarked&#xD;
with some wonderment in his voice. What does your smile sig-&#xD;
nify ?"&#xD;
Mr. Fox shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
"Mr. Goodman, I wouldn't tell everybody; but with you I'm&#xD;
safe enough.- Did you never notice, that there is some opposi-&#xD;
tion in the mansion to this little one?"&#xD;
The parson nodded.&#xD;
"I sometimes thought so much; but from charity discredited&#xD;
my supposition. If Dolores is disliked by your family, her resi-&#xD;
dence in town will surely be unpleasant."&#xD;
"Unpleasant is hardly strong enough a term. Still, what am I&#xD;
to do? I cannot leave the girl alone in the big empty house, with&#xD;
the servants ?"&#xD;
"Hardly" Miss Sarah replied "but if I knew, that brother&#xD;
Andrew would concur, I think I could find an expedient."&#xD;
Mr. Goodman smiled.&#xD;
"j think, I do anticipate your proposition.  At all events&#xD;
you canl make none,, that would not meet with my hearty appro-&#xD;
bation.'&#xD;
"Thank you, Andrew. I thought if you would agree and Mr.&#xD;
Fox be willing, to part with his charge during the wintermonths,&#xD;
it would give us much pleasure, to receive the little girl into our&#xD;
household during that time."&#xD;
Mr. Goodman nodded with a mien that seemed to say:&#xD;
"Exactly! that's what I expected and-.suits me to perfection.&#xD;
Such a.dear little creature will lighten up our somber house."&#xD;
Dolores looked "shy. She moved nearer to Mr. Fox and took&#xD;
his hand.&#xD;
"They may be very good people" her motion said, "but they&#xD;
ain't my dear foster-father after all."&#xD;
Mr. Fox was much affected by this unexpected kindness. It&#xD;
really relieved him of a load of doubt and anxiety, which the very&#xD;
thought of removing Dolores to the narrow sphere of his winter-&#xD;
residence, where she would be much more exposed to the malice&#xD;
of her adversaries, had created. Rising and taking the lady's hand,&#xD;
he said:&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES                          63&#xD;
-Miss Sarah, that is just like you; but much more than I had a&#xD;
right to expect. From the bottom of my heart I thank you for your&#xD;
offer, and accept it on condition, that you will allow a compensa.&#xD;
tion for the outlay occasioned by Dolores, presence."&#xD;
"Never mind the compensation" Mr. Goodman said "which is a&#xD;
secondary matter. We forget that Dolores is also a party to the&#xD;
agreement. Her countenance does not look, as if she liked it&#xD;
very much."&#xD;
The face of the girl was indeed much clouded up, and tears&#xD;
were shining in. the corners of her eyes; but Mr. Goodman's&#xD;
words had a wonderful effect upon her. Checking her feelings&#xD;
with that strong will, we have noticed in the girl before, she tried&#xD;
to smile and with considerable firmness said:&#xD;
"Of course, I wouldn't like to leave my dear good father, and&#xD;
I was sorry for a little while, when you talked about it; very sorry&#xD;
indeed. But I know also, that he wouldn't want to leave me here&#xD;
if it wasn't for my good. So I won't be sorry any  more, at least,&#xD;
I'll try not to."&#xD;
Mr. Fox looked at the others with an inquiring glance.&#xD;
"Just as I thought" he said "just as I expected my little&#xD;
daughter to speak. Mr. Goodman, I never saw the like of it; al-&#xD;
ways right, always sensible; she has a wonderful perception of&#xD;
propriety. Nor can she be spoiled either, or I wouldn't praise&#xD;
her in her face. I praise the day, that bestowed this gift upon&#xD;
me."&#xD;
Dolores hung her head. It was evident that she was less fond&#xD;
of praise than of doing right. Mr. Goodman looked at her ap-&#xD;
provingly and Sarah stroked her hair, which, however, would not&#xD;
be straightened out, but with a rebellious obstinacy always spring&#xD;
hack into its original curly condition.&#xD;
"She is a good girl" the damsel said, "and it shall be my&#xD;
endeavors to make her miss her good papa as little as possible.&#xD;
Our house is.a little quiet and old fashioned, but I think Dolores&#xD;
will like it well enough."&#xD;
"At any rate she has a respite of four weeks and in that time&#xD;
will get to know us a little better" Mr. Goodman suggested. "I&#xD;

lady to her fate."&#xD;
"Reconcile?" Mr. Fox replied. "1 think she will be reconciled.&#xD;

I have half a notion to make you certify in writing that I merely&#xD;
lend you the child; for when I return in the spring, she'll be so&#xD;
fond of you and the parsonage, that I'll have difficulty in coaxing&#xD;
her back to the mansion."&#xD;
This was said jestingly and with the purpose of giving the con~&#xD;
versation a cheerful turn; but Dolores took it in earnest and&#xD;
would have protested, if the others had let her. As it was, Sarah&#xD;
proposed a ramble over the house and the ground, to which the&#xD;
child assented. By the hand of her new friend and prospective&#xD;
foster-mother, she started on her tour, which gave her much pleas~&#xD;
ure and soon put her on familiar terms with the spinster. They&#xD;
saw the house and the yard and the outbuildings with the fowls and&#xD;
cows and other stock; they walked through the flower and vege-&#xD;
table gardens, which distinguished themselves by taste and neat-&#xD;
ness, spurning the very thought of weeds. Dolores had seen&#xD;
gardening on a larger scale at the mansion, but what those of the&#xD;
parsonage lacked in size, they made up in taste and neatness, so&#xD;
that Sarah's fear of a disparaging comparison was entirely un-&#xD;
founded. ' Dolores was pleased and her honest countenance'&#xD;
showed as plainly as could be, that her tongue did not dissemble.&#xD;
Encouraged by the little girl's tokens of enjoyment, Miss Sarah-&#xD;
extended their ramble to the adjacent church, showing her first,&#xD;
the grounds, which were no longer used for burying purposes and&#xD;
then the edifice itself. Climbing the winding stairs, that led into-&#xD;
the steeple, they stepped upon a gallery, from which a charming&#xD;
view-the most charming one of all her experience, Dolores de-&#xD;
clared-met their eye, showing not only the beautiful valley, in&#xD;
whose midst the church was lying, but also the blue expanse of-&#xD;
the ocean to the far and almost invisible, line, where sky and&#xD;
water kissed each other. From the gallery they could look over&#xD;
the intervening clusters of trees and see the craggy shore of the&#xD;
little bay, which from the. ocean penetrated into the coast and;&#xD;
where the restless, neverweary waves had eat out the softer parts.&#xD;
of the rocks, leaving the harder ribs standing in the most phan-&#xD;
tastic forms and shapes. To-day, with such mild and pleasant,&#xD;
weather, it required some stretch of imagination to realize that&#xD;
these gentle rippling waves should have been able to reach the-&#xD;
the top of those towering crags and, more than that, eaten out a&#xD;
considerable portion of their substance; but Miss Sarah warned&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        65&#xD;
Dolores not to form an idea of the sea by a summer's sojourn on&#xD;
the coast, It would be en erroneous one, she said and the blasts&#xD;
of winter would soon rectify the wrong impression. But who&#xD;
could think of storms and desolation, when all nature breathed&#xD;
joy and tranquility? Dolores could not tire of looking at the lit-&#xD;
tle bay, forming a rather precarious harbor and containing that&#xD;
,afternoon a dozen fishing vessels and quite a number of smaller&#xD;
,crafts of various descriptions from the boat with mast and sail&#xD;
down to the nutshell of a skiff, propelled mereiy by means of oars.&#xD;
The gils eyes would not withdraw from the pretty picture, but&#xD;
pointing out to her companion one beauty after another, she got&#xD;
quite excited. This excitement however got to its climax, when&#xD;
all at once she saw a sailing boat draw its graceful furrows&#xD;
through the water, which she recognized as that of Charles and&#xD;
Henry Fuchs. Two young men were in the craft and although&#xD;
the distance was too great, to recognize the features, the size and&#xD;
the suits of the boys left Dolores no doubt, that the brother's&#xD;
were in the vessel.&#xD;
"It is Charles !" she cried, making no mention at all of the&#xD;
.second figure and thereby unconsciously showing her predilec-&#xD;
tion "it is Charles sailing in his craft. He showed it  me the&#xD;
other day and promised to take me out and he must do it.too, for&#xD;
.oh see Miss Sarah, isn't it beautiful?"&#xD;
Miss Sarah agreed and indulged her young friend as long as&#xD;
possible. When she thought it time to return to the house, she&#xD;
only needed to say, that Mr. Fox would be waiting; for no soon-&#xD;
er had the words left her lips, when the little girl hastennd down&#xD;
stairs, taking two steps at the time, making it a hard task for&#xD;
Miss Sarah. to keep up. This also the considerate little creature&#xD;
did see and stopping to await the damsel's arrival, apologized for&#xD;
her want of consideration. Miss Sarah was much pleased; she&#xD;
congratulated herself upon her splendid idea of receiving this&#xD;
little girl with the bright understanding and the sensitive perg.&#xD;
ception into her household. It is a pleasure, to manage clever,&#xD;
docile children and Sarah, in guiding this gifted girl, anticipated&#xD;
the same pleasure though in a higher sense, which the horseman&#xD;
experiences in a steed of delicate mouth, which feels and obeys&#xD;
the slightest pull of the rein, or the sailor in the craft, that spins&#xD;
like a top on her heels, minds the helm in fair weather and foul&#xD;

fish.&#xD;
When the two reached the parlor, they found it empty; the&#xD;
parson and his guest had long ago settled the question regard-&#xD;
ing Dolores' instruction and in imitation of the ladies, left the&#xD;
house in search of nature and her beauties. Sarah and her charge&#xD;
found them walking the very covered archway, whose fruit had&#xD;
furnished the topic of the innocent badinage, we have recorded&#xD;
on a previous occasion. They heard Mr. Fox say :&#xD;
"You may draw on me for $100.00, Sir, in support of your be-&#xD;
nevolent efforts. In fact you will always find me ready to aid'&#xD;
you in any project of charity according to my means. A man&#xD;
that has a little money, ought surely not to hesitate to give in a&#xD;
cause where his betters spend time and comfort and health. No&#xD;
thanks, Sir, I should feel ashamed to receive it. But ah, there are&#xD;
the ladies. Dolores, Mr. Goodman has kindly consented to take&#xD;
you in charge as early as to-morrow. He will furnish you with&#xD;
such books, as you may need. And now good bye, my friends.&#xD;
Am I not to be envied? I need neither say: fare gently with my&#xD;
child, nor on the other hand: honor the mouth of thy teacher,,&#xD;
for wisdom floweth therefrom. Both these wishes are a fixed&#xD;
fact, a matter of course. Good bye, good bye."&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
THE TEMPTER.&#xD;
That same afternoon anther scene was being enacted at the&#xD;
mansion, which is my duty to describe, tho' I do not take much&#xD;
pleasure in making the attempt. The public are as much blase&#xD;
in their reading matter as in most other things and to satisfy&#xD;
them, villains of the deepest dye, their doings and their victims&#xD;
must be depicted. Nothing less, than foul murders, villainous&#xD;
plots, hairbreadth's escapes andseductions or abductions will&#xD;
answer, and the fair readers seem to forget altogether, that, to.&#xD;
make us write all these things,-however true and natural,-they&#xD;
-condemn us to a close companionship with people, who are any-&#xD;

others and presented as a warning example to the&#xD;

likely to effect a change in the public taste ason, I may as&#xD;
well go to work, and bring before my reader's eye oon,  who&#xD;
the world esteemed a fair cop of agentean; but  whom&#xD;

"Susan where is Mr. Fox?"&#xD;
"Gone out, Mr. Wood, with Miss Dolores."&#xD;
"Miss indeed! and Mrs. Fox?"&#xD;
"Is dressing for a ride.. I heard her bid Richard, to have the&#xD;
brown mare hitched to the new buggy"&#xD;
"Very well Susan; when she comes down stairs, tell her, I am&#xD;
in the parlor."&#xD;
Mr. Wood deposited his hat ont     aw             o&#xD;
room, where about ten minutes afterwards, he wasjoined by the&#xD;
mistress of the house."jon                           yth&#xD;
"Ah! cousin Richard" she said with a smile, offering him her&#xD;
gloved hand "a rare guest indeed. I havn't seen you for a century&#xD;
and am therefore doubly sorry, not to be able to enjoy your visit.&#xD;
In going t    iv to town, to do a little shopping. Will you&#xD;
kindly excuse me?"&#xD;
"Who is to take you, Caroline?"&#xD;
"Why, Dick; I hear him driving the buggy before the house,&#xD;
even now,"&#xD;
"Lethus go out then; I dont want to keep you waiting."&#xD;
As the two stepped on the portico, they saw Richard Jr. sitting&#xD;
in the gy,ip in hand, his face radiant with the expecta-&#xD;
tion of the drive.&#xD;
"Dick&#xD;
"Dicky, my boy" Mr. Wood addressed him "I have a favor, to&#xD;
ask."&#xD;
"What is it uncle?"&#xD;
Want you, to give me your seat in the buggy."&#xD;

The boy's miens grew sullen.&#xD;
"I won't do it, Sir," he said shortly.&#xD;
Mrs. Fox looked inquiringly at Mr. Wood.&#xD;
"I think, you will Dick" that gentleman said, "as 5oon as you&#xD;
have heard the rest of my proposition. If you will give me your&#xD;
seat in the buggy, I shall give you a note to George, to the effect,&#xD;
that he may saddle my pony for you and give you my new gun,&#xD;
so that you may have a ride and a hunt at the same time."&#xD;
Mr. Wood knew, that theboy fancied his pony more than all&#xD;
the horses in his own stable; but to make the offer irresistable&#xD;
he added the offer of the new gun, which Richard had thus far&#xD;
'never been allowed to touch. The effect was as marked as sud-&#xD;
den. Jumping from his seat, the boy cried eagerly :&#xD;
"Agreed Sir, hurry up and write me the note."&#xD;
Wood did his bidding; tearing a leaf from his diary, he pen-&#xD;
cilled a few hasty lines. Handing the paper to the boy, he signi-&#xD;
fled to Mrs. Fox his readiness to assume his duties as cavalier&#xD;
attendant. The lady said nothing; but taking her seat in the&#xD;
carriage and allowing him the place at her side, suffered him to&#xD;
drive from the park into the road, without asking an explanation&#xD;
of his conduct. Still when they had passed the factory and Wood&#xD;
seemed exclusively engaged with the management of the horse,&#xD;
she remarked:&#xD;
"Richard what is the matter with you? I didn't interfere in&#xD;
your bargain with my boy, because I know, that you are not the&#xD;
man to do a thing without a cause. But yet your explanation is&#xD;
'not forthcoming and I must confess, that I am curious, to receive&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Patience Caroline" he answered "my explanation was already&#xD;
coming; but I have to tell you so many things to-day and things&#xD;
of such importance, that I was arranging them in my mind, in or-&#xD;
der not to forget any of them. Now I am prepared."&#xD;
He broke off, but after a few moments he resumed:&#xD;
"Let me go back a piece, Caroline, back to the time, when you&#xD;
and I were children, children of poor parents, but happy withal.&#xD;
We were constant playmates, you recollect and Richard Wood&#xD;
was of'nothing more fond and proud, than of his cousinCaroline.&#xD;
'Was it not so, madam ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Fox seemed somewhat uneasy, even annoyed at his way..&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       69&#xD;
"May be it was, Richard;" she answered "but what is the use&#xD;
of calling up these recollections? If that was your only pur-&#xD;
pose-"&#xD;
"Stop Caroline, do not form hasty conclusions. I said that&#xD;
Richard Wood was fond and proud of his cousin and his fond-&#xD;
ness grew with his years. I was a passionate boy, you know, and&#xD;
when my fondness changed into love, it was no common passion,&#xD;
but one that rooted deeply in my soul and could not be torn out&#xD;
but at the expense of life."&#xD;
"But Richard ..-  theLady said with evident uneasiness.&#xD;
Your words are painful to me; please desist...."&#xD;
"Desist?" Why, Caroline, you might as well order Vesuvius&#xD;
to stop, when with a mighty inner pressure he bursts the bowels&#xD;
of the earth, hurling rocks and lava to the sky. No, madam, I&#xD;
have been silent long enough and even if I wished to remain so&#xD;
longer I could not. Painful? what does it matter? You may&#xD;
well afford to endure a moment's pain after the long years of suf-&#xD;
fering you have caused me."&#xD;
Mrs. Fox said nothing, though it was evident, that she was the&#xD;
prey of conflicting emotions..&#xD;
"Yes, I loved you deeply, sincerely, passionately then and if you&#xD;
had consented to be mine, I would have been like wax in your&#xD;
hands and you might have made an honest man of me; you might&#xD;
have even inspired me for great achievements and enabled me to&#xD;
write my name on the tablets of fame."&#xD;
Again he paused ; but if he expected a reply, he was mistaken.&#xD;
Mrs. Fox sat still and motionless, with her head averted, with&#xD;
only the violent trembling of her hands betraying her deep emo-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"You chose the contrary" he resumed "and by casting me off&#xD;
sealed my fate. My passion, which if requited, would have made&#xD;
me foremost among the good, drove me irresistibly to wicked&#xD;
oghts and evil practices, when spurned."&#xD;
"Richard" she now broke in with a faltering voice "your me-&#xD;
mory serves you wrong, for your love was not spurned; only...'&#xD;
Oh! I remember well enough" he said bitterly "you said you&#xD;
loved me in return but you had more ambition yet than love.&#xD;
You ridiculed the idea of love in a hut and insisted:upon the ne-&#xD;
cessity of wealth and position, to keep love alive and prevent it&#xD;

from becoming a bane instead of a blessing. You bade me wait&#xD;
-and strive and while I waited and strove, you accepted the hand&#xD;
of a man, you did not love, merely because he offered you at once&#xD;
what with me lay in a distant and very uncertain future."&#xD;
"I shall not dwell upon the period of wretchedness that follow-&#xD;
ed your marriage" he continued, when she did not reply "I shall&#xD;
not tell you of the awful thoughts of suicide, of murder to which&#xD;
I then fell a prey. Yes your life and his were in imminent dang-&#xD;
er for months in succession and if I spared you, it was, because&#xD;
my hope refused to die and because my vengeance was not satis-&#xD;
fied with the mere death of him, that shut on me the gates of&#xD;
-paradise. I lived and suffered him to live, in order to henceforth&#xD;
entertain no other thought, no other purpose but vengeance. For&#xD;
that purpose I sold myself into his service, worked for him day&#xD;
andnight and played the faithful friend, to gain his confidence&#xD;
and thus the power to destroy him. Vengeance was my meat&#xD;
and drink, vengeance und another passion. Caroline, when you,&#xD;
a bride, stepped from your father's house and saw despair in&#xD;
your wretched cousin's eye, you took his hand and whispered in-&#xD;
to his ear a word of consolation, which alone prevented him from&#xD;
turning mad. Caroline, say, do you recollect ?"&#xD;
He tried to catch her eye, but failed.&#xD;
You must remember" he continued "for I 'cannot believe, that&#xD;
wanton cruelty should have ,dictated those words of comfort.&#xD;
You said : Richard, live, love and hope ! Well, Caroline, I have&#xD;
lived, I have hoped, I still love as ardently as ever: say, will my&#xD;
patience be rewarded?"&#xD;
Mrs. Fox was evidently crushed by this confession and the ex-&#xD;
pectation connected with it.&#xD;
"0 Richard !" she cried "this comes so unexpectedly. After&#xD;
a long silence of 16 years, this passionate avowal. How can you&#xD;
hold the wife, the mother of grown children responsible for the&#xD;
foolish promise of a thoughtless girl."&#xD;
"Thoughtless you were not, Caroline- A girl, who can disre-&#xD;
gard the dictates of her heart and sell herself for mammon,is not&#xD;
thoughtless. Nor can this my avowal come altogether unexpect-&#xD;
ed. Has not my life during these 16 years of slavery been one&#xD;
act of devotion and fidelity to you? . Have I not on all occasions&#xD;
taken care of your interest at the expense of his? Have I not&#xD;

DOLORES.                        71&#xD;
endeavored to accumulate large sums, which at any moment are&#xD;
at your disposal?"&#xD;
"I think by dividing these sums with you, I have fairly paid&#xD;
you for your services" she said with a slight touch of sarcasm.&#xD;
"Paid? no, you have not paid me; for what is money to me&#xD;
without you, to share it? When I agreed to take my poition. it&#xD;
was merely to gain your consent for the measure and to invest it&#xD;
for you as a faithful steward."&#xD;
"But Richard, this sudden disclosure almost overwhelms me :&#xD;
why do you speak now, after so long a silence?"&#xD;
"Because I knew, that you wanted gold and that wihout it, you&#xD;
would reject me as readily now as sixteen years ago. To gain&#xD;
you, I needed gold and to get gold, I have plotted hard, using&#xD;
fair means and foul and now after a servitude longer than Jacob's&#xD;
I step before you, to receive my compensation: am I to be cheat-&#xD;
ed out of it?"&#xD;
His language became threatening, but it did not displease Mrs.&#xD;
Fox. She had something in her nature, which understood such&#xD;
fierce wooing and perhaps was fascinated more by it, than she&#xD;
would have beenlby sweet and flattering persuasion. She dislik-&#xD;
ed her husband for nothing more, than his easy yielding disposi-&#xD;
tion, though-strange contradiction-she was very ready to bene-&#xD;
fit by it and rule him with a rod of iron. There was undoubted-&#xD;
ly a genial element in the pair, now driving in that buggy and if&#xD;
she hesitated, to grant his wishes, it was more the fear of the cen-&#xD;
sure of the world, that would fall on the guilty wife, than any&#xD;
serious scruple of her conscience. So wavering between the wish&#xD;
to gratify him and the fear of the unavoidable consequences of&#xD;
such a step, she said:&#xD;
'But Richard, be reasonable! Consider what you ask? Re-&#xD;
member what abuse the world would heap upon the, faithless wife&#xD;
and mother."&#xD;
They would say nothing, Caroline, fqr do you think, that I&#xD;
would expose the woman of my love to idle gossip? No let me&#xD;
see to that; only requite my love and I'll shelter you against the&#xD;
world."&#xD;
"How can you avoid such censure Richard? If I were weak&#xD;
enough to follow your dictate and that of a silly heart: how could&#xD;
you avoid, exposing me to the censure of the public?"&#xD;

"Let that be my care Caroline. If you belong to me, I shall&#xD;
have strength and cunning sufficient, to accomplish anything."&#xD;
"Then-you-you do not-do not purpose to take me from&#xD;
my house?"&#xD;
Shame was as yet alive and made her stammer but "it is only&#xD;
the first step, that costs" the adage says and when we see the&#xD;
fallen woman again, we shall no longer notice the blush of shame&#xD;
upon her cheek.&#xD;
"Not for the present, Caroline. My plans are not mature;&#xD;
though the time may not be far distant when I can claim you&#xD;
openly and fearlessly before the world."&#xD;
"But Richard how can I dare to step before him and my child-&#xD;
ren witha guilty conscience? I'd sink into the ground with&#xD;
shame."&#xD;
"Before that dolt? before a man, who is no man? whom you&#xD;
cannot help despising with all your heart? Come'dear Caroline,,&#xD;
you surely are not weak enough for that !"&#xD;
Thus he spoke to her, now flattering and persuading-now us-&#xD;
ing threats and fierce exclamations, until at last, he reached his,&#xD;
object. Indeed the battle was not very obstinate: a woman ready&#xD;
to scorn and ridicule her husband, will not be slow, to dishonor&#xD;
him.......&#xD;
That evening Mrs. Fox did not return to her house the unpol-&#xD;
luted wife, she had left it.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
AN .ADVENTURE.&#xD;
It was now late in October and Dolores had just taken her&#xD;
abode in the parsonage. Usually the family of the mansion had&#xD;
left for town three weeks sooner ; but this time for a- wonder&#xD;
Mrs. Fox had been the cause of delay. She seemed all at, once-&#xD;
to take an interest in nature, which had never been noticed in her&#xD;
before, and almost daily planned excursions into the surround--&#xD;
ing country., Mr. Fox also loved nature; but not exactly in his&#xD;
wife's company and-felt grateful to Mr. Wood for offering to take&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES                         73&#xD;
charge of her on such occasions. He preferred to stroll about&#xD;
with Lucy and Dolores, the latter of which had by this time&#xD;
plunged into her studies with a zest, that promised great results.&#xD;
She had recovered her buoyant spirit and even gained more flesh,&#xD;
than she had lost, and when Mr. Fox told her how proud he was&#xD;
of her on account of Mr. Goodman's praise, a perfect radiance lit&#xD;
up her countenance.. Besides, she thought, she noticed a change&#xD;
in Mrs. Fox' conduct towards her and the hope of sooner or later&#xD;
gaining her love, contributed much to her present happiness.&#xD;
Now however they had all left and Dolores shared the company&#xD;
of the minister and his sister. True, the parting from her foster-&#xD;
father had made her sad; A ehad already learned to love and&#xD;
respect her new friends by that time and the assurance of an ear-&#xD;
ly reunion would not suffer her to be dejected any length of time.&#xD;
Indeed she had no leisure for sadness. Her studies were so in-&#xD;
teresting and nature, in spite of the lateness of the season, was so&#xD;
beautitul! In fact its beauty had rather increased, than diminish-&#xD;
ed; for Jack Frost had already at nights bitten the leaves of the&#xD;
trees and thus clothed them in their magnificent dresses of gold&#xD;
and scarlet and purple and brown. They were evidently enjoy-&#xD;
ing their carnival before a long winter and only give way/the ar-&#xD;
rival of frolicsome spring.&#xD;
The nuts were ripe and in spare hours Dolores in the company&#xD;
of gallant Charles Fuchs would scour the woods and return with&#xD;
heavy baskets full of the precious fruit, that was to shorten the&#xD;
long evening hours of winter. The intimacy between the pair,&#xD;
which -a similar disposition had created, had been enhanced by&#xD;
the pursuit of kindred studies- True, Charles was far in advance&#xD;
of Dolores; but they had the same teacher, studied in the same&#xD;
room and, what was more.possessed the same thirst of knowledge.&#xD;
It was really wonderful, what progress Dolores made. The child&#xD;
did not seem to acquire by any effort; the knowledge seemed al-&#xD;
ready to lie within her and only to require the touch of the teach-&#xD;
er's magic wand, to spring into sight. To say, that Mr. Good-&#xD;
man was surprised, would hardly describe that gentleman's emo-&#xD;
tion. He was amazed; he did not understand it; but con d only&#xD;
second Mr. Fox' statement, when that gentleman had said: it lies&#xD;
within her ; she is as good as wise, a perfect little wonder. Yet&#xD;
she was childlike withal, not one of your precious women, whose&#xD;

maturity is produced by the sting of the worm eating its way to&#xD;
the core. Her amiability captivated all, she came in contact with&#xD;
and Charles who had no sisters, doted upon her with the fondness&#xD;
of a brother. Though reserved and even somewhat domineering&#xD;
to other children, including Henry-the consequence of the hom-&#xD;
age involuntarily paid by inferior minds to those superior-he&#xD;
was all gentleness and attention to Dolores, humoring her wishes&#xD;
and even guessing those, she hesitated to express.&#xD;
Thus far, they had not found a chance, to carry out the long&#xD;
cherished plan of a sailing excursion in Charlie's boat; but as the&#xD;
season was getting late, bringing squally weather and sudden&#xD;
changes, they agreed, that the next fair day should be made a&#xD;
holiday and devoted to that purpose. So when one Saturday&#xD;
morning the sun rose in a cloudless sky, with merely a gentle&#xD;
breeze creating a rustle in the leaves, Charles and Henry appear-&#xD;
ed at the parsonage dressed in their sailor suits and summoned&#xD;
Dolores, to prepare for the trip without.delay. The child requi-&#xD;
red no urging ; in less than 10 minutes she stood before her&#xD;
friends ready to receive Miss Sarah's warnings to be cautious&#xD;
and the large basket containing all the dainties that were to grace&#xD;
the voyage.&#xD;
"Do, Child be careful now" she enjoined for the thirtieth time&#xD;
"and you Charles take good care of her, my lad."&#xD;
"Never fear, Miss Sarah. You know, I would not for the world&#xD;
expose Dolores; so rest easy on that score. But now we must&#xD;
depart or noon will be upon us before we know it. Good bye&#xD;
Miss Sarah."&#xD;
So off they went, taking With them the best wishes of the par-&#xD;
son and his sister. The walk to the bay consumed only a few&#xD;
minutes and was soon accomplished by these young elastic feet.&#xD;
Now they reached the boat and Dolores was helped in and the&#xD;
basket with the provissions depositetlin a box at the stern, the&#xD;
cover of which served as a seat. Next Charles jumped in erect&#xD;
ing the mast and getting the sail in order, while Henry loosened&#xD;
the chain, ready to drop it and follow his brother into the boat.&#xD;
"All right!" cries Charles, a spring of Henry and the sail be-&#xD;
gins to fill and propel the light vessel over the water. Charles&#xD;
sits at the stern, with one hand handling the rudder and with the&#xD;
&#xD;

other the line, that regulates the sail. Henry is in the bow&#xD;
watching for his brother's words of command and ready to ex-&#xD;
ecute them on the spot. At Charles side sits Dolores, with flut-&#xD;
tering heart, all excitement at the novelty of the amusement, but&#xD;
not yet all delight. Charles laughes at her, when she seizes his&#xD;
arm with a nervous grasp at any sudden turn of the boat; but&#xD;
soon she gets used to its motions and then no longer furnishes&#xD;
stuff for merriment. Her fear subsides; but her excitement re-&#xD;
maining, assumes the character of pure delight. Now leaning&#xD;
over board and letting her fingers trail through the water, now&#xD;
clasping her hands in extacy over some new point of beauty re-&#xD;
vealing itself to her eye; now laughing, at Charles quaint remarks&#xD;
or amusing the boys in return by those of her own invention,&#xD;
she was the very picture of happiness and assumed a radiant&#xD;
beauty, such as Charles had never noticed in her before.&#xD;
"Dolores" he said smiling "I really think, the water is your&#xD;
element, I shouldn't wonder much, to see you suddenly change&#xD;
into a water fairy and return to the element, from which you may&#xD;
be, were taken merely by mistake."&#xD;
"Why Charles, yes, that would be fun. To live down there&#xD;
amongst the pretty fishes, in palaces of corals and seaweeds :&#xD;
wouldn't it be splendid?"&#xD;
"I don't know about that, Dol. I have'nt much of a taste for&#xD;
brine as a beverage."&#xD;
"Oh water-faries don't drink salt water, Charles.' They live on&#xD;
goldfish and sea stars, you know."&#xD;
"I don't know whether I should like them any better."&#xD;
"Oh you are hard to please Charles, I know your mother spoils&#xD;
you with all the dainties she cooks and bakes for you. But I do&#xD;
say, it would be fun, to live down there and surprise you when&#xD;
sailing in your boat, by diving from 'the water."&#xD;
"Well, Dol, it might be fun for you, but then what should we&#xD;
(1 without you? 1tiss Sarah would make a pretty fuss indeed&#xD;
on learning that you had turned a ;sprite."&#xD;
"Why yes, I see it wouldn't answer at all Charles. Miss Sarah&#xD;
might miss me and Mr. Fox surely would. So I wont dive yet&#xD;
for a while. But Charles what are you doing? Ain't we going too&#xD;
far from shore?"&#xD;
"Why no, that is the fun. I see the wind is getting favorable&#xD;

&#xD;
for a good cruise and I am bound, to show you the sailing quali-&#xD;
ties of the mermaid."&#xD;
Dolores had implicit faith in her companion's skill and strength&#xD;
so she acquiesed in his decision and instead of fretting abandon-&#xD;
ed herself to a full enjoyment of the hour. Receiving the wind&#xD;
from the rear at an obtuse angle with her course, the boat cut&#xD;
the waves with the rapidity of the seabird and thereby created in&#xD;
the bosom of the girl the pleasure always engendered by rapid&#xD;
motion. Her curls fluttering in the wind, her eyes dilated her&#xD;
mouth drinking eagerly the bracing air she revelled in the beau-&#xD;
ties of the ocean with an abandonment, which pleased and flatter-&#xD;
ed Charles. It was he, that had procured this recreation for Dol-&#xD;
ores .and he was gratified to see her so delighted. Since the above&#xD;
remarks no words had been exchanged between the trio; they&#xD;
seemed too happy, to speak much, thus verifying the truth, that&#xD;
great bliss inclines to pensiveness rather than boisterous mirth.&#xD;
At last Dolores remarked:&#xD;
"Charles you promised the other day, to tell me some beauti-&#xD;
ful fairy tale; supposing you do it now. I think it would be&#xD;
doubly beautiful on the sea."&#xD;
"Perhaps you are right Dolores ; but I wish you knew german,&#xD;
the tales I know are german tales and they sound much prettier&#xD;
in that language than in any other."&#xD;
"German? yes you told me, your parents are germans, coming&#xD;
from a beautiful country beyond the sea. I wish, I knew german."&#xD;
"So do I Dolores ; it would give you access to so many beauti-&#xD;
ful books."&#xD;
"Is it very hard to learn?"&#xD;
"It is not very easy Dol, but you could learn it easily enough."&#xD;
"Would you teach me Charles?"&#xD;
Of course, I would. Strange, that I never thought of this be-&#xD;
fore."&#xD;
"Why no Charles, it is not so very strange. We have'nt known&#xD;
one another so long yet."&#xD;
"I know Dol, we haven't; but still it, seems to Ine, as if I had&#xD;
known you all the while."&#xD;
"And so it seems to me Charles. I suppose it is, because we&#xD;
are such very good friends together. But as to german, tell me&#xD;
the name of one of your stories in german."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        77&#xD;
"Oh! Dol, there are so many of them, that it is hard to pick.&#xD;
There is for instance "Dornroeschen."&#xD;
"Dornroeschen?" Dolores said with an accent so correct, as if&#xD;
she had spoken german all her life, "why that is not hard to un-&#xD;
derstand; it sounds familiar to me, say: doesn't it mean as much&#xD;
as "Briarrose?"&#xD;
"Of course it does" Charles said with a look of surprise "Dol&#xD;
you are a strange girl, I never saw one like you before."&#xD;
"Why am I strange Charles ?"&#xD;
"Because yon know everything beforehand. Mr. Goodman says&#xD;
you do and you will soon excel me, if I don't look out ; he says."&#xD;
"Pshaw! Charlie, you are making fun of me."&#xD;
"Not the least, Dolores. You are a strange girl and I shouldn't&#xD;
at all wonder, to see you turn into a mermaid in good earnest,"&#xD;
"I like that word "Dornroeschen" said Dolores abruptly, as if&#xD;
she wanted to change the conversation: "but I should like to&#xD;
know some more; try me on another name."&#xD;
"Schneewitchen" then."&#xD;
"Oh; you take easy ones. Every body might know that that&#xD;
means Snowwhite."&#xD;
"No indeed, every body wouldn't; for every body isn't Dolor-&#xD;
es. But here is another:&#xD;
"Aschenpuddel"&#xD;
"Why that is some one, who puddles in the ashes; if german is&#xD;
no harder than that, I'll soon know it"&#xD;
"I shouldn't wonder, if you knew it now" the boy replied "Lis-&#xD;
ten and see whether you don't."&#xD;
And then he began the pretty story of Briarrose in his moth-&#xD;
er's tongue, which I shall not repeat here. On the one hand it&#xD;
is familiar to almost every body; on the other I am afraid but few&#xD;
of my readers would understand it; for with all due respect to&#xD;
them in regard to the german language I think with Charlie, that&#xD;
they would not be all of them like Dolores.&#xD;
While Charlie spoke and at the same time keenly eyed her,&#xD;
Dolores sat like one dreaming. It was evident from the expres-&#xD;
sion of her face, which varied with the modulations of the story,&#xD;
that the words beat not meaningless against her ear but reached&#xD;
the seat of understanding; but it was clear at* the same time, that&#xD;
e impression was by no means distinct and well defined. The&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7070-00000040"/>&#xD;
girl listened more with her instinct, as it were, than with her rea-&#xD;
son, or rather like one, that listens to something far away and in&#xD;
spite of strenuous efforts, only succeeds in getting a faint idea of&#xD;
the meaning. Nevertheless, when Dolores related to Charles the'&#xD;
-story, as she had understood it, he was so astonished, that he was&#xD;
scarcely able, to tell her so.&#xD;
"Dolores, you are making fun of me now? he said positively..&#xD;
You do understand german."&#xD;
"If I do, I didn't know it."&#xD;
"Were you, ever in Germany?"&#xD;
"I was not, Charlie."&#xD;
"But you were with Germans in this country?"         .&#xD;
"I may have been, Charlie; but never long, at, least I do not.&#xD;
recollect of ever hearing words like those you spoke before."&#xD;
"Your father came from Italy ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"And your mother ?"&#xD;
"Came from there too, for all I know."&#xD;
"Wonderful, wonderful !" he muttered and for a while became&#xD;
very silent, evidently turning this enigma over and over in his&#xD;
mind, without finding a solution. From this silence his broth-,&#xD;
er's voice roused him.&#xD;
"Charles" he said, if you want to go to the cemetery to-day, it&#xD;
is time to shift. It must be past twelve and we have a long tack&#xD;
to go there."&#xD;
Charles looked at the sun and nodded.&#xD;
"You are right Henry" he replied. "I had got into a brown&#xD;
study."&#xD;
The sail was shifted and the boat obeying the new impulse, no&#xD;
longer stood into the sea, but in a diagonal line approached the&#xD;
shore in a north-western direction. They might there be about&#xD;
two miles from the coast and from the course of the boat Dolor-&#xD;
es judged, that they would strike land about the same distance-&#xD;
above the harbor from which they had started. The name ceme-&#xD;
tery had struck the girl and after pondering upon its possible,&#xD;
character in this connection, she at last inquired :&#xD;
"Henry spoke about a cemetery. I wasn't aware that there is&#xD;
a place of that kind at the coast about here."&#xD;
&#xD;
"There isn't either, Dol. Only the people call it so from the&#xD;
many rocks, which stand in the water, tombstone fashion."&#xD;
"O yes, I recollect now. Miss Sarah spoke about such a'place&#xD;
the other day, saying it was haunted."&#xD;
"You know, what that  ans Dol?'&#xD;
"Of course, I do, thong I dont believe in it. It means, that it&#xD;
is visited by ghosts,"&#xD;
,'Ain't you afraid of ghosts, Dol ?"&#xD;
"Not a bit Charlie, for there ain't any."&#xD;
"Well I dont know, some say there ain't, but other's swear, there&#xD;
are and that they have seen them. I hope you arte not afraid to&#xD;
go to such a place ?"&#xD;
"No Charlie, I am not" the girl said so quietly, that the boy&#xD;
had no reason to doubt her word, and therefore continued to hold&#xD;
his boat in a position,.that would effect his purpose.&#xD;
"I have my special reason, Dol, to go to the cemetery" he said&#xD;
"I have been told, that there is an eagle's nest somewhere up&#xD;
there and I shall try, to get the young ones."&#xD;
"You haven't been there then very lately, Charlie?"&#xD;
"No Dol, to tell the truth, I have never been there yet."&#xD;
"Why, that is funny: you aint afraid?"&#xD;
"Of course I am not, but other people are, you know."&#xD;
He winked at his brother.&#xD;
"You mean Henry is? But that need not keep you away."&#xD;
"I know, but mother is afraid and she always made me promise&#xD;
not to, go."&#xD;
"And you would disobey her to-day Charles?" the girl said&#xD;
with a touch of reproach.&#xD;
"No, not exactly Dol.  The truth is, she didn't make me&#xD;
promise to-day."&#xD;
"Perhaps she forgot."&#xD;
"May be, she did Dol" he said with a laugh, "but that is her&#xD;
lookout and not mine, you know. I am bound, to benefit by the&#xD;
chance and try for the eagles. But Henry, what is the matter?&#xD;
What are you doing?"&#xD;
"Getting my fishing tackle ready, Charly. I promised mother&#xD;
some fish and want you, to put me off on the rocky island. You&#xD;
know, they bite well there, and when you come back, I expect to&#xD;
have more than mother wants."&#xD;

&#xD;
"What a thoughtful boy and dutiful son! Charles exclaimed&#xD;
with a touch of sarcasm and a wink at Dolores. "Henry isn't a&#xD;
bit afraid, not lie; but then mother wants fish, you know and so&#xD;
he can't visit the cemetery."&#xD;
"Henry colored slightly and the glance he cast at his brother&#xD;
was anything but friendly., But when Dolores laughed he joined,&#xD;
in the chorus, probably thinking, that it was the best thing he&#xD;
could do. Nothing more was said about his motives; but Char-.&#xD;
les resumed:&#xD;
"Dol, the rocky island is well worth seeing; and as it is noon&#xD;
and time, to think of dinner, we may as well cast anchor th ere&#xD;
and take our meal on '-terra firma."&#xD;
This proposition was agreed to and the course continued. By&#xD;
this time the characteristic features of the coast began to show&#xD;
themselves. While the main shore rose in high crags of more than&#xD;
100 feet almost perpendicularly, masses of scattered rocks from&#xD;
5 to 10 feet high at the time of the tide rose from the water, re-&#xD;
sembling to a certain degree the tombstones of a gravyard, es-&#xD;
pecjally when seen from the distance, and thus justifying the po-&#xD;
)ular appellation, of the cemetery which, as above mentioned, had&#xD;
been bestowed upon it by the country people. Being of limestone&#xD;
the rocks by their whitish color strengthened the impression.&#xD;
Near the coast they gradually grew higher, thereby creating the&#xD;
idea, that the graveyard was situated on a hillside, exposing to&#xD;
gaze almost every monument. The flat rock, which Henry had&#xD;
honored with the name of "island" was the only exception from&#xD;
the general rule, in as far as it had not the shape of a thin pillar,&#xD;
but of a table rock some 3 feet above water at ordinary tide and&#xD;
about 20 'feet square. It was a short distance from the other&#xD;
rocks, appearing to stand to them in the same relation of fore-&#xD;
runner, which they themselves sustained to the main shore. The&#xD;
water around this island was deep and free of reefs and as an iron&#xD;
ring had been riveted in the rock, our travellers found no diffi-&#xD;
culty in fastening their boat to the island.&#xD;
"In the name of my sovereign queen, Dolores di Gatana, I take&#xD;
possession of this island." Charles said with a laugh, springing&#xD;
on the rock and swinging his straw hat. Then turning to the&#xD;
boat, he bowed with mock reverence and said:&#xD;
"Does it please your Majesty to dine on her newly-gained soil&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
-rock I meant to say-or does she prefer the shadow of the&#xD;
sail?"&#xD;
"The sail will be more acceptable for the repast" Dolores said&#xD;
with graceful condescension, happily imitating the style of her&#xD;
friend; "but I must confess, that I am well inclined, to pay a&#xD;
visit to this land of mine, to acquaint myself with its manners,&#xD;
and customs and to let the sun of my royal grace shine upon its&#xD;
inhabitants. Stewart, you will in my absence make due prepar-&#xD;
ations for a pleasant meal, for it pleases my royal stomach, to&#xD;
share the weakness of common mortals, so vulgarly called hung-&#xD;
er. And now Sir Chamberlain, if you will reach me your loyal&#xD;
right, I shall endeavor, to ascend my rocky realm."&#xD;
Charles in silence did her bidding. He had made up his mind&#xD;
hence not to wonder at anything he might see in this little creat-&#xD;
tire ; for the grace and dignity with which she spoke, was truly&#xD;
marvelous and would have done credit to Any real princess.&#xD;
Walking around on the rock the pair enjoyed the beauty of the&#xD;
scenery, especially the view on the rocks, which from that spot&#xD;
was really grand. The white pillars looming from the deep with&#xD;
their bases washed by the rippling waves, offering a great variety&#xD;
in their fantastic forms, rising gradually to the height of the&#xD;
crags composing the shore; here and there crowding closely to-&#xD;
gether, while at other places they allowed rooms for little basins,&#xD;
whose watery bottom however remained invisible-these pillars,&#xD;
I say were well worthy examining and Charles and Dolores hast-&#xD;
ened to their meal, in order, to be able, to commence their ex-&#xD;
ploring expedition as soon as possible.&#xD;
Henry had already brought forth the basket with the eatables&#xD;
of Miss Sarah's concoction and their -savory nature in connec-&#xD;
tion with the good appetite of the adventurers made then disap-&#xD;
pear fast.&#xD;
When they had finished, Henry took his tackle, jumped on the&#xD;
rock and loosening the rope, allowed the boat to yield to the pres-&#xD;
sure of the tide which was near its height and gently carried the&#xD;
the boat towards the rocks. The sail had been furled, and the&#xD;
mast taken down, because they were of no benefit amongst the&#xD;
crags, and a pair of oars in the hands of Charles were used to&#xD;
propel the boat instead. The young man handled them with ex-&#xD;

emplary skill; but before entering the labyrinth, he stopped a&#xD;
moment.                                                b&#xD;
"Henry" he said "hadn't you better come along? We may be&#xD;
hours in returning and in case of ennui you'd have no means of&#xD;
reaching the shore without us"&#xD;
"Never mind Charles: you know I am fond of fishing and shall&#xD;
think the hours too short, if anything."&#xD;
"But, Henry, we might be prevented from returning at all, by&#xD;
getting entangled in one of these many channels."&#xD;
"That wouldn't better my case much. Charlie" Henry said&#xD;
laughing "on the contrary, under such circumstances I could&#xD;
benefit you, instead of being benefitted. Mother knows, that I&#xD;
meant to fish here; if we aint back at dusk, she'll cause a boat to&#xD;
come in search of us."&#xD;
"Well, as you please. May be you are right. Good bye Henry&#xD;
and much pleasure to you.'"&#xD;
Henry's "likewise" was still echoing among the rocks, when&#xD;
the boat had already turned the corner and gone out of sight.&#xD;
They swam in a channel or rather a multitude of channels, which&#xD;
were so like one another, that strangers found great difficulty in&#xD;
distinguishing the right one. Charles noticed this from the first&#xD;
and with a readiness and circumspection, which would have done&#xD;
credit to a navigator of experience, he impressed certain features&#xD;
of the rocks around him on his mind. Still this was all he could&#xD;
do and so he begged Dolores to keep a lookout for game, laying&#xD;
his gun in reach of his hand, in case an eagle or other bird should&#xD;
present itself. Dolores would have liked to know more about&#xD;
the story of this strange place, since Charles had intimated, that"&#xD;
he was aquainted with it ; but seeing that he was too busy, to&#xD;
narrate it just then, she curbed her curiosity and waiting for a&#xD;
favorable opportunity, eagerly send her eyes around in search of&#xD;
game. Nothing however would present itself and the solemn si-&#xD;
lence of the place, rather deepened than broken by the rippling&#xD;
of the water or the clashing of the oars, fell like a damper upon&#xD;
the gay spirit of the girl. At one of those basins, I have men-&#xD;
tioned, Chairles stopped his boat and said:&#xD;
"So Dol; here let us halt a while and look around us. This&#xD;
basin must serve us as a landmark, to shape our course; if we'&#xD;
forget our entrance, my whole trouble will be in vain. Do you&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        83&#xD;
see these two rocks together, looking like a pair of weatherbeat-&#xD;
en salts in their overalls? Very well; our channel lies between&#xD;
them. Now for our next steps. It is hard to say, in which&#xD;
tion the shore lies. These rocks are getting so high, that they&#xD;
exclude the sight of everything, even that of the sun."&#xD;
"But not his shadow" Dolores suggested.&#xD;
Charles started.&#xD;
"Dol, you are a jewel" he said "the smartest little thing that&#xD;
ever wore skirts. You think of things, that escaped this&#xD;
head of mine. To the deuce with all my measures of precaution-&#xD;
If on returning we can't see the sun, the shadow will indicate&#xD;
our course."&#xD;
But the sky may cloud up."&#xD;
"Oh well, the world may perish, for that matter; one mustn't&#xD;
always expect the woi-st.."&#xD;
So they went on, directing their course by keeping the sunlit&#xD;
side of the rocks to their right.&#xD;
"Can't you-tell me now, what the people say about this place&#xD;
Charlie?" Dolores inquired.&#xD;
"Why' yes, I may as well; it isn't much though and nonsense&#xD;
at best. The story goes that many years ago aoiratenfrequented&#xD;
this place, hiding his vessel and his treasures in s?me cave in the&#xD;
crags. One day, while on sea, he fell in with aman-of-wa  th&#xD;
had been in search of him. It was too late to run away and&#xD;
moreover the pirate was not much inclined to run. So in spite of&#xD;
heavy odds against him he accepted fight and skillfully baffled all&#xD;
the efforts of his foes, to take him. At last however his mast&#xD;
was shot away; the ship became unmanagable and the crew of&#xD;
the man-of-war succeeded in boarding his vessel. The cread-&#xD;
ful hand-to-hand fight ensued, in which no quarter was given &#xD;
either side. The pirates fought with desparation, their captain&#xD;
at their head: they never yielded; until, receiving the mortal&#xD;
wound, they would fall on the deck, never to arise. At r last the&#xD;
captain alone was left. Seeing his comrades dead, he benefitted&#xD;
by the dusk of evening, which in the meantime had crept upon the&#xD;
vessels, and jumping into the sea, succeeded in reaching a little&#xD;
boat, that, ad been trailing behind his vessel ath ing ot&#xD;
the figh.'0utig hero      beginning of&#xD;

ships and. by,-meanso  aro  as h    reeadtetd          n&#xD;

reached the neighboring shore and his hiding place. But he saw&#xD;
so much exhausted, that he fell upon the ground in a fit of faint-&#xD;
ing, never to awaken again. The wounds he had received in the&#xD;
fight, though not mortal of themselves, had become fatal in con-&#xD;
sequence of the loss'of blood. Slowly, but surely the flood of&#xD;
life was oozing out, until at last the vital spark became extinct&#xD;
and the wicked, but brave buccaneer lay a corpse upon the beach,&#xD;
that hid his treasures."&#xD;
"That story makes me shudder, Charlie" Dolores said after a&#xD;
pause "but yet I like it. Does the story not tell the pirate's&#xD;
name ?"&#xD;
"It does" he replied with a light hesitancy "it calls him Fox.'&#xD;
"Fox? why, it is funny, he should be called like my father.'"&#xD;
"It is, Dol and what is queerer yet, malignant tongues whisper&#xD;
of a relationship between the pirate and the family of the man-&#xD;
sion. But this is all nonsense of course. I dont believe the part&#xD;
relating to the man's existance, much less that one connecting&#xD;
him with our Mr. Fox.'"&#xD;
"Nor I Charlie" she said with indignation. "To think of it!&#xD;
My good foster-father the relation of a bloodthirsty pirate!"&#xD;
"It isn't likely, Dol; tho' stranger things have happened for&#xD;
that matter. But here is another basin and-let me see-yes&#xD;
surely, that is the shore. Do you s'ee, how the crags are hanging.&#xD;
together on top?"&#xD;
"Yes Charlie; but at the bottom are large fissures. May be,&#xD;
we can pass through."&#xD;
"I'll soon find out Dol. Look out, that you dont strike your&#xD;
head against some prQjecting edge. But what is this? Oh Dol,&#xD;
how beautiful !"&#xD;
This exclamation s drawn from him by the strange beauty&#xD;
of the place, which they had reached on passing through the fis-&#xD;
sure. The sky was no longer over head: but a dome like vault&#xD;
of limestone rock loomed more than 50 feet above instead. Nar-&#xD;
row fissures on the sides and the top admitted the rays of the&#xD;
sun, which, flitting like as many streaks of gold through the vault&#xD;
lit up the space with a colored light of a subdued brightness.&#xD;
The bottom consisted partly of water, partly of snow-white sand&#xD;
on which in one corner several bones and a scull became visible.&#xD;
On the right the water entered into another fissure, naturally sug.-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        85&#xD;
gesting the idea, that the cave continued on that side. The place&#xD;
was extremely beautiful, though showing a beauty in which the&#xD;
august and even awful predominated.&#xD;
When Charles had uttered the above exclamation, the boat&#xD;
grated on the sand and with the impulse of the lass store glided&#xD;
far enough up, to remain fastened. Charles sprang on shore and&#xD;
reaching his hand to Dolores, assisting her in also gaining the&#xD;
ground. They looked around like bewildered and, when they no-&#xD;
ticed the bones, the girl drew nearer to her companion.&#xD;
"The pirate's cave!" she cried half loud.&#xD;
"Yes and his skeleton" he replied.. "I begin to believe that&#xD;
there is.something in the story after all. But isn't that lovely?&#xD;
I could almost fancy a freebooter's life with such an abode to&#xD;
dwell in."&#xD;
"And such a death to die" Dolores said "no Charlie you would&#xD;
do no such thing."&#xD;
"May be, I wouldn't Dol" he said laughing "but if the story is&#xD;
true so far, may be that part about the fellow's treasures is also&#xD;
correct. We must bring a pick, and shovel, to dig for them."&#xD;
The girl shuddered.&#xD;
"I wouldn't want money, on which the blood of poor murder-&#xD;
ed people is sticking" she said. "Come- Charlie, let us leave this&#xD;
place; it makes a person feel so wild and wicked."&#xD;
"Little goosy !" he said with a laugh "you wild and wicked? I&#xD;
defy any place to make you wicked."&#xD;
"Well I don't care, I am afraid and wish to leave."&#xD;
"If that is so, I suppose, I'll have to humor you. But before&#xD;
we go, let me examine that fissure just for a moment. You see&#xD;
there is a strip of dry sand along the water, which will enable us,&#xD;
to pass with dry feet."&#xD;
She yielded with evident reluclance; but his ardent desire of&#xD;
farther discoveries made him for once disregard her wishes. Tak-&#xD;
ing his shot gun on his shoulder and extanding his hand to his&#xD;
companion, he walked with her towards the fissure mentioned&#xD;
and following the strip of dry sand soon reached another cave of&#xD;
smaller dimensions but similar character, whieh howeves was&#xD;
much more poorly lit up. In fact so somber was the vault, that&#xD;
Charles with his feet struck against an object, which his eyeshade&#xD;
faled to discover.-&#xD;
&#xD;

DOLORES.&#xD;
"That sounds like wood, Dol" he said relinquishing her hand&#xD;
for a moment'in order to ascertain the nature of his discovery."&#xD;
"Indeed it is a box and a heavy onetoo" he continued in an&#xD;
excited manner. "Dol this is an adventure. If this box should&#xD;
contain gold !"&#xD;
"Give me your hand Charlie and let us go" Dolores said with a&#xD;
tone of urging supplication. You know I am no coward; but&#xD;
here my heart is failing me. I feel as if some evil thing will hap-&#xD;
pen us."&#xD;
"Very well, Dol" he answered soothingly "I'll not press the&#xD;
matter now.' The discovery may suffice for to-day and its devel-&#xD;
opment be left to another time. Come let us return."&#xD;
Suiting the action to his words he entered the passage with&#xD;
Dolores, when, all at once the sounds of oars striking the water,&#xD;
mixed with guarded voices of men, fell upon their ears. They&#xD;
stopped and Charles felt the hand of Dolores tightening around&#xD;
his own.&#xD;
"I knew it" she said " th a whisper "I knew that something&#xD;
would befall us. If you had only minded my warning."&#xD;
"Your warning would have been too late child. But I don't&#xD;
believe in danger yet. We shall most likely meet another com-&#xD;
pany of visitor; though I didn't think, that the cemetery was so&#xD;
much frequented. But hush, the're coming."&#xD;
Remaining in the fissure they now heard the noise getting&#xD;
more distinct every moment and at last saw a large boat with&#xD;
some'eight or ten men gliding into the first vault. There were&#xD;
several boxes in the boat; but Charles had not much time, to ex-&#xD;
amine them, for no sooner had the new comers seen the boat on&#xD;
the sand, when all of them uttered loud exclamations of surprise&#xD;
mixed with copious curses,&#xD;
"H-1 and damnation !" cried one of them, who seemed to be&#xD;
their leader, at the same time springing on the .sandy bottom&#xD;
"what does this signify ? An intruder in our cave? Where is he&#xD;
that I may send him to the fishes of the sea, for surely he'll not&#xD;
leave this place alive."&#xD;
His companions followed him, making boisterous demonstra-&#xD;
tions of their indignation and swearing numerous oaths reiterat-&#xD;
the declaration of their leader, to at once dispatch the intruder&#xD;
or intruders.&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
This was a trying moment for our young friends and if they&#xD;
had yielded to their fear and thrown themselves with cries and&#xD;
lamentations at the feet of the men, who so fearfully threatened&#xD;
their lives, we would have no reason, to be at all surprised. Still&#xD;
then did not and those expecting great things from Charles Fuchs'&#xD;
unusual qualities, would not have been disappointed, if they could&#xD;
have witnessed his conduct.&#xD;
"Back into the cave" he whispered to the girl "you are not&#xD;
safe here; I'll guard the entrance."&#xD;
Urging her back with his hand, he expected to have her follow&#xD;
his injunctions, although he had no time to convince himself, for&#xD;
the strangers finding the first cave empty were already hastening&#xD;
towards the second. Charles had not a moment to lose. Caus-&#xD;
ing the muzzle of his gun to become visible to the eyes of the ap-&#xD;
proaching party he cried with a loud voice:&#xD;
"Back!"&#xD;
The sound, breaking against the rocky walls, filled the grotto,&#xD;
with an uproar, truly startling. It accomplished its object how-&#xD;
,ever, for the men came to a dead stop, probably more affected by&#xD;
.surprise than fear.&#xD;
"Who ventures to impede our progress?" the leader inquired,&#xD;
while the others preserved an expectant silence.&#xD;
"One, who has the power, to enforce his dictates. One more&#xD;
step and I shall order my companions to fire."&#xD;
"But who are you? and what are you doing in there?"&#xD;
"As to the first question, I must refuse to gratify yqur curios-&#xD;
ity. As to the second you may know, that we came biy chance."&#xD;
"Then you knew nothing of the cave?"&#xD;
"Nothing but the idle rumor in the moutlhof the people."&#xD;
"But we cannot allow you to return. If you do not surrender&#xD;
all at once, we shall attack you and shoot you down like dogs."&#xD;
"It takes two to make a bargain. I We shall defend our lives as&#xD;
well as we can."'&#xD;
The intrepid tone in which this was said, did not fail, to im-&#xD;
press the men. The passage wasnarrow and only to be affected&#xD;
in single file. They did not know, how large the party in the&#xD;
second cave might be and taking all the things into consideration&#xD;
the attack, which the leader had threatened was a pretty risky af-&#xD;
fair. Putting their heads together the men seemed to deliberate&#xD;

&#xD;
on the best course 'to pursue; but before they had come to a con-&#xD;
clusion, the voice from the passage attracted their attention.&#xD;
"We dont know, who you are" it said "nor do we care to learn&#xD;
it. We are not interested in this cave and were brought here by&#xD;
the merest chance. Now under these circumstances, I should&#xD;
" think we could come to an understanding, which would on the&#xD;
one hand your secret and on the other our retreat.."&#xD;
"How would you secure our secret" the leader of the strangers&#xD;
replied.&#xD;
"By swearing to respect it."&#xD;
"What security would you give us for keeping your oath'?&#xD;
"That could hardly satisfy us."&#xD;
"Well to get away from here, we would have to confide in your&#xD;
oath; why shouldn't you trust us o s much?"&#xD;
"That is, you mean that we should swear, to let you go, in case&#xD;
you could satisfy us, as to your discretion?"&#xD;
"Exactly. Under no other circumstances could we consent, to-&#xD;
surrender ourselves to your mercy."&#xD;
"Well; I think, we must decline that offer. It will be much eas-&#xD;
ier, to starve you out and thus compel your surrender without&#xD;
condition."&#xD;
"You forget some circumstances calculated to interfere with&#xD;
that arrangement."&#xD;
"And which ones, pray.'&#xD;
"Firstly you leave out of your calculation the fact, that while&#xD;
we are protected from your attacks, a guard of yours would be&#xD;
subject to our bullets."&#xD;
Ah indeed ! And the other circumstance "&#xD;
"Some of our party are on the ocean fishing. They know, that&#xD;
we intended to visit the cemetery and if we dont return at sunset,&#xD;
they will surely come here with a force, to trace u's."&#xD;
The other suffered an imprecation to slip through his lips.&#xD;
"You see, that to blocade us, instead of securing your secret&#xD;
would only endanger it the more" The voice from the passage&#xD;
proceeded.&#xD;
"Curse you and the whole of them" the speaker said savagely.&#xD;
"What business had you, to put your saucy face into a pie, that&#xD;
don't concern your"&#xD;
"We had no idea of meeting you or anybody here."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        89&#xD;
Again the men put their heads together for a consultation..&#xD;
After a few minutes they seemed to have come to a resolution,,&#xD;
for the leader turning towards the fissure said :&#xD;
"My friends have authorized me to accept your proposition.&#xD;
So you may come out and give your pledge."&#xD;
"Not unless you swear, to let us go unobstructed." Raise your&#xD;
hand and speak, as I speak.&#xD;
The men did his bidding and faithfuily repeated the oath by&#xD;
which they bound themselves not to do any injury to such party&#xD;
or parties occupying at that moment the inner cave. This being&#xD;
done, Charles boldly stepped into their presence leading by the&#xD;
hand his trembling companion. The men looked blank. Was&#xD;
this the formidable party, that had threatened their destruction&#xD;
in case of an attack? They had been sold by a boy, but while&#xD;
they felt mortified at this humilation, they could not help admi-&#xD;
ring the fortitude and cunning, with which one so young had&#xD;
averted a fearful destiny.&#xD;
"Is that the whole party?" the leader inquired in a tone holding&#xD;
the middle between a scowl and a laugh.&#xD;
"The whole party in the cave, yes Sir."&#xD;
"And you are not afraid, that we will punish you for your de-&#xD;
ception?"&#xD;
"You forget your oath, sir. Besides, I do not recollect of&#xD;
having deceived you."&#xD;
"You spoke of an outside party ."&#xD;
"I spoke the truth. If we are here detained, there will be&#xD;
many persons out this very evening, to search for us, and it&#xD;
would certainly be strange, if they should miss the cave."&#xD;
"You may be right sir; but even if we could trust you on your&#xD;
oath, this little girl will surely tell on us."&#xD;
"No, I will not sir" Dolores answered, conquering her fear and&#xD;
stepping forward. You can trust me as safely as Charlie. In-&#xD;
deed I am no tattle tale."&#xD;
"I'll answer for Dolores" Charles now remarked.&#xD;
"She is no common child and what she says, she will faithfully&#xD;
adhere to."&#xD;
"She looks like it" the man resumed. "At any rate we have to&#xD;
run the risk. What is her name Sir?"&#xD;
"Dolores di Gatana."&#xD;

90                      DOLORES.&#xD;
"That is an outlandish name. Where does she reside?"&#xD;
"At the mansion in the village, with Mr. Fox."&#xD;
The man cast a significant look at his comrades. -&#xD;
"And your name" he inquired.&#xD;
"Charles Fuchs, of the same place."&#xD;
"Very well Charles Fuchs, I shall note these names and if ever&#xD;
we learn that you have violated your pledge, you will learn at&#xD;
your cost, that we can not safely be trifled with. And now you&#xD;
both solemnly swear, that for two years you will neither return&#xD;
to this place nor tell any human soul about its existence."&#xD;
"We do" the pair responded.&#xD;
"Well, in that case you may go. I trust that a lad, who has&#xD;
shown such selfcontrol and sagacity beyond his years, will show&#xD;
himself as trust worthy, as he. was prudent."&#xD;
"You may rely upon it" Charles replied and then helping Dol-&#xD;
ores into the boat and taking a seat in it himself, propelled the&#xD;
vessel from a place, which had verynearly become fatal to them.&#xD;
They remained silent for a few minutes; but Charles had too&#xD;
buoyant a spirit, to remain dejected long; so he roused himself&#xD;
saying:&#xD;
"Well Dol, that was a real adventure wasn't it?"&#xD;
"I dont like adventures, Charlie" Dolores said with a shake&#xD;
of her head, her natural cheerfulness still battling with the de-&#xD;
pression her nerves had experienced in consequence of the late&#xD;
exciting ordeal. "They are much nicer to read about, than to&#xD;
go through. Please, do row fast, so as to get away from these&#xD;
savage men. They must be pirates surely."&#xD;
"Hardly, Dol, or we should have heard of depredations on the&#xD;
coast."&#xD;
"Why then should they hide in caves and fear to be discovered?"&#xD;
"They may have many reasons, for what I know. They may&#xD;
be smugglers for instance."&#xD;
"Is smuggling so dangerous."&#xD;
"It is punished with fines and imprisonment; but Dol, what is&#xD;
this? We. have lost our way; this is not the channel in which&#xD;
we came, it is much wider."&#xD;
"So it is Charlie and there is the cave again. Oh! quick ! let&#xD;
us get away from the ugly place."&#xD;
Charles in his excitement--for we imagine that even his pulse&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        91&#xD;
had beaten with increased rapidity--had evidently missed the&#xD;
right direction and describing a curve, had returned to the basin&#xD;
before the cave. Fearing to fare worse in a second contact with&#xD;
the party in tbe cave, he rowed away as fast as he could choosing&#xD;
the wide channel, on account of the greater chance for speed it&#xD;
offered. But he had hardly gone over a space of a few hundred&#xD;
yards, when an exclamation of Dolores caused him to cease row-&#xD;
ing and to turn around. There at a distance of not more than a&#xD;
hundred feet lay a small brig, barely visible through the fissures&#xD;
and interval of the rocks, which at that place were less densely&#xD;
planted. A boat like that which the two had seen in the cave,&#xD;
was lying at the side-of the vessel and a party of men were bus-&#xD;
ily engaged in loading it with boxes by means ofa pulley, which&#xD;
was fastened to the end of the main sail-yard. Fortunately the&#xD;
men were too busy with their work to notice the pair in the boat&#xD;
and Charles soon succeeded in gaining a point, where they were&#xD;
secure against discovery.&#xD;
"The plot thickens Dol" the lad said with a l)zzled counten-&#xD;
ance but I'feel pretty sure now, that my guess was not much&#xD;
amiss."&#xD;
"What guess, Charlie?"&#xD;
"That the men in the cave are smugglers."&#xD;
"But what should they smuggle at this point ?"&#xD;
"That's what puzzles me. If they only hadn't secured our si-&#xD;
lence by making us swear, I'd soon smoke them out and know all&#xD;
about it."&#xD;
Another exclamation of the girl caused another stoppage of&#xD;
the lad's labor. Turning around lie saw, before him an avenue&#xD;
of considerable width at the end of which was the sea. This av-&#xD;
enue however was not open, but closed by a large number of&#xD;
rocks, which stood there even more densely than-at most other&#xD;
places, just as if nature had intended to hide this easy access to&#xD;
the harbor, where the brig was riding at anchor. The outlet was.&#xD;
on the left hand side, hardly visible from the ocean, because&#xD;
guarded by various gropes of rocky pillars, which concealed the&#xD;
entrance without impeding it. Through the intervals of the clos-&#xD;
ing palisades they saw the rocky island and oh. it the figure of&#xD;
Henry, who was evidently deeply engrossed with this sport.&#xD;
When they first discoerd him, he was just engaged in hauling&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7070-00000047"/>&#xD;
92 ,DOLORES.&#xD;
up a fish and Dolores requested her companion to take her out&#xD;
at once, because she wanted to see the sport. Turning the corner,&#xD;
tha boat soon swam on the open sea, loudly welcomed by the boy&#xD;
on the rock, who in spite of his entertaining passtime, was evi-&#xD;
dently giad, to see the adventurers safely return from a place so&#xD;
badly reputed in the village. Seeing his brother without any&#xD;
booty he laughed and said triumphantly:&#xD;
"Where are the eagles Charles? Wouldn't the ghos, allow you&#xD;
to take them away'? May be I chose the better part this time;&#xD;
for look at the fish, I caught in the mean time. Did you ever see&#xD;
more splendid fellows?"&#xD;
Charles, and Dolores could not help admiring the really fine&#xD;
fish, which Henry displayed, by raising from the water a line, to&#xD;
which they had been fastened in order to prevent their exposure&#xD;
to the sun. A desire of imitation seizing them, they both went&#xD;
on the rock and threw their tackles in the water; but without&#xD;
much success, to the delight of Henry, who continued to be as&#xD;
lucky, or-as he pretented-skillful, as ever. Half an hour after&#xD;
the return of the others he declared his intention to stop, as he&#xD;
would find difficulty in taking to the house, the fish he had caught&#xD;
already. The others acquiesced and it really seemed, as if the&#xD;
desire of changing the current of their thoughts, more than the&#xD;
pleasure of the sport had induced them, to make an attempt at&#xD;
fishing. The trio went into the boat and rowing in silence to the&#xD;
place of landing, deserted the vessel in a much more sober mood.&#xD;
than that in which they had entered it.&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
FLUcTUATIOxs.&#xD;
If anything had been wanting to complete the intimacy of&#xD;
Charles and Dolores, it was the common secret, which 'they were&#xD;
now compelled to harbor in their hearts. Being prevented from&#xD;
confmunicating their discoveries and adventures to others they&#xD;
could not refrain from making them the topic of frequent con-&#xD;
versations. Their friendship moreover became so fast and ardent&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                         93&#xD;
from the fact, that they had both of them no other channels for&#xD;
their flow of feeling. As we have said before Charles was of a&#xD;
reserved and somewhat lauglity disposition and even his brother&#xD;
Henry did not escape the condescending nonchalance with which&#xD;
he treated both boys and girls of his acquaintance. He was cons-&#xD;
cious of his mental and physical superiority and this is no wond-&#xD;
er, for not only in school had he long ago outdistanced all com-&#xD;
petitors for distinction, but also on many hard fought battle-field&#xD;
proved his superior strength and prowess. Experiencing no op-&#xD;
position in anything he did or said, he had unconsciously acqui-&#xD;
red the vice, resulting from unrestrained sway, i. e. willfulness&#xD;
and imperiousness. Even his parents yielded to his influence&#xD;
and it was well for the young man, that his intellect was so strong&#xD;
and his taste and disposition so pure, or the want of wholesome&#xD;
restraint might have proved even more injurious, than it really&#xD;
did. As it was he only had acquired the evil habits spoken of&#xD;
and the hatred of ever so many individuals of his age and sex,&#xD;
who had once been rivals and all of them sustained defeats more&#xD;
or less humilating. Like all persons of prominence -he did not&#xD;
escape either hatred or envy, though so far, he had found in the&#xD;
knowledge of this fact merely a source of proud exultation, a&#xD;
proof that as yet his enemies had not succeeded in touching any&#xD;
vital spot.&#xD;
His brother Henry was no exception from the rule. As long&#xD;
as he could think, Charles had always been an authority to him,&#xD;
too brave which was totally out of question. But ready obedi-&#xD;
ence engenders the relation of master and servant and this rela-&#xD;
tion excludes friendship. We have heard and read of ardent at-&#xD;
tachments between such parties but on close examination always&#xD;
found that they failed to stand the test of friendship. The slave&#xD;
may love his master with fidelity; but the dog does the same&#xD;
thing; and yet the animal crouching at his master's feet, is not&#xD;
his friend in the true sense of the word. The master may dote.&#xD;
upon- his servant with warm affection, he may love him sufficient-&#xD;
ly to expose his life for him: still pure friendship he cannot feel,&#xD;
because the principal and fundamental condition of friendship is&#xD;
equality.&#xD;
Henry did not love his brother, while the latter only enter-&#xD;
tained a feeling of kind toleration for the former. Yet Henry&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7070-00000048"/>&#xD;
94                       DOLORES.&#xD;
wash h            brother's inferior in intellect, as in character.&#xD;
not so mucprehended things as fast; but his thirst of knowledge, in-&#xD;
stead of being the steady even flame, that seeks to light up the&#xD;
dark recesses of nature, resembled more the fitful, wayward streak&#xD;
of lightning, more consuming and destroying, than ennobling and&#xD;
enlightening. Between such flashes long periods of total darkness&#xD;
were the rule for him and instead of being the joy of his parent;&#xD;
teachers he had proved to them a source of sorrow and vexation&#xD;
in proportion to his growing age.&#xD;
They had constantly drawn a parallel between him and his&#xD;
brother extolling the latter at his expense and this though per-&#xD;
haps just enough, ad in no small degree influenced his feelings&#xD;
towards Charles. Now,he latter's new attachment to Dolores&#xD;
had made matters ev  worse; for the spare moments of the&#xD;
eldea-bother, which had formerly in a measure been devoted to&#xD;
the younger one, were now much more pleasantly spent in Dolo-&#xD;
res' company. It is hard to say, how Henry would have liked&#xD;
the girl under different circumstances: as it was, the influence she-&#xD;
acquired over onegenerallyT so in accessable and the additional&#xD;
estrangement it causedbetween them-much as it was against her'&#xD;
wish and will-could hardly be productive of much sympathy&#xD;
between them.-&#xD;
For Charles however the acquisition of his new friend was very&#xD;
fortunate. What he had failed to meet with amongst all his com-&#xD;
rades-an equal spirit with which his own might struggle with-&#xD;
out the danger of too great a preeminency, lie now found unex-&#xD;
pectedly in this little girl. He had at first attempted to treat her.&#xD;
ike the others, but experienced a signal failure. Yet she had&#xD;
not rebuked him, not bandied words with him, or in the least.&#xD;
assumed the position of an antagonist;-no, there was a certain&#xD;
something in her quiet unobtrusive manner, which said more ef-&#xD;
fectually than any words could have done it:&#xD;
"Stop, sir, if you please; this will not answer in my case. Ify&#xD;
u and I are to be friends, it must be on a different footing."&#xD;
This language her manners had spoken with much benefit to&#xD;
him. He not only abstained from attempts, to domineer over&#xD;
her;, but showed  even more regard for the wishes and feelings ofo&#xD;
othrsndespcialyhi paets who tho' proud of their promnis.&#xD;
igsn cod espec is toalyblind to his faults, They noticed&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        95&#xD;
the change and ascribing it correctly to her influence, received&#xD;
the girl in their house and arms with parental fondness and vied&#xD;
with the parson and his sister, to make her happy.&#xD;
It is not to be wondered at, that under these genial circum-&#xD;
stances the happy germs in this gifted creature's nature develop-&#xD;
ped with.a truly astonishing rapidity. Her course of study might&#xD;
fitly be compared to the race of the noble steed, which out-dist-.&#xD;
ancing all competitors,. reaches the mark in an incredibly short&#xD;
time and thus gains the palm. But while some children skip aind&#xD;
hurry over the field of learning, to show a piece-meal erudition a&#xD;
superficial and fragmentory knowledge as the result, that of Dol-&#xD;
ores was the very reverse. To learn a thing and to remember it,&#xD;
was the same with her and Charles was more than once compel-&#xD;
led to have recourse to her memory in matters pertaining to the&#xD;
rudimental studies. Such applications however, instead of caus-&#xD;
ing jealousy, gave him much delight, as they were so many reas-&#xD;
ons in his eyes, why he should love and cherish this clever child..&#xD;
One day, he found an Italian quotation in one of his books and&#xD;
being ignorant of that language went to Dolores to have it trans-&#xD;
lated. It was the first Italian she had seen for a good while and&#xD;
r eye lit up with enthusiasm when she interpreted thequota-&#xD;
tion. She found a little difficlyficulty in doing it however and ex-&#xD;
pressed her fear to Charles, that she would soon forget her native&#xD;
tongue from want of practice. This remark resulted in the adopt-&#xD;
tion of a new study for the two, in which the general order was&#xD;
rersed Dolores appearing as teacher and Charles as her pupil.&#xD;
sWe know him to be an apt scholar; but 3 et his progress in Ital-&#xD;
ian, great as it was, was far from equalling the proficiency, which&#xD;
hedgirl soon acquired in German. Before a month of study had&#xD;
passed, the was able to understand the parents of Charles Fuchs&#xD;
and converse with them fluently on all ordinary topTics.,u&#xD;
Charles maintained, that even Dolores could not have accompli-&#xD;
shed this, if the language had not been, as it were, sleeping in her&#xD;
mind. She must have understood it in early childhood "he said"&#xD;
or all smartness in creation would not divest this phenomenon of&#xD;
its miraculous character.&#xD;
So the winter was one of earnest study and genial intercourse&#xD;
i the house, but it was also one of healty recreation and pleasant.&#xD;
passtime -without, No sooner had winter with icy hand bound-&#xD;

up the streams and pounds and spread a warm covering of snow&#xD;
over the sleeping herbs and flowers. when the young people ex-&#xD;
posed their persons to its icy breath, now gliding on skates over&#xD;
the glassy ice, now hitching Charles' own horse to a handsome&#xD;
sleigh and at the merry tickling of the bells, flying with the swift-&#xD;
ness of an arrow over the smooth course.&#xD;
At last christmas came, bringing Mr. Fox himself, instead of the&#xD;
box with presents, which Dolores had been led to expeet. Not&#xD;
that the box had been left behind-o no ! it also came along and&#xD;
much larger, than expected. Now Dolores was all lif and O&#xD;
and motion, not on account of the presents, not she! Th gir&#xD;
a grateful heart and amidst so much love and affection had not&#xD;
forgotten him, who had befriended her before all others and ex-&#xD;
tended to her a helping hand at the expense of his domestic peace.&#xD;
Dolores was not blind to his imperfections; but they did not in&#xD;
the least affect the love she bore him. Dolores thought so at inf&#xD;
rate, or rather felt so ; for as we have more than once. intimated,&#xD;
this little girl reasoned by perception and argued by intuition.&#xD;
When 'first he alighted from the carriage at the parsonage she&#xD;
flew into his embrace and for a long while would not release im.&#xD;
At last when she withdrew her arms, she commented on his&#xD;
apearance, telling him, that the sojourn in town did not at all&#xD;
agree with him. And she was right; for he had got much thin-&#xD;
ner and an additional wrinkle had laid itself across his forehead.&#xD;
At first, in the excitement of reunion this wrinkle did not amount&#xD;
to much and the merry emotions of his heart seemed not only to&#xD;
have the power to smooth that one, but all the others also. But&#xD;
when the first uproar had subsided and his features had glided&#xD;
back into every day's shape the wrinkle returned and deepened&#xD;
and obtruded itself upon the gazer, as if it meant to say : Here&#xD;
I am! here I mean to remain, I am a reality, I am a. chapter of&#xD;
this man's history, as you can learn, if you only have the key,&#xD;
that opens his lips.&#xD;
With Dolores the case was different ; her body had developed&#xD;
almost as rapidly as her mind and the glow on her cheeks intens-&#xD;
ified by the bracing winter air spoke of health and strength-.&#xD;
Three short months had hardly elapsed since his departure to the&#xD;
city and yet this girl had gained that roundness of form which&#xD;
only childhood can give so rapidly and which therefore is maine4&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
in the cold,--whoknow&amp;amp; how long-fondling his girl and askin&#xD;
and answering questions, if Miss Sarah had not finally&#xD;
and ihsinuated, that a continuation in the parlor would be ted&#xD;
able all around. So'they went in and the box was also b&#xD;
though under protesv too,    ,nc;th"  bx ws  lsobought,&#xD;
ug rpr since: it must. not bel opened before&#xD;
Christmas  eve. Then Dolores told. him, that Mrs. Fuchs was&#xD;
going to have a beautiful christmas tree and had invited her, to&#xD;
be her guest that night and then argued, that Mr. Fox must also&#xD;
go, or she couldn't at all think of it and yet liked to uo  so&#xD;
much. Mr. Fox promised her, to go along if she could secure&#xD;
him an invitation, a task which Dolores took upon herself with a&#xD;
.gravity truly becoming.&#xD;
Mr. Fox could not stay long. Besides the desire to see Dolor-&#xD;
'es, the condition of the factory had necessitated his presence. In&#xD;
commenting to the parson on the latter subject, the wrinkle on&#xD;
;is brow grew a little deeper, and it was evident that pecuniary&#xD;
troubles had been added to the domestic ones. Themanage-&#xD;
ment of Mr. Wood was without a "flaw" he said to the minister,&#xD;
and yet the income had been so much reduced, as hardly to meet&#xD;
the many expenses unavoidable in so large a household as his.&#xD;
ie wanted to see for himself, he said, though 'he knew before&#xD;
hand, that it would avail him nothing, since he could do no bet-&#xD;
ter or hardly so well as Mr. Wood, whose only fault was over-&#xD;
great fidelity to his employer-&#xD;
To this Mr. Goodman neither objected nor assented. Person-&#xD;
ally he did not like Mr. Wood; but he was far too honorable to&#xD;
allow his likes or dislikes to influence his words or actid u&#xD;
less they were seconded by outside reasons of weight  The la&#xD;
orers in the factory did not like Mr. Wood either; they had often&#xD;
intimated it to Mr. Goodman; but severity was not necessarily&#xD;
iniquity and Mr. Wood's fidelity to his employer might indeed be&#xD;
the cause of his exacting rigor. So Mr. Goodman remained si-&#xD;
lent on the subject and it was dropped without any fourth&#xD;
marks concerning it.&#xD;
The next morning John came from the mansion with the sleigh&#xD;
and drove Mr. Fox and Dolores to the factory  The d  g&#xD;
establishment were not closed against the cold, but the busy life&#xD;
within was the same, which Dolores had witnessed on th4 cca&#xD;
sion of her fist visit. Only one feature was ew; Charles and&#xD;

Henry occupying a workbench for themselves were now amongst&#xD;
the laborers, both working away with a good will, though with,.&#xD;
different results. On close examination one could see good pro-&#xD;
gress on the article in the hand of Charles. while Henry's work;&#xD;
showed the hands of the bungler. Old Mr. Fuchs was with the-&#xD;
bsowthe Foand olores were approacing their bench and&#xD;
boys, wm the look of vexation in the father's face and that of sullen-&#xD;
ness in Henry's it was evident, that a lecture had just been ended.&#xD;
When Mr. Fuchs however noticed the presence of his employer.&#xD;
the      p              fa    Smilin  officious and with a&#xD;
rapid dexterous grasp baring his head, he welcomed Mr. Fox and&#xD;
expressed his satisfaction of seeing him well.&#xD;
Mr. Fox took him aside.&#xD;
"Old friend" he said "a word in confidence,"&#xD;
"1How does the mill fare?"&#xD;
Fuchs played his old game in casting uneasy glances in every&#xD;
direction.&#xD;
"Pare? Mr. Fox, why she fares well ex1ough. As far as I know,&#xD;
she goes on as usual."&#xD;
"The same number of hands?"&#xD;
"The same number, Sir."&#xD;
"The same amount of work finished?"&#xD;
"To all appearances, yes Sir. Mr. Wood ought to be able, to&#xD;
answer that question."&#xD;
"But I want your statement. From the books I see, that you&#xD;
have changed a number of hands."&#xD;
"Mr. Wood's doings, Sir."&#xD;
"Were those dismissed, unfit?"&#xD;
"Not to my knowledge."&#xD;
"Are the new ones better?"&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs winced at the directness of these questions. Falter-&#xD;
ing between the wish to serve his employer and the fear of secur-&#xD;
ing the enmity of the superintendent, he answered :-&#xD;
"Why no! That is, they may, but I think....'&#xD;
"You also ship your goods to different customers, I perceive?"&#xD;
"So it seems from the marking on the boxes."&#xD;
"But what in the world can be the reason?"&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
"The new purchasers pay less and pay poorly."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
Mir. Fuchs repeated his gesture.&#xD;
"Can you tell me, why Stellman &amp;amp; Co. no longer buy from us?"&#xD;
"Well, it is.. .think it is, because we sent them.-at least&#xD;
I think so-a poor article."&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs seemed to be astonished at his own audacity, for&#xD;
he drew a deep breath after finishing his remark.&#xD;
"A poor article? Why in the world did you send them a poor-&#xD;
er article than formerly ?"&#xD;
"Not my doing, Sir. Mr. Wood you know....."&#xD;
"Ahyes, I forget. Well never mind Mr. Fuchs, I'll go to see&#xD;
him. Only I wish you would keep your eyes open as much as&#xD;
possible, and report to me, if you see anything wrong. Will you&#xD;
do that, Mr. Fuchs?"&#xD;
"Of course, I will, sir and with much pleasure" said the fore-&#xD;
man lifting his cap again and leading Mr. Fox to the door, where&#xD;
Dolores joined him, after having talked to Charles in'the mean&#xD;
time. At the door Mr. Fox turned back.&#xD;
"Charles my lad, can you come here a moment.?"&#xD;
When the lad was at his side, he continued :&#xD;
"Charlie, I learn from Dolores that she has an invitation from&#xD;
your mother for christmas eve.  Can you secure one for me&#xD;
too?"&#xD;
"Of course I can, Mr. Fox; but it is unnecessary; you know&#xD;
you are welcome without invitation."&#xD;
"May, be, my son, but I want one nevertheless and I want you&#xD;
to come and deliver it in person this evening at the parsonage.&#xD;
Do you understand Charlie?"&#xD;
"I think I do, Sir," Charles replied construing the other re-&#xD;
marks as a hint, that he wanted to speak to him privately "I'll&#xD;
"Very well, my boy, that will do."&#xD;
A few minutes afterwards Mr. Fox stepped into the office. Mr.&#xD;
Wood had received the news of his arrival but he feigned surprise.&#xD;
"Why, cousin Edward, this is unexpected" he said joyfully&#xD;
springing to hid feet and extending his hand to the new comer&#xD;
with'evident tokens of ph aure in his 'face. "What brings you i&#xD;
so rough a season into'the country ?"&#xD;
I   thought'  suspicion'had dwelled in the mind of Mr. Fox,&#xD;
ticorda reception was apt to chase it away in one so unsoph-&#xD;
&#xD;

isticated. He was even somewhat ashamed of it and hastened to&#xD;
reply.-                                          That is&#xD;
"Why Richard, I came to see this little girl of mine. Tht&#xD;
my principal errand and as a secondary matter, I thought I might&#xD;
consult with you about the factory and see whether we couldn't&#xD;
possibly make the concern a little more remunerative. Your re-&#xD;
mittences have dwindled down to such pitances, that I have been&#xD;
forced to considerably overdraw my deposits in the bank."&#xD;
If Mr. Fox had watched his foreman closely in making this&#xD;
statement, he might have seen a flash of malignant joy shooting&#xD;
from his eye; but it was not in the good natured character of that&#xD;
gentleman to watch other people's features for the purpose of&#xD;
reading their souls. So Mr. Wood found sufficient time in bring-&#xD;
ing his countenance into that doleful cast, which fitted the dis-&#xD;
agreeable revelations of the proprietor.&#xD;
"Why, I am glad you came" he said with a voice, whose capti-&#xD;
vating sweetness was still enhanced by a sympathetic touch.&#xD;
"I have been ill at ease, all this while and felt the weight of res-&#xD;
ponsibility as a crushing burden."&#xD;
"Oh well, you mustn't take the thing so much to heart" said&#xD;
Mr. Fox. Our embarrassment may be only temporary indeede I&#xD;
hope it will be and that spring may restore us to our old prosper&#xD;
ity."&#xD;
"And so lo I" Wood eagerly struck in. "I have done my very&#xD;
best to avert it and even proposed measures; that drew the odium&#xD;
of the hands upon me. Still if you think, that under a different&#xD;
management the business would revive, I am perfectly willing, to&#xD;
retire from my situation."&#xD;
Mr. Fox was startled at the thought of the bare possibility of&#xD;
such a step and the cunning manager knew it, or he would never&#xD;
have ventured such a proposition. He knew, that Mr, Fox loath-&#xD;
ed the idea of taking such a burden as the management of the&#xD;
factory upon himself and that he necessarily must dislike the&#xD;
idea, of changing superintendents at the time of a crisis. More-&#xD;
over the service of Mr. Wood had always been so faithful; lie&#xD;
had guarded the interest of his employer with such sacrifice of&#xD;
self, that even a more discriminating man thah.. Mr. Fox might&#xD;
well have hesitated to feel 'suspicious of one, who had so well&#xD;
stood the test of many years. So when the proprietor had once&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                      101&#xD;
more examined the books and found them kept with the old scru-&#xD;
pulous neatness and exactness, he drowned all the questions he&#xD;
had intended asking and after a consultation'of more than an&#xD;
hour left the factory in no ways wiser than he-Thad entered' it.&#xD;
During the day he was unusually still and *hen Charles arrived&#xD;
in the evening, he had not yet recovered the healthy tone, which&#xD;
generally characterized his manners. The youth formally. deli.-&#xD;
vered his mother's invitation, waiting for further developments&#xD;
at some suitable moment. - Mr. Fox however allowed several fa-&#xD;
vorable, opportunities of speaking to him to pass by, without&#xD;
benefitting by them and Charles thinking he might have forgot-&#xD;
ten his purpose, resolved to aid his memory. Waiting untilehe&#xD;
was alone with Mr. Fox and Dolores, whom he evidently did not&#xD;
consider in the light of an obstacle, he said:&#xD;
"Mr. Fox, when you begged me this morning to deliver my&#xD;
mother's invitation in person, you meant more than you said; at&#xD;
least I thought that you desired to speak to me in confidence.&#xD;
Was' I correct in that opinion?"&#xD;
Mr. Fox started from his pensive mood. He looked to the&#xD;
bright eye of the youth with pleasure and then said :&#xD;
"You were right, Charlie,.a new proof that you are a clever lad.&#xD;
However I have learned something since, that makes my commu-&#xD;
nication unnecessary, and I shall now forbear troubling you with&#xD;
my troubles."&#xD;
After these words, Dolores pushed her chair nearer to his and&#xD;
laying her hand upon his knee looked earnestly into his gloomy&#xD;
countenance,&#xD;
"Papa Fox, there is something the matter with you" she said&#xD;
"and I want to know it. It won't trouble me a bit and I am sure&#xD;
Charles neither for that matter."&#xD;
"No indeed, Sir, I'll be glad to do anything for your sake" the&#xD;
youth earnestly asserted.&#xD;
Mr. Fox was moved.&#xD;
,'Why, Children, it isn't so very much" he said "and I may as&#xD;
well tell you, if only to set your minds at ease about it."&#xD;
He stopped a moment and the absent look of his eye showed&#xD;
plainly, that his mind was wandering over the past. The- child-&#xD;
ren did not interrupt him, but with respectful consideration fixed&#xD;
their looks upon him, waiting for the moment when he would be&#xD;

102                    DOLORES.&#xD;
ready, to break his silence. At last he sighed deeply and turn-&#xD;
ing to the children, said :&#xD;
"Excuse me, children, if I keep you waiting; but what I have&#xD;
to say to you, embodies thoughts of distrust to those, I have been&#xD;
trusting many years, and it is but natural, that I should hesitate&#xD;
to plant into your young hearts, the seeds of feelings which em-&#xD;
bitters our mind and can not so easily be eradicated again. Still&#xD;
you desire to learn my troubles and I accept your sacrifice; for it&#xD;
is indeed pleasant to have confideuts though they be young and&#xD;
unexperienced."&#xD;
Again he stopped a minute. Then resuming he continued.&#xD;
"There are several things, that trouble me and if I once reveal&#xD;
them to you, I may as well make a clean breast of it. You know&#xD;
my relations to Mrs. Fox and I think that hardly requires an ex-&#xD;
planation."&#xD;
His companions nodded and Mr. Fox continued.&#xD;
"Lately the difficulty has extended to the children and that is&#xD;
one thing that worries me considerably. Lucy is total under&#xD;
the influence or her mother and if not removed from it, will soon&#xD;
be nothing but a senseless doll, an idle worshipper of fashion. It&#xD;
is hard to speak so of my own daughter; but it is oniy the sad&#xD;
truth. To make matters worse, I see no remedy."&#xD;
Charles seemed to think differently, to judge from the expres-&#xD;
sion of his face.&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Fox; it appears to me, as if you could easily stop&#xD;
those bad proceedings. Lucy surely is a good girl and if you&#xD;
pronounced a firm "veto" to Mrs. Fox fashionable affairs. . .-&#xD;
He stopped..&#xD;
"Charlie, you do not understand that, my lad. In forcing&#xD;
measures, as you advise, I would make life one continual torture,&#xD;
which I could not endure. Besides Lucy's development is an-&#xD;
noying me less, than that of Richard, who shows all the symptoms&#xD;
of a precocious depravity. He indulges in every fashionable vice&#xD;
and spends more money, than I am able to pay, even if I were in-&#xD;
clined to do so. He finds no difficulty in securing credit and thus&#xD;
far I have not come to the extreme of withdrawing my assistance,&#xD;
in paying his debts; but he must have other sources than my&#xD;
purse, for the bills that come to me for settlement can not pos-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       103&#xD;
rsibly contain all the items of his expenditures He must receive&#xD;
encouragement from without."&#xD;
"His mother?" Charles suggested.&#xD;
"Has not enough money, to defray her own expenses and con-&#xD;
tinually troubles me for contributions. No, he must have a friend&#xD;
interested in his ruin."&#xD;
"Or yours" Charles suggested.&#xD;
Mr. Fox started; with a troubled look he said:&#xD;
"The same idea! You meet me halfway. Charlie, what do you&#xD;
.mean?"&#xD;
"Nothing definite. Your remark suggested the idea."&#xD;
"But it has haunted me too, I do not know why; it caused my&#xD;
remark to you this morning and now, when I mean to confide it&#xD;
Ito you as a secret, I meet it on your lips."&#xD;
"I will not pass them' tho' to reach any other ears, Sir."&#xD;
"I know Charlie and therefore chose you as a confident in spite&#xD;
of your youth. Your father, tho' my good and faithful friend, is&#xD;
not cunning enough, to do me much good., You see I place great&#xD;
confidence in you, Charlie."&#xD;
"I appreciate your goodness."&#xD;
"Goodness, Charlie? No indeed my lad; it is anything but&#xD;
goodness, to draw your youthful mind into my troubles. Still I&#xD;
desire it, you expect it and so I suppose it has to be."&#xD;
Another short pause.&#xD;
-"Has your mother never touched this matter to you Charlie?"&#xD;
-"No, Sir, not to my recollections. She has her likes and dis-&#xD;
ilikes; but beyond that...."&#xD;
"Very well; so I shall have to give names after all.. The man,&#xD;
whom I have always considered my fast friend and only lately&#xD;
'been led to suspect, is....&#xD;
"A person, whom I know without your declaration" Charlie in-&#xD;
terrupted. "I must confess, that strange things have happened&#xD;
in the factory since my admittance, but I thought they might&#xD;
possibly'be explained in a natural manner and that it wasn't my&#xD;
'business 'to interfere."&#xD;
".But anew Charlie, if I entreat you earnestly; to make it your&#xD;
:business: will you promise me, to be watchful and this state of&#xD;
uncertainty, which destroys the little peace, of mind remaining&#xD;
ane and Threatens to reduce me to beggary at the amne time."~&#xD;

104                   DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
Charles started.&#xD;
"Is it as bad as that Mr. Fox?"&#xD;
"Fully as bad; but you haven't promised yet."&#xD;
"Well, then, I promise ; though my promise conditions a work&#xD;
of espionage, which I despise and wouldn't undertake for every-&#xD;
body. But I always liked you Mr. Fox and like you doubly since&#xD;
you acted so kindly to this little girl."&#xD;
"Why, this is strange! So you befriended me on her account?'&#xD;
It really seems as if my little foster-daughter were intented to in-&#xD;
demnify me for all the misery resulting from the treachery of re-&#xD;
lations."&#xD;
He stroked Dolores curls and then continued :&#xD;
"Mind Charlie, I want no guesses, no uncertainties. I quess&#xD;
already and that makes me wretched. Only, when the plainest.&#xD;
evidence establishes him guilt.... .then, and only then speak, the&#xD;
word, that is to decide his fate and mine."&#xD;
Charles promised and this ended the matter; for Mr. Fox de-&#xD;
clared that he had full confidence in the youth and would there-&#xD;
fore abstain from' any rules of conduct. This was of course-&#xD;
agreeable to Charles, who from that moment bent all the energy&#xD;
of Mrs mind upon the mission, that had been entrusted to him.&#xD;
Mr. Wood was very gay that evening. The interview with Mr.&#xD;
Fox had been so satisfactory and promising, that he thought, he&#xD;
might allow himself and his accomplice George an unusual in-&#xD;
dulgence. He had procured several bottles of wine and finished&#xD;
them off with many toasts to their success and the ruin of their&#xD;
employer .... &#xD;
If he had known, what terrible foe had been put on his track&#xD;
that very night, he might have felt very sober in spite of his ex-&#xD;
cessive drinking.&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
ON THE TRACK.&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs'es Christmas party had been a great success and.&#xD;
the box from the city its crowning feature. Everybody had been&#xD;
considered by the kind honor, who however had left on the morn-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        105&#xD;
ing following, thus depriving himself of the pleasure of seeing the&#xD;
faces, which his liberality had caused to brighten. In conse-&#xD;
quence of his departure the two families had sobered down and&#xD;
the young people-excepting Henry-resumed their habits of in.&#xD;
dustry. Every thing assumed its old-features or at least appear&#xD;
ed to do so; for in reality there were two secret currents running-&#xD;
under the surface, that seemed so tranquil. MIr. Wood and his&#xD;
accomplices carried on their nefarious plan, which was to result&#xD;
in thefinancial and social ruin of Mr. Fox; but while they were&#xD;
fooling themselves into a false security and by degrees grew&#xD;
kolder in their operations, a vigilant eye began to watch every&#xD;
motion of theirs, encouraged at first by grateful emotions for the&#xD;
man, whose ruin was being plotted; but by and by also by dis-&#xD;
coveries strange and startling.&#xD;
Charles conducted himself with the greatest caution. Not be-&#xD;
ing very fond of the occupants of the office nor indeed a favorite&#xD;
of theirs, he took good care, not to excite their suspicion by too&#xD;
rapid a change.in his demeanor towards them. He needed the&#xD;
priviledge of a free admission to the office and the books and to&#xD;
gain it, managed with a rare tact. Changing gradually from a&#xD;
cold conduct to polite advances first to George and afterwards to&#xD;
Mr. Wood; he soon exercised over them the charm innate to his&#xD;
person. Benefitting by the indulgence of Mr. Fox concerning&#xD;
his position in the factory, he examined the various departments&#xD;
with an eye, keen enough to penetrate the slightest details. The&#xD;
first thing that struck him as strange was the nature of the boxes,&#xD;
containing the steel used for the manafactures of the establish-&#xD;
ment. They were of two sorts, one very unlike the other, and&#xD;
yet marked as coming from the same firm. Even the handwriting&#xD;
was different, both sets evidently emanating from different in-&#xD;
dividuals, who preserved too distinctly their peculiarities, to be&#xD;
mistaken.&#xD;
Another suspicious circumstance was the difference of the metal&#xD;
packed in the different boxes, one being considerably superior to&#xD;
the other, as Charles knew from a test he made for the special&#xD;
purpose of ascertaining their quality. Yet there was no distinction&#xD;
made in the manufactory as to the material, as Charles could&#xD;
easily perceive on the better article premiscuously packed and&#xD;
sold with the inferior.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7070-00000054"/>&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
What could this signify ? Could it be barely possible that Mr.&#xD;
Wood was buying the inferior stuff without the knowledge of Mr.&#xD;
Fox? Charles resolved to ascertain this at the earliest moment&#xD;
after the latter gentleman's return to the country. In the mean&#xD;
time he worked himself into the good graces of the superintendent,&#xD;
by doing little turns for him and showing such aptness in making&#xD;
calculations, that Mr. Wood readily consented, when Charles&#xD;
manifested a desire to devote a portion of his time to the study&#xD;
of bookkeeping. The youth wrote a beautiful hand and executed&#xD;
the tasks, the manager set him, with such rapidity and skill, that&#xD;
Mr. Wood was at once surprised and pleased. Soon the student&#xD;
understood enough about the-management of the various books,.&#xD;
to examine their contents with a critical eye ; but he was no more&#xD;
successful than Mr. Fox. Whatever might be the character of&#xD;
other transactions of the superintendent, his books were evident-&#xD;
ly unexceptional. Nor did Charles wonder. It is so easy for a&#xD;
practiced eye to discover inaccuracies in books containing ac-&#xD;
counts; the figures show such merciless conclusions that a man&#xD;
.so cunning as Mr. Wood, would surely be very cautious not to be&#xD;
caught at such puerile blunders. If anything was wrong, it had&#xD;
to be looked for in another province and Charles resolvod to do&#xD;
so. He returned to his work bench and with reboubled energy&#xD;
renewed his observations on all the different branches of the est-&#xD;
ablishment.&#xD;
In this way the winter wore away, faster than Charles could&#xD;
recollect itto have gone over before. The reason was evident,&#xD;
besides the exciting watch on affairs in the establishment, he had&#xD;
his studies to attend to and above all his new friendship to en-&#xD;
gage him and absorb his thoughts. To please Dolores, he shun-&#xD;
ned no labor nor fatigue, and many a tiresome march through&#xD;
slush or snow did he make, for the purpose of either catching&#xD;
wild animals alive, .to give to her as pets, or killing others for the&#xD;
sake of their fur, of which he caused articles of dress to be&#xD;
manufactured for his friend. He spent nearly half his leisure&#xD;
hours at the parsonage and his mother would have become out-&#xD;
right jealous, if she had not herself loved the little girl with a&#xD;
mother's love and managed to secure a good portion of her free&#xD;
time for herself. Indeed Dolores spent so many hours at the&#xD;
house of Mrs. Fuchs, that it was hard to say, which was her real&#xD;
&#xD;
106&#xD;
&#xD;
OLURE.                       107&#xD;
home, the parsonage havin merely the advantage of the study&#xD;
hours and those of night. Even the latter Dolores often spent at&#xD;
the cottage of Charles' pa ents and the desire of enjoying the&#xD;
girls company drew the two families much more together and&#xD;
made them much more intimate, than they had formerly been.&#xD;
Miss Sarah all at once discovered new genial features in Mrs,&#xD;
Fuchs and the latter declared she daily saw new points in the&#xD;
spinster that deserved love and admiration. Dolores lived and&#xD;
breathed and hgl her being in love and tenderness and her nature&#xD;
developed in consequence with the rapidity and luxuriance of the&#xD;
tropics. Of the rank poison however peculiar to that zone, she&#xD;
was entirely free; and all the praise and care and affection be-&#xD;
stowed upon her, merely had the tendency of coloring more deep-&#xD;
ly the amiable traits of character.&#xD;
Besides the pleasure her studies gave her she delighted in noth-&#xD;
ing so much. as to brave the hardships of season and in Charles&#xD;
company roam over the snowcovered fields and forests of the&#xD;
neighborhood. She often accompanied him on his hunting ex-&#xD;
cursions and though of a very tender disposition and sensitive&#xD;
character could admire his skill as a marksman and look with&#xD;
childish delight on the conquered game, as it rapidly increased&#xD;
finally swelling to a burdensome load. She was totally free of&#xD;
that fashionable weakness, which cannot see a fly killed, though&#xD;
it does not hesitate to worry a servant a friend or relative to&#xD;
death. Indeed there was nothing sickly in the girl's nature her&#xD;
body being as healthy as her mind, receiving a tone and vigor&#xD;
by the judicious course of exercise to which she subjected herself&#xD;
that could not be surpassed.&#xD;
Dolores had been present at the interview between Mr. Fox and&#xD;
Charles and she now was the only confident, to whom he com-&#xD;
nunicated the progress of his operations. She was always kept&#xD;
"aufait" but still she was considerable startled, when late one&#xD;
evening he appeared at the parsonage, gun in hand and with a&#xD;
countenance all in a glow and excitement. Mr. Goodman was in&#xD;
his study and Miss Sarah in the dinning-room, setting the table&#xD;
for to-morrow's breakfast; so Charles found Dolores alone and&#xD;
could at once unload his heart of the burden, with which it was&#xD;
evidently oppressed.&#xD;

"Why Charlie so late at night! I did not expect you any more.&#xD;
Where do you come from? What is the matter?"-&#xD;
Charles set down beside her, with his gun between his knees.&#xD;
-'Dolores" he said with shining eyes "I have got them now."&#xD;
"Got whom, Charlie?"&#xD;
"Why the rascals, of course, on whose track I have been all&#xD;
this while."&#xD;
"Is it possible? You did discover something then, and papa&#xD;
was right?"&#xD;
"He was Dolores; but listen and I'll tell you all about it. You&#xD;
know, that I tracked the bear the other day and have been trying&#xD;
ever since to get the cubs for you?"&#xD;
"No, dear Charlie, I did not know that; for if I had, I should&#xD;
have begged you, not to expose yourself so much for my sake."&#xD;
"Expose myself! why, child. don't you think, I am a match for&#xD;
any bear? I have made more than one rue his audacity to make&#xD;
a stand against me. But that is not the point now, Dol; I simp-&#xD;
ly meant to explain to you, how I came to inake the great disco-&#xD;
very I 'spoke of., Last night I got everything ready for a hunt&#xD;
and before daybreak this morning I started on my way. I took&#xD;
the road to the bay ; because there the beat- had made her appear-&#xD;
ance. It had snowed a little during the night and when I reach-&#xD;
ed the shore, I saw the fresh tracks of horses and a sled."&#xD;
He stopped and looking at her with a expectant glance seemed&#xD;
to wait for a sign of surprise Yet it did not come.&#xD;
"Well Charlie, what else? That surely isn't the great discovery&#xD;
you spoke of'?,'&#xD;
Charles laughed.&#xD;
"Dol, you little goosy, it wasn't the discovery, but it led to it.&#xD;
What do you suppose I thought, when I saw the track?"&#xD;
"You wondered, who had made it."&#xD;
"No I didn't, for I knew that at once from a spoke, which had&#xD;
been left behind. It was painted red and black and belongs to&#xD;
the large sled of the factory."&#xD;
"Ah!" Dolores exclaimed. A light seemed to dawn to her.&#xD;
"So I didn't wonder, who had made the track, but rather, why&#xD;
they had made it; moreover, why they had made it during the&#xD;
night. You know there is some little ice along the shore and the&#xD;
track went to the very water's edge. In following it I saw in the&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        109&#xD;
snow the impression of a box, the shape of which struck me as&#xD;
familiar. I thought a moment and then was sure, that it had&#xD;
been made by one of the -boxes, in which we receive the metal at&#xD;
the factory."&#xD;
"Ah !"&#xD;
"You begin to see now, Dol don't you? Well a blind man&#xD;
might, for that matter" Charles rejoined jokingly. "Thinks I to&#xD;
myself: Charlie, what can this signify? A box from the factory&#xD;
and well filled too,-for the impression was deep and sharp-&#xD;
fetched from the seashore at the dead of the night! I was puz-&#xD;
zled, but only for a moment; for all at once a flash ran through&#xD;
my mind, lighting up my memory with a wonderful brightness. I&#xD;
had seen such boxes before, besides those at the factory: I had&#xD;
seen then on the boat in the cave !"&#xD;
These words were spoken with an impressive voice and to in-&#xD;
crease the effect, Charles had in saying them seized the arm of&#xD;
this companion. This had the desired effect. Greatly excited,&#xD;
she sprang to her feet, and clasping her hands together, cried in&#xD;
a hurried manner:&#xD;
"Oh the cave, the dreadful cave ! I shake even now, when I&#xD;
think of it. Charlie, are you not mistaken ?"&#xD;
"Not a bit of it and I'll fathom the whole thing. Didn't I tell&#xD;
you at the time that I thought those men were smugglers?"&#xD;
"Yes, you did and so you think ...."&#xD;
"That they are smuggling part of the steel, from which we&#xD;
manufacture our cutlery."&#xD;
"But why should they do it?"&#xD;
~Because they can import steel much cheaper than buy it here,&#xD;
provided they avoid the duty. I always wondered at the dif-&#xD;
ference in the boxes and the metal- now I understand it all."&#xD;
"And do you think, that, that my dear papa knows about it?"&#xD;
"No, I do not. Firstly Mr. Fox is too good a citizen, to desire&#xD;
to cheat the government of its dues and secondly, if he were a&#xD;
party to the fraud, he would surely not have. set a. spy upon his&#xD;
own actions,"&#xD;
"But who then, should have to ran so great a risk?"&#xD;
"Who else, but Mr. Wood? Of course, he isn't alone, for he&#xD;
needs accomplices in such a transaction. To make sure, I went&#xD;
to the stable and asked the driver divers questions, taking good&#xD;

care to make them perfectly innocent. In spite of my careless&#xD;
mien, the fellow got confused, contradicting himself several times,&#xD;
and finally getting vexed and rude. If a doubt had existed in my&#xD;
mind before, this man's conduct would at once have destroyed it."&#xD;
',I wonder, Mr. Wood should have acted so carelessly as to let&#xD;
the track in the snow betray his actions."&#xD;
"I do not Dolores. I saw, there was a consignment of metal&#xD;
from the depot too and he most likely thought, that he could&#xD;
conceal his smuggled boxes best by mixing them with the others.&#xD;
Besides. it snowed so heavily last evening, that it had the ap-&#xD;
pearance of continuing all night, in which case, the tracks would&#xD;
have beeen obliterated."&#xD;
"That is true, Charlie. The weather has favored us greatly;&#xD;
but what do you intend doing next? Will you communicate with&#xD;
papa at once?"&#xD;
Charles shook his head.&#xD;
"Mr. Fox wants positive proof and to give that, we must catch&#xD;
the evildoers in the act. This we cannot do."&#xD;
Why not Charlie? Will they not sooner or later repeat their&#xD;
action?"&#xD;
"They will undoubtedly ; but to prove smuggling we must show&#xD;
the connection with a foreign vessel or at least a vessel from a&#xD;
foreign port. Can we do this, Dol?"&#xD;
Dolores started.&#xD;
"Our oath !" she said with a tone of awe.&#xD;
"There lies the difficulty" Charles resumed. "We can hardly&#xD;
convince Mr. Fox, without violating our plighted oath, and yet&#xD;
we cannot perjure ourselves."&#xD;
"Of course not" Dolores earnestly assented.&#xD;
'Therefore, it will be better, if we say nothing of our discoveries&#xD;
at present; but continue to watch and do our best, to counteract&#xD;
any pernicious influence of the superintendent. I am sure now,&#xD;
he is cheating Mr. Fox out of his profits, for a man, who goes so&#xD;
far, will not hesitate, to dive to the bottom of iniquity."&#xD;
On this they finally resolved and after some further delibera'&#xD;
tion on the subject Charles withdrew.&#xD;
A start was made; a point gained and our young friend had no&#xD;
doubt, that he would now be able not only to discover Mr. Wood's&#xD;
otherNmachinationis, but also to foil his evil intentions and secure&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       111&#xD;
Mr. Fox from their pernicious consequences. If that fatal oath&#xD;
had not been, his task, would have been much more simple, but&#xD;
even as it was, he felt confident of final success.&#xD;
Before his discovery, the examination of the books had been&#xD;
fruitless,--now they promised rich results. Resuming hi "vst&#xD;
atuthe offie Charlesevthisfto        eiRumn his -visits&#xD;
Sales devoted himself to their perusal with renew-&#xD;
e zea and soon learned, how Mr. Wood had been able to&#xD;
1 h.oo                     en abe tocon-&#xD;
ceal his operations so long and successfully. According to the&#xD;
books Mr. Wood used nothing but American steel, charging the&#xD;
fatheraye wih the whole hadmaskedand crediting certain firms with&#xD;
fat  r   ihthe  w oe  a o n   n   rdtn     eti   im same.  If Mr. Fox  had 'asked for the receipts of those parties,&#xD;
the thing might have been very different;pts ohse  goodes&#xD;
naturehad always prevented such thorough measures,thesuper&#xD;
intendent found no difficulty in making the whole thing very&#xD;
plausible in the books, which moreover captivated the exam&#xD;
by their extreme neatness.&#xD;
Charles readily understood the motive of Mr. Woods smugg-&#xD;
ling operations; but why was the inferior metal thus smugg-&#xD;
worked -hus acquired&#xD;
worked p promiscuously with better material? This consider-&#xD;
ably puzzled our young friend, who was enoughofabsns&#xD;
man, to see, that by classing the goods according to their value,&#xD;
the superintendent. could have secured a better market and also&#xD;
more remunerative prices. His management could    a&#xD;
tendency of creating discontent amongst the purchasers and final-&#xD;
ly drive them to another market. What conld it mean? Wa&#xD;
barely possible, that Mr. Wood had not only the desire of enrich-&#xD;
ing himself, but also the more damnable one   of     em-&#xD;
ployer, after he had reached his own purpose? It must be so, for&#xD;
Charles could conceive no other motive, and holding fast this&#xD;
idea, until something better would present itself, lie concluded to.&#xD;
act upon it.&#xD;
By this time, spring had begun to send its, for-&#xD;

ne of showers and storms and glimpsesbof sunshine and the&#xD;
unerring cry. of birds of migration high above in the air. The&#xD;
'weather began to become more and more settled but even before&#xD;
the country was at all inviting, the family at the mansion to every-&#xD;
body's surprise, made its appearance. Mrs. Fox was the instiga-&#xD;
tor of this unexpected movement, which had been hertiga-&#xD;
dorsed by her husband, though he could not help wndeartily en-&#xD;

&#xD;
self at the change of his wife's notions. Formerly she had derid-&#xD;
ed the pleasures of the country and only consented to a residence&#xD;
in it, because her fashionable friends all indulged in it, and&#xD;
because the dullness of the city during the summer months was&#xD;
even more intolerable, than that of the country- She had always&#xD;
come as late and gone as early, as possible; but now it seemed&#xD;
as if the exception of the fall was to become the rule for the&#xD;
future. She declared herself to be delighted with the beauties of&#xD;
nature and Mr. Fox was glad enough to perceive the change ; for&#xD;
it was not the only change visible in his wife. Her conduct to&#xD;
Dolores who of course returned to the mansion on the arrival of&#xD;
the family, was all Mr. Fox could desire; for though she would&#xD;
not condescend to bestow any marks of affection or regard upon&#xD;
the girl, she abstained on the other hand from those manifesta-&#xD;
tions of disgust or enmity, which had made Dolores so miserable.&#xD;
As we have said, Mr. Fox was pleased with the change in his&#xD;
wife's conduct, without caring to know the source. If he had&#xD;
known it: would he have been as indifferent? Hardly, for the&#xD;
faithless woman had wronged her husbaad in a point, where men&#xD;
are very sensitive and ready to avenge their sullied honor even&#xD;
if not wounded in their heart. Easy and indluging, as Mr. Fox&#xD;
was, it is more than likely, that the guilt of his wife would have&#xD;
roused the lion in his nature and brought up a tempest fearfulin&#xD;
proportion to its rareness-&#xD;
And she, who has forgotten the vow of love and fidelity, which&#xD;
once she plighted to the man of her choice-how does she feel?&#xD;
How does she manage, to sooth and quiet the monitor, who per-&#xD;
sists in telling her, that she is emptying the cup of sinful lust-&#xD;
how does she feel ? She does not care to sift her feelings; for on&#xD;
the surface she finds a happiness, that suffices her. "'If anything&#xD;
redeems her lost condition and mitigates the severity of our&#xD;
judgement, it is the fact, that she really loves the man, who has&#xD;
accomplished her ruin. He has devoted a life to her, he has with&#xD;
tenacious perseverance pursued a plan, the only plan of his exist-&#xD;
ence, and on it has wasted all his strength and'energy and feel-&#xD;
ing. Sueh a love is tempting. What does it matter, if it is ac-&#xD;
complished with a fierce hatred to her husband and the burning&#xD;
wish to accomplish his ruin ? What is that husband to her? Her&#xD;
vivacity, her restlessness, her deep emotions and passionate feel-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
113&#xD;
&#xD;
ings are foreign to the ease and nonchalance of his character.&#xD;
He might have answered for a slave; but slave he would not be&#xD;
and else he 'could not. So when the tempter stepped up to her&#xD;
and with a sweet and insinuating voine spoke fiery words, which&#xD;
struck a kindred string and pleaded the cause of his mad passion&#xD;
with a fervor that was congenial to her ardent nature, she strug-&#xD;
gled but a moment, as we have seen and readily yielded to the&#xD;
glittering enticement.&#xD;
She had sinned and by adhering to her lover, continued to sin:&#xD;
but, i spite of it, her love, however wrong, threw those softening&#xD;
influences around her, which that passion always excercises over&#xD;
woman. She seemed to grow younger and more beautiful, though&#xD;
that beauty had even before been remarkable, as we have seen.&#xD;
The servants were like Dolores benefitted by their mistress'&#xD;
change. She was less, fretful, and more easily pleased. Lucy&#xD;
with her quiet ways and, peaceful mind was least affected by the&#xD;
change; but Richard instead of being benefitted, was actually in&#xD;
jured by his mother's increased indulgence. Aping the dandies&#xD;
of the city, which tolerated and flattered him for the sake of his&#xD;
money, he fell into all kinds of absurd extravagances, which&#xD;
secured to him the ridicule of the neighborhood and the dislike&#xD;
of the household, his mother forming the only exception.&#xD;
Towards Mr. Fox his wife showed a certain reserve, approach-&#xD;
ing shyness; but this diffidence so charming in a woman when&#xD;
the result of bashful coyness and timid modesty and the first&#xD;
dawning consciousness of conjugal love, had no attraction to the&#xD;
husband, when it was the result of the admonitions of a guilty&#xD;
conscience. Mr. Fox was glad enough to be left alone and nothing&#xD;
indeed was further from his mind, than the desire to resume&#xD;
more intimate relations to a wife, whom he had oice loved and&#xD;
cherished, but who, by her way-wardness and her caprices had&#xD;
long ago succeeded in stiffing the emotions, which had filled, his&#xD;
heart.&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
TWO YEARS LATER.&#xD;
Time flies fast; but the narrator can accelerate its motion. He&#xD;
need but raise his wand and months fly faster than seconds; sum-&#xD;
mer changes to winter and winter back to summer. He lets the&#xD;
infant be born and by a wink mature to maidenhood or adoles-&#xD;
cence; he plants the acorn and by his magic power causes the&#xD;
mighty tree, to shoot up in a moment and spread its branches&#xD;
amongst the clouds, to protect the warbling birds or the weary&#xD;
wanderer in its shadow.&#xD;
We call at the factory two years after the first visit of Dolores.&#xD;
We enter the office and see Mr. Wood in a perfect tempest of rage.&#xD;
He strides up and down with a vehemence, that knows no bounds&#xD;
and it is doubtful whether his words are uttered in soliloquy or&#xD;
addressed to George the only occupant of the room.Georgehich&#xD;
shrugs his shoulders repeatedly; but returns no answer, whic&#xD;
silence creates the doubt alluded to. But enough of reflections;&#xD;
drawing up the curtain for the second act, we retreat behind the&#xD;
scenes and let the persons of the drama speak for themselves.&#xD;
"Confound them all !" Mr. Wood exclaimed, showing a far&#xD;
greater sense of propriety in this amaible utterance, than in some&#xD;
of his previous expressions "confound them all, I-say! This is&#xD;
more than I can bear, either they or I! I must at once press&#xD;
matters to a decision."&#xD;
'"But by too great a haste you may spoil, what hasn't been&#xD;
spoiled yet" George now interposed.&#xD;
"Too great a haste! yes indeed! you have been even selling&#xD;
tardiness all the time and tardiness has spoiled everything."&#xD;
"But what is lost, Wood? I really think, that you see things&#xD;
in too gloomy a light."-h&#xD;
"What is lost?" the irritated man repeated with that snappish&#xD;
tenac'ty so peculiar to persons in his mood "ask me rather, what&#xD;
is no t  ? Have we made any headway these 18 months?&#xD;
"Not much, to be sure, but remaining stationary and to lose&#xD;
ground are two different things."&#xD;
"I think differently, There is nothing stationary in this world&#xD;
and not to progress is to slide back. Have we not been obliged&#xD;
to give up our new customers and fall back upon the old ones?"&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
"Why yes; but ..."&#xD;
"Have we not in that way lost all the gain accruing from oar&#xD;
clever operations?"&#xD;
"Of course; but then. .."&#xD;
Have we not been obliged, to smuggle a better quality of steel,&#xD;
in order to be at all able to continue that fete " qualisee,&#xD;
to the success of our plans?"&#xD;
"That is all very true; but we smuggle still in undisturbed&#xD;
security and the profit we derive from it, is not     "&#xD;
Wood stopped short, he shook his e   i  an angry    an&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"George you are like all the others,l g     o   e&#xD;
over the parts. You may be a good private, but you will never&#xD;
be ageneal.Do you think, I care foriae u  o  ee&#xD;
you think I accumlthk l  care for  or a few paltry pennies? Do&#xD;
ate lucre, for the sake of lucre? I thought&#xD;
you knew me better, and surely you ought; for I revealed myin.&#xD;
most thoughts to you so often. If I  ga;n r ievee   nc&#xD;
for which I worked and planned through maiary yeance&#xD;
don't care that much for all the treasures in the world,"&#xD;
Mr. Wood did not refer to that other and even stronger&#xD;
of his; indqed he had never made G ga eventofg passion&#xD;
"B George a confident of it..&#xD;
"But your chance for that is as good as ever, Richard  I&#xD;
nothing to spoil the game."&#xD;
"I do. Have you forgotten Charlie's visit to the cave?"&#xD;
"No, but he has faithfully kept his oath of secrecy.&#xD;
He need not keep it any longer; for Captain Butler  ou r&#xD;
member bound him only for two ears thinking&#xD;
be ngre likely to remain silent during that period than a ore&#xD;
lengthy and indefinite one. One more week and the n  a&#xD;
will be free to act.  "&#xD;
"But do you think, he will venture there again?"&#xD;
"He venture? Why George, you sometimes ask childish ques-&#xD;
tions. You surely know Charles Fuchs long&#xD;
vinced, that he is not the person to be easily scared."&#xD;
"Still he knows nothing of our contraband trade. He may pad&#xD;
a dozen visits at the cave and never meet our friends."&#xD;
"He may and may not. I -surely cannot run such risks. Be-&#xD;
sides I am not so sure about his ignorance concerning the secrete&#xD;
of the cave,"g                     cecnennthscrs&#xD;

"I know, I am. This continual suspense and excitement is tel-&#xD;

"But whatkmakes you so afraid of aCharlie?"&#xD;
'I .hardly know myself. I like the boy and yet I fear him; at&#xD;

"Well, go to see Peter this evening and warn him into double&#xD;
vigilance. Let him report the arrival of the vessel without -a&#xD;
moment's delay."&#xD;
"I will, Sir."&#xD;
"Very well. Now listen carefully. Captain Butler is not aware&#xD;
of my intentions. He thinks that Mr. Fox has knowledge of our&#xD;
clandestine connections. Thus far neither party has received&#xD;
any writings from the other concerning-.these transactions;' but&#xD;
this time I shall demand a receipt from Butler's hand, for the&#xD;
payment of the cargo of steel, he will deliver."&#xD;
"But will he give it?"&#xD;
"I think so. I shall pretend, that my employer suspects fraud&#xD;
and that I want him to see the receipt for the whole sum."&#xD;
"But what good will such receipt do you?"&#xD;
"Why, George, don't you think, it will make the commander&#xD;
of the revenue cutter start, when he la3 s his eyes on it?"&#xD;
"But the cutter lies at P., a goodway off."&#xD;
"P. is not out of the world and a quick messenger can take it&#xD;
there in 12 hours. That part of the enterprise I thought of puii-&#xD;
ting into your hands."&#xD;
"Into mine?" the other asked with a look of surprise. "1&#xD;
hardly know, whether I should fancy the idea of being so far&#xD;
from the scene of action."&#xD;
Wood looked at him with a keen searching lance.--&#xD;
"Why don'tyou say at once, that you don't trust me and that&#xD;
you expect to be cheated out of your portion of the earnings'7"&#xD;
"It isn't that" George replied slightly embarrassed "but yon&#xD;
would not be here on my return and where should I find youth"&#xD;
t isn't necessary that you should find me George" Wdod&#xD;
coldly responded. "Dont misunderstand me; you shall faith&#xD;
fully receive the liberal reward, your assistance merits and that&#xD;
too before you start; but as to furthe.j fellowship, it is neither&#xD;
desirable nor wise. I like you well enough, George, but I cannot&#xD;
say that I like the idea of having a living, speaking monitor&#xD;
about me, to remind me of a transaction, which it is our interest&#xD;
to bury in oblivion. If you reflect a little. my lad, you must con-&#xD;
fess, that separation is our best policy."              -&#xD;

there was another reason in the heart of his accomplice for wish-&#xD;
ing a separation and this want of sincerity, considerably annoyed&#xD;
him. A certain dark thought again arose in the depth of his&#xD;
soul and while he deliberated with the superintendent on the ruin&#xD;
of his principal, he calculated, whether by the betrayal of the&#xD;
former he could not induce the latter to double his gains. To&#xD;
obtain this end, however he must of course acquiesce in the others&#xD;
arrangements without further contradiction: so smoothing his&#xD;
countenance into an approving smile he said :&#xD;
"May be you are right, Richard; indeed now I think of it, you&#xD;
are right, though at first I didn't fancy the idea, to be thrown&#xD;
away like a squeezed lemon."&#xD;
Wood laughed.&#xD;
"What an absurd smile! If you had compared yourself into a&#xD;
swollen sponge, you would have been more correct."&#xD;
"But what other measures do you propose Richard?"&#xD;
"That is soon told. I am going to give Butler a forged check on&#xD;
the Phoenix Bank of P. and divide with you the profit of the&#xD;
"coup." It isn't more than fair, that the Captain should at last&#xD;
pay the penalty for the violation of our laws: don't yon think&#xD;
so?"&#xD;
.The two worthies laughed at this joke. It is so easy to laugh&#xD;
at the expense of others.&#xD;
"He cannot suspect the trick," Wood continued "and to make&#xD;
the joke more capital, he can have no recourse on account of&#xD;
forgery."&#xD;
"Hardly!" 'George struck in "I wager, that he'll keep very&#xD;
ipm about it,"&#xD;
"Mum? no George, he'll swear at us,until his bile is all exhaus-&#xD;
ted and the devil tired of his invocations."&#xD;
' Xo doubt of that, but go on. I am decidedly curious, to see&#xD;
ypur fine tactics developed."&#xD;
, am nearly done. I expect considerable remittances shortly&#xD;

"Why yes, of course" the young man replied, being unable to&#xD;
suppress a slight blush, that persisted in mantling his cheeks.&#xD;
He was determined, to set that proverb at naught and at the&#xD;
same time entertained serious doubts regarding the truthfulness&#xD;
of the other's statements. But then he didn't care, if Wood ap-&#xD;
propriated that money, as he was at the very moment revolving&#xD;
plans in his mind, whose results would more than compensate&#xD;
him for any loss, he might experience at the hands of his-accom-&#xD;
plice. He aimed at nothing less than the destruction of his com-&#xD;
rade and that too with an indifference truly diabolical. Of the&#xD;
two rogues he evidently was the blackest; for while the super-&#xD;
intendent aimed at the gratification of the powerful passions of&#xD;
love and hatred, his younger accomplice merely worked for the&#xD;
satisfaction of the meanest of all earthly vices-miserly greedi-&#xD;
ness and heartless avarice.&#xD;
"And we must really part?" he added with a hypocritical sad-&#xD;
ness. "I shall feel lost, for hitherto I have faithfully looked to&#xD;
you for guidance."&#xD;
"I presume you will find better guides and safer ones" Wood&#xD;
said with ironical sincerity. "Comfort yourself oin that score.&#xD;
And now be off George and notify Peter; so that wee will at once&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
AN ARRIVAL.&#xD;
On the afternoon of the same day a stranger walked the road&#xD;
leading to the village. He had a foreign air and a foreign look-&#xD;
ing carpet-bag and we need therefore not wonder, that he stopped&#xD;
every few minutes to subject the different houses to a scrutiniz-&#xD;
ing glance. The appearance of the stranger was not very prepos-&#xD;
sessing.  His suit was rather shabby, but this circumstance;&#xD;
which we are apt to overlook when connected with a pleasant&#xD;
countenance and a genial look, was in his instance aggravated by&#xD;
a very uninviting face. Not that the features had been ugly-&#xD;
no, their expression rather than their form repelled those, who, in&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7070-00000061"/>&#xD;
120                    DOLORES-&#xD;
passing the man, looked at him with natural curiosity. One or&#xD;
two overcoming their dislike and judging him to be a stranger&#xD;
from the indecision of his movements, stopped and kindly asked&#xD;
him, what he wanted and whether he was trying to find somebody.&#xD;
To this they got no satisfactory reply however. The stranger,&#xD;
after a few words of answer, muttered so indistinctly, as to make&#xD;
it uncertain whether they were english or not, rudely turned from&#xD;
the would-be-guide and resuming his indecisive motions, con-&#xD;
tinued his walk towards the village.&#xD;
Now, when he passed Mr. Fuchs' cottage, it happened, that the&#xD;
mistress of the house occupied her wonted seat on the porch of&#xD;
the building. She happened to call with a loud voice to one of&#xD;
her sons, who was evidently near, though not in sight and her&#xD;
words, spoken in german at once attracted the attention of the&#xD;
stranger. His face lost a portion of that eager spirit peculiar to&#xD;
horses, when after a long fatiguing trip, they approach the crib&#xD;
and smell the oats. Approaching the gate that led into the garden,&#xD;
he called the attention of the woman to his person by saying in a&#xD;
voice, which was sharp and snappish:'&#xD;
"Sie sind deutsch, Madame, nicht wahr?"&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs looked at him attentively.&#xD;
"Jawohl, mein Herr, warum?"&#xD;
"Warum ?" the stranger said snappishly, continuing of course&#xD;
in German, which for the benefit of the reader, I shall however&#xD;
translate into good English "why? That is self evident, I am a&#xD;
german, seek a german, and wish to find him, for I am tired,&#xD;
hungry and thirsty."&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs looked at him with a mien, showing plainly, that&#xD;
she did by no means appreciate the fellow's plainness and short-&#xD;
ness. Still there is something gratifying in meeting a -country-&#xD;
man even tho' he be a boor and she replied more kindly than his&#xD;
manners warranted:. &#xD;
"Ursache genug ! Reason enough, to be sure. It is but Chris-&#xD;
tian duty to assist in ending so much distress. Will you not&#xD;
come in and eat and drink and rest and then continue your search,&#xD;
in which I shall of course assist you, if I am able"&#xD;
The lady's kindness still more reduced the stranger's sourness.&#xD;
He signified his readiness to accept the invitation and passing&#xD;
through the gate, assumed a comfortable position on the porch&#xD;
&#xD;
DOAT FLORQ&#xD;
&#xD;
-AJJ 5  c.                    121&#xD;
with a readiness and n ichalance, that showed at once the great&#xD;
care, this individual took of No One; i. e.,himself.&#xD;
"So Madam" he said, depositing his long and slender carpet-&#xD;
bag. "I am seated, Gott sei Dank and if you will procure some&#xD;
eatables, I shall not fail to do them justice. I have had nothing&#xD;
since this morning and to tell the truth, my breakfast was merely&#xD;
the shadow of a one."&#xD;
Good-natured Mrs. Fuchs forgot over the fellow's hunger the&#xD;
cynic way, in which he informed her; or perhaps she excused&#xD;
him on account of the circumstances in which she found him.&#xD;
She probably knew, that the rough contact of the world is not ex-&#xD;
actly calculated to make us either smooth of mouth or tender of&#xD;
touch and that like the butterfly we lose the delicate bloom on&#xD;
our wings when an uncouth hand intercepts our merry flight&#xD;
amongst flowers and their perfumes.&#xD;
"Wait a moment" she said and disappearing in the house soon&#xD;
returned with some of the substantial blessings of life. The&#xD;
bread and butter and cheese were accompanied by a glass or two&#xD;
of wine, though not of that prime article, which Mr. Fox .had&#xD;
tasted on the visit we witnessed. No indeed! Mrs. Fuchs knew&#xD;
better. She believed in the adage, which forbids us, .to throw&#xD;
pearls unto certain animals and understood the great art, to stop&#xD;
charity within the proper limits,&#xD;
The stranger however vas a judge. He ate and drank and&#xD;
smacked his lips.&#xD;
"Nicht uebel! not so bad; though I have drunk better growth&#xD;
on the banks of father Rhine."&#xD;
"So you hail from the Rhine?" Mrs. Fuchs inquired with in-&#xD;
creased interest--her own cradle h it been rocked to the airs in&#xD;
vogue in that favored country.&#xD;
"Yes,. I do," he said sharply and a fool's errand it was, that&#xD;
took me away frow there."&#xD;
"Would you deem it rude, if I asked you its nature?"&#xD;
"No it wouldn't. Woman are curious, that is an old truth and&#xD;
can't surprise a man of my experience."&#xD;
"Well Sir?" she suggested overlooking his freedom.&#xD;
"Well Madam, I simply went to America in quest of fortune."&#xD;
Why, I suppose everybody does that, more or less."&#xD;
"Everybody is more or less of a fool. I haven't found my&#xD;

fortune yet, tho' I have been six months in this abominable coun-&#xD;
try; yes what's worse,,I haven't found my brother."&#xD;
"Your brother? So you have relations in America."&#xD;
"Yes Madam, they are so fortunate."&#xD;
"And you expect to find your brother here? You will hardly&#xD;
succeed, for we are the only german family in the place."&#xD;
"lol's der Kukuk! the deuce take it, This was my last trump&#xD;
and if it misses, I may as well give up the game. Isn't this Fox-&#xD;
ville?"&#xD;
"That is the name of the place."&#xD;
"And there is nobody by the name of Fuchs living here ?"&#xD;
"Fuchs? Why, who said there wasn't? You said you wanted&#xD;
to find...."&#xD;
"My worthy brother Conrad Fuchs, -the senior of the family.&#xD;
If you know anything about that person and will communicate&#xD;
your knowledge to me, you will oblige Jacob Fuchs his younger&#xD;
brother."&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs was astonished. She was more, than that, she was&#xD;
overpowered. The ties of relationship are closer in Germany&#xD;
than in any other country and even the cousin in the 10th degree&#xD;
continues to be counted amongst the kindred. But this was her&#xD;
husband's own brother! at least he said -so and in the simplicity&#xD;
of her heart she never thought of doubting his statement. She&#xD;
clasped her hands in astonishment and taking the hand of the&#xD;
stranger into hers, she embraced and kissed him, totally forget-&#xD;
ting his rough and uncouth ways and by divers exclamations en-&#xD;
deavoring to assemble the rest of the familiy.&#xD;
"Why is it possible ! she cried, my husband's own brother! his&#xD;
only brother, Jacob-if I have been rightly informed-my, good&#xD;
dear brother-in-law! Oh! how Conrad will rejoice! Of this he&#xD;
never dreamed, to be sure. Husband Conrad! Charles ! Henry!&#xD;
why dont you come? Your uncle Jacob is here! Your uncle&#xD;
Jacob in his own selfsame person !"&#xD;
Now in her zeal thegood dame forgot, that her husband and&#xD;
the boys were at the factory at that moment, or at least ought to&#xD;
have been there, tho' master Henry wasn't, for, obedient to his&#xD;
mother's call, he soon afterwards emerged from the house. This&#xD;
didn't at all strike her as odd, on the contrary, she wondered at&#xD;
the absence of the others, inquiring for the reason. Only when&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES-                       123&#xD;
Henry replied, that they were probably at the factory she remem-&#xD;
bered the connecting circumstances, hinting to the lad, that it&#xD;
wouldn't at all be amiss for him, to be there also. But this was&#xD;
not the day to scold and telling Henry, that he saw his uncle be-&#xD;
fore him and vide verra she begged her honored gupst, to excuse&#xD;
her a few moments, in order to prepare for the reception of so&#xD;
worthy a person. Jacob Fuchs did excuse her, enjoying the bread&#xD;
butter and cheese like one famished, setting down the inferior&#xD;
quality of the wine on account of the ignorance of his claims.&#xD;
While eating and drinking, he eyed and addressed ,his young&#xD;
nephew, who in his turn showed by his suspicious scornful&#xD;
glances, that he was far from sharing his mother's enthusiasm.&#xD;
But Jacob wasn't easily disconcerted.&#xD;
"Heinrich, my lad," he said coolly, after finishing his first bot-&#xD;
tle "you would greatly, oblige me, by getting this exchanged.&#xD;
Just tell your mother, that I.prefer Deidesheini Traminer to all&#xD;
other kinds and if she should happen, to keep, that sort...."&#xD;
Henry obeyed with a bad grace; but returning carried a flask&#xD;
bearing the etiquette mentioned. Uncle Jacob was pleased, he&#xD;
was considerably softened and with every new glass seemed to&#xD;
imbibe the very essence of the milk of human kindness.&#xD;
"Why, Henry, my boy" he said, "this meeting is as pleasant,&#xD;
as it is unexpected. After wandering six months through their&#xD;
hospitable wilderness of these United States, I meet at last the&#xD;
brother, whom I intended to surprise and-to make rich and in-&#xD;
dependant."&#xD;
Henry began to listen. Richard independant? This shably&#xD;
uncle, that was so hungry and thirsty like a beggar,-to make hi&#xD;
father rich and independant? Yes indeed, lie-Henry--would&#xD;
first see it and then believe it; but not sooner. His uncle's remark&#xD;
therefore sharpened the look of scorn around his mouth. The&#xD;
stranger saw it:&#xD;
"That sounds funny, Henry, doesn't it?" he inquired "never-&#xD;
mind the fun, my boy; it will by and by become dead earnest, I&#xD;
assure you. You seem to be be tolerably well fixed here."&#xD;
Henry stated, that they were fixed well enough for everyday&#xD;
aspirations.&#xD;
"A fine house?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes !"&#xD;
&#xD;

DOLORES.                   125&#xD;
&#xD;
"And much land?"&#xD;
"Some 5 acres around the building."&#xD;
"And other sources of revenue?"&#xD;
Henry felt, as if prudence dictated discretion towards a com-&#xD;
parative stranger. But this was his incle, and that uncle had&#xD;
boasted of making his'relatives rich. Indeed Henry felt much&#xD;
disposed to exaggerate his father's means to impress this new&#xD;
uncle of such shably looks and high pretentious. So he asserted&#xD;
that his father had ever so much stock in banks and other papers&#xD;
from which he derived a splendid revenue.&#xD;
The stranger listened attentively. These qualifications of a&#xD;
brother seemed very acceptable, but Henry thought his display&#xD;
made hardly the effect, which he had expected.&#xD;
"Very well, Henry" the newcomer said, "very well indeed; but&#xD;
what has been the result of it? What is your father doing?"&#xD;
"Working in Mr. Fox' Factory, as foreman though."&#xD;
At the word "Fox" the stranger started, but collecting himself&#xD;
he said:&#xD;
"Foreman indeed. And your brother-didn't you say, you&#xD;
had another brother?"-&#xD;
"I did Sir. He working in the factory as volunteer, to learn&#xD;
the trade."&#xD;
" Volunteer! Just a little gilding, to smooth the rough name.&#xD;
I think, he will soon volunteer at pleasanter work. And you my&#xD;
boy?"&#xD;
Henry took good care, not to tell him, that he too would have&#xD;
been at the factory, if his indomitable pench ant to idleness had&#xD;
not induced him to make a blue monday, which lpractise with him&#xD;
often extended over the whole week. Henry had not yet resolved&#xD;
.upon an answer when his uncle saved bim the trouble, by saying:&#xD;
"Never mind, lenry, what you are doing. I shall give you a&#xD;
chance of doing better. I am not joking, lad ; but in sober&#xD;
earnest you seem to be a clever sensible boy and I have no doubt,&#xD;
we shall get along swimmingly together. Reach me- your hand:&#xD;
what do you think? Are you willing to form a treaty of offense&#xD;
and defense with the uncle, that can soon make you "steinreich"&#xD;
i. e. possessing more gold, than you have now stones on your&#xD;
premises?"&#xD;
Henry was clever, but he was also credulous like most persons,&#xD;
&#xD;
who dislike labor and look for unexpected turnups and sudden&#xD;
chances to take the place of industry and perseverance. His&#xD;
uncle might possibly be more than an idle boaster and in such a&#xD;
case, would it not be very profitable, to worm himself into his good&#xD;
graces, before the rest of the family had a change? If such a con-&#xD;
duct should not result in great profit, it could hardly do much&#xD;
harm and the youth instantly resolved, to assume a different&#xD;
mien towards this Croesis in a beggar's garb. So he laid his hand&#xD;
into his uncle's extended palm with a good enough grace and sig-&#xD;
nified his readiness, to tie with him the knot of firm friendship&#xD;
and mutual good will. Indeed this union had nothing strange&#xD;
about .it; if the younger partner was as yet lacking the callous&#xD;
skin, the brazen face and the ready wit of the vagrant, by means&#xD;
of which he eeks out a living, which promised these qualities in&#xD;
rich profusion and a family resemblance between the pair was un-&#xD;
mistakable. They had no further chance, to advance their inti-&#xD;
macy just then, for Mrs. Fuchs appearing in the door, begged her&#xD;
guest to enter and retire to the room, she had hastily prepared for&#xD;
him. He would find a bath prepared she said and plenty of Con-&#xD;
rad's clothes in the closet, in case he wanted to replenish his ward-&#xD;
robe. She hoped he would enjoy the bath and feel refreshed by&#xD;
it. Supper would be ready in a couple of hours and the rest of&#xD;
the family home by that time, tho' she wouldn't wait that long,&#xD;
but send Henry to the factory without delay, in order to take to&#xD;
her husband and Charles the glad tidings.&#xD;
Uncle Jacob submitted to her directions with the grace of a&#xD;
man, that has learned to weather the storms of the world. Tak-&#xD;
ing his carpet-bag he suffered himself to be shown into his room,&#xD;
while Henry betook himself to the. factory, to inform his father&#xD;
and brother. He did not overhasten himself however, but walk-&#xD;
ing slowly pondered on this unexpected event, on his uncle's&#xD;
mysterious hints and their possible consequences. He did not&#xD;
exactly know, how to take his amiable relation, but he was ready&#xD;
enough, to benefit by his assistance and before reaching the fac-&#xD;
tory, he had fully resolved, to have a chance at the fat things in&#xD;
prospect and not allow -the others to step in before him, as they&#xD;
were want to do.&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs and Charles were busily engaged in calculating&#xD;
something lying oin their workbench; their backs were turned&#xD;

owards the messenger and both were considerably startled, when&#xD;
Henry with intentional abruptness, cried out to them:&#xD;
"Father! mother wants you at home: uncle Jacob from Ger-&#xD;
many has come."&#xD;
"Who has come, Henry ?" Mr. Fuchs asked with a surprise&#xD;
bordering on bewilderment.&#xD;
"He has been in the cellar, father" Charles suggested with an&#xD;
ironical smile, "he has paid a visit to the rhine-wine and seen&#xD;
visions of home."&#xD;
A cold hateful glance from Henry's eye resented the irony.&#xD;
"You are right, I have been in the cellar" he replied, "I have&#xD;
also fetched up wine, but not for myself; I tell you again, 'uncle&#xD;
Jacob has come and mother wants you to come home."&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs shook his head. This seemed Ivery. incredible to&#xD;
him for reasons of his own. Turning to Charles he said: -&#xD;
"What can this mean? I have not seen nor corresponded with&#xD;
my brother for more than twenty years: could it be hardly pos-&#xD;
sible...."&#xD;
"We can easily find out father. Somebody must have come&#xD;
and I suppose we may as well go home, to see. Henry run back&#xD;
to tell mother, we are coming. We shall just wash a little and&#xD;
see to things before we start."&#xD;
Charlie's word was law to Henry ; morethan his parents'. True&#xD;
he hated his brother for the authority he exercised over him; but&#xD;
still he obeyed, therein resembling most other slavish spirits, who&#xD;
smile and lick spittle in their betters' face and make a fist at them&#xD;
within their pocket.&#xD;
So on master Henry strolled. His relatives however prepared&#xD;
to leave the. factory, pondering on the news, that had been&#xD;
brought to them and wondering what it could mean.&#xD;
"It cannot be, it surely cannot be" Mr. Fuchs continued to&#xD;
reiterate.&#xD;
"Why not, fatherr" Charles, replied,' struck by something&#xD;
peculiar in his father's manner. "If your brother is living, he&#xD;
surely might have come, for though you did not correspond with&#xD;
him, he might have easily got our address from other friends at&#xD;
home. Is their anything special, that makes you think, he&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.               127&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs was the prey of uneasiness and hesitancy. For a.&#xD;
few moments, he remained silent; then however he replied:&#xD;
"My Charlie, you are more of a man and a friend to me, than&#xD;
many another boy would be. I can trust you without fear. I am&#xD;
glad you sent Henry back; for I can now give you a few hints&#xD;
concerning this brother of mine, that may prove useful, in case&#xD;
he should really have come."&#xD;
By this time, the two had left the factory and begun to walk&#xD;
towards the house, which was not far distant, as the reader will&#xD;
recollect.&#xD;
"I must be brief, Charlie," Mr. Fuchs co menced again Jacob,&#xD;
you know, was my only brother. I hate to say evil things about&#xD;
him, but the truth is, that he from his ear y childhood was the&#xD;
black sheep of the family. Often when I ee Henry's wayward-&#xD;
ness, I can't help thinking, that he bears a trong resemblance to&#xD;
his uncle and that thought needs makes m wretched. I cannot&#xD;
tell you Jacob's misdemeanors in detail, m. son, but shall merely&#xD;
state, that he managed by his intrigues to eprive me of my par-&#xD;
ent's affection and finally to drive me fro  my native home; to&#xD;
seek another beyond the ocean. The wound he thus struck me,&#xD;
has healed long ago and I bear my brother no malice. I have&#xD;
even abstained from mentioning anything about it to your mother&#xD;
for nobody likes to blacken his own kindred. But now this is,&#xD;
different of course. If your uncle has really come,-a thing I am&#xD;
strongly inclined to doubt,-my duty requires me, to give you a&#xD;
hint, so as to guard against the evil consequences of any intrigues&#xD;
he may feel disposed to spin. If on the other hand he has re-&#xD;
formed and comes with good intentions, why my communications&#xD;
will be buried in your breast and not prevent you from doing jus-&#xD;
tice to your uncle. Am I right Charlie?"&#xD;
"Right as ever, father. I thank you for your confidence and&#xD;
promise you to treat this uncle according to his merits, provided&#xD;
some strange vagrant has nof, imposed on mother. But here we&#xD;
are and shall soon know, what it amounts too. There is mother&#xD;
in a glow."&#xD;
He was right. When they stepped into the house, Mrs. Fuchs&#xD;
met them with a countenance, so fluttered and excited, that she&#xD;
didn't at all look like herself.&#xD;
"Oh! there you are at last" she cried.  I thought you would&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7070-00000065"/>&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
never come. And how sober you look ! I declare, you don't seem&#xD;
to.be glad at all. Didn't Henry tell you, that brother Jacob has&#xD;
arrived?"&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs was going to explain; but Charles laying his haud&#xD;
on his father's arm, stopped him saying:&#xD;
"Leave -mother to me father, you better go up at once and look&#xD;
to the stranger. We must of course identify his person before&#xD;
we can proceed."&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs nodded and ascending the stairway, left his wife and&#xD;
son to themselves. Charles laid his hand around his mother's&#xD;
waist and closeted himself with her in a neighboring room.&#xD;
When a few minutes afterwards they appeared again, the face of&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs had much sobered down; indeed she looked so gloomy&#xD;
that Charles thought it necessary, to caution her.&#xD;
"Cheer up mother dear" he whispered in her ear. "Remember&#xD;
our visitor must not see this change, nor Henry either. The boy&#xD;
is not considerate enough to be trusted. Moreover, all may be&#xD;
right, you know, and we may still rejoice, at our kindman's com-&#xD;
."&#xD;
"You are my good, clever boy" she replied, looking tenderly&#xD;
into his noble face "and I shall endeavor to control myself. But&#xD;
listen, they are coming."&#xD;
She was right. A door up-stairs opened and the sharp snap-&#xD;
pish voice of the stranger penetrated in all its modulations&#xD;
through the house.&#xD;
"I don't like his voice" Charles whispered to his mother, "if&#xD;
his person isn't more agreable.... ."-&#xD;
He hadn't time to finish, for already the stranger was descend-&#xD;
ing in company of Mr. Fuchs.&#xD;
"Aye! aye!" they heard him say, "just in time brother Conrad,&#xD;
just in time, to recruit my strength and purse. I .tell you, they&#xD;
are both considerably, exhausted."&#xD;
"I am glad Jacob, that I am able to supply to all your wants."&#xD;
It's really uncle Jacob" Charles whispered to his mother.&#xD;
"And so am I brother, so am I. Not that I want much from&#xD;
you, or long, or to .keep--no indeed, I have rather come to bestow,&#xD;
and not to take."&#xD;
"Speak plainly, Jacob, I do not understand you."&#xD;
"Of course you don't, Conrad, I do not wish you should. All&#xD;
&#xD;
in due season you know, in due season. But whom have we here?&#xD;
Ah my good sister-in-law, the Samaritan, who fed the stranger&#xD;
without knowing him, though the wine she gave me, was a beg.&#xD;
garly wine. And this young chap? ah I recollect, you have&#xD;
another boy. Charles-isn't that your name my son?"&#xD;
"Nephew, uncle, you mean to say. I am Charles Fuchs and at&#xD;
your service."&#xD;
These words less, than the manner of utterance excercised as a&#xD;
check upon uncle Jacob, at least as far as Charles was concerned.&#xD;
The young man practiced that effectual means of holding at the&#xD;
(listance-overdrawn politeness-than which there is no better&#xD;
remedy. It acts like so many weapons, thrust against the rude&#xD;
invader, repelling his advances like pointed bayonets of a needles&#xD;
sharpness. Uncle Jacob could not break down Charles defences&#xD;
then, nor-indeed-afterwards and we may as well state at. once,&#xD;
that the relation between uncle and nephew never became a cor-&#xD;
dial one. Mr. Fuchs could be bullied, his wife persuaded, and&#xD;
Henry coaxed ; but Charles preserved his distant politeness or&#xD;
rather his polite distance and proved a most effectual barrier to&#xD;
uncle Jacob's forwardness. That gentleman felt an indistinct&#xD;
aversion to the young man and this similarity of feeling soon be-&#xD;
came a new bond of fellowship between the new comer and Henry,&#xD;
so that they were mostly in each other's company.&#xD;
"Thank you, Sir, thank you indeed" the visitor replied. "Uncle&#xD;
Jacob may call on you, before you think it; though he is not the&#xD;
man, to accept services without compensation. But sister Bar-&#xD;
bara, I see you are getting impatient and so am I. If you'll lead&#xD;
the way to the dining-room, I shall show you without delay, how&#xD;
my little lunch of before has prepared my stomach for a good&#xD;
supper."&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs opened a door and the company entered a room,&#xD;
where a very acceptable meal had been spread. Uncle Jacob was&#xD;
the first one to sit down ; he had already pitched1Aeeply into the&#xD;
mysteries of a half a dozen dishes, .before the others had taken&#xD;
up their knives and forks.&#xD;
"You do pretty well for America, madam," he said with'a con-&#xD;
descending nod, without letting his speaking interfere with his&#xD;
eating "and if a glass of good Rhinewine washes the victuals&#xD;
down, they pass to their receptacle in a pleasant enough manner.&#xD;

Brother Conrad, I hope you have provided yourself tolerably&#xD;
well with this sort of wine. You recollect, I always preferred it&#xD;
to all others."&#xD;
"Indeed I don't Jacob."&#xD;
"Well, take my word for it then, brother. I'll do my best in&#xD;
helping you finish your supply and then it shall be my turn to&#xD;
treat and you must assist me, as I do you now. Only wait, u14&#xD;
I make my fortune....."&#xD;
"Oh you are going to make your fortune uncle?"&#xD;
Uncle Jacob was annoyed and for a moment felt inclined to re.&#xD;
sent Charles irony; but the face of the young man didn't look&#xD;
at all inviting, so he checked his vexations and said with a laugh:&#xD;
"Indeed I am, though you seem inclined to make light of it.&#xD;
Ju  wait until I call you all in a familycouncil; for then you will&#xD;
hear astounding disclosures. But now we are at supper friends&#xD;
and it is my principal to always do with undivided energy, whet&#xD;
I am doing. So please, sister, to reach me some of that pudding&#xD;
and, brother, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, to replace this&#xD;
empty bottle by a full one-thank you, sir. I love to deal with&#xD;
people that take tender hints and needn't be winked at with&#xD;
fence posts."&#xD;
Any one seeing uncle Jacob at his supper wouldn't entertain the&#xD;
least doubt, that he was concentrating all his energy upon that&#xD;
work. If his other undertakings all resembled this, he surely&#xD;
was a pushing fellow and the search after fortune might be suc-&#xD;
cessful. True, thus far he had evidently failed, judging from the&#xD;
shabby garments he had now exchanged for better ones of his&#xD;
host and brother; but then the best pointer may sometimes lose&#xD;
the scent ; and there is hope as long as there is life. Uncle&#xD;
Jacob's life was very tenacious; for if all the adventures and&#xD;
hardships, of this with the narration of which he entertained the&#xD;
family, were true, he surely could boast of having borne what&#xD;
nine tenths of mankind would be unable to endure.&#xD;
At last they arose. The visitor's capacity of receiving and&#xD;
storing food had by no means been entirely exhausted; but he&#xD;
managed to take a bottle of wine and a plate of cake into the&#xD;
parlor comforting himself with the thought, that it wasn't much&#xD;
farther to the cellar and pantry from there than from the dining-&#xD;
o-omi and that at all events this labor fell to the lot of others.&#xD;

DOLORES.                       131&#xD;
The evenings were getting long and Mrs. Fuchs found it ne-&#xD;
cessary to light the fine lamp, which graced the mantlepiece and&#xD;
was only used for extraordinary occasions. Its light drew a pleas&#xD;
ant comfortable glow over the room and uncle Jacob, who had&#xD;
planted himself into the most comfortable easechair of the room,&#xD;
had good reason to congratulate himself, to have found a home,&#xD;
which contrasted strangely with the adventurous life, he had lat-&#xD;
ely led and appeared to exercise a double charm in prospect of&#xD;
the coming winter. He had lit a cigar without in the least as-&#xD;
certaining Mrs. Fuchs' sentime t concerning this privilege and&#xD;
the pleasure of puffing off rings nd columns of smoke had for a&#xD;
while even overcome the enjoyment of letting his tongue run and&#xD;
keeping his auditors in suspense with scenes and sketches of his&#xD;
past life, which were entirely more striking than probable&#xD;
During one of these lulls, the gate of the garden was heard to&#xD;
swing and then a knock at the door betrayed the coming of&#xD;
another visitor.&#xD;
"Why that is Dol" Charles exclaimed, springing to his feet and&#xD;
hastening towards the door. "She was to come this evening;&#xD;
ut we forgot through uncles arrival."&#xD;
He left the room and a minute afterwards reappeared in com-&#xD;
pany of a young lady. It is well that we know from Charlie's&#xD;
words, who stands before us, or we would surely not recognize&#xD;
our former friend. This young stately creature the little girl of&#xD;
old? In this splendidly devolped form we do not recognize the&#xD;
angular points of a wandering minstrel girl, who by her painful&#xD;
leanness awoke the pity of charitable souls? Charles tells us,.it&#xD;
is his friend Dolores and we surely have no reason to doubt his&#xD;
word. The black massy curls are there, as of old; so is the fiery&#xD;
eye, though moderated and subdued by gentle, sweetness and a&#xD;
look of thoughtfulness, which speaks of mental treasures under-&#xD;
neath. Her complexion is not very white, but clear and trans-&#xD;
parent, showing the slightest variations of the' purple flood be-&#xD;
neath. Her teetl are perfect and as she greets the company as-&#xD;
semnbled, a smile of exquisite beauty flits over her perfect feat-&#xD;
ures. They are now fully developed and the promise of the bud&#xD;
has been fulfilled by the open flower. She is-but no! I shall&#xD;
not attempt to paint a beauty, which defies the painter's brush,&#xD;
much more the sharp point, with which the author is to depict&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
A LETTER.&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs arose and with motherly care, took the hat and&#xD;
shawl of the visitor.&#xD;
"You are late Dol" she said-having long ago adopted Charles&#xD;
mode of naming her-"we had almost given you up."&#xD;
"I had to wait for papa," she said, casting a sideglance at the&#xD;
stranger on the arm chair. "He intended coming with me, but&#xD;
being suddenly prevented by pressing business, sent James along,&#xD;
too see me safely to the cottage. It wasn't necessary" she added&#xD;
with a light laugh "for I am no at all afraid ; but papa wills it so&#xD;
and like a dutiful daughter I obe ." -&#xD;
After this Charles took it upon imself, to inform his friend of&#xD;
the great event of the day. First her eye brightened consider-&#xD;
ably at the news of the arrival of a uncle from Germany and she&#xD;
welcomed the stranger in his native tongue with her usual warmth&#xD;
of expression; but when he an vered in his cynic style and in&#xD;
course of the evening displayed traits of character not at all com-&#xD;
*       mendable,.she shrank from the new comer, becoming rather taci-&#xD;
turn and merely casting uncertain glances on his vulgar features,&#xD;
when she thought she could do this without observation.&#xD;
Uncle Jacob in the meantime continued his libations and from&#xD;
the growing freedom of expression and total absence of restraint&#xD;
it became evident, that fiery wine began to make a marked im-&#xD;
pression upon his brain. Becoming more boastful and vainglori-&#xD;
ous every minute, at last he said:&#xD;
"This wine is good, verteufelt good. It opens man's heart, as&#xD;
the poet says; it surely opened mine. I did not mean to make&#xD;
you so early the recipients of the golden news, I bear within my&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                    133&#xD;
&#xD;
pocket; but you have been so clever to uncle Jacob, that he' an-&#xD;
not think of leaving you in the dark any longer. Yes indeed, you&#xD;
have not honored a niggardly uncle as my communications will&#xD;
soon show. Brother Conrad, do you recollect our great grand-&#xD;
uncle Eberhard?"&#xD;
"Yes, Jacob, I do. Grandfather often spoke to us about him.&#xD;
He had a restless roving disposition, visiting all the countries on&#xD;
the globe and finally dying far from home, nobody knows, where."&#xD;
"Nobody knew where, you better say; for lately documents&#xD;
have been discovered, which make it almost certain, that he died&#xD;
on the cost of Maine, probably in the neighborhood."&#xD;
"Indeed?" Conrad inquired with that curiosity, which is so na-&#xD;
tural, when the destiny of some member of the family is made&#xD;
th'e topic of conversation. The others also listened to uncle&#xD;
Jacob with more attention, than they had hitherto evinced during&#xD;
the evening, ithout however in the least understanding what the&#xD;
history of a great grand-uncle could have to do, with the golden&#xD;
news, that had been promised.&#xD;
"Indeed?" he said "that must have been quite recently; for it&#xD;
is altogether new to me. How did that happen?"&#xD;
"Why, this way. You recollect our grant aunt Sarah, who&#xD;
died an old maid a number of years ago."&#xD;
"Of course, I do. We received a little legacy from her."&#xD;
"Exactly. Well, about a year ago the house in which she had&#xD;
lived and which had lbeen in the Fuchs' Family for many gener-&#xD;
ations, was repaired and on removing some old rubbish on the&#xD;
garret, a box with musty papers was discovered, which on closer&#xD;
examination proved to contain family documents. The owner&#xD;
not belonging to the old stock and hearing about my temporary&#xD;
presence in the town, sent for me and on my ar 4al at the house&#xD;
delivered the whole box into my hands. I caus d it at once to be&#xD;
removed to my lodgings and feeling rather curious to learn the&#xD;
nature of the papers, began to examine them. It was a tedious&#xD;
task. Most of the papers were diaries, treating on the income&#xD;
and expenses of the Fuchs' for many a year. To me they were&#xD;
extremely indifferent, or rather a course of vexation, for it made&#xD;
me angry to think, that such large sums had once been handled&#xD;
by my ancestors and yet not a cent come down to my poor person.&#xD;
I was already on the point of delivering the whole plunder to the&#xD;

fire, when all at once a name and date attractd my attention&#xD;
and kept my eye like riveted to the document on which they stood.&#xD;
The name was Eberhardt Fuchs and the date the year 1760."&#xD;
"Well, what more ? Go on uncle Jacob" Charles urged the nar&#xD;
rator, who had stopped for a moment.'&#xD;
"Ah! the young gentleman gets interested", Jacob Fuchs&#xD;
remarked with a grin and evident satisfaction at the other's im -&#xD;
patience. "Well, I'm coming; only give me a moment's time, to&#xD;
produce the document."&#xD;
With these words he put his hand into his coat pocket and&#xD;
drew out a large and old-fashioned diary which was firmly secured-&#xD;
by a leather-string reaching half-a-dozen times around it. Uncle&#xD;
Jacob unwoun'it slowly and with the dignity of a man, that&#xD;
knows, what he is about. At last the string was off and the cover&#xD;
yielding to the presence of the hand displayed a number of pock-&#xD;
ets all of which were empty, excepting one, that contained a yel-&#xD;
low looking paper. Jacob seized it with a solemn mien and turn-&#xD;
ing to the company remarked:&#xD;
"The time has come, when those of you that suspected uncle&#xD;
Jacob's soundness of mind, will humble themselves before him&#xD;
and eagerly beg his forgiveness. It will be easily obtained and&#xD;
readily bestowed; but Mr. Charles being the greatest skeptic, if&#xD;
I am not mistaken, deserves a little penalty, which we shall inflict&#xD;
on him, by making him read the letter to the company."&#xD;
Charles was well satisfied with this punishment ; his interest&#xD;
was awakened and fearing the delay, which would surely result&#xD;
from his uncle's pompous way, he was very willing to act in the&#xD;
capacity of reader. Taking the paper from the other's hand and&#xD;
holding it to the light, in order to decipher the lines, which time&#xD;
had half obliterated, he read:&#xD;
On Board of Rover, Gulf of Mexico.)&#xD;
;   erCrln!July 20th. 1760.(&#xD;
'Dear -Caroline !&#xD;
In spite of your interdiction, I take the pen, to write to you. I&#xD;
cannot heljit; for just as the plant turns its head to the sunlight,&#xD;
I turn to you for one smile, one word of comfort, yes of love.&#xD;
You banished me from my native home; you drive me a fugitife&#xD;
over land and sea and I shall not even have the comfort, to write&#xD;
to you? to tell you, that I love you as much, no, more than ever.&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                135&#xD;
&#xD;
This can, this must not be, and if I displease and offend you by&#xD;
this letter, I take comfort at the thought, that my approaching&#xD;
dissolution will atone for it.&#xD;
I shall not live much longer, Caroline and there is comfort in&#xD;
the thought, for it means, I shall not suffer and sin much longer.&#xD;
Suffer and sin! Yes Caroline, I have had hell in my bosom, eve.&#xD;
since you disdained my love; and reached to brother John the&#xD;
hand, which ought to have been mine. A sea of fire has been&#xD;
raging there, where others carry feelings of a gentle nature. It&#xD;
has driven me from continent {to continent and plunged me in a&#xD;
vortex of the worst of dissipations. Or do you think, that deeds&#xD;
of virtue could spring from fiery passions such as mine? No,&#xD;
Caroline, it could not be and your good and pure soul would&#xD;
shrink from me, if it could look into the dreadful abyss from&#xD;
which the deeds of my dark career have risen.&#xD;
Why do I write this down? Why do I make you, as it were,&#xD;
an accomplice of my crimes? Ah, love is selfish, Caroline and&#xD;
unrequited love yearns for revenge. You were mine, mine alone&#xD;
if deep undying passion secures a claim, and yet you gave away,&#xD;
what belonged to me and by doing so created a blank in my na-&#xD;
ture, which has never since been filled. No smile has lit my face,&#xD;
no affection warmed my heart; no sympathy has drawn me to a&#xD;
fellow being. No ray has ever shone into that blank, that dread-&#xD;
ful blank; but grim spectres have arisen there, spectres with dia-&#xD;
bolical faces, that have sneered at innocence and virtue and al-&#xD;
lured me on to a path of wickedness, on which no sin is wanting,&#xD;
that hell can boast of. You know, I never was a halfway man,&#xD;
and my love which could have made a saint of me, if requited&#xD;
has driven me to the extremes of iniquity, since you disdained it.&#xD;
I am tired of life, for life can offer nothing worth living for,&#xD;
since you are denied me. The long years of separation have been&#xD;
one continued effort, to forget yon; but that effort has been no-&#xD;
thing abut a miserable failure. Imagine then, how glad I must be,&#xD;
to see the moment approaching, when this wretched wreck of&#xD;
mine will forever disappear from the surface of.-life's ocean. I&#xD;
shall not prompt the hand of time, I am not coward enough, to&#xD;
lift my hand against myself-but I feel, I know with deep satis-&#xD;
faction, that the volcano in my bosom has nearly spent its wrath,&#xD;
that the substance feeding it, has wellnigh become exhausted.&#xD;
Farewell Caroline. I owe to you much suffering-but I also owe&#xD;
to you a happiness of bygone ,days, the very recollection of which&#xD;
would be bliss, if not embittered by the torments of jealousy. I&#xD;
do not curse you or .your memory-let that suffice; for as to&#xD;
blessing you-I have forgotten how to.&#xD;
I leave much gold; I leave it to your children. My will has&#xD;
been executed end rests safely in a- cave on the coast of Maine,&#xD;
near the large estate on which my brother Walter lives as steward.&#xD;

&#xD;
He is to have a competence, but the greatest portion goes unto&#xD;
your children, as the testament will show. I shall deposit it in&#xD;
the courts, as soon as I return there, for I feel, that my days are&#xD;
numbered.&#xD;
Do not thank me Caroline; for you have no occasion. In leav-&#xD;
ing my money to your children I hardly know, whether I act&#xD;
from motives of revenge or affection. Alas I love your little&#xD;
ones in as-far as they are part of you; but I feel malignant hate&#xD;
arising in my bosom, when I consider that they are also part of&#xD;
his.&#xD;
No, Caroline, no, thank me not! But when you sooner or later&#xD;
look upon the mementoes of a man, that died a victim of his love,&#xD;
remember with a tear&#xD;
poor Eberhardt.&#xD;
During the reading of this passionate letter a deep silence had&#xD;
been reigning in the room. Even after Charles had finished the&#xD;
echoes of soul stirring appeal continued to vibrate in the hearts&#xD;
of the hearers, and when uncle Jacob interrupted the silence with&#xD;
the exultation of the heir expectant, they felt it like a discord&#xD;
jarring upon their hearts. He evidently was callous to such silly&#xD;
sentiments; or may be, the many readings, he had given the letter&#xD;
had hardened him against its impressions.&#xD;
"Well, what now ?" he inquired, sending a triumphant glance&#xD;
"round the room "where are the skeptics, the scoffers ? Who is&#xD;
the first, to ask pardon of the benignant uncle, that is to make&#xD;
you all rich?"'&#xD;
His words in a degree dispelled the feelings of the company,&#xD;
awakened' by the reading. Charles was the first to collect him-&#xD;
self sufficiently for an answer:&#xD;
"Not quite so fast uncle!" he exclaimed with a smile on his&#xD;
lips. This letter is a fine document and well calculated to set our&#xD;
hearts throbbing; but it is merely a promise uncle and a promise&#xD;
and its fulfilment are two different things. Before we humble&#xD;
ourselves before you in sackcloth and ashes, tell us, where is the&#xD;
testament of the writer?"&#xD;
"The testament? Ah-hm-well the testament is-is at a&#xD;
place, of which I am not exactly aware ; that is, I presume I have&#xD;
my idea . ."&#xD;
"And what is your idea, uncle?"_&#xD;
Uncle Jacob cleared his throat and arranged his cravat. Then&#xD;
he emptied a glass of wine in a draft and finally said:&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        137&#xD;
"You see, the letter speaks about the courts...."&#xD;
"But which courts uncle ?"&#xD;
"That's more, than I can tell; but Eberhardt Fuchs evidently&#xD;
means the courts of Maine."&#xD;
"There are many courts in Maine, uncle."&#xD;
"Pshaw! nephew, I know all that; but there number is not so&#xD;
large, that we couldn't soon find out, whether the last will of a cer-&#xD;
tain Eberhardt Fuchs, or Fox had been recorded there."&#xD;
"Fuchs or Fox?" Charles inquired with increased attention,&#xD;
.what do you mean by these two names?"&#xD;
I mean simply that from a diary of,our Great grand aunt it is&#xD;
evident, that Eberhardts brother Walter, mentioned in this letter&#xD;
had changed his German name of Fuchs to the English equival-&#xD;
ent of Fox."&#xD;
The family exchanged glances; but there seemed to be a tacit&#xD;
agreement tt leave to Charles the office of speaker.&#xD;
"That brings us nearer home indeed" the young man remarked&#xD;
thoughtfully, "for there is a family of Fox in' this village, who&#xD;
have been here for several generations and in case of the correct-&#xD;
liess of your statements would be our relatives. Just think of it&#xD;
mother! you the cousin of proud Mrs. Fox in the mansion!&#xD;
Won't she enjoy the idea tho'?"&#xD;
Charles laughed heartily, turning his eyes from his mother to&#xD;
the fair visitor at his side, who sat there the very picture of sus-&#xD;
pense and excitement. However before Mrs. Fuchs or anybody&#xD;
else could reply to Charlie's remark, uncle Jacob hadsnatched up&#xD;
the word, saying:&#xD;
"Let her enjoy it or not, dear nephew; that can be very indif-&#xD;
ferent to us. Let us discover the testament, the precious testa-&#xD;
ment, and we may laugh at her displeasure; for displeased she&#xD;
will be, I am sure, on receiving short notice to quit and make&#xD;
room for better people.. Yes. she wont like it, I dare say."&#xD;
"But even if we find the testament uncle, you forget that this&#xD;
Mr. Eberhardt makes his brother joint heir with the children of&#xD;
Caroline."&#xD;
"Pshaw ! a trifle, a bonus, a bone thrown to the dogs. Don't&#xD;
he speak of munch gold, and that his brother John is merely to&#xD;
have a competence?"&#xD;
&#xD;

138                    DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
"That is true, and if you find the testament you may indeed be&#xD;
able to compel Mrs. Fox, to move her trucks. .&#xD;
"Ali there ! I am glad you think so!"&#xD;
A silence followed these words and the company was evidently&#xD;
the prey of some embarrasment. At last Mrs. Fuchs drew a&#xD;
breath saying.&#xD;
"I 'for my part hope, it won't be found. I don't like to drive&#xD;
people out of their possessions."&#xD;
"Nor I!" said Charles promptly, his father joining him. Henry&#xD;
kept silent, his eager eye watching his uncle's lips,"&#xD;
"Are you crazy?" Jacob inquired, letting his wondering eye&#xD;
wander from one member of the family to the other. "That is&#xD;
down right madness. But if you want to play the sympathizing&#xD;
fools, bear well in mind, that uncle Jacob will not keep your com-&#xD;
pany, I haven't for nothing set my last farthing on the success-&#xD;
ful establishment of this claim, and if you are willing to forego&#xD;
your rights, I for one shall push mine with, every particle of&#xD;
strength in my possession.'&#xD;
Another silence, which uncle Jacob employed, to drain another&#xD;
glass of wine. Charles was the first to speak again.&#xD;
"I do not blame you much, for your determination; for you do&#xD;
not, like us, entertain friendly relations to the family concerned. I&#xD;
acknowledge, that you have a right to investigate this case; but&#xD;
I feel extremely doubtful, whether you will succeed.- If such a&#xD;
will as that this letter speaks about had ever been . filed in our&#xD;
courts, we could hardly have failed to learn something about it.&#xD;
However it is not impossible, and if you do succeed, I shall not&#xD;
be slow to congratulate you."&#xD;
"Charles, how can you speak so?" his mother inquired with&#xD;
tones of reproach. "Does it not clearly appear from that letter,&#xD;
that the gold of Eberhardt Fuchs is the result of sin -and iniquity?&#xD;
It is dated on board a vessel: have you forgotten the story in the&#xD;
mouth of the people concerning a certain pirate, who bore the&#xD;
name of Fox?"&#xD;
"No, mother, I haven't. I never believed in it; but now I&#xD;
think, I was mistaken."&#xD;
"And such gold you would rejoice in?"&#xD;
"Mothers I did not say so. I merely said, that I should con-&#xD;
gratulate uncle Jacob, in case he should succeed in establishing&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        139&#xD;
his claim. iMoreover our opinion concerning this ancestors of&#xD;
ours merelg rests:on a supposition; let us at least give him the&#xD;
benefit of a doubt."&#xD;
The miens of uncle Jacob showed a nervous restlessness.&#xD;
Helping himself to-more wine and gulping it down as if desirous&#xD;
of gathering strength and resolution from it, he snapped his&#xD;
fingers, saying&#xD;
"You are a pious set, you are. When a member of the family&#xD;
comes across the ocean, a man that is tied to you by bonds of&#xD;
blood, and holds out to you the prospect of unbounded wealth,&#xD;
You say "f" into his face and would rather see him die in want&#xD;
and poverty, than have a family of strangers come to harm. I&#xD;
call that mean, and when you set up wry faces and cross yourself&#xD;
against the demon, that helped amass the gold and may be guards&#xD;
it all the while, I call that ridiculous."&#xD;
"Don't get excited, brother Jacob" Mr. Fuchs now exhorted&#xD;
the visitor, whose flushed countenance threatened further com-&#xD;
plications. "Keep calm and let us all sleep upon this wonderful&#xD;
relation, before we make it the matter of further deliberations,"&#xD;
"well, I have no objections" Jacob said, "only the matter ought&#xD;
to be kept amongst ourselves. If we allow it, our adversary may&#xD;
take measures to strengthen his position. The family I hope,&#xD;
will keep the secret and that young lady...."&#xD;
"All eyes were turning to Dolores, who in the excitement of the&#xD;
discovery had been overlooked.&#xD;
She blushed, but after a moment's hesitation replied:&#xD;
"I shall respect your secret, sir, although you are conspiring&#xD;
against a man, who is my father ard my benefactor."&#xD;
"What!" uncle Jacob exclaimed with indignation, "she a&#xD;
(laughter of this man and I received no warning?"&#xD;
"She is a foster-daughter, uncle" Charles replied, "but I go bail&#xD;
for her secrecy."&#xD;
"A foster-daughter?" Jacob returned and his look became quite&#xD;
Vague and absent. "She looks, as if she wasp a member of the&#xD;
family. There was a miniature picture amongst aunt Sarah's&#xD;
things, that looked exactly like her. Are you sure she is not a&#xD;
relative of ours?"&#xD;
"Sure, uncle! She is Italian by birth and her name is Gatana."&#xD;
"Gatana? That name sounds strange to me, tho' one of Caro.&#xD;

line's sons went to Italy and settled there. He was a painter and&#xD;
a roving fellow like his uncle Eberhardt, though nothing evil&#xD;
could ever be, said of him. He married in Rome and had a son&#xD;
who also became a painter and a celebrated one too. I shouldn't&#xD;
know this, if it hadn't been for a diary of our great grand-mother,&#xD;
which fell into my hands with this letter."&#xD;
"You have her diary?" Charles inquired eagerly. "0, let me&#xD;
see it, uncle, for she must have been a wonderful woman, who&#xD;
could inspire such a violent passion.'&#xD;
"Indeed, I never could see anything wonderful about her looks-&#xD;
or her writings. There was a picture of hers in the box."&#xD;
"But the diary, uncle, the diary!"&#xD;
"I am sorry, I cannot give it-to you just now; it is in my car-&#xD;
petbag. But if you'll have patience till to-morrow...&#xD;
"Of course uncle, I can wait that long. To-morrow morning&#xD;
then, I shall call on you for the papers."_&#xD;
The conversation now turned on other points; but it was flat&#xD;
and dragging, as might well be expected after such startling dis-&#xD;
closures.  Uncle Jacob moreover by this time reached the&#xD;
drowsy stadium of drunkenness and after a good deal of nodding&#xD;
was gone into the land of dreams. Delicacy of feeling prevented&#xD;
the family from making commentaries on himand his doings and&#xD;
other topics proving stale, the family retired sooner, than was&#xD;
customary. Dolores gave the signal, by rising and signifying her&#xD;
intention to depart for home. James having beent ordered at a&#xD;
later hour, the company of Charles was offered and accepted and&#xD;
soon the young couple wandered under a starry sky. But the&#xD;
heart of Dolores was too full. to remain unopened and stopping&#xD;
suddenly she exclaimed:&#xD;
"0 ! Charlie, this is wonderful! almost as strange as our ad-&#xD;
venture in the cave."-&#xD;
"You see the the bearing then, 1)ol, which both events 'have&#xD;
upon one another?",&#xD;
"I think I do, Charlie, though I tremble at making my deduc-&#xD;
tions. Mr. Fox' ancestor a pirate'!"&#xD;
"Why dont you say, and mine too!"&#xD;
"Because, I couldn't think of wounding thus your feeling."&#xD;
Charles smiled.&#xD;
"I am not so easily wounded, D~ol, as that. Uncle .Jacob would&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES. .,141&#xD;
be proud of the connexion, if that could only secure his money,"&#xD;
."Uncle Jacob is no favorite of mine; pardon me for saying that&#xD;
much of a relative of yours."&#xD;
"There is no occasion for asking pardon, Dol. You know we&#xD;
never differed much in judgment."&#xD;
"So you don't like him either?"&#xD;
"Like him? I have a notion to make you ask my pardon now."&#xD;
"And you think, there is 'not much danger of his finding the&#xD;
testament?"&#xD;
"Not much danger of his finding it; but I know a couple, who&#xD;
might have better chances."&#xD;
Again the girl started. Stopping short, she said.&#xD;
"You mean us two: could it be barely possible that the cave&#xD;
should still hold the secret?"&#xD;
"Not only possible; but almost certain unless the ancestors of&#xD;
your foster-father discovered and destroyed the document,in or-&#xD;
der to improve their claim."&#xD;
"That would have been a crime?"&#xD;
Charles shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
"Few men are overscrupulous, where money is concerned.&#xD;
Take uncle Jacob as an example : lie would do many things, I&#xD;
venture, which are not recorded in the book of honor, to approp-&#xD;
riate the prize, he is in search of."&#xD;
When Dolores did not reply, lie continued:&#xD;
"No, I think the willstill lies secreted, where the pirate buried&#xD;
it and I have but little doubt, that the cave is the spot. How&#xD;
fortunate, that our term of probation is drawing to a close."&#xD;
',Why Charlie, you think of aiding this man against my father?"&#xD;
"No, Dol; you must not look at in this light. The finding of&#xD;
the will may be as propicious to Mr. Fox as to us and then, it is&#xD;
more than likely, that the place which hides the testament, will&#xD;
also contain a portion, may be a large portion of the treasures of&#xD;
which the letter speaks."&#xD;
"Then you think, that the unhappy man never returned to the&#xD;
cave?"&#xD;
"Returned perhaps to die there. Don't you remember the tale&#xD;
I told you, Dol ?"&#xD;
"I doremember" she said with a shudder. "What a horrible&#xD;
end !"&#xD;
&#xD;

"The story may magnify the horror. The bones however, we&#xD;
found, warrant a shade of truth to it."&#xD;
"But why should later visitors, why should those men we saw&#xD;
there, not have buried the skeleton?"&#xD;
"Perhaps, to terrify uncalled visitors. Let that be, as it may:&#xD;
I am bound, to search for the will, as soon as I am free, to go to&#xD;
the cave.'&#xD;
"When will that be?"&#xD;
"Within one week, just from to  '&#xD;
"Is not the risk you run too great a stake for the possible&#xD;
gain ?"&#xD;
"May be, Dol; but it isn't the gain, that tempts me. There is&#xD;
a mystery concerning our family and as long as that is unrevea-&#xD;
led, I shall have no rest.&#xD;
"I think, I understand you, Charlie and I shall make no further&#xD;
objections, provided you allow me, to satisfy my curiosity at the&#xD;
same time."&#xD;
"There you have got me now, Dol, I declare. It is hardly fair,&#xD;
to set such traps for your friends; but you have the advantage&#xD;
and may as well follow it up. But ain't you afraid to go, child?"&#xD;
We see that Charles carefully preserves old privileges, for the&#xD;
appellation of "child" is hardly applicable to that companion at&#xD;
his side.&#xD;
Dolores shook her head.&#xD;
'I am not afraid, Charlie" she said with a smile, "but I experi-&#xD;
ence the feeling, that used to creep over.me, when a child I list-&#xD;
ened to the fairy tales of old. b If it is a fear, it certainly is clothed&#xD;
into a very attractive garb."&#xD;
The dear girl in -giving this reply evidently did not examine her&#xD;
inner 'self very closely. If she had done so, she might-have found&#xD;
that she was more afraid for her companion, than for herself and&#xD;
being unable to prevent his going, found a comfort in sharing his&#xD;
danger.&#xD;
Therdistance to the mansion was but short and the young&#xD;
couple reached the carriage-gate much sooner than they liked.&#xD;
Not, that this feeling had manifested itself to them in a tangible&#xD;
shape-Dol might have even attempted a denial-but it surely&#xD;
was in existence ; it showed itself in the pressure of their hands,&#xD;
at parting, in the slightly doleful character of the "good night"&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        143&#xD;
and the repeated turning of the head, of which both parties were&#xD;
guilty, although they might as well have omitted it, for all the&#xD;
benefit they derived from it in the dead of the night.&#xD;
Happy young couple! happy, because they are so without&#xD;
knowing it, enjoying, as it were, the rich hour of promise just be-&#xD;
fore the dawn of morning. The sun will soon rise; the glories of&#xD;
his colors will set the skies on fire; his genial heat, his alluring&#xD;
smile will entice all nature into frolicsome gladness. 'he flowers&#xD;
will then open, the bugs will buzz;. a deep, a trembling happiness&#xD;
will penetrate through nature. The earth will heave, and shout&#xD;
in thousand voices the supreme rapture of existence, as if it feared&#xD;
to suffocate of the fulsomeness of life's delight.&#xD;
All this the hour of early morn anticipates and so does the&#xD;
youthful heart foretaste the bliss of love, before the conscious&#xD;
ness of love has even dawned. No constraint has as yet fettered&#xD;
the general intercouse between the youth and maiden; no stam-&#xD;
mering diffidence, no burning blush become the treacherous index&#xD;
of their heart's sensations. Hand in hand they wander over&#xD;
meadows, decked with flowers; their bosoms calm, their faces&#xD;
serene, their steps elastic. But now the heavenly light peeps over&#xD;
the horizon, wrapping the distant mountains in a vail of purple.&#xD;
They stop, to look; they look and wonder; they wonder and an&#xD;
ined sensation, as strange as new, creeps over their hearts,&#xD;
inns along their nerves, shoots through their brain, knocking&#xD;
every where at the secret doors of their existence and caus-&#xD;
ing new life to spring under its footsteps. At once they know&#xD;
and tremble at their knowledge; they shrink from one another's&#xD;
ght and flee each other, merely to unite.  No longer does&#xD;
their laughter's merry peel echo through the woods and on the&#xD;
banks of the rivulets; they grow pale and melancholy, but drink-&#xD;
appiness from     their very sadness; they-in short they&#xD;
love, obeying thus the great eternal law, which called them foth&#xD;
to existence for that purpose. Love! life's essence and con-&#xD;
dition, its in and out, its up and down, its all and everything!&#xD;
Love! the old story, told ever since Adam learned to know the&#xD;
charms of Eve and yet not finished and never to be finished as&#xD;
long as minutes run along the everlasting stream of time.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
A VOICE FROM THE GRAVE.&#xD;
When Charles called on his uncle the next morning for the pa-&#xD;
pers promised, that gentleman was still in bed, snoring away the&#xD;
effects of last night's potations. But Charles declined, to stand&#xD;
on ceremony; he was impatient for the papers and at the same&#xD;
time thought, that his uncle wasn't the man to be approached on&#xD;
tiptoe. So he went up to the bed, and shaking the arm of the&#xD;
sleeper, cried into his ear.&#xD;
"Good morning uncle Jacob. I hope you enjoyed a good&#xD;
night's rest."&#xD;
Oh! ah !" the sleeper groaned, throwing his arms wildly around&#xD;
his head. "Don't take the will, you shan't have the will.&#xD;
"He dreams about it" Charles muttered and giving his uncle&#xD;
a second shaking, tried to, awake him.&#xD;
At last the man opened his eyes, staring at - the youth with a&#xD;
gaze, so vacant, as to lack every vestige of intelligence and re-&#xD;
cognition. However bye and bye he grew more wakeful and rub&#xD;
bing his eyes, said to his nephew:&#xD;
"Ah, Charles, that's you; up and dressed.  Ah, you young&#xD;
folks have the advantage of us. I declare I am as drowsy, as if&#xD;
I hadn't slept an hour. What time is it Charlie?"&#xD;
"Oh it's early enough, uncle. Only I thought I'd wake you&#xD;
in time, to get ready for breakfast."&#xD;
"Thank you my boy; but I don't feel a bit hungry this morning&#xD;
and with your kind permission shall get another nap. Your&#xD;
mother's good things won't run away, youknow."&#xD;
"Just as you please, uncle. Only I would thank you to give&#xD;
me that diary now. I have to go to the factory bye and bye and&#xD;
should like to read before I leave.&#xD;
"Exactly, Charlie. Here take the key and open my carpet-bag.&#xD;
Do you see the bundle of papers! Just take the top one: that's&#xD;
it. I hope you'll enjoy the reading, though I doubt it very much,&#xD;
for to tell you the truth Charlie, it's nothing but woman's gossip&#xD;
and awful dry in the bargain."&#xD;
"I'll try to make the best of it, uncle."&#xD;
"Exactly, Charlie, but stop a moment, if you please. One favor&#xD;
is worth another, you kiow and I may as well state to you inl&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       145&#xD;
confidence, that I am in the habit of regulating my appetite for&#xD;
the day by a little dram in the morning."&#xD;
You want a glass of wine uncle?"&#xD;
"No Charlie, no wine. The best wine has some acidity, which&#xD;
contracts the stomach and prevents it from doing its whole duty.&#xD;
I want something of a stronger nature, something that will shut&#xD;
up the cracks and fissures in my old receptacle and impart a glow&#xD;
of health and vigor to its muscles."&#xD;
"I understand you uncle" Charles replied with a laugh, for he&#xD;
could not help enjoying his uncles pointed way of stating things&#xD;
in spite of his uncouthness. He applied to his mother for' the&#xD;
strongest stomach bitters she had in the house and filling a large&#xD;
tumbler with it, returned to his uncle; who on his arrival at the&#xD;
room had already closed one eye and merely seemed to keep the&#xD;
other open, to report the coming of the dram at headquarters.&#xD;
"Ah, that's a good boy. If the quality equals the quantity I&#xD;
shall hardly have to find fault,"&#xD;
Charles smiled,' when his uncle took the tumbler and in one&#xD;
draft, poured its contents down his throat. The young man could&#xD;
hardly have swallowed a drop without burning his throat and he&#xD;
felt a mischivous pleasure at anticipating his uncles discomfiture.&#xD;
But he had reckoned without the host-not even a mien did that&#xD;
experienced imbiber of alcoholic drinks suffer to get out of shape.&#xD;
"First rate !" he said smacking his lips and sending forth at&#xD;
almost the same instance the first of a number of snores, which&#xD;
at once convinced his nephew ofthe uselessness of further efforts&#xD;
at conversation. The youth was however by no means inclined&#xD;
to waste any time on the old tippler ; but seizing the paper with&#xD;
an eager grasp, left the room, to seek the solitude of his own.&#xD;
Moving a rocking chair to the window, through which the first-&#xD;
rays of the sun proclaimed a golden morning, he prepared to read&#xD;
the effusious of a heart, which had been mouldering in the grave.&#xD;
yard for many, many years. It was with a certain veneration&#xD;
that Charles brought the manuscript to his eye and read:&#xD;
. - - ---.... .. ..Be quiet, heart: what doest thouwish? Hast&#xD;
thou not husband and children-such darling children to dote&#xD;
upon --what doest thou want? Canst thou not quit, to dwell upon&#xD;
a recollection, which is as idle as it is sinful?   ,&#xD;
Alas, thus IO admonish it every day, but in vain. I cannot&#xD;

banish his memory; for the more I try, the more distinctly it rises&#xD;
to my vision. Eberhardt, you have been well avenged, and your&#xD;
sad words of farewell will never cease to echo in my soul. Where&#xD;
are you now? [Jave you finally found a home, to rest your weary&#xD;
foot, a loving voice to comfort you, a caressing hand, to wipe the&#xD;
perspiration from your brow? Alas, it was my province to admin-&#xD;
ister to your wants, my destiny to travel the path of life at your&#xD;
;side-but a strange perversion blinded me as to my fate and now&#xD;
-am I culpable? no, merely miserable, in spite of the many bles-&#xD;
sings of my existence. My husband is good and noble; my&#xD;
children are worthy both of love and pride and yet-what makes&#xD;
mxy life a desert? Is it not the endless, ceaseless, neverdying&#xD;
earning for the man, whom but too late I recognized as the idol&#xD;
.,Of my soul?&#xD;
This is sinful, I know; but I have given it up, to stifle-an emo-&#xD;
tion, which fills my heart to the exclusion of a wife's affection, a&#xD;
mother's love. Sometimes I feel, as if I could no longer bear&#xD;
this suspense; as if I had to tear myself from home and kindred&#xD;
and my native country to hunt his trace all over the world and&#xD;
having found him, die contented at his feet.&#xD;
................I was too cruel when he went. I forbade him&#xD;
to think of me, to write to me. Ah, at that moment I was yet&#xD;
unconscious of the condition of my heart. To-day I have no&#xD;
greater wish, no more ardent desire, than to hear from him, to&#xD;
,know, how he bears the exile to which my madness drove him.&#xD;
................ I have -heard from him. Years have passed&#xD;
since his departure; but every circumstance connected with it, is&#xD;
as vividly impressed on my memory as on the very day, he left us.&#xD;
Poor Eberhardt ! he cannot rest and by his restlessness destroys&#xD;
my peace as well. My heart at least has learned to beat more&#xD;
quietly; but my soul is as much troubled at the exiles destiny as&#xD;
ever it was. If I could only see him enter in heaven, where he&#xD;
might rest from the storms of his life : I think, I could still learn&#xD;
to be happy. My husband's affection is increasing with his years&#xD;
and my children are displaying traits, of which a mother might&#xD;
well be proud. My noble John, who with his father's name seems&#xD;
to have inherited his happy disposition, his equinamity and peace-'&#xD;
fulness of mind. My beautiful Eberhardt, named after the rest-&#xD;
less wanderer and restless to himself. He cannot settle down at&#xD;
any peaceful occupation but always builds up castles in the air.&#xD;
May heaven protect him from his uncle's destiny.&#xD;
. ............... Again a letter, the last one I am likely to re-&#xD;
ceive from him. This awful letter! half curse half blessing.&#xD;
How, after twenty long years of separation, it has once more pro-&#xD;
duced an uproar in my soul, of which I would have thought my-&#xD;
self incapable., Alas ! is this so wonderful? a stranger could not&#xD;
persue these lines, without feeling a shudder creep through his&#xD;

DOLORES.                        147&#xD;
body; much less the person, whom he would like to make account-&#xD;
able for his transgressions. But am I guilty of his sins? Had&#xD;
he a right, to rebel against his God and make his wretchedness&#xD;
an excuse for yielding to his evil passions? No, thank God! I&#xD;
am not guilty. If I misunderstood the feeling of my heart; if&#xD;
in the innocence of unconscious maidenhood I took for love the&#xD;
voice that spoke in me for my husband, his brother John-I suf&#xD;
fered agonies of years and thereby expiated my mistake. But as&#xD;
to guilt--I here deny the charge and call to heaven for a witness&#xD;
of my innocence. But though he wrongs me in his char e I&#xD;
not help crying and trembling at the horrid picture he conjures&#xD;
before my eye. What can lie mean? what do his allusionss&#xD;
ify dOh thiis uncertait, this ambiguity is worse than tes mst&#xD;
horrid detail of his crime's.3&#xD;
lHe talks of gold- how did he earn it? He talks also of l&#xD;
mg it to my .children. I do not want it; they shall not have it&#xD;
for I fear, their is--but no, I cannot write down the word which&#xD;
a fearful suspicion whispers in my ear. Let him kee his old&#xD;
I will pity him, I will pray for him, I will even with gentle hands&#xD;
adnster unto his wants in case he comes to die at home-but&#xD;
-I do not want his money.&#xD;
.... . .. . .He must be dead; I feel it in my heart but&#xD;
who knows in what country he has laid his weary head upon th&#xD;
pillow, never to lift it up again.&#xD;
He must not have returned to Maine or we should have heard&#xD;
from Walter, to whom he had entrusted the stewardship of h&#xD;
estate. Should Walter hesitate to write, because he fears, th&#xD;
we might come and claim a portion of the spoils? Alas the&#xD;
no danger and if he knew my feelings he might write perhaps and&#xD;
let me know. It is hard to bear this suspense.&#xD;
.. ... .......Another year and not a word from him or&#xD;
Walter. I am more fully convinced than ever, that he is dead.&#xD;
he thought troubles me and gives me comfort at the same time.&#xD;
is life was so miserable, that death must have been a blessin-&#xD;
to him. Indeed his letter says so and if I could but fi&#xD;
thoughts upon a spot where his weary body rests, I might pray&#xD;
for him and in my prayer experience a feeling of relief pa&#xD;
..  ............. To-day my son Eberhardt left us, to  o to&#xD;
Italy and study the works of art, which grace the cities of that&#xD;
happy land- He is a great artist and much as my heart aches at&#xD;

has fed her children with the blood of her heart, they leave the&#xD;
parental roof, may be never to return. Eberhardt has found in&#xD;
Rome the maiden of his choice and he requests our sanction to&#xD;
his union with the loved one. What can we do, but consent? and&#xD;
yet to consent means nothing but to sign our son's degree of ex-&#xD;
ile. Once married in Italy he may never return to the land of&#xD;
his fathers.&#xD;
.         .     Joyous news from Italy! Eberhardt's Maria&#xD;
has given birth to a son whom they will name Carlo in honor of&#xD;
his grandmother. Alas! a sad honor it is! for will I ever see&#xD;
again the son of my heart and the dear child that bears my name?&#xD;
.     ......I have become resigned to the prospect of&#xD;
dying without blessing my absent son. The ties that bind him to&#xD;
his second home become stronger every day, aid though lie pro-&#xD;
mises in every letter, that the next year shall witness a journey&#xD;
of his across the Alps-I have my own thoughts about it. Carlo&#xD;
is getting tall and handsome, his father writes and shows a greater&#xD;
talent for his father's art, than that father himself. I hope he&#xD;
will some day be a great artist.&#xD;
...  ... . ...The expectations of Eberhardt regarding&#xD;
Carlo's talents have been more than realized. The young man is&#xD;
only twenty and yet his picture of the crucifixion won the prize&#xD;
at the exhibition. If anything can mitigate the sadness of sep-&#xD;
aration from my dear ones, it is the pride I take in their achieve-&#xD;
ments.&#xD;
m.             I am getting old and feeble and my days are&#xD;

have been many-only-I wish I could see my friends in Italy&#xD;
before I close my eyes in slumber everlasting. I am great grand-&#xD;
mother now, for Carlo has chosen his companion of life and she&#xD;
has born him a daughter. A sweet face is hers;he sent me the&#xD;
picture in miniature and I cannot tire of looking at the soulful&#xD;
face.-&#xD;
face....Aunt Caroline is dead and I have assuned&#xD;
the legacy of her papers. To me' they are dear relics of a womnan,&#xD;
who came as near the angels, as human beings are capable. She&#xD;
suffered much in early life and the perusal of her notes, written&#xD;
in the agony of pain, has deeply affected me. But her strength&#xD;
of mind at last overcame her weakness and the latter part of her&#xD;
life passed in peace and happiness. Poor aunt! if she could but&#xD;
have seen her son Eberhardt, before her death! This was her&#xD;
wish by day and dream at night and her yearninge has no doubt&#xD;
accelerated her dissolution. I think Eberhardt might well have&#xD;
humored the wishes of his mother; but then, she would not le&#xD;

of his own accord she used to say-my foolish prayer shall never&#xD;
bring him. So she died and only an hour afterwards the sad news&#xD;
of Eberhardt's death arrived. It was well she died beforehand,&#xD;
for if not, the letter would have killed her with a shock.&#xD;
 .                                          ......... .....A  number of years have passed without&#xD;
my touching these papers. Now I have to chronicle a number&#xD;
of changes. Carlo has risen to great fame in Italy; his daughter&#xD;
Maria is wooed by one of the country's princes, the duke di Ga-&#xD;
tana........&#xD;
Further than this Charles could not read. The last name acted&#xD;
on his feelings pretty much the same way, as the lighted match&#xD;
on a keg of powder. It exploded him to such a degree, that he&#xD;
had to collect himself considerably before he was able to reflect.&#xD;
A film over his eye prevented him from seeing and he had to&#xD;
wipe them before they were capable of exercising their functions.&#xD;
At last when his power of vision returned, he hunted the place a&#xD;
second time and-there it stood in plain letters: Duke di Gatana.&#xD;
Could it be possible ? If a woman of his house had married the&#xD;
Duke of Gatana-why, then-&#xD;
He stopped thinking, to resume a reading, which had proved so&#xD;
fascinating.&#xD;
. "''............The report was true enough; two months ago&#xD;
the wedding was celebrated with great splendor and Maria Fuchs&#xD;
the painter's daughter, followed her noble husband to his princely&#xD;
domains in Lombardy.&#xD;
. - -.-M- - .... ....fary has written to me, the dear child. She&#xD;
pretends to be perfectly happy and yet I feel a shadow of sadness&#xD;
in her letter. They have been married now these five years and&#xD;
yet no children have blessd their union. Perhaps the sadness or-&#xD;
iginates from this. Indeed there is no perfect happiness beneath&#xD;
the skies.&#xD;
...            .At last!  An heiress has made her appear-&#xD;
ai e i the ducal palace and time vein of sadness has disappeared&#xD;
from Maria's letters. May the sun of bliss shine  ee for ever on the&#xD;
worthy couple.&#xD;
..   ...........In reading over the above wish I am struck&#xD;
with the fickleness of fortune. Alas. I am old and decrepid!&#xD;
Why could I not depart without seeing the loved ones in Italy&#xD;
come to want and sorrow. Caroline died before the news of Fber-&#xD;
hardt's death reached her-her niece is much less fortunate, for she&#xD;
has to chronicle a destiny much worse than death. This terrible&#xD;
political convulsions! If the duke had only taken Maria,s warn-&#xD;

even his life and by assisting in an effort to restore its liberty put&#xD;
both at stake. Fortune did not smile on his undertaking and&#xD;
now the duke and his family wander as fugitives in a distant&#xD;
land across the ocean. To us they could not come. Austria's&#xD;
mighty hand would have reached the duke and then--what should&#xD;
they have done here but mourn the downfall of a family once&#xD;
rich and respected? Our house has sunk! Instead of the riches&#xD;
of uncle Eberhardt, who died in foreign lands, the children of&#xD;
Caroline seem to have inherited the evil seed springing from&#xD;
the curses of his letter..Conrad her grandson has gone to America&#xD;
and Jacob his brother by his vagaries is doing his best, to drag&#xD;
the gray hair of his poor aunt with sorrow into the grave. Oh!&#xD;
I am weary! Welcome death, how long wilt thou tarry to lead ne&#xD;
through thy gates into the regions, where all the friends of early&#xD;
days are dwelling. Come! oh come! to relieve me.&#xD;
With this the manuscript closed; but Charles continued to gaze&#xD;
at it, as if he could not free himself fron the influence 'of the&#xD;
spirits, that seemed to breathe at him from the lines. He pon-&#xD;
dered on the sad fate of both the writers on the decline of a fam-&#xD;
ily, once rich and influental. He meditated on the strange fate,&#xD;
that scattered its members here and there following their wander-&#xD;
ings in his mind, visited the famous cities of Italy. Then all at&#xD;
once the name of the duke, who married Carlo's daughter came&#xD;
back to his memory and from that name it skipped unto the fair&#xD;
companion of last night's walk. Dolores his kin, his dear, dear&#xD;
cousin!&#xD;
The thought was too exciting to suffer him in his room any.&#xD;
longer. Seizing his hat and putting the manuscript into his&#xD;
pocket, he rushed down stairs, to cross the hall and run through&#xD;
the open housedoor and gate into the street. In vain his won d r-&#xD;
ing mother cried to him, that breakfast was ready and that e&#xD;
should not leave just then. Beckoning to her with a waving laid&#xD;
he ran rather than walked towards the mansion. Never yet had&#xD;
he traversed the distance in so short a time and when lie pushed&#xD;
back the gate, he was a good deal out of breath, partly from ex-&#xD;
citement, partly from the exertion of the run. He stopped to re-&#xD;
cover himself and also to think about the next step he was going&#xD;
to take. It was quite early yet, between the hours of seven and&#xD;
eight and what would .the servants say about so early a call? le&#xD;
felt somewhat like the hero of Cervantes and might have retraced&#xD;
his steps to ,await a fitter hour, if fortunately the door of the&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       15&#xD;
house had not opened at that moment, to admit to the porch the&#xD;
lithe figure of the girl he was in search of. This induced him to&#xD;
remain. He let her come down the stairs and wander a while on&#xD;
the paths of the park; before he stepped up to her and made his&#xD;
presence known. Dolores started at his call ,and seemed to&#xD;
wonder much at his appearance at that hour. She was on the&#xD;
point of asking him the reason; but a glance in his beaming eyes&#xD;
convinced her, that something unusal had occured. So she in-&#xD;
quired at once:&#xD;
"What is it Charlie? What else have you discovered?"&#xD;
"So you think that I have discovered something else, Dol?"&#xD;
I judge it from your excited manners and the unusual hour of&#xD;
your visit."&#xD;
He did not reply at once but taking her hand led her to a seat;&#xD;
the very same seat, where Mr. Fox had adopted her and promised&#xD;
to take the lonely wanderer to his heart. She had told Charles&#xD;
about that place and hour, but they were both too much excited&#xD;
then, to think of it, he in in the eagerness of communicating his&#xD;
discovery, she in the great suspense of waiting for his words.&#xD;
"Set down Dolores" he resumed, pulling the faded manuscript&#xD;
from his pocket and holding it up to her gaze. "Do you see these&#xD;
papers?"&#xD;
"The will of Eberhardt !" she exclaimed clasping her hands&#xD;
and rising to her feet.&#xD;
,"No, not exactly !" he said with a mysterious smile "it is a&#xD;
will, though not the one my uncle hunts so eagerly. The gift, it&#xD;
bestows upon our family, is much more precious, than gold or&#xD;
precious stones."&#xD;
"Dont teaze me, Charlie, but tell me, what you mean. Dont,&#xD;
you see, that I am dying with suspense?"&#xD;
He pressed her back upon the bench and laid the'inanuscript&#xD;
into her hands.&#xD;
"Read' Dol, just read !" he said. But no sooner had she laid&#xD;
eyes upon the paper, when lie snatched it from her again and in&#xD;
a jubilant voice exclaimed :&#xD;
"No! dont read it Dol! dont read it or I shall in the mean time&#xD;
get crazy. You want to know what treasure has been left to us?&#xD;
Well listen: it is the best dearest, prettiest, little cousin in the&#xD;

&#xD;
world and that cousin's name is Dolores di Gatana. Does my&#xD;
little lady now understand, does she still wonder that Charlie&#xD;
Fuchs got tipsy over the news and doesn't know, what he is&#xD;
about?",&#xD;
During these words he had seized both hands of the girl and&#xD;
pulling her up, lifted her into his arms, whirling her around and&#xD;
stealing kiss after kiss from her rosy lips. But this was really to&#xD;
much for her. For the first time she tried to get angry at her&#xD;
friend; and attempting a genuine frown, endeavored to disengage:&#xD;
herself from his embrace.&#xD;
"Charlie !" she said with pouting lips, "have you kept company&#xD;
with your uncle in his attempts upon your father's cellar? I&#xD;
never saw you so before and cannot say, I like it very much.&#xD;
Please sober down and speak coherently, or I must refuse to lis-&#xD;
ten to your queer expressions."&#xD;
Her attempt at indignation merely increased Charlie's mirth,&#xD;
Seizing her hand a second time in spite of her opposition and&#xD;
then holding it a captive between both of his he said:&#xD;
"I told you Dol, that I am tipsy; tipsy with joy, though not&#xD;
with wine. Is it to be wondered that a young man loses his bal-&#xD;
ance of mind, when such a dear sweet cousin falls unexpectedly&#xD;
to his lot?"&#xD;
"But I am at a loss to comprehend your meaning. You found&#xD;
a cousin you say, and that cousin ...."&#xD;
"Is nobody, but my good and loving Dol, my mate, my friend,&#xD;
my fellow student, my everything. Here, read this diary; read&#xD;
it I say, or you might berate me a second time and thereby ex-&#xD;
haust my patience. You know I can stand much... "7&#xD;
"Yes- very much" she said ironically, and then taking the paper&#xD;
made a second attempt, to read the cause of Charlie's unusal&#xD;
merriment..&#xD;
"Not from the beginning !" he cried "it takes too long, to read&#xD;
it all at present. Here let me show you; dont you see: Carlo-&#xD;
that is Carlo Fuchs, the painter-has risen to great fame in Italy;&#xD;
his daughter Maria is wooed by one of the country's princes, the&#xD;
duke di Gatana.'2&#xD;
"My father !" she exclaimed with glowing cheeks.&#xD;
"Of course your father. Here- you.can read how you were&#xD;
&#xD;
'DOLORES.                      153&#xD;
born and how your father lost rank and wealth in' his rash at-&#xD;
tempt to liberate his country."&#xD;
"Why it is true, Charlie ; it is true ! and I am not without re-&#xD;
lations then; besides my good and noble foster-father. I have&#xD;
real kindred and you Charlie, are my cousins you my cousin?"&#xD;
"Ah, who is tipsy now? he inquired with a-laugh, "Madam, I&#xD;
fear you have kept my uncle company in his'attempts upon my&#xD;
father's cellar. Please sober down and speak coherently or- ."-"''&#xD;
She, interrupted him.&#xD;
"Stop, Charlie, stop or I shall cry presently, and that too with-&#xD;
out knowing whether it is with joy or sadness. Have pity upon&#xD;
my dizzy head, Charlie."&#xD;
"I will Dol, on one condition- You must come this very mo-&#xD;
nent and help me break the happy news to my mother."&#xD;
"But Charlie father will soon be up and miss me."&#xD;
"We won't be long."&#xD;
"And may I tell him too?"&#xD;
"Of course Dol, though with a caution. I do not know, how&#xD;
he would receive his new relations?"'&#xD;
"Why yes, I am his kin as well as yours! Oh how this makes&#xD;
ine happy ! to know that it-was after all the voice of nature, that&#xD;
spoke in him for the little stranger; to know that I had real&#xD;
claims upon his love and protection!"&#xD;
She would perhaps have gone on with her exclamations, if he&#xD;
had not stopped her, reminding her of the necessity of speed. So&#xD;
she started leaning on his arm with double resignation or rather-&#xD;
less restraint; for I doubt very much, whether the discovery of&#xD;
their relationship had had the effect of increasing her affection&#xD;
for the youth. She liked him well enough before, I venture to&#xD;
suggest; only the natural diffidence of maidenhood prevented the&#xD;
open manifestation of her feelings. Now he was her cousin and&#xD;
to love a cousin is not only proper, but our bounden duty you&#xD;
know. She may without great impropriety press his arm-es-&#xD;
pecially if he falls as suddenly from the sky, as this one had done&#xD;
-she may without reserve rest her slender form on his support-&#xD;
ing arm; she may even smile on him and turn her head and look&#xD;
so lovingly into his eyes. Is that not the fashion with cousins ?&#xD;
She thinks it is and she is bound to use a privilege so new and&#xD;
50 delightful. Now they approach the cottage. Thef walk no&#xD;

&#xD;
longer; they fairly run and fluttering into the house like two gay&#xD;
butterflies, surprise the family at breakfast. Dolores flies into&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs' arms and kisses her until she pants for breath and&#xD;
Charles shakes his uncle's shoulder's until that worthy cries for&#xD;
mercy and asks for something strong, to steady debilitated nerves.&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs and Henry in their amazement lay down their knives&#xD;
and forks, gazing with open mouths at the intruders and forget-&#xD;
ting to swallow the inorsels, they had entered for promotion.&#xD;
And finally the new comers attempt an explanation; but by their&#xD;
exclamations and mutual interruptions and interpersed caresses&#xD;
make matters rather worse than better. It takes a good while,&#xD;
until the truth dawns upon the company;, but that point once&#xD;
reached, the delight of all of them surpasses even their previous&#xD;
bewilderment.   Even Henry betrays signs of satisfaction and&#xD;
uncle Jacob, striking the table with his fist, so as to make the&#xD;
dishes rattle, exclaims:&#xD;
"iol mich der Kukuk! The deuce may take me, if I didn't&#xD;
kiiow it yesterday. I have her grand-mother's likeness and when&#xD;
you see it you will say, that it resembles her, like one egg does&#xD;
the other."&#xD;
"Yes, you did, uncle; but I claim the exclusive merit of this&#xD;
discovery," Charles now remarked. "Without my literary incli-&#xD;
nation and passion for old manuscripts we might have groped in&#xD;
the dark for years to come. Therefore Dol is my cousin "per&#xD;
excellence" and the rest of you come after me."&#xD;
They all laughed and were just ready to settle down a little and&#xD;
enjoy the presence of the newly found relative; but Dolores&#xD;
would not consent to stay. She had only promised to remain a&#xD;
minute she said and must surely go, to see Mr. Fox and make&#xD;
him a participant in the glad tidings. To this however uncle&#xD;
Jacob objected.&#xD;
"I have your promise, to keep my secret" he admonished her.&#xD;
"Nor shall I violate my promise ; for in stating my relation-&#xD;
ship to him, I need not in the least allude to your secret."&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Fuchs looked rather dubious.&#xD;
"Dolores" the latter said "I have no doubt, that Mr. Fox will&#xD;
rejoice at the fact, that his dear foster-daughter is also his niece;&#xD;
but I am not quite so sure, whether he will be over anxious to re-&#xD;
ceive us all in the capacity of kin."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       155&#xD;
"I know he will" Dolores replied with beaming eyes "and by&#xD;
your doubt you wrong my good foster-father."&#xD;
"May be I do, Dol; but I am almost certain, that Mrs. Fox will&#xD;
see the matter in a different light and I fear, that instead of mend-&#xD;
ing your position in the family, your communication will only&#xD;
serve to make it worse."&#xD;
The countenance of Dolores became sad and pensive.  She&#xD;
studied a minute but after that resumed her former cheerfulness.&#xD;
'You may be right, aunt" she said-she had always called Mrs.&#xD;
Fuchs aunt; so the discovery did not alter the address-and [&#xD;
have resolved, to leave it to Mr. Fox. I consider it my duty, to&#xD;
communicate the news to him and he may then proceed, as he&#xD;
thinks best. Indeed it would make me miserable, to know I held&#xD;
concealed from him a matter of such importance."&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
NEWS BROUGHT HOME.&#xD;
She bid them good bye, as if she feared to meet with more ob-&#xD;
jections. Charlie's company was also refused and alone she re-&#xD;
turned to her father's house. She found him in the garden, where&#xD;
he enjoyed his regular walk before breakfast. He nodded when&#xD;
he saw her passing through the gate.&#xD;
"Been out so early, Dol?" lie inquired.&#xD;
She nodded and folding her hands above his arm and keeping&#xD;
step with him, replied:&#xD;
"I have been out like the princesses of old, while the dew was&#xD;
on the grass and the elfs were playing on the flowers. I have&#xD;
seen them pa and they have told me wonderful tales more wond-&#xD;
erful than any fairytale, my mother used to tell me."&#xD;
"And may I know these wonderful tales, Dol?"&#xD;
"Certainly, pa; that's what I came to see you for. A dutiful&#xD;
daughter ought to have no secrets before her father."&#xD;
"Spin away, then, at your yarn, Doll; the breakfast-bell will&#xD;
ring in less than 15 minutes."&#xD;
"I will, pa, but you must not interrupt me, or I may get con-&#xD;
fused ."&#xD;

156                 DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I'll try, not to, Doll."&#xD;
"So listen then. Once upon a time there was a worthy burgher&#xD;
in the land across the sea, iho had acompetence and some to&#xD;
spare. His good wife bore him three sons, who were alike in&#xD;
beauty and grace of person,but different in disposition. While&#xD;
the oldest was quiet and sedatary in his habits, the youiest dis-&#xD;
played a restlessness and roving spirit, which filled his mother's&#xD;
heart with apprehension. The second brother was neither quiet&#xD;
like the oldest, nor wild and restless like the youngest; but par-&#xD;
taking a little of them both formed as' it were a mediating link&#xD;
between them.&#xD;
Now it happened, that in the neighbour's house a maiden of&#xD;
great beauty held her court. She was not one of noble birth,&#xD;
but also a burgher's daughter; still many noble lords apppeared,&#xD;
to do her homage. However, she listened not to their insinuations,&#xD;
but following the dictates of her parents and-as she thought-&#xD;
of her own heart, she reached her hand in marriage to the burgher's&#xD;
oldest son. The wedding was celebrated with great joy and ex-&#xD;
ultation and the noise for a while deadened the cry of despair&#xD;
which, issued from the youngest brother's mouth. He also loved&#xD;
the handsome maiden; but battling with a diffidence 'so foreign&#xD;
to his free and open nature, had never ventured to betray his&#xD;
passion, till it was too late. Only when a bride, the lady learned&#xD;
the nature of his feelings towards her and frowning on the man&#xD;
that would destroy her peace, she bade him, never to repeat to&#xD;
her words of such improper import. He left- her presence with&#xD;
a curse upon his lips and yielding to the dictates of his fiery na-&#xD;
ture fled from his native home, never to return, but to die an ex..&#xD;
ile in a foreign land. The lady sympathized with his bereaved&#xD;
parents and mourning with the mourners allowed a voice to&#xD;
awake in her heart, which at first she construed as the offspring'&#xD;
of pity. But the voice grew louder every day and when at last&#xD;
it filled her bosom with stifled yearning for the fugitive, she&#xD;
made the terrible discovery, that she had committed a sad mis-&#xD;
take in chosing the oldest brother for her husband. She suffer-&#xD;
ed long and painfully; but like a dutiful wife struggled and bat-&#xD;
tled against her rebellious heart, until at last she had conquered&#xD;
back the peace of former days.&#xD;
Of the fugitive she heard but rarely. The'second brother had&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        157&#xD;
gone to meet him in the wilderness of the new world, where for-&#xD;
tune had heaped her choicest gifts upon the homeless wanderer,.&#xD;
as if to compensate him for his first and fatal disappointment.&#xD;
She would have liked to see him again, yet she consoled her-&#xD;
self until her oldest son in imitation of his uncle, also deserted&#xD;
his native town and crossing the Alps, ,settled in the fair land of&#xD;
Italy. There his name. became noted amongst the famous and&#xD;
skilled in art and his son achieved even a greater reputation than&#xD;
his father. Princes vied to do him homage and one of them&#xD;
sought and received in marriage the hand of the daughter of the&#xD;
house. He took her to his princely dominions and prepared for&#xD;
her the life of one that knows no sorrow, until all at once black&#xD;
clouds arose in the distant sky, a fearful tempest broke loose&#xD;
over their devoted heads. It swept away every trace of wealth&#xD;
and comfort and finally landed them a pair of beggars on the&#xD;
shores of .the new world. The name of that unfortunate noble-&#xD;
man was di Gatana."&#xD;
"Aix Doll, I comprehend ; you are...."&#xD;
"No interruption pa! I have your promise."&#xD;
" Exactly, child, go on then, Doll, go on!"&#xD;
am proceeding pa. Let us return to the roving lover and&#xD;
his brother, in order not to lose sight of them. The latter was&#xD;
put as steward on the wretched man's estate, while the owner&#xD;
hastened from one country to another, as if the furies were al-&#xD;
lowing him no rest. Fearful tales were told about his occupa-&#xD;
tion and pursuit and even now these legends live in the mouth&#xD;
of the people on the coast."&#xD;
"I see, Dol, you have heard the silly story; but...."&#xD;
"Your promise, pa! We shall not quarrel on the merits of the&#xD;
tale; but rather turn our eye upon the brother, who, in conse-&#xD;
quence of the happy combinations of his traits of character,&#xD;
strove and labored and came out victorious in his struggle with&#xD;
the world. Changing his name of Fuchs into that of Fox, he&#xD;
rose in wealth and consideration and became the founder of a&#xD;
family, whose name has ever had clear wooing throughout the&#xD;
state of Maine. His descendents were all worthy men ; but none&#xD;
of them reached in goodness, cleverness and kindness of heart,&#xD;
the present patriarch of Foxvile, my good, my precious father."&#xD;
It had cost Mr. Fox much exertion, to listen to that ; but fin-&#xD;

ished or not finished he was bound not to let the story proceed,&#xD;
without throwing in a word himself. Stopping short' and hold-&#xD;
ing Dolores at arms' length before his eyes, as if he wanted to&#xD;
get a good look at her, he cried:&#xD;
"Now, Miss, that's more than enough. Promise or no pro-&#xD;
mise, I mean to have my saying too. Does the vixen know, that&#xD;
she completely confused my head with her long stories ? I kind&#xD;
of guess the meaning of that gossip and yet I must confess I&#xD;
hardly know....&#xD;
He looked so comical with his dubious"countenance, that Dol-&#xD;
ores could uot help laughing.&#xD;
"Let me perform the task of solving the mystery for you, pa,"&#xD;
she said. "I'll state it in the simple form of a mathematical pro-&#xD;
blem. Now pa, do pay attention: when two brothers have child-_&#xD;
ren, what relation do the latter sustain to one another?"&#xD;
" Why that of cousins, of course, yon vixen."&#xD;
"And the childrens' children ?"&#xD;
"Are cousins still, though in the second degree."&#xD;
"And their children again ?"&#xD;
"Cousins, Dol, nothing but cousins in a homeopathic fashion."&#xD;
"Then, worthy Sir, allow me to present to your consideration,&#xD;
your cousin Dolores di Gatana."&#xD;
A moment he stared at her. Then nodding eagerly.he dried:&#xD;
"That is the kernel of the nut;.indeed it is. And so my good,&#xD;
my darling daughter has all at once become a distant cousin in&#xD;
the fourth degree. Dol, I protest against that change."&#xD;
His voice showed a queer mixture of joy and sadness and it is&#xD;
likely, that he merely spoke at random, to prevent himself from,&#xD;
falling a victim of the deep emotion, which had seized him. But&#xD;
Dolores took it differently. Her excited mind had merely heard&#xD;
the melancholy touch in her companion's voice and throwing her-&#xD;
self into his arms with an unexpected vehemence, that almost&#xD;
made him stagger, she said:&#xD;
"No pa, there must not be a change from that. I want to re-&#xD;
main your loving dutiful daughter. Yet I can hardly tell, how&#xD;
much I was delighted, to know, that you and I are kin; for it ex-&#xD;
plains to me, why you and I were drawn together from the start.&#xD;
Moreover it lightens a little the burden, under which a consci-&#xD;
ousness of endless obligation to my benefactor made me stagger.&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       159&#xD;
I am your cousin now, you see and cousins have a legal claim of&#xD;
mutual protection."&#xD;
"I see from your face, that you are joking Dol; else I might&#xD;
feel inclined to lecture you the first time since our connection.&#xD;
You speak of obligation, while in reality I am your everlasting&#xD;
debtor for all the rays of happiness, which ever since have lit my&#xD;
loneliness and sadness."&#xD;
"Well, ,pa, I say nothing more; let us exchange receipted bills&#xD;
and then commence a new account."&#xD;
"Agreed Dol, but there is the breakfast-bell. Come let us rap-&#xD;
idly inform our sovereign Lady. I ain very curious to know, how&#xD;
she receives the news and whether it-will make the flowers spring.&#xD;
up within her frosty heart."&#xD;
Dolores started.&#xD;
"Pa" she suddenly cried, stopping him short. "Your words&#xD;
remind Inc of the fact, that you interrupted my story and that I&#xD;
never finished it."&#xD;
"True Dol, but I know, the most important part, and can wait&#xD;
for the end till after breakfast."&#xD;
The most important, pa? Iow do you know that? Indeed I&#xD;
must detain you even at the risk, of letting the coffee get cold."&#xD;
"Well child, hurry then. I have spoiled you, I know and you&#xD;
must have your way."&#xD;
"Exactly pa; I '11 not engage you longer than a minute. The&#xD;
lady had another son, besides the one, that went to Italy, He&#xD;
stayed at home and marrying a maiden of his native, town, raised&#xD;
a family and struggled to maintain the ancient glory of the house.&#xD;
But it was all in vain, the means and the influence of the family&#xD;
dwindled from generation to generation and at last the old home-&#xD;
stead had to be sold. Before this happened, one of the two&#xD;
brother's, representing the family at present, in consequence of a&#xD;
quarrel stirred by his younger brother; left his native town and&#xD;
turning his steps towards the great republic of the West, settled&#xD;
in the little town of Foxville. There....&#xD;
"But Dol that goes beyond the bounds of reality. Your story&#xD;
is more romantic than the wildest fairytale .. ."&#xD;
Mr. Fox said this with more excitement than he had even I&#xD;
manifested at the first discovery, and that is easily explained. A&#xD;
man is more exposed to the danger of intoxication at the second&#xD;

bottle than the first one and Dolores construed her father's ex-&#xD;
citement in that way.&#xD;
"That is not my fault, pa", she said shrugging her shoulders&#xD;
and dragging him towards the house "but you haven't told me&#xD;
yet, what you think about the other relations."&#xD;
"Relations, yes relations" Mr. Fox exclaimed allowing his head&#xD;
to rise and fall in regular intervals. They are all my relations&#xD;
and glad am I of it, of course, for honester people than they&#xD;
aint to be found in the United States."&#xD;
"There! I thought so !" Dol exclaimed, her face bearing an&#xD;
expression of triumph.&#xD;
"What, Dol?"&#xD;
"That you would'nt hesitate to acknowledge our good friends&#xD;
as your k in."i&#xD;
"Ofcourse I don't, Dol; you did me but justice in that Sul)-&#xD;
position."&#xD;
"But Mrs. Fuehs had one too, pa. She thinks Mrs. Fox&#xD;
would'nt be quite so delighted at the change as I."&#xD;
His countenance became thoughtful.&#xD;
"She may be right, Dol," he said with a nod, "but .that cannot&#xD;
alter my part in the programme. I am bound to inform my fam-&#xD;
ily of their new acquisitions and the sooner they receive the in-&#xD;
formation, the better it will be. But, child, oncmore question,&#xD;
before we enter. Where did you all at once collect so much in&#xD;
formations. Did you turn somnambulist or establish e regular&#xD;
telegraph line with beings from a higher sphere?"&#xD;
"Not at all, pa. My channel is rather duty and commonplace.&#xD;
A brother of our Mr. Fuchs suddenly last night made his appear-&#xD;
ance at his brother's door and after eating and drinking like a&#xD;
hero, announced himself as Mr. Jacob Fuchs beyond the sea the&#xD;
knight without much fear but not without much love of anything&#xD;
that can administer unto the wants of the stomach. ..."&#xD;
"A brother of Mr. Fuchs, you say? Why, wonder over wonder!&#xD;
If this week continues, as it has commenced, it will surely become&#xD;
the most momentuous one of my life."&#xD;
Is Saul amongst the prophets? Poor Mr. Fox! .Does an i-&#xD;
ward voice whisper to you of coming evils? Does the traitor's&#xD;
wicked purpose throw its shadow ahead upon your path?&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       161&#xD;
Without further remarks they stepped into the house. Mrs.&#xD;
Fox and the children were already engaged at their meal.&#xD;
"Caroline, you must excuse our tardiness" Mr. Fox addressed&#xD;
his wife, "on account of very strange discoveries I have made.&#xD;
I would ask you to guess their nature, if I were not convinced&#xD;
beforehand, that you would never find out."&#xD;
A guilty conscience is easily alarmed. Mrs. Fox was conceal-&#xD;
ing things from her husband and the thought that her conduct&#xD;
was very natural. She grew pale and even had to eize the table&#xD;
for support. Mr. Fox observed her confusion. He nodded&#xD;
pleasantly and said:&#xD;
"Well, Caroline, you seem to have an idea after all. You get&#xD;
excited, I notice, and well you may, for I did not fare any better."&#xD;
She trembled worse than before, but her lips remained closed.&#xD;
"Why, what is the matter, Madame." Fox inquired, "you sure-&#xD;
ly are getting nervous. I never knew that you took so much in-&#xD;
terest in Dolores,"&#xD;
"Dolores."  Mrs. Fox breathed more freely. Then her h us.&#xD;
band did not allude to her, and yet she had nearly betrayed her-&#xD;
self. For a moment she hated the girl as much as ever.&#xD;
"Dolores," she gasped, betraying in her features the nature of&#xD;
her feelings. "What of her? I expected from your excited mien,&#xD;
that some accident, indeed I hardly know....I thought...."&#xD;
"No, no, Caroline," he answered more softly than he had been&#xD;
wont to speak to her lately. "Rest easy as to that. I do not&#xD;

one? We are all present excepting Dick and he ."&#xD;
Mr Fox left the sentence unfinished; but his face revealed the&#xD;
thought, which his lips had refused  to communicate.  His&#xD;
brow became clouded and his lips compressed, thereby bestowing&#xD;
upon his face the expression of energy and decision, which we&#xD;
generally missed in it.&#xD;
If Mr. Fox expected to be interrogated by his wife, he was mis-&#xD;
taken. She had learned that her husband's discoveries did not&#xD;
relate to her, but to the girl, whom at best, she had regarded&#xD;
with indifference, she abstained from all further manifestations&#xD;
of ' uriosity.&#xD;
Not so Lucy. We have much neglected that young lady ii our&#xD;
or. She also had grown and developed; but their had beein&#xD;

hardly any change in the character of her appearance. There&#xD;
were the same gentle features, the same blue eyes and   yellow&#xD;
curls. The bloom on lips and cheeks had deepened, and her form&#xD;
was approaching the embonpoint, which even her childhood had&#xD;
predicted and which ceases to be a virtue, as soon as it passes a&#xD;
certain limit. This limit Lucy had not reached; she still moved&#xD;
with grace and ease, embodying the idea of what is called a&#xD;
"sweet girl". She now was curious to know the news of her&#xD;
father, because they concerned her friend Dolores. Ever since&#xD;
her mother had ceased to restrict the intercourse of the girls, a&#xD;
fast friendship had sprung up between them, in spite of the dif-&#xD;
ference of their character and intellect. While Dolores with her&#xD;
keen penetration and energy formed the positive pole, Lucy, with&#xD;
her gentle and yielding disposition, supplied the negative. She&#xD;
moved as it were planet-like around her sun, receiving from it&#xD;
light and warmth. Still, unlike the relation between sun and&#xD;
earth, that of the girl showed no seasons. There was no heat, no&#xD;
drought, no icy coldness; but the current of their friendship ran&#xD;
on with even tenor. Lucy not only loved Dolores; she also look-&#xD;
ed up to her; she respected, admired and even worshipped her,&#xD;
and anything concerning her idol was of course received with&#xD;
lively interest. So taking up her father's interrupted sentence,&#xD;
she said:&#xD;
"And he, is not likely to meet with accidents. Like a cat he&#xD;
always lights upon his feet in case of a fall."&#xD;
"You don't flatter your brother," Mrs. Fox said with a touch&#xD;
of displeasure.&#xD;
"Nor is that at all necessary," Mr. Fox suggested speaking rap-&#xD;
idly. "If he had been flattered less, he would fare better now&#xD;
than he does."&#xD;
Lucy saw the danger of an altercation. To avoid it, she ex-&#xD;
claimed:&#xD;
"But the news, father, the news! It is hardly fair to hold them&#xD;
out in prospect, and then refuse to make them known."&#xD;
"True, child," Mr. Fox exclaimed, his face brightening with&#xD;
the recollection of Dol's communications. "I am in duty bound,&#xD;
to let the cat out of the bag."&#xD;
"But I don't want a cat, father; you know I don't like cats."&#xD;
"But supposing, I substitute a cousin for the cat?"&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
163&#xD;
&#xD;
"A cousin, pa: what do you mean?"&#xD;
"A bran new cousin, child, and what a cousin."&#xD;
"Wouldn't yon like to have a cousin Lucy?"&#xD;
"Why yes, I would ; but that is an idle wish, for it will never&#xD;
be realized and I am still at a loss, to comprehend, what you are&#xD;
driving at."&#xD;
"Well, Lucy didn't I tell you plainly, that I have found a&#xD;
cousin for you? How would you fancy Dol for one?"&#xD;
"I should be delighted with her, pa."&#xD;
"Well take her then; she is your-cousin. Caroline what do&#xD;
you think?. The foster-daughter, who entered our house a stranger&#xD;
to shed light and sunshine over it, has turned out a relative, a real&#xD;
relative."&#xD;
"Pa, you are joking," Lucy answered for her mother.&#xD;
"No indeed, I am in dead earnest. Her mother descends from&#xD;
a brother of our ancestor. She is a cousin in good faith, though&#xD;
not in the first degree."&#xD;
Lucy was delighted. She rose and embraced her new relation&#xD;
and kissing her tenderly, exclaimed:&#xD;
"Oh, I am so glad, I have a cousin, a real life cousin and better&#xD;
still, I have my Dol for one."&#xD;
Dolores smiled.&#xD;
"I don't know whether I ought to feel flattered or not," she&#xD;
said. "You seem very willing, to renounce the sister,just to gain&#xD;
a distant cousin."&#xD;
"Dol. shame on you" she cried "you know I didn't mean it&#xD;
that way. I love you doubly now, once as a sister and secondly&#xD;
as a cousin. Indeed I shall have my heart so full of you, that I&#xD;
must build an addition to,"&#xD;
While the girls laughed at this remark, Mrs. Fox inquired:&#xD;
"That is quite a romance, Sir: may I ask you where you got&#xD;
the material for the plot?".&#xD;
"Yes. madam' he replied somewhat vexed at her derisive tone&#xD;
'you can be furnished with the source as well as with the proof.&#xD;
It does exist in writings of the most conclusive character, and&#xD;
since you seem to be so much delighted at this acquisition, [reel&#xD;
inclined to intimate, that there is a certain prospect of a further&#xD;
increase of our stock."&#xD;
"How fortunate for you, that claims to be a philanthropist.&#xD;

We on the other hand will suffer from the access, since by a&#xD;
simple rule of arithmetic the quotient is reduced in just propor-&#xD;
tion to the increase of the divisor."&#xD;
"No danger madam, the heart is like the magnet; the greater&#xD;
the weight it carries, the greater also its strength. But ain't you&#xD;
anxious to learn the other names ?"&#xD;
"Ladies are decried as being curious; a denial on my part would&#xD;
therefore awail me nothing."&#xD;
"That,s what I call an unconditional surrender. Now, if I tell&#xD;
you, that the family name of Dol's mother was Fuchs, can you&#xD;
guess the balance?"&#xD;
Mrs. Fox started.&#xD;
"Edward" she said with dignity "if you confine your joke to&#xD;
Dolores, it can be borne, because. it does not alter facts; but if&#xD;
you go beyond this and threaten to draw your factory hands into&#xD;
the family circle, I must decidedly object."&#xD;
I shall draw nobody in, that has no business there, Caroline;&#xD;
but you don't expect me to be able to undo established facts."&#xD;
'"And these facts: will you have the kindness to enlighten me&#xD;
as to their nature?"&#xD;
"Of course I will" Mr. Fox replied and then proceeded to state&#xD;
briefly the history of. the family, from which his own had sprung.&#xD;
Mrs. Fox could not help being impressed with the correctness of&#xD;
the statements; but yet her aristocratic mind rebelled against the&#xD;
thought of receiving on terms of intimacy a family, who thus far&#xD;
had been counted amongst the hands employed by her husband&#xD;
in his factory.&#xD;
"And what-what does Mr. Fuchs think of this?" she inquired&#xD;
addressing herself to the girl, who had also had the presumption&#xD;
of pressing her claims upon her delicately organized mind..&#xD;
"He was loth to have me tell Mr. Fox at all." Dolores replied&#xD;
with emphasis.&#xD;
"And why did you see fit, to disobey his wishes?"&#xD;
"Because I felt unwilling to keep, so important a matter from&#xD;
his knowledge. Fear nothing however, madam; if you take no&#xD;
measures to open connections with the family they on their part,&#xD;
will be very slow, to encroach on you."&#xD;
"That shows, that Mlr. Fuchs and his wife are very sensible&#xD;
people in their way. They know that we in our position can neve1&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES..                       165&#xD;
think of receiving them on terms of equality and therefore have.&#xD;
the good sense, to preserve the proper distance- I do sincerly&#xD;
hope, Mr. Fox, that you will not suffer yourself to be surpassed&#xD;
by them in their sense of what is proper."&#xD;
Having said this, she arose and dropping a distant courtesy,&#xD;
withdrew from the room.&#xD;
"I thought that much" Mr. Fox remarked with a look of under-&#xD;
standing at Dolores "and can therefore hardly say, that I am die.&#xD;
appointed. She may have her pleasure: if she refuses to recog-&#xD;
nlize established facts, she may take the consequences."&#xD;
"But pa," Dolores remnonstrated. "I hardly think, that you&#xD;
would do Mr. and Mrs. Fuchs a favor by drawing them forcibly&#xD;
into your house. They would not only derive no pleasure from&#xD;
such a course ; but actually suffer from manifestations of neglect&#xD;
or contempt, with which Mrs. Fox might hardly be sparing."&#xD;
Mr. Fox reflected a while.&#xD;
"You are right Dol" he said at last, I shall not force matters,&#xD;
but leave everything to time and circumstances. Still as for my-&#xD;
self, I cannot resist the temptation to drop in at the cottage to&#xD;
shake hands with cousin Conrad and to see the fellow from across&#xD;
the ocean. Good bye children; I shall be back before the hour&#xD;
of dinner.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
A CRISIS APROACHING.&#xD;
"Captain Butler has arrived and cast anchor in the cemetery"&#xD;
George cried to Wood the same morning, rushing into the office&#xD;
with excited mien and trying to recover breath. "I have nearly&#xD;
run myself to death from the wish of impartighg the news as early&#xD;
as possible."&#xD;
"And by your haste and excitement you have drawn the atten-&#xD;
tion of spies. upon your movements. George, can you never&#xD;
learn, that selfcontrol is the first indispensable duty of any man,&#xD;
that wishes to rise above his fellow beings?"&#xD;
"To preach is easier, than to practise."&#xD;

low the world an insight in my schemes. But that is idle now&#xD;
I may as well proceed to give you further instructions. When&#xD;
did the brigg arrive?"&#xD;
"After midnight."&#xD;
"Then by this evening, the boxes will all be in the cave.&#xD;
George have a boat ready by ten'o'clock, to take us there; but&#xD;
let nobody but you a nd me know of our errand."&#xD;
"I will not, Sir."&#xD;
"One of the drafts, I was expecting, has come this morning, the&#xD;
other may be here by to-day's mail. We cannot act before it is&#xD;
in our hands. It would not do, to leave a sum of $6000.00 be-&#xD;
hind us, if we can secure it by a little waiting."&#xD;
"But waiting may endanger all.".&#xD;
"Very true, still I cannot bear the thought, of leaving such a&#xD;
sum in his clutches, I am not satisfied with crippling him: I&#xD;
want his ruin."&#xD;
George looked at him.&#xD;
"Richard" he said "with your permission I should like to ask&#xD;
a question : what makes you hate this man so much?"&#xD;
Wood shook his head.&#xD;
"I would rather not inform you. It has nothing to do with&#xD;
our project and if you get your stipulated sum, that is all you can&#xD;
in reason, ask."&#xD;
George did not answer.&#xD;
"Will you please go and see, whether the mail has come?" Wood-&#xD;
resumed. "In case the letter in question has arrived, we need&#xD;
hesitate no longer but may fix the hour the coming night. What&#xD;
do you think?"&#xD;
"Nothing at all, Sir, I leave it all to you. I'll run to the office&#xD;
now and see whether the mail is in."&#xD;
He left and 10 minutes afterwards returned with a letter, swing-&#xD;
ing it triumphantly in his hand. It bore the stamp of B. and&#xD;
Wood's face was lit with an ugly scowl, when he said:&#xD;
"That's the right one. I thought it would come to-day. That&#xD;
puts a couple of thousands more in the pocket of each of us."&#xD;
"Is there anything else to be done during the day?"&#xD;
"No Sir; only don't fail, to be at the coast this evening at eight&#xD;
o' clock."&#xD;
"I thought you told me ten before-"&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       167&#xD;
I did, but it strikes me, that we go so late, too great a portion&#xD;
of the night would be consumed by the visit. Indeed if it were&#xD;
not for the papers, I want the captain to sign, the visit would be&#xD;
altogether unnecessary."&#xD;
"But supposing you visit him during the day: wouldn't you in&#xD;
that instance get your receipt as well?"&#xD;
"I cannot get away during the day, George," the superinten-&#xD;
dent replied with a slight embarrassment.&#xD;
"There are several things, which need my presence, and in&#xD;
fact....&#xD;
"And what do you think of my going?"&#xD;
"It would; do well enough, excepting the possibility of the cap-&#xD;
tain's refusal. Having once refused you, he might become sus-&#xD;
picious and refuse me as well. On the whole, I think, it will be&#xD;
best to go at eight o'clock."&#xD;
"Very well, Sir, and when do you propose to settle our ac-&#xD;
counts ?"&#xD;
Wood smiled an ugly smile.&#xD;
"Why, Georgie, what a careful mode of doing business you&#xD;
hav e adopted all at once. You never before evinced such zeal in&#xD;
straightening up accounts."&#xD;
"Perhaps I didn't Sir in the service of Mr. Fox; but noiy, you&#xD;
know, I am minding my own business."&#xD;
"Exactly George, nor do I blame you. I shall divide with you&#xD;
before we start on our errand. In fact we might proceed at once,&#xD;
only Mr. Fox might come in the meantime and want to see the&#xD;
letters."&#xD;
"The deuce! if he should take it in his head to appropriate&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"That is not likely as he is not in the habit of doing so. In&#xD;
case he sees the money, he may desire me to settle at once the&#xD;
arrears of the laborers. In that I can accomodate him, com-&#xD;
mencing with the liquidation of your account and mine. If that&#xD;
should take all the money who could complain?"&#xD;
Wood laughed at his remark, and George followed suit. All&#xD;
at once however, they noticed Mr, Fox through the office-window&#xD;
and sobering down to their daily routine, awaited his appearance.&#xD;
He was in a very good humor, perhaps th result of the visit&#xD;
he had just paid at the cottage; at any rate, Mir. Wood had not&#xD;

seen him so gay for a good while. Mr. Fox was so easily pleased&#xD;
that the manager found no difficulty in securing his approval to&#xD;
various propositions he offered as well as his endorsement on the&#xD;
drafts in question necessary for collection.&#xD;
"Just as you please, Richard," he said, "just as you please.&#xD;
We are over our hard spell now, and every thing is prosperous.&#xD;
With due respect to your talents, don't you think that I deserve&#xD;
a little credit for the way I managed things?"&#xD;
"Of course I do, Edward and you will recollect, that I was the&#xD;
first to acknowledge my mistake and your better judgment. You&#xD;
managed admirably.",&#xD;
"Yes, yes, Richard, I did tolerably well; but then I must not&#xD;
forget, that it is chiefly due to ........ Tut, tut ! what am I gos-&#xD;
sipping about? I think my mind is wandering this morning. It&#xD;
would'nt be so very strange after all the adventures I met with.&#xD;
I tell you, Richard,-no I won't tell you either, at least not now.&#xD;
I must first sober down a little, to guard against my talking non-&#xD;
sense and thereby losing the trifle of respect I have secured from&#xD;
you for clever management."&#xD;
With this he hastened from the room, leaving the two plotters&#xD;
at a loss to comprehend him.&#xD;
" What does that mean?" George inquired. "He talks as if he&#xD;
had got tipsy early in the morning."&#xD;
"It isn't that - he never drinks anything before his dinner."&#xD;
"Some unexpected pleasure then; but of what sort ?"-.&#xD;
"Who cares ? It is enough for us, that his excitement greatly&#xD;
facilitates our measures. I venture to say, the dunce will not re-&#xD;
turn to-day, and we may as well divide our spoils at once.  Are&#xD;
you satisfied regarding our last settlement?"&#xD;
"Certainly, Richard; it was very satisfactory."&#xD;
"So much the better. Now in regard to these checks, they are&#xD;
not equal, one calling for the payment of $6,000, or the other for&#xD;
that of five : In case I give you the larger check: Will you pay&#xD;
ne the difference in cash?"&#xD;
"Why, no Mr. Wood; I should not like to do that?"&#xD;
"Not do it, George?" the other inquired somewhat astonished&#xD;
"is not the note endorsed ?"&#xD;
"It is Sir."&#xD;
"Docs that not make it as good as cash?"&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        169&#xD;
"It does, to any one, who has a chance of collecting it."&#xD;
"Why, George, you have the time."&#xD;
"Not if you want me to start for P. without delay."&#xD;
"0 you will have time, to stop long enough in town, to cash it."&#xD;
"But they might hesitate, to trust me in the Bank with such a&#xD;
sum. You know. I never drew money before."&#xD;
"But George: that objection is just as applicable to the smaller&#xD;
check."&#xD;
"It is Sir and that is the reason, why I am forced to refuse the&#xD;
'acceptance of either."&#xD;
Woods face darkened.&#xD;
"You get all at once very particular" he said "but if you think,&#xD;
that I shall humor such -notions, you are much mistaken. You&#xD;
say' you refuse the smaller draft and $500.00 in cash?"&#xD;
"I do, Sir !"&#xD;
"But you forget that by your obstinacy you run the risk of get-&#xD;
ting nothing."&#xD;
"No greater risk than you, Sir. , You may rest assured Mr.&#xD;
Wood, that I should take care in such a case, to place the money&#xD;
at a safe distance from your grasp."&#xD;
Wood looked at his accomplice with undisguised amazement.&#xD;
This was the first instance, where the lad had shown any will of&#xD;
his own and when the veiled menace  betrayal reached his ears,&#xD;
he did not know, whether he could trust them. Still George was&#xD;
right and had Wood completely at his mercy. How fortunate&#xD;
that the superintendent had not intrusted his other secret to the&#xD;
fellow as well! Thanks to his prudence, that portion of th lpro-&#xD;
gramme was safe at least. But as to. the money question, Wood&#xD;
saw no way of forcing George into compulsion and with that sag -&#xD;
acity and rapid penetration, so peculiar to his character, he saw&#xD;
at once, that it would come with a better grace, to yield at once&#xD;
than to let the final consent appear as the result of further menaces.&#xD;
"George" he said all at once, changing the nature of =his voica&#xD;
and forcing himself into, a smile. "I make you my compliment.&#xD;
You are fast reaching your maturity and exact your claims from&#xD;
me with a sharpness, which allows little doubt of your capacity&#xD;
to fo.rce your purpose. If you refuse the draft, I shall of course&#xD;
be forced to pay your share in cash, although that will necessitate&#xD;
miy staying here another day."&#xD;

"Exactly Sir, and I like that arrangement better; because it&#xD;
gives me more time, to reach P."&#xD;
More time to ruin and betray me, or at least to discover my&#xD;
trail: Mr. Wood thought to himself. But wait, I shall take mea.&#xD;
sures, to counteract all treacherous mines that you may spring on&#xD;
me.&#xD;
"Why, that is true" he said loudly, stooping to gn open safe&#xD;
and taking from it a large number of $100 notes. "Here George&#xD;
is your money and we are quit now-are we niot?"&#xD;
"Exactly, Sir !"&#xD;
"And you are satisfied?"&#xD;
"Fully so."&#xD;
"And you agree to take the information to the revenue-officers?"&#xD;
'I shall faithfully execute your commission."&#xD;
"Very well, George. I am compelled to rely upon your pro-&#xD;
mise. I would rather have you act from motives of attachment&#xD;
than of fear; but this much I say: woe to you, if you betray the&#xD;
trust I put in you."&#xD;
George's face blanched a little, but collecting himself, he .said:&#xD;
"Fear nothing, sir, I shall not dissappoint you."&#xD;
'So much the better for you. I'll have to leave you now, and-&#xD;
may be absent for an hour or two. Please have an eye to things,&#xD;
for I must not become guilty of neglect during the waning hours&#xD;
of our administration."&#xD;
He left the office and after arranging his attire, took the road&#xD;
to the mansion. On arriving there, he found that Mr. Fox had&#xD;
gone to the parsonage with the girls, and that Mrs. Fox alone&#xD;
was at home. This suited his purpose, and sending his card to,&#xD;
her, he stepped into the parlor, to await her coming. Throwing&#xD;
himself into an arm-chair, he gave himself up to the host of tu-&#xD;
multuous thoughts, that were crowding through his brain.  His&#xD;
plans had reached a climax; what he had hoped and worked and&#xD;
struggled for, was on the point of becoming a reality. Ah! it&#xD;
was well! for he felt that his mind could not have borne much&#xD;
longer, the heavy strain upon it. Fear and hope and glorious ex-&#xD;
pectation, were struggling for the mastership within his breast,&#xD;
and he found the greatest difficulty in preserving the outward&#xD;
calmness, that was so indispensable, to secure success. .&#xD;

When Mrs. Fox entered the room, he sprang up and approach-&#xD;
ed her, with a haste, that startled her.&#xD;
"What is the matter, Richard," she said, blushing at the fervor&#xD;
with which he carried her hand to his lips,"you seem ver,- much&#xD;
excited ?"&#xD;
"No wonder, Caroline. The hour has come, when I sh 11 take&#xD;
you with me, as the precious jewel which the owner hid s from&#xD;
the vulgar gaze of the curious crowd,"&#xD;
Her hand quivered in his. Laying the other that was fiee up-&#xD;
on her bosom, she replied:&#xD;
"What do you mean, Richard? Must I go, with you; must I&#xD;
leave the home of my' children? Much as I love you, I tremble&#xD;
at the thought."&#xD;
"And yet you have to learn to face it ; for I have chosen the&#xD;
coming night for'the time of our flight."&#xD;
"Impossible!" she cried, "I cannot leave so quickly: why did&#xD;
you not give me longer warning?"&#xD;
rFroi motives of affection, Caroline. I knew that you would&#xD;
worry all the time, and perhaps by worrying betray our secret.&#xD;
Besides you knew that it would come to this, and if you really&#xD;
love -me, as you say you do, you will without much difficulty, sue -&#xD;
teed in severing such bonds as tie you to this house."&#xD;
"And my dear, poor children-am I never to see them any&#xD;
more ?"&#xD;
"Not for the present Caroline. What future years may have&#xD;
in store, we do not know and it would be idle to make conjectures.&#xD;
Come now, dear Caroline, take- courage: you ought to delight in&#xD;
this opportunity of showing your love to me."&#xD;
"You cannot doubt that love Richard, after so many proofs,&#xD;
given at the coat of my tranquility of mind. But what do you&#xD;
propose to do?"&#xD;
"I shall be at the gate at 12 o'clock, to receive you and conduct&#xD;
you to the buggy, which will be waiting in the neighborhood.&#xD;
We shall at once drive to the station and be in time to take the&#xD;
early train for the border. Once in Canada we shall finsl little dif-&#xD;
iculty in concealing our trail and after a while take the steamer&#xD;
to Liverpool. In the fair regions of the old world you will soon&#xD;
forget the fetters, which tied you to the new one and in the arms&#xD;

"And am I to take nothing with me?"&#xD;
"Yes Caroline. Your departure to the city is near at hand and&#xD;
I have been thinking, that you might pack a trunk and send it to&#xD;
Adam's Express, pretending that it holds your winter-dresses,&#xD;
which need attention at the milliner's hand. You need not mark&#xD;
the trunk, but just send word by John, that you will call at the&#xD;
office to-morrow, to give directions. In that way I think you may&#xD;
without suspicion take your most valuable wardrobe along."&#xD;
"Well I will follow your advise" she answered with a sigh,&#xD;
"and God may grant-ah Richard I do not dare to call on Him&#xD;
any more."&#xD;
She shuddered and buried her face in her nands.&#xD;
"Not so, my love" he pleaded with his most alluring tones and&#xD;
soothing and consoling the conscious stricken woman, gradually&#xD;
succeeded in restoring to all appearances her peace of mind.' En&#xD;
joining upon her the necessity of caution and firmness, he left.her&#xD;
to return to the office and there watch the movements of his ae-&#xD;
complice, whose conduct had created serious misgivings in his&#xD;
mind.&#xD;
Mrs. Fox in the mean time had left the parlor and returned to&#xD;
her room, where she made preparations, to pack such articles of&#xD;
dress as her great travelling ,trunk would hold and as could be&#xD;
collected in a hurry. To say that she began the work with an&#xD;
easy heart, would do her injustice. On the contrary she took the&#xD;
various garments from the wardrobes, as if they had keen solid&#xD;
iron instead af the light and airy fabrics which they really were.&#xD;
Many a tear started from her eyes and running across her cheek&#xD;
and falling to the ground unheeded. He thoughts seemed to&#xD;
wander far away, judging from the absent look of her eyes. All&#xD;
at once however she started like one whose heart had been pierced&#xD;
by a bullet: the dress she held slipped from her fingers and her&#xD;
whole frame trembled as if in fever.&#xD;
What was the matter?&#xD;
The door had creaked on the hinges, and Lucy's voice had ex-&#xD;
claimed in great surprise:&#xD;
"Oh! mother, what is that? Moving already? I declare, you&#xD;
pack your things for going to the city, do you not?"&#xD;
That was the cause of Mrs. Fox'es sudden start.  She could&#xD;
not force herself to answer her daughter's question, but nodding&#xD;

merely with her head bent low to store the dress away, she pre-&#xD;
tended to be very busy at the task.&#xD;
Lucy laughed.&#xD;
"Too busy, to reply. I really think, that you have caught the&#xD;
working fever from Dolores. But mother, don't you fear, that&#xD;
you'll spoil Susan?"&#xD;
The name of Dolores, had nerved Mrs. Fox sufficiently to face&#xD;
her daughter's loving glances. "She will remain" she thought,&#xD;
"and nobody will miss me, except perhaps poor Dick, who will&#xD;
have a hard time, to stand the flood of reprimand and admonition.&#xD;
But I do not give him up altogether; Richard hinted at a possi-&#xD;
bility of meeting him again. ...&#xD;
Again Lucy broke in upon her train of thoughts."&#xD;
"Why, mother, are you sick? I never saw you so-so taciturn.&#xD;
I hope I have not offended you?"&#xD;
Mrs. Fox'es heart was touched by this appeal. Tears started&#xD;
to her eyes and embracing her daughter with a fervor, which&#xD;
was even stranger to the girl, than the reserve of before, she&#xD;
said with streaming eyes:&#xD;
"You offend me, Lucy ? No never, never did you in the least&#xD;
offend me. .You were always the very pattern of a good and du--&#xD;
tiful daughter."&#xD;
"But, mother, I see no reason to cry at that. I for my part am&#xD;
glad to have you tfiink and say so: why then do you talk, as if&#xD;
you meant.to leave me, never to return?"&#xD;
Mrs. Fox was frightened :&#xD;
"Foolish child, what do you talk about?" she said, casting a&#xD;
shy glance around the room. "Did I lead you, to entertain such&#xD;
silly thoughts?"&#xD;
"No mother; I only mean, you talk, so serious, as if you in-&#xD;
tended taking leave for ever."&#xD;
Mrs. Fox was deeply impressed.&#xD;
"We are mortal', she said gloomily, "and nobody knows, how&#xD;
soon we may be called from one another, never to meet again on&#xD;
earth. Lucy, would you-would you-in such a, case-sometimes&#xD;
think of me ?"&#xD;
"You know I would mother; tho' I really think, that I have as&#xD;
much right to think of dying, as you. There is something the&#xD;
matter with you, mother and you had better lie on -your lounge&#xD;

and rest, instead of packing these dresses. We are hot going to-&#xD;
morrow, you know, and you'll find plenty time yet."&#xD;
"We are not going, but the trunk is. I want to have  .. the&#xD;
milliner. ... make some alterations...."&#xD;
Lucy shook her head.&#xD;
"Mother, follow my advise and desist from working this to-day&#xD;
.I do not see..."&#xD;
This time, Mrs. Fox interrupted her sharply. She saw no other&#xD;
way to withstand the flood of emotions awakened bp her daught-&#xD;
er's gentle pleadings.&#xD;
"That is enough, Lucy" she said. I understand your motives,&#xD;
but your contradiction worries me and you will oblige me by&#xD;
desisting. Indeed I can attend much better to this work when I&#xD;
am by myself. So go to your room, until I call you or send for-&#xD;
you."~&#xD;
Lucy had listened to these words with"increasing sadness. Her,&#xD;
mother's tenderness had for. a while awakened the hope in her,&#xD;
that hereafter her mother would take her nearer to her heart, but&#xD;
now she was at once and cruelly undeceived. The animation in&#xD;
her face died away, her smile faded, and a large tear dropping&#xD;
from her eye, slowly rolled across the cheek to fall unto the floor.&#xD;
Thus she stood for half a minute, then heaving a deep sigh, she&#xD;
turned and was on the point of leaving the room, when her moth-&#xD;
er's voice stopped her.&#xD;
"Lucy !"&#xD;
When she turned, she saw Mrs. Fox with outstretched arms,&#xD;
ready to receive and fold her to her heart. Her name had been&#xD;
uttered with so much longing, such deep and yearning love, that&#xD;
Lucy felt like one stupified and instead of throwing herself at once&#xD;
into her mother's arms stood like one totally bewildered. But.&#xD;
Mrs. Fox did not wait for the return of her composure ; hasten-&#xD;
ing towards her, she flung her arms around her neck and laying&#xD;
her head upon her shonlder, cried' bitterly a~s if her heart would&#xD;
break. Lucy several times endeavored to speak to her, to sooth&#xD;
her grief and fathom its cause; but Mrs. Fox stopped her every&#xD;
time with so much earnestness, that the poor girl saw no remedy,&#xD;
but to lead her to a lounge and there resting her had against her&#xD;
own shoulder, suffer her to try~ herself to rest. Nor was she mis-&#xD;

ting posture and drying her tears remarked:-&#xD;
"There, Lucy, that will do. This has been in Ine for a long&#xD;
while and my heart being full to overflowing, the flood of tears.&#xD;
could no longer be restrained. It was well, my child, that I had&#xD;
no witness of my weakness, but you, of course you will not ex-&#xD;
pose your mother's silly conduct."&#xD;
"Of course, mother: but why?"&#xD;
"I have a second favor, to ask you Lucy: please abstain from&#xD;
questions; the time will soon arrive when you will understand me&#xD;
without interpretation"&#xD;
"I will mother, to please you: will you abstain from exhausting&#xD;
yor strength still further by attending to this unaccustomed&#xD;
labor?"atedn                                 1ailtld&#xD;

Thn a  ur obdtene twilljoin you for the balance of the day."&#xD;
To secure obedience to her wishes she gently forced the girl&#xD;
toarsh the ooklg and embracing her at every step. On&#xD;
the threshold shetge once more with fervent tenderness into&#xD;
her eyes, then turning, closed and-locked the door, leaving Lucy&#xD;

Meanwhile Mr. Wood was walking fast, to r  h&#xD;

But Wood must even guard against this latter emergency  So&#xD;

George had failed to deliver his papers in person. This letter he&#xD;
placed in his pocket, intending to drop it as soon as their flight&#xD;
would have proceeded sufficiently for to make it safe. The balance&#xD;
of the afternoon he spent in superintending the various departe-&#xD;
ments of the factory and those, who saw the calm indifference&#xD;
lying on his countenance, the sharpness, with which he reprim-&#xD;
anted slight mistakes, the orders, which he gave, affecting, the&#xD;
work of weeks, would have have hardly dreamed, that this man&#xD;
stood on the point not only of ruining his employer's business&#xD;
character, but also his social and moral position. Collecting all&#xD;
his strengbt-of mind for one last great effort, he seemed to all&#xD;
appearances as calm as the calmest and most unconcerned of all&#xD;
the men in his principal's employ.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
A FAILURE.&#xD;
"There goes a trunk from the mansion" uncle Jacob addressed&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs and Henry, who since hi's relative's arrival could not&#xD;
be persuaded to visit the factory and was stoutly backed in his&#xD;
obstinacy by that worthy relative. "There goes a trunk" the&#xD;
latter said; observing John with a springwagon, on which a large&#xD;
trunk was being taken away "and if you don't hurry Sister, you&#xD;
won't have the satisfaction, of lowering Mrs. Fox' pride a peg or&#xD;
two."&#xD;
"And how should I accomplish that, Jacob?"&#xD;
"Of course by paying her a visit in your new capacity of&#xD;
cousin."&#xD;
'In order to give her a chance of humbling me so low, that even&#xD;
dogs would refuse a piece of bread from my hand: no indeed!&#xD;
you wont catch me, to play such silly tricks."&#xD;
'P'shaw fiddlesticks! you are over' sensitive. Only let me find&#xD;
the testament, and you'll see me handle these fancy people after&#xD;
my own fashion. You are all overdelicate, excepting Henry, who&#xD;
is lad according to my heart. Just let me get hold of the last&#xD;
will, I'm hunting and I'll show you, what I mean by rewarding&#xD;
aid and sympathy."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
In this way uncle Jacob had spent the greater part of the day.&#xD;
During the absence of Conrad and Charles he tried the patience&#xD;
f his sister-in-law and when she at last began, to show signs of&#xD;
exhaustion of that useful virtue, he addressed himself to Henry&#xD;
and in him not only found a nevertiring listener but also-and&#xD;
that was more--a person willing to enter with him on such mea-&#xD;
sures, fair or foul, and spin such intrigues, as might be necessary&#xD;
to attain his purpose.&#xD;
Uncle Jacob was an everlasting talker, but the quality of his&#xD;
conversation was not at all in keeping with its quantity.. Per-&#xD;
haps that accounts for his voluminousness, and he acted on the&#xD;
principle, a man always should give a good measure of an inferior&#xD;
article; while we find another explanation in the circumstance,&#xD;
that uncle Jacob had managed to secure a key for his brother's&#xD;
winec-ellar aid that he took good care, to keep his lips well mois&#xD;
tened.&#xD;
At the time of the above remark, Jacob' had already paid fre-&#xD;
quent visits to the cellar, without however so far destroying the&#xD;
equilibrium which is necessary, to carry a person with decorum&#xD;
through his daily routine.  Still Mrs. Fuchs was afraid, that&#xD;
further visits would have.that undesirable effect and she thought&#xD;
proper to remind uncle Jacob of the fact, that they had all been&#xD;
invited to the parsonage that night, to celebrate the discovery of&#xD;
the relationship of Dol with the families of.the mansion and the&#xD;
cottage. Mr. Fox would be present she said and then hinted how&#xD;
unpleasant it must be for all concerned to have the general satis-&#xD;
faction marred or destroyed by the incapacity of one visitor, to&#xD;
conduct himself with common propriety.&#xD;
Jacob resented the insinuation in his usual blunt way; but yet&#xD;
he proved by his abstinence from further potations, that he well&#xD;
understood the importance, of meeting with prudent reservation&#xD;
the man, whom he had good reason to believe his rival for the ac-&#xD;
quisition of countless wealth. Besides, they were to visit a preach.&#xD;
er'r house and Charles had taken pleasure in telling his uncle that&#xD;
preachers in this country always stand on great ceremony and do&#xD;
not say or suffer to be said in their presence any thing, that is not&#xD;
unexceptional in all its bearings.&#xD;
At supper-time the men came home; but taking- merely time&#xD;
enough to change their suits, they and the rest of the family so~u&#xD;

.started on their way to the parsonage, were they were expected&#xD;
to take supper. At the gate of the mansion they where joined by&#xD;
Mr. Fox and the girl, Mrs. Fox having plead a headache as her ex-&#xD;
cuse for remaining at home. Mr. Fox smiled when she made the&#xD;
statement, but little did he dream of the fearful crisis which was&#xD;
fast approaching, while he in company of his daughters left the&#xD;
house to spend a few hours in social intercourse. Enjoy them,&#xD;
poor fellow! who knows, how soon an hour will come round again&#xD;
which does not contain the element of great bitterness?&#xD;
The parsonage was decorated in a manner, becoming the occa-&#xD;
sion. Miss Sarah had plundered her flower-garden, to secure a&#xD;
fine bouquet for every table in the house. The dining-room es-&#xD;
pecially bore a gay look and the hostess was greatly pleased to&#xD;
see so much praise bestowed upon her arrangements. She smiled&#xD;
through tears when she took both the hands of Dolores. '&#xD;
"Dol, my good girl" she said drawing her old ward into her&#xD;
arms and kissing her with warm affection. "I wish you luck to&#xD;
your acquisitions. I and my brother are the only friends that&#xD;
haven't turned into kindred : will you still allow us to think of&#xD;
you as we are wont to do-that is our daughter?"&#xD;
"Of course I will" Dolores said. "I shall not mei'ely allow it,&#xD;
but demand it. Indeed the daughter comes before the cousin&#xD;
and if the latter is not satisfied. with that arrangement he may ex-&#xD;
pect short notice to quit."&#xD;
"Why! this is dreadful for all concerned!" Charles now struck&#xD;
in. I fortunately am not in that dilemma. In my case the cousin&#xD;
does not interfere with the daughter, although I could no doubt&#xD;
summon the necessary dignity for a graceful performance of a-&#xD;
father's role."&#xD;
One playful word produced another and even before the com-&#xD;
pany had seated themselves around the well spread table, every&#xD;
trace of restraint had vanished, excepting uncle Jacob who was&#xD;
unable to follow the conversation, which was carried on in English.&#xD;
To indemnify himself he bestowed his undivided attention upon&#xD;
Miss Sarah's dishes, which met with his profound approbation.&#xD;
At first she was delighted to see him appreciate her culinary ef-&#xD;
forts so well; but by and by her delight assumed the character of&#xD;
alarm, as-she had never before seen a person,.that could let cakes&#xD;
and pies custards and jellies disappear with such marvelous rapid-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
ity. hO course, she was too kind and welibred, to make remarks&#xD;
but the timid glance with which she followed the gluttons motions&#xD;
spoke plain enough. Charles and Dolores enjoyed her scare and&#xD;
were extremely amused at the energy, with which the spinster&#xD;
.ged Sares of the company, to partake of her good things.&#xD;
andellfed ah'sdiay diddnot spring from any avarice, but from&#xD;
al wtefondhd apprehension that, in spite of the bounteous sup-&#xD;
ply, the others would have no chance of admiring her killing cook-&#xD;
was allowed sewing and preserving, if this locust without wings&#xD;
s aowed to continue his depredations without a check. From&#xD;
the spinsters frcompassion therefore the young people seconded&#xD;
the   artses etrts, partly by letting the dishes wander round the&#xD;
tab, pTy by drawing uncle Jacob into a conversation in- Ger-&#xD;
man. This latter remedy fully answered the purpose. Putting&#xD;
thaallotoesteam of his lingual engine, he tore away at such a rate&#xD;
that Dolores thought tne medicine was worse than the evil and&#xD;
told her friend as much in a confidential whisper.&#xD;
Charles laughed.&#xD;
"Its a pity, that men like him don't carry a safety valve on their&#xD;
raesUnle carries on such a pressure of steam, that an explo-&#xD;
sion wouldn't at all astonish me."&#xD;
But this whispering was contraband. Uncle Jacob told them&#xD;

cam the viims of their generosity, For that however the&#xD;

aboeutil cT er-night, with a starry sky of rare brightness&#xD;

the ear with great plainness.&#xD;
g"Listen, Dol," Charles addressed his friend, with whom he was&#xD;
anering up and down the garden-walk, "some one is loosening&#xD;
boat: that is a grand night for a ride on the bay."&#xD;
but who may have any business out there so late? The fish.'&#xD;
lug season is over; is it not?"&#xD;
"Yes, Dol. I hardly know, who could be out so late:  There&#xD;

Some one approaching, the conversation took a different turn.&#xD;
The evening passed away pleasantly, and therefore rapidly. It&#xD;
was fully ten o' clock when the gathering broke up and the guests&#xD;
with many a "good night" departed. Their ways ran together to&#xD;
the parkgate of the mansion, and there the scene of parting was&#xD;
acted over again. All this had caused delay, and when the last noise&#xD;
died away in the cottage; the clock struck eleven. Everybody&#xD;
soon found rest and oblivion in the arms of sleep, excepting uncle&#xD;
Jacob. The injudicious packing of so many victuals, after many&#xD;
months of compulsory fasting, began to avenge itself. Even on&#xD;
the way home, Jacob began to feel uncomfortable.  is stomach&#xD;
had indulged in queer heavings, which reminded him tf the time&#xD;
when he was on the ocean, and had fallen a prey to sea-sickness.&#xD;
On his arrival at the.cottage, he had paid a visit to the cellar, and&#xD;
there, endeavored by a large tumbler full of rum, to compromise&#xD;
the matter with his stomach; but like most compromises, that of&#xD;
uncle J- 'lob's had merely a temporary effect, and he had hardly&#xD;
been in bed an hour, when strange sensations made him rise.&#xD;
His bowels pained as if some force- was tearing them asunder;&#xD;
his head grew dizzy and he would have sworn that he was unable&#xD;
to stir a foot, if certain laws of nature, which no man can escape,&#xD;
had not forced him to leave his room and the house in hot haste.&#xD;
Uncle Jacob had no time to arouse the family even if lie had been&#xD;
inclined to do so; but forward and callous as he was, he felt a cer-&#xD;
tain shame arising from the consciousness of the origin of his&#xD;
sickness.&#xD;
In the open air he felt a little better; but yet the revolution in&#xD;
his bowels would not let him rest. He felt a crisis coming near-&#xD;
er and nearer and an increasing nausea drove him from the garden&#xD;
to the street. He hardly knew, that he went there, much less&#xD;
why: a new cramp in his stomach forced him to lay both his&#xD;
hands upon the aching part; the heaving within became more and&#xD;
more tumultuous and then uncle Jacob underwent the disagreable&#xD;
sensation of a man, who has his stomach relieved by the process&#xD;
which in common parlance we call vomiting.&#xD;
Ie had sinned considerably against his stomach and his pen-&#xD;
was in proportion. A full quarter of an hour passed by, be-&#xD;
fofrhe could venture to straighten himself up again.  Wonder-&#xD;
ful sensations had in the meantime passed through his brain. lie&#xD;

had an indistinct retollection of the tramping of a horse and the&#xD;
rolling of carriage-wheels. On reaching the place of the road&#xD;
opposite the cottage the horse had shed at him if his impression&#xD;
was correct, and after bounding sideways with a jerk. that sent&#xD;
the wagon -spmning, had started off at a furious gallop. He had&#xD;
also heard a scream, that seemed to emanate from the lips of a&#xD;
woman, judging from its shrill nature and high pitch-or had he&#xD;
been only dreaming that part? No indeed, for listen ! there it is&#xD;
again, tho' not so shrill now, but low and moaning as issuing&#xD;
from a person in the agonies of pain. It is near by, quite near&#xD;
on the other side of the road and there is something lying on&#xD;
the ground, that resembles a human.being...&#xD;
Jacob had now fully recovered from his sickness. Coarse and&#xD;
forward as he was, he could not help being impressed by those&#xD;
pitiful moans and running to the spot where the figure lay, dis-&#xD;
covered to his consternation a woman in a state of semi-consci-&#xD;
ousness. From her mouth came the plaintive sounds, that had&#xD;
moved and startled him; but they grew lower every minute caus-&#xD;
ing him to fancy, that the poor sufferer was fast approaching&#xD;
death. Jacob was in great tribulation. He tried to lift the head&#xD;
and shoulders of the person; but a louder moan induced him to&#xD;
drop her again.&#xD;
"I can do nothing by myself," he muttered and running rapidly&#xD;
into the house knocked at the door of the chamber, where the&#xD;
boys were sleeping.&#xD;
"Charles! Henry! get up ! get up, I say."&#xD;
Charles was the first to answer.&#xD;
"Who is there ?"&#xD;
"I, uncle Jacob. For God's sake, get up and open. There is&#xD;
a woman dying on the road. She must have fallen from a wagon."&#xD;
"A.woman you say?" Charles inquired obeying his injunctions,&#xD;
here is she ? what is the matter with her?"&#xD;
"She is dying on the road, I say. B3 quick boys, or you won't&#xD;
find her alive."&#xD;
"Are you sure you ain't dreaming uncle?" Charles inquired&#xD;
with a dubious shake of his head, but hurrying his dressing as&#xD;
much as possible notwithstanding.&#xD;
"You will soon. find that out, when you reach the road" Jacob&#xD;
anshwered.&#xD;

"Come on then uncle, I am ready,"&#xD;
Rushing down stairs the two soon stood beside the prostrate&#xD;
form, which by that time had ceased to give any signs of pain or&#xD;
even life.'&#xD;
"She is dead" Jacob said with a shudder.&#xD;
"No, she is not" Charles replied "she is still warm.  Lend me&#xD;
a hand uncle; we must carry her into the house. I have a good&#xD;
hold of the shoulders and you take the feet. Where is Henry?"&#xD;
"Gone to sleep again, I guess."&#xD;
"The drowsy good-for-nothing! We have to do without him&#xD;
then. Are you ready? Lift her up then."&#xD;
"It will give her pain," Jacob suggested, as they were carrying&#xD;
the body towards the gate.&#xD;
"Not now; you see she has fainted; and if she had'nt, it can't&#xD;
be helped. We cannot leave her in the open street.  I-f that&#xD;
sleepy-head had only got up.-ah! there is mother with a light;&#xD;
I am so glad. Mother turn the lamp this way! We have a poor&#xD;
woman, that has come to harm someway or other."&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs had much of Charlie's resoluteness; she was a&#xD;
woman for emergenci'es. Instead of indulging in useless ex-&#xD;
clamations, she held her peace, obeying her son's injunctions and&#xD;
thus enabling the men, to take their burden to the porch and&#xD;
thence into a spare bedroom, that adjoined the parlor.&#xD;
The body was laid upon the bed and the bonnet and thick veil,&#xD;
which covered head and face, removed Then, when the lamp&#xD;
was raised for further inspection it threw its rays upon a face,&#xD;
the sight of which drew a simultaneous cry from both mother&#xD;
and son. The lamp in Mrs. Fuchs' hand shook so as to make&#xD;
the chimney rattle and she had to put it on the table, to prevent&#xD;
its falling. The eyes of the two met in a long and significant&#xD;
glance. "She here!" it seemed to say "and at this hour! and in&#xD;
this dreadful condition ! what can it mean?"&#xD;
But there the inquest ended, No sound was suffered to escape&#xD;
their lips, to give voice to the mute supposition; even the wond-&#xD;
ering inquiry of uncle Jacob was disregarded and conquering&#xD;
their excitement with a strong resolve, the two set to work with&#xD;
a will.&#xD;
"Water, Charlie !" Mrs. Fuchs said in a manner, that made the&#xD;
words come out, as if under a strong pressure "I'll see to all the&#xD;

rest. Jacob, please summon Conrad down; but leave Henry&#xD;
where he is. You also would do better to retire, may be; for you&#xD;
look sick and tired and we can get along without you."&#xD;
"But Jacob was not to be removed in that way. He suihmoned&#xD;
Conrad to be astir: but as to going to bed, he couldn't think of it.&#xD;
He had discovered that woman and if it hadn't been for him, they&#xD;
would have found her dead in the street on the coming morning.&#xD;
And yet he should be put aside on the plea of consideration and&#xD;
never know, what that cry of mother and son meant? Not he,&#xD;
indeed.&#xD;
During the absence of the meli, Mrs. Fuchs had removed the&#xD;
garments of the sufferer by cutting them apart; she had also pul-&#xD;
led off her shoes and when Charles returned with a basin of water&#xD;
and a sponge, he found her nicely covered with a quilt Mrs.&#xD;
Fuchs took the sponge and bathing the temples of the woman&#xD;
with the cooling fluid, endeavared to recall her into consciousness&#xD;
She succeeded in a measure, for the patient opened her eyes, but&#xD;
the glance she cast on ier surroundings showed by its vacancy&#xD;
that though no longer in a swoon, her mind was wandering,.&#xD;
At this moment Mr. Fuchs came in the room, with Jacob at his&#xD;
heels. His face showed some uneasiness, but he evidently did&#xD;
not guess the truth, for when his wife lifted her hand in caution&#xD;
and stepping up to him, whispered a word into his ear, he started&#xD;
with a look of consternation, which seemed to say: how is that&#xD;
possible? But when he neared the bed and cast a glance upon&#xD;
its inmate, he saw that it was just as his wife had intimated.&#xD;
Folding his hands he merely uttered:&#xD;
"Gracious God !"&#xD;
Charles roused his parents from their torpor.&#xD;
"This will not do" he said, "we must at once take measures to&#xD;
secure medical aid and then to notify her husband."&#xD;
"Good heavens! could it just be possible, that he should be&#xD;
ignorant of her absenee from home at this late hour?"&#xD;
"No guesses mother. See rather to her comfort. I'll go and&#xD;
get the Doctor and then call at the mansion.&#xD;
He went away leaving his parents alone with the sufferer.&#xD;
Uncle Jacob would have liked nothing better, than to keep them&#xD;
Company; but a plain hint of his nephew sufficed to send himto&#xD;
is room. We have intimated before, that the young man had&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7070-00000093"/>&#xD;
184                    DOLORES.&#xD;
managed to secure his relative's respect in a considerable degree,&#xD;
and Jacob saw fit, to mind the son in a matter, where the mother&#xD;
had hinted in vain. True, uncle Jacob muttered somewhat on&#xD;
retiring to his room; but he was doubly sleepy in consequence of&#xD;
his "parforce" cure and found consolation for his slight the mo-&#xD;
ment he stretched upon his mattress.&#xD;
Not so the pair at the sick bed. They knew, that Charles would&#xD;
use the utmost speed, in fetching the Doctor and yet the time&#xD;
elapsing before his arrival, appeared to them almost like eternity.&#xD;
At last the garden-gate was swung, the door was opened and the&#xD;
physician of the village made his appearance in the room. Char-&#xD;
les evidently had prepared him in a measure for the sight in store,&#xD;
for the man of science was more excited than the Fuchs' had&#xD;
ever seen him before,&#xD;
"Good evening friends" he said in a low but hurried accent,&#xD;
your son has told me strange news. Mrs. Fox thrown from a&#xD;
carriage and that at midnight! Ah! there, she is poor soul.&#xD;
Please madam move a little, to give me a chance of examining&#xD;
her. Has she spoken since the accident?"&#xD;
"Not a word Doctor. She was unconscious when they fetched&#xD;
her in; but the cold water brought her too. She looks delirious."&#xD;
"She is delirious and J should not wonder, if :a brainfever&#xD;
w gld set in, in consequence of the fall."               -&#xD;
"Is anything broken Doctor?"&#xD;
"I think not: but her case is had enough without it. Please&#xD;
to get some linen or muslin, madam. I want to lay wet bandages&#xD;
around her head."&#xD;
While -Mrs. Fuchs procured the desired stuff, the door opened&#xD;
again, this time admitting Mr. Fox and Charles. The former was&#xD;
perfectly bewildered, showing clearly by his conduct, that he was&#xD;
as much at a loss to comprehend his wife's present flight, as the&#xD;
family in the cottage. Neglecting to greet the persons in the&#xD;
room, he hastily stepped up to the bed and gazed with intense&#xD;
anxiety into the vacant eye of his wife. He saw how the doctor&#xD;
applied the wet bandages and also how he forced seie medicine&#xD;
through her compressed lips; but more than ten minutes had&#xD;
elapsed since his arrival, before he finally asked:&#xD;
"Doctor, is there any hope?"&#xD;
His voice was so hollow, that all were startled.&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        185&#xD;
"I- can say nothing definite, Mr- Fox," the physician replied.&#xD;
"As far as I can judge there are no bones broken; but the head&#xD;
has evidently received a jar and I am afraid, a brainfever may&#xD;
set in."&#xD;
"Then she cannot be removed?"&#xD;
"No Sir; the most absolute rest and tranquillity are necessary&#xD;
for the patient. If you remove her, I can answer for nothing."&#xD;
"Oh! she is in good hands," Mrs. Fuchs earnestly remarked.&#xD;
"Dont fret on that score Mr. Fox."&#xD;
He looked at her intently; then shook his head.&#xD;
'It isn't that" he said. "I wouldn't want better care; but the&#xD;
people, madam,the people !"&#xD;
They understood well what he meant, but nobody came forward&#xD;
to offer consolation.&#xD;
"What will they say, when the rumor spreads about, that Mrs.&#xD;
Fox was, found at midnight on the highway without her husband's&#xD;
knowledge of the fact ?"&#xD;
"Now, don't take it so hard Mr. Fox," the owner of the cottage&#xD;
said with an effort of consolation. "Mrs. Fox may have had very&#xD;
good reasons for being out and as to the people-why I do not&#xD;
see, why they need ever learn anything about it. Doctor Palmer&#xD;
is the only one besides the family that knows the whole affair and&#xD;
I am sure, he is not the man to carry gossip to the people."&#xD;
"Of course Mr. Fox, we can keep the whole affair a secret, if&#xD;
you think best to have it so."&#xD;
"That is a good idea" Mrs. Fuchs exclaimed, "until we know&#xD;
the object of Mrs. Fox'es being out at so late an hour, we must&#xD;
endeavor to keep the whole affair a secret. Was -it John that&#xD;
drove her ?"&#xD;
"No madam, he is at home ; so are the horses.  That is what&#xD;
bothers me. I hav'nt the least idea, what this strange move-&#xD;
ment signifies."&#xD;
"Well, don't you fret about it now, Mr. Fox.  I am sure; we&#xD;
shall soon get the clue, to the mystery. But listen, she begins&#xD;
to talk: is that a good sign Dr, ?"&#xD;
The physcian merely answered by a "pst!" and all could dis-&#xD;
tinctly hear how the patient said:&#xD;
"The horse Richard! the horse!"&#xD;
After a minute's silence she resumed:&#xD;
&#xD;
N&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7070-00000094"/>&#xD;
186                     DOLORES.&#xD;
"Let me off, Richard ! Let me off to return to my children.&#xD;
What will they think of their mother?"&#xD;
Another pause.&#xD;
"They will point with their fingers at me; at me, the adulteress !"&#xD;
Mr. Fox covered his face ; then groaned aloud.&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs laid her hand upon his shoulder.&#xD;
"Now don't! don't condemn her on the testimony of a feverish&#xD;
brain. You see she does not know, what she is talking of."&#xD;
"I know she does'nt" he said bitterly. "If she was sensible,&#xD;
she would hide that confession in the deepest recesses of her&#xD;
ouL"&#xD;
All felt the force of his remark.&#xD;
"I could have borne much from her" he continued, "I did bear&#xD;
much. But that she should have sullied my honor, should have&#xD;
found the heart to abandon my home and children, to cover us&#xD;
with shame, that is too much, is more than I can ever forgive&#xD;
her."&#xD;
Again Mrs. Fuchs attempted to console him.&#xD;
"Mr. Fox" she said "do not rashly judge, or you may be judged&#xD;
again. Even if your conjectures be correct-a thing, which is by&#xD;
no means certain-you should thank God for his gracious: inter-&#xD;
ference and that he has put her plans to naught. There she lies&#xD;
helpless and prostrate. How fortunate that it was just our house,&#xD;
in which she was received. If she should not recover from her&#xD;
injuries, silence will forever cover her mistake; if on the other&#xD;
hand she is restored to health, she will have learned a lesson and&#xD;
you Sir, in time will not withold your pardon. But now Sir,&#xD;
talk no more, for, unless I am mistaken, she hears us and becomes&#xD;
excited."&#xD;
The doctor agreeing with her, the room became perfectly still.&#xD;
Charles at the doctor's request accompanied him to his office, to&#xD;
take the proper medicine back to the cottage. Mr. Fox eon-&#xD;
sented to return to the mansion and tell a plausible story in the&#xD;
morning, so as to shape public opinion and to prevent idle rumors&#xD;
from spreading amongst the neighbors. He was to call however&#xD;
in the morning and to bring Dolores with him, so that the girl&#xD;
might assist 3rs. Fuchs and relieve her in a measure of the burden,&#xD;
which thissick spell in her house imposed upon her. Mr. Fuchs&#xD;
retired to a 'lounge in a neighboring room and his wife assumed&#xD;
&#xD;
her seat at the side of the bed, to watch the patient and adminis-&#xD;
the medicine in accordance with the doctor's directions.  When&#xD;
Charles returned she tried to persuade him too, to catch a little&#xD;
more sleep; but he refused so definitely, that she gave it up, to&#xD;
carry the point and allowed him to share the vigil at the bedside.&#xD;
Thus the hours of the night wore off End with the returning&#xD;
sun the doctor again made his appearance.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
IT NEVER RAINS, BUT IT POURS.&#xD;
He was not alone; Mr. Fox and'the two young ladies appeared&#xD;
in his company. The intelligence elicited from Mrs. Fuchs was&#xD;
not satisfactory. The patient had had a restless night and&#xD;
spoken considerably in the same strain as that related. In fact&#xD;
she hesitated, to admit the girls into her room and taking Mr.&#xD;
Fox aside intimated as much: It would hardly do, she said, to&#xD;
allow Lucy to listen to a mother proclaiming continually her own&#xD;
shame. And yet how would they refuse her? On what plea&#xD;
should they exclude her from the presence of a mother, that&#xD;
might die before the setting of another sun? The Doctor was&#xD;
consulted and induced to state,- that the presence of too many&#xD;
persons would injure the condition of the patient; but Lucy&#xD;
generally so gentle and yielding was deaf to all persuasions this&#xD;
time. Indeed she guessed the truth and told them as much.&#xD;
"L et me in" she pleaded "for my place is at my mothers bed-&#xD;
side. If she is delirious and in her fever talks at random, I shall&#xD;
not hear it, atleast not heed it. So do not hinder me from going&#xD;
in to her. .I shall not make the least noise, nor be at all in the&#xD;
way; but see her and nurse her, I must, indeed I must."&#xD;
What should they do?   She guessed the truth and so they&#xD;
thought at last, they might as well indulge her. To the entrance&#xD;
of Dolores there was no objection after that; indeed nobody&#xD;
seemed to think it wrong from the beginning. She was strong&#xD;
of mid, they knew. To imagine that she might be injured in her&#xD;
morals, N ould be preposterous. The even tenor of her mind, her&#xD;
high principles, the purity of her heart, that lit up her face as it&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
187&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7070-00000095"/>&#xD;
188                     DOLORES.&#xD;
were, with a hal of innocence, excluded the thought of even the&#xD;
possibility, that she might be injured by 'the contact with sin&#xD;
and evil. Nobody ever mentioned this in words; or thought of&#xD;
it even in distinct thoughts; but that is the triumph of a pure&#xD;
and high strung nature, that it fills all around it with an instinc-&#xD;
tive confidence, a trust as much a matter of course as the eternal&#xD;
laws of nature.&#xD;
So the girls were admitted in the room and after a few pangs,&#xD;
of bitter anguish on the part of Lucy and rapidly suppressed&#xD;
tears of sympathy on that of Dolores, the young nurses entered&#xD;
upon their duties. There is a soothing influence in youth, gentle-&#xD;
ness and beauty even upon sickness and the feverish blood of&#xD;
poor Mrs. Fox seemed to flow less violently through her veins.&#xD;
Perhaps the Doctor's medicine also began to take effect and half&#xD;
an hour after Mr. Fox' arrival at the cottage his wife fell into&#xD;
a sleep, which tho' broken and feverish as it was, might be con-&#xD;
sidered as a great improvement on her previous ravings. It&#xD;
also gave the others a chance for a short deliberation, on the&#xD;
course which had better be pursued) It was impossible to con-&#xD;
ceal the sickness of Mrs. Fox altogether; but it was to be hoped,&#xD;
that they might succeed in giving it a natural explanation. She&#xD;
had been sick for some time, and under the influence of a slow&#xD;
fever packed and dispatched her trunk. In the night her fever&#xD;
had increased sufficiently, to cause an aberration ofher mind. In&#xD;
this delirious condition she had wandered from the house and&#xD;
taken refuge at the cottage where she was kindly received and&#xD;
nursed, the malignant nature of the sickness making a removal&#xD;
of the patient impossible.&#xD;
This story, they hoped, might find credence with the public,&#xD;
provided it was systematically repeated by all concerned.. True,&#xD;
it was beyond their power, to prevent idle gossips from starting&#xD;
rumors; but a frown at the proper time would suffice to chase&#xD;
them from open day into the night, where they, pat-like, might&#xD;
eek out a shadowy existence. The only danger of betrayal lay&#xD;
with uncle Jacob and Charles volunteered, to take upon himself&#xD;
the task of securing his silence.&#xD;
"I think I can manage him" he said "and may as well go up at&#xD;
once, to try. Bat before I forget it: when I returned with the&#xD;
medicine from Dr. Palmer's offiee I saw something white lying&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       189&#xD;
on the road, at the place, where we discovered Mrs. Fox. On&#xD;
closer examination I found it to be a letter, and thinking, that it&#xD;
might have fallen from the poor lady, I put it in my pocket, to&#xD;
hand it to Mr. Fox in the morning. Here it is, Sir, and you had&#xD;
better examine it, while I go up, to see to uncle Jacob."&#xD;
With these words he, pulled an envelope from his pocket,&#xD;
that was unsealed and unadressed, though it evidently .con-&#xD;
tamed a letter,' judging from its -eight and stiffness. He&#xD;
handed it to 1Mr. Fox and then left the room and went up&#xD;
stairs to see his uncle. The sickness and vigil of last night had&#xD;
prolonged Mr. Jacob's slumber and Charles had to shake him&#xD;
considerably, to secure his awaking.&#xD;
"Ah! yes, yes, ah ! what is the matter? is that you Charlie?&#xD;
what is it my lad ?"&#xD;
"Are you fully awake, uncle?"&#xD;
"Wide awake, like a lark, Charlie !"&#xD;
"And do you recollect last night's adventure ?"&#xD;
"Exactly !" he exclaimed, although it was evident that only his&#xD;
nephew's inquiry had roused his memory. "The woman, that&#xD;
had fallen from the carriage; is she dead Charlie ?"&#xD;
His voice became low and husky at this question.&#xD;
"No uncle, she is alive and may recover. It was on her ae-&#xD;
count, that I came to speak to you."&#xD;
Uncle Jacob straightened himself rapidly; his interest had been&#xD;
awakened and he inquired with eagerness:&#xD;
"Well, Charlie I am all attention; what have you to tell inc&#xD;
about the woman?"&#xD;
"You saw mother and me start last night on recognizing her.&#xD;
You won't wonder at that, when I tell you, that the woman is&#xD;
the mistress of the mansion-Mrs. Fox."&#xD;
"Whey! Charlie, you dont say so !"&#xD;
"Yes, I do uncle; it is Mrs. Fox, that now lies down stairs with&#xD;
a typhoid fever."&#xD;
"Typhoid fever? Strange! I never heard of anybody getting&#xD;
that from falling off a wagon ?"&#xD;
. "But she didn't fall from a wagon, uncle" Charles said, impres-&#xD;
sively, looking at his i'elative significantly. "I came up for cor-&#xD;
recting that impression."&#xD;
"But I heard the wagon, Charlie."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7070-00000096"/>&#xD;
190                    DOLORES.&#xD;
"Nothing but the fancy of a sick brain."&#xD;
"I tell you, it was no such thing, boy. I saw the horse too and&#xD;
I could swear...."&#xD;
"You better not uncle," Charles interrupted him.&#xD;
It is just, as I tell you. Mrs. Fox has not fallen from the&#xD;
wagon, but is suffering from a typhoid fever."&#xD;
"But Charlie....." the obstinate fellow resumed.&#xD;
"Why uncle, I wonder at your dull comprehension" the young&#xD;
man said impatiently 'fallen or not fallen-she mustn't have fal-&#xD;
len, but suffer from a typhoid fever. Do you understand now?"&#xD;
"Yes, yes, I see, you want to hush the matter up."&#xD;
"Exactly and will you promise to let nobody know, the real&#xD;
state of affairs."&#xD;
"Of course, my boy, if I can do you a favor by it,."&#xD;
"Not even Henry?"&#xD;
"You want even him to remain in ignorance ?,&#xD;
"Him more than all the rest. He gossips like an old woman."&#xD;
"Well if it must be, I will not tell him. It will go hard though,&#xD;
for I like the boy."&#xD;
A derisive smile passed over Charlie's countenance..&#xD;
"It must be uncle, and now let me tell you. By hinting a word&#xD;
of this affair to anybody, you will make me your enemy-do you&#xD;
know, what that signifies, to have me for an enemy?"&#xD;
Charles looked daggers while he said this. Uncle Jacob had&#xD;
an idea and he said so.&#xD;
"Well I am glad of it. However I would rather be your friend&#xD;
and if you humor me in this, I shall befriend you. I have an&#xD;
idea, where Eberhardt's testament may be concealed and if I find&#xD;
you a man of your word, I may assist you in discovering it."&#xD;
Charles could not well have hit upon a more powerful incentive,&#xD;
to shut his uncle's mouth. Jacob's eye had lit at the mention of&#xD;
the will, and he was on the point of launching on a torrent of&#xD;
eager questions, when a rapat the door interrupted him. Charles&#xD;
opened and saw Mr. Fox standing outside. Dejected, as that&#xD;
gentleman had been since the discovery of his wife's want of fidel-&#xD;
ity, he looked so pale and frightened, so much the prey of hope-&#xD;
less consternation, that Charles at once guessed a new calamity.&#xD;
Stepping out to him and closing the door behind him, he asked&#xD;
in guarded tones:&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       191&#xD;
"What is the matter Sir? She isn't worse, not dying?"&#xD;
Mr. Fox shook his head.&#xD;
"The letter ! the letter!" he gasped pointing to an open paper&#xD;
he held in his trembling hand.&#xD;
"What letter, Mr. Fox? The one 1 gave you?"&#xD;
Mr. Fox nodded.&#xD;
"Take and read" he said, "I am a ruined man."&#xD;
Charles took the letter, but instead of looking at it, he said:&#xD;
"Come Mr. Fox, let us go down into the parlor or the arbor be&#xD;
hind the house. This is too public a place, to discuss delicate&#xD;
matters. Come my dear Sir."&#xD;
Taking the other's arm, he led him down stairs.&#xD;
"Does my father know about this ?" he asked on the way.&#xD;
"No Charlie, I thought of you first. I knew that I could rely&#xD;
on your judgment and energy above that of all others."&#xD;
"Thank you, Sir, for your good opinion; but father is a man of&#xD;
much experience, though a little timed in consequence of earlv&#xD;
training: Have you any objection, if we draw him iii the secret?"&#xD;
"Not the least, Charlie; on the contrary, I applaud your pro-&#xD;
position. Call him at once."&#xD;
Charles found hisfather making preparations for going to the&#xD;
factory. Looking at the clock on the mantelpiece he saw that&#xD;
the hand had passed the hour of six by thirty minutes.&#xD;
"Have you had your breakfast father?"&#xD;
"A bite Charlie, a cold bite. [thought I wouldn't wait for any-&#xD;
thing else, for my presence may be necessary at the factory."&#xD;
Charles looked up; the thought of Mr. Wood struck him for&#xD;
the first time. Had he any connection with the letter? But he&#xD;
had no leisure to meditate now, so he said:&#xD;
"Dont go for a minute or two, father. Mr. Fox wants youin&#xD;
the garden."&#xD;
e Fuchs nodded without asking questions and the two went int&#xD;
the grape arbor, where they found Mr. Fox sitting at a table, his&#xD;
had resting heavily on his hand.&#xD;
"Here we are, Sir," Charles addressed him "and ready to listen.&#xD;
You may beforehand rest assured of our assistance, feeble as it&#xD;
'Thank you" Mr. Fox said monotonously, at the same time&#xD;
handing him the letter.e&#xD;

Charles opened it and recognizing the handwriting exclaimed:&#xD;
"Mr. Wood's hand: shall I read aloud?"&#xD;
"If you please Charlie."&#xD;
Foxville Date-blank.&#xD;
To Lieutenant D-, commander of the Revenue Cutter Speed.&#xD;
Dear Sir!&#xD;
It is my painful duty, to inform you today of a nefarious&#xD;
practice to which Edward Fox of Foxville of L-County Maine&#xD;
and a manufacturing house of England are parties. A smuggling&#xD;
trade of steel has been carried on between these parties for years&#xD;
and on so grand a scale, that the Government has been cheated&#xD;
out of thousands. A few days ago I dispatched a messenger to&#xD;
you with the necessary evidence to prove the misdemeanor; but&#xD;
fearing, that for some reason or other, the information may not&#xD;
reach you, I take pains, to send you these lines. If you will take&#xD;
the trouble to visit the coast of Maine near Foxville and there&#xD;
examine the cave of the cemetery, you will find ample proofs of&#xD;
the correctness of my statement. Hoping that the law will have&#xD;
its way and that this great swindle will find the punishment due&#xD;
to it, I sign myself truly yours&#xD;
A LAW ABIDING CITIZEN.&#xD;
"The scoundrel!" Mr. Fox exclaimed with a readiness showing&#xD;
that he had for once overcome his diffidence.&#xD;
"Yes, more than scoundrel!" Cnaries struck in." Now I under'&#xD;
stand his machinations."&#xD;
"I don't" Mr. Fox said with an apathetic voice. "What can&#xD;
he mean with this senseless information ? It is not only fear that&#xD;
moved me so,- it is horror at such black ingratitude."&#xD;
"When I explain, you will understand it easily enough. First&#xD;
let me tell you, that Mr. Wood has been really smuggling and for&#xD;
several years."&#xD;
His hearers started.r&#xD;
"Smuggling? and you knew it and did not inform me?" Mr.&#xD;
Fox said half, wonderingly half indignantly.&#xD;
"Yes Sir I knew it and so did Dolores. Allow me to tell you,&#xD;
how we found it out and why we concealed it from your know-&#xD;
ledge. We may have been wrong; but if we were, it was a fault&#xD;
of the head, ot of the heart."&#xD;
He now re ted the adventure with the sled and his subsequent&#xD;
discoveries. He gave as the reason of his, secrecy the wish t&#xD;
catch the offender in the act of smuggling, but laboring under&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES                         193&#xD;
the difficulty of being obliged&#xD;
failed in satisfying his hearers.s&#xD;
''You meant well, Charlie." MI&#xD;
meant well; for by        .   r. Fox. replied. "J knew you&#xD;

"Yes Charlie, you did wrong" Mr. Fuch      - -&#xD;
was always your fault, to act too". Fcs now joined in. "It&#xD;
mas aw br fabut to a   oo indepentendly and your conduct&#xD;
may now bring about the ruin of our benefactor."&#xD;
Thisa was more than Charles could bear. He-sprang to his et&#xD;

right and even if the revenue officers should raise the charge of&#xD;
smuggling his testimony and that of Dolores would et arge uf&#xD;

After this remark he stopped and both the elder men involun-&#xD;
tarily turned to Charles, as if they expected to receive from him&#xD;
directions as to what else was to be done.&#xD;
"When you arrive, you call me out and take me to the office"&#xD;
the young man continued with a resolute, decisive tone, that&#xD;
showed exactly what he though was necessary and imparted that&#xD;
feeling to the others. "There we must first examine everything,&#xD;
before we decide upon our next steps. I am very much afraid,&#xD;
we shall make discoveries; that will prove, that this letter and the&#xD;
attempt on Mrs. Fox are not the only items of Mr. Wood's list&#xD;
of crimes. Mr. Fox have you had any breakfast this morning."&#xD;
"No Charlie, but I have no appetite whatever."&#xD;
"You must force yourself to eat a little nevertheless. Other-&#xD;
wise you too' would break down and goodness knows, we cannot&#xD;
spare you now. Come, dear Sir, I think mother has some break-&#xD;
.fast ready now. Cheer up; all may be well yet.""&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
WORSE AND WORSE.&#xD;
Mr. Fox suffered himself to be led into the house. Breakfast&#xD;
indeed was ready and the three sat down, to snatch a few morsels&#xD;
before going to the task, that had been resolved upon. Mr. Fox&#xD;
was first to go to the mansion and there relate the story concern-&#xD;
ing his wife's illness and afterwards make his appearance at the&#xD;
factory. The girls were to remain at the- cottage for the present&#xD;
and assist in nursing the patient. Mrs. Fuchs was able to give&#xD;
them all the comforting assurance that the condition of the suf-&#xD;
4erer was all that could be expected under the circumstances and&#xD;
that there was reasonable hope of recovery, provided undue ex&#xD;
excitement could be prevented from preying on her mind.&#xD;
They soon separated. Mr. Fox taking the way to the mansion,&#xD;
cast uneasy glances about him, to see whether people were&#xD;
already acquainted with his shame. A few people of the village&#xD;
passing him, greeted him with the usual salutation, but in his&#xD;
opinion their accent was ironical and their smile malignant. Pro-&#xD;
bably these persons looked and acted after their wonted fashion,;&#xD;

but his mood colored the visions of his eye, causing it to act like&#xD;
a prism which dyes the object, on which it casts its colored rays&#xD;
On reaching his house he noted an unusal stir and bustle&#xD;
amongst the servants. They knew, that something was wron&#xD;
and he shrank from the thought, that it was his province to giv&#xD;
the necessary explanations. Still he knew, that much depended&#xD;
on his looks and words and'going to the library he rang the bell.&#xD;
When Susan entered, he had tolerably well succeeded in banish-&#xD;
ing from his face all emotions excepting a sadness, which was but&#xD;
natural on the occasion.&#xD;
"Susan" he said "I want to speak to you. Take a chair; so&#xD;
and listen well to what I tell you, for I want you to communicate&#xD;
sad news to the others."&#xD;
Here Susan interrupted him. Clasping her hands together she&#xD;
exclaimed with a frightened voice:&#xD;
"O Mr. Fox, I knew it! I knew it! They wouldn'Ct believe me,&#xD;
when I told them, that something had befallen my mistress; but&#xD;
see it now from your face. Is she dead? is my&#xD;
dead?, is y poor mistr ess&#xD;
(lead?"&#xD;
"No, Susan, it is not as had as that; but what made you think&#xD;
so?"watmdyothn&#xD;
"Oh! when I knocked at her door this morning,&#xD;
not a bit of one. I tried again and again but ih  bette lu&#xD;
And then too I heard the bell in the night and noticed your  t-&#xD;
ting up and going away. I thought something was the matter&#xD;
ut when you came and took the young ladies away, I knew it for&#xD;
sure. Oh! Mrs. Fox is dead! my good mistress is dead onl y&#xD;
are afraid to tell me."                         ,oyou&#xD;
"Indeed Susan it is not so bad as that, Mr. Fox replied, evi-&#xD;
dently moved by the manifestation of an attachment, whichehe&#xD;
had not expected. "Still she is very sick, and there is no telling&#xD;
what may happen. Tell me, Susan, did you notice anything  u-&#xD;
usual in Mrs. Fox lately? any symptoms of sickness?"&#xD;
p                                 f Not to my knowledge, Sir, excepting may be, yesterday after-&#xD;
non. Mr. Wood called during your absence; but he didn't st&#xD;
ong and when Mrs. Fox went .up stairs, I thought she looked&#xD;
verish like. Yes, now I think of it, she did and then she com.&#xD;
fenced to pack the trunk, a thing she never did in all herclife.&#xD;
Ieed she must have been sick then, only we didn't think Of it.'&#xD;

"Yes, Susan, I think like you, she must have been very' sick&#xD;
even then and it is a great pity we dn't              t&#xD;
me, that she was very anxious about her dresses and would&#xD;
let her even touch them. She seemed to have the queer idea, that&#xD;
dn.atonehhesntto the&#xD;
the dresses needed altering and must at once be sent&#xD;
city."&#xD;
Indeed, Sir, and she did send them, a big trunk full.  John&#xD;
had to take it to town to Adam's express. She would call and&#xD;
see about it. he had to tell them."&#xD;
"And she did go, poor woman. We must have been strangely&#xD;
blind, not to see it coming. About midnight Mrs. Fox must&#xD;
have become delirious, for from what 'happened, afterwards, we&#xD;
know that she must have left the house about thtt time."&#xD;
"Good gracious! the darling woman! to leave the house at such&#xD;
an hour, alone and in a fever! It's a wonder, it didn't kill her!"&#xD;
"It came very near it, Susan, and may still, for all we know."&#xD;
"But where is she? where is she now?"&#xD;
"At the cottage, you know, Mr. Fuchs' house. We were at the&#xD;
parsone last-        t night and didn't get home till late. Mrs. Fuchs&#xD;
had some arrangements to make before retiring, and the clock&#xD;
struck twelve before she had got through. To-day is her wash-&#xD;
day and looking out, to see what kind of weather we might ex-&#xD;
pect, she noticed something white lying on the street. At first&#xD;
she thought it was a rag or something of that sort; but when she&#xD;
heard a moan, she knew it was a human being and running down,&#xD;
discovered Mrs. Fox. They were sorely frightened, you may&#xD;
well believe and so was I when they summoned me-to the bedside.&#xD;
I found the Doctor there, who told me it was a typhoid fever of&#xD;
the worst description. She didn't know me, nor the girls either&#xD;
this morning."&#xD;
"Oh dear! oh dear !" Susan exclaimed, "and there are no hopes&#xD;
of her recovery?"&#xD;
"Oh yes, she was a little better, when I left an  a  into&#xD;
a slumber. Still she may be sick for weeks, if she does recover&#xD;
and we couldn't think of moving her. So she'll remain at the&#xD;
cottage and the girls will be there too most of their time, to nurse&#xD;
ota   eaher and  keep her company."~&#xD;
"Oh how dreadful! how dreadful! The house will be like dead&#xD;
and we might as well go all away."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       197&#xD;
"Indeed we mightn't Susan. I shall be here and I expect&#xD;
everything to go on as usual,"&#xD;
"But may I go and see her, Sir?"&#xD;
"Not just at present Susan, The Doctor has ordered the strict-&#xD;
est seclusion and says the slightest excitement may-kill-her.. As&#xD;
n      er as she is ou t of danger, you may see her as often&#xD;
asyou please."                                        e&#xD;
"Thank you Sir and will you want any dinner to-day?"&#xD;
"Of course Susan; I expect to take my meals here. So, now&#xD;
you may go and tell.the others. See that they do not ask me&#xD;
any questions. It worries me and don't do your mistress any&#xD;
good."&#xD;
"So far, so good." Mr Fox said tohimself, as he left the house&#xD;
and took the direction to the factory.  "Still there ither&#xD;
task before m  n   evnkosoy            tl there is another&#xD;
S me and heaven knows, how I'll get through that."&#xD;
"Charlie can't you come to the office for a minute? I have a&#xD;
commission for you."&#xD;
Thus Mr. Fox voice rang through the building plainly heard&#xD;
by the hands, as it was intended that it should be.&#xD;
"Aye! aye! Sir." Charles responded, a load being&#xD;
mind at the saetm'rpo                a  eng, taken off his&#xD;
same time.  Mr. Wood was nowhere, and George&#xD;
was absent, and in spite of Mr. Fuchs' efforts to keep the machine&#xD;
in the track, it threatened to come to a still stand every minute.&#xD;
For that reason Charles felt greatly relieved  on hearing Mr. Fox'&#xD;
Voice and stepping briskly over the yrd, joined himin te o&#xD;
He closed and ocethdvrbey rJomdhmi the office.&#xD;
' c    and locked the door behind him, and then facing his&#xD;
companion, said :&#xD;
"'Twas high time for you to con; They keptamany&#xD;
questions, that my wit was near at an end."&#xD;
"And what do you propose to do, Charlie?"&#xD;
"That depends on the result of our investigation. Mr. Fox&#xD;
have you the keys of the safe ?"&#xD;
"Yes, there is a duplicate in my Possession-whydy a?"&#xD;
e"Wmipsssson-wydo you ask?"&#xD;
Will you please open the safe, then."&#xD;
Mr. Fox obeyed his injunction.&#xD;
"Now look for the money, or was there none ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Wood showed me drafts amounting to $10,000.00.&#xD;
"Aiy couCharles said with a sigh of relief "so much the better ;&#xD;

"But" Mr. Fox stammered "I think, he made me indorse them;&#xD;
He said he wanted money to pay off the hands."&#xD;
"That is bad" Charles responded. "Please look for them at&#xD;
once."&#xD;
Mr. Fox looked, but they had disappeared.&#xD;
"I thought -so!" Charles exclaimed.&#xD;
Mr. Fox however did not take it so cooly. He groaned and&#xD;
sank into a chair.&#xD;
"Eleven thousand dollars!"&#xD;
"I wonder it isn't more. It may be more for all we know.&#xD;
Come let us examine the books. A man is never ready to act,&#xD;
until he knows the worst."&#xD;
Mr. Fox assented. The books were run over and' in spite- of&#xD;
his dejection the owner could not help admiring the quick and&#xD;
comprehensive glance with which Charles took in the smallest&#xD;
details. In less than an hour the total lay before them. It was&#xD;
not at all flattering, but, as Charles had suggested worse, than&#xD;
Mr. Fox was prepared to expect.&#xD;
The hands in the factory had not been paid for nearly a month;&#xD;
pay-day was near at hand and no money in the treasury. But&#xD;
that was not all.  On close examination Charles found several&#xD;
letters of the firms, from which the factory was in the habit of&#xD;
receiving its steel. These letters contained polite but urgent re-&#xD;
quests to settle certain dues and after figuring up the various&#xD;
items they contained, Mr. Fox found himself indebted to the firm'&#xD;
for more than $10,000,00 This together witir the sum due to the&#xD;
laborers threatened to exceed his resources. The money had&#xD;
been there, to meet all these .contingencies; but the fraud of the&#xD;
superintendent had at once created a deficit of more than $24,000.00&#xD;
We need not wonder therefore, that Mr. Fox became more and&#xD;
more dejected and expressed to Charles his conviction of the&#xD;
uselessness of any efforts to stem the tide.&#xD;
"To make the cup full" he said "nothing but the appearance of&#xD;
the revenue officers is wanting. Indeed I shouldn't be surprised&#xD;
to see them enter this very moment.  Nor would I care.  My&#xD;
honor blighted, my credit gone: what does it matter, if my repu-&#xD;
tation as a law-abiding citizen is destroyed?"&#xD;
Charles was alarmed at this dejection. He could not help be-&#xD;
lieving, that Mr. Fox in his heart blamed, him to a certain degree&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
I 6&#xD;
&#xD;
and in a measure ascribed his misfortune to the young man's&#xD;
secrecy. If lie could only cheer him up, to hold out a few days&#xD;
until that fatal bar would be taken from him, then he would at&#xD;
least be able to justify his own conduct and maybe eve render&#xD;
Mr. Fox material assistance.&#xD;
"Now Mr. Fox this is downright wrong, you see. No good&#xD;
mariner will leave the vessel as long as he has the prospect of&#xD;
holding her planks together. Our case is not so bad as that.&#xD;
True, we have sprung a leak; but I am confident of our ability to&#xD;
stop it. Cheer up, sir! Excessive grief is neither manly nor exped-&#xD;
ient; it behooves us better to take measures to retrieve our fortune&#xD;
than to lay our hands in our lap and look the picture of despair."&#xD;
"But what would you do? I see no means of raising at short&#xD;
notice the large amount we owe.. Indeed by the bad manage-&#xD;
ment of the establishment my credit in the banks has already&#xD;
suffered and I see no chance of raising the necessary funds."&#xD;
"There is nothing like trying, Mr. Fox. Will y6u promise to&#xD;
make an effort?"&#xD;
"Yes Charlie, I will, but for that purpose, I'll have to pay a&#xD;
visit to our town, or, if necessary, even to the city. Before I leave&#xD;
however, I must take steps to install you in Mr. Wood's place."&#xD;
"Hadn't you better appoint myfather? It would look better&#xD;
and I could still assist him in all his measures."&#xD;
"Ithink you  re right, my boy.  Will you please call your&#xD;
father in ?"&#xD;
When Mr. Fuchs appeared, he was informed of what had hap-&#xD;
pened and what was to be done. In his timidity, he shrank from&#xD;
the great responsibility of his new position and only the thought&#xD;
of Charlie's assistance reconciled him to the arrangement.  The&#xD;
three were on the point of leaving the office and calling the&#xD;
hands together, to acquaint thep with the change; when Charles&#xD;
stopped the others, saying:&#xD;
"I never thought of it: shall we take no measures of bringing&#xD;
the runaways to justice? Perhaps we might be fortunate enough&#xD;
in such a case, to recover a portion of the booty."&#xD;
Mr. Fox shook his head.&#xD;
"I have thought of that" he said "but I have come to the con-&#xD;
elusion it would not answer for certain reasons, which I need but&#xD;
hint at. Mv wife's reputation is at the scoundrel's mercy and I&#xD;
&#xD;

200                    DOLORES.&#xD;
am afraid he would have little scruple, to threaten her, in order to&#xD;
secure impunity."&#xD;
Charles saw the subject pained him; so he abstained from touch.&#xD;
ing it again. All the hands were called together and informed of&#xD;
the new arrangement. There was some surprise of course and a&#xD;
good deal of envy and jealousy; but Mr. Fox took the proper&#xD;
course, of ignoring these manifestations and ordering a resump-&#xD;
tion of the work, as if no change had at all been made. From&#xD;
the factory he went to the, cottage, where no remarkable change&#xD;
had taken place. What little change there was however, was for&#xD;
the better and Mr. Fox felt inclined to share the hope of the girls&#xD;
and the family at. the cottage, that his wife would recover.&#xD;
Hope? did he really hope it? wouldn't it be a mercy for her, to&#xD;
find oblivion in the grave? would it not be a, mercy for him too?&#xD;
At times a bitterness of heart induced him to believe, that 'such&#xD;
an event would be acceptable, nay even agreeable to him; but at&#xD;
other times again he felt ahgry with himself aid persuaded..him&#xD;
self, that he would find no difficulty in verifying Mrs. Fuchs' pre-&#xD;
diction, namely, that he would readily pardon her great offense.&#xD;
Thus his, thoughts vacillated, when he left the cottage, to pay a&#xD;
final visit at the mansion. His adieu to his daughters had been&#xD;
short but fervent. A kiss, a Godspeed, a pressure of the hand&#xD;
and one parent had departed to leave them with another, who&#xD;
might also depart at any time, depart for another home, never to&#xD;
return.&#xD;
Those were solemn thoughts, that filled these young creatures,&#xD;
while they attended to the duties af the sick-room; nor did the&#xD;
meditations of the father differ niuch.from theirs. He and Lucy&#xD;
would have discovered great similarity of views, and ideas if an&#xD;
exchange could have, been made just then. Kind as Mr. Fox'&#xD;
easy disposition was,gentle as we have found Lucy to be-neither&#xD;
of them had the genuine charity which Dolores noble soul develop-&#xD;
ped towards the unfortunate woman. And yet she was the one,'&#xD;
that had been slighted-by the patient, she the recipient of many&#xD;
taunts direct and indirect, expressed and intimated. But her gen-&#xD;
lay prostrate on the sickbed, she had been the first, to approach&#xD;
erous heart had kept no record of her injuries and when her enemy&#xD;
her without a secret shudder at her pollution. Dolores hated si&#xD;
but she imitated the example of the founder of the Christian faith,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
who warned the people, not to condemn others, unless they felt&#xD;
themselves free from sin.&#xD;
And.--strange !-the patient seemed to feel, what her delirious&#xD;
mind was unfit to comprehend. She preferred the presence and&#xD;
assistance of Dolores to that f all others and appeared to find a&#xD;
great relief, when the girl aid her hand upon the temple, which&#xD;
burned with the rapid heat of a tumultuous blood. Strange in-&#xD;
deed! What a false perception, a willful blindness had kept&#xD;
asunder in the days of prosperity,.seemednow destined to be joined.&#xD;
together by the bitter but salutary lessons of adversity.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
A NEW'REIGN.&#xD;
After Mr. Fox had left, Charles seized the reins of government&#xD;
in the factory with a strong hand. While father and son endea-&#xD;
vored- to reconcile their former fellow laborers by kindness, to&#xD;
what they necessarily must consider as a great good fortune, they&#xD;
suffered on the other hand no encroachment on the prerogatives&#xD;
of the office. These were not theirs, but inherent to the place&#xD;
and it was Pot their business to introduce innovations, which&#xD;
might affect their successors. On the whole, they had less diffi-&#xD;
ulty, than they expected and this Mr. Fuchs rightly attributed&#xD;
to his son's influence. Charles was not. only liked, but he was&#xD;
also esteemed and--what goes farther with a certain class,-&#xD;
feared. He could knock down the ,best man in the factory and&#xD;
there were a few anecdotes in circulation, which showed, that he&#xD;
was very ticklish and quicker to strike, than was acceptable to&#xD;
parties, who thought of making something out of bulleying.&#xD;
Charles had received carte-blanche-indeed he would not have&#xD;
accepted the office on any other condition-and when Mr. Fox&#xD;
had departed, he at once adopted the policy, by which he had re-&#xD;
solved to be governed. Mr. Fuchs was satisfied with anything&#xD;
his son might suggest and so the first measure was carried into&#xD;
practice without delay. He sent word to about a dozen of the&#xD;
Oldest and most influential laborers in the factory requesting them&#xD;
to meet hi in the office. After they had entered and seated-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="202-208" xml:id="VAC7070-00000102"/>&#xD;

themselves, he communicated in concise, sharp outlines such fea-&#xD;
tures of the fraud, as he thought best for them to know.&#xD;
Wood and George-strange, now when he thought of it, he&#xD;
found, that the young man had never gone by any other name-&#xD;
h'ad defrauded Mr. Fox to the amount of many thousands, and&#xD;
crippled him sufficiently, to make the meeting of all dues a dif-&#xD;
cult matter. Mr. Fox he said had gone away to raise the neces-&#xD;
sary funds, but times were dull; the war in Italy had brought on&#xD;
a crises and money was scarce. Now, in case Mr. Fox should not&#xD;
succeed in getting enough to satisfy everybody-lie wanted to&#xD;
know, whether they would be willing, to do a little for their em-&#xD;
ployer by giving him some time and inducing their fellow work-&#xD;
men, to do the same? He was their benefactor and the benefac-&#xD;
tor of the village and the man that could point out any injury he&#xD;
ever received from Mr. Fox, was yet to make his appearance.&#xD;
It was a perfect little speech, he made thereand it was well re-&#xD;
ceived. The sturdy fellows wtth their blackened hands and faces&#xD;
declared, that Mr. Fox needn't fret on their account and that&#xD;
they would say the same thing for theirpomrades. He hadgiven&#xD;
them a chance to lay by a little and they could get along well&#xD;
enouh, even if payments should be postponed for a month or two.&#xD;
They thanked Charles for his confidence and the chance he had&#xD;
given them, to show, how much they thought of their generous&#xD;
employer.&#xD;
"So far, so good" said Charles to his father after the delegates&#xD;
had left the office. "That is one slip farther from the track. But&#xD;
what is this?"                (&#xD;
He had taken a letter, which with other mail matter had arrived&#xD;
a little while ago. "Ha! George's handwriting! Listen father,&#xD;
to what the scoundrel h .ts to say. I bet he is going to sell his&#xD;
partner.&#xD;

guess) to participate in an act, which never had my approbatt nt&#xD;

of my. ability. I hold in my hands valuable papers, which are of&#xD;

feels very much at home at such a place)-a place, of which you&#xD;
have doubtless heard. I shall give you time to the end of this&#xD;
week. If you fail to call at the rendez vous until then; I shall&#xD;
construe your nonappearance into a refusal of my offer and at&#xD;
once make use of the papers in a way, that ,  must result in your&#xD;
employer's ruin.                       Yours respectfully&#xD;
(thank you, sir, I'd rather be despised by the like of you) GEORGE.&#xD;
'-George Nobody" Charles exclaimed, waxing warm "or rather&#xD;
George Arnold; for every other- name is too good for such a trai-&#xD;
torg."&#xD;
"And you think, lie holds the paper, which Wood mentioned&#xD;
in the letter, you found before our house?"&#xD;
"Of course lie does. He cannot know that we see through his&#xD;
trick; for I am sure lie has not the least idea of the other letter."&#xD;
Wod evidently wrote it, because he did not trust his own ac-&#xD;
complice and we would never got a sight of it, if it hadn't been&#xD;
for that fortunate accident last night."&#xD;
"Charles!" his father admonished reproachfc&#xD;
call fortunate, what put a human life in jeopardy?"&#xD;
"W hy not, father? Is it not better that she should have broken&#xD;
her husbands heart and ruined his rep it  n i&#xD;

escaped a fearful destiny with the slight penalty of a  w week's&#xD;
confinement I(1 not bear her any grudge, father, indeed I&#xD;
nthe contrary, I hope sincerely, that this accident Will&#xD;
prove a salutary lesson for the future."&#xD;
"Amen !" Mr. Fuchs struck in. "But you have forgotten to&#xD;
l            mean to do in regard to this communication?"&#xD;
"Disregard it of course. On Sunday my time is up and then&#xD;
never mind father ! trust me another week, and all will come out&#xD;
ht. For the present it is sufficient, that a second cloud has&#xD;
mercifully passed us, without sending the destructive thunder-&#xD;
lt. ie will be safe from the revenue officers unless Wood&#xD;
should deem proper to write another letter, which I deem rather&#xD;
improbable. The failure of the attempt to abduct Mrs. Foe&#xD;
must have been a serious shock to him and may debar him from&#xD;
hostile acts; How he must have hated Mr. Fox, to do,&#xD;
him so much injury !"&#xD;

"I think he did hate him and your mother actually warned Mr.&#xD;
Fox a couple of years ago. But he paid no heed to it, and there-I&#xD;
fore must now pay the penalty. He took it too light and so&#xD;
you-pardon me, for saying that -much-and it gives me much&#xD;
annoyance to think that you-though unintentionallyshould&#xD;
have contributed to his ruin."&#xD;
Charlesremained unmoved.&#xD;
"Father" he said "would it not be a little more charitable, to&#xD;
wait awhile before pronouncing judgment on my actions? I  need&#xD;
but say a word, to clear me of your accusations, but it is against&#xD;
my conscience to say that word and I shall leave it unsaid."&#xD;
"Beit so Charlie! be it so!" the father answered, eagerly dI take&#xD;
your word, as readily as the best evidence you might produce.&#xD;
Are there any new measures you contemplate?"&#xD;
"None, father, just now. We must work up the raw material&#xD;
judiciously, neither too fast, nor too slowly. We do not know,&#xD;
how soon Mr. Fox will send a new supply and yet it would not&#xD;
do, to stop the hands or dismiss a few. We must avoid every-&#xD;
thing, that might create dissatisfaction."&#xD;
"That is true, Charlie. Fortunately we have enough on hand&#xD;
to do us 3 or 4 weeks. In the mean time Mr. Fox will likely&#xD;
send us more."&#xD;
"Exactly father" Charles said with a brightening countenance&#xD;
" or I make a big haul of" which you little dream. No questions&#xD;
Sir, no questions! I could not answer them."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
LOVE DAWNING--LOVE WANING.&#xD;
In the cottage things went their quiet way. No noise was heard&#xD;
from roof to cellar and silence thickened and became tangible in&#xD;
and near the sick-chamber. None but the Doctor and the ladies&#xD;
were allowed admittance and even of them never more than two&#xD;
at the time. The patient grew better and worse or rather her re-&#xD;
covery was interrupted and retarded by spells of fever, which&#xD;
would return at regular intervals. At such hours the task. of&#xD;
nursing her was not very easy. It did not only strain the body&#xD;
-for at times the patient had to be retained on the bed b  i-&#xD;
cation of physical force--but also the mind. To listen to the&#xD;
ravings of the giddy brain, the incessant harping on the sinful&#xD;
love, that had caused the flight and.sickness; the passionate ap-&#xD;
peals to her seducer, to release her from her.bonds and the sad re-&#xD;
proaches of a guilty conscience--all these things could not be&#xD;
listened too, without a shock upon the hearer's mind. Lucy was&#xD;
evidently sinking under it. One day coming from the room, she&#xD;
threw herself into Dolores' arms and burst into such a flood of&#xD;
passionate tears, that both Dolores and Mrs. Fuchs became&#xD;
alarmed. The gentle, even disposition of the girl was so foreign&#xD;
to these passionate gusts,,that on their appearance her friends&#xD;
could not but apprehend a serious derangement of her nervous&#xD;
system.&#xD;
"I cannot stand it any longer" she cried amidst her, sobs in-&#xD;
deed I cannot. When I hear her wild appeals to that wicked man&#xD;
her earnest supplications of forgiveness I feel as if I sat in judg-&#xD;
ment over her. I try to bend my heart to sympathy and compas-&#xD;
sion; but oh Dolores, I cannot break myself to feelings of indul-&#xD;
gence and, forgiveness. Do not let me go into that room an&#xD;
longer, or I shall lose the control of my reason-yes, grow insane&#xD;
without even the hope of recovery."&#xD;
"Still Lucy !" Dolores now addressed her, drawing the quiver-&#xD;
ing form nearer to her heart and stroking with a gentle hand the&#xD;
disheveled hair. "Say nothing more at present- andweep away&#xD;
the load, that threatens to overpower your strength. I understand&#xD;
you, child and pity you. Oficourse, you must not watch in that&#xD;
room any longer just at present, at least not when she wanders&#xD;
&#xD;

in her fever. Leave that to me Lucy and to Mrs Fuchs; you can&#xD;
do a thousand little things out here and in the kitchen, that willbe&#xD;
just as welcome as your vigils in the sick-room. Indeed, if you&#xD;
had not been so stubborn on your coming, you might have been&#xD;
spared this trial."&#xD;
"Oh Dolores!" Lucy answered, raising her head a little "I had&#xD;
no idea what it is, to sit in judgment over a fallen mother. Don't&#xD;
,don't these ravings ever shock you ?"&#xD;
"They shock my reason without influencing my heart. I am&#xD;
far from feeling any aversion to your poor mother, Lucy, I rather&#xD;
love her better than before; for I pity her from the bottom of my&#xD;
heart and compassion engenders affection. Perhaps it is selfish-&#xD;
ness, that makes me feel so; perhaps I feel a satisfaction to see&#xD;
her descending from that cold reserve, that distant coldness, to&#xD;
which there was no chance of access. If Mrs. Fox recovers,-&#xD;
and there is no more doubt of it, I think-I hope to find an ave-&#xD;
nue to her heart and induce her to receive me in the same affec-&#xD;
tion with which our good father regards me."&#xD;
"And you can really forget, that she. ..." Lucy hesitated. She&#xD;
seemed impossible for her to clothe her thought in words.&#xD;
"Stop, Lucy" Dolores reproached her somewhat sternly "it&#xD;
surely is not your province, to sit in judgment on your mother's&#xD;
failings. To you she . has always been a good and indulging&#xD;
mother. But it isn't my kind and gentle Lucy, that speaks; it is&#xD;
a foreign voice engendered by this overworking of your mind and&#xD;
body. Just rest yourself a while and I am sure these sickly,&#xD;
overstrained notions will vanish of themselves and instead of&#xD;
grieving on your injuries you will thank a kind dispensation 1r&#xD;
its timely interference."I&#xD;
Lucy did not reply; but from the lowered brow and compress-&#xD;
sed lips it was evident, that she was as yet incapable of appreci&#xD;
ting the spirit of her sister's remarks. When Mrs. Fuchs came&#xD;
out a moment afterwards, Dolores stated Lucy's wishes to her&#xD;
and that motherly friend at once consented to the change. Indeed,&#xD;
she was glad of it and without delay took Lucy to the kitchen 1n&#xD;
order to assign her task, that would employ her hands, without&#xD;
taxing her brain, The young lady was not a very expert hand&#xD;
in this new sphere, as her mother had made her form the notion.&#xD;
that work of such a rough description was rather below&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       207&#xD;
dignity; but she was willing and under Mr1s. Fuchs guidance did&#xD;
well enough.&#xD;
In the mean time Dolores had taken ner  position att&#xD;
bed. This was the hour, when Mrs. Fox was at the height of fever&#xD;
and must be watched with double care. Dolores seemed intended&#xD;
for such Samaritan office, for she went to work so quietly, so un-&#xD;
obstrusively, that many an older nurse might have learned from&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Here! here! give me your hand!" the patient cried, fumbling&#xD;
eagerly with her nervous fingers. "So, that does good; it stops&#xD;
the fire within me. Lay the other on my head; lay it on,  stops&#xD;
Ha! how that cools! You know I am doomed to burn; yes, burn&#xD;
forever, because I listened to the serpent and tasted of  s buit&#xD;
that is forbidden. Burn! burn! burn! =ah! to burn forever:uis&#xD;
that thought not horrible? Away! let go. let go, I wantorow:s&#xD;
myself in cooling water! Oh! water! water!"&#xD;
"Yes here is water, mother; come let me lift your head, that&#xD;
you may drink with greater ease. Dos it refresh you "&#xD;
"Yes it does, it does; but who are you, that takes such compas-&#xD;
sion on one that's doomed? You are an angel, are yo  'pos-&#xD;
"No, madam, I am far from being one. I am onlDolore-&#xD;
dont you know Dolores?"                                es:&#xD;
"Yes I do know her; but you ain't Dolores. Dolores is&#xD;
at the judgment seat, to testify against me. Oh so much tes&#xD;
mony will crush me! They will heap more fire upon me    -&#xD;
fire! more fire!"um, more&#xD;
Again Dolores had to hold the patient, until the fever abated&#xD;
and total relaxation followed the unnatural excitement- Mrs.&#xD;
Fox lay with closed eyes and her breathing was so faint as to be&#xD;
hardly perceptible. Yet Dolores could not withdraw her had&#xD;
When she made a motion for that purpose, the weary lids o th&#xD;
sufferer opened a little and a supplicating glance expressed wha&#xD;
language could not.&#xD;
Thus several days passed off, bringing only the slightest changes&#xD;
of improvement. Finally on the fourth one the Doctor declared&#xD;
er out of danger. "The crisis set in last night" he  d "andta&#xD;
ood constitution and your excellent care have -caused the scale&#xD;
fe to sink. The fever is over and the patient will no doubt re-&#xD;
tn to consciousness and coherent talk. But the danger is by&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="208" xml:id="VAC7070-00000105"/>&#xD;
no means entirely past. She will ask numerous questions,-'which&#xD;
must be answered with great discretion; for the slightest shock,&#xD;
an excitement or fright may bring on a relapse, which would cer-&#xD;
tainly be fatal. It will be best, to let only Dolores be about her&#xD;
for a while."&#xD;
"Would not Lucy answer better?" Mrs. Fuchs inquired "her&#xD;
face is more familiar."&#xD;
"That may all be; but I have noticed, that the presence of Dol-&#xD;
ores has something soothing to the patient, and we ought to take&#xD;
the hints of nature in preference to our own opinion. No, let Dol-&#xD;
ores stay with her and I guarantee that all will soon be well."&#xD;
"But Dolores is going to kill herself with this everlasting watch-&#xD;
ing Doctor: don't you see, how thin she looks?"&#xD;
"Never mind my looks aunty" Dolores answered with a laugh,&#xD;
that was fresh. enough under the circumstances "I am not the&#xD;
least fatigued and can stand it a good while longer. Pst, she is&#xD;
stirring. You talk .to the Doctor, I Inust go in.".&#xD;
When she took her seat at the bedside, she thought she noticed&#xD;
a profuse perspiration on the foreheadf the patient. At this she&#xD;
greatly rejoiced since the Doctor had said that every thing would&#xD;
go right, if only that symptom would make its appearance. She&#xD;
drew the cover higher on the body of the convalescent to keep&#xD;
her warm and promote the perspiration. While she was doing&#xD;
this with her head and shoulders bent over the bed, Mrs. Fox&#xD;
opened her eyes. For the first time they looked clearly and intel&#xD;
ligently wandering over the room and at last adhering to thelovely&#xD;
countenance bending over her., She smiled and with feeble accent&#xD;
asked:&#xD;
"Dol, is that you?"&#xD;
The girl's eye shone with radiance. Never before had.Mrs. Fox&#xD;
called her that familiar name. She nodded in reply, looking ex-&#xD;
tremely happy and casting as it were the reflection of her rosy&#xD;
countenance on the pale cheeks of 'the patient. Mrs.'Fox closed&#xD;
her eyes again-perhaps she was unable to stand so much light&#xD;
all at once-but only for a minute. Opening them a second time.&#xD;
"Whereg I?"&#xD;
"With friends, dear madam, who rejoice at your recovery."&#xD;
"I have been sick?"&#xD;
"Yes madam."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
208,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="-209" xml:id="VAC7070-00000106"/>&#xD;
"Very sick?'&#xD;
"The doctor tells us so; but you are past all danger now-indeed&#xD;
the doctor said you would be free of fever."&#xD;
"Good girl! but this is not my room-where am I?"&#xD;
Mrs. Fox' look expressed some anguish and therefore Dolores&#xD;
hastened to reply:&#xD;
"Amongst your friends, dear' madam. Let that suffice you,&#xD;
come ask no more questions now. tHere take a sip of this cool-&#xD;
ing lemonade I have prepared for you. So, that will do!  Now&#xD;
close your eyes and sleep, I'll keep you company."&#xD;
With one hand she stroked the patient's face closing the weary&#xD;
eyes, that yielded readily to the kind persuasion; and with the&#xD;
other took and held the emaciated fingers. Soon the soothing&#xD;
influence stole over the weakene d frame. The eyes closed more&amp;amp;&#xD;
firmly, the breath increased in strength, and the bosom rose and&#xD;
fell-in regular tempo. A mysterious fluid, which the physicians&#xD;
call with learned names, but which is nevertheless a mystery to&#xD;
them, emanated from the point of the nurse's fingers and creep-&#xD;
ing along the thousand nerves of the convalescent, imparted to&#xD;
them new tone and vigor. Mrs. Fox slept soundly for more than&#xD;
an hour and mean while Dolores hadtto sit perfectly still and con-&#xD;
tinue sending the stream of life in gentle waves 'all over the feeble&#xD;
body. At length the patient awoke again and this time at once&#xD;
sent out her glance in search of her nurse. Having found her,&#xD;
she let it dwell upon her face with so much love and fervor, that&#xD;
it went into the girl's innermost heart, and filled it with a rapture,&#xD;
that made her feel like shouting with delight. Still she remained&#xD;
perfectly quiet, until Mrs Fox began:&#xD;
"Doi, tell me, where I am, I feel strong enough to hear it."&#xD;
Dolores reflected a second.  By hesitating she would excite&#xD;
the patient more than by a prompt statement of the truth. If&#xD;
Mrs. Fox should try to make deductions and further inquiries, it&#xD;
would still be time, to check her and advance the Doctor's pos-&#xD;
itive orders as a screen behind which she might retreat. So she-&#xD;
frankly answered :&#xD;
"You are at the cottage, madam, you know, Mr. Fuchs' resi-&#xD;
dence."&#xD;
"But how. . .."&#xD;
"How you got there, you mean? That is hard to tell.  You&#xD;

must have wandered from our house, in a fever, for you were&#xD;
found insensible=at the gate here. The Doctor was summoned&#xD;
without delay and pronounced your malady a typhoid fever." '&#xD;
Mrs. Fox listened as if in a dream. Slowly her memory began&#xD;
to act and she gained a dim vison of the past.  But that state-&#xD;
ment of Dolores ? Was she deceived or trying to deceive? Firmly&#xD;
her gaze fastened upon the girl's features; but Dolores knew, what&#xD;
was at stake and with heroic courage stood the test.  Mrs. Fox&#xD;
seemed satisfied; a sigh of relief escaped her bosom, and dismis-&#xD;
sing a vague apprehension she delivered herself solely to the new&#xD;
love that had suddenly sprung up within her bosom. Tears started&#xD;
to her eyes, welling up spontaneously from her heart and she&#xD;
tried to lift her arms, as if she wanted to fold the girl in her em-&#xD;
brace.- But she was too weak and the name of her nurse, feebly&#xD;
whispered was all the manifestation she was able to make.  But&#xD;
the language of love speaks eloquently even in whispers, and no&#xD;
sooner had Dolores heard her name, when, sinking on her knees&#xD;
before the bed, she kissed the emaciated hands and said:&#xD;
"Dear Mrs. Fox, what do you wish? what can I do for you?"&#xD;
"I want you, to call me mother."&#xD;
"My mother!"&#xD;
deep emotion prevented both from speaking; but when Dol-&#xD;
ores had sufficiently recovered, she all at once was frightened at&#xD;
the thought, that this might be injurious to the patient. So she&#xD;
arose and with a beseeching look said to her newly gained friend:&#xD;
"Please be calm now! This is all wrong and Doctor Palmer&#xD;
will scold me for neglecting-his directions. This excitement will&#xD;
injure you, mother."&#xD;
Poor child! she wanted to cure the patient from the intoxica-&#xD;
tion under which she labored and yet continued to apply the sti-&#xD;
mulant.&#xD;
Mrs. Fox shook her head with a happy smile :&#xD;
"Fear nothing, Dol," she said "this will not hurt me, darling.&#xD;
It is a medicine, that will promote my convalescence: 1 feel it&#xD;
does me good."&#xD;
"So much the better, mther; but now it is enough and you&#xD;
must sleep again. Here is your medicine ; it is time to take it;&#xD;
So! now sleep yourself well; I shall not leave, you for a moment."&#xD;
Mi's. Fox obeyed her like a child. Holding Dolores' hand- as&#xD;
&#xD;
firmly, as her feeble strength permitted, she closed&#xD;
soon once more slumbered towards new heatherd h  eyes and&#xD;
yes towards a new life. Poor Dolores had t  - an  frh. .&#xD;

in oblivion, the measures of Dolores were calculated to support&#xD;
he'-Mrs. Fuchs had sanctioned 'them and promised to inform&#xD;
Lucy and induce her, to conceal from her mother any emotions&#xD;
calculated to destroy her assurance. As yet however Dolores did&#xD;
not know, how Mrs. Fuchs had succeeded and this uncertainty&#xD;
induced her to dely a meeting, which might result disastrously.&#xD;
So she said:&#xD;
"She must not see you for a little while yet; the Doctor thinks&#xD;
an interview with her might. excite and therefore injure you. The&#xD;
Doctor's veto is the patient's law, you kncw mother and you must&#xD;
submit to it. To-morrow you may be strong enough to see your&#xD;
daughter.".&#xD;
After finishing, Dolores awaited the reply of Mrs. Fox with a&#xD;
beating heart. What if she should fret? if she should insist upon&#xD;
an interview, before the wounded feelings of her daughter had had&#xD;
time to heal? She was therefore greatly relieved, when the pat-&#xD;
ient with evident indifference acquiesced in the decision and&#xD;
merely said :&#xD;
"As you please, child; but I am hungry, very hungry."&#xD;
"Oh! you shall eat, mother, of course you shall.. Just allow&#xD;
me, to step to the door and call Mrs. Fuchs."&#xD;
This was done and a minute afterwards the hostess entered&#xD;
with a little dish containing the promised nourishment.&#xD;
"Here is your soup, my dear madam" she said without any in-&#xD;
troduction, acting as if the presence of the convalescent in her&#xD;
house was a matter of course. "Dol sit on the bed and support&#xD;
the head of Mrs. Fox, while I feed her with the spoon."&#xD;
"That is the way with sick folks" she continued with a pleas-&#xD;
ant smile "they are like little children and have to be fed. They&#xD;
cry too, sometimes, when they dont get, what they want; but as&#xD;
with the children, their crying makes us happy, because it indicates&#xD;
the change, the return to health and strength. How do you like&#xD;
your soup, madam?"&#xD;
"It is so good; and you are good and kind, Mrs. Fuchs. I&#xD;
must have caused you great annoyance."&#xD;
"Tut! tut! don't say a word about it now, unless you want to&#xD;
make me scold you. The little trouble is of no account com-&#xD;
pared with the happiness it gives me, to see you recover under&#xD;
my hands, as it were."&#xD;
&#xD;
The patient smiled; but when she wanted to speak, Mrs. Fuchs&#xD;
checed er saying :&#xD;
"Just you lie still, dear madam, and don't s&#xD;
you to get well right.fast and, to secure that object, must insist oa&#xD;
rest and sleep. Do you think, you could get a nap after your lit-&#xD;
tie meal?",ganaafeyorit&#xD;
"I'll try."&#xD;
And she did' try and soon her regular breathing indicated a&#xD;
sound slumber. Dolores also caught a little sleep;1 lning ic k&#xD;
in a rockingchair, the patient's hand still enclosed in hers, she&#xD;
y an   slept till near midnight, when the voice of Mrs F&#xD;
aroused her. She straightened up with a start and the look sh&#xD;
cast upon the patient bore an expression of anxiety. Still  e&#xD;
thing was right.&#xD;
"I am sorry to disturb you, Dol; but I   -&#xD;
would you please reach me a little water ?"&#xD;
"Of course I will and I a1m sorry, that I suffered myself to be&#xD;
'overcome by sleep."&#xD;
"I am not sorry, Dol, for I fear you are wearing your strength&#xD;
away by these incessant vi-gls. But I hope I shall soon be well&#xD;
now and then we shall change relations and I shall nurse you as&#xD;
you have never been nursed before."&#xD;
"But I don't want to get sick."&#xD;
"Nor do I want you to; but I shall nurse you sick or not&#xD;
sick; I shall try to seebwhether I cannot spoil you a little bit.&#xD;
To tell you the truth, ol, it has always worried mt, to see you&#xD;

&#xD;
She kissed the patient repeatedly and in her embraces Mrs. Fox&#xD;
passed over into'the land of dreams.&#xD;
On the morning her improvement was even more visible. She&#xD;
repeatedly asked for her daughter Lucy and Dolores went in&#xD;
search of her, in order to ascertain, whether it would be safe to"&#xD;
allow an interview. Lucy's swollen eyes showed, that she had&#xD;
wept mu'ch; but Dolores found her much more calm and resigned,&#xD;
and in answer to her inquiry received the assurance that she felt&#xD;
strong enough to see her mother.&#xD;
The girl was an enigma to Dolores. She wondered, that one.&#xD;
so feeble in intellect, so free from passions should show so pas-&#xD;
sionate a repugnance to the manifestations of weakness in others.&#xD;
She did not know the world; if she had, she would have learned,&#xD;
that it is not the character of little minds, to be tolerant and in-&#xD;
dulgent. The greater the soul; the wider the scope of vision and&#xD;
thought, the greater also the virtues of generosity and magnan-&#xD;
imity.&#xD;
"Come then" Dolores said to her "your mother wants to see&#xD;
you. Recollect however, that on your firmness her whole chance&#xD;
of future happiness depends. Show yourself weak, and you will&#xD;
doubtless plunge her into a sea of trouble and wretchedness, that&#xD;
may only cease with her life."&#xD;
"I can bear to see her, Dolores," Lucy replied and, indeed, the&#xD;
girl's countenance bore the stamp of greater resolution, than one&#xD;
was wont to see there.&#xD;
When the two entered the chamber, Mrs. Fox stretched her&#xD;
hands towards them.&#xD;
"My daughters! both my daughters !" she said as ardently as&#xD;
her weakness would allow. "I praise myself happy indeed, that&#xD;
by grievous affliction I was enabled to increase the number of my&#xD;
children."&#xD;
Neither of the girls spoke a word in reply. Dolores .knelt at&#xD;
the bedside, drawing 'down her rather unwilling companion.&#xD;
Once there however and her mother's hand resting upon her head,&#xD;
Lucy found tears, and wee-rftng bitterly felt the chill of her&#xD;
heart melting away with the copious stream that rolled down her&#xD;
cheeks. Fortunately Mrs. Fox attributed her daughter's tears to&#xD;
the anguish of the days of danger now past, and stroking her&#xD;
golden curls, tried to comfort her:&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
25&#xD;
&#xD;
"Don't, Lucy" she said "our friends here tel me, that i am&#xD;
getting well and I know from my feelings, that they do not de-&#xD;
ceive me. Cheer up then, darling, and show by a joyful counten-&#xD;
ance that you rejoice at your mother's recovery."&#xD;
But Lucy could not persuade herself, to go that far. To smile&#xD;
would be as much as saying, that she was glad and happy, and in&#xD;
her uncharitable mood such a deception did not seem justifiable&#xD;
to her. To stop her weeping was all she managed to accomplish&#xD;
and the rigid features of her countenance might have struck even&#xD;
Mrs. Fox as something strange, if she had not always been ac-&#xD;
customed 'to a negative affection in her daughter and if on the&#xD;
other hand Dolores had not attracted her attention in an unusual&#xD;
degree. So the interview passed off without any evil consequen-&#xD;
ces, Dolores excusing Lucy's withdrawal on the plea of house-&#xD;
hold affairs, and Mrs. Fox accepting the excuse with a coolness&#xD;
rather unacountable to the foster-daughter, When Lucy left the&#xD;
room, a new feeling had nestled in her heart, a feeling so bitter&#xD;
and tantalizing, that she would gladly have exchanged it for the&#xD;
previous coldness. Perhaps, she could not have defined it her-&#xD;
self, if any persons had asked her questions ; but one that knows&#xD;
the human heart and has had sufficient experience in the fickle-&#xD;
ness and utter inconsistency of emotions, would without hesita-&#xD;
tion have told us, that jealousy had struck its poisonous fangs&#xD;
into Lucy's bosom. Jealousy? how is that possible? We are&#xD;
aware, that jealousy begrudges the participation in a boon we&#xD;
value highly,--but can we also fall a prey to that passion, if a&#xD;
stranger shares with' us the affection of a party, we little love?&#xD;
The case of Lucyseems to answer in the a rmative and we can&#xD;
but wonder at this strange contradiction of her feelings. Or&#xD;
could'it be barely possible; that her mother's love again rose in&#xD;
her estimation in proportion as she saw the danger of a stranger's&#xD;
appropriating to herself the fairest portion? Children often&#xD;
value toys, because other children possess them, and for the same&#xD;
reason covet things, which they themselves had frequently rejected&#xD;
with disdain.&#xD;
In one respect Lucy was a child; but this new passion took&#xD;
away from her the harmlessness of a child. Alas ! poor Dolores&#xD;
little dreamed, that she only gained a mother's love at the ex-&#xD;
pense of a sister's affection.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
THE CAVE AGAIN.&#xD;
Four days had passed without bringing Mr. Fox or even a. let-&#xD;
ter or dispatch from him. The convalescent had been cautiously. -&#xD;
informed of her husband's absence and the communication had&#xD;
evidently much more affected her, than the first interview with her&#xD;
daughter. Still she received in resignation the daily reports- of&#xD;
his prolonged absence and made it difficult for her friends to learn&#xD;
whether she looked with fear or hope towards the hour of re-&#xD;
union.&#xD;
Not so Charles. He had cause to wish Mr. Fox' presence for&#xD;
many reasons. Letters of importance were received every day,&#xD;
that had to be answered without delay, and Charles began to un-&#xD;
derstand, that the management of such an establishment requires&#xD;
something' more than mere energy and intelligence ; to be success-&#xD;
ful, the manager must have experience and that qualification time&#xD;
alone can give. Fortunately his father had this requirement in a&#xD;
high degree, and under ordinary circumstances the partnership&#xD;
might have answered very well. But the whole mechanism had&#xD;
got out of order by Wood's fault and Mr. Fuchs regularly shrank&#xD;
from measures, which his judgment had acknowledged as equally&#xD;
necessary and daring. The fact, that they had not made the cir-&#xD;
cumstances and that the circumstances left not the shadow of a&#xD;
choice, did not console Mr. Fuchs much and he labored under&#xD;
his responsibility like a vessel, that carries too great a pressure&#xD;
of canvass on a disproportionate mast.&#xD;
But if, for his father's sake, Charles was anxious to see Mr. Fox&#xD;
return, with a pocket full of money, to satisfy pressing creditors,&#xD;
he had within himself a romantic element, which delighted in ex-&#xD;
traordinary situations and looked for channels of assistance&#xD;
which the ordinary world would have ridiculed. The diary of&#xD;
his female ancestors and the letter of Eberhardt, containing the&#xD;
allusion to a testament had never entirely deserted his mind. Even&#xD;
in the pressure of business, Charles saw tempting visions danc-&#xD;
ing before his mental eye and it was only by a firm resolve, that&#xD;
he banished them  sufficiently to allow him, to attend to other&#xD;
and more important matters. His excitement of course increased&#xD;
as the day approached, that freed him from all obligations ofQ&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
secrecy. The evening before he had found an opportunity to&#xD;
whisper to Dolores, that he wanted her company for the afternoon&#xD;
of the next day. But wanting and obtaining are two different&#xD;
things; so Charles thought best, to take the matter in his own&#xD;
hands and work it to the desired issue.&#xD;
"Mother" he said after supper "it is a shame the way you con-&#xD;
fine Dolores to the sickroom."&#xD;
"But Charlie, Mrs. Fox will not let her go; she seems to be un-&#xD;
able to get along without her."&#xD;
"If she is no more reasonable, she will have to do. without her;&#xD;
for this constant strain will make her sick. As long as Mrs. Fox&#xD;
was in danger, I didn't object taking the absolute necessity as a&#xD;
consolation. But now she is out of danger and I do object de-&#xD;
cidedly."&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs smiled.&#xD;
"Charlie, what are you driving at? Why dont you come for-&#xD;
ward like a man and tell your mother, what you want?"&#xD;
Charles blushed lightly.&#xD;
"Want?" lie said s'nothing particularly, but I want Dolores to&#xD;
have air and exercise."&#xD;
,"And propose for that purpose...."&#xD;
"A boat ride on the ocean. I know she likes that well...."&#xD;
"And I know, that fr. Charles likes that well and that I was&#xD;
rglit in thinking, that some selfish motive was liing at the bot-&#xD;
tom of all this philanthropic talk."&#xD;
Charles had to laugh in spite of himself.&#xD;
"You are too smart for me, mother" lie said. "But supposing&#xD;
you were right, I dont see that alters the case any. Dol needs&#xD;
air and.exercise and it matters little, in whose company she enjoys&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"You are right Charlie and I'll try to second you in this affair&#xD;
When do you want Dol?"&#xD;
"To-morrow, after dinner. I could not well be absent from the&#xD;
factory a whole day."&#xD;
"Nor she from the cottage."&#xD;
"Well then, let us have the afternoon. But mind, I want no&#xD;
company; neither Henry nor uncle Jacob."&#xD;
"That is a pity, Jacob is getting so bothersome in the house, I&#xD;
would gladly spare him for a whole day."&#xD;

"Well if you. promise to' disengage Dolores I shall free you&#xD;
froth uncle Jacob for a whole day. All I have to do, is to send&#xD;
him on a fool's errand."&#xD;
"Be careful how to treat him Charlie. He is yonr father's,&#xD;
brother and though not examplary in every thing entitled to&#xD;
.respect."&#xD;
"Oh! I respect him hugely! So much indeed that I would&#xD;
never come to near him if I could help it. Still he must be borne&#xD;
with that is a fact. He knows all the circumstances of Mrs. Fox',&#xD;
sickbed and could to her infinite harm, if he chose to set his&#xD;
tongue in motion."&#xD;
"True enough! I never thought of that: a double reason to&#xD;
treat him with due caution."&#xD;
"I shall be careful, mother. But he is very intimate with Henry,&#xD;
if any mischief is brewing, it surely will spring from this union&#xD;
of two kindred spirits."&#xD;
"You are hard on your brother."~&#xD;
"I cannot help it, mother. It makes me impatient to think of&#xD;
that lazy goodfornothing drone. I wonder where he got his love&#xD;
of idleness. It surely is neither in you nor in father-he must&#xD;
have got it from his uncle."&#xD;
"    oMao be he has, I am glad you mention this matter, for I shall&#xD;
now have my eyes upon them."&#xD;
"It will do no harm, mother; though for the present I have&#xD;
managed to secure uncle Jacob's sympathy in our behalf, Unless&#xD;
eandseit his advantage to secure my enmity, he will be careful&#xD;
to abstain from all gossip in regard to Mrs. Fox I forbade him,&#xD;
even to make Henry his confident."&#xD;
"The conversation closing, Mrs. Fuchs went to the sickroom,&#xD;
for the purpose of recognizing the ground and making prepara-&#xD;
tions- for a general assault upon the fortress. An hour after-&#xD;
vards she returned and made Charles happy with the assurance&#xD;
that the excursion had already been decided upon, and that other&#xD;
circumstances being favorable the convalescent would hardly raise&#xD;
any objections.&#xD;
In consequence of this communication Charles without delay&#xD;
entered upon an activity, that was as noiseless as efficient. Going&#xD;
no his workshop he secured a revolver with the necessary ammiv&#xD;
titiod and various tools, adapted to digging in the ground.&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       219&#xD;
With the revolver in his pocket and the tools on his shoulders&#xD;
he managed to leave the house and reach the boat unseen. There&#xD;
he locked all the articles in a chest, whose cover, as we have seeki&#xD;
on another occasion, served as a seat and then with a lighter&#xD;
heart returned home to wait for the momentous hour.&#xD;
That night Charles did not sleeps'much. Slowly the hours or&#xD;
darkness passed away; and the morning hours in the office of the&#xD;
factory'not much faster. At last the whistle proclaimed the mid-&#xD;
dle of the day and Charles walked to the cottage so quickly that.&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs could hardly keep up with him.&#xD;
The young man was still afraid, that something would happen&#xD;
to spoil this double pleasure for him; and when at last dinner&#xD;
was over and Dolores with a becoming blush presented herself to&#xD;
him as ready for the excursion, he.hardly accepted it as a matter&#xD;
of fact, but rather as an illusion that would flow into shapeless&#xD;
mist on the first contact with reality. But when they left the&#xD;
cottage and walked towards the bay, her arm leaning.for support&#xD;
on his own as of old, he became tolerably well assured, that he&#xD;
was not dreaming and displayed a gay humor which was in keep-&#xD;
ing with the occasion and the day. The latter was a copy of the.&#xD;
one that had witnessed their first joint attempt upon the sea, shin-&#xD;
ing with all the brilliancy and radiance of a northern autumn day.&#xD;
Dolores could not help recalling the adventures of that eventful&#xD;
day. How things had changed since. . How some actors had left&#xD;
.the stage, to make room for others! How she herself had grown&#xD;
and changed ! Yet she was to embark in the very~boat that bore&#xD;
her then and the same nimble handsome youth, that led her steps&#xD;
two years ago, was at her side. But Henry? His absence caused&#xD;
her thoughts to turn upon him.&#xD;
"Where is Henry?" she asked her friend "did lie refuse to ac-&#xD;
company us? If I recollect right, I have seen neither him nor&#xD;
your uncle in the cottage at breakfast or dinner."&#xD;
Charles laughed:&#xD;
"They had no, time to waitfor breakfast this-morning" he&#xD;
said "so they took a bite and started off at a good speed."&#xD;
"But where did they go?"&#xD;
"To chase  wild oose and ride uncle's hobby."&#xD;
"You mean, they hunt the testament?"&#xD;

lawyer nearly seventy years of age, who has always had a great&#xD;
Ipractise and is more likely to know of any such instrument, in&#xD;
case it does exist-than any other man of his profession. To put&#xD;
uncle on the scent, was all that was required; he shot off like a&#xD;
well trained pointer and by this time undoubtedly is boring old&#xD;
Mr. Sharp to death with his questions."&#xD;
"But Charlie ,will our expedition be any less of a wild goose&#xD;
ch se, than theirs?"&#xD;
'Yes Dol considerably. We know at least the nest of the bird&#xD;
and if we fail to find any eggs there, we will at once be satisfied&#xD;
that there is no use, in hunting them at any .otherplace. But&#xD;
here is the boat Dol. Jump in while I erect the mast and loosen&#xD;
the chain."&#xD;
Soon the boat was in sailing trim and the paig started on it&#xD;
errand. This time the straight course to the rocky island was&#xD;
str  ck and that reached, the entrance to the wider channel was&#xD;
gained. Here the sail was taken down and the oar substituted&#xD;
an l assisted by his previous knowledge, Charles soon reached the&#xD;
last basin before the cave. On their way they had found the track&#xD;
clear; no sign of any vessel had shown itself and Charles was&#xD;
th refore reasonable certain that they would this time remain un-&#xD;
m1 lested by foreign intruders. Still lie thought best to prepare&#xD;
fo the worst;1 so, opening his chest, he armed himself with his&#xD;
re toluer placing it ready for immediate use and after that took&#xD;
out the tools. -'t&#xD;
oNow Dol, look out for your head" he said "we are going to&#xD;
rbss the Rubicon."&#xD;
t'he boat entered the fissure and half a minute afterwards they&#xD;
ce more swain on the basin within the cave. There waste&#xD;
sme old beautiful twilight, the somber shade, the trembling&#xD;
streaks of light on the walls, the looming vault, the deep mysteri-&#xD;
ous silence. The recollection of the first visit and the exciting&#xD;
:adventure rose so vividly within their minds; as to cast its shadow&#xD;
to the present hour. They could not help feeling a little nervous&#xD;
and Charles said:&#xD;
"Come, Dol, let us go to work. If we indulge too long in con-&#xD;
tempitation of the beauty of this place, we shall get so sentimentalee&#xD;
your hand now, to alight. What a beautiful sand this is."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        22L&#xD;
"Yes fit to grace the halls of any king of old. What do you&#xD;
mean to do now?"&#xD;
"I mean first to pay a visit to the rear cave. I put a dark lant«&#xD;
ern in my pocket, that will now do us good service."&#xD;
He set to work lighting the lantern and meanwhile Dolores&#xD;
asked him ihat he expected to find there.&#xD;
"I have reasons to believe, that the 'cave contains a cargo of&#xD;
steel. Wood left it there, to serve as a trap for Mr. Fox to fall&#xD;
into: instead of that it shall do us good service and partly indem-&#xD;
nify us for'the superintendent's rascalities. But we must not sell&#xD;
the bear's hide, before we catch the animal; so away with specu-&#xD;
lations. Come, Dol, reach me your hand and forward into the&#xD;
laws of H-ades!"&#xD;
He laughed but started a little, when his mirth awoke a loud&#xD;
echo in the cave, that filled it with its verberations.&#xD;
"Listen! the spirits of the cave are mocking you !"&#xD;
"Let them mock; if they only resign to us the treasures in their&#xD;
dare."&#xD;
"But people say, treasures are watched by evil malignant spirits&#xD;
it would hardly do to provoke their ire."&#xD;
"I do not fear them, as long as my good spirit is leading -m."&#xD;
"Why Charlie" Dolores answered with a laugh "if that come&#xD;
pliment refers to my humble person; you had better reverse yom&#xD;
figure of speech. If my senses do not deceive me I am a spirit&#xD;
led ,not leading."&#xD;
The young man had no time to answer to her raillery; for th&#xD;
had meanwhile traversed the p ssage and, now stood within t&#xD;
second cave. Charles opened 1 is lantern and when its light shot.&#xD;
through the specious vault a sl out of joy burst from his lips&#xD;
Piled up in formidable rows large numbers of the well-k1nown&#xD;
boxes displayed themselves to their view. Charles could hot in'a&#xD;
moment form an estimate of their value; but he knew that they&#xD;
were very valuable and that if he appropriated them for his em-&#xD;
Il)oyer, he would find nobody to dispute his claims. But the&#xD;
sword of Damocles was still hanging over their heads and an un-&#xD;
timely visit ion the pai:t of the revenue-officers was apt to spoil&#xD;
the game. Opposed as the young man was to smuggling&#xD;
claimed the right of Mr. Fox to appropriate this cargo  tee&#xD;
on account of the losses he had sustained by the sperintend&#xD;
&#xD;

cuts fraudulent transactions. He did not know the shipper and&#xD;
did not care to learn his name. If he was bold enough to come&#xD;
and advance his claims-then it would still, be time to consider&#xD;
the expediency of surrendering the goods, or pay for them.&#xD;
This reasoning might perhaps not have stood the test of logic;&#xD;
but it was natural under the circumstances and such as a fair-&#xD;
minded person would hardly have objected to.&#xD;
"I must engage a few trusty persons, to land this cargo," Char-&#xD;
lie remarked to his companion "it would be too dangerous to&#xD;
leave it here any length of time."&#xD;
"But does it belong to us, Charlie?"&#xD;
"I think it does. It has certainly been paid for by money out&#xD;
Mr. Fox' pocket. We cannot think of relinquishing it now."&#xD;
"Well you know best: what next do you intend to undertake?"&#xD;
"Oh yes ! I am glad you put me in mind of it. We must now&#xD;
search for uncle Eberhardt's last will and----maybe-treasures."&#xD;
"And you have really any hope of finding it?"&#xD;
"Why not, Dol? It was made-we know that from his own&#xD;
testimony. It was nlot recorded, or the books of some court or&#xD;
other would contain it: why then not think, that it may be hid-&#xD;
den in a place where the writer found a sudden death?"-&#xD;
S"And where do you think of searching first?"&#xD;
"There, where the skeleton is lying in the front cave."&#xD;
"Br! I shudder at the idea of disturbing the pirate's remains."&#xD;
"The thought is not pleasant; but it must be entertained and&#xD;
acted upon, if we want to make any discoveries. Just think of&#xD;
him returning from the cave. Hardly able to stand, he reaches&#xD;
the precints of fhe cave. He lands and sinks upon the ground;&#xD;
his'blood is oozing from his wounds in spite of all efforts to stop&#xD;
its flow. He grows weaker and with approaching death the burn- .&#xD;
ing passion of his restless ,heart flames once more up with its&#xD;
.     former brillancy. His thoughts turn to the love of his youth; the&#xD;
testament in which he gave his all unto her children becomes fore-&#xD;
most in his mind. . Reason is already waning and his instinct be-&#xD;
comes supreme. Like the faithful dog, intrusted with the keeping.&#xD;
of a treasure he gathers the last strength to make an effort of&#xD;
reaching the spot, where the will is buried. The task is painful&#xD;
in the extreme; but he bends an iron will to its achievement and&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLOREs.                       223&#xD;
he succeeds. He covers the ground where his secret dies with&#xD;
him and with a sigh of relief his soul parts from his body."&#xD;
"Ah! you paint lively, Charles" Dolores whispered with a shud-&#xD;
der having grasped her companion's arm more firmly as he pro-&#xD;
ceeded. Methinks I see him now. Say nothing 'ore about him&#xD;
please. I am not supertitious, you know, but I feel as if your&#xD;
eloquent description could conjure his spirit into life.''&#xD;
"Well you shall have your way, Dol. I do not wish to disturb&#xD;
his soul, unless it is like that of the Spanish licentiate which was&#xD;
buried on the wayside. You recollect the clever student, that&#xD;
lifted his saul in the shape of genuine coubloans. To such a re-&#xD;
surrection I should have no objections whatever. But reallywe&#xD;
chat as if it was our object, to talk us into courage. Come now;&#xD;
let us begin, or we shall not get through to-day."&#xD;
With these words he retraced his steps carrying the lantern in&#xD;
one hand and leading Dolores by the other. Having reache the&#xD;
front cave, he blew out the lantern, the sunlight creeping through&#xD;
the fissures of the racks illuminating it sufficiently for his pur-&#xD;
pose. Then taking a shovel he approached the spot where the&#xD;
decaying skeleton was lying. He felt an unpleasant sensation&#xD;
creeping over his body, when the tool touched the first bone;&#xD;
but nerving himself and laughing at his own folly, he went to&#xD;
work with a zest, that soon accomplished his purpose. When the&#xD;
place was cleared, the young man stopped and begging his com-&#xD;
panion to come up, laid the pick into her hand.&#xD;
"I don't want to be better than you in the way of superstition"&#xD;
he said gaily. Just drive in- the gick for a beginning: it will bring&#xD;
me good look."&#xD;
She complied with a light laugh and then returned the tool&#xD;
which he handled with a good will. But the ground was dry and&#xD;
loose and he soon found that the shovel would do the work alone.&#xD;
Throwing the sand to one side, he had penetrated to the depth of&#xD;
A. foot and a half; when the shovel struck on something solid.&#xD;
Dolores heard it and in her excitement could not prevent a light&#xD;
cry from escaping her lips. Charles did not cry, but he was&#xD;
hardly less affected and obliged to stop working for a moment.&#xD;
"There! see, what a fool I am" he said stretching his trembling&#xD;
hand towards Dolores "Simply, because my shovel strike as&#xD;

&#xD;
body, that may be nothing but a board or worthless box, I fall a&#xD;
prey to an excitement, of which I ought to be ashamed."&#xD;
"But, you surely struck upon a box, Charlie" she said eagerly.&#xD;
"Well supposing I did, child, where is the difference? We&#xD;
study the works of ancient and modern philosophers ; we can't&#xD;
upon the vanity of gold and yet when we cafch a mere glimgse of&#xD;
its lustre; we get into extasies and forget our lessons like the&#xD;
poodle does his tricks, when he sees a chance at mutton chops."&#xD;
"But why don't you proceed Charlie?"&#xD;
"Talking, Dol?"&#xD;
j'No digging, sir. You know very well what I meant."&#xD;
"I stop for twoi'easons, Dol. Firstly, I want to punish you&#xD;
and me for this want of equanimity and secondly I want to steady&#xD;
my nerves for further efforts. If I give way at the sound of an&#xD;
olcboard, where will I be when my eye lights' on treasures like&#xD;
Aladdin's?"&#xD;
"Charlie I never knew, what a great talker you could be."&#xD;
"That will do Dol. Say nothing more, for here it goes."&#xD;
Again the sand flew from the hole and a repeated striking on&#xD;
the substance underneath gave proof beyond a doubt, that it was&#xD;
a board in a horizontal position which impeded their progress.&#xD;
In her zeal to see, Dolores came nearer and nearer and both she&#xD;
acid Charles had by this time lost every recollection of the bones.&#xD;
They began to feel that sfrange mysterious influence, which magic&#xD;
gold exercises over the calmest of men. - Mind, they didn't know&#xD;
as yet, whether they would strike a golden vein or not-the mere&#xD;
prospect was sufficient, to make their eyes sparkle with Jeen sus-&#xD;
pense, their nostrils widen like the steed's that that scents the&#xD;
bloody battle. The bloodhound can not more eagerly pursue the&#xD;
track of the runaway, than man follows up the track of gold. Yes,&#xD;
gold is powerful on earth, more powerful, than we might wish for&#xD;
the sake of mankind; but no teaching of philosophy, nor preach-&#xD;
ing of the gospel will much affect the case. I am pretty sure,&#xD;
that if such a chance should present itself to me jnstnow, I should&#xD;
lay down my pen and stopping these reflections, grasp for the pre-&#xD;
cious metal as greedily as'most other persons.&#xD;
Charles pnd Dolores' were noble specimens of their kind and if&#xD;
the good, the virtuyus are thus affected by the thought of gold,&#xD;
what may we expect of the warshippers of sin and mammon? Is&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       22,&#xD;

iNo, wonder thso mar   crimes are committed in the diggings?&#xD;
N1o, we are to marvel that matters ar ntWose ha poled&#xD;
not ct t suh paces niater are not worse, that people do&#xD;
not act at such places, as if all the demons of hell were driving&#xD;
them to sin and death. That even the gold fields of Australia,&#xD;
California, and Nevada show instances, numerous instances of&#xD;
public and private virtue is apt, to impress us with a high opinion&#xD;
of man's spiritual condition.&#xD;
Now the sand is all removed and a board that has perhaps been&#xD;
abre tere for tho, tnany years, comes to light. But it isn't&#xD;
fo mere board, for tho' the edges lie free from the ground, the ef-&#xD;
fotto turn it up with the shovel, l .oesil&#xD;
Jt is a box, beyond all doubt, and in the excie&#xD;
covery Charles applies most chilish means to raise it from the&#xD;
ground. Kneeling dow-ni ensthrieetfrmthe&#xD;
gundi th  eia on  he1)11115 and tugsdand lifts and pushes,&#xD;
until the perspiration roll -fro  his forehead to the gronnd and a&#xD;

lrto his feet.  ot sticks in there as tight as if a dozen imps&#xD;
Wiesre i con it.!    mist enlarge the hole, and loosen the&#xD;
Tides, efroma t expect to lift it from the ground."&#xD;
To judge from the cover the 1ox seemed to e about two feet&#xD;
square, the third d pension as sticking in the ground, remaining&#xD;
largerenouh to wals therefore no small labor, to dig out a cavity,&#xD;
laged, eoe Colow room on all sides of the box and a full hour&#xD;
elapsed, before Charles accomplished the task. The box was&#xD;
bundrth  ottoe and lteo ie succeeded in getting his fingers&#xD;
under" the bottom  and lifted with all lte  n''  ,  his might, he did not sl&#xD;
ceed in raising it more than a line O htwo.&#xD;
This weight was a favorable indication.&#xD;
"Dol" Charles said seriously "that chest contains either lead or&#xD;

disapoint   to contain the former metal--could yon bear the&#xD;
"Yes Charlie I think I coult1-&#xD;
"Yes  harle I hinkI coltough I must confess, that it&#xD;

and then disappointed your expectation, unless I knew, that in&#xD;
such a case your peace of mind would suffer no lasting detriment."&#xD;
"Oh! Charlie, it is not as bad as that. Just work away, I think&#xD;
I can bear the consequences like a stoic, no matter how the thing&#xD;
may turn out."&#xD;
"Well then, here is the pick,-which will soon settle the question.&#xD;
A couple of blows well applied and the cover will spring: hold&#xD;
your breath Dol !"&#xD;
Down the pick went between the over and side board, but the&#xD;
box was stronger than Charles had fancied. Strong hinges held it&#xD;
on one side and a massive padlock on the other and in spite of&#xD;
lifting and tugging the first blow made little impression. The&#xD;
second one, dealt with even greater force somewhat widened the&#xD;
crack produced by its predecessor, but it wasn't until a full dozen&#xD;
had been spent upon the cover, that it finally yielded with a crash&#xD;
and in consequence of a jerk with the pickax flew back. Eagerly&#xD;
four eyes send their glances in the box, but another obstaele in&#xD;
shape of a piece of oilcloth impeded their view. This/ cover being&#xD;
also removed by the trembling hand of Charles some parchments&#xD;
made their appearance and between them and beside them round&#xD;
coins of large size and yellow color, on which the feeble light of&#xD;
the cave awoke a fait reflection.&#xD;
"The testament!"&#xD;
"The gold!"&#xD;
After this simultaneous cries deep silence. It was true, reality!&#xD;
Their boldest expectations had been realized, yes more than&#xD;
realized, for if that whole box was filled that way-their fancy&#xD;
was slow in furnishing figures large enough to meet the truth.&#xD;
There was gold in masses, in larger heaps, than these young peo-&#xD;
ple had ever seen or dreamt them. There was also the testament&#xD;
of the former owner, by virtue of which they, without doubt, were&#xD;
installed as proper heirs. Charles took it up as if in a dream and&#xD;
glancing over the contents, convinced himself of the correctness&#xD;
of his supposition.&#xD;
"Well, Dol, what now? he suddenly addressed the girl, turning&#xD;
abruptly to her., "Are you satisfied with my sagacity? Was I&#xD;
correct in my conjectures ?"&#xD;
"Yes Charlie, you were right; but don't speak to me just now!&#xD;

"Child what is the matter? you are drunk-!"&#xD;
"Yes Charlie I am' drunk, intoxicated with this sight But I&#xD;
am getting over it now and if you will bear with  f&#xD;
meant, ['11 be myself again. So, now my head feels clearer."&#xD;
It would be vain to try, to render the rambling conversation&#xD;
now ensuing. Little children could not have ben wildersafter&#xD;
school-hours, than our friends hovering over their discovered&#xD;
treasure. Now they laughed and the next momentthey sobered&#xD;
down to earnestness ven tinged with sadness; now they let the&#xD;
coins slip through their fingers, listening to the merry tinkle&#xD;
with which they struck against their comrades underneath; and&#xD;
anon they rose to their feet, stepping even back and looking at&#xD;
the treasure with a look of awe. But sitting or standing, laugh&#xD;
ing or chatting, they built all the while air castles of the most&#xD;
fantastic nature, and would no doubt have continued th sport&#xD;
if the deepening'shades of the cave had not at last reminded thet&#xD;
of the approach of night and the necessity of fixing  e&#xD;
"We must bury the gold again for the present," Charles pag-.&#xD;
gested, "and come for-it some other time."&#xD;
"But it may be found and stolen !"&#xD;
Care and trouble, the inseparate companions of gold had al&#xD;
ready made their appearance.&#xD;
"That is true!" Charles replied "but it can't be hel  W&#xD;
could take but little with us, and that little would be apt to be-&#xD;
tray us. But I shall take the will and place it in the safe of the&#xD;
office. There it will be secure,'you know, and we shall need it,&#xD;
to establish our claims to all this gold."&#xD;
"It will not all be ours, Charles. Part of it bel&#xD;
Jacob and part to father."&#xD;
"No'Dol, I hardly think, that the testament gives anyth&#xD;
siderable to Mr. Fox. I should not wonder, if it deprived him&#xD;
even of a large portion of the wealth he now enjoys.&#xD;

"Nor I either Dol. I could not think of such a course."&#xD;
"Are you in earnest Charlie?" she asked with brightening eyes.&#xD;
"In dead earnest child: how can you doubt my word?"&#xD;
"I do not doubt it; only the fear of danger to pa's prosperity&#xD;
confused my head. I thank you Charlie from the bottom of my&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
"There is no occasion for that Dolores. But to obtain our&#xD;
wishes, we must secrete the document for awhile. If it was put&#xD;
in court, I should be powerless to protect the interests of Mr.&#xD;
Fox; but by keeping it back and merely hinting atour discovery.&#xD;
we may obtain better terms from uncle Jacob." '&#xD;
"Manage it just as you think best ; only Mr. Fox must not suf-&#xD;
fer in consequence of any good luck of mine."&#xD;
"He shall not, Dol, if I can help it; but I may as well tell you,&#xD;
that Mr. Fox is at present in great pecuniary embarrassment. He&#xD;
may even become a bankrupt, if he does not soon succeed in rais-&#xD;
ing large sums of money."&#xD;
"Charlie, you alarm me."&#xD;
"Now, would you have ahy objection, if in case of necessity,&#xD;
I take a portion of this money, to set him right again?"&#xD;
"Not the least, Charlie: how can you ask. You know that I&#xD;
would gladly forfeit my whole share to assist him."&#xD;
"I thought so; but this is business and in business it is always&#xD;
best to have a clear understanding. But now I must set to work to&#xD;
bury the gold. It would not do, to leave any trace of my digging."&#xD;
After fastening the cover on the box, Charles threw the sand&#xD;
with the shovel back into the hole and this task being much eas-&#xD;
ier than the work of excavating, he finished it in less than half-&#xD;
-in-hour. Every trace of the operation was then carefully oblit-&#xD;
erated and the bones were replaced in their previous position. The&#xD;
sun had already sunk below the horizon when the pair finally&#xD;
stepped into the boat and shoving it through the entrance, steered&#xD;
throuagli the intricate passages of the channel. On reaching the&#xD;
open ea the mast was hoisted and a favorable breeze drove the&#xD;
loat rapidly through the waves towards the little harbor. Many&#xD;
glances he two cast back at the place, that had their precious se-&#xD;
cret, and even after reaching the land and walking towards the&#xD;
village, their eyes wandered in the direction of the cemetery, al-&#xD;
though the last vestige of it had long ago disappeared from sight-.&#xD;

S uggaer was over, when they reached the cottage, but Mrs.&#xD;
Fuchs had not forgotten them. Placing tlhe reserved food upon&#xD;
the table and pouring out a cup of freshly prepared tea, she sum-&#xD;
moned the two, to sit down and make up for lost time.&#xD;
Neither Charles nor Dolores were in the least hungry; but they&#xD;
had to force themselves, to take a few bites, in order to avoid&#xD;
questions, which they could not have answered without consider-&#xD;
able embarrassment. They had resolved to keep their discovery&#xD;
secret, until they were capable of calm reflection, and Dolores&#xD;
had left it to Charlie'sjudgment, to decide when this period should&#xD;
arrive. Mrs. Fuchs kept them company but while their lips were&#xD;
talking one thing, their thoughts wandered off to another.&#xD;
The hostess noticed it; she told them, that they were rather&#xD;
stupid, but being kind enough, to attribute their absence of mind&#xD;
to the fatigue of their excursion, she advised both the young peo-&#xD;
ple to retire to bed at an early hour.&#xD;
"I have arranged with Lucy, to relieve -you altogether for the&#xD;
coming night, Del" she said. After this trip you will enjoy a&#xD;
good sleep and you shall have it. Don't contradict me! It is all&#xD;
cut and dry and no use to try a change."&#xD;
"But Mrs. Fox...."&#xD;
"Is so well this evening, that she expects to sleep the whole&#xD;
night. You may see her for a minute; but after that-to bed&#xD;
Miss Dolores and that without delay too."&#xD;
Dolores was only too well inclined to accept Mrs. Fuchs'. kind-&#xD;
ness. Her late discovery had in a measure disqualified her for a&#xD;
nurse and she greatly delighted at the thought, of lying on her&#xD;
bed and being at liberty to let her thought wander over the adven-&#xD;
tures of the afternoon. Yet she did not enjoy that pleasure very&#xD;
long; for she had hardly stretched her weary limbs on her mat-&#xD;
tress, when the fatigue of the body overcame the excitement of&#xD;
the soul and soon sunk her into a deep slumber, during which her&#xD;
fancies assumed the garb of dreams, treating the same stuff, but&#xD;
exaggerating a thousand times the circumstances of reality.&#xD;

his head ached; but in spite of his musings he saw no way of&#xD;
securing the treasure, without the assistance of some confidental&#xD;
friend. Henry would not answer; much less uncle Jacob with&#xD;
his greedy avarice. His father was too timid and indecisive in&#xD;
his measures, but still he was the only one, that could be thought&#xD;
of. So next morning, when they had reached the factory, Charles&#xD;
requested a private interview with his father at the office and gave&#xD;
him as short and clear an account as possible. Mr. Fuchs list-&#xD;
ened with every sign of astonishment and after Charles had ended,.&#xD;
replied:&#xD;
"My son, if I did not know that you are a sober steady lad and&#xD;
would not entertain the thought of. making fun of your father, I&#xD;
should not credit the story. And you knew the secret of the-&#xD;
cave for two years?"&#xD;
"Yes, father and that was the reason of my silence in regard to&#xD;
Mr. Wood's transactions. I burned to speak, as you may well&#xD;
imagine; but I could not think of violating my oath."&#xD;
"Of course not Charlie, of course not. I approvd of your con.&#xD;
duct; yes I admire it, and that of little Dol even more' pet. Who.&#xD;
would have thought of giving her credit for so much character?"&#xD;
I father; indeed I would have trusted her in far greater temp-&#xD;
tations. But you forget the gold."&#xD;
"Ah yes; I can as yet not force myself to look upon your story&#xD;
as reality. You have the testament in your possession, you say?"&#xD;
"Yes father" he replied, untying a portfolio, which he had taken&#xD;
from the house and never for a moment released from his grasp..&#xD;
The parchnent he drew out, had grown yellow with time; but the&#xD;
sand in which it had been buried, was so dry and the oilcloth-&#xD;
cover had so effectually kept out all destructive influences that,&#xD;
not a letter of the document had become illegible.. Unfolding it&#xD;
he asked his father:&#xD;
"Shall I read it?"&#xD;
"If you please.&#xD;
On Board the Rover.&#xD;
Septbr, 20. 1760.&#xD;
Be it known to all concerned, that I have this day drawn up my&#xD;
last will and testament and intend to leave my property as follows:&#xD;
1st. The box in the cave of the cemetery. on the coast of&#xD;
Maine, containing in doubloons and diamonds the sum of $250,.&#xD;

-'It is possible !" Mr. Fuchs could not abstain from interrupting.&#xD;
....I leave to the children of my sister-in-law Caroline Fuchs&#xD;
residing at B. in the Palatinate on the Rhine in equal portions.&#xD;
2. My estate at Foxville in the Colony of Maine, I also leave&#xD;
to the children of said Caroline, and the heir or heirs of my&#xD;
brother Walter, who now resides thereon, taking charge of th&#xD;
same for me; the land to be equally divided amongst all the part-&#xD;
ies above named.&#xD;
"Poor Mr. Fox" Charles interrupted himself.&#xD;
"That would deprive him of a portion of his property."&#xD;
"The great portion father; /,but Dol and I have made up our&#xD;
mind, that he shall suffer no detriment whatever-were we right&#xD;
father?"&#xD;
"Of course m3 boy; but I fear, uncle Jacob would think differ-&#xD;
ently."&#xD;
"So do I. For that reason we must keep quiet about the will&#xD;
unless we can induce him to sign a written agreement, that suits&#xD;
our purpose."&#xD;
"But will he do that?"&#xD;
"I think he will; leave that to me, father, I know how to&#xD;
manage him.&#xD;
"Very well, Charlie: but go on with the will."&#xD;
"Well, that is nearly all. The signature is testified to by two&#xD;
witnesses, both of whom seem to have been officers of the Rover.&#xD;
The paper is evidently unfinished or at least the formality of&#xD;
recording is lacking. We know from Eberhardt's letter, that it&#xD;
was his intention to have it recorded; but a rapid death seems to&#xD;
have prevented the execution of the purpose."&#xD;
"You may be right Charlie; but what do you propose doing&#xD;
with the money ?"&#xD;
"That is the difficulty. By means of levers we two might suc-&#xD;
ceed in shipping the box and conveying it safely to the cottage&#xD;
or better to the large safe here in the office; but how shall we&#xD;
both get off at the same time, without creating suspicion?"&#xD;
"We might start before daybreak and that way manage to get&#xD;
aback at an early h our."&#xD;
'*But not in time to start the factory here."&#xD;
"That would be hardly necessary, I might instruct the foreman&#xD;
the night before and he could get along well enough for a couple&#xD;
of hours."&#xD;

"But the horse and wagon father ?"&#xD;
"On returning to the bay, I could stay in the boat and you go&#xD;
for the wagon."                                  . ,,,&#xD;
"But if Henry or uncle Jacob should ask an explanation?"&#xD;
"We must send them off on some errand or other."&#xD;
"They will hardly go. I took that liberty with uncle yester-&#xD;
day, sending him to lawyer Sharp at Hilltown. He is not in the&#xD;
brightest humor this morning in consequence of the useless walk."&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs laughed.&#xD;
"I do not wonder : it is no fmi to run ten miles and back for&#xD;
nothing. We must hit upon another expedient then. How would&#xD;
it do, to give him plenty of Deidesheimer Traminer this evening?"&#xD;
"That would indeed chain him to his bed till a late hour; but&#xD;
what of Henry ?"&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs sighed.&#xD;
"Alas! Charlie, your brother will not neglect a chance of im-&#xD;
bibing freely. If I don't check his drinking, he will be even less&#xD;
dangerous to-morrow mornimg than my brother."&#xD;
Charles shook his head.&#xD;
"I hate to base my calculations on my brother's degradation.&#xD;
Goodness knows, he is low enough without it. However we must&#xD;
secure the box to-morrow and one drunken spell more or less will&#xD;
eventually matter little. So the plan is fixed, thanks to your&#xD;
sagacity, father. It seems to me, as if we had changed roles for&#xD;
once. Generally you counsel caution and have to check my ardor&#xD;
this time the case lies just reversed. Can you account for that&#xD;
phenomenon?"&#xD;
"No Charlie, unless it is, that I am getting restless and inpat-&#xD;
ient, to see so big'a pile of gold."&#xD;
"May be that is the cause; but I know this, that if you had&#xD;
once seen the gold like me, you would be shy and timid also. I&#xD;
cannot rid myself of the thought, that by some chance intruder&#xD;
the secret may leak out."&#xD;
"Well, that risk is as great one day as another or rather every&#xD;
day increases it. The sooner we remove the gold, the better."&#xD;
"You are right again father, so have your way about it. You&#xD;
had better make the necessary arrangement all at once. Invent&#xD;
any story'for the foreman, that seems credible."&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs was on the point of leaving the office, when suddenly&#xD;
he returned, saying:&#xD;
"Charlie, you spoke of a cargo of steel in the cave: we have not&#xD;
fixed on any course regarding that."&#xD;
"You are right" Charles lively responded; ,that too requires&#xD;
immediate attention."&#xD;
"And what would you propose?"&#xD;
"Oh! that is easily managed. Wood in his contraband trade&#xD;
must have had accomplices to fetch the steel. Has any one be&#xD;
sides George lately left the factory?"&#xD;
"Not to my knowledge, Charlie."&#xD;
"Then we have our men. .1 know John the driver is one of&#xD;
them and if we attack him on a sudden and threaten with dire&#xD;
punishment, he will not only betray the other part ies, but vol-&#xD;
unteer to haul the cargo as an offset for his offense."&#xD;
"So you. will shift the matter entirely off your hands? The&#xD;
plan is excellent. When do you mean to start them?"&#xD;
"This evening if possible. The revenue officers might spoil the&#xD;
job for us."&#xD;
"But can they remove the boxes in one night? You know, to-&#xD;
morrow they would be in our way."&#xD;
"I hope they can, and--if not. they may divide the job into&#xD;
two night's labor."&#xD;
"Exactly. You seem to have regained your nerve Charlie.&#xD;
Shall I send you the driver while I inform the foreman?"&#xD;
L you please Sir."&#xD;
A few minutes afterwards John the drivernade his appear-&#xD;

"Sit down, John" Charles addressed him. "I wanted to sek&#xD;
a word or two to you. You know the superintendent has cut sticks&#xD;
and left us in a pretty fix?"&#xD;
The driver started.&#xD;
"Well yes, I know, Charlie ; but then, you' 'know-I don't see&#xD;
exactly--."I dont see, what I have to do with that."&#xD;
"Oh! I thought, you might give us some information, John.&#xD;
You know you were always on very good terms with Mr. Wood."&#xD;

By this time Charles was sure of the man's oomplicity. So&#xD;
changing his easy mode off speaking into a rapid energetic one,&#xD;
he said suddenly:&#xD;
"But I know: Wood used to smuggle steel from 'the cemetery&#xD;
and you assisted him."&#xD;
A flash from the blue sky could not have struck the driver&#xD;
more unexpectedly and forcibly, than this sudden declaration. He&#xD;
stared at Charles with eyes and mouth open, the helpless victim&#xD;
of unbounded consternation. At last he made an effort to collect&#xD;
himself, but before he had uttered a single word, Charles contin-&#xD;
uied:                                       wvahito&#xD;
"I have witnesses for what I say. I need but give a hit to&#xD;
the revenue officers and you will be delivered to the severity of&#xD;
the law. Moreover your situation is in jeopardy: one word from&#xD;
my lips and you leave this factory an unemployed man-..&#xD;
Longer John could not constrain himself. Springing to his&#xD;
feet and lifting his hands in an imploring manner, he cried:&#xD;
"Ahi Charlie,good Mr. Charlie, don't ruin a poor fellow, that&#xD;
merely did, what he was bid to do. It went against my grit to&#xD;
assist in cheating Mr. Fox-but what could I do? In these hard&#xD;
times a poor fellow is glad to earn an honest penny outside of his&#xD;
work. Please Sir, don't ruin me; I'll do anything in the world&#xD;
for you, only don't, don't inform on me."&#xD;
Charles looked at him with a steady eye. At length when he&#xD;
thought the fellow's fear had been wrought to a high enough&#xD;
pitch, he broke his silence, saying:&#xD;
"Very well John! You are a married man and I pity your wife&#xD;
and children. I shall keep silent on one condition."&#xD;
"What is it, Charlie, what is it ?" John inquired eagerly  "I'll&#xD;
do anything in my power to make amends."&#xD;
"There is a cargo of steel in the cave at present," Charles re-&#xD;
sumed.&#xD;
"Indeed is there? I didn't know it."&#xD;
"It is paid for with Mr. Fox' money and he cannot afford to&#xD;
lose it. He despises the nefarious practice of smuggling, but as&#xD;
Wood has smuggled this cargo so far, he cannot now inform the&#xD;
revenue officers without losing both his money and the goods. Do&#xD;
you understand me?"&#xD;
"Exactly, Sir, exactly."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
"well then, I'll pardon your assistance at&#xD;
you can manage to haul the cargo from the cave to the factr&#xD;

"Is it a large cargo ?"&#xD;
"Tolerably large."&#xD;
"And two nights would be too late for you?"&#xD;
"I should prefer to have the job done all at oce. To show&#xD;
you, that I mean well; if the boxes are in our yard, tos-mrow&#xD;
morning at 4 o'clock, I shall not only say aod word ourrow&#xD;

John's countenance brightened. Making  f      p&#xD;
Charles and extending his hand to him, ie said:&#xD;
"Charlie, I am your man. The deuce shall take me if you ain't&#xD;

About 9 o'clock a wagon with one horse drove up to the offic&#xD;
door. There were two men in it using a ro  upstro  b  asfce&#xD;

spiration from his brow. So far, so good. , We have reason to&#xD;
be satisfied with our success. Did you notice the boxes with steel&#xD;
in the shed?"&#xD;
"I did my son; but then we were sure to find them here, for&#xD;
you recollect, the cave was empty."&#xD;
"To be sure; but still it gratifies me considerably, to know&#xD;
them safe. We may now at our leisure transfer the contents of&#xD;
the chest to the large safe. This here would not hold half of&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"You promised John and his men a hundred dollars."&#xD;
"Exactly; but it would not do, to give him the money before&#xD;
the other hands. After we are through here, you.may please give&#xD;
him a hint to call on me after working hours."&#xD;
"I will Charlie ; but here is the hatchet. and a chisel,.to open&#xD;
the box."&#xD;
"Just one minute more father! Let Ime lower the curtain, to&#xD;
keep inquisitive eyes from prying into affairs, that do not concern&#xD;
them."&#xD;
The box was then opened and Mr. Fuchs, who now saw its con-&#xD;
tents for the first time, experienced nearly the same sensations of&#xD;
awe and pleasure, which his son had felt two days ago. Age is&#xD;
said to make us wiser and cooler; but few men get wise and cool&#xD;
enough, to free themselves from the charm of gold.&#xD;
The two had no time to count the money; but they had on the&#xD;
night before procured a dozen small but strong bags from Mrs.&#xD;
Fuchs and now put the coins into them for better handling. At&#xD;
the bottom of the chest they found a little box of rosewood,&#xD;
with steel corners and beautiful inlaid work of gold and enamel.&#xD;
It had a lock and a key sticking in it. On turning the key and&#xD;
lifting the cover, that worked on hinges, they had a sight, truly&#xD;
grand and startling. Large quantities of precious stones filled&#xD;
the box to the rim, some eut and reflecting the light a hundred&#xD;
fold, others, with rough covers, such as they are found in the&#xD;
mines of Brazil and India.&#xD;
"These are diamonds" Charles cried in excited but yet sub-&#xD;
dued tones. "No wonder the testament speaks of $250,000.00&#xD;
These stones alone, must be worth that sum in the hands of any&#xD;
man, who understands to sell them to advantage."&#xD;
"You may be right, for all I know; I have but little knowledg&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
of such matters. So here is the last bag; jut '&#xD;
 the safe."                                   put that in&#xD;
"No, stop a moment father. I want to count off twenty-five&#xD;
thousand Dollars to meet Mr. Fox' outstanding debt y&#xD;
"What? you would pay them of this money?"&#xD;
"Yes father. Dolores has given her consent, I hope that you&#xD;
have no objections?"&#xD;
"No my boy, not the least. Only be careful '&#xD;
This money belongs by right to the descendents of  olir achs,&#xD;
but the courts might raise trouble in the matter and...c"&#xD;
"I think it will be best, not to trouble the courts at all. If&#xD;
can get the heirs to make an amiable settlement t    e&#xD;
no outside person need know anything about this  attemev&#xD;
"But Charlie, there is danger in that. It is hardly possible to&#xD;
keep such things secret and if they do leak out yous subject your-&#xD;
self to bad repute and, may be, persecutions by the law."&#xD;
"Well let us leave that to more mature reflections, Now I want&#xD;
to count this money."&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs yielded the -point, as he was wont to do and the sum&#xD;
of twenty-five thousand Dollors was counted and hid aside.&#xD;
The rest of the day was passed in the common routine ofebusi-&#xD;

the office, Charles handed him the stipulated rewad g old.in&#xD;

They overlooked the virtues of their people and rewarded their&#xD;
iniquity. Thus they gained the approval of the wicked, the hat-&#xD;

At the cottage he found smiling faces, excepting uncle Jacob's&#xD;
and Henry's, that were shadow's. Uncle Jacob was out of humor,&#xD;
because so far he had made no headway at all in the great enter-&#xD;
prise of his life. Charles confidental communication regarding&#xD;
the whereabouts of the testament cheered him for a while; for&#xD;
having failed to receive any satisfactory detail from his nephew&#xD;
he began to suspect that the young man had merely talked at&#xD;
random with no other objeet in view, than that of securing his&#xD;
uncle's secrecy concerning Mrs. Fox' nightly adventure. He felt&#xD;
so vexed at this thought, that he would at once have broken his&#xD;
pledge, if the young man's impressive warning hadnot'stood vi-&#xD;
vidly before his mind and suggested the propriety of not risking&#xD;
his enmity. Besides, the knowledge of the real facts of the case&#xD;
might become too valuable, to merely throw away. If the testa-&#xD;
ment could not be found, uncle Jacob might after a while succeed&#xD;
in getting Mr. Fox to cash that knowledge to the amount of a&#xD;
few thousands and with that money he might return to Germany,&#xD;
for, rich or poor, he would never think of sending the remainder&#xD;
of his life in so disagreeable a country as these United States had&#xD;
proven themselves thus far to be.&#xD;
Uncle Jacob's thoughts were running in that strain, when&#xD;
Charles entered the parlor. Jacob was alone and Charles resolved:&#xD;
to benefit by the opportunity to push his plans. He had hardly&#xD;
seen, much less spoken to his uncle since that worthy's expedi&#xD;
tion into the country, and now the young man approached him&#xD;
in a pleasant manner, which was captivating to his uncle in pro-&#xD;
portion to its rareness.&#xD;
"Well, uncle, how do you do this evening? I havn't had time&#xD;
to speak to you, this day or two. You must excuse me on ac-&#xD;
count of the urgent duties, that now devolve upon me."&#xD;
Certainly Charlie, certainly my boy. I know you must have&#xD;
a hard time of it now."&#xD;
"Rather hard, uncle."&#xD;
"When do you expect Mr. Fox back?"&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       239&#xD;
"That's hard to tell, uncle. Mr. Fox is trying to raise money&#xD;
and that is a hard operation now-a-days."&#xD;
"Very true that Charlie, very true. I am a living example of&#xD;
that truth. I have been trying to raise money these twenty years&#xD;
and have not succeeded over well."&#xD;
"Better luck for the future then, uncle. You remember the&#xD;
testament."                                            1&#xD;
"Curse the testament" Jacob said with a sudd           -&#xD;
passion. But he checked himself saying:&#xD;
"Charles you held out some hope to me the other day: tell me&#xD;
the truth now, my boy: you merely wanted to lead your uncle&#xD;
somewhat by the nose, didn't you ?"&#xD;
Why uncle, what do you think? How would I dare to sho-&#xD;
disrespect to my father's brother?"&#xD;
"Thank you, Charlie, thank you very much. But to return to&#xD;
the subject: there was some foundations for the hints youdr&#xD;
ped ?"or-&#xD;
"Of course, uncle, or I shouldn't have dropped them. I repeat,&#xD;
that I have a pretty clear idea, where the testament emape&#xD;
found."m                                               be&#xD;
Charles smiled at the thought of uncle Jacob's total ignorance&#xD;
of the fact, how near his statement came to truth.&#xD;
"You have? have you my lad? Now come don't p      bl'&#xD;
man's buff with your old uncle, but speak out plainly that af&#xD;
low can understand you."&#xD;
These words were uttered with a kind of confidential security,&#xD;
the speaker moving up to Charles and laying his had p ersuas-&#xD;
sively upon the other's knee. Charles laughed.&#xD;
"You are trying to catch me with soft sodder uncle Jacob" he&#xD;
said "just as mother does the flies with honey. But I aint so&#xD;
easily caught as that my dear Sir. Do you think I  ant  o&#xD;

"Well shave away Charlie : how much hair must I sacrifice?&#xD;
Will a thousand dollars do?"&#xD;
"Ah you are generous uncle. I see you have a due appreciation&#xD;
of my secret; but I prefer to state the matter differently. First&#xD;
and foremost will you have the kindness to state in how many,&#xD;
shares the inheritance ought to be divided, according to your&#xD;
opinion ?"&#xD;
"In two Charlie, of course in two, one share falling to your,&#xD;
father, the other half to me."&#xD;
"And Dolores, uncle? It seems you leave her entirely in the&#xD;
cold."&#xD;
"Dolores? Ah yes I recollect now, she is the represetative of&#xD;
the Italian branch. -It is hard io think, that a little girl should&#xD;
come in for such a pile of money. ..."&#xD;
"Pile of money?" Charles interrupted him "hold on, uncle, your&#xD;
fancy is running off with you. Who spoke about a pile . of&#xD;
money?"&#xD;
"Didn't you speak of one Charlie? I thought you did.'At any&#xD;
rate there ought to be one. But what was I saying Charlie?&#xD;
You interrupted me."&#xD;
"Youtspoke of Dolores uncle."&#xD;
"Exactly, Charlie. I was going to say that if the thing could&#xD;
not be well avoided a few thousand dollars might be sacrificed,&#xD;
to satisfy the girl."&#xD;
"You are very liberal, uncle, that is a tact" Charles replied&#xD;
somewhat vexed by the manifestation of such sordid greediness,&#xD;
"the matter might be looked at from a very different point' of&#xD;
view. Dolores, one might say-represents the one branch ; you&#xD;
and father the other; consequently she is entitled to one half of&#xD;
the inheritance."&#xD;
This was too much for uncle Jacob. Jumping up with every&#xD;
sign of consternation in his face, he said:&#xD;
"Charlie ! lad! you must be mad, to entertain such thoughts!&#xD;
I tell you it would be downright wicked, to let so much money&#xD;
go out of the family."&#xD;
There! so much money again. I told you not to be too hasty,&#xD;
sir. If you entertain such miserly principles, I have nothing&#xD;
more to say."&#xD;
After these words Charles pretended to be desirious of ending-&#xD;

he had gone too far, eagerly pressed him bac  hisa ha&#xD;
"Dont go, Charlie" he cried "dont ou gs c          as&#xD;

a third, but an entire haZf--just think ofit e  a entitled to&#xD;
half! It is preposterous to-entertain the idea."&#xD;
Ah! you are coming round, I see. A third that sounds more&#xD;
reasonable."&#xD;
"So you give up the notion of the half?" Jacob cried "I th&#xD;
you would, for the position was untenable. Yes we'l ought&#xD;

The young man had to bite his lips, to keep from br 't&#xD;
a laugh. lie thought, he never saw the smile of the wolf in&#xD;
sheep's clothing more strikingly illustrated. Bnt to laugh  m -&#xD;
spoil the game; so he remained serious and said:-&#xD;
''Well, have it your own way. Let us assume that&#xD;

"What ? take? for my share?"&#xD;
Jacob was somewhat bewildered in consequence of th&#xD;

idea was enough, to make him tremble."etmere.&#xD;
"I want to know, how much you would take for your third? Is&#xD;
that not plain enough uncle?"&#xD;
"Yes, I understand you n1ow, Charlie. How mu&#xD;

"Coppers?"&#xD;
"Dollas of course" Jacob replied with a mien of injured d&#xD;
"One hundred thousand dollars? Charles said breakini&#xD;

he succeeded. Charles knew his man. He had much knowledge&#xD;
of men for one so young; he would have made a great statesman,.&#xD;
may be, if his cradle had stood in the hall of some great noble&#xD;
house. As it was, he merely had the chance of making his uncle&#xD;
keep step to his pipe; but he made the best of it.&#xD;
"Well Charlie, being your father's brother, I hope yqu didn't&#xD;
mean to apply that word to me. The sum can hardly be consid-&#xD;
ered high, when you take into account the property of Mr. Fox,&#xD;
which also belongs to Eberhardt's bequests."&#xD;
"I wouldn't be too sure about that, uncle. Mr Fox has been&#xD;
n possession so long, that you would find it exceedingly difficult&#xD;
to unhorse him. Moreover I'shall tell you in confidence,-mind&#xD;
uncle Jacob in confidence--that Mr. Fox is on the point of be-&#xD;
coming a bankrupt."&#xD;
Jacob started up.&#xD;
"You don't say so ? a bankrupt with that factory and fine man-&#xD;
sion and park?"&#xD;
"Yes, Sir, with all that and in spite of it; Mr. Fox is embar-&#xD;
rassed. But you mustn't speak of it, uncle."&#xD;
"Honor bright.!" Jacob cried pompously. "But that alters the&#xD;
case. I suppose I have to come down a button-hole or two."&#xD;
"I suppose so too, uncle."&#xD;
"What do you think of-of-no indeed!, I wont ask a sum at&#xD;
all. You better make me an offer now; yes make me an hand-&#xD;
some offer. I know you wouldn't skin your poor uncle too badly."&#xD;
"I told you, I would merely shave you: What do you think of&#xD;
twenty thousand?"&#xD;
"Now Charlie, come, you cannot be in earnest: twenty thousand!&#xD;
bah!"&#xD;
"Well call it thirty thousand, uncle."&#xD;
"Thirty thousand !". Jacob exclaimed, while his eyes began to&#xD;
sparkle at the readiness with, which his nephew flung away ten&#xD;
thousand Dollars. "Charlie my good boy, add another ten and&#xD;
Iam your man."&#xD;
Charles hesitated a moment, then he said:&#xD;
"I shall do even better uncle and pay you fifty thousand dollars&#xD;
=  for your share, but on one condition."&#xD;
"Name it Charlie, name it my boy."&#xD;
"After having given me a written renunciation, which is to be&#xD;
&#xD;
certified before witnesses, you depart at once for Germany, never&#xD;
to return."&#xD;
"But the money, Sir, the money?"&#xD;
'Will be handed you in drafts on a Frankfort house"&#xD;
Now uncle Jacob's selfcontrol was at an end. Jumping up and&#xD;
embracing his nephew, who suffered the caress with a bad enough&#xD;
grace, he cried:&#xD;
"Nothing else, Charlie? nothing else? With all my heart will&#xD;
I go and never           secofoudeWUialmyhrtwl&#xD;

"I'll give you the money to-morrov and you may start the daf&#xD;
after."&#xD;
"Just as yon please, my darling, just as you please."&#xD;
"Well, come to my room uncle. I shall draw upthe Papers ilT&#xD;
at once"&#xD;
"But you will not cheat me, Charlie will you?"&#xD;
The brow of the young man darkened:&#xD;
"I pardon your suspicion on account of your excitement If&#xD;
you think you cannot trust me, let us drop the matter altogether."&#xD;
"No! Charlie, no! my dear lad. You must not mind my&#xD;
tongue, because it makes me say things against my own will. I'll&#xD;
g w    you.&#xD;
In his room the young man drew up a paper in which J&#xD;
Fuchs pledged himself, to renounce all claims of a certain inherit..&#xD;
dance coming from his ancestor Eberhardt Fuchs in consideration&#xD;
of the payment of $50,000.00 in cash.                  o&#xD;
"Is that correct uncle?"&#xD;
"Exactly."&#xD;
"Now sign and then let us go to a couple of'ighois to  -&#xD;

"I do Charlie, give me the pen. So."&#xD;
He signed and then said:&#xD;
"Nowlet us go, Charlie."&#xD;

enough to certify the signature. When their nam  re wit&#xD;

"N o bep mum, uncle" Charles cautioned his companion.&#xD;
"Go to bed, and to-morrow morning you shall have your draft.",&#xD;
"I will Charlie, only I feel awfully dry: don't you think, we had&#xD;
better go into the cellar and seal our treaty with a bottle?"&#xD;
"I don't care uncle," Charles replied, fearing to contradict him&#xD;
in a point, where he kuew him to be stubborn. "I have no objec-&#xD;
tion to take a glass with you."&#xD;
So they went into the cellar and after a moderate libE tion&#xD;
Charles saw his uucle'into his room. There he waited until Jacob&#xD;
was in bed and then he went away to imitate his example.&#xD;
The next day was pay-day. When Charles reached the office,&#xD;
the men to whom he had made the confidential communication a&#xD;
few days ago, entered the room. They announced themselves as&#xD;
delegates from all the workmen in the factory and then stated,&#xD;
that they had been authorized to inform the new superintendent&#xD;
that they would all be willing to wait a month or even two months'&#xD;
for the money if necessary.&#xD;
"I thank you in Mr. Fox' name," Charles replied to them "I&#xD;
thank you most sincerely and I am sure Mr. Fox will be much&#xD;
pleased on his return, to learn your handsome conduct. However&#xD;
it gives me much pleasure, to announce to you, that your sacrifice&#xD;
has become unnecessary. We have managed to raise sufficient&#xD;
funds, to pay you all and if you will call at this office after twelve&#xD;
we shall be prepared to satisfy you. We intend to give you this&#xD;
afternoon as a holiday."&#xD;
"But, Mr. Charlie," said the speaker "if it should in the least&#xD;
embarrass Mr. Fox...."&#xD;
"It will not Sir, not in the least. We are fully prepared to set-&#xD;
tle all our debts with you and that without any trouble at all."_&#xD;
The men left. They didn't seem to like the turn of affairs; they&#xD;
seemed to be sorry, that they had been deprived of the chance, of&#xD;
rendering Mr. Fox a service.&#xD;
In the afternoon the hands were all paid off and the works were&#xD;
stopped for the balance of the day. While this transaction was&#xD;
still going on, uncle Jacob showed his face in the office. Charles&#xD;
beckoned himto his side.&#xD;
"You see, I am busy now, uncle" he whispered in his ear. "We&#xD;
shall have to postpone our settlement until to-morrow. In the&#xD;
meantime you get your things ready for leaving and say good bye&#xD;
&#xD;
to the women. They needn't know the reason of your going,nor&#xD;
your riches either. Do you hear uncle."&#xD;
"Yes Charlie, but the money. ea  .&#xD;
"Will be yoursto-morrow. I shall accompany you to Boston.&#xD;
I have business there and shall buy foreign bills of exchange for&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"You would trouble yourself that much for your uncle; Charlie,&#xD;
would you?"&#xD;
"I1t is no trouble, for I hav  o&#xD;
"s no to   f   have to go at anyerate. But now please&#xD;
excuse me. You see these people are all waiting and I must&#xD;

Uncle Jacob left Adgon1 o&#xD;

by the announcement of his resolution. Henry was even nore&#xD;
surprised than they and with his wonderment there was mixed a&#xD;
considerable amount of anger. nehad  really trusted to his&#xD;

but loquacious as uncle Jacob naturally was, the great sum of&#xD;
]Honey at stake induced him, to keep his peace.&#xD;
Charles.in the meantime continued his labors at the office, his&#xD;
father and the foreman assisting him. The people had formerly&#xD;
always received their wages in banknoteshe i e ad joymerd&#xD;

their money in gold coins of full weight. On the banknotes they-&#xD;

value to almost every one of them. Fortunately he was able to&#xD;
show them the column of doubloons in the "banknote detector;&#xD;
Other-wise he might not have been able, to induce them to receive&#xD;
the -money in spite of its being gold. Suspicion or rather dis-&#xD;
trust is one of the distinct traits of American character and one&#xD;
that is hardly commendable or creditable. While a due amount&#xD;
of caution may be regarded as a virtue,- undue suspicion is an ob-&#xD;
jectionable weakness. When, a man is over-cautious, it is but na-&#xD;
tural to presume, that he is guarding against measures which he&#xD;
Would not hesitate toemploy in his transactions with others.&#xD;
The foreman shared the common wonderment at these old&#xD;
coins.&#xD;
"Them doubloons is rather a curiosity" he said. "Where did&#xD;
you succeed in getting so large a pile of them ?"&#xD;
"They must have been hoarded away by the former superin-&#xD;
tendent in some old box or other," Charles answered evasively'&#xD;
pretending to be too busy, to give more detailed explanations.&#xD;
"I was s fool for paying the hands in these coins" he said to&#xD;
his father, when they finally were alone.&#xD;
"I warned you before-hand Charlie didn't I."&#xD;
"You warned me against touching the money at all, and not be-&#xD;
cause it consisted in Spanish doubloons. At least I didn't un-&#xD;
derstand it that way."&#xD;
"I may not have mentioned it ; but I surely had my misgiv-&#xD;
ings."  ams&#xD;
"I am almost sure, father, you didn't raise that objection. At&#xD;
any rate; it is too late to mend the matter now. The only thing&#xD;
we can do, is to guard against spending any more of that money&#xD;
in this neighborhood. I thought of laying .a check at our bank&#xD;
for the balance of the $25,000.00; but I am afraid to risk it. No&#xD;

"You do not think of going there, Charlie?"&#xD;
"With your permission, I do. You can manage the factory&#xD;

it, the more I am convinced that we ought not to take this mat-&#xD;
ter before the courts. I sounded uncle Jacob yesterday: if the&#xD;
will is taken into court for adjustment, Mr. Fox will be reduced&#xD;
to beggary. Your brother has no more scruples to sacrifice him&#xD;
than our cat."&#xD;
"I fear you are right," Mr Fuchs said thoughtfully.&#xD;
"Very well. To make him safe, we must not only keep this&#xD;
case out of court, but even destroy the will."&#xD;
'KNot just now Charlie?"&#xD;
"No, not just now, With your permission I shall show it to&#xD;
Mr. Fox on his return, to convince him, that its suppression is in&#xD;
his favor."&#xD;
"Yes, he will see, that he owes his security to our generosity."&#xD;
"It isn't that, father., Only in case the thing should ever  eak&#xD;
out, I want an interested witness, to testify to the fairness of our&#xD;
action. As to generosity, I shall even go a step further if you&#xD;
permit it."S&#xD;

"What step do you mean?"&#xD;
"I shall allow him the twenty five thousand Dollars as his share&#xD;
of the noney. He may secretly blame his misfortune on me, be-&#xD;
cause I did not inform him of his superintendent's action. The&#xD;
sum mentioned covers all the losses and I shall feel easier by re-&#xD;
pairing them."&#xD;
"But Dolores has to be consulted."&#xD;
"I have her sanction, father."&#xD;
"Well I shall not withhold mine. After once abandoning legal&#xD;
grounds we cannot any longer be governed by legal scruples, or&#xD;
I would say, that Dolores as a minor, has no right to give away&#xD;
anything."&#xD;
"She may be minor as to years; but her mind is riper, father,&#xD;
than that of many an older woman."&#xD;
"I think so too, and therefore have no objection."&#xD;
"So the matter is tolerably well settled. The only point, about&#xD;
which we have to come to an understanding is-Henry's. interest&#xD;
in this affair."&#xD;
"He must be kept in total ignorance about it" Mr. Fuchs, said&#xD;
readily.&#xD;
"I say so too, father. The knowledge of so much money at our&#xD;
disposal .would be an encouragement of his evil inclinations. He&#xD;
has not at all improved since his uncle's arrival and it is partly&#xD;
on his account, that I made uncle Jacob's immediate departure a&#xD;
feature of our contract. I shall accompany him to Boston and&#xD;
there buy him bills of exchange on Frankfort."&#xD;
"That is'a good idea. I cannot say that I hate my brother, but&#xD;
his-departure will take a burden from my heart. He would ruin&#xD;
Henry beyond a doubt."&#xD;
"And hold -Mrs. Fox' reputation at his mercy."&#xD;
"Dear me! I never thought of that. Yes, my son, you man-&#xD;
aged very well; but tell me, did you inform your mother of all&#xD;
this?"&#xD;
"No fatherII did not, simply because I lacked the time to do it."&#xD;
"Then you intend to tell her?"&#xD;
"Surely, father. I am proud to say, my mother is no gossip.&#xD;
She can be trusted."&#xD;
"Certainly she can and ought to. Had I better tell her, while&#xD;
you are absent?"&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       149&#xD;
"No, father, I think, I shall find leisure to tell her all to night.&#xD;
But it is getting late; come let us go.,'&#xD;
He seized his hat and the two were on the point of leaving,&#xD;
when Charles suddenly grasped his father's arm.&#xD;
"Father, tell me, did Wood use the larger safe ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Charlie: why do you ask?"&#xD;
"Were there two keys to it, as to the smaller one?&#xD;
"I see what you are driving at: no Charlie I never saw but one:&#xD;
but even if there were two-you do not think that he'd be bold&#xD;
enough to venture here?"&#xD;
"A rogue like him is bold enough to d0 anything. I'll caution&#xD;
the watchman, before I go."&#xD;
On crossing the yard, they found that individual smoking his&#xD;
pipe.&#xD;
"Josiah, have you got a revolver with you?" Charles addressed&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"No Sir, I hain't. No use for one, is there?"&#xD;
"Well I don't know. You are aware that Mr. Wood and-George&#xD;
ran off with a large sum of money?"&#xD;
"They tell me so, Sir."&#xD;
"Well, the scoundrels are bold enough, to do most anything.&#xD;
Do you know how to use a revolver?"&#xD;
"I kind o' like handled one one'st or twiste."&#xD;
"Very well; just come along and I'll lend you mine. I want&#xD;
you to have a particular eye upon the office. There are valuable&#xD;
books and papers there, thatMr. Fox wouldn't miss for a good&#xD;
bit. I shall be absent for a few days and if you'll promise to take&#xD;
good care of things generally and the office particularly, I shall&#xD;
not mind a few dollars, to pay you for your trouble when I return.'&#xD;
"Exactly Sir, jist give me the shootin' iron and I. warrant you,&#xD;
there won't be nobody a goin in to yer offlee, without'payin' toll."&#xD;
When they reached the cottage, Charles ran in and a minute&#xD;
afterwards returned with a revolver, which he handed to the watch-&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"So!" lie said to his father, after the custos had withdrawn. "I&#xD;
shall now start with a lighter heart. It isn't very likely, he'll ever&#xD;
show his face again at Foxville but-foreseen is forewarned."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
A JOURNEY.&#xD;
Charles did find time, that evening, to see his mother privately.&#xD;
If what she heard from him filled her with great astonishment, it&#xD;
certainly cured her of her wonder at her brother-in-law's move-&#xD;
ments. She understood them well now and enjoyed them still&#xD;
better; for ,she too had noticed his influence over Henry and knew&#xD;
that it would hardly have the tendency of making her son any&#xD;
better. For that reason--although she regretted to lose Charles&#xD;
even for a few days-she readily approved of all his actions and&#xD;
especially of his intended journey. Their interview had occupied&#xD;
so much time, that he found no opportunity of exchanging with&#xD;
Dolores more than a rapid farewell. before retiring to bed.&#xD;
"Mother will tell you all" he whispered as he passed her and&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs. had indeed voluntered to set her perfectly au fait in&#xD;
regard to the late development of affairs, So he parted with an&#xD;
easy heart. Mr. Fuchs had hitched his horse to the light spring-&#xD;
wagon and sat already on the frontseat, whip in hand when Charlie&#xD;
and Jacob left the house, stopping a moment on the porch, to&#xD;
shake hands and saying good bye-the latter most likely for ever.&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs was to drive the two to the station and it must be&#xD;
confessed, that uncle Jacob cut a much nicer figure on departing&#xD;
than he had done on arriving. His brother had given him a good&#xD;
travelling trunk and such articles of clothing as he could spare&#xD;
himself or procure in the village.&#xD;
*At the -factory they'stopped a moment, to take from the office&#xD;
a small but very heavy valise. It took Charles' entire strength to&#xD;
lift it on the wagon and the watchman could not help wondering&#xD;
at a weight so out of proportion to the size.&#xD;
"I   alculate that's part of them birds, we got the other day.&#xD;
It's no wonder he wouldn't fancy to have anybody hook that there&#xD;
breed. But- rest easy, sar, rest ye interely easy: I and this&#xD;
shootin' iron shall do our dewty."-&#xD;
Charles was.glad, when the factory was left behind. It was&#xD;
early yet, the fog and sunlight battling for the mastery. The&#xD;
scenery was pretty enough fantastic, forms of fog varying with&#xD;
everi- minute. Now this misty veil showed through a sudden rent&#xD;
a handsome farm with fields, meadows and orchards; anda minute&#xD;
afterwards the rent was sowed up by rapid spirit hands and a new&#xD;
&#xD;
251&#xD;
&#xD;
one made through with a forest, a creek, a rivulet displayed them-&#xD;
selves to the eyes of the travellers. The distance was a short one,&#xD;
not more than three n'iiles and the stout pacer of-Mr. Fuchs soon&#xD;
took them over it, landing them safely at the depot. They were&#xD;
just in time for the morning train. Charles had to use all his&#xD;
strength to preserve an easy gait while carrying his carpetbag.&#xD;
At the cars he feared to to be compelled to leave it in the baggage-&#xD;
car-but no. Nobody hindered him in taking it to his seat-it&#xD;
was so small, so insignificant. It would be in nobody's way.&#xD;
"The cars for Boston will leave in five minutes!"  It is time&#xD;
for Mr. Fuchs to say good bye. An earnest "God bless you!" to&#xD;
his son, a "happy journey !" to his brother and he leaves the car&#xD;
and standing outside at the window watches the two, until the&#xD;
bell begins to ring and the train to set it self in motion. Looking&#xD;
after it, he remains five minutes without stirring from the place.&#xD;
He meditates without endeavoring to get a clear impression of&#xD;
his thoughts. Oily this he knows: he feels no sorrow at the&#xD;
parting from a brother, whom he is not very likely to ever see&#xD;
again. He also knows, that this brother is even more indifferent,&#xD;
gazing with feverish impatience towards the hour that will put&#xD;
him in possession of the dear, the long-coveted thousands.&#xD;
But his horse is before the depot ; so he goes and jumping on&#xD;
the wagon, whips him into a faster gait, in order to forget -his&#xD;
thoughts by the rapid motion."&#xD;
The train also shoots forward, increasing its speed from second&#xD;
to second, until at last it reaches its maximum rapidity and then,&#xD;
as it' were, with suspendedbreath hurries the passengers over hill&#xD;
and dale-yea even through the bowels of the earth.&#xD;
Towns are reached and left behind; big forests passed, which&#xD;
in consequence of the rapid passage appear as mere groves, fit for&#xD;
Sunday-school picnics. Cows grazing in a string along the rail-&#xD;
way, are by rapidity condensed in herds of such magnitude, that&#xD;
we wonder how one farmer manages to milk so many and what in&#xD;
the world he does with 'all the milk and cream and butter.&#xD;
At length darkness descends npon the earth. It throws its&#xD;
veil over all the country around us. We know there is something&#xD;
there though and a second afterwards something else and we feel&#xD;
oppressed at the thought of tIe existence of so many things, of&#xD;
which we fail to form the slightest idea. But this too does'not&#xD;

last long. We are tired of thinking and closing our eyes, man-&#xD;
age to snatch a few moments of slumber, from wv hich however&#xD;
every shrill whistle awakens us, causing us to start and wonder,&#xD;
whether the steam pipe will not soon whistle for our station.&#xD;
Nothing is eternal on earth; even a day's journey on the. rail&#xD;
road comes to a terminus. Even? I hear my reader ask. Yes}&#xD;
even; or has it entirely passed his or her observation that our im-&#xD;
patience increases in the exact ratio of our means of gratifying&#xD;
it? Who ever thought of grumbling about slow speed in the days&#xD;
of canal-boats and stage-coaches? oiOly since railroads have&#xD;
started into vogue, it has become the fashion to be impatient and&#xD;
lament over the loss of half.-an-hour, as if it were the last one at&#xD;
the disposal of the traveller and badly needed, to make his-peace&#xD;
with heaven.&#xD;
But to repeat it. Charles and his uncle reached Boston iii&#xD;
safety; but at an hour when even in great cities people begin to&#xD;
seek nobody's company but that of their pillow. Charles hap-&#xD;
pened to recollect the name of the hotel, which Mr. Fox was in&#xD;
the habit of frequenting on his trips to Boston and seeuring a&#xD;
carriage ordered the driver to take them there.  Fortunately&#xD;
there was room in the house and the young man secured two ad-&#xD;
joining apartments for himself and his uncle. Jacob didn't like&#xD;
the arrangement; thought it was much more simple to take one&#xD;
room with two beds; but Charles ventured to differ and intima-&#xD;
ting that it wouldn't answer to make a change so late in the night,&#xD;
got his worthy relative to acquiesce in the arrangement. But why&#xD;
did he hold his uncle that way at a distance? Was he afraid&#xD;
of him? No, not exactly afraid; but their sojourn in Boston&#xD;
might last several days and the young man intagined that cir-&#xD;
cumstances might arise, which would male it desirable, to have&#xD;
a private.retreat into which Mr. Jacob could not stick his prying&#xD;
proboscis without permission&#xD;
Charles was an early riser. In spite of yesterday's fatigue he&#xD;
was ready for breakfast, while uncle Jacob still snored away with&#xD;
a skill of such as only long practise can give. So the young man&#xD;
went down-stairs and after taking his breakfast went to the clerk&#xD;
in the office, to enter his name and that of his companion.&#xD;
"Has Mr. Fox lately been here?;' he asked the clerk.&#xD;
&#xD;

"I wanted to see Mr. Ruby on business; but since he is absent&#xD;

"Brillant, Sir, is my name."&#xD;
"Well Mr..Brillant,'I have by Inheritance become heir of a fire&#xD;
selection of diamonds, which I should like to dispose of. I need&#xD;
the money more than the jewels, besides being no great admirer&#xD;
of trinkets of that kind&#xD;
"Have you got the stones with you'?"&#xD;
"Yes, Sir. I have some of them. I was afraid to carry a&#xD;
larger number on account of the insecurity of larger-cities such&#xD;
as Boston."&#xD;
Mr..Brillant took the box and opened it.  On perceiving the&#xD;
stones, he started: that was more than he had expected. He had&#xD;
seldom seen a more brilliant selection of diamonds and yet this&#xD;
young man said, they were only a part of those in his possession.&#xD;
The enthusiast for once got the better of the shrewd business&#xD;
man and he said:&#xD;
"My dear Sir, do you know, that you have a fine selection of&#xD;
diamonds there. Your relative must have been a pretty rich fel-&#xD;
low, to leave you such diamonds?"&#xD;
"He was an old bachelor and a queer kind of a fellow. I never&#xD;
knew him.personally, but those that did, tell me, that he was fond&#xD;
of collecting them."&#xD;
"May I request your name Sir Y"&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
.Because we could hardly venture on so large a purchase with-&#xD;
out knowing the name of the owner and receiving some good re--&#xD;
ference. They might be... .".'&#xD;
"Stolen?" Charles continued, when the other hesitated, half&#xD;
vexed, half amused at the idea.&#xD;
"Do I look like a thief, Sir?"&#xD;
"No, Sir,.you do not and you must pardon my straiglitforwhrd-&#xD;
ness. But we cannot always take a person's looks as an index&#xD;
for his character and if you had been bitten as often as we, Sir.&#xD;
you would not only find our caution excusable but even neces-&#xD;
sary."&#xD;
Charles'muted a moment.     S&#xD;
"Do you happen to know a certain Mr. Fox of Foxville, State&#xD;
of 'Maine?"-&#xD;
"Mr. Edward Fox, owner of a Cutlery-factory?"&#xD;
"The very same" Charles said greatly relieved at the thought&#xD;
&#xD;
of being able now, to refer to him, "Would.&#xD;
answer your purpose, even if I prefer to maintainhmy&#xD;
"Perfectly Sir.'',pee"omina                 ynontp&#xD;

kindness to send this to its address, you'llave sasfave in&#xD;
less than ten minutes."&#xD;
Mr. Brilliant called a boy, ordering him to carry the letter to&#xD;
the address and wait for an answer. Then he resumed his exami-&#xD;
nation of the stones and was still engaged with that agreeable&#xD;
pastime when the boy returned with an answer. On opening it,&#xD;
Mr. Brillan t read as follows :&#xD;

Mr. Brillant scratched his head:&#xD;
"Fifty thousand dollars are no child's play. Can you wait till&#xD;

"I can."&#xD;
"Then the stones are mine. Here, take them and if you will&#xD;
call about twelve o'clock, you will find me ready to pay you."&#xD;
"I don't want the stones with me" Charles replied. "A due&#xD;
note to'the full amount answers my purpose."&#xD;
Mt. ,Brillant wrote the note and Charles after pocketing it,&#xD;
withdrew from the store. He hurried back to the hotel and tak-&#xD;
ing his carpet-bag with him, was going to start on a second expe-&#xD;
dition when the clerk stopped him.&#xD;
"The gentleman, who arrived with you, seems to be in great&#xD;
tribulation about your absence. He talks a language I do not&#xD;
understand-German I believe-and perhaps you had better see&#xD;
him a moment, just to put him at his ease.".&#xD;
Charles laughed.&#xD;
"The old fool !" he cried. "Have you nobody in the house,&#xD;
that speaks his language?"&#xD;
"One of the waiters does, Sir."&#xD;
"Well then, just tell him to bear with me for one more hour.&#xD;
If I go up, I'll never disengage myself again. The old fellow is&#xD;
a perfect sticking plaster."&#xD;
"Very well, Sir, I'll do your bidding."&#xD;
Charles left the house andl walking down street, entered the of-&#xD;
fice of the first private king house, he came to.&#xD;
"What do you pay for doubloons?" he asked a man behind the&#xD;
counter.&#xD;
The banker stated the price.&#xD;
"Do you feel disposed to buy any?"&#xD;
"As many as you have" the man said with a smile.&#xD;
Charles opened his valise and as he pulled out bag after bag&#xD;
and placed them in a line on the counter the countenance of the&#xD;
banker gradually became more respectful. So it is in the world.&#xD;
They dont value us according to what we are, but what we have&#xD;
and their faces, like thermometers, indicate the degree of respect&#xD;
which, according to their opinion, corresponds with our means.&#xD;

room was left upon the latch and he could hear,, how the old gen-&#xD;
tleman lamented in his native tongue to some one within.&#xD;
"The young rogue!" he heard him cry "to leave his poor uncle&#xD;
in such a fix! To leave him in a strange town, in a strange hot,&#xD;
with no means to pay expenses! I might have known, it would&#xD;
come to this, old fool that I was; yes, 1 might have known from&#xD;
oaed me. But it shall cost him dear, this joke&#xD;
upon his uncle. I shall without delay walk back to Foxville and&#xD;
have him arrested for false pretenses, yes for swindling."&#xD;
That was as much as Charles wanted to hear. Pushing the&#xD;
door open with an energetic jerk, he rapidly stepped into the room&#xD;
and stood before his uncle with brows contracted and Aflashing&#xD;
eye, that portended little good to the whining adventurer. In&#xD;
fact he stopped as suddenly as if a slap had shut his mouth; his&#xD;
figure assumed a bent posture and his hands were clasped partly&#xD;
in astonishment, partly in supplication.&#xD;
Charles was on the point of giving way to his indignation; but&#xD;
the presence of the waiter caused him to check himself.&#xD;
"Please Sir, have the kindness to leave us for a moment" he&#xD;
said to the servant and only when the main had obeyed his injunc-&#xD;
tion, he addressed his uncle.&#xD;
"What does this farce signify ? he said sternly. "Am I to in-&#xD;
fer from your conduct, that you liave gone crazy? Indeed i no&#xD;
other way can I explain to myself this ridiculous conduct."&#xD;
"Now Charlie, please, don't be mad. I thought,-I feared-"&#xD;
"Say nothing more, Sir, for I fear that your thoughts embod-&#xD;
ied a gross insult to myself. I ask no excuses Sir; but this I say,&#xD;
'if you once more conduct yourself in this disgraceful manner, Itat&#xD;
shall at once leave you to your fate and take good care too,&#xD;
the door of my father's house will not be opened again to you."&#xD;
Uncle Jacob was completely cowed. Charles looked at his&#xD;
watch: it was exactly twelve o'cl ck.&#xD;
"Take your hat Sir and come w th me" he said in the same stern&#xD;
tone. "I shall buy the drafts I promised you and then- dispatch&#xD;
you without delay. There is but little pleasure in your company.&#xD;
Uncle Jacob took his hat and silently followed Charles down&#xD;
stairs. The clerk tried to catch a glance of intelligence from the&#xD;
young man; but Charles was not at all willing to make him a&#xD;

party of thissembroglio and therefore passed him without vouch-&#xD;
safing him a single look.&#xD;
"Proud like the dickens !" the clerk muttered to himself. "I&#xD;
shouldn't Wonder, if that poor old gentleman had good reasons&#xD;
for his lamentations after all. If the trunk wasn't here, I would&#xD;
present the bill at once."&#xD;
Inconsistent Mr. Clerk! You are not the only individual, that&#xD;
measures the character of others by the scale of his sensitiveness&#xD;
A man is a perfect gentleman, if he smiles on you; but if he steps&#xD;
by chance upon your corn, he is a low-bred pup.&#xD;
Fortunately for Charles the remarks of e pup&#xD;
him. Walking rapidly he soon reached the clerk who affect&#xD;
chasd hi diaonds  Mr  ubhe jeweler, who had pur-&#xD;
chased his diamonds. Mr. Ruby was present now and compli-&#xD;
mented the stranger on the possession of such nice stones. Af-&#xD;
ter redeeming their note and receiving the receipt ofalCharlesste  the&#xD;
dealers requested him to call on them first in case he shouldsh&#xD;
to dispose of his other stones. Th  he prmse a  hulefwish&#xD;
the store, followed more than accompanied by his uncle, who&#xD;
found difficulty in keeping up with his nephew's rapid ste, an&#xD;
yet shunned to remonstrate with him. p&#xD;
All at once Charles stopped. He had discover&#xD;
attracted his attention. It read :&#xD;

A circular pasted to the show window informed the public, that&#xD;
the splendid Steamer "Sea-serpent" wouldleave for ntwirpea&#xD;

"To what amount would you want the bills ?" the clerk in-&#xD;
"Forty nine thousand Dollars in favor of Jacob Fuchs" Charles&#xD;
p   saying as many notes on the counter.&#xD;
The clerk smiled. They don't charge for smile's in money.in.&#xD;

surpass themselves. Charles had his bills in less than ten min-&#xD;
utes.&#xD;
"Now the state-room" he said.&#xD;
"Exactly Sir. You can have your choice. Here is No. 28.&#xD;
which I can recommend to you with a good conscience, because I&#xD;
once made the trip in it myself."&#xD;
"Let it be 28 then."&#xD;
"What name Sir?"&#xD;
"Jacob Fuchs."&#xD;
"One hundred dollars Sir, if you please. Thank you. Here is&#xD;
your ticket. You had better send your baggage to the vessel at&#xD;
once."&#xD;
"I shall, Sir. Good day."&#xD;
"Now for the trunk and then to the vessel."&#xD;
At the hotel Charles settled his uncle's bill and then ordered a&#xD;
carriage.&#xD;
"You forgot to pay your own bill" the clerk said somewhat in-,&#xD;
pudently.&#xD;
"I do not intend, to leave as yet."&#xD;
"That makes no difference. It is our custom to collect the&#xD;
fare in -advance, where there is no baggage to secure it-"&#xD;
Charles pitched him a hundred dollar note.&#xD;
"I commend your caution" he said derisively. "It speaks well&#xD;
for the class of guests you deal with. Does that suffice as secur-&#xD;
ity ?"&#xD;
The Clerk was as susceptible to the influence of money as other&#xD;
persons. Besides Charles had spoken haughtily and it is the&#xD;
privilege of nabobs to order their fellowmen about. Handing&#xD;
back the money he said:&#xD;
"Never mind Sir, about the money. We can afford to make an&#xD;
exception in your case."&#xD;
"But I cannot afford to accept a favor from you, Sir. - Keep&#xD;
the bill until we settle."&#xD;
The clerk felt cheap, when Charles left the office.&#xD;
"He must be something big" the consistant logical muttered&#xD;
to himself.&#xD;
ItWas a fact however: Charles had the airs of a duke.&#xD;
Away the carriage rolled, landing them in due time at the pier&#xD;
where the Sea-serpent lay at anchor. Entrusting the trunk to a&#xD;

"tSit down Sir" the young man said, accompanying his words&#xD;
with a motion of his hand and taking chair himself "I want to&#xD;

Uncle Jacob had not yet recovered from his depression; so he&#xD;

"Here are 49,000.00 Dolxpetato-&#xD;
"He -Dollars in bills of exchange" the youu&#xD;

"Yes Charlie so it does. You are a good lad and I hope .."&#xD;
aI hope that you will abstain from hoping anything at all. We&#xD;

"Yes Charlie I know.&#xD;

be responsible for any loses you may sustain."&#xD;
"I shall stay on board, my boy. I am too glad to have reached&#xD;
it,to leave it again this side of the Atlantic."&#xD;
'Very Well. You will no longer need me now, and I may as&#xD;
wish you a pleasant voyage and retire."&#xD;
"Won't you shake hands Charlie?" Jacob said reproachfully.&#xD;
"If it gives you any satisfaction why not?"&#xD;
Charles spoke and shook hands with equal coldness. He could&#xD;
not force himself to feign a sorrow he did not feel. His uncle's&#xD;
character had filled him with extreme disgust.&#xD;
Sodthey parted. Charles sincerely hoped for ever. He had or-&#xD;
dered the cabman to wait for him and now rapidly drove to the&#xD;
hotel. It was near dinner-time and Mr. Fox at home. Charles&#xD;
knocked at his door and on the inmate's "Come in!" entered. Mr&#xD;
Fox sat on a lounge; but Charles was frightened at the great&#xD;
change, which the days of their separation had produced on his&#xD;
face. The furrows on the forehead had deepened and the cheeks&#xD;
looked pale and hollow. The lipv&#xD;
hun d- - ps, not over-firm before, now&#xD;
hung down with an expression of utter helplessness. On erceiv-&#xD;

you ever since the reception of your note. Was my reply of any&#xD;

"Confidence? Ah Charlie, I wish I could trust all the world as&#xD;

"The world seems to haednt     ogy&#xD;
You look pale and haggard."&#xD;
"The world is the world Charlie. It smiles upon the prosper-&#xD;
ous; it frowns upon the unfortunate. It frowns upon me, my boy,&#xD;
at present ; that tells the whole story."&#xD;
"You have not been successful then in your endeavors ?"&#xD;
"They have been worse than failures, Charlie. This Italian&#xD;
war has made money so tight, that affairs have much the appear--&#xD;
ance of a panic. I have tried every means to raise the ne essary&#xD;
money, but I have failed. Everybody has treated me with such a&#xD;
strange distrust, that I sometimes have felt inclined to see more&#xD;
of it, than the general suspicion incident to times of panic."&#xD;
"Mr. Wood's doings." Charles suggested.&#xD;
"I shouldn't wonder; indeed I have thought so too. But that&#xD;
fact does not much alter things. I cannot pay my debts: I lack&#xD;
the means to carry on the factory and the sale of my property un-&#xD;
der very disadvantageous circumstances rises before my mind as&#xD;
an unavoidable calamity."&#xD;
"Is the want of money the only thing that troubles you? Par-&#xD;
don the question Mr. Fox, since it is dictated by the most sincere&#xD;
sympathy."&#xD;
"I know my boy, I know that very well" Mr. Fox said earn-&#xD;
estly seizing and pressing Charlie's hand. "I wish ovidence&#xD;
had bestowed upon me the gift of such a son. Indeed i gives me&#xD;
pleasure to think of you as one related by the ties of consan-&#xD;
guinity."&#xD;
"Then Mr. Fox you will relate to me all that troubles you?&#xD;
Perhaps I can relieve you more than you may think."&#xD;
Mr. Fox shook his head.&#xD;
That is hardly possible, my boy. My other sorrows are sor-&#xD;
rows of the heart and engendered by the unworthy conduct of my&#xD;
family: Do you understand me now?"&#xD;
"I do Sir, but yet I do not despair of offering effective consola--&#xD;

"You allude to Mrs. Fox? Ah Charlie-ma-not-in&#xD;
-   ali mynom this instance&#xD;

Charles started.&#xD;
"Mr. Fox" he said with somewhat of reproach in his tones "you&#xD;
cannot really desire the death of a repentant sinner?"&#xD;
"She is repentant then?" he asked with averted looks.&#xD;
"Not so much in words as actions. We have managed to im-&#xD;
press her with the belief, that the causes of her sickness are n-&#xD;
known to all but her. This has quickened her recoveryand un-&#xD;
doubtedly engendered her resolution to bury the l yast in oblivion&#xD;
and begin a new life."&#xD;
He stopped as if expecting a question on the part of Mr. Fox,&#xD;
but when the gentleman preserved his silence, Charles continued:&#xD;
"aer former aversion to Dolores has suddenly changed into so&#xD;
ardent an affection as even to arouse the jealousy of gentle Lucy.&#xD;
Indeed Dolores had to remain with her (lay and nigtandtohe&#xD;

Mr. Fox became interested against his will.&#xD;
"And Dolores?" he inquired.&#xD;
"Has conducted herself in this affair with the strange good tact,&#xD;
she always shows. She nurses Mrs. Fox with the love and pat-&#xD;
ience of a daughter and has even influenced Lucy's stubbornness&#xD;
when she refused to pardon her erring mother."&#xD;
Mr. Fox groaned.&#xD;
"That is the point Charlie !" he cried "the thorn  my s&#xD;
that turns my foot into poison and makes my nights sleepless.&#xD;
Thus to be deceived by the mate of my house and bed! To have&#xD;
the honor of my name sullied before the eyes of&#xD;

"My dear Sir, will you tolerate the advise and consolation of&#xD;

"Speak, my boy."&#xD;

"Yes Doctor Palmer is true."&#xD;
"Very well. Henry fortunately was asleep at the time of the&#xD;
the accident and the only dangerous witness has just taken the&#xD;
steamer for Europe."4&#xD;
"What do you mean?" Mr. Fox inquired with a start.&#xD;
"My uncle Jacob. We have induced him to return to his native.&#xD;
country. That is only one of the many strange events I have to&#xD;
tell you. But everythfng in due time. At present let me return&#xD;
to the poor patient at our house. We have all buried the occur-&#xD;
rence in the deepest recess of our soul: Mr. Fox could you not&#xD;
do the same? Could you not pardon the poor lady's offense and&#xD;
allow her to open a new record? I know well enough, that you&#xD;
are a deeply injured man ; but from what my mother says, there&#xD;
has been such a radical change in Mrs. Fox, that there is no doubt&#xD;
of much happiness in store for you, if yo can only overcome a re-&#xD;
sentment, which, though natural, is neither christian nor politic.'&#xD;
"You are a warm advocate Charlie" Mr. Fox said with a smile,&#xD;
that drove much of the former gloom away from his countenance&#xD;
'but you ask impossiblities. A man cannot change his heart in&#xD;
the twinkling of an eye. All I'll promise you, is to make the&#xD;
effort to forget."&#xD;
"I ask no more. But in regard to the new state of affairs?"&#xD;
"Of course I'll recognize them. The future will much depend&#xD;
from her conduct."&#xD;
"Then I predict a happy solution. But Mr. Fox there is another&#xD;
sore spot, you haven't touched as yet. Let me spare you the pain&#xD;
by stating that "Richard" is its name."&#xD;
Mr. Fox nodded.&#xD;
"Is he really getting so bad?"&#xD;
"Yes, I have been obliged to listen to a long record of shame&#xD;
and sin on my arrival here" Mr. Fox said with a sigh. "His em-&#xD;

"That is'too bad indeed. How may he manage to exist with.&#xD;

shook them heartily and said:&#xD;
"Charles, you are a greater jewel; than any your ancestor left&#xD;
you in his will. Without you-what would I be to-day? By re&#xD;
ceiving my wife into your house, you saved my honor, at least be-&#xD;
fore the world. By plundering your own inheritance you sus-&#xD;
tained my sinking fortune. What I am to-day, is your work-&#xD;
Charles how can I ever pay this debt of gratitude."&#xD;
The bright tears ran down the cheeks of Mr. Fox. It is en1-&#xD;
barrassing to see a man weep and Charles therefore cried:&#xD;
"Now please, don't Mr. Fox, I cannot stand it.--Y ou have borne&#xD;
misfortune like a hero-don't let good luck unman you now."&#xD;
"You are right, Charlie, right in this as in everything," r.&#xD;

"But now come at once and let me write you an acknowledge~&#xD;

"Never mind the sum. My father, and Dolores could not think&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
A EAN HUNT.&#xD;
Charles, young as he was, readily saw the reason, why Mr. Fox&#xD;
had thus far failed, to find any track of Richard. He had merely&#xD;
made underhand inquiries ; that is he had searched a pin in the&#xD;
river, while standing on shore. There are only two ways of find-&#xD;
ing the frequenter of dens of vice. One of them is, to pay the&#xD;
police for lending you their eyes and the other-and far the surest&#xD;
is to use your own. So while Charles humored his friend in see-&#xD;
onding his efforts helept his own counsel and, at night, when&#xD;
3Mr. Fox had retired to bed, started on expeditious of his Own&#xD;
He hard read enough about large cities to know that criminals&#xD;
and adventurers, who live on their wits, and devotees of low and&#xD;
obscene pleasure seek the night as naturally, as the owls of his&#xD;
native forest in pursuit of their game. He knew moreover, that&#xD;
the frequentation of their dens were even more dangerous at&#xD;
night, than during daylight; but that could not deter him from&#xD;
his purpose. Armed with a small revolver, which could easily be&#xD;
concealed in his breast.pocket and with a cane of solid material&#xD;
he set out on his mission. Night after night he hunted the groo--&#xD;
shops, the dancing-houses, the brothels of Boston; but evidently&#xD;
to no avail. A week passed without bringing the least clue of&#xD;
the lost son and Mr. Fox falling back into his previous despond-&#xD;
ency, declared any further efforts useless and reminded Charles of&#xD;
the necessity of returning to Foxville. In vain the young man&#xD;
demonstrated the desirableness of prolonging their researches-&#xD;
Mr. Fox hrd become so crabbed in consequence of his late mis-&#xD;
fortunes. that he was difficult to manage and disinclined to hu-&#xD;
nor Charlie's wishes.&#xD;
"Very well" he finally answered his persuasions. "I give you&#xD;
one more day. If we fail to discover any trace within that time&#xD;
I shall give him up for lost and return to Foxvilie without him.&#xD;
A father cannot be expected, to make himself a slave for the sake&#xD;
of a degenerate son,"&#xD;
Charles had to content himself with this reply; but he resolved&#xD;
to make the most of this respite and to secure the assistance of a&#xD;
skilled detective. On inquiry he learned, that a certain Mr'. Sly&#xD;
Possessed the greatest reputation in that branch of business.&#xD;
Mr. Sly might be found at the headquarters, if not engaged lie&#xD;

he was informed and going there, Charles was so fortunate to find&#xD;
his man. Mr. Sly took him to his office and inquired about his&#xD;
errand.&#xD;
Charles drew a ten dollar-note out of his pocket and handed it&#xD;
to the detective.&#xD;
"Please to accept this as a token of my consideration. If you&#xD;
can help me in the accomplishment of my purpose, I shall give&#xD;
you ten times that sum."&#xD;
Mr..Sly replied, that it would give him pleasure to assist so con-&#xD;
siderate a gentleman, and, thanks to the ten, lie meant what he&#xD;
said.&#xD;
Charles proceeded to state the nature of his wishes. He also&#xD;
stated, that he had scoured all the dens of Boston for a week,&#xD;
without even the shadow of success and that he thought he could&#xD;
use the remaining day to no better purpose, than to renew his re-&#xD;
searches under the guidance of Mr. Sly.&#xD;
The detective meditated for a minute. Then lie asked:&#xD;
"How old is the lad?"&#xD;
"About seventeen."&#xD;
"His name ?"&#xD;
"Richard Fox."&#xD;
"Formerly employed by Steel &amp;amp; Co. you say?"&#xD;
"Yes Sir."&#xD;
"That firm could give no clue to his whereabouts?"&#xD;
"No, Sir, they hadn't seen him for 6 months."&#xD;
"Had he any passions? any favorite pastime while at home?"'&#xD;
Charles started. That thought had never struck him.&#xD;
"Yes, Sir, he was a complete jockey. He was only happy, when&#xD;
in the stable or on horseback."&#xD;
"That is important, Sir. I know a livery man that deals with&#xD;
all the fops and dandies of the City. If it suits your pleasure,&#xD;
Sir, we shall go to see him."&#xD;
Charles answered by taking his hat.&#xD;
"Mr. Sly, my purse is at your service" he said "don't hesitate&#xD;
to take a carriage, whenever you deem it desirable."&#xD;
"Yours is a wise policy, Sir. By using the horses legs instead&#xD;
of yours, you'll double your time Hoh! Jimmy ! this way!"&#xD;
Jimmy was a driver and obeyed the summons and a minute&#xD;

"Mr. Fuchs, glad to see you. What can I do for you?"&#xD;
"That's easily stated.  Mr. Fuchs is in quest of a voung&#xD;

"Very flattering, Mr. Sly, but yet correct. Please may I ask&#xD;
the name of your relation?"&#xD;
"Richard Fox of Maine."&#xD;
"Handsome youth of seventeen, slender frame, fair hair mus-&#xD;
tache in the actof sprouting?"&#xD;
"The very man" Charles eagerly exclaimed. "Can you give us&#xD;
any clue to his whereabouts?"&#xD;
"Sorry to say no. Hasn't been here these three weeks. Out&#xD;
of cash, I suppose, couldn't pay for the last horse, he hired.&#xD;

Mr. Dash hesitated a moment.&#xD;
"See here, S yI  lout a  mnt.&#xD;

*Three cheers for yer-honor!" Jimmy shouted and away the&#xD;
cab flew with commendable speed.&#xD;
"Here we are!" Jimmy cried, stopping the carriage and opening&#xD;
th'e door. "Up that flight of stairs, you can't miss it."&#xD;
"All right Jimmy."&#xD;
Sly and Charles ascended the flight of stairs and soon discov-&#xD;
ered a sign with the actor's name on a backdoor.&#xD;
"Come in !" a merry voice answered the knock at the door&#xD;
"How do you do, gents ? Take a chair and excuse me for failing&#xD;
to rise. I am lame just now."&#xD;
"Lame Mr. Burlesque? I am sorry to hear it and so will the&#xD;
public be. I dont see what they'll do without Mr. Burlesque, to&#xD;
set their laughing muscles a going."&#xD;
"Oh, Sir, it isn't as bad as that!" the actor cried. "You see&#xD;
my lameness merely affects my pocket. I am out of boots, out&#xD;
of pants, out of linen,-in short, I am out of sorts."&#xD;
"But how do you manage to play?"&#xD;
"Oh, my wardrobe is good enough for lamplight yet. In that&#xD;
cravat I was a king last night. But these Bostonians are so con-&#xD;
foundedly particular, that they would cry : "stone him!" if I dared&#xD;
to make my appearance on State Street in this fashion." -&#xD;
"But when do you eat?" Charles inquired. He was so amused&#xD;
at the light-hearted son of Thalia, that for a, moment he forgot&#xD;
his -object.&#xD;
"At night, Sir, on whatever I can get, and that is deuced little.&#xD;
Romance, Sir, is getting scarcer every day and soon the happy&#xD;
days will be a reminiscence of the past, when a fellow could get&#xD;
an oyster supper and a bottle of claret without paying for it."&#xD;
"You are painting darkly Sir. I should like you to look at&#xD;
things from a brighter point of view: would you have any objec-&#xD;
tion to a small loan, to put you in ondition, to appear before the&#xD;
public in becoming decornm?" -&#xD;
The actor raised himself upon one elbow.&#xD;
"Mr. Sly, just have the kindness to touch that gentleman's&#xD;
shoulder. Is he real"&#xD;
"Of course he is: why do you ask?"&#xD;
The comedian fell back upon his couch.&#xD;

"That is an enigma worthy of solution," he said as if in solil-&#xD;

being asked to do it."&#xD;

"Tiat may be never."&#xD;

Yes, Sir, I know the whereabouts of Dick Fox. He lives 107 -&#xD;

"Thank you Sir," Charles resumed, writing down the number&#xD;
and street. "You have done me a greater service'than you think&#xD;
and if ever you need the assistance of a friend-do you under..&#xD;
stand, a real friend, that differs from the legion you possess,-&#xD;
you call on me. Here is my name and residence."&#xD;
"I take the offer, as you give it. Have you any objections if I&#xD;
call on you before you leave town?"&#xD;
"Not the-slightest. You'll find me No. 19-Hotel. But you&#xD;
must excuse me, Sir, as I am in a great hurry to find my cousin.&#xD;
I intend to leave for home to-morrow"&#xD;
Another hearty shake and they parted. Charles was astonished&#xD;
to find so much principle and genuine honor in so gay a fellow,&#xD;
but if he had seen a little' more about the world he'would have&#xD;
found, that it is not always the sedate, portly gentleman with&#xD;
standing collar, white necktie and a goldenheaded cane, that is&#xD;
the embodiment of honor.&#xD;
The street and number were given to Jimmy and once more&#xD;
that equestrian pegasus made the wheels fly, as if he had under-&#xD;
stood the hint about the double rations. Oh the way the two de-&#xD;
liberated about the best mode of securing Richard's- voluntary&#xD;
company.&#xD;
"Burlesque spoke about debts" Mr. Sly suggested.  "How&#xD;
would it do, to take him between kind persuasions aid stern&#xD;
menaces,to press him into acquiescence?'&#xD;
"The idea is good Sir. I shall introduce you in your official&#xD;
capacity and thereby awe him into submission.&#xD;
The carriage stopped before a house of rather shabby appear-&#xD;
ance. A dirty flight of, stairs led into the second story and the&#xD;
banister was so greasy, that Charles preferred to ascend without&#xD;
its, assistance. On reaching the second floor the two examined&#xD;
the doors. There were no signs on them; but as there was only&#xD;
one leading to the rear part of the house, they knocked at it at&#xD;
random. This time they received no summons, but a step was&#xD;
heard approaching the door. A key was turned and the door&#xD;
slightly opened. The hall was dark and as the visitors could not&#xD;
be recognized, the inmate opened his door a liltle wider, to let the&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       273&#xD;
light from within fall upon their faces. Then Charles recognized&#xD;
his relative and stepping forward with a rapid step, he exclaimed.&#xD;
"Richard Fox! it is really you?"&#xD;
On hearing his name, the inmate made a rapid motion, to shut&#xD;
the door; but Charles had anticipated such a course and set his&#xD;
foot beyond the sill. At the same time he gave the. door a vig-&#xD;
orous push and thereby making it escape theaother'n grasp.&#xD;
"Charles Fuchs !" he cried with a mixture of surprise and in-&#xD;
dignation. "What does this signify? Who gives you the right&#xD;
of thus intruding into my room? Depart at once or I shall be&#xD;
compelled to eject you forcibly."&#xD;
"Richard Fox, you had better think twice before you act so&#xD;
rashly. I intrude my presence upon you in the sacred right of&#xD;
ambassador. Your father sends me here, Sir."&#xD;
The calm dignified conduct of the visitor had its effect upon&#xD;
the youth.&#xD;
"Come in then and state your errand ; but be brief if you&#xD;
please; ,I have neither the time nor the inclination, to listen to a&#xD;
speech."&#xD;
"I am not at all inclined, to make one. Your father's message&#xD;
is as short, as plain. It is embodied in two words: come home!"&#xD;
"And if I decline, to follow the injunction?"&#xD;
"I am authorized to use force. Here in this companion of&#xD;
mine you see a member of the city police."&#xD;
Richard stepped back in evident surprise.&#xD;
"We have learned of the contraction of certain debts of yours,&#xD;
Richard, which are very apt to lead you into difficulties. You&#xD;
have only the choice between wandering into prison or your&#xD;
father's arms."&#xD;
"And you, you have ferreted me out ?" the young man cried&#xD;
with flashing eyes and clenched fists. "I thank you, Sir, and hope&#xD;
the day may come, when I can pay you back."&#xD;
"These are idle threats, Richard," Charles replied with a calm;&#xD;
deportment, that gave him a great advantage over his excited ad-&#xD;
versary. "Your time you say, is measured : so is mine. You will&#xD;
oblige me by stating without delay, whether you prefer to follow&#xD;
me or this gentleman,"&#xD;
. Richard saw himself driven to the wall,&#xD;
"How will my fatlier'0receive me, if I come?"&#xD;
I8&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7070-00000139"/>&#xD;
"I guarantee you a lenient reception. To grant yot more, is&#xD;
beyond my power. It is your affair to win back your father's love."&#xD;
"Do you know, what he intends to do with me?"&#xD;
"I think he means to take you home at present; but this is not&#xD;
the time nor place to negotiate. I want your final answer.'&#xD;
"I'll go."&#xD;
"Very well, Sir. Have the kindness to prepare your luggage&#xD;
for removal."&#xD;
A flush of shame passed over Richard's features.&#xD;
"I have no luggage," he answered sullenly.&#xD;
"No other clothing?"&#xD;
"Well, then we must procure some on the way. You cannot&#xD;
appear in a beggar's garb before your father. Take your hat."&#xD;
By this time the authoritative manner of Charlie had begun to&#xD;
make an impression upon Richard and he obeyed his injunction&#xD;
without reply. When he was ready to go, Charles said to him:&#xD;
"Allow me to insinuate, that you are yet in a measure the mas-&#xD;
ter of your actions. You can make an attempt at flight if you&#xD;
choose; but in that instance, I shall withdraw my protecting hand&#xD;
from you and surrender you to my companion. He is tolerably&#xD;
expert in catching runaways and in case of capture I shouldn't&#xD;
at all wonder at half-a-dozen suits of swindling finding their way&#xD;
to .the newspapers, .I have nothing more ,to say, Sir, and you&#xD;
may now suit your pleasure. Let us go."&#xD;
Richard's spirit was completely broken. It is doubtful whether&#xD;
he would have attempted flight even on discovering that Mr. Sly&#xD;
was merely acting as a scarecrow. They went down stairs and&#xD;
entered the carriage. Jimmy had to drive first to a clothing store,&#xD;
then to a shoemaker, then to a hatter. He felt proud of the pat-&#xD;
ronage he was permitted to exercise that day. At last he had to&#xD;
drive to Charles' hotel, where he was dismissed with the promised&#xD;
double rations. That of the horse he received in cash and it is&#xD;
to be hoped, for the sake of his conscience, that he didn't cheat&#xD;
his fourlegged partner out of his dues.&#xD;
Mr. Sly took his departure at the door; Charles had managed&#xD;
to slip the stipulated sum into his hands unseen by Richard.&#xD;
That young man became more and more crestfallen as the mo-&#xD;
ment of meeting his deeply injured father approached.&#xD;
&#xD;
Charles took him first to his room.&#xD;
"Stay here, until I call you" he said to him. "IFwant to&#xD;
pare your father for your appearance."                pre-&#xD;
.    Going out he locked the door, leaving Richard as a prisoner.&#xD;
But the youth did not care; he was more afraid now of the nlock&#xD;
ing' than the lockig of the door. Charles on the other hand&#xD;
descended to Mr. Fox' room, and finding him at home, entered in&#xD;
to his presence. There was something his min, that'&#xD;
the other's attention.&#xD;
"You have found him, have you?" he exclaimed with an effort&#xD;
at calmness. But Charles saw how his lips quivered and his&#xD;
hands trembled.&#xD;
"Yes Sir," he answered, deeming it best to avoid all e&#xD;
I have found him and less depraved, that we had reason to&#xD;
"And where--where is he ?"&#xD;
"In my room Sir; but in order to overcome his reluctance, to&#xD;
follow me, I have promised, that he should finc in you aanet&#xD;
judge and father. Are you prepared to verify that promise&#xD;
Yes Charlie" Mr. Fox said softly. "I don't pretend to b&#xD;
better than the father in the parable. I am prepared to kill th&#xD;
calf, for any boy, that has been given back to me."&#xD;
Charles left without speaking another word. On reaching  h'&#xD;
room he beckoned Richard:&#xD;
"Come!"&#xD;
 The way to the room of Mr. Fox was traversed in Silence.&#xD;
Charles opened the door and pushed his trembling companion in.&#xD;
Then he shut the door-it was not meet, that this meeting should&#xD;
be profaned by the eyes "f a third party....&#xD;
....That evening a happy trio took the northern train.&#xD;

for the village. Mr. Fuchs had to answer many questions, but&#xD;
Charles thought he noticed a certain something, a reserve in his&#xD;
manner, that was not natural. Still he said nothing, intending to&#xD;
askanexplanation on the first chance he had. Mr. Fuchs had re-&#xD;
ported "all right" in response to questions concerniugounot-&#xD;
tage and factor and if anything else was wrong, it could not be&#xD;
very serious .On reaching the factory however, he thoug  e&#xD;
noticed an unusual stir about the building. A crowd was stand-&#xD;
ing in the yard and as they came abreast the yard, they saw the&#xD;
offestanding open and within it a plain coffin resting on two&#xD;
chairs. A foreboding seized his mind, and grasping his father's&#xD;
arm he said.&#xD;
"It isn't-his body?"&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs nodded.&#xD;
Yes Charlie it is his bod. It seems, providence made you in-&#xD;
YeCal in dawig the sinner to an early account. The revol-&#xD;
rtwhich you gave into the hand of old Josiah, sent off the fetal&#xD;
bullet."&#xD;
.' Understand these allusions. He became restive&#xD;
Mr. Fox did not ndrtn      eea        .&#xD;
and inquired with' evident curiosity.&#xD;
" W homnq uire u  t al e ad n t ?  Som ebody  w as  killed  w ith  a  pistol&#xD;

giving rise to idle speculationsMm&#xD;
"But the ~ nameSr h ae ! Mr. Fox exclaimed impatiently.&#xD;
"But the name, Sir, then  h   ubepatc        fhsery&#xD;

Now Mr. Fox understood.'d- He was evidently deeply =ovet&#xD;
and folding his hands exclaimed:&#xD;
"Wood! her cousin! is it possible?"&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       277&#xD;
"Does my wife know?"&#xD;
"No, Sir, we thought best not to tell her at so critical a period."&#xD;
Again a silence. After a while Mr. Fox resumed:&#xD;
"Please tell me the particulars. It will ease me, to know all&#xD;
about it."&#xD;
The others were equally anxious and listened with suspended.&#xD;
breath to Mr. Fuchs' recital.&#xD;
"I can only give you the story Josiah told me," he said. "The&#xD;
second night after Charlie's departure, the watchman saw some-&#xD;
body creeping about the office. It was near midnight and dark&#xD;
and on Josiah's summons the noise ceased. But the watchman&#xD;
had been cautioned by Charlie in regard to the office and the&#xD;
mere cessation of the noise did not satisfy him.  So he walked&#xD;
up to the spot, where he had noticed the suspicious movements.&#xD;
By the light of his lantern he was enabled to see the form of a&#xD;
human being cowering in the corner made by the office-walls and&#xD;
the fence. The man saw no chance of escape; except by running&#xD;
past the watchman. He rose and started but his face becoming&#xD;
visible Josiah disc vered that it was the superintendent's.&#xD;
"Mr. Wood!" he xclaimed.&#xD;
"That exclamation sealed the fate of the intruder. On hearing&#xD;
his name he stopped-at least Josiah says so-and cursing the&#xD;
person, who dared to interfere with his designs, sprang towards&#xD;
the watchman with a dagger in his hand. It seems to have arou-&#xD;
sed his anger, to see himself discovered; else it is hard to under-&#xD;
stand, why he should have stopped his flight. Perhaps he also&#xD;
wanted to satisfy an old grudge against the watchman, who seems&#xD;
to have been a thorn in his side, preventing him from moving&#xD;
freely in his nightly operations-at all events, if the statement of&#xD;
Josiah is correct, the superintendent ran towards him with mur-&#xD;
derous intentions and justified the use of the revolver, as an act&#xD;
of self-defence.. Josiah fired but one shot, the bullet penetrating&#xD;
the forehead and killing him on the spot."&#xD;
"And what-what do the people say about this?"&#xD;
Mr. Fox gasped on asking this question.&#xD;
"They generally share the opinion of the coroner's jury, which&#xD;
readily acquitted Josiah of all .blame and passed the verdict of&#xD;
death in consequence of unjustifiable assault upon a fellow-being.&#xD;
The knowledge of' the late conduct of the dead man may have&#xD;

influenced public opinion, or it may n t-it isn't my business to.&#xD;
sit in judgment over the jury."&#xD;
Here the subject was dropped and the balance of the way tra-&#xD;
versed in silence. ~ Mr. Fox had arrived in so contented a mood&#xD;
aud now this tragedy must occur and cast a gloom  over the as-&#xD;
pect of affairs. He felt sad indeed on arriving at the cottage;&#xD;
but the joyous cry from the lips of Dolores and the more quiet&#xD;
demonstrations of joy on the part of Lucy had the effect of cheer-&#xD;
ing him again. He "wandered from the arms of one into those of&#xD;
another and the welcome from Mrs. Fuchs was hardly less warm&#xD;
than that of the girls. She took him and Richard into the- par-&#xD;
lor and from her expectant look it was evident that she was anx-&#xD;
ious for him to broach a certain delicate matter. Mr. Fox under-&#xD;
stood it very well; but he had, to undergo a last violent struggle&#xD;
before he could force himself to ask the question:&#xD;
"And Mrs. Fox, how is she to-day?"&#xD;
A pleasant smile and grateful look on the part of Dolores re-&#xD;
warded him for his effort and Mrs. Fuchs also seemed to be grat-&#xD;
ified, for it was in her happiest tone that she thanked him for the&#xD;
inquiry and stated, that Mrs. Fox was not only a hundred-per-cent&#xD;
better than on the day of his departure ; but also extremely anx-&#xD;
ious to see him.&#xD;
"She knows then, of our arrival?"&#xD;
"She knows that you are here; but we thought best, to say no-&#xD;
thing as yet about Richard's presence. We thought too much&#xD;
emotion might imperil her recovery."&#xD;
"Well, you are right madam and thoughtful as ever. I shall&#xD;
manage to break the news tb her so as to avoid excitement - What&#xD;
room shall I find'her in? No, Dol, not you; Mrs. Fuchs will have&#xD;
the kindness, to point out the way. I'll soon be back children."&#xD;
They all understood, that he wanted no witnesses to his in-&#xD;
terview. Nor did Mrs. Fuchs presume to go any further than to&#xD;
the door. Stopping there and laying her hand upon his arm, she&#xD;
said in a low voice and with pleading earnestness:&#xD;
"Spare her, Mr. Fox! She is weak and penitent."&#xD;
He nodded.&#xD;
-'Fear nothing, madam. I shall endeavor to secure your appro-&#xD;
bation."&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs smiled and then stepped back. He on the other&#xD;

band. She tried to rise; but her weakness or emotion, or per&#xD;
haps a union of both caused a failure of the effort. She sank&#xD;
back into her seat and the hand, that had grasped the arm of the&#xD;
chaeto sustain the movement now held on to it, to hide the tre-&#xD;
mor which had seized it.&#xD;
Mr. Fox had seen the effort and its failure. He had also seen&#xD;
the ravages, which the recent sickness had committed on her face.&#xD;
Her cheeks had sunk away, her lips lost their color, and the dark&#xD;
hair contrasted strongly with the thin pale countenance. Her&#xD;
eyes looked larger than before and Mr. Fox thought he saw a&#xD;
meek resignation, an humble prayer for forgiveness in them, which&#xD;
touched him deeply. A minute before he had thought, that in.&#xD;
showing kindness and compassion lie would have to play a role;-&#xD;
but there was no acting in his motion, when stepping forward and&#xD;
raising his hand in admonition, he cried:&#xD;
"Don't Caroline! you are too weak to rise. How do you do&#xD;
to-day? I am glad to hear that you are rapidly recovering."&#xD;
In saying this he had approached her and extended his hand in&#xD;
greeting. But she shook her head and warding off his hand, she&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Edward, you are very kind; but I cannot consent, to abuse&#xD;
your kindness. Are you aware that---that you offer your handto&#xD;
one-to one, that broke ?the pledge of affection and fidelity she&#xD;
swore to you before the altar,?"&#xD;
At first Mrs. Fox had faltered considerably in making this con-&#xD;
fession; but towards the end her voice had become at once lower&#xD;
and firmer. Her head was bowed upon her hand and in breath-&#xD;
less suspense she waited for his answer. At last it came. He&#xD;
Was still standing and looking down with a mixture of grief and&#xD;
compassion he replied:&#xD;
"Caroline, I am aware of it."&#xD;
She shook her head with a mournful sadness.&#xD;
"You cannot know all, Edward, or  ou would not thus kind&#xD;
offer me your hand. I have sinned and have to bear    ly&#xD;
The                           breathe penalty.&#xD;
The blackness of my heart must be laid open to you, before I can&#xD;
appeal, to you, to decide m  etn.&#xD;

. "Caroline, that is a useless seiftorture. In torturing yourself,&#xD;
you also torture me. I assure you that you can tell me nothing&#xD;
new. I know your whole mistake and have forgiven it."&#xD;
"I thank you, Edward. I had no right to hope for this. But&#xD;
your forgiveness merely affects the past: you are also the arbiter&#xD;
of my future. Dispose of me according to yonr pleasure and I&#xD;
assure you, that I shall kiss the rod, that strikes me."&#xD;
Mr. Fox shook his head.&#xD;
"Caroline you little know my heart, if you deem me capable of&#xD;
playing the part of the stern judge, who must condemn the deed,&#xD;
even if he pai'dons the offense. No Caroline, our relation before&#xD;
the eyes of the world must continue as it was before. We owe it&#xD;
to ourselves, to our children, to these kind friends, who have ex-&#xD;
erted themselves day and night to guard our name from evil re-&#xD;
pute. As to my feelings, Caroline, I solemnly assure you, that I&#xD;
harbour nothing in my heart, that bears the character of anger or&#xD;
revenge. I have fully and from the bottom of my heart forgiven&#xD;
you-more you cannot ask at present. If I told you differently,&#xD;
you would not credit my assertions and a new obstacle would rise&#xD;
between us. Men cannot change their feelings in a day; butCar-&#xD;
oline, if what they say is true, if youm have really laid off the char-&#xD;
acter of former days and assumed that spirit of gentleness and&#xD;
meekness, which adorns a woman above every other grace-then&#xD;
Caroline I shall with gladness welcome you back to my arms and&#xD;
hear and bless the day, which turned a seeming curse into a bles-&#xD;
sing. Now let me ask you: will you on these conditions return&#xD;
to me and accept the hand, you did refuse before?"&#xD;
Copious tears streamed over her cheeks; but she made no effort&#xD;
to check them and taking his hand replied:&#xD;
"I thank you Edward.' You grant me infinitely more, than I&#xD;
had reason to expect. But you will see, that you have not be&#xD;
stowed your charity upon one undeserving. Henceforth your wel-&#xD;
fare shall be my constant prayer, your happiness my study. Oh!&#xD;
why was I condemned, to wander in my blindness all these years!&#xD;
why did I with my perversness check your salutory influence up-&#xD;
on our boy and thus become instrumental in urging him myself&#xD;
upon the road of vice!"&#xD;
She hid her face and her tears threatened to assume the char-&#xD;
acter of hysterical sobs. Mr. Fox thought, that under the cir-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       281&#xD;
cumstances a sudden announcement of her son's return might do&#xD;
no harm; but rather act as a strong restorative to mental health&#xD;
and vigor. So he said:&#xD;
"Dont cry Caroline. In this instance as in others a kind pro-&#xD;
vidence has averted the worst consequences of your errors.&#xD;
Richard is not lost to you, he lives, he has returned with me and&#xD;
longs for your permission to lay down into your hand the pro-&#xD;
mise of a better life."&#xD;
The medicine -was powerful, but in this instance it had been&#xD;
properly administered and served as a check for the sinking spirit&#xD;
and despondency of Mrs. Fox. On her husband's announcement,&#xD;
she raised her head; her sobs ceased as if by magic and extend-&#xD;
ing her hands, she cried:&#xD;
"Richard! my son, where are you? Oh Edward, if you have&#xD;
any compassion upon your erring but repenting wife, go bring&#xD;
hm here, the missing one; him, whom I had given up for doubly&#xD;
lost."&#xD;
Mr. Fox left the room and a minute afterwards his son entered&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
"Richard!"&#xD;
"Mother!"&#xD;
The two lay in one another's arms and their tears mingled in&#xD;
one copious stream. Mr. Fox had not returned; perhaps he&#xD;
thought, that such a scene would be profaned by even a father's&#xD;
presence. Reader, let us drop the curtain, to look in at them is&#xD;
not meet any more for us, than him. The relation of mother and&#xD;
child--though sullied by the dross of sinful passions-is always&#xD;
sacred. Let us respect it.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
PLANNING ALL AROUND.&#xD;
Calmer days were following this stormy season; cahn within,&#xD;
though rough and ungenial without. The family of Mr. Fox had&#xD;
soon after his arrival returned to the mansion and the indis-&#xD;
guised joy of Susan and the other servants had brought tears&#xD;
into the eyes of their mistress. For the first time in allher mar-&#xD;
ried life she seemed to comprehend the meaning of the word&#xD;
"home." Mr. Fox although prepared for a change, had hardly&#xD;

282                     DOLORES. -&#xD;
dared to hope, that it would be so radical; and when Mrs. Fox&#xD;
declared, that she was not well enough, to go to the city, but .de-&#xD;
lighted at the thought of spending the winter hi their snug com-&#xD;
fortable country home; when he saw her devotedness to ,Dolores&#xD;
and made unceasing efforts to make the girl forget her former&#xD;
hostile coldness; when she almost forced Mrs. Fuchs'to frequent&#xD;
intercourse and insisted upon the rights and privileges of rela-&#xD;
tionship-when all these strange changes developed themselves&#xD;
before his eyes; he felt that the moment of reinstating her into&#xD;
her former privileges, had already come and that, if he delayed&#xD;
a confession of that fact, he merely hesitated from a fear of see-&#xD;
ing these fine improvements all at once dissolve in vapor.&#xD;
But such a fear was without the least foundation. Mrs. Fox,&#xD;
was the first, to call her husband's attention to the fact, that Fox&#xD;
ville would hardly furnish t'he means of finishing such an educa-&#xD;
tion of the girls, as the times required of their station in life.&#xD;
"You do not like the City," she continued, "and I too have lost'-&#xD;
all taste for it - Would it not be proper then to select a good&#xD;
boarding school, where Lucy and Dolores could finish their edu-&#xD;
cation and acquire such accomplishments, as make home pleas-&#xD;
ant? They both have fine voices and Dolores a great taste for&#xD;
drawing and much as I hate the thought of losing their cheering&#xD;
influence at home, I think e are hardly justifiable in allowing&#xD;
motives of selfishness to, detain us from giving them every op-&#xD;
portunity to improve their talents."&#xD;
"I do not like boarding schools, Caroline," Mr. Fox replied,,&#xD;
"but if you really are in earnest regarding your resolution, of&#xD;
making Foxville your permanent home, I do not see how we can&#xD;
avoid them. The girls certainly need further opportunities and&#xD;
so I suppose we must choose the smallest of two evils. Do you&#xD;
know of any good school in the neighbourhood, where they might&#xD;
go? Mind I can notentertain the thought of sending them too&#xD;
far away."&#xD;
"Nor I either Edward. I really know of none that I could re-&#xD;
commend at present; but don't you think, that Mr. Goodman-&#xD;
could guide us in our selection? He is largely acquainted in the&#xD;
State and I have no doubt, that he could furnish the desired in-&#xD;
formation."&#xD;
"We can at least try him, but Caroline this suggestion of yours&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       283&#xD;
has called another matter to my mind, that needs attention  The&#xD;
question is: what profession is our Richard to chose for life? H&#xD;
has failed in mercantile pursuits; for a scholar he seems but poorly&#xD;
qualified: what course then had weinyuopinbetavs&#xD;
him toadopw? in your opinion best advise&#xD;
him to adopt?"&#xD;
"I hardly know Edward, and even if I had an idea, I should&#xD;
hardly venture to disclose it. My influence on tea I hs&#xD;
attended with such pernicious consequences, Edward, that I want&#xD;
you to decide yourself.'?&#xD;
Mir. Fox smiled.&#xD;
"That's what I call a very cunning way of shirking responsi-&#xD;
bilities; but you put the load upon my shoulders in such a grace-&#xD;
ful manner, that I cannot well object. I have indeed been think-&#xD;
ing of a calling that could not fail to exercise a healthy influence&#xD;
upon our boy; but I have been hesitating to broach it because&#xD;
feared your opposition."&#xD;
She shook her head with a melancholy smile&#xD;
"I see, my efforts have as yet been unsuccessful, to convince you&#xD;
of my earnest purposes; nor have I reason to complain: ah! it&#xD;
is hard to win back a husband's confidence, when once forfeited."&#xD;
"No Caroline, dear Caroline, do not say that, for it is not the&#xD;
case. Continue your present course and you will redeem even&#xD;
more than you promised."&#xD;
"Thank you Edward ; your words do make me happy. But you&#xD;
have failed to mention the profession, you think adapted to our&#xD;
Richard."&#xD;
"Well, Caroline, what do you think of the sea?"&#xD;
Mrs. Fox started, her cheeks blanched: she folded her hands&#xD;
on her. bosom and cast a supplicating glance at her husband,&#xD;
That was all the answer he received.&#xD;
"There !" he said, smiling. "I thought as much. A mother&#xD;
always thinks of the sea with a shudder, when it comes to trust-&#xD;
ing her son toithe mercy of the treacherous element."&#xD;
"No, Edward, indeed I do not object. My first emotionwas one&#xD;
of fear, it is true; but that once conquered I am far from disapin on&#xD;
proving your choice. I think myself, that the rii discplin onp&#xD;
board the ship would have a salutary effect upon  edickle  on&#xD;
acter of our boy. But will he not object?"&#xD;
-"If you agree.Caroline, I shall not listen to his objections. Hie&#xD;

owes us a reparation for his past offences and my proposal will&#xD;
give him a good opportunity of showing the earnestness and&#xD;
sincerity of his professions. There he comes, I may as well broach&#xD;
the subject to him at once. Richard we have been talking about&#xD;
you. We think it time for you to choose'a calling. What do you&#xD;
think of a mariner's profession?"&#xD;
"I think I should like it well enough. I have failed in a course&#xD;
of my own and resolved to be this time guided by your judgment.&#xD;
If you think a sailor's life calculated to improve me, I have no&#xD;
objection in adopting it."&#xD;
"That's spoken like a man, Richard. I do indeed consider a&#xD;
sailor's calling adapted to your nature. But in what branch&#xD;
would you like to serve? Shall I procure for you a cadetship at&#xD;
Annapolis, or would you rather devote yourself to mercantile pur-&#xD;
suits and after due apprenticeship enter the captaincy of a merch-&#xD;
ant vessel?"&#xD;
"I think the latter more desirable, father. A stay at Annapolis&#xD;
might be fraught with new temptations and shake my good reso-&#xD;
lutions. They have hardly rooted deep enough to stand much&#xD;
shaking. Moreover I do not think, that I'll ever be much of a&#xD;
scholar and so the merchant man will be the proper place for me."&#xD;
"There is sense in what you say 1ichard, and I shall do accord-&#xD;
ing to your wishes. There is a friend of mine, a captain Tarfield&#xD;
ready to put to sea in a new vessel, the "Swallow" and I think I&#xD;
can manage to secure a berth for you on board of it. Your moth-&#xD;
er can meanwhile superintend your outfit; for if we fail ingetting&#xD;
you on board the swallow, there will be hundred other chances. I&#xD;
shall write to Tarfield without delay."&#xD;
Thus measures were taken at the mansion to send the younger&#xD;
generation away from home, to prepare them for a later struggle&#xD;
with the world. Mr. Fox was very glad ththswfa      ae&#xD;
the lead in regard to the education of the girls. Since Dolores'&#xD;
accession to a rich inheritance, he had more than ever felt his res-&#xD;
ponsibility and the necessity of giving her a thorough education.&#xD;
Mr. Goodman had done his full duty ; but in modern languages,&#xD;
in music and the lighter arts, which at once adorn and enrich our&#xD;
life, he was unable to do anything for them. Mr. Fox did not as&#xD;
yet feel justified to divulge to his wife the new circumstances of&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       285&#xD;
their cousin and foster-daughter, therefore his satisfaction at her&#xD;
proposal.&#xD;
A similar process of fermentation took place at the cottage at&#xD;
the same time. Charles had always had a great taste for the arts&#xD;
and sciences and now, when fortune had smiled on his family and&#xD;
put sufficient means at his disposal, his former love for them not&#xD;
only revived, but became irresistable. He had not been bak a&#xD;
month, when he announced his desire to visit some institution of&#xD;
learning and under able instructors go through a regular course&#xD;
of study. Of course lie found no resistance. His parents were&#xD;
so accustomed to consider the wishes of the high-minded, intel-&#xD;
ligent youth as binding, that they would not even have dreamed&#xD;
of refusing their sanction to so commendable a resolution. But,&#xD;
while the course of Charles was clearly marked out and rather a&#xD;
source of pleasure than trouble, the future of the younger brother&#xD;
often filled the parents' heart with apprehension. He showed no&#xD;
predilection for either mental or manual labor and the drudgery&#xD;
of mercantile pursuits was extremely distasteful to this fastidi-&#xD;
ous youth. His parents were at a loss how to proceed with him,&#xD;
when the destination of Richard at once threw light on their per-&#xD;
plexity. The ocean! Yes the ocean! That is a wide berth for&#xD;
all, that cannot prosper on the land. If they cannot make their&#xD;
way amongst their fellow-beings, put them on the ocean-there&#xD;
they are out of the *ay. This sounds like irony, but what is irony&#xD;
except truth somewhat sharply drawn? The ocean is the great&#xD;
school for good-for-nothings, where no temptation entices them&#xD;
back to their ways of folly. This is at best. a negative preventa-&#xD;
tive but it is better than none at all and in battling with winds&#xD;
and waves many a youth has regained that healthy tone of mind&#xD;
'n   y, that moral sensitiveness, which grieving parents had&#xD;
already given up for lost.&#xD;
Yes, Henry must go to sea. He must, if possible become a&#xD;
shipmate of Richard. They will find a mutual consolation in&#xD;
their company, when on the first rough contact with'the elements&#xD;
their heart threatens to sink within them.&#xD;
A feeble monitor warns against this arangement, demonstrating&#xD;
that the boys will not only be a support to one another in the-&#xD;
hours of trouble but also a weight in the wrong scale inthe hour&#xD;
&#xD;

of temptation. They are not always s on the sea; th port is near-&#xD;
ing with all its low enjoyments and the voice of conscience which&#xD;
might have been listened to by each one singly may become&#xD;
drowned by the noisy encouragement they give to one another.&#xD;
This voice, so weak, so feeble, is lost sight of in so many con-&#xD;
siderations of greater moment.&#xD;
The boys like the arrangement, and when a letter from Mr.&#xD;
Tarfiekr announces his readiness to receive both of them in the&#xD;
capacity of ordinary members of his crew, the bitter pill of humi-&#xD;
liation is very much sweetened by the thought, that they.can&#xD;
weather the roughness of the trial in each other's company.&#xD;
Busy scenes are now the order of the day. Trunks are bought&#xD;
and packed, two of them with the infinite number of items con-&#xD;
stituting a lady's wardrobe; two others with the rough and strong&#xD;
materials used for a sailor's suit and the last one with the neat&#xD;
but plain garments adapted to a student's character.&#xD;
The scene of packing is followed by the more noisy one of&#xD;
shaking hands and giving kisses and shedding tears and indulg-&#xD;
ing in parting salutations in general. Then a sudden stillness&#xD;
. follows, falling heavily upon the bereaved parents. Foxville&#xD;
seems dead to them, the streets deserted. Their meals taste so&#xD;
insipid and, the coffee has lost its flavor. Only by degree they&#xD;
reconcile themselves to their solitary lot, and then lacking other&#xD;
points of attraction and entertainment are more closely drawn&#xD;
towards each other. How often do we notice a doting tenderness&#xD;
in old married people to one another, which dates frpm the time&#xD;
when the nestling made the first trial of its wings and perching&#xD;
on another tree began to push affairs on his or her own account.&#xD;
Besides missing his children in the house, Mr. Fox felt as if by&#xD;
losing Charles from the factory, he had lost his right hand. True&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs assisted him with all his strength and ability; but Mr.&#xD;
Fuchs wasn't Charles, and could not replace him. The matter&#xD;
would have been worse, if Charles had not in the queerest man-&#xD;
ner procured a substitute just a few days before leaving. One&#xD;
morning on calling at the postoffice, he had received a very odd&#xD;
epistle, which ran as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;

CHARLES BURLESQUE,&#xD;
Charles laughed. The letter amused him; but it als&#xD;
him. The best of us are prone to be pleased to see ots  eter-&#xD;
tain a good opinion of us, and Charles did not cl  e etter,&#xD;
than the best. He mused a little and then former toluton.&#xD;
He had'liked the frankness of the actor and was inclined to go&#xD;
on first impressions. He did not know the man at' all be felt&#xD;
assured that whatever his other failings might be h&#xD;
be deceitful. Everything else might be tolerated and  ded&#xD;
and Charles began to wonder, whether Mr. Burlesque would not&#xD;
answer to act in a measure as his substitute. The actor was of&#xD;
a cheerful disposition and might exercise a healthful influence on&#xD;
Mr. Fox. Taking it all together the, 'pro's" outweighed the&#xD;
"contra's" and Charles had no sooner come to this conclusion,&#xD;
than he went to Mr. Fox, to gain hi opinion and consent.. Mr.&#xD;
Fon waganot frea from the prejudice which many worthy men have&#xD;
coeivedigate cors and a dubious shaking of his head at the&#xD;
beginning of' the communication portended little good for our&#xD;

&#xD;
after finishing, had the satisfaction of seeing his fatherly friend&#xD;
embrace a different view..&#xD;
"The fellow by assisting us in finding the track of Richard,&#xD;
has put us under obligations" he said, "and what you tell me of&#xD;
his character. has rather pleased me. Therefore, if you have. set&#xD;
your heart on making the experiment, I may as well accord my&#xD;
sanction."&#xD;
So Charles sat down to answer the letter and on return of mail&#xD;
Mr. Burlesque received the summons to pack up his baggage and&#xD;
star t for Maine. "Leave the cravats that knew yon in the role of&#xD;
princes, behind in Boston and-if possible-even the recollections&#xD;
of those roles. You will find a very quiet corner and if you can-&#xD;
not spent a mouth without seeing a strange face, you better stay&#xD;
where you are."&#xD;
Mr. Burlesque thought he could and so he cai1e. He was&#xD;
kindly received by Charles and Mr. Fox and introduced into the&#xD;
families of the cottage and the mansion. After he had recovered&#xD;
from the fatigues of his trip he was at once imitated in the duties&#xD;
of his new office and seemed to like it well enough. Only one&#xD;
thing created his dissatisfaction, namely the early departure of&#xD;
his new friend.&#xD;
.tit is too bad !" he said. "After hunting and finding at last a&#xD;
real friend, I must experience the grief, of parting from hun.&#xD;
That minds me of the dying king, whose life could only be saved&#xD;
by his wearing the shirt of a man of perfect happiness; the mes-&#xD;
sengers, after scouring the whole kingdom, finally found but one&#xD;
happy man and he possessed no shirt. The king died and so my&#xD;
friend, will my contentment die, ou your departure."&#xD;
Charles consoled him as best he could, promising numerous let-&#xD;
ters and when the day of parting came, he left Mr. Burlesque n&#xD;
a comfortable state of mind. Charles went by way of Boston,&#xD;
and on his arrival at that city disposed of the balance of his dia-&#xD;
monds to Messrs. Ruby and Brillant and of his doubloons to&#xD;
other parties.&#xD;
The money thus realized he invested in equal shares for te&#xD;
benefit of his father and Dolores with the assistance o a rl&#xD;
able broker, to whom Mr. Fox had given him a letter of in-&#xD;
troduction. A dozen of the finest jeel &amp;amp; however he retained for&#xD;
Dolores leaving them with Messrs. Ruby &amp;amp; Co. with directiofls&#xD;

in this new sphere of mine. On the whole I like it, as it promises&#xD;
food for my mind. True Mr. Goodman did not let me starve at&#xD;
home ; but his dishes sometimes were just a shade too heavy for&#xD;
me, creating as it were a mental dyspepsia. It takes a good&#xD;
stomach to digest his Greek and Latin and trigonometry and cal-&#xD;
culus and I am glad to interperse my meals with lighter dishes. I&#xD;
am studying French now, and by studying I mean studying.&#xD;
Charles is going to learn the same language and we have agreed&#xD;
upon a race. I should lie so much to beat him but I fear I can-&#xD;
not do it. He has a powerful mind, I see that more distinctly&#xD;
every day, because I have now the means 'of comparison. I am&#xD;
sorry to say it- but it is true, nevertheless-there is much little-&#xD;
ness around me, littleness of mind and ltttleness of soul. I cn-"&#xD;
notray, that Iglike-.these:girls very much, and I- fear, that I shall&#xD;
not form many friendships either. I read so much about school-&#xD;
mate's intimacies and ardent friendships dating from school and&#xD;
continuing through life; but I have thus far, seen very little of&#xD;
the kind. Perhaps it is my own fault; perhaps I lack the neces-&#xD;
sary sympathy and cannot become enthusiastic for the subjects&#xD;
which interest the others. They are fond of dress and jewels-&#xD;
I do not care about either: they fall in love with every mustache&#xD;
and I find nothing interesting either in the mustaches or their&#xD;
owners. They move in superlatives and exhausting their vocabu-&#xD;
lary on commonplace affairs, are lacking language to enter' into&#xD;
topics of a higher nature. I do not understand them, or rather&#xD;
they pretend, that I am a closed book to them. I think they do&#xD;
dislike me and a would-be-friend and gossip informed me of the&#xD;
reason. I want to be better and wiser, they allege, according to&#xD;
the say so of this friend and such an unpardonable presumption&#xD;
connot be tolerated. Alas! God knows, that I have no such feel-&#xD;
ings. I'll try to be a little more sociable and enter into-the spirit&#xD;
of their conversation, although it will be uphill work, I know.&#xD;
In fact I have been spoiled at home. The intercourse with Charles&#xD;
and Mr. Goodman and Sarah--yes Miss Sarah too and all the&#xD;
other friends-I mean the intercourse with them has spoiled&#xD;
me They are real men and women and here I feel as if they were&#xD;
ti  all of them and blaming me for giving myself as nature&#xD;
mae me. Well, it is unfortunate, that I can take refuge to other&#xD;
friends.. My books can comfort me and so can the grand view of&#xD;

....I am amused at my French professor and cannot hel lgh&#xD;
ng at his odd language and movements. He is the very  '&#xD;
of a Frenchman, at least as I imagine from the numerous descrip-&#xD;
tions I have read. Monsieur Parbleu is a man of small stature;&#xD;
his dress, his gait, his bow, his "tournure"--as he calls it are pr-&#xD;
fect and he always appears to me as if on coming to school h&#xD;
ad stepped from an etui, a case as it were and on  i&#xD;
could do nothing else but return toit.--I show great defee to&#xD;
the man, because I feel it and-either from this reason or because&#xD;
I study my lessons he seems to have formed a similar regard for&#xD;
me. According to his assertions, I must surely be th  eight&#xD;
wonder of the world. Monsieur Parbleu has-never in hi  x&#xD;
peeriaince found such ain aibell scholaire as Miss Doloraise upon-&#xD;
honnaire, he nevaire fiattairs. -I take good care not to tell him&#xD;
the reason of my efforts; it does a person good to be consid&#xD;
something; because it urges them, to be something  M&#xD;
teachers are also pleased .&amp;amp;ith my progress; at least th  s oe&#xD;

My .instructor in Music is a German, a good man too I am em&#xD;
lined to believe; but the very Opposite to Monsieur Parbl&#xD;
lie isn't at all tidy in his dress,-all geniuses are slovenly the&#xD;
say and Herr Spreitzfinger is on all sides allowed to be a member&#xD;
o that chosen band. He smokes a detestable ciga     -   er&#xD;

clothes, becomes the tell tale of his besetting weakness.&#xD;
wears a loose cravat and turned collars which are more resark-&#xD;
able for size than cleanness. His long black hair hangs erk-&#xD;
sheveled masses round his head, forming, as I hear, anoth  trik-&#xD;

In short, my music-teacher is anything but a counterpart to the&#xD;
fashionable Monsieur Parbleu and the girls always titter, when&#xD;
he makes his appearance. I however am inclined to forgive is&#xD;
shortcomings for the sake of the'pleasure I derive from his per-&#xD;
formance on the piano. In fact, when he plays, I'don't see either&#xD;
collar or coatsleeves; my sight becomes a secondary matter and&#xD;
the ear steps into the first place. I know but little about music,&#xD;
but I cannot help thinking, that the professor really is something&#xD;
of a genius. The other girls don't like his music; they always&#xD;
league him about polkas and schottisches and the like and Mr.&#xD;
Spreitz finger don't like it. The other day I was present when&#xD;
he replied to such a request:&#xD;
"Ladies, you petter puy a krind-organ, tat plays tances better&#xD;
tan I can to it."&#xD;
The "Ladies" highly resented the idea, but I felt gratified and&#xD;
ever since I have vouchsafed the professor an increased amount&#xD;
of respect. A real artist ought to elevate the public to his stan-&#xD;
ard, not lower himself to theirs. He plays fantasies of the clas-&#xD;
sic school for me; sometimes also variations of his own and I de-&#xD;
rive a vague kind of pleasure from hearing them. I do not un-&#xD;
derstand that music yet, why should I deny it? but I hope I soon&#xD;
shall-The pleasure, it gives me now, is about the same as if I&#xD;
heard an orator in a language, of which I merely knew the rudi-&#xD;
ments. I know the text, but cannot follow the development of&#xD;
the arguments. Yet I hear the speaker's sonorous voice, I see&#xD;
the graceful sweep of his accompanying gestures; I look into his&#xD;
soul-lit features and have a mysterious anticipation of the sublim-&#xD;
ity of the thoughts he is pronouncing.&#xD;
Mr. Spreitzfinger begins to notice me. I am now through the&#xD;
drudgery of the A. B. C. of music and he sometimes looks at me,&#xD;
as if he wanted to look to the bottom of my soul and see, what&#xD;
is within me. This morning after my lesson, he threw back his&#xD;
long hair with a jerk; then wringing his bony fingers to make&#xD;
them crack in a dozen places, he said:.ei&#xD;
"Miss Tolores, you to remarkably vell. You have te material&#xD;
for a real artist. If you go on as on have commencet, I shall&#xD;
make someting out of you."&#xD;
"Are you in earnest, Sir?" I inquired. "I despise flattery."&#xD;
"You to?" he asked, casting a queer look at me; "te other ladies&#xD;

"Then Sir, I shah double my efforts. I dislike nothing more&#xD;
than indifferent  jumping on the instrument. Rather than be&#xD;
an indifferent player, I would be none at all."&#xD;
Then the professor made a queer remark.&#xD;
"Ko on, matam, at all events." he said-; "you have a soul t&#xD;
others haven't; what can tey expect to learn without a soul?'&#xD;
His tone was extremely sarcastic; but to me he sha&#xD;
ference than ever. This afternoon I met him in the a  and&#xD;
s hat and greeted me with a respect, as if I had been a&#xD;
prin ess.sSome of the girls saw it and teased me about it. e&#xD;

Mr. Strictly is a mere cipher in the establishment. He is a tall&#xD;
portly and rather handsome man but yet he is nothing but a ci-&#xD;
pher. He represents the outside dignity of the school, like the&#xD;
gaudy sign above a drygoods store or the carriages behind the&#xD;
hearse. Besides this he keeps the books and buys the victuals&#xD;
and on examinations and exhibitions, builds the stage and shifts&#xD;
the scenes and pulls the wires and prompts the performers. I&#xD;
must laugh, when I thinkoof him.' Not that I didn't like him-I&#xD;
do like him well enough, just as you like a second fiddle, that.&#xD;
adds the charm of harmony to the beauties of the air. Mrs.&#xD;
Strictly sings the airs, or-if ydu prefer it--she putt them on.&#xD;
The worthy pair reminds me of a droll story, that Charles told&#xD;
me oce.A friend of his examining the City of Liverpool, no-&#xD;
ticed a cobbler and his wife, who had established their shop on&#xD;
the sidewalk of the street and assisted one another in their work,&#xD;
Ae by mending she by recommending. Every once in a while the&#xD;
worthy pair would rise and, parting, take separate sides of the&#xD;
street. Then strutting down street with a dignified composure&#xD;
they would proclaim this dialogue.&#xD;
She. "My husband mends boots and shoes!"&#xD;
He (in deep basso) I am the man to do it.&#xD;
She. My husband etc. etc. ad infini'um.&#xD;
In our seminary the case lies just reversed. She mends the ig-&#xD;
norance and tattered manners of the pupils and he proclaims the&#xD;
fact to all the world and adjacent counties. Oh dear me! if she&#xD;
knew in what disrespectful terms I speak-about her to my diary.&#xD;
But then a person must have one confidential friend. The other&#xD;
girls gossip amongst themselves--I gossip to my diary.........&#xD;
A letter from Charlie! That is always a feast, a holiday.&#xD;
He writes in German, for fear he says, that I will forget that lan-&#xD;
guage over my French, unless he keeps me in practice. I forget&#xD;
German? Oh indeed! there is little danger of that. I like French&#xD;
well enough in its way; you can express yourself se politely, sa&#xD;
 it is the language for bon mots and sparkling wit-&#xD;
but with German it can stand no comparison. To it it is what&#xD;
the graceful birch is .to the, towering majestic oak. It waves&#xD;

shelter in its branches and the weary wanderer in its shade. Just&#xD;
as deeply as the oak sends its roots into the ground, the German&#xD;
languagersinks within our hearts, embracing it, creeping through&#xD;
it and pervading it in such a way, as to make any effort, to bear&#xD;
it out, extremely idle. No Charles, I shall not forget my German&#xD;
S    l a         forget you. Your letters do me good. We&#xD;

nor allows me to love her. Indeed I have ceased all efforts in that&#xD;
direction; for love is a mutual relation, is like the working of two&#xD;
opposite poles in magnetism. Lucy used to be the negative and&#xD;
I the positive and we agreed admirably. Now she hfs turned&#xD;
positive and I cannot change. Perhaps by growing negative, by&#xD;
playing  e role of the ivy climbing up the stronger tree, I might&#xD;

an involuntary outburst of delight in listening toone of Beet-&#xD;

clamation: "Oh! mein Gott, wie schoen!" escaped me. No sooner&#xD;

myself for doing it, but somehow it went so natural and Mr.&#xD;
Spreitzfinger appeared so much more to his advantage in his na-&#xD;
tiye tongue, which he speaks with a good accent, that one word&#xD;
aye the other, and the story was out before I knew it. The pro-&#xD;
fessor however made returns for my confidence, giving me some&#xD;
rough sketches of his life. Poor man! the uncouth gestures of&#xD;
his body,. and his slovenly habits have prevented him from mak-&#xD;
ing a mark in life. He don't know it himself; but it is neverthe&#xD;
less true. I see it from his sketches. His.talents were overlooked&#xD;
and his shortcomings noticed. Oh ye artists! take warning from&#xD;
poor Mr. Spreitzfinger and take to clean collars and coatsleeves&#xD;
which protect your elbows. My teacher is an artist; I know&#xD;
enough of music, to see that now-but his collars and imperfect&#xD;
coatsleeves have driven him from concert-halls into the semin-&#xD;
ary of a little country: town. Even here they injure him for I&#xD;
have caught several glances of Mrs Strictly, which forbode him&#xD;
little good. If he wasn't so successful a teacher, he would have&#xD;
been dismissed long before this. But he makes very small pre-&#xD;
tensions-that is another reason for our principal to retain him.-&#xD;
Mr. Spreitzfinger says, I begin to play tolerably well. . He&#xD;
praises my touch mnd expression. No wonder however!     He&#xD;
-makes me practice three hours a day and if that is not calculated&#xD;
to advance one's skill, I do not know what will. He thinks dif-&#xD;
f&amp;amp;rently. He says he knew people who praticed four hours and&#xD;
could never succeed in playing the plainest air. Yesterday he&#xD;
said in German:&#xD;
"Miss Dolores, you have such a silvery laugh, you must surely&#xD;
have a good voice: will you have the kindness to sing the scale&#xD;
for me?.'&#xD;
I saw no reason to refuse him and commenced with c, he sec-&#xD;
onding my voice with the corresponding chords. I wasn't des-&#xD;
thed however to reach the octave, for even before we were half&#xD;
through, he jumped from his stool with a vehemence that fright-&#xD;
ened me and walking through the room with his biggest .strides,&#xD;
exclaimed:&#xD;
"This voice! oh what a voice! and L did know nothing. about&#xD;
it! Six months, six precious months gone and lost! It is  . sin,&#xD;
a perfect shame. What, if I hadn't by chance tumbled over this&#xD;
precious voice! It might have remained untrained, lost to her-&#xD;
&#xD;
self and the world forever! But thank Gdd, it is time yet. Miss&#xD;
Dolores, I dont ask you, to take singing lessons: you must, you&#xD;
.absolutely must.',".odyou&#xD;
S    excitement was so ludicrous, that I could not help laughing,&#xD;
You may laugh as muclh as you please," he said, waving his&#xD;
hand, and speaking german, which language has now become t&#xD;
exclusive medium between us. "You may laugh. on condition&#xD;
that you let me have my way. The man, who found the Koh ior&#xD;
and he that ground it to its present brilliancy, can not be prouder&#xD;
Qf their success than I shall be, when this nig a&#xD;
first charms the ears of thousands."                 aine&#xD;
What could I do in the face of such enthusiasm?' I had to&#xD;
yield and now I practice singing as well as playino-&#xD;
....To-day I received a costly present. It seems thatCarl&#xD;
retaied some diamonds of uncle Eberhardt's and caused the&#xD;
to be set in Boston in a very tasty manner. Now they are lim&#xD;
in my hand and I hardly know, what I value more the gift or&#xD;
id letter that accompanies it. "Dol" he writes---ideed I fear&#xD;
the world is spoiling him, for he begins to latter-"Dol I beg&#xD;
you to accept.from me these jewels. They are a fitting  embl&#xD;
Of :your purity. The gold in which they are set, does no inreem&#xD;
their value; but it is necessary, to show them to advantage ase&#xD;

nd when she is done,, she will boast of her work and forget that&#xD;
only the setting is hers and nothing else and that the beaut and&#xD;
the sparkling, fire of the precious jewel were there before she&#xD;

leThats the way he writes and I am going to give him a good&#xD;
turg about in my reply.- .g&#xD;
But what shall I do with these stones? I cannot wear them&#xD;
here--they are too costly. I should raise such a mountain of&#xD;

or more highly favored than Lucy. It is enough to think, that&#xD;
she treats me with so much coldness-I shall do nothing on my&#xD;
part to widen the cleft between us.&#xD;
Vacation is over and we are back in our school, ready to&#xD;
plunge once more into the sea of learning. Strange! I was more&#xD;
loath to leave my, dear home this time than the first time On the&#xD;
first occasion I didn't know any better. The charm of novelty&#xD;
helped me over the pain of parting. Ba' now I do know. Only&#xD;
"n4au I fully understand the powerful charm and the melancholy&#xD;
sweetness of the old song: home,'sweet home! It isn't the air&#xD;
that captivates 'me,-though its gentle sadness is calculated to&#xD;
bring home the sentiments of the words with double force. I do&#xD;
not know,--why this air always pursues me waking and dreaming.&#xD;
I cannot account for it on the great appreciation .of my' home&#xD;
alone : a secret inward power drives'it to my lips a voice from the&#xD;
spirit-land, an echo from the past. Where does it come from, why&#xD;
does it strike me so powerfully?.....&#xD;
.There is one more reason, why I hated to leave Foxville&#xD;
worse than the first time. Charles was to be home too on vasa-&#xD;
tion; but unfortunately our terms did not coincide and all we could&#xD;
exact from him, was a promise, to do his best to meet us. I sup-.&#xD;
pose he did his best; but we did not see him. We lingered day&#xD;
after day, until Lucy refused to prolong our stay. Our school&#xD;
would open she said and she would not like to lose any recitations.&#xD;
Her parents praised her resolution and I?-of course I couldn't be-&#xD;
- tray my rehuctance and its cause. Lucy knew it; that I instinc-&#xD;
tively perceived. But no it was the love of study, her sense of&#xD;
order and of duty, which gave birth to her desire for a return to&#xD;
school.' I have really to conquer a disposition of feeling a bitter-&#xD;
ness against the girl. She begins to make the same impression&#xD;
upon me, with her even coldness; as a frog or other amphibiouni&#xD;
would in consequence of their cold slippery skin. If -I am wrong,&#xD;
if I wrong her-I cannot help it. I do my best, to force myself&#xD;
- to friendly feelings towards my parent's daughter, but I-must now&#xD;
repeat, what I said once before: Love cannot be forced and like&#xD;
the plant in subterranean vaults creeps to the warm and genial&#xD;
light..&#xD;

likei?"What do you think of Mr. Burlesque? and how do you&#xD;
like him?' was a question in a letter from Charlie, that lies before&#xD;
me. What I think of him? Well, he is a clever fellow with a&#xD;
gay disposition, rather too gay for me though. I like originality&#xD;
t Io not like farces. Over-drawn  characters become carica-&#xD;
tures and those I could never admire. Moreover Mr. Burlesque&#xD;
has driven his vehicle of life through "thick and thin" as they&#xD;
say in German and in consequence the mire has pattered all over&#xD;
him. I feel he is not so pure, as I should like a friend to be. To&#xD;
me he has never over stepped the bounds of decorum but I thought&#xD;
he Came as close to the margin as was possible. May be the sin-&#xD;
pl ife in Foxyille will improve him; indeed I hope it will, for&#xD;
ough my judgment can not exactly bestow the character of per-&#xD;
fectkon the man, my sympathy is with him. I like him well enough&#xD;
I like his constant efforts to cheer and help my dear papa; I like&#xD;
his struggle to forget the gay pleasures of his city life and learn&#xD;
proper appreciation of the charms of the country.  Bit&#xD;
most of all I like :the enthusiastic love, with which' he speaks of&#xD;
Ckarhe. He never tired of that topic and somehow I never tired&#xD;
listen to him and so it happened that we had many and long-&#xD;
chats together. He says, that Charlie is the only man he ever saw&#xD;
and I subscribe to it. Dear me! when I compare him with the-&#xD;
striplings on whom our girls here dote and about whom they rave,&#xD;
the difference appears so great, that I lack a measure to define it.&#xD;
Mr. Burlesque saw him but once and that sufficed to bind him&#xD;
heart and soul;.now if he loves him so much from one short in-&#xD;
terview, what can those do, that shared his leisure and his work.&#xD;
his joys, his sorrows and his aspirations. Yesterday I took Web-&#xD;

To day, when I came to my room, I thought Lucy looked&#xD;
rather nervous, contrary to her habits. She soon invented a pre-&#xD;
tence to leave me and when I took out my diary, I thought I no-&#xD;
ticed a confusion in the writing desk, that is not, usual. Should&#xD;
she have had the. meanness to pry into those papers? The box&#xD;
was locked, but these common locks are easily forced. It would&#xD;
be too bad indeed! But no, I shall not think it! I  all not&#xD;
condemn her on such slight suspicion. .But I shall be m  cau-&#xD;
tious and put the diary at a place hereafter, where prying eyes&#xD;
and skillful fingers will try in vain, to penetrate to it......-&#xD;
. Two years are gone and after the expiration of another I&#xD;
shall be through with my course of study. It makes me glad and&#xD;
sorry at the same time, to think of it. Sorry because the calm&#xD;
happy days of school life will then be over, never to return; happy,&#xD;
because then I shall be able to enjoy the company of my friends&#xD;
at home, without the fear of early parting. What does a short&#xD;
vacation amount to? Every day is spoiled and embittered by the&#xD;
thought, that the one is drawing near, which will surely snatched&#xD;
us from our home. Charles expects to be through aout th&#xD;
same time and if I am to trust his litters, he is about as anxious&#xD;
and impatient to meet me, as I him. Is it not strange, that two&#xD;
full years have passed, without bringing us face to face? Daring&#xD;
my two vacations he could not leave the college and when his va-&#xD;
cation came around and he made a trip up this way, to take me&#xD;
by surprise, I was absent on an excursion to the mountains with&#xD;
a pleasure-party from our seminary. We were absent a whole&#xD;
week and I did enjoy myself well enough, but when I got home&#xD;
and found his note and nothing but his note, in which he told me&#xD;
his sorrow on account of missing me, I felt as if I could despair&#xD;
and sat down to a good crying spell, such as I have not had for&#xD;
years. Now I shall have to wait another year, before I can ex-&#xD;
pect to see him. Dear me! how many things we shall then have&#xD;
to say to one another! How many stores we shall have to tell;&#xD;
how many questions to ask and to reply to; how many puzzles&#xD;
and problems of life and death to propose and solve ; how many&#xD;
imaginary trips to subterranean caves and deepest bowels of the&#xD;
earth; to make to mountain pcaks and to the airy realms above,;&#xD;

night shrink to a minihum and the days expand to their double&#xD;

the hours spent in his company will share the common fate of&#xD;
happy hours-their transientness.......&#xD;
....My diary is much neglected now. The session draws to-&#xD;
wards its close and I mean to compete for the first honor. Know&#xD;
Charlie does and it gives me a: sweet satisfaction to share his&#xD;
risk; but it will give me sweeter yet, te share his triumph.  My&#xD;
triumph however will not be very great. Three years are a long&#xD;
race, and most of our students are out of breath by this time.&#xD;
There are a few only of more tenacious purpose, than the crowd,&#xD;
who seem inclined to dispute my victory. Besides there are some&#xD;
new students, clever girls, who scorn to yield the palm with&#xD;
an effort. So the contest is not without a certain interest and&#xD;
though Iam far from feeling the feverish excitement of the first&#xD;
year, yet I feel the necessity of close application to make-success&#xD;
secure. Farewell then thou friend of my lonely hours, only at&#xD;
rare intervals will I, my diary! be enabled to visit thee. Farewell!&#xD;
-.-..A letter from Charlie! Such extraordinary events form an&#xD;
exception from the general rule. I must spare the time to chron-&#xD;
icle it in the pages of my diary; especially since it is very likely&#xD;
the last letter I'll get from him. One more week and 11l have&#xD;
ceased to be the happy schoolgirl to enter into a state not less&#xD;
laborious and even more responsible. One more week to prepare&#xD;
for the contest! I ought to concentrate my thoughts upon my&#xD;
studies, bnt I cannot do it. However much I struggle toretain&#xD;
them here they constantly fly to my native home, and to'the dear&#xD;
dear faces, I shall there meet again. There is a picture of Char-&#xD;
lie inthe letter, a splendid photograph. He wears a moustache&#xD;
now and handsome whiskers and I was so much engaged with&#xD;
looking at the picture, that I didn't notice how one of the girs&#xD;
came up behind and gazing over my shoulders, saw the picture.&#xD;
I started like a thief detected in the act of stealing when she&#xD;
clapped her hands and with a merry laugh exclaimed:&#xD;
"A man! a man! Our Lady Perfect has the picture of a man!&#xD;
He is handsome tho' and I'll keep mum, if you will on the spot&#xD;

I felt a burning in my face-of indignation I think it was, at&#xD;
her indiscretion. Without deigning to answer a word to her ques-&#xD;
tion, I turned abruptly and soht my chamber. There however&#xD;
her question haunts me all th time: Do I love him? No I love&#xD;
him not. If Webster is Correct I worship him and worship is no&#xD;
love. Worship you can but idols. I worship the idol of my&#xD;

Triumph! triumph! the palm is mine! The victory is won&#xD;
It as not edeily won however and I value the prize just in pro-&#xD;

too conquered-all the rest.  It was my thought of him, that gave&#xD;
me strength and can I doubt that he too thought of me? Doubt?&#xD;
fearfulword, which now for the first time rises in my mind. Doubt !&#xD;
If he had not learned to think of me, as I of him-what would&#xD;
the future be? A blank, for I love him, love him dearly, worship&#xD;
him   Why should I hide it from -myself? Alas I couldn't; for&#xD;
this feeling has become so interwoven with my nature, that to ig-&#xD;
nore it would be, not to exist. They write so much of love sleep-&#xD;
ing in our hearts and bursting into consciousness with a sudden&#xD;
start-well, perhaps they are right. I never knew how much I&#xD;
loved him until on my return from the mountain trip I learned&#xD;
that he had been here to see me. In the copious tears tien flowing&#xD;
rom my eyes love took root and grew until it filled my heart and&#xD;
 all the world. After that beauty received its merits but from&#xD;
racing him.. Intelligence from shining through his eyes. Vir-&#xD;
tue became of value since he cherished its pursuit and vice was&#xD;
shunned because he shunned it.......&#xD;
--Doubt! horrid word. How could I ever bear to live without&#xD;
a kindred feeling in his bosom?&#xD;
.A change has come over me. I now understand superla-&#xD;

home! I am the happiest creature on the globe. Time creeps&#xD;

CHAPTER XXYI.&#xD;
HOME AGAiN.&#xD;
Those were stirring, excited times in the two families of Fox-&#xD;
vile, when the girls came home. Theirs was not the only arrival&#xD;
for on the preceding day Richard and Henry had suddenly re-&#xD;
turned from Portsmouth, were their vessel was to undergo&#xD;
thorough repairs. They had leave of absence for the whole&#xD;
winter and were received with a welcome doubly hearty, as they&#xD;
bore letters from Captain Tarfield which gave them a pretty good&#xD;
character. True, neither of them had as yet advanced much in&#xD;
their profession as they had not succeeded in rising above the&#xD;
rank of common sailors; but that was only of secondary import-&#xD;
ance. If their new life had only improved their morals and made&#xD;
them more firmer in principle, the balance could easily be borne.&#xD;
A few more voyages would surely perfect them in the art of navi&#xD;
gation and once fit to command a vessel, the means of Mr- Fox&#xD;
would without much trouble secure Richard a captaincy with&#xD;
Henry for his lieutenant.&#xD;
Charles was now the only one wanting to make, the family circle&#xD;
complete. His session closed a little later and they could hardl&#xD;
expect him before another week. But though this circumstance&#xD;
somewhat damped the spirits of Dolores, the young men were&#xD;
gay and lively, and made the mansion and' the cottage ring with&#xD;
eir laughter and their stories. They had been in most of the&#xD;
countries of Europe and of course could relate many things that&#xD;
weretether new to the others or nevertheless listened to with in-&#xD;
terest because coming from the lips of eyewitnesses.&#xD;
Lucy was the one least excited. She greeted her brother as if&#xD;
he had been absent three weeks instead of three years. Richard&#xD;
of course could not help noticing this; but he either cared little&#xD;
about his sister's feelings toward him or was well skilled in hiding&#xD;
his own. He treated her as lightly, as she him and Dolores b&#xD;
came so much the object of his attention, that the whole family&#xD;
could not well help noticing it. Dolores alone in her innocence&#xD;
-failedto see anything unusual in his conduct and therefore lent&#xD;
him her ear with the good-nature, which formed a fundamental&#xD;
trait of her character. Oncewhen her eye suddenly, though un.&#xD;
intention y turned to the place, where Lucy sat,she thought she&#xD;
noticed a lurking expression in her look, which startled her. Her&#xD;

eye passed on however and when a minute afterwards it met that&#xD;
of Lucy a second time, nothing but tie old, tranquil indifference&#xD;
was visible.&#xD;
"I must have been mistaken" Dolores said to herself "though I&#xD;
shouldn't wonder if the attention which this loquacious sailorboy&#xD;
pays to my humble person, should increase her hostility. It is&#xD;
my misfortune to suffer worst for what I value least. Heaven&#xD;
knows, that I would gladly be spared the trouble, to listen to his&#xD;
suada, for-let the others think what they please-t am not at&#xD;
all inclined, to believe in there form'of these young rascal heroes.&#xD;
There is something in Richard's eye, which says: beware! I wish&#xD;
Charles would only come."&#xD;
A sigh, which ended this soliloquy, induced Richard to press&#xD;
her with thequestion, whether she felt unwell. A slight headache,&#xD;
the consequence of her trip in the stagecoach, gave her a good&#xD;
pretence, to withdraw to her room, where she threw berself upon&#xD;
her bed and soon was lost in a crowd of promiscuous thoughts.&#xD;
Richard was alone with Lucy now, for Henry had gone home&#xD;
immediately after Dolores' departure from the parlor. He made&#xD;
a motion like one that throws off a mask and said to his sister:&#xD;
"Lucy, I am glad, we can have a tete-a-tete. You have studied&#xD;
French, they tell me and you know what that means?"&#xD;
"Supposing, I do Richard : what good will a tete-a-tete do you?&#xD;
You surely have no secrets to communicate?"&#xD;
"No Lucy, that is the fact. If I had, I might choose a differ-&#xD;
ent person, to confide in."&#xD;
"You are -very flattering, Richard, I must confess. If the be-&#xD;
ginning of your tete-a-tete consists of taunts, what will the end&#xD;
be?"&#xD;
Richard looked at his sister attentively.&#xD;
"Lucy" he said after a few moments, "it strikes me, that you&#xD;
have changed most wonderfully, since I left you. Then you were&#xD;
the embodiment of gentleness, kindness and consideration: now&#xD;
you look sour enough to turn into No. 1 vinegar."&#xD;
"May be I feel like what I look.. Many things have changed&#xD;
here besides me Richard."&#xD;
"So it seem, Lucy. Amongst other important items I notice the&#xD;
reception of Dolores into universal favor."&#xD;
Lucy smiled scornfully.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"It does not take much penetration, to notice that"  -&#xD;
No, nor that you'form an exception from the rule. haid-&#xD;
use of it? Does Miss Lucyex&#xD;
touches of jealousy and envy?"&#xD;
Lucy's face remained unmoved.&#xD;
"If you have no secrets to reveal, I may. In such a case how-&#xD;
ever you will hardly wonder at my discretion."&#xD;
Richard laughed.&#xD;
"Lucy" he said, I do not recognize in you th  li&#xD;
yore. But you have changed for the better; have improved..  o&#xD;
show spunk and wit and cunning, all of which are imlroved qYou&#xD;
ties. I must say my respect for you has considerably inqal&#xD;
since our tets-a-tete.. I do despise nothing worse th  ireat&#xD;
come under the head of geese."&#xD;
"I am to consider that as a compliment?"&#xD;
.Deoidedly. Since this discovery of yqur talents I shall treat&#xD;
you very differently, from what I first intended. Instead treat&#xD;
ing you as a dumnb and witless puppet-..J now mean to g ofus-&#xD;
the clue=to the role you are to play.".iy&#xD;
"Are to play? Richard, methinks you use expression a little&#xD;
bit too positive."&#xD;
"Do I? beg pardon then, Lucy. Of course I expect&#xD;
on my behalf on your own free will, it being my business to c&#xD;
ince you, that it lies within your own interest to do  so."&#xD;
"Tsat sounds more reasonable. Let me hear, what you have&#xD;
to say.&#xD;
"First Lucy, allow me to insinuate, that you act very foolish&#xD;
in giving way to any enmity to Dolores."y&#xD;
ut why? Simply because you follow in the wake of th&#xD;
ave seen very well, that you attached yourself to her inets.&#xD;
I don't deny it; but Lucy, you must in justice confests.&#xD;
you are as much to blame as she. While           ess,that&#xD;
you turned a cold shoulder to my warm advance '  e kmdly&#xD;
«It ma be;          y wrmadvances."&#xD;
It may be; but I cannot-help it. It would make&#xD;
crabbed, to see everybody worship before the golden calf."&#xD;
"Jealous! upon my word! But Lucy you forget that if all the&#xD;
world shifted round, you were no less inconsistent by turning her&#xD;
Ny lfer having been her only supporter."&#xD;

Lucy made a disconnected attempt to disprove the charge; but&#xD;
her confusion only confirmed his opinion.&#xD;

Sth s love she had hesitated-now her brother's happiness was&#xD;
affected like her own and what she had' shrunk from doin ster&#xD;

Richard found his mother in her room. The excitement of the&#xD;
last two days had somewhat affected her nerves and Dr. Palmer&#xD;
who had called to see the children and on that occasionseen the&#xD;
mother, had advised an afternoon's retirement. She smil, wh&#xD;
Richard stepped into the room.&#xD;

Mrs. Fox shrugged her shoulders.&#xD;

circumstances had proved himself the worth  - recipient of thefr&#xD;
most fervent love, was yet absent. But hee&#xD;
n the taas to come 'adt that.&#xD;
fact alone was sufficient, to spread a glow of joyous anticipation&#xD;
over their faces, which cast its reflection even on Henry. Not that&#xD;
he had experienced much delight at the thought of soon meeting&#xD;
his brother--no, he was at best-very indifferent about it; but chis&#xD;
parents loved him moredearly on his brother's account, probably&#xD;
without knowing it themselves. He however knew it and this&#xD;
knowledge was hardly calculated to inspire himwith very warm&#xD;
feelings towards his brother, H. had always be&#xD;
t.h. faystbgrudged Charles&#xD;
place in his parents'love, without ever taking the trouble&#xD;
of finding the solution of that problem in his own short comings.&#xD;
To say the truth, his probation on the ocean had not improved&#xD;
him much if any, in spite of Captain Tarfield's laudator letter&#xD;
and if it hadn't been for the pleasant excitement of his parents;&#xD;
they would have seen it at once.&#xD;
Ever since the departure of the two sans Mr. Burlesque had&#xD;
been an inmate of the family. He had occupied Charlie's Tocnn&#xD;
and taken care of Charlie's pets and collection&#xD;
,mapn'asoletin at that young&#xD;
man's particular request. At first Mrs. Fuchs could not bear the&#xD;
ought of seeing a stranger installed in the room, where the&#xD;
spirit of her boy had left its impress on every sp bg u&#xD;
thmresoneer                        pot; but gradually&#xD;
ways of the new-comer and especially his enthusiasts&#xD;

ago received him under her particular care, and in her  ar&#xD;
affection, and Mr. uls1e o     apa adi       e particular&#xD;
afin  ndM. Burlesque 'vowed, that if he had improved' in&#xD;
these three years it was solely due, to the salutary influence of&#xD;
Charlie's mother.&#xD;
It was touching to see hoth&#xD;
ow these two persons now vied, to make&#xD;
the reception of the favorite a festival worthy of his merits. Mr.&#xD;
Burlesque spent all his spare hours in fixing up the room, in ar-&#xD;
ranging the books, dusting the glass-cases containing Charlie's&#xD;
collection of butterflies and insects; in polishing the memorable&#xD;
engine and, lastly;in painting new the cages and enclosures of the&#xD;
animals in the zoological department of the garden. Mrs. Fuchs&#xD;
in the meantime was hardly less busy in her department. She&#xD;

huslpand nodded and smiled at her bustle and activity, and so did&#xD;
Henry smile; but a careful observer would have noticed an in-&#xD;
gredient of bitter envy.in his smile, and that he ground his teeth&#xD;
when indulging in. this manifestation .of satisfaction. The obser-&#xD;
ver would have shook his head and wondered what this all would&#xD;
come to yet.&#xD;
Mr. Burlesque did not like the brother of his friend. He had&#xD;
mixed too much with society of every description as not to un-&#xD;
derstand the character of Henry. Burlesque. himself had been of&#xD;
rather loose habits and he surely was the last person to cast a&#xD;
stone at Henry for a similar weakness. But it was hardly for&#xD;
such a defect, that one would have taken the the young mariner&#xD;
to account. There was a certain something in him, which Bur-&#xD;
lesque felt but yet could not define: The comedian could think&#xD;
of nothing more fitting to compare him with, than the cat. When&#xD;
he saw Henry strolling about, his eyes half shut, his gait loiter-&#xD;
ing but his step noiseless and cautious, he could not help thinking&#xD;
of that animal. You stroke her and she sings and brushes her&#xD;
soft fur against you. She curves her back and whisk her tail-&#xD;
in short she shows every sign of supreme satisfaction. But you&#xD;
look into her eyes and you will perceive that expression of malig-&#xD;
nant cunning, of cruel heartlessness. which she cannot entirely&#xD;
banish. You also see the working of the claws,-they lie con-&#xD;
cealed the balls of the foot; but there is a nervous twitching in&#xD;
them, as if the animal was laboring under a strong temptation, to&#xD;
spread them out and sink them into the hand, which caresses it,.&#xD;
unconscious of its danger.&#xD;
Henry on the other hand seemed equally disinclined to make&#xD;
much of Mr. Burlesque. He spent most of his time in Richard's&#xD;
company and the two were more frequently seen at the mansion,&#xD;
then at the cottage. Their long companionship on board the ves-&#xD;
sel made the intimacy so natural, that their parents found nothing&#xD;
strange in it; but if they could have witnessed all their secret&#xD;
meetings and whispered conversations, they might perhaps have&#xD;
changed their opinion. The nearer the day of Charles arrival ap-&#xD;
preached, the more numerous did this interview become. Some-&#xD;
times Richard and Henry put their heads together and then again&#xD;
Richard and his sister might be seen in lively but guarded con-&#xD;
versation. It was on coming from one of; the latter, that we see&#xD;

the porch, indulging in his favorite amusement-smoking and&#xD;
idling-an&#xD;
"Co4le in Dick !" he cried, when he saw the other stopping at&#xD;
the gate.&#xD;
"No, you come down, Henry. I want to have a chat with you.&#xD;
Let us stroll up and down the road."&#xD;
Ienry would have preferred to     g h   -&#xD;

"It means, there is another page following this one, one in which&#xD;

"Ha! ha! I suppose, that was a bitter pill for you, Dick?"&#xD;

"That doesn't .make it apy sweeter. And this leaf you got&#xD;

"No, I didn't. To tell you the truth, Henry, your case doesn't&#xD;
lie any more favorably than mine. In fact I know she looks with&#xD;

succeeds, we- are done for; by his ruin we may effect our fortune."&#xD;
"You are right; but how can we accomplish our purpose."&#xD;
"By working into one another's hands. All that is necessary,&#xD;
is to induce your brother, to believe, that Dolores is faithless, or&#xD;
rather, that she does not love him-for I hardly think, that they&#xD;
have already plighied one another's faith."&#xD;
"And you hope to accomplish that, by placing this paper in his&#xD;

"Split me, if he does anything like it!"&#xD;
"Henry, you are a trying case. Have the kindness to hold your&#xD;
peace, until I have done. Where was I? Oh,. yes! a loving brother&#xD;
lies in his aims. He is agreeably surprised. His conscience tells&#xD;
him, that he has hardly deserved such love, and he resolves to&#xD;
make up for lost time. Arm-in-arm the affectionate couple step&#xD;
into the house. Enter delighted parents, with profusion of bles-&#xD;
sings. An affecting drama is put in scene: domestic happiness in&#xD;
one act. Persons: Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel!"&#xD;

told you, not to interrupt me. You make me lose my thread."&#xD;

something of a fool. Cain's friend has a hankering after Abel's&#xD;
mistress and has managed to get a leaf of her diary, in which she&#xD;
says, she doesn't love Abel."&#xD;

and stops his exit. Abel frowns and wonders; but Cain, emain-&#xD;

dear; you do not like my conduct, but you will appreciate it, when&#xD;
you read these lines. I don't want my brother to make a fool of&#xD;
himself."&#xD;
"Veryingenious Dicky; the deuce take me, if it isn't.&#xD;

"No, Sir, let me have the paper."&#xD;
"And you'll be sure, to act'your role to nature ?"&#xD;
"Never mind me; if you carry out your part of the programme&#xD;
as well as I'll play mine, you may be pretty sure of success. But&#xD;
then what will you gain by this?"&#xD;
"I'll gain this much thata cloud of distrust will rise between&#xD;
them and in a cloud, you know a good many tricks may be per-&#xD;
formed. Charles is a proud hasty fellow and Dolores is not slow,&#xD;
to resent insults. If we can only raise a spark of discord be-&#xD;
tween them, we shall soon manage to fan it into a flame."&#xD;
well, may be, we can; it is worth trying anyhow. But J am&#xD;
tired of'walking any further; come let's go home and have a glass&#xD;
of wine.&#xD;
"I have no objection, Hen; but before we return, let us fix on&#xD;
some certain signal, by which you can without delay inform me&#xD;
ofm our brother's coming. It is essential that I should receive&#xD;
p      instant warning.&#xD;
"How would the flagstaff on the cottage do? I could run up a.&#xD;
*:     small streamer, to let you know."&#xD;
"Exactly. We can easily perceive it. from the mansion; but&#xD;
when do you exactly expect your brother?"&#xD;
"We got a letter this morning announcing his arrival on Sun-&#xD;
day morning next."&#xD;
"Then he'll come with the night brain?" -   .&#xD;
"That's the calculation,"&#xD;
"And you will fetch him from the depot?"&#xD;
"Father or Burlesque I suppose. I hate to get up so early in&#xD;
the morning."&#xD;
Richard thought a moment.a,&#xD;
&#xD;
impending visit at the mansion. It is essential, that I should&#xD;
play the agreeable lover just in time for him, to see the sight."&#xD;
"That's true. I have an idea, Dolores wouldn't let you play the&#xD;
sentimental swain any length of time."&#xD;
"Don't you fret. I'll do it Sir and do it well; but what abont&#xD;
the second signal?"&#xD;
"Why, I have a dozen streamers in my trunk. I can easily run&#xD;
up a second one, as soon as he starts off for the mansion."&#xD;
"And they'll think, you are flagging in honor of his arrival.&#xD;
Ha! ha! That will be capital !"&#xD;
"Yes so it will no doubt; but a glass of wine and a good cigar&#xD;
are not to be despised neither. Here is the house. I am tired&#xD;
enough to drop right down. Come in! come in Sir !"&#xD;
Richard could not well refuse. He liked a glass of wine, espec-&#xD;
ially, when it was as good as that of Mr. Fuchs and then, he had&#xD;
to humor Henry, who was an indispensable accomplice. So the&#xD;
two went in and Henryhgot the key and a few minutes afterwards&#xD;
the wine sparkled in the glasses before their eyes. Sitting on&#xD;
easy chairs and puffing their fragrant havannas, they sipped their&#xD;
wine with a relish and a deep tranquillity, as if the most' angelic&#xD;
business instead of a fiendish plot had just now been transacted&#xD;
between them. They talked about their cruises and one word&#xD;
chasing the other, it was nearly evening before Richard recollec-&#xD;
ted that he had only intended to stay a few minutes and that bus-&#xD;
iness of the most important kind was waiting for him at theouse.&#xD;
He had only a few days to operate in and no minute was to be-&#xD;
lost.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
A MITTEN.&#xD;
When he reached the mansion, the bell just rang for supper and&#xD;
he hastened to join the family in a very pleasant meal. The many&#xD;
topics, which a long absence from home had accumulated were&#xD;
not half exhausted and the conversation sprang playfully from&#xD;
one subject to another, touching them lightly and merely extract-&#xD;
ing their cream. After supper Mrs. Fox retired to her room, Mr.&#xD;
Fox to his library and the two girls and Richard went to the par-&#xD;

bor. The days were not only getting short but cold and the grate&#xD;
therefore contained -a cheerful fire. The room was as elegant as&#xD;
comfortable and Richard felt a keen; feeling of satisfaction, when&#xD;
he dropped into the swelling cushions of an armchair, exchang-&#xD;
ing occasional remarks now with Dolores, now with Lucy. The&#xD;
open instrument called his mind to music.&#xD;
"Dolores, I have not heard you play" he said "and yet they&#xD;
tell me, that you excel jin music as much as in everything else.&#xD;
Will you have the kindness to perform for me?"&#xD;
"You have learnhd to turn your phrases well enough for a tar.&#xD;
I shall play for you on condition, that you will hereafter exclude&#xD;
the unwholesome element of flattery from your remark to me."&#xD;
"I'll do most anything to please you."&#xD;
Dolores shrugged her shoulders, as if to say: why, you are in -&#xD;
corrigible! Perhaps to gratify his.wish, perhaps to escape further&#xD;
adulation from his lips, she rose and took the seat before the in-&#xD;
strument. Running her fingers up and down the keys and elicit-&#xD;
ing from them some rapid passages like as many silver pearls, she&#xD;
involuntarily, yes imperceptibly fell into the air of home, sweet&#xD;
home! which she worked into an everchanging stiring of varia-&#xD;
tions. Like every true artist, she forgot, that she was perform-&#xD;
ing a task, even that she played before somebody. While her&#xD;
fantasy raised its wings higher and higher, her thoughts began to&#xD;
wander back, far back into the past. She saw a sicJ and falter-&#xD;
ing ministrel in the street with a little girl at his side, and a tear&#xD;
slipped down her eheek as an offering to the memory of the dead.&#xD;
Then she ran over the years that followed, varying her music in&#xD;
accordance with the gayer or sadder subjects of her thought. She&#xD;
saw the cottage and its inmates, the parsonage with the quaint&#xD;
but noble pair, the ocean and the cave and the exciting scenes&#xD;
she there went through. Next her school-life rose up to view, the&#xD;
Frenchman with his cut and dried perfection, the odd but genial&#xD;
German, the model principal and her prince consort. Then came&#xD;
the contest, the homeward journey and arrival....&#xD;
She gave a start., She did not know how long she had been&#xD;
playing. Richard didn't either. He thought it had been very&#xD;
tiresome; but of course kept his thought unto himself. When&#xD;
Dolores had begun, he had penciled a short note and shoved it&#xD;
to his sister, in consequence of which she had risen and retired&#xD;
&#xD;
.DOLORES.                     319&#xD;
so' softly, as to escape the notice of the performer  Aft  th&#xD;
Richard had wished, that Dolores, would sto  H  didn't a&#xD;
about 'music! he didn't understand it! nothing but thumping,&#xD;
dingling, gingling, anyhow. If she would only stop! ! pOfc g&#xD;
he couldn't hint his wishes! He couldn't begin to entertaintrse&#xD;
thought of causing her displeasure. She'll get tired at last&#xD;
There, now, she's closing. Now is the time Dick!r&#xD;
Dolores rose rapidly from her stool. On noticing Luy'&#xD;
drawal, a shadow passed over her brow. Jealous! for ever jeal-&#xD;
ois! were the words which passed through he    r  .  je&#xD;
thought was natural, for of course she didn't know anything&#xD;
about Richard's manoeuvres.&#xD;
"I must have tired you Richard" she said taking her book and&#xD;
handkerchief from the table; evidently preparing herself for re-&#xD;
tirement "but you will undoubtedly pardon the offence on th&#xD;
promise of its nonrecurrence."&#xD;
"I have nothing to pardon you Dolores; but rather to thank&#xD;
for the entertainment. But I am in a mood for asking favors ou&#xD;
evening: will you have the kindness, to take your chair and vouch-&#xD;
safe me a few minutes' conversation? I shall not detain you long.&#xD;
Dolores.smiled; but she resumed her previous positiong.&#xD;
rocking-chair,&#xD;
"I never had an idea, that the ocean was such a good school&#xD;
for politeness. It will hardly do, to slight so respectful a solici ta&#xD;
tion, especially if the petitioner is a brother."&#xD;
The word "brother" seemed to grate on Richard's ear  H&#xD;
could not suffer her to put that bar between herself and h' a&#xD;
rations.&#xD;
"No, not of a brother Dolores. Understand me right: It would&#xD;
make me happy to sustain that relation to one so ood  nobld&#xD;
and accomplished, if I wss not ambitious, of assug, so noble,&#xD;
more intimate and sacred. Dolores I tremble more before your&#xD;
sight than I did during the raging of the tempest Spare meur&#xD;
further explanation and tell me, that you understand me"&#xD;
She did understand him; but her sensations-on discovering his&#xD;
meaning were anything but pleasant. She felt like oneo  s&#xD;
a venomous serpent winding at his face, ready to fasten its loathi&#xD;
coils around 'him in unrequited tenderness. But she hno soone&#xD;

unworthy of her generous nature.  If Richard had once wand-&#xD;
ered astray, he had atoned by a long and\painful probation. There&#xD;
was no dishonor to her in his avowal and this idea having strug,&#xD;
gled.to the surface of her mind, her .original indignation and re-&#xD;
pugnance changed to deep compassion. She thought of Charles&#xD;
and her love for him, and how she would feel on being spurned&#xD;
and loathed, as she had first intended, that Richard now should&#xD;
be. Of course it did not'take her more than a second, to let these&#xD;
thoughts flash through her mind, and there had been hardly a&#xD;
pause, when she replied:&#xD;
"It would be unworthy of me and trifling with you, to pretend,&#xD;
I didn't understand you, Richard. I do understand you, but it is&#xD;
my painful duty, to warn you not to proceed. I cannot, never&#xD;
will be able to listen to your wishes, and the sooner you desist&#xD;
from your efforts, the more will you spare your own feelings and&#xD;
mine."&#xD;
Richard knew, that this would be her answer; moreover he was&#xD;
merely acting the passionate lover for a purpose; yet, when he&#xD;
heard himself thus premptorily refused, he felt a burning ire aris-&#xD;
ihg within him. He felt like hurling his defiance at the head of&#xD;
this proud beauty; who spoke, or thought at least any aspira-&#xD;
tions to her hand on his part mere presumption.' Indeed for a&#xD;
moment he was in great danger of falling from his role-and&#xD;
many a bitter hour would such an ocurrence have spared the girl&#xD;
before him-but unfortunately he governed himself in time to&#xD;
hide his emotions. Assuming a sad and reproachful tone he said:&#xD;
"Dolores, have you really the heart of shutting thus on me the&#xD;
ate of heaven, without any chance of entrance whatever? If&#xD;
you forbid a fellow thus peremptority, to love you, why don't you&#xD;
wear a veil? why don't you hide your dazzling beauty, your bril-&#xD;
liant mind, your high accomplishments within a convent's walls?&#xD;
Con you blame the person, who, warmed and cheered by the&#xD;
genial sun, ventures to raise his eyes to his blending glory?"  j&#xD;
"No Richard, I would not blame him, I would pity him, as I&#xD;
pity you; for his wishes would be as unattainable, as yours. HQa-&#xD;
yen forbid, that I should compare my humble self with that hea-&#xD;
venly luminary-but you choose the figure and I borrowed it for&#xD;
convenience sake. I am sorry for you, Richard, extremely sorry&#xD;
and would give you a year of my existence, to restore your peace&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
of mind, Requite your feelings I cannot and feel in honor  d&#xD;
in conscience bound, to tell you so, without duplicity."&#xD;
He sighed--perhaps the sigh was no longer mere acting  f  t&#xD;
was almost impossible, to see this glorious creature in heg,for&#xD;
reserve and not become impressed..gran&#xD;
"Ah! Dolores! If you.but knew, how much more lovely     -&#xD;
dignfied refusal is making you in my sight, ou w   d have&#xD;
chosen a different mode of checking the ardor of m  would Lhave&#xD;
at me, mock, scorn me, tread me in the dust--ony dontwaugh&#xD;
yourself in this celestial light, which pains my eyes and  rep&#xD;
me to destruction like the moth that is drawn into the aure&#xD;
of the burning taper."e autodafe&#xD;
Dolores rose to her feet. She smiled in spite of herlf&#xD;
"Richard, you are too flowery, in your speaking for n  tht'&#xD;
just going to die. I do not say, that you desire to deceive me ---&#xD;
far be it from me !--but I think, you ard&#xD;
have only seen me one day and thatrwas hardly long enoughYo&#xD;
period, to conceive so desperate a passion. If you examinough a&#xD;
feelings a little more closely, you will find, that the  aine con-&#xD;
siderable portion of that spontaneous gallantry for which you&#xD;
seamen are noted. Allow me, to wish you a very peasant night."&#xD;
Dropping a deep courtesy, she was on the po  eainghe&#xD;
room, when Richard's voice once more stopped her. He had risen&#xD;
and there was an element of truthfulness in his voice, when he&#xD;
cried :                                       iehnh&#xD;
"Dolores! stop! for heavens sake, sto  on&#xD;

gay words pierced my heart like daggers, ou s ly one of your&#xD;

Dolores was a young and inexperienced girl; yet a certain in-&#xD;
tuition enabled her, to distinguish between reality and acting.&#xD;
She felt, that deep passion binds the tongue, instead of losening&#xD;
it and that even the post gifted mind forgets its cunning and&#xD;
trembles and stammers in the presence of the loved one. So, al-&#xD;
though she did not doubt, that Richard felt something of the feel-&#xD;
ing he professed, she was convinced that lie was guilty of over-&#xD;
drawing perhaps intentionally perhaps unintentionly. She felt as&#xD;
if she ought to check this game at once. If she indulged him,&#xD;
that pain, which now she thought, was mere pretension, might be-&#xD;
ome reality. It would not do-a german book had told her,-&#xD;
to paint the devil on the wall. So turning to the passionate&#xD;
young ipan with a resolute face, she said firmly, though with kind-&#xD;
ness:&#xD;
"Richard you ask impossibilities. To smile on you would be&#xD;
to encourage you and that I can not do conscientiously. If you&#xD;
understand my decision to be irrevocable, you will cease, to waste&#xD;
your best strength in useless efforts. To now encourage you and&#xD;
then at last repel your homage. would be the conduct of a coq-&#xD;
uette-I am no coquette, Richard, Wand though I now may hurt&#xD;
your feelings, I mean well. Let ut forget, what passed between&#xD;
us and be assured, that, if I cannot listen to your wishes just ex-&#xD;
pressed,---I shall always be to you a true and faithful sister.&#xD;
The nod, with which she left the room, had nothing of the&#xD;
former mocking playfulness. It was grave and sympathetic, but&#xD;
on Richard it had the same effect. He could hardly wait for the&#xD;
door to shut upon the departing form,-to burst into a raging&#xD;
passion and to shake his fists in the direction, where Dolores had&#xD;
left.&#xD;
"Wait, madam!" he cried. "I'll teach you manners before you&#xD;
are many days older, b I'll teach you to spurn the offer of a man&#xD;
without whose assistance you'll always remain, what you are now&#xD;
--a beggar-girl. Mock princess now-your proud neck will gladly&#xD;
stoop, as soon as you learn, that I can all at once transform you&#xD;
in a real princess."&#xD;

Merrily the whip in SMr. Burlesque's hand cracked through the&#xD;
morning air, when on Sunday morning' htidviulrtre&#xD;
From the depo  ih   ht    y monig that individual returned&#xD;

imsf ha te there long ago. On jumping down Charles found&#xD;
himself in the embrace of a youth, that could be nobody but his&#xD;
hardly county nd set he somehow, without knowing why, had&#xD;
hardly cned on such warm reception on his part. But there&#xD;
he was and smiling too and if the thought of a mistake had still&#xD;
"Wn has, the other's address set every doubt aside.&#xD;
"why Charlie, how you stare: dont you know your brother&#xD;
"I thk                              o   ou    rt e&#xD;

"I thought you were Henry, only...&#xD;
"Only you had hardly expected such merry welcome from his&#xD;
flps? of  ha '  iis not fair, to charge the man with the&#xD;
folly of the boy."hte&#xD;
"God forbid I should Henry. Nobody can rejoice&#xD;
ait the thought, that the disagreeable jarring betw  us  than &#xD;
no more. You know, I never meant you harm, Henry."&#xD;
"Yes, Charlie, I know now; but there is moth&#xD;
within her hear forkt.er, scolding me&#xD;
heart, for keeping you away from her emb&#xD;
up at once-I can afford-to come in afterwards".&#xD;
A moment after Charles lay in hi&#xD;

change of salutations. "My pleasure at seeing you, will no longer&#xD;
embittered by the thought of losing you again."&#xD;
"But mother, I am even now meditating on a chance of leaving&#xD;
you&#xD;
His smile assured her of the harmlessness of his intentions.&#xD;
She thought, she knew what he alluded to.&#xD;
'You are, you wicked boy," she answered with that roguish&#xD;
plainness so peculiar to her. "That is a mother's fate all the&#xD;
world over. Hardly weaned, you youngsters desert her and run&#xD;
after the apron-strings of some blue-eyed girl with rosy cheeks&#xD;
and dimples."                      -&#xD;
Charles blushed and thereby proved the correctness of her&#xD;
supposition. Mr. Fuchs also began to see.&#xD;
"Ah, the wind blows from that direction, does it?"-he asked.&#xD;
"Of course, Conrad, didn't you see it all at once? If we force&#xD;
him to squint at the mansion much longer, we'll have him cross-&#xD;
eyed before night."&#xD;
Mr. Fuchs laughed. He enjoyed a joke as much as anyone on&#xD;
festive occasions and his son's return was a festival of the first&#xD;
magnitude.&#xD;
"We cannot load snch dreadful risk upon our conscience, can&#xD;
we mother?" he suggested.M&#xD;
Charles fell from one confusion into another. It is a good sign,&#xD;
to see a young man of twenty-one blush-some have forgotten&#xD;
how, at the age of fifteen. He tried to laugh it all away, but&#xD;
laughing made it rather worse than better, for before he knew it,&#xD;
they all had joined him and were enjoying their merriment at his&#xD;
expense.&#xD;
At last his mother had mercy on him. Taking his -hand and&#xD;
fondling it, she said:&#xD;
"Now father, leave my boy alone, will you. We have seen him&#xD;
once every year. and a certain young lady has been obliged to&#xD;
forego that pleasure for more than three years. Go my son, and&#xD;
follow the dictates of your heart; we do not blame yon for obey-&#xD;
its instincts. Only don't stay too long, and bring our Dol along,&#xD;
that we may bless her, and feast our eyes upon a sight, which re-&#xD;
alizes the ardent wishes of our hearts."&#xD;
'"Oh, mother, you are the best of women! You need never fear,&#xD;
that she'll dispute the first place in my heart with you."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.       /&#xD;
&#xD;
"I knoweit Charles; but tell us before you go: were you success-&#xD;
(iii in the contest?"&#xD;
Theform of the young man seemed to grow. A fire of pride&#xD;
and conscious strength kindling in his eye, he said :&#xD;
"Yes, mother, I'm going, to lay the first prize at Dolores' feet."&#xD;
"I knew it!" his mother said, her voice echoing his triumph&#xD;
'But Charlie you'll give but to receive. Dolores is fully your&#xD;
equal. She too out-distanced all competition."&#xD;
"You tell me nothing new, mother. I saw it in the girl the first&#xD;
day she paid a visit to our house. But will you really pardon me&#xD;
for leaving you for half-an-hour?"&#xD;
"For double that time, Charlie, and with all our hearts too&#xD;
But don't forget this condition : you must indemnify us for our&#xD;
loss of time by returning with your better half."&#xD;
Charles was in danger of becoming the prey t a second con-&#xD;
fusion, and only escaped it by running from the room, In the&#xD;
hall he took his hat, and clearing the steps of the pclrch with one&#xD;
spring, he was on the point of passing through the gate, when&#xD;
Henry's voice stopped him:&#xD;
"Charles! indulge me just a moment: I want to talk to you on&#xD;
matters of importance."&#xD;
"Exactly, Henry, I am at your service, that iscif you will just&#xD;
consent to postpone the discussion to this afternoon. If your&#xD;
affairs are important, others still more important demand my&#xD;
presence at the mansion."&#xD;
Henry shook his head, and looked at Charles with such a queer&#xD;
expression, that the young man started.&#xD;
"I knew the object of your errand, Charlie, and if I tell you&#xD;
that my communication directly bears upon it-will you then&#xD;
vouchsafe me a short interview?"&#xD;
Charles evidently was far from understanding his brother yet;&#xD;
but a vague fear arose in his heart, that threatened to suffocate&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"You want to tell me something of-of Dolores?"&#xD;
Henry nodded. Charlie's eye kindled. Setting his teeth to-&#xD;
gether, he said:&#xD;
"Henry, beware! I am very touchy on that- one point, and the&#xD;
slightest abuse of her I worship might put atj eopardy the rel&#xD;
tion which has begun under such good auspices.'&#xD;

DOLOREs.&#xD;
&#xD;
Henry nodded like a man that has well and carefully consid-&#xD;
ered the consequences of his actions.&#xD;
"I know-it, Charles, I know how unpleasant is the office of the&#xD;
person, who advises us for our best interests against our inclina-&#xD;
ation. The surgeon's cut, which precedes the process of heal-&#xD;
ing, is even more painful than salutary."&#xD;
Charles chafed under his brother's remark, like the steed that&#xD;
strikes the ground with a restive foot; but Henry had so well se-&#xD;
cured his bridle, that all his brother's efforts to get lose were idle.&#xD;
saw it, and from that moment felt sure of his victory.&#xD;
"Henry, if you had no other object, than to entertain me with&#xD;
stale similes and well established axioms... .&#xD;
"No, YCharlie, you know, that that is not my object. It is so&#xD;
painful, tho' to hurt the feelings of those we love."&#xD;
"I absolve you from all delicacy, Henry, on condition that you&#xD;
hurry on with this affair.  What have you to tell me, speak !"&#xD;
So pressed, henry saw no evasion. Taking his brother's arm&#xD;
and leading him in the direction of the factory, he said:&#xD;
"Charles, tell me truly: do you go to the mansion with the pur-&#xD;
pose of offering yourself as a wooer for Dolores's affection? I&#xD;
do not ask from idle curiosity."&#xD;
"Yes, Sir, I do. There is no need of hiding the existence of a&#xD;
feeling, which constitutes the pride of my life."&#xD;
"I thought so," Henry said with a sigh. "But have you ever&#xD;
f    by word or letter exchanged your vows of love?"&#xD;
"You are inquisitive. But I shall construe your curiosity as&#xD;
dictated by the feelings you profess. My answer is: no, Sir, we&#xD;
have never spoken or written about love to one another and the&#xD;
whole rich treasure of delight is still in store for us."&#xD;
"But Charles"-Henry stopped walking and took his brother&#xD;
by the arm-"has it never struck you, that there is a bare poss -&#xD;
bility, of your feelings being unrequited?"&#xD;
If Charles had been turned into a statue, he could not have&#xD;
been more immovable, as he was for the period of five minutes.&#xD;
Only by degrees his dumbness seemed to leave him, and at last he&#xD;
was able to utter:&#xD;
"Henry, this question-has a meaning-Recollect, what I told&#xD;
you of the risk-you run: Do you know anything to the con-&#xD;
trary?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Before I answer your reply, I would simply state, that I am.&#xD;
no informer. If any act of Dolores, by which she may have&#xD;
given away her heart to any-body else casts a reflection on her&#xD;
character, 1 have no, more to say."&#xD;
"Don't worry me to death by your evasions, Henry. I never&#xD;
said .or did anything, which would have made it wrong in her, to&#xD;
love somebody else. Now go on ! go on !"&#xD;
"Your statement relieves me, Charlie. I am now free to give&#xD;
the reasolls, that make me think, that Dolores looks at you in the&#xD;
light of a dear friend, but nothing more. Firstly Richard has&#xD;
intimated to me....&#xD;
"Henry!"&#xD;
This word pronounced with virtuous indignation, brought the&#xD;
calumniator to a stop.&#xD;
"Do you think the say-so of a fool and knave sufficient ground,&#xD;
to weaken my faith in the purity of a girl like Dolores?"&#xD;
"I do not, Charlie, and if you will allow meAo proceed, I shall&#xD;
be able to convince you. The statement of Richard-on what&#xD;
ground you bestow those flattering epithets on him, however, I&#xD;
am at a loss to comprehend-his statement alone, I say, would&#xD;
not have induced me to seek this interview. But if it is sustained&#xD;
by testimony from the lady's own hand, it is certainly worthy of&#xD;
some consideration."&#xD;
"You understand how to apply all the means of a slow torture."&#xD;
"No, Charlie. I am nearly through. The other day, when I&#xD;
entered the park for the purpose of paying a visit to the family,&#xD;
I saw a piece of paper slowly fluttering from the upper story,&#xD;
which after numerous evolutions and somersaults alighted at my&#xD;
feet. Inffuenced by an almost unconscious curiosity, I picked up&#xD;
the paper and would surely have thrown it away as fast as I had&#xD;
seized it, if I had not recognized Dolores' handwriting. Mother&#xD;
had shown; me several letters of hers,.and there is so much attrac-&#xD;
tion in the beautiful handwriting, and the more beautiful thoughts&#xD;
of those letters, that I could not resist the temptation of scan-&#xD;
ning the lines in my hand. If I did wrong, the supposition, that&#xD;
a paper so freely passed, could not contain a secret, must be my&#xD;
excuse."&#xD;
"And this paper-you have it yet?"&#xD;

every word of this question,; awakened in Henry's mind the con-&#xD;
sciousness of the great danger, to which he had exposed himself.&#xD;
His position was-similar to that of the man, who shares the lion's&#xD;
cage, and knows, that his safety depends on his assurance-a&#xD;
single step back, and the lion will tear him to pieces.&#xD;
"Yes Charles, I have it yet. I kept it for the purpose of show-&#xD;
ing it to you. I somehow had. an intuitive perception that things&#xD;
would just come about, as they have done and, much as I loathed&#xD;
the thought of paining you, I preferred it to the other of seeing&#xD;
you the subject of, humiliating ridicule or even deception."&#xD;
"The paper ! the paper !"&#xD;
Henry took a portfolio from his pocket and from it drew a&#xD;
paper, which he handed to his brother. Charles at once recog-&#xD;
nized the hand of her, that was so dear to him. His eyes swam&#xD;
and it took some minutes, kefore he was steady enough to read.&#xD;
He proceeded and it was a painful sight to witness this perusal.&#xD;
Henry, hypocrite that he was, took'care to look in another direct-&#xD;
tion, while his brother was thus engaged. The paper ran:&#xD;
Very likely the last letter, I'll ever get from him. One&#xD;
more 'week and I shall have ceased to be the happy school-girl,&#xD;
to enter into a state not less laborious and even more responsible.&#xD;
One more week to prepare for the contest! I ought to concen-&#xD;
trate my thoughts upon my studies; but I cannot do it. How-&#xD;
ever much I struggle to retain them here, they constantly fly to&#xD;
my native home and to the dear dear face, I shall there meet&#xD;
again.&#xD;
There is a picture of Charles in the letter, a splendid photo-&#xD;
graph. He wears a moustache now and handsome whiskers and&#xD;
I 'was so much engaged with looking at the picture, that I didn't&#xD;
notice, how one of the girls came yp. behind and gazing over my&#xD;
shoulders, saw the picture. I started like a thief detected in&#xD;
the act of stealing, when she elapped her hands and with a merry&#xD;
laugh exclaimed:&#xD;
"A man! a man! Our Lady Perfeet has the picture of a man!&#xD;
He is handsome tho' and I'll keep mum, if you will on the spot&#xD;
confess, who he is and 'whether you love him very much?"&#xD;
Ifelt a burning in my face-of indignation I think it was at&#xD;
'    her indignation. Without deigning to answer a word to her&#xD;
question, I turned abruptly and sought my chamber. There how-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                      329&#xD;
ever her question haunts me all the time: Do I love him?--K&#xD;
Love him not...&#xD;
That was allso hut it was enough. No I love him not! Those&#xD;
words sounded in his ears, they echoed through his brain; they&#xD;
sounded like the sentence, with which the judge condemns the&#xD;
after the jury having found him guilty. It is hard to tell, how&#xD;
lofg Charles would have stood there on the road, staring at the&#xD;
-nftatprsper; if Henry had not reminded him of the neces-&#xD;
sity, to preserve the necessary composure before the people, who&#xD;
began to flock to church.&#xD;
"Come Charlie, bear it like a man" he said, and would have&#xD;
continue his consolations, if an impatient gesture of his brother&#xD;
had not stopped him&#xD;
"I know, what you would say and 'tis well enough. Yes Iam&#xD;
indebted to you for opening my eyes just in due time, to save me&#xD;
from making a fool of myself. If I had known this before my ar-&#xD;
rival, I should have invented an excuse for prolonging my ab-&#xD;
sence. As it is, I told mother, that I would go and see her. Very,&#xD;
well, I'll do just as I told her. Why shouldn't I? This egregious&#xD;
conceit of mine deserves a punishment. Moreover I must con-&#xD;
fess that I am curious to see what happiness she enjoys as the&#xD;
betrothed of such a fellow!"&#xD;
He spoke with so much bitterness, that Henry thought best to&#xD;
keep his peace. He was glad, when they reached the cottage, for&#xD;
he felt very much like ridding himself of the company of his vic-&#xD;
tim. After reaching his hand to the parting brother he walked&#xD;
up stairs, to hoist another streamer.&#xD;
"So!" he muttered "my duty is done Mr. Dick and yours be-&#xD;
gins. Itf you do your part as well as I did mine. success cannot&#xD;
be wanting. But if you fail-and that is very likely; for I, tell&#xD;
you,'tis hard to bamboozle him any length of time--if you fail, I&#xD;
say, I shall escape the penalty of my offence by making you the&#xD;
scape-goat. You must not think Mr. Dick, that I am the cat&#xD;
which hauls the chestnuts from the fire for you; not I. Indeed I&#xD;
think Charles wasn't so very wrong by calling him a fool-a fool&#xD;
and a--well Henry dont you be calling names... One or the other&#xD;
night keep sticking to you by mistake. He must be there now&#xD;
pretty nearly, and this child is too smart for you, to step into his&#xD;

way on coming home. I'll take the hook and line and try my&#xD;
luck at fishing."&#xD;
But let us now return to Charles and anticipate his arrival at&#xD;
the mansion a few minutes.&#xD;
Over the mansion the Sunday had broke as gloriously as over&#xD;
the cottage and when dark clouds were already gathering over&#xD;
the latter, sunshine was still shedding its pleasant glow upon the&#xD;
former. At breakfast the question of going to church had been&#xD;
raised Mr. andMrs. Fox had declared their intention of attending&#xD;
service and walking the short distance, in order to allow John the&#xD;
chance of a holiday. On hearing this determination Richard at&#xD;
once volunteerrd his company, because he wished that Dolores&#xD;
should stay at home, and felt convinced, that this would not hap.&#xD;
pen, unless she could do so without the prospect of. being unmoZ&#xD;
tested by his importunities. True, he had abstained from annoy-&#xD;
ing her; but he had not always been so successful in governing&#xD;
his looks, as his words and the conduct of Dolores had plainly,&#xD;
shown that she deemed it necessary, to be on the guard. Gen-&#xD;
erally Dolores was quick in joining any company like that pro-&#xD;
posed; but this time she pleaded an unprepared state of mind as&#xD;
an excuse for remaining at home. Lucy had received her instruc-&#xD;
tions from her' brother, and of course announced her purpose of&#xD;
going with her parents. Thus Dolores was to remain alone, and&#xD;
when the church-party had left the premises, and disappeared be-&#xD;
hind the bushes of the park, she felt a secret pleasure at being by&#xD;
herself. No doubt her thoughts wandered to the friend, who by&#xD;
this time had not only reached the cottage, but might be even on&#xD;
the way to the mansion, if his longing for a reunion was only half&#xD;
as ardent-as.her own. Perhaps the knowledge of that fact had&#xD;
had much to do with her remaining home from church; tho' when&#xD;
she asserted that she was not in a proper mood for devotional ex-&#xD;
ercises, she certainly told the truth.&#xD;
Dolores tried to take a book and read, but her eyes and mind&#xD;
both refused to perform their ordinary task. The air was so close,&#xD;
so oppressive in the house, that she felt the necessity of seeking&#xD;
the open air. Taking her shawl and straw hat, she descended to&#xD;
the portico and thence into the park. There she felt somewhat&#xD;
freer, and with every new step, her composure became more com-&#xD;
plete. She felt happy 'in the morning air,'in the consciousness of&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                        331&#xD;
her beloved one's close proximity. After strolling a while, she&#xD;
came to the seat, where several important moments of her life&#xD;
had shaped themselves. Would it exercise a salutary influence&#xD;
upon her destiny to-day? Could fate vouchsafe to her the hap-&#xD;
piness of receiving just there the friend that filled her heart to the&#xD;
exclusion of every other feeling?-She trembled at the mere thought&#xD;
of so much happiness--poor child, why not rather tremble, at the&#xD;
peril so much more real and near? You do not know, that Rich-&#xD;
ard, on some pretence or other has retraced his steps, and having&#xD;
climbed the fence of the park, is now concealed in your neigh&#xD;
borhood, ready to break in upon your peace, as soon as the ap-&#xD;
pearance of his adversary gives the signal! You do not know that&#xD;
everything combines to make the plot of the conspirators suc-&#xD;
cessful; you do not.know, that on seeing the impunity with which&#xD;
they act, a doubt arises in the mind of a neutral spectator, whether&#xD;
there is a ruling providence or not. Poor child, of all this you&#xD;
are ignorant, and yet the storm is- about to burst upon your de-&#xD;
voted head.&#xD;
The garden-gate has creaked; but she is too much absorbed in&#xD;
thought to hear it. Richard however has noticed it-his senses&#xD;
are impaired by passion. From his hiding place he sees a form&#xD;
passing through the bushes, tho' not with the eager step of the&#xD;
lover that goes to meet the mistress of his heart after an absence&#xD;
of years. If it is Charles, Henry must have been at work and&#xD;
considerably dampen his spirit. So much the better; his task will&#xD;
be comparatively easy then. Now he sees the features of the vis-&#xD;
itor through an opening-it is Charles. He goes to the house,&#xD;
he rings the bell, Susan opens and points to the park. He comes&#xD;
down the steps and walking towards the seat occupied by Dolores&#xD;
approaches rapidly. As yet he has not seen her, nor she him, but&#xD;
she seems to feel his presence, for she is getting restless-now is&#xD;
the time. Kneeling before her in theatrical fashion he cries:&#xD;
"Dolores !"&#xD;
A low scream from her lips betrays her surprise of seeing at&#xD;
her feet a person, whom she thought then far away; but Dolores&#xD;
is not apt to remain the prey of any involuntary emotion and she&#xD;
is on the point of rising and repelling the boldness of the in-&#xD;
truder when-listen! a step approaches,-behold! a face appears&#xD;
through the foliage. It is Charles! it is Charles and so'strong is&#xD;
&#xD;

332                     DOLORES.&#xD;
her emotion that for the first time in her life, she loses the con-&#xD;
trol of her body. Yet her soul flies out to meet him; she totally&#xD;
forgets the kneeling figure at her feet; she does not feel, how he&#xD;
takes her hand, she does not hear the stream of burning passion&#xD;
he pours into her ear. Her eye is riveted upon the approaching&#xD;
friend; but what is that? Is this face indicative of the rapture'&#xD;
she is feeling? What does that melancholy expression signify?&#xD;
Why is his step so slow? Now the sadness vanishes;. but it is&#xD;
not joy, that takes his place. His face grows stern and rigid; his&#xD;
eye does not even dwell on her; it seeks the ground, some object&#xD;
at her feet-merciful heavens ! the whole reality at once presents&#xD;
itself unto her mind. She sees him now..that kneels before her;&#xD;
she feels her hands engaged and that too with a grip, which baf-&#xD;
fles her efforts to disengage it; she hears the words, he still is&#xD;
pouring forth.&#xD;
"Light of my soul! I bless the day, that gave you birth, Dolores&#xD;
queen of my heart!"&#xD;
The immovable form across the way hears them too. His rigid&#xD;
features relax and a bitter smile of contempt flits over them  He&#xD;
turns-he does-he cannot mean to leave her, simply because a&#xD;
poltroon, a miserable creature of a man has dared to benefit by&#xD;
the commotion into which the very presence of the other has&#xD;
thrown her. He turns, he goes!&#xD;
"Charlie !"&#xD;
A world of expression lies in that one, that single cry; but&#xD;
Charles heeds it not. He does not even turn, a repelling motion&#xD;
of his hand is all his answer. It rather quickens his retreat and&#xD;
she sees him hastening from the ground, as if the furies drove&#xD;
him off.&#xD;
He is gone! but the wretch, whose work this is, still holds her&#xD;
hand, still kneels before her. Ha! that is more, than she can bear.&#xD;
For once her wrath throws off the rigid control, under which the&#xD;
passioned impulses of her soul are generally kept. She feels, as&#xD;
if she could raise her foot and crush him under her heel, as she&#xD;
would crush a spider. Now she is strong enough, to free her&#xD;
hand. A sudden jerk and she is loose from him. Her eye flashes&#xD;
with a fire, that makes him drop his face.&#xD;
"Wretch! miserable wretch!.am I sunk so low, as to have be-&#xD;
come the sport of your whims? How can you dare, to offend my&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       333&#xD;
ears a second time with words so full of loathing? Begone! be-&#xD;
gone I say, or I shall whip yon from my presence like a dog"&#xD;
How he shrinks under these scathing words, how he rise and&#xD;
sneaks away. He is gone, but full five minutes elapse before life&#xD;
returns unto the form, that stands with lifted hands and flashing&#xD;
eyes, like an inspirited statue of Nemesis. Alas, the flash of wrath&#xD;
has not only hit the offender,--.like a two edged sword it has pene-&#xD;
trated her own heart as well. She is angry with the despicable&#xD;
intruder, but she is more angry with herself, for granting him&#xD;
the spectacle of her weakness. She is also angry with the fugi-&#xD;
tive, more angry, than she ever thought she"could be at him&#xD;
What! has he so little faith in her to condemn her on a&#xD;
ances so trifling? Has he no more respect for her character and&#xD;
taste, than to entertain the supposition, that she could lower her-&#xD;
self to one like Richard? The more she thinks of it th&#xD;
his flight assumes the aspect of an insult and in the first fresh in-&#xD;
dignation she makes the vow of doing nothing on her part to&#xD;
rectify the error. If he thinks her so low and indiscrete as to&#xD;
be capable of throwing herself on a Richard's neck-well, let it&#xD;
be so. In case of a voluntary return and confession of his fault,&#xD;
she might endeavor to forgive hin; else--never.&#xD;
We see Dolores could be proud, as well as Charles. Indeed a&#xD;
character, that is a real cdaracter can hardly be imagined without&#xD;
pride. Pride is the support, which upholds a noble soul in its&#xD;
position and guards. it from becoming poluted by all that's low&#xD;
and mean. Dolores was proud and her pride upheld her in the&#xD;
severest trial of her life. No tear moistened her eye; keeping the&#xD;
solitude of her room, she paced the floor for hours. Nobody did&#xD;
see her do it; her door was locked and all day long nobody was&#xD;
allowed to enter, but they heard the hurried heavy step in spite&#xD;
of the carpet. At times that noise would cease and then no sign&#xD;
of life was perceptible in the room. Dolores did not appear at&#xD;
either dinner or supper, and all questions as to whether sh walt-&#xD;
ed food to be taken to her room, were answered in the negative&#xD;
She was not hungry she said, but suffering with a sick headache&#xD;
she wished to be left alone. If her parents had known the true&#xD;
state of affairs, they might have felt more alarmed and insisted&#xD;
upon admittance, to offer sympathy 'and consolation; but as&#xD;
Richard after his rude dismissal had hastened to show himself&#xD;
&#xD;

334                     DOLORES.&#xD;
in Church and as he took good care not to furnish his parents a&#xD;
clue to the strange conduct of the girl, they acquiesced in her&#xD;
refusal to grant adhnittance to her room, thinking that it might&#xD;
really be a little sickspell and that Dolores as a considerate girl&#xD;
wanted to spare them the sight .of any fretfulness engendered by&#xD;
her headache. So the poor girl had to fight the first stormy&#xD;
battle with her heart all alone. She had to struggle with the pas-&#xD;
sion, which can either bestow upon us the bliss of angels or the&#xD;
anguish of the doomed Her's was the latter destiny. The cup&#xD;
of sorrow was full to the brim and she refused to touch it with&#xD;
all the pride and energy of her soul. But the struggle was vain.&#xD;
As hour after hour passed on, her energy began to fail, her pride&#xD;
sank with it and then her head bowed down, her hands raised up&#xD;
the cup and her lips drew in the bitter drink until it was drained&#xD;
to the dregs. Then came the anguish and the woe ; the doubt of&#xD;
a ruling providence, the despair of ever trusting human heart&#xD;
again, the utter hopelesness of life and light and sunshine.&#xD;
Night set in, but not the end of Dolores suffering. No sleep&#xD;
came into her eyes that night and only when the sun rose in the&#xD;
skies, inaugurating another.day, Dolores thought that she had&#xD;
conquered and could venture to show her face unto the others.&#xD;
She made her appearance at the breakfast-table with her usual&#xD;
smile, but her face showed such a deadly paleness, that both her&#xD;
parents were frightened. They knew however, that Dolores would&#xD;
dislike to be annoyed, by any signs of their alarm and therefore&#xD;
abstained from asking questions; but when breakfast was over,;&#xD;
Mr. Fox took his hat and that of his foster-child and putting it&#xD;
upon her head and tying it with his own hands, he said to her:&#xD;
"Come, Dol; you and I will have a walk. It will do you good&#xD;
after your sickspell."&#xD;
And Dolores, who had thought herself proof against all tribu-&#xD;
lation, was so touched by his act and words of kindness, that the&#xD;
clear tears stepped at once into her eyes and made them swim.&#xD;
She thought she had burned her heart with all its woe; but alas!&#xD;
the human heart is a strange enigma. Some say that it may&#xD;
break and I am not inclined to dispute the assertion. But this&#xD;
I know, it is extremely hard to bury it and ignore its feelings.&#xD;
Bury it as much as you please: it will thrust its shoots from out&#xD;
the grove and bear fruit -with wonderful rapidity. [t may be&#xD;

wormwood and bitterness that grow on them, but live and feed it&#xD;
will and any attempts to deaden it, will only increase its vi&#xD;
So in Dolores'case. She did not refuse, nor did she&#xD;
but suffering herself to be led into the park sho e consent&#xD;
ness and indifference of a little child  But th pred  not re&#xD;
sufficient scope, Mr. Fox thought, for a good faguidnoakian&#xD;
such a one he wanted. Therefore tie passed thegate withher,&#xD;
and turning to the right, manifested his intention of goinghpaer&#xD;
the cottage. Then Dolores showed signs of lif   g   g past&#xD;
"No, pa, not that way ! not that way !" she said-fe-&#xD;
verish haste, that he was more seriously alarmed th  such aie&#xD;
stopped and taking her ha    eweyalarmed than before. He&#xD;
stoped nd  an  her head between both his hands, loe&#xD;
searchingly into her eyes  T               shns looked&#xD;
seachigl ino er ye. The same phenomenon! They sto&#xD;

welled up osrnlta        h , and this times the bitter drops&#xD;
w       p so strongly, that they passed the brim and trickled&#xD;
"Child, my dear good child, what  - the matter?" Mr. Fox said&#xD;
in a voice that plainly showed his great alarm. "It is not sick -&#xD;
ness, that lsyou aHasanybody dared to harm you? Dol, let&#xD;
ty, father know, and rest assured, that you have all his sympa-&#xD;
o       h    lp-for that may not avail you anything."&#xD;
Dolores shook her head ; but Mr. Fox persisted in his efforts.&#xD;
Q "If you refuse, to go that way, Dol--have you any objection to&#xD;
the Opposite direction. You have not, well let us go towards the&#xD;
t   t then; one way answers me as well,; as another. Perhaps&#xD;
the sight of the ocean will widen your heart and induce&#xD;

He led her on in silence, until they had passed the  -l a&#xD;
the bay and the distant sea burst into view. The sightage and&#xD;
majestic ocean has indeed some soothing element  i&#xD;
Dolores felt it. A deep sigh rung itself loose from  hr ippand&#xD;
bosom and she leaned more trustingly upon her guide, thrse&#xD;
had done before. Mr. Fox pressed her to his heart&#xD;
"That is right Dol" he said with low and gentle t  c&#xD;
true your caresses as an indication of your wish tons.de o&#xD;

way. Tell me, has not the arrival, of Charlie Fuchs something&#xD;
to do with your distress ?"&#xD;
He felt her body shrink in his embrace. So he had guessed the&#xD;
truth.&#xD;
"You see, I was correct?" he said somewhat gayly. That is be-&#xD;
cause I symphatize with you and comprehend you better, than the&#xD;
rest. But now, make a clean heart of it Dol and let me know the&#xD;
whole story. Perhaps I may help you after all."-&#xD;
She shook her head sadly; but she struggled no longer and&#xD;
gave him a sketch of yesterday's events. To do her justice she&#xD;
passed over Richard's offence as lightly as possible and abstained&#xD;
even from making commentaries on Charles' conduct. When she&#xD;
was through, Mr. Fox breathed a sigh of relief-.&#xD;
"Well, Dol" he said, "that is a sad story, no donbt of it and I&#xD;
can imagine what you must have suffered yesterday. But then&#xD;
the case is by no means hopeless and if you'll let me, I shall this&#xD;
very morning go to the cottage and set things right. Now don't&#xD;
you fear anything, child" he continued, when Dolores made a mien&#xD;
to contradict, "your honor is safe in my hands, I can assure you,&#xD;
and I shall neither say or do anything, that is incompatible with&#xD;
it .I'll make what you might call a tour of inspection, that is, I&#xD;
mean to stick out my feelers and see how matters stand. Nor&#xD;
will I be absent long; but return to you and report, just as soon&#xD;
as I know how things look,"&#xD;
To this Dolores could have no reasonable objection and when&#xD;
the two retraced their steps after a while, she felt considerably&#xD;
more lighter hearted, than before. While walking Mr. Fox touch-&#xD;
ed some minor points.&#xD;
"I wondered yesterday at Charlie's absence from the mansion&#xD;
and so did Mrs. Fox; but then your sickness was the all absorb-&#xD;
ing topic of our thoughts and conservation. Now of course I&#xD;
marvel no longer at his failing to pay us a visit : but I wonder&#xD;
with you, that the rhetorical exercises of that jackanapes of a&#xD;
sailorboy should have made such an impression upon his mind.&#xD;
Richard is my boy and I don't deny him a father's feelings; but&#xD;
when it comes to a comparison between him and Charlie, I know&#xD;
well enough, how I would choose, if I was a girl."&#xD;
This undisguised praise of her ideal added still more to the&#xD;
reaction taking place within her heart. When. they reached the&#xD;

from it a book, she returned to her father's side as quickly  lighe&#xD;
had left it. Her face had undergone a perfect change. A light&#xD;
of heavenly joy streamed from her eyes; the color had returned with&#xD;
to lips and cheeks with marvelous quickes ad aksenfo wthe&#xD;

Dolores had folded her hands while saying this, looking the&#xD;
very picture of consternation. Mr. F x looked at her inquiringly.&#xD;
What can you meanDol? Explain yourself."&#xD;
No, father, please do not demand this. By obeying our in-&#xD;

"Ihunderstand you, Dol" Mr. Fox replied and his face grew pale&#xD;
"such spirits might indeed make sad havoc on our domestic peace&#xD;
But are you sure, that the leaf was not loct by hazard ?"&#xD;
"This very leaf, father?" she inquired with bitterness of tone;&#xD;
t et it be so; yes let that be the construction we put upon&#xD;

"Yes Dolores let us try it. If you, the deepest injured party&#xD;

you show but little curiosity, to hear the con clusion of my story."&#xD;
"Oh yes, I did forget, that you did not tell me all yet.  ou&#xD;
ave fad to explain your meaning, when you stated, that Charles&#xD;
was not in the village now."&#xD;
"Yes, that is it. A bitter pill yet remains to be swallowed-&#xD;

Dolores took the letter. It was but a short note and ran as&#xD;
follows:&#xD;

All joy had vanished from the poor girl's heart, while reading&#xD;
3ote.Ter started once more into&#xD;
this short but to her eloquent note. Tearssn        e&#xD;
lier eyes and for ten minutes she indulged in a good crying spell..&#xD;
The great trial she had borne bravely; but under this compara-&#xD;
tively light disappointment she gave away. So it is in life ; the&#xD;
man that storms a battery at the head of a regiment often shrinks&#xD;
from having his tooth-pulled. Mr. Fox let her have her way for&#xD;
a little while; then he laid his hand on her head and said:&#xD;
"Dol, dont be selfish. While you are crying here about your&#xD;
love's absence a mother in her cottage not only mourns his ab-&#xD;
sence, but also his broken spirit. Had we not better go and&#xD;
bring her comfort.?"..&#xD;
Mr. Fox had touched the right chord.&#xD;
"Oh father, low selfish that is in me. Come let us go at once'&#xD;
to aunt Barbara. She must not suffer a moment longer, than we,&#xD;
can hel 'it."-&#xD;
Mr. Fox nodded. They took their hats, and without stopping&#xD;
gto enlighten Mrs. Fox, who being ignorant of the whole affair,&#xD;
might well afford to remain so an hour longer, they left the house&#xD;
'and struck the direction to the cottage. Never in all his exper1&#xD;
enae had Mr. Fox been hurried over that distance at such a fright-&#xD;
ful speed. He had to stop. about a hundred feet from the gate&#xD;
to catchhis breath; but Dolores had no patience to wai&#xD;
event.- The important diary in her hand, she flew along the road,&#xD;
then through the gate, and over the porch into the hail, where&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs was just in the act of opening a door.&#xD;
"Aunt Barbara!" the girl cried with joyous rapture, and throw-&#xD;
ing her arms around the lady's neck, showered such a profusion&#xD;
of kisses, caresses and flattering appellations down uponher, that&#xD;
she could not have warded them  off, if she had been ever so much&#xD;
inclined to do so.                     t 'Doloesat iast.&#xD;
"Don't say word, before you hear me aunty, laiolores a&#xD;
exclaimed, shutting the other's lips by gently layin hr an&#xD;
upon them. "Come inI can explain it now, I can unravel the.&#xD;
mystery into the brightest sunshine."&#xD;
She drew Mrs. Fuchs into the room and then to a chair on.&#xD;
which she compelled her to sit down without much ceremony.&#xD;
Then drawing another chair to her friend's side, and also taking.&#xD;
a seat, opened her diary and said:&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
343&#xD;
&#xD;
"Here is the passage, on whose evidence you condemned me&#xD;
Read it again !"&#xD;
"Alas! I know it by heart Dolores; what is the use of reading&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"But here is the continuation of the sentence; read that then,&#xD;
if you please."&#xD;
"If Webster is correct, I worship him and worship is no love.&#xD;
Worship you can but idols. I worship the idol of my soul and&#xD;
that is idolatry.&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs stopped and Dolores looked with triumphant in-&#xD;
quiry into her face.&#xD;
"What now, aunty, mother, say, what now?"&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs looked bewildered.&#xD;
"I dont know, what to say. This is so sudden a revelation,&#xD;
that I can hardly master the powerful emotions of my heart. Oh&#xD;
Dol, if Charlie could have known this yesterday."&#xD;
"Or aunt, if I had only known, that this paper was in his pos-&#xD;
session, I. would then laid aside my pride and come to explain.&#xD;
As it was, I thought he condemned me on more trifing evidence&#xD;
and I was too proudand mortified, to take the first step in an ex-&#xD;
planation."&#xD;
"So you did not know, he had the paper? How did you happen&#xD;
to lose it?"&#xD;
"Pst', aunty, ask no question. That question might open hell&#xD;
and give its evil spirits liberty to haunt the earth. The paper&#xD;
was in my drawer-it disappeared. Let that suffice aunty. You&#xD;
understand me, don't you?"&#xD;
"I think I do, child; but this is dreadful?"&#xD;
"Never mention it again! Come, pa is on the porch; he came&#xD;
along with me, but couldn't keep steps. Let us go to him and&#xD;
advise'about the proper means, to bring back the run away."&#xD;
Mrs. Fuchs humored the girl and soon shook hands with Mr.&#xD;
Fox. She was like newly born, a very different person from what&#xD;
he had found her on his first visit. He told her so and she re-&#xD;
plied:ersanshr-&#xD;
''Nod:wonder, Sir.  Th's  -rl       -&#xD;
, S      is gil of yours is somewhat of a sor&#xD;
ceress. She understands it, to make a person laugh and cry in&#xD;
one breath. No wonder poor Charlie is so perfectly bewitched!"&#xD;
&#xD;

344                    DOLORES.&#xD;
Mr. Fox laughed and then gave the conversation a practical&#xD;
turn.&#xD;
"Let me see," he said "the next train for Boston starts at 12&#xD;
o'clock. If we dispatch Mr. Burlesque all at once, he can reach&#xD;
the depot in.time to take it. We can telegraph ot the same time&#xD;
and thus prevent our bird from fluttering any further. In that&#xD;
way we can have him here in three days at furthest. Mrs. Fuchs&#xD;
can I have your horse and buggy to take Mr. Burlesque to-town?"&#xD;
"Of course Sir's Mrs. Fuchs replied and left her friends, to get&#xD;
Henry to hitch. up the horse and drive the buggy to the front door.'&#xD;
When she returned to the porch, Mr. Fox inquired :&#xD;
"How did Charles get off so quick? The lad must have dis-&#xD;
played his usual'energy on that occasion."&#xD;
"Well Sir, his trunk was still at the depot. He had not brought&#xD;
it with him, because there was so much baggage on the train and&#xD;
he would have been obliged to wait at least an hour for it. When&#xD;
he left the mansion yesterday, he did not call here at all, but&#xD;
going to the factory, got Mr. Burlesque to drive him to the depot&#xD;
with one of the factory horses. You may imagine my feelings at&#xD;
the reception of his note. I entertained pretty hard thoughts&#xD;
about our little girl here arid came mighty near expressing them&#xD;
too."&#xD;
"Yes madam, I noticed something like it" Mr. Fox replied with&#xD;
a sarcastic twinkle of his eye "but here is the horse. Thank you&#xD;
Henry. Good bye madam, good bye Dol. You must go home&#xD;
now and inform your mother. I know she frets about you."&#xD;
"Yes father," Dolores answered, and while he drove off in one&#xD;
direction, she like a dutiful daughter returned to the mansion,&#xD;
after having said a warm good-byeto aunty Barbara.&#xD;
On reaching the factory Mr. Fox jumped from his buggy and&#xD;
entered the office. He found gloomy faces the order of the day.&#xD;
"Cheer up friends !" he cried: "there is no more occasion for&#xD;
making long faces. My little one loves your son and friend after&#xD;
all. No, she doesn't love him, she worships him, the little ;ixen!"&#xD;
Mr. Fox after giving a hurried explanation, continued: "Mr.&#xD;
Burlesque, the train for Boston leaves in one hour: can you with&#xD;
any further preparation go there and fetch -the runaway back?&#xD;
The buggy is- at the door, and I can take you to the depot." '&#xD;
Instead of an answer Mr. Burlesque jumped up and took his&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLOREs.&#xD;
&#xD;
hat. His employer had in the twinkling of an eye driven all the&#xD;
gloom fromuhis.brow.&#xD;
"I am ready, Sir!" was all he said. He was so joyous, that he&#xD;
forgot to make a joke,&#xD;
"Well Mr. Fuchs take care of yourself and the factory."&#xD;
With this warning the two left the office, jumpedinto th b&#xD;
and made the horse do-his very best. They were in time touggy&#xD;
cure the ticket, and Burlesque sprang on tue platform of th pro&#xD;
while the train was already moving.&#xD;
Mr. Fox next went to the telegraph office. He telegraphed the&#xD;
following:&#xD;
Charles Fuchs Esq.. Boston *--Hotel.&#xD;
All right!  Mystery explained.  Burlesque coming!  Await&#xD;
his coming!                                EDWARD Fox.&#xD;
Mr. Fox had done his duty. In a contented mood of mind he&#xD;
resumed his seat in the vehicle, which had brought him and re-&#xD;
turned more leisurely, than he had come.&#xD;
Three days passed away. In vain the two families had waited&#xD;
for a dispatch announcing the train on which the friends would&#xD;
arrive. At last, on the evening of the third, Mr. Burlesque arri-&#xD;
ved on foot and alone. He looked doleful and crestfallen  Mr&#xD;
and Mrs. Fox and Dolores were at the cottage in search'of news.&#xD;
All got frightened at the sad countenance of the messenger Tey&#xD;
felt distinctively, that he was the harbinger of evil tidin s&#xD;
greeted them with a nod of the head but without saying a word&#xD;
Speak man !" Mr. Fox exclaimed; "don't stand like an owl!&#xD;
we can stand the worst. Is he dead?"&#xD;
"No Sir, thank God, it isn't as bad as that. This letter no doubt&#xD;
will tell you all."&#xD;
He handed Mr. Fox a letter addressed to Mrs. Fuchs.&#xD;
"May I?" he asked, laying his finger on the seal.&#xD;
"Yes, Sir, but quick."&#xD;
Mr. Fox tore open the envelope and unfolded a note. It wasn't&#xD;
much longer than the first one Charles had written to his mother&#xD;
from the depot. It read as follows:&#xD;
Dearest Mother!&#xD;
When you get this note, I am on the ocean-.&#xD;
A scream of pain and surprise on the part of the ladies inter-&#xD;
rupted him. But it was not repeated. The suspense of what&#xD;
&#xD;
345&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7070-00000175"/>&#xD;
346                    DOLORES.&#xD;
else the note would yet reveal, took away their breath. So Mr.&#xD;
Fox continued:..&#xD;
. hardly venture to ask your forgiveness for so grievious an&#xD;
offence as mine. But Mother believe me I could not act differently.&#xD;
To return to Foxville and witness the happiness of a pair so ill-&#xD;
matched would have been worse than death and sooner or later&#xD;
would have resulted in death, his or mine. I did not know that&#xD;
any passion could so completely over power me, but it is the fact.&#xD;
My love for her has filled me so long-it was a feature of my&#xD;
boyhood-that it has pervaded my whole nature. To kill it, would&#xD;
be to kill myself. On going,  now to Europe, I do not hope to&#xD;
forget her; but I hope that I may learn in time, to bear the thought&#xD;
of knowing her the property of another, Oh! my God! of one,&#xD;
whom I most sincei'ely believe to be unworthy of her.&#xD;
At this period Mrs. Fuchs took the hand of Richard's mother.&#xD;
"Pardon him!" she said with running tears; "he knows not,&#xD;
what he says."&#xD;
Instead of an answer Mrs. Fox embraced and kissed her. Mr.&#xD;
Fox resumed:&#xD;
....I am going to Italy. 'It will give me the shadow of a con-&#xD;
solation, to visit the land, where the cradle of her ancestors was&#xD;
standing. Give my love to my dear father-she will refuse to re-&#xD;
ceive  it.  A s  so n a- a   e o t p o re s i   y m s  ifc l&#xD;

Dolores threw herself into the arms of the bereaved mother.&#xD;
They wept together-the only comfort that was left to them.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
A DECEIVER DECEIVED.&#xD;
It was a dreary life that now began in the two famnhes All&#xD;
those joyous expectations, all those anticipations of delightful&#xD;
meetings, of winter-evenings with plenty of light and warmth and&#xD;
mirth-where were they to be found? The source of light and&#xD;
life in the cottage was a wanderer in distant lands and the maiden&#xD;
in the mansion-she once so genial and happy and causing happi-&#xD;
ness to others-Dolores was only the shadow of her former self.&#xD;
We do not use the word as a mere metaphor, for not only her&#xD;
hilarity was waning---o,'the substance of her body too was wast-&#xD;
ing and those lovely forms once so round and fresh, soon assumed&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                     . 347&#xD;
an alarming angularity. Her parents studied day and night how&#xD;
to divert her ; but it was all-in' vain. She did not complain, she&#xD;
asserted in reply to all the anxious inquiries for her state of mind&#xD;
and health, that she felt well and was even comparatively happy.&#xD;
But the experienced eye of Mr. Fox could not be easily deceived&#xD;
and lie resolved to consult the family-physician before it was too&#xD;
late. In order to enable Dr. Palmer, to advise judiciously, Mr.&#xD;
Fox deemed it necessary, to give him an outline sketch of the late&#xD;
trouble, thereby enabling him to see that the disease-if such it&#xD;
was-had its seat as well in the mind as in the body.&#xD;
Dr. Palmer shook his head.&#xD;
"Medicine" "he said will not do the slightest good in this case.&#xD;
It seems, Dolores has sunk into a state of apathy, to arouse her&#xD;
from which is no easy matter, and may require extraordinary&#xD;
means. I should advise a change of place and air, in other words&#xD;
--travelling."&#xD;
"But doctor how can we travel in the depth of winter?" Mrs.&#xD;
Fox inquired. She of course had been drawn into the consulta-&#xD;
tion and now advanced this objection.&#xD;
"Well, madam, for the present you must stay at home, of course;&#xD;
but I would make plans for the coming spring and set her at work&#xD;
to think about and to prepare for it. In that wayou may give&#xD;
food to mind and body in the shape of healthful occupation.&#xD;
Only dont let her look in your cards; as soon as she thinks that&#xD;
you are doctoring her your whole project will fail."&#xD;
In obedience to these injunctions Mr. and Mrs. Fox resolved in&#xD;
their mind a dozen different plans, none of which however hacl the&#xD;
merit of particular feasibility. They were still torturing their&#xD;
brains in this manner, when all at once a ray of light burst into&#xD;
the chaos, which was as unexpected as agreeable.&#xD;
When Mr. Burlesque returned from -his last and unsuceessful&#xD;
trip-on foot, his heart and head as sore as his body, he had, be-&#xD;
tween the factory and cottage,--met a couple of idlers, whose&#xD;
comfortable look, sauntering gait and laughter contrasted too&#xD;
strongly with his gloomy mood of mind, not to fill him with an&#xD;
undefined but yet strong feeling of hostility against men, who&#xD;
were so much better off than he. When they noticed and recog.&#xD;
nized him, they thought it proper to moderate their mirth and to&#xD;
look concerned to a certain degree. The reader will already have&#xD;

<pb  n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7070-00000176"/>&#xD;
See8                   DOLORES.&#xD;
guessed, that the merry companions were nobody but Richard and&#xD;
Henry. Burlesque answered their inquiries rather sharply and&#xD;
turned away quickly, to continue his walk to the cottage; but&#xD;
rapidly as his glance passed them, he could uot help noticing a&#xD;
malignant pleasure in their eyes, nor could he help hearing an-&#xD;
other outburst- of their ugly laughter, in which they indulged a&#xD;
little too quickly from a miscalculation of time and distance.&#xD;
The stirring scenes at the cottage which now followed had the&#xD;
tendency ,of crowding this meeting from his memory for a little&#xD;
while; but when the feelings of the inmates returned to their&#xD;
wonted channel, the circumstances of that interview returned to&#xD;
his mind-with greater force than: before. , Why. should these two&#xD;
laugh at a thing, which filled the others with such deep regret?&#xD;
Did their interest vary so much from those of the rest, to account&#xD;
for such different manifestations? And if the sad misunderstand-.&#xD;
ing was so acceptable to them, was it not possible, that they had -&#xD;
helped or even planned, to bring it about?&#xD;
Mr. Burlesque was alone in his office, when this question arose&#xD;
in his mind, It agitated him to such a degree, that he jumped&#xD;
from his seat and for more than half an hour paced the floor. The&#xD;
more he thought of it, the more he followed the thread running&#xD;
through the whole tragedy, the more he became confirmed in his&#xD;
belief. Yes, these two goodfornothings had, for unknown rea-&#xD;
sons, concocted the scheme, which had chased the sunshine from&#xD;
two firesides for many a sad day, perhaps for ever. They had&#xD;
concocted it-but why ? That was the mystery. Could Richard&#xD;
really have thought, that the memory of a man like Charles could&#xD;
be so easily driven from the maiden's heart? Or was there an.-&#xD;
other secret'treason, which made him hope for success, where&#xD;
others failed to seeit"-&#xD;
Burlesque did not know; but he knew, that he might try to&#xD;
find out and he was resolved to do his best, to fathom the mys.-&#xD;
tery. If Dolores and Mr. Fox had reasons to spare thie criminals&#xD;
-if such tbey were-Mr. Burlesque had none and when he com-.&#xD;
menced his operations, he did it with the bitter resolution, to&#xD;
wage the war to the knife and to draw the culprits to shame and&#xD;
publicity, if not to the punishment their meanness merited.&#xD;
He seemed to feel, that it would not answer to make confidants&#xD;
of either of the families; but trusting to^ the resources of his&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       34g&#xD;
mind, commrenced the work without outside assistance. These&#xD;
resources were by no means despicable. His great experience in&#xD;
acting characters of the most different kinds gave him a weapon,&#xD;
which he handled with the most striking and--to the conspira-&#xD;
tors-fatal success. At first Mr. Burlesque changed his conduct&#xD;
towards Richard and Henry but little. He~ had plenty of time&#xD;
and much at steak ; their suspicion once alarmed, the efforts of&#xD;
months might not suffice to obliterate the injury occasioned by&#xD;
the injudicious movements of a minute. Only gradually and im-&#xD;
porceptible he -wormed himself into the good graces especially of&#xD;
Henry and revived his old relations to: Richard,' as the former&#xD;
was is danger of being inaccessible to any influence, which was&#xD;
antagonistic liking of the latter. Strange! without knowing it,&#xD;
Mr. Burlesque-.a second Charles-repeated a game, directed&#xD;
against a Richard, which two years before another Charles had&#xD;
played against another 'Richard at the very same place. For al-&#xD;
though, Burlesque directed his principal efforts against Henry, he&#xD;
did it merely, because he considered him an easier material to&#xD;
work upon and judged correctly, that he could reach Richard in&#xD;
that way as well and better, than if he had directed his efforts&#xD;
against him in person.&#xD;
Burlesque was a master in the art of dissembling. Guessing&#xD;
correctly that Henry disliked his brother, he thought that nothing'&#xD;
would more really engender a familiarity, than the pretention of&#xD;
a kindred feeling, especially if it was presented as the growth of&#xD;
time and in the light of confidential communications. Henry&#xD;
took the bait and before three months were over, lie had changed&#xD;
feelings towards the actor so much as to wonder, how he could&#xD;
ever have disliked him. Besides hinting at Charles as an im-&#xD;
practical fool, who didn't deserve anything better, than to wander&#xD;
over the world, Mr. Burlesque gained by nothing a quicker and&#xD;
stronger hold upon the younger brother, .than by the readiness&#xD;
with which he connived at his -little irregularities. Not satisfied&#xD;
with shieding Henry from discovery, he even lent his office and&#xD;
his money, to furnish him and Richard with the place and means,&#xD;
to indulge in those little orgies, which were totally out of quest-&#xD;
ions at either of the houses.&#xD;
At last the fruit according to his opinion was ripe enough to&#xD;
drop into his lap. We find him in the office at the late hour of&#xD;

&#xD;
8 o'clock P. M. The curtains are down; a pleasant fire in the&#xD;
grate warms up the air and a couple of lamps cast their bright&#xD;
light on awell filled supper-table. A white cloth is spread over&#xD;
the furniture, hiding its rough workmanship and several cans of&#xD;
oysters and bottles of wine promise an abundant supply of food&#xD;
and beverage. Burlesque surveys, the whole arrangement. and a&#xD;
grim smile betrays his satisfaction. He puts a case with cigars&#xD;
on the table and lighting one himself assumes a seat. before .tha&#xD;
grate, to give himself up to his thoughts. But he has not much&#xD;
time for this, for all at once a couple of voices became audible&#xD;
before the door; he hears feet knocking off the snow that covers&#xD;
all the groand outside, and then the door opens and admits our&#xD;
wellknown mariners.&#xD;
"Good evening, Burlesque !" they cries and Richard continues:&#xD;
"You have a develish cosy cabin here I tell you. Good enough&#xD;
for a prince."&#xD;
"Yes a fellow feels mighty good here after tramping through&#xD;
the snow" Henry chimed in.&#xD;
"You must be cold bdys" Burlesque said, "come to the grate&#xD;
a moment and warm yourself before you pitch in. The wine is&#xD;
a-little to cold anyhow. I just fetched it in."&#xD;
The visitors followed his injunctions and soon the trio sat. at&#xD;
the fire, engaging in a conversation, which for the sake of fair&#xD;
readers we must suppress.. Nor is it my intention to accompany&#xD;
them through their revelry. It suffices, if we notice them again&#xD;
when their tongues grow heavy and refuse to pass the ribaldry,&#xD;
which had been the order of the night. I do Mr. Burlesque&#xD;
justice, he had found no pleasure in the pastime although the tine&#xD;
was not far distant, when he had partaken in similar orgies as a&#xD;
full partner and abettor. - In this instance nothing but the love&#xD;
for his injured friend and his ardent wish to avenge his wrongs&#xD;
could have induced him to go through the sickening scene of the&#xD;
gradual intoxication of the youths.S&#xD;
Now the long looked for moment had arrived. As yet the fel-&#xD;
lows were talkative enough, ~ to babble out their secret; but&#xD;
that mark once passed, the sleepy spell would set in and then&#xD;
good bye ye revelations. So the actor commenced his operations.&#xD;
"Boys" he cried raising his tumbler, "'pears to me, we h'aint&#xD;
-.done half enough homage to the women. Our sweet hearts long&#xD;

set you a good example boys. My sweet-love lives iu Boston:,&#xD;
alas? the charming Windermere sheds her lustre now on luckier&#xD;
fellows. Well never mind this to her memory lads, come pledge&#xD;
a glass." The visitors were not slow to join him in the toast and&#xD;
the glasses soundedmerrily amongst the shouts.&#xD;
"So" Burlesque resumed. "I've done my duty now. Henry&#xD;
your turn comes next."&#xD;
"Lucy Fox then?" the young man stammered forth, "her health&#xD;
for ever. !"&#xD;
Again the glasses met with a zest that threatened their im-&#xD;
mediate destruction.&#xD;
"Ah ! does the wind blow from that corner, Henry? Your taste&#xD;
is good and.your judgment better. A cunning rooster always&#xD;
hunts for a warmly lined.nest. Now you, Richard, give us the&#xD;
last but not the least toast. I'm sure you can have picked no&#xD;
unworthy subject for your love!"&#xD;
"I should think not" he answered strutting like a turkey gob-&#xD;
bler, "what would you say, if I pledged you for'-Dolores, duchess&#xD;
of Gatana?"&#xD;
"Good, Sir, good upon my soul. I wish that milk-sop of a&#xD;
Charlie could hear you now. The fool! So run away and leave&#xD;
his sweetheart to his betters. Ha! ha !"&#xD;
"Ha! ha! It's surely funny; but Burlesque you know he would&#xD;
not have run quite so quick, if I and Henry here hadn't signed his&#xD;
passes. But you havn't pledged me yet: long life to the duchess&#xD;
of Gatana !"&#xD;
"Here I go" Burlespue answered, "and I most sincerely wish&#xD;
her chances for the title were as great as her beauty."&#xD;
"Never you mind, Sir" Richard popped out, "that title is a&#xD;
deuced sight better, than you think. Do you imagine, I should&#xD;
-allow myself to be captivated by !a handsome phiz, if it wasn't&#xD;
backed by a ducal crown and plenty of fields and villages ? Heh!&#xD;
Henry! it takes a man to see the world to make him clever-&#xD;
doesn't it old fellow?"&#xD;
"To be sure it does Dick. You and I have our share."&#xD;
"There! Burlesque: do you hear that ? Just come and pledge&#xD;
a glass to Richard, duke of Gatana and his consort."&#xD;
"I will, with pleasure Richard;- yes more- than that: I'il pledge&#xD;

the moon; which, in truth, I fear it isa't."&#xD;
"Isn't, eh? See here old chap, if you weren't so clever, a fellow,&#xD;
I'd say, you were a damned sort of an unbelieving Thomas. What&#xD;
do you mean Charlie, to doubt the word of a gentleman, like me?"&#xD;
Burlesque took it all in good humor. It didn't suit him, to get&#xD;
angry. Laughing at the other's pompous air, he cried:&#xD;
"So far Richard, I havn't had a chance to doubt your word.&#xD;
You have been joking and- I have given joke for joke. In reality,&#xD;
I guess, I have about as much chance to be a duke as you."&#xD;
"You have? have you? Supposing we take the thing from a-&#xD;
practical point of view: are you willing to bet $5.00 on that?"&#xD;
"Of course, I will and win it too. Henry may hold stakes;&#xD;
here is my five-fork.out your money."&#xD;
"The devil take me, if I have any; supposing you lend me&#xD;
some; when I am duke, I'll pay you back with interest."&#xD;
That's cool!" Burlesque said with laugh, "but I have no ob-&#xD;
jection to that novel way of betting. Here Henry is another five&#xD;
and now Richard, if you can prove the point, the stake is yours."&#xD;
Richard laughed the coarse laugh, peculiar to intoxicated&#xD;
persons.&#xD;
"That money is as good as mine" he cried. "I hope you'll ad-&#xD;
mnit Henry's testimony."&#xD;
"If he promises to adhere strictly to veracity."&#xD;
"Honor bright!" cries Henry.&#xD;
"All right then! Go ahead Steamboat!",&#xD;
"Very well" said Richard' interrupting the following narrative&#xD;
with the drunken man's hiccoughs and numerous attempts, to&#xD;
moisten his tongue, all of which interruptions will be left out for&#xD;
the benefit of the reader. "Very well Sir, I can satify you in less&#xD;
than no time. ' This summer, you must know, our' vessel put in&#xD;
at Leghorn, to take in a cargo of goods-was that so Henry?"&#xD;
"Just so.".&#xD;
'-Well, after a hard day's work the Captain would often give us&#xD;
men permission, to go to shore. Henry and I of course improved&#xD;
such opportunities, for I tell you Burlesque that country beats all&#xD;
the world for its wines and girls-don't it Henry?"&#xD;
"I think, it does."&#xD;
"One night we had loaded so mnuch,e that we couldn't get back&#xD;

"So we went. Leaving the city behind us, we struck a road&#xD;
that winds through the hills to the interior, rising hi r and&#xD;
higher and affording thousand beautiful views on the by and the&#xD;
city;at our feet. To tell the truth, Burlesque we didn't care much&#xD;
about the picturesque, Henry and I. Wqe wet din' re much&#xD;
and I tell you we got enough of it, before we etune  e so&#xD;

we said good bye to them and climbed until we reached the top&#xD;
of the mountain that girdles the coast. T e  read the&#xD;
us hungry and tired; therefore we were glad to discover an old&#xD;
castle at the roadside, built in old style t dis  a nts&#xD;

best we had drunk so far. It made us talkative and since the&#xD;
eastellan understood french and we had picked up a smattering&#xD;
of that language in-the french ports, -we succeeded first rate, in&#xD;
keeping up a conversation. We asked him questions about this&#xD;
and that and somehow or other-I hardly knew how it came up-&#xD;
he told us the name of his master, the owner of the castle. It&#xD;
was the duke di Gatan a."&#xD;
"The dickens it was !" Burlesque broke out with sudden vehe-&#xD;
mence-he had forgotten his role. Fortunately the vigorous ex-&#xD;
pression suited the occasion; at least Richard took it in good&#xD;
humor.&#xD;
"Aha! you begin to smell a rat, do you?" he said laughing-&#xD;
"Henry hold on to the stakes the old chap is fearing for his&#xD;
money."&#xD;
"It  gins to look squally !" Burlesque replied scratching his&#xD;
ears and looking concerned. "But go on with your yarn-the&#xD;
sooner I know my fate, the better."&#xD;
"You can be accommodated my dear Sir; tho' as to the money&#xD;
-you better make up your mind at once to loose it-it's' a gone&#xD;
case."&#xD;
"I'll see about that, when you have done. So go on."&#xD;
-'Very well. I started when I heard the name and so did Henry.&#xD;
We did start Henry, didn,t we?"&#xD;
"Guess we did.,'&#xD;
"The duke di Gatana?" says I to the castellan. "I thought the&#xD;
estates of the duke had been confiscated by the government?"&#xD;
"That was under the Austrian government in Lombardy, where&#xD;
most domains are lying" says he, "but this war has changed all&#xD;
that. We belong to Italy now, the possessions have been restored,&#xD;
to the rightful owner."&#xD;
"The devil they have! thinks I" may be the little beggar-girl at&#xD;
home is worth looking after.&#xD;
"But who is the rightful owner, Sir?". says I to the castellan.&#xD;
"I thought the duke had been obliged to flee for his life and never&#xD;
returned to his native country ?"        .     s    .&#xD;
"You have been rightly informed," says the old man 'with. a&#xD;
sigh; "it is a sad story Sir, and brings the tears into my old eyes."&#xD;
"Have you any objection to telling us?"&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       355&#xD;
He had none and we now listened to a well-known story. Of&#xD;
course, what we knew already, hadn't much interest for us, but&#xD;
we learned other things that were well worth the time we spent&#xD;
on thexi. When he had finished I asked hiui:&#xD;
"So the present Duke is the brother of the one who had to&#xD;
leave the country ?"&#xD;
"Yes Signor."&#xD;
"And you never learned from him again?"&#xD;
"No Sir, we didn't. To tell you in confidence, the present&#xD;
Duke idn't over-exert himself in finding him. It was his inter-&#xD;
est, his brother shouldn't be found and interest you know, goes&#xD;
above: blood. But then it isn't my business-what has a poor&#xD;
od man to do with such affairs?"&#xD;
"Then if the real Duke was still alive, the&#xD;
back to him?"                   aie h property would go&#xD;
"No doubt, Sir."&#xD;
"Or to his son, in case of his death?" -&#xD;
"Why certainly, Signor, that's the law of the country."&#xD;
Now for a question more to the point, thinks I."&#xD;
"Signor Castellano, you are very kind to answer the idle ques-&#xD;
tions of a stranger; yet I must ask one more: how would the&#xD;
case stand, provided a daughter had been left instead of a son?"&#xD;
"Of that Signor, I can inform you correctly," says he; "because&#xD;
e archives of the family have a similar case on record."&#xD;
"And that record--what does it say?"&#xD;
"It gave the property to the daughter and the title to the uncle."&#xD;
Then the daughter was not a duchess?"&#xD;
"No, but she married, and the king graciously bestowed the&#xD;
ucal dignity upon the pair."&#xD;
"Then the husband of Dolores may also get that title?'' says I.&#xD;
e old man jumped up as if he had been a man of twenty, in-&#xD;
stead of carrying sixty on his back.&#xD;
"Dolores!" he cried ; "what do you know about her? You lww&#xD;
her name, you know her residence-oh make the last daysof;fan&#xD;
old man happy by letting him partake of your knowledge&#xD;
I had made a blunder--the smartest of us can makehlers;&#xD;
-can't they, Burlesque?"&#xD;
"Of course," the actor responded and there is reasawtQ, be1ievel&#xD;
tt he said, what he meant.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7070-00000180"/>&#xD;
356&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORS.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, I had made a blunder, but I am not the fellow, that re-&#xD;
mains sticking in the lurch as easily as that.  So I says as un-&#xD;
concerned as possible:&#xD;
"What do you mean Signor? I know of no 'Dolores'; only you&#xD;
mentioned that name before in speaking of the Duke's laughter,&#xD;
and I had recollected it."&#xD;
The old chap laid his hand on his forehead. He seemed deeply&#xD;
pained by his disappointment and, upon honor, I felt for the fel-&#xD;
low, as I owed him some valuable information. But then,'you&#xD;
know, I couldn't let him look in my cards. That would have&#xD;
been absurd-wouldn't it?"&#xD;
Burlesque of course agreed.&#xD;
"I knew you'd say so. But that's my besetting weakness., I&#xD;
am tender-hearted as a chicken-if I wasn't, I'd fare a great deal&#xD;
better. But see here Henry, just fork over that money of yours."&#xD;
"I protest!" Burlesque cried, laughing against his will. "On&#xD;
what grounds do you claim it?"&#xD;
Richard looked indignant.&#xD;
"There now!" he cried; "that's just like you. You are the most&#xD;
selfish old coon I ever saw. You were so in Boston, You are so&#xD;
now, you'll ever be so. What? protest against my pocketing this&#xD;
'well-earned money?"&#xD;
"How well-earned, Richard ?"&#xD;
"Burlesque, you mean dog! didn't I tell you a nice story?"&#xD;
"Agreed!"&#xD;
"Didn't 3 ou and I bet abgut something?"&#xD;
"Agreed !"&#xD;
"Henry, what was it about?"&#xD;
"Damned if I know!"&#xD;
Henry was very drowsy.&#xD;
"That's a pity! But see here, 'tis all the same thing. I know,&#xD;
I won and that ought to be enough between gentlemen."&#xD;
"Well, I don't care, you may pocket the stakes; bnt you must&#xD;
finish the story.''&#xD;
"If that's all here it goes."&#xD;
But the tongue of the young toper had by this time become so&#xD;
beavy, that Burlesque could make very little out of his words.&#xD;
Nor did he care. He knew enough and allowing the two revel-&#xD;
lers to sleep themselves sober on the floor of the office- to which&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
the law of gravity naturally attracted them, he blew out the lamp&#xD;
and taking for his part the comfortable rocking-chair, studied o&#xD;
the startling revelations of his former friend and boon compan-&#xD;
ion, until his eyes also became heavy and he fell asleep-&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX VII.&#xD;
THE "GREAT TOUR."&#xD;
Burlesque wanted to awake in time, to send his companions&#xD;
home and remove the traces of their opgies, before daylight and&#xD;
with it the arriving workmen would notice such disordcrs-and&#xD;
he did awakb. It was not easy to rouse the others from their le-&#xD;
thargic condition; but a few well-directed kicks and blows finally&#xD;
answered the purpose and they rose from the floor, stiff from their&#xD;
uncomfortable quarters and dirty like swine, that have wallowad&#xD;
he mud. Their humor wasn't the very best, and instead of&#xD;
taking the stiffness of their joints and the pain in their heads as&#xD;
a very moderate punishment for their excesses, they swore and&#xD;
cursed as if thereby they could improve their condition. Bur-&#xD;
lesque however did not stand on ceremony that morning, after&#xD;
having somewhat brushed their soiled clothes, he opened the door&#xD;
acdgave them to understand that it would be in their interest to&#xD;
reach their beds as soon as possible, in order to sleep away the&#xD;
most striking traces of las  ight's irregularities. They were&#xD;
now sober.enough, to see tl propriety of this advice and acting&#xD;
upon it withdrew from the premises. Burlesque looked after them&#xD;
with contempt.&#xD;
"Go !" he said with a scornful motion of his hand; "I have&#xD;
what I want and now throw you away like the lemon from which&#xD;
the juice is pressed. Go, if there was anything of a redeeming&#xD;
character in you, I might pity. But no you don't deserve even&#xD;
Pity-you are fit subjects of contempt."&#xD;
Burlesque followed them at break of day. He found Mis.Fachs&#xD;
stirring. 'From her looks he saw that she was aware of. his ab-&#xD;
sence as well as that of Henry; but before she could put in words&#xD;
the indignation.filling her, he took her hand and said-'&#xD;
"Mother Barbara, don't scold ; for I do not deserve it. Don't&#xD;
&#xD;
U l&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7070-00000181"/>&#xD;
ask questions either and be satisfied, if I tell you that oneCharlie&#xD;
is working for the other."&#xD;
After those words he nodded and sought his room. There&#xD;
he .remained long enough to wash and dress and leaving the&#xD;
house, took the road leading to the mansion, It was very early&#xD;
-when he got there and Mr. Fox, to whom he was announced won-&#xD;
dered what so unusual a visit could signify. Yet he admitted his&#xD;
superintendent and remained closeted with him so long, that the&#xD;
servants had to ring the breakfast-bell half a dozen times with-&#xD;
out his minding it. He accompanied Mr. Burlesque through the&#xD;
garden to the very gate talking to him 'in such an eager manner,&#xD;
that Susan and Co. racked their brains to know what in the world&#xD;
such intimacy could mean. But Mr. Fox was deaf to all hints.&#xD;
and inquiries on the part of servants as well, as inembers of the&#xD;
family. After breakfast he went to the cottage, from the cottage&#xD;
to the factory; from the factory to the mansion, and yet he merely&#xD;
seemed to have'reached the latter place, for the purpose of mak-&#xD;
ing the same identical tour over again.S&#xD;
At dinner increasd curiosity on ths part of the ladies- impe-&#xD;
netrable smiles on the part of Mr. Fox. Only at supper that gen-&#xD;
tleman vouchsafed a gracious explanation of his bustle. .&#xD;
"My dear" he said bowing to Mrs. Fox, "Children I have the&#xD;
pleasure to announce to you, that on the first of March coming&#xD;
we are going to start on the great tour. I have received informa-&#xD;
tion of a business character, which makes my presence' in France&#xD;
and Italy unavoidable. We have bg  talking so long about this&#xD;
trip, that you may as well accompany me, for-to tell the honest&#xD;
truth-I hate to measure all the omnibusses, railroad-cars and&#xD;
steamboat-cabins of Europe 'alone. What do you think of my&#xD;
proposal? What do you think of the prospect of visiting the&#xD;
land of ancient lore, the Rhine, the Rhone and the Po, the Arno&#xD;
and the Tiber?,,"&#xD;
On the pale cheek of Dolores a faint color made its appearance,&#xD;
the first time for ever so long. It didn't stay long either as if it&#xD;
was itself frightened at its own boldness. But Mr. Fox had seen&#xD;
it and Mrs. Fox had seen it and the latter, glad at her husband's&#xD;
announcement on her own accord, was doubly gladonhperceiving&#xD;
the animating influence, which the mere thought of the trip had&#xD;
,on her darling. She entered with a lively spirit into his prop&#xD;

sition and spoke with so much enthusiasm of the pleasure she&#xD;
anticipated, that Dolores found it' impossible to harbor for a mop&#xD;
mnent the idea, that the whole affair was merely a novel dose of&#xD;
medicine for her debilitated system.&#xD;
"And we are to start on the first of March?" Mrs. Fox resumed&#xD;
for the twentieth time, "dear me, children what a short time, to&#xD;
get our wardrobes all arranged. We cannot go without due pre-&#xD;
paration and I may as well, tell our worthy husband and father,&#xD;
that a deep grip into the purse will be necessary to procure the&#xD;
.necessary outfit,"&#xD;
"I give you carte blanche" Mr. Fox said with a grace, which&#xD;
alas! adorns but few fathers and husbands and a more becoming&#xD;
ornament, than which no lady wishes, in her husband or father.&#xD;
Nor did the ladies in the mansion fail to appreciate such noble&#xD;
generosity and after a long and animated discussion in which&#xD;
even Dolores showed a more lively interest than usual, it was re-&#xD;
solved, that two of their number should make a trip to Boston'in&#xD;
the company and under the protection of Mr. Burlesque, who,&#xD;
they correctly thought would be apt, to show them the best&#xD;
-sources for procuring the various articles they needed.&#xD;
Mrs. Fox of course was to form one of the two delegates, as&#xD;
her experience on the realm of fashion could not possibly be&#xD;
spared. But who was to accompany her? Both girls could not&#xD;
well go away, as they could not think of leaving so generous a&#xD;
father immediately after his manifestation of munificence. True,&#xD;
de volunteered to stand the tortures of single blessedness&#xD;
for a week or so, but they would not think of accepting his&#xD;
:sacrifice and the problem was therefore reduced to the question,&#xD;
which of the two girls was to stay at home? They rivalled iii&#xD;
generous offers;. but for a while it was doubtlul who was to carry&#xD;
.off the palm. At last however Lucy taking her sisters hand&#xD;
looked in her eye with an imploring tearfool look, saying:&#xD;
"Dear Dolores, for my sake, go!"'&#xD;
Dolores was so astonished at this sudden manifestation of re-&#xD;
turning affection, that for a moment she could do nothing but&#xD;
stare at the other with mute surprise. Then however recovering&#xD;
from her wonderment she yielded to' the impulse of joy, which&#xD;
seized her .and throwing 'her arms around Lucy's neck, she said :&#xD;

"Anything you please, Lucy. It makes me happy to accommo-&#xD;
date you."&#xD;
The parents looked on with pleasure, but they did not under-&#xD;
stand, why so ordinary an event should be made the occasion for&#xD;
a solemn demonstration.&#xD;
The reader however does understand. In Lucy's mind the un-&#xD;
happy issue of her brother's intrigue had aroused the most bitter-&#xD;
remorse. As long as Dolores stood in the bloom of health and&#xD;
pride and strength she had succeeded in hardening her heart&#xD;
against her. But when the arrow had left the shaft; when it had_&#xD;
penetrated to her heart and caused the poor girl to wilt like a&#xD;
flower, at whose root a worm is gnawing,-then at once Lucy,&#xD;
awoke from her trance. Even her slighted love, and a jealousy&#xD;
so natural under the circumstances could not induce her to rejoice&#xD;
at the sudden and fatal change -in Dolores' appearance. The&#xD;
thought that this lingering wasting fever would result in con-&#xD;
sumption and that in such an instance she might justly ascribe to&#xD;
her agency the principal cause of her rivals terrible death.&#xD;
But tho' these thoughts had been agitating her soul ever sinca-&#xD;
the fatal Sunday, she had managed to hide every trace of her&#xD;
emotions from Dolores; so that when her conversion broke through&#xD;
the cover with the suddenness of a wildfire, the patient could&#xD;
hardly be blamed for showing such little preparation. At all&#xD;
events she quickly understood the motives of Lucy and helping&#xD;
her to glide over the next hours with her wonted good tact, she&#xD;
managed not only to keep their parents in ignorance of the true&#xD;
state of affairs, but also to let the resumption of their former&#xD;
friendly relation appear so much the matter of course, that they&#xD;
soon ceased to wonder.&#xD;
The trip to Boston was made, and such a great stock of the&#xD;
most exquisite tissues of silk, wool and cotton, was brought back&#xD;
that all the seamstresses of Foxville were kept busy day and&#xD;
night, to sew the numerous articles of dress, which were to be.&#xD;
finished before the first of March.&#xD;
It was' indeed a busy time. Mr. Fuchs and Miss. Sarah Good-&#xD;
man of course were not only consulted but even engaged for that&#xD;
matter. Dolores' was greatly benefited by this bustle. She had&#xD;
no time, and no place to pine and this healthy, unceasing work&#xD;
around her gave a healthy tone to her weakened frame. True,.&#xD;

she was yet far from regaining that former elasticity of mind and&#xD;
body, which had, been her principal charm; but the feeble glow&#xD;
on her cheek became less shy,. and at last suffered itself to be&#xD;
fastened there permanently.&#xD;
Richard was the only one in the family, who did not share in&#xD;
the-bustle or in the hilarity thereby awakened. Mr. Fox, although&#xD;
he had promised Dolores to forget certain under-currents of in-&#xD;
trigue, which had produced this deplorable condition of affairs,&#xD;
found it a more difficult task, than he had imagined. At first he&#xD;
had pondered a good deal on the matter and..received a tolerably&#xD;
clear impression of the part, which both his children had played&#xD;
in the tragedy. But while he blamed Lucy for abetting, he con-&#xD;
demned Richard for plotting and in spite of all efforts he could&#xD;
not force himself to more than an indifference towards the youno-&#xD;
man. Even Mrs. Fox seemed to have an indistinct perception of&#xD;
his perfidy and treated him less warmly than before and so lie&#xD;
reaped in rich profusion, what he had sown with such great e-&#xD;
pectations. His accomplice in the house--Lucy-shrank from&#xD;
him because she knew his wicked intentions more fully than the&#xD;
others and the company of the other-Henry-was no great&#xD;
scource of satisfaction. On the.one hand the inmates of the cot-&#xD;
tage showed too plainly how unacceptable his visits were to them,&#xD;
on the other no real pleasure can ever spring from friendship.&#xD;
based on sin, Such amusement is like the counterfeit light of the-&#xD;
moon; it shines, but, there is no warmth, no animating clement,&#xD;
within it.&#xD;
Dolores-she, whom he had so deeply injured-was the only&#xD;
person, who  now showed him kindness. At meals, at night, while&#xD;
gathered round the fireside, she spoke to him and tried to draw-&#xD;
him into the general conversation. But these efforts, so well&#xD;
meant, had the opposite effect from that intended. Richard's na-&#xD;
ture though depraved had retained sufficient elements of good-&#xD;
niess, to be impressed and troubled by these manifestations of&#xD;
generosity. Instead of benefiting by her kind advances, he shrank&#xD;
from her touch, as if her hand.had been burning fire. There was&#xD;
a great upheaving in his inmost being-hewent as it were, through&#xD;
the process of fermentation. As yet the :drege were not th-rown&#xD;
out-wildly the conflicting elements of his nature raged within&#xD;
his heart, and no one could tell, which wo'ld gain the victory.&#xD;

Indeed nobody knew and even on the approachof March, whey&#xD;
the struggle was over, when the lees had settled and the heart of&#xD;
the young man issued purified from the fearful struggle--nobody&#xD;
in the house had any idea of his change. Nor did he tell. tem&#xD;
he feared nobody would credit his professions, andon his depar-&#xD;
ture to his vessel which fell in the week before that of the others&#xD;
he took with himthe indifference of his family as a merited pun-&#xD;
ishment for his deeds. Yet he was not hopeless. Through all&#xD;
the tedious hours of his monotonous calling, he took the pleas-&#xD;
ant anticipation, of a joyful reception after a long and earnest&#xD;
probation.&#xD;
A lively scene preceded the departure of the family. Business&#xD;
had nothing to do with it, for Mr. Fuchs and Burlesque had long&#xD;
before that time received full instructions and authority. But all&#xD;
the neighbors came and said good bye; the inmates of the cot-&#xD;
tage and the parsonage of course in the front ranks. Now the&#xD;
popularity of the family could be plainly seen. If this tour had&#xD;
been undertakenbefore Mrs. Fox' sickness, the demonstrations&#xD;
might not have been so numerous and so lively; but since that&#xD;
time the changed conduct of that ladyhad gained her a love and&#xD;
respect as warm as that accorded to her husband. The principal&#xD;
share however fell on Dolores, who was the idol of the village. If&#xD;
I have-omitted to report the many acts of Samaritan kindness by&#xD;
-which she had endeavored herself to the hearts of the people, the&#xD;
readers must blame the narrow scope of this tale and not my dis-&#xD;
position. They may be sure that such acts were ex eedingly n-&#xD;
-,nerous and the fact that the villagers re'collectcd them after the&#xD;
young lady's protracted absence at school, is an el.oquent testi1&#xD;
mony in itself. During the late winter the poor child had not&#xD;
been seen much; but the people did not blame her. They rather&#xD;
pitied her and loved her the more for her distress. Somehow or&#xD;
-other a rumor had spread through the place-it seems that peo-&#xD;
ple have an intuitive perception by which they reach conclusions&#xD;
-and that rumor was not far from the truth. Dolores and Charles&#xD;
figured in these reports as hero and heroine, and Richard as the&#xD;
*ogre, who by his wicked charms separated the lovers. Indeed the&#xD;
young man was made to feel the aversion of the people all winter&#xD;
and to the moment of his departure public sentiment condemned,&#xD;
him by word, look and gesture. In large towns individual mi-&#xD;

-quity disappears in general the turmoil or is neutralized by rank,&#xD;
wealth or other influences; but although flattery and adulation&#xD;
live in villages as well as cities, the vox populi is there generally&#xD;
ess biased by outside circumstances.&#xD;
At last the day arrived, on which the family of the mansion&#xD;
were to leave. They were glad, when the last hand was shaken&#xD;
the last adieu spoken, and the carriage took them from their home&#xD;
to the depot. Nothing is mord worrying than this incessant leave-&#xD;
taking, and however well the good.speeds of our friends may be&#xD;
meant, they can under circumstances annoy us as much as the&#xD;
maledictions of our enemies.&#xD;
The depot is reached, the seats are taken, the train rushes them&#xD;
to Boston, and in the harbor the "Sea-serpent" opened its hospi,&#xD;
table quarters to the party. Staterooms having been secured be-&#xD;
forehand, all necessary arrangements were completed without loss&#xD;
of time, and the next morning, when the steamer began to drive&#xD;
her mighty paddles through the water of the harbor, our friends&#xD;
were on the deck enjoying the beautiful eurroundings and anti-&#xD;
cipating even greater pleasures from the future. Nor were they&#xD;
disappointed. Excepting a few squally days, on which sea-sick-&#xD;
ness knocked of the cabin-door of some of the passangers they&#xD;
were favored with the fairest weather and the nearer they came&#xD;
to the coast of Europe, the more marked became also the approach&#xD;
of spring. We cannot afford to accompany the family on their&#xD;
tour, cannot examine with then the great cities 'of England and&#xD;
France, nor follow all.their steps along the romantic Rhine. Suf,&#xD;
flice it to say, that having reached Switzerland they ascended&#xD;
higher and-higher, reaching the famous peaks where snow is never&#xD;
melting, and thence descended into the classic vallies of Italy.&#xD;
The whole company had' longed for that moment with a rest-&#xD;
lessness, of which they themselves were probably ignorant; but&#xD;
which had surely existed and in a measure deprived them of the&#xD;
pleasure, which otherwise they might have found in viewing so&#xD;
many beauties of nature, so many specimens of science art and&#xD;
industry. But once in, Italy their movements began to be more&#xD;
measured and having reached the Lago di Como, Mr. Fox rented&#xD;
an old villa which was sufficiently well furnished, to permit a so-&#xD;
journ in the fair season. The house lay On the fake shore, hav-&#xD;
ing a magnificent view on the greater portion of the crystal sheet&#xD;

that washed the base of the rock, on which it was built. At first&#xD;
the family missed the comfort of their home; for the nobleman in&#xD;
Italy lives and furnishes his house often more plainly than the&#xD;
American mechanic in moderate circumstances. No doubt the&#xD;
villa which .they had rented, had once been inhabited by .one of&#xD;
these nobles such as the-country even now abounds with, like our&#xD;
forests swarm with locusts in years particularly favorable to the&#xD;
development of those insects ; but the race-had died out long ago,.&#xD;
or by some cause ar other been driven from the home of their an&#xD;
cestors.--At all events, when the Fox' rented the place at an al-&#xD;
most nominal rate, they found it, what in Foxville would have&#xD;
been termed, out of repair. The windows had not only lost their.&#xD;
shutters or jalousiess" as the French call them so properly, but&#xD;
many of their panes in the bargain and when Mr. Fox called the&#xD;
landlord's attention; to their defective condition, he received the&#xD;
information, that this circumstance was rather an advantage as&#xD;
the draft produced would mitigate the heat. The balance of the&#xD;
house was in keeping with the windows, i. e. in the landlord's con&#xD;
struction in excellent trim. For every defect he found an excuse,&#xD;
actually turning it into a merit, so that on his departure Mr. Fox&#xD;
could not. help feeling proud of his new habitation. Dolores&#xD;
laughed at him, and that heartily, the first time for a long, long&#xD;
time, and so pleased was her father at hearing this long missed-&#xD;
music, that he declared himself greatly indebted to the landlord&#xD;
and willing to undergo a second trial of his patience with even&#xD;
greater meekness, provided Dolores would .re ward him in a similar&#xD;
manner Our young friend had at once become of even greater&#xD;
consequence in the house, than at home; for she alone was en-&#xD;
abled by her knowledge of the native- tongue, to interpret the&#xD;
wishes of the others to the numerous servants. Numerous tin-&#xD;
deed ! Mr. Fox had engaged a host of them just for fun. There&#xD;
was the buttler and the stewart and the master of ceremonies and&#xD;
the porter and the male and female cook and a half a dozen.&#xD;
waiters and the coachman and a half a dozen house-maids and&#xD;
dear knows what else. The first memorandum of Mr. Fox dated&#xD;
from Lago di Como reads as follows:&#xD;
Engaged twenty-one servants to-day. Amountof total wages&#xD;
equal to those of John, Jim and Susan at home. Was afraid to&#xD;
have my ears eaten off at first, but they tell me, these fellows live&#xD;

more. It sounds kind of big, when I write, to the folks at home.&#xD;
"We keep house now, with only three dozen servants."&#xD;
But Mr. Fox wasn't through yet with his experience. Just you&#xD;
wait a little while, my good friend and you will talk in a differ-&#xD;

Mr. Fox did not make great pretentious to style an,d clearness&#xD;
in his diary ; therefore we must be cautious, not to treatour read-&#xD;

has resumed a habit she forme&amp;amp;,at school and if she succeeded so&#xD;

Indeed no woman ever fared as badly as I! no woman ever was&#xD;
required to cry to the four points of the compass: come loved&#xD;
one! here I am. I love you, please requite my passion! That is&#xD;
the world upside-down, the wooer wooed.&#xD;
Now there! castles in Spain again! I trouble myself about&#xD;
what may come and forget that the chances are in favor of noth-&#xD;
%happening at all. True Mr. Ftchs has written to the various&#xD;
American Consuls in the Italian cities and as every person has&#xD;
to show his passe here, our agents may get a trace of the deserter.&#xD;
But they may not for -that matter and just as. propably too, and&#xD;
then? A blind travelling here and there, a chance crossing or di-&#xD;

from him. That is not very flattering for myself; it rather hn-&#xD;
-   -ilites me; it dissolves to vapor that praise, which insisted on&#xD;

face. In the morning when I wako up and in the night, when I&#xD;

his sight. Alas, not yet... .&#xD;

customss of my people; but I remember their language and now&#xD;
whenoIsmove amongst our servants or the inhabitants of the sur-&#xD;

one would listen to distant bells, carrying a well-known air sweetly&#xD;
bindistinctly through the air....&#xD;
.but  We have a     -ost ef servants and yet hardly any at all. I-&#xD;
tlah at father for making that very same remark.&#xD;
to ldo not know, how it is, Caroline," he said to mother this.&#xD;
morning with a perplexed mien; "with all our help we are more&#xD;
poorly served than at home."&#xD;
"But I know why father," I cried, when ma did not reply.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Let's hear then, Dol."&#xD;
"The reason is, that we havn't all these servants but they sus-&#xD;
tain that relation to one another. You recollect the story of, the&#xD;
house that ,Jack built?"      .&#xD;
"No child, I don't think that I do."&#xD;
"What pa! not know the story of the "morn ad the prist al'&#xD;
tattered and torn, that married the maid, that milked the cow&#xD;
with the crumpled horn....&#xD;
"Enough, Dol !" he cried with a laugh. "I know now, and&#xD;
shouldn't wonder if you were right. But I'll be hanged if I hu-&#xD;

Pa went out in a rage and I was highly amused when he con-&#xD;
voked his host of servants, paid them their wages a week in ad&#xD;
vanes and then told one half of them, that he would dispense with&#xD;
their services. They all understood the. first part of the speech&#xD;
first rate; but when it came to the second, papa Fox had to&#xD;
secure my assistance, to convince these obtuse fellows of the fact&#xD;
that i future we should be able to get along without their valu-&#xD;
able help. I made them understand however; but such crying&#xD;
and lamenting! such promises of doing better, such, invocations&#xD;
of all the saints and higher powers that our cruelty would deprive&#xD;
a dozen children of a chance of living! Fortunately Mr. Fox re-&#xD;
ceived these lamentations through my mouth, else the dear good&#xD;
gentleman would have been shaken in his purpose in less than no&#xD;
time. But I becoming stern for once, bade them begone and that&#xD;
without delay.&#xD;

America. a girl in the beginnin' of her teens would be ashamed&#xD;

step this very moment into my -presence. I can hardly explain&#xD;
the nature.of my feeling; but it seems to me as if I see him with&#xD;

him, leading him nearer and nearer, until at last he stands ii the&#xD;
presence of' his happy Dolores......&#xD;
This morning father is going to leave us for a while. He&#xD;
is going to make a trip to Turin, on business he says with a mys-&#xD;
terious mien in answer to our inquiries. We wanted him to take&#xD;
us along, just to ,tease him; but no! he cannot make any use of a&#xD;
lot of troublesome women on a business excursion, he says. Be-&#xD;
sides he thinks we ought to rest a little, and keep the goodforno-&#xD;
thing ragamuffins in a wholesome perspiration. They are just&#xD;
learning to shift their feet he says and he wouldn't for the world&#xD;
go through the process of training them again. There is enough&#xD;
remaining to be done in that line heaven knows "he complains"&#xD;
to make the thought of recommencing perfectly preposterous.&#xD;
So we of course submit with a good grace, but then, being&#xD;
women, we rack our brains in order to conceive, what business he&#xD;
possibly can have in Turin. He looked at me wtth a much mean-&#xD;
ing glance-can he possibly intend to make inquiries-concerning&#xD;
my relations?&#xD;
. . . .Father has gone and I made use of my increased leisure&#xD;
this afternoon to make an excursion along the lake shore in com-&#xD;
pany of Antonio, our servant. I wanted Lucy to go along; but&#xD;
she excused herself with the plea of being busy. I think she&#xD;
told a little fib though-Miss Lucy shares the aversion of most&#xD;
her country-women to using their feet more than is necessary. If&#xD;
we could have taken the carriage, she would' have gone along.&#xD;
But no indeed, when I take an airing, I dont want the horses and&#xD;
the coachman to share the fun. -I should have left Antonio at&#xD;
home, if it had not been for the many vagabonds, that loiter about.&#xD;
The war they say, has largely increased their number and that it&#xD;
is -unsafe for a lady to go without protection. Mother insisted&#xD;
on Antonio's going and to keep from alarming her, I yielded and&#xD;
departed without discussing the question:is Antonio any protec-&#xD;
ti ion ?&#xD;
The, walk was beauliful; we followed the winding lake shore&#xD;
and even now I revel in the recollection of so many charms. We&#xD;

must have been four miles from home and that was, farther, than&#xD;
I intended to go; but then one new point of beauty chased the&#xD;
other, alluring me on and further on, so that at last it required a&#xD;
firm resolution, to turn my head and retrace my steps. The lat-&#xD;
ter expression is hardly correct tho'; Antonio told me of an-&#xD;
other road, higher up the hills, that would take us home and al-&#xD;
low more extensive views of the lake and the distant shore be-&#xD;
yond. Of course, I told him, to lead me on to it, and in conse-&#xD;
quence had two adventures, ore pleasant and the other rather less&#xD;
so. After we had climbed a path winding up the hill-side, we&#xD;
reached the new road and indeed were amply paid for our trouble.&#xD;
The views lost the charming details of those on the lower road,&#xD;
but they more than compensated by their grandeur and expanse.&#xD;
Far across the lake a castle rose in the air with such a brilliant&#xD;
whiteness, that it attracted my attention, and I asked Antonio&#xD;
whose it was. He said, it belonged to the Duke di Gatana. Ga-&#xD;
tana! what recollections that name awakened in me! My name!&#xD;
If my poor dead father's patriotic efforts had been crowned with&#xD;
success-how differently would my destiny have shaped itself! I&#xD;
would now dwell in palaces, and receive the homages of hun-&#xD;
dreds. I would be a duchess and wear a crown, a real crown, and&#xD;
be admitted to court. But then, would I be happier? Would&#xD;
I even now exchange, if such exchange lay in my power? Not I!&#xD;
For it was the exile who found Charlie; it was the exile, that gained&#xD;
his love and learned to return it, and for all the castles in the&#xD;
world I would not sell the thought: Charles, good, noble Charles&#xD;
belongs to me; he is my own, my property! a domain that no so-&#xD;
vereign king can show! No! I do not want my duchy back, if, in&#xD;
receiving it, I must give up my love.. Yet I should like to visit&#xD;
that castle! I wonder, whether it is the one, in which my parents&#xD;
used to live? I should also like to see the Duke, the new Duke;&#xD;
for undoubtedly the domains of my ancestors have been bestowed&#xD;
upon some faithful follower of the government.&#xD;
These reflections and many more engaged my attention to such&#xD;
a degree, that I stood some time-I do not know how long-gaz-&#xD;
ing at the castle in -total oblivion, of iny surroundings. All at.&#xD;
ouce however I was recalled to reality in rather a startling Inan-&#xD;

looked right into a face, well calculated to create alarm. The per-&#xD;
son that had thus rudely drawn my attention to himself was a tall,&#xD;
wild-looking man with hardly sufficient clothing to cover his pow-&#xD;
erful body. A low-crowned felt hat sat sideways on masses ofb&#xD;
black, dishevelled hair, and a pair of sparkling and dismal-looking&#xD;
eyes shone from under shaggy brows. I was frightened at is&#xD;
s ht and my face must have betrayed my fear, for he smiled with.&#xD;
a sinister satisfaction, which foreboded me nothing good.&#xD;
"What do you want?" I asked him and summoned all the cour-&#xD;
age I could command. At the same time I looked around for my&#xD;
servant-he had disappeared.&#xD;
My question spoken in fluent Italian seemed to startle the man.&#xD;
He hadqunstedly expected me to be a foreign Lady, such as&#xD;
ehundoubtregion in lare numbers during the fair season, and&#xD;
it struck me, that I might get rid of him by feigning to be a na-&#xD;
ive-which in reality I was.&#xD;
The man stepped back a step.itof a&#xD;
"Excuse me," he said touching his hat~ith the grace&#xD;
grandee; "is signora Italian ?"&#xD;
"Of course I am, my friend--what  makes you asks"&#xD;
"I thought you were with the foreign family in the old castle."&#xD;
"So I am; but I am not their daughter. I am an&#xD;
an orphan too at that. But what do you wish of me?&#xD;
I thought, it would be well, to invoke, his compassion, as cour-&#xD;
age and pluck could avail but little against so powerful an adver-&#xD;
sary. My manoeuvre had the desired effect, for the conduct of the&#xD;
man became more and more civil, and touching his hat a second&#xD;
time, he said:&#xD;
"If you are Italian,madam, I do not want anything, except you,&#xD;
you feel disposed to favor me with a gift. There are enou&#xD;
eigners we can plunder-I am too good a patriot, to raise  y&#xD;
hand against a daughter of my country."&#xD;
"Then you are a brigand ?" I asked considerably assured by&#xD;
his polite conduct, handing him at the same time my little purse.&#xD;
He received it with a polite bow and slipping it into his pocket&#xD;

"And you are permitted, to carry on your dangerous profession&#xD;
so openly?"&#xD;
The brigand,-for that he was in spite of his love for romantic&#xD;
names-the brigand, I say, shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
"Who will hinder us?" he said. "The hotelkeeper, the grocer,&#xD;
the milkvender, the servant--they all follow our trade, robbing&#xD;
the strangers all the time in the most legitimate manner-why&#xD;
then forbid us the innocent pass time of robbing a little every&#xD;
once in a while? In fact those noble confederates I mentioned&#xD;
do not begrudge us the mite we take from their victims;-they&#xD;
acknowledge our claims and as to the sbirri?--bah! I care that&#xD;
much for all their enmity."&#xD;
He snapped his fingers and I must confess, that I began to look&#xD;
at the fellow with quite different eyes. I had read so much about&#xD;
these brigands and their tincture of romance; but to read about a&#xD;
robber and to meet one are very different things. I wanted to&#xD;
benefit by this opportunity and ask several other questions con-&#xD;
cerning their daring calling and mode of living; but my brigand&#xD;
cut me short.&#xD;
"Excuse me, Signora, if I must;refuse to converse with you any&#xD;
longer. Although I despise the sbirri, one ought not to chal-&#xD;
lenge fate. Moreover I warn you against myself. When I said&#xD;
that I did not feel disposed, to rob a country-woman, I did not&#xD;
know, that those superb eyes of yours are on the best way of&#xD;
stealing my heart. I warn you, signora, to depart--Luigi has not&#xD;
the reputation of being a very tame lover."&#xD;
I shuddered inwardly, although I was strong enough to keep&#xD;
up an outward appearance of composure. Thanking the ma nfor&#xD;
his considerate treatment, I bade him good bye and pursued the&#xD;
road, which, as I knew, would take me to our house. I did not&#xD;
venture to walk fast, for fear, the brigand would notice unfavor-&#xD;
ably my desire of escaping from his presence. Still the. distance&#xD;
between us increasing gradually, I began to feel easier and to no-&#xD;
tice once more the beauties of'the country. While thus engaged&#xD;
my eye was all at once attracted by the sight of Mr. Antonio, who&#xD;
followed me with such an unconcern, that, instead of getting&#xD;

"What do you want here, Antonio?" I asked after a good spell&#xD;
of laughter, summoning all the sternness, then at my command.&#xD;
"Go home with you," was the unconcerned reply.&#xD;
"What? after your dastardly conduct? I shall tell Mr. Fox of&#xD;
your bravery and he will chase you from the house as soon as he&#xD;
comes back."'&#xD;
Antonio shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
"What do you want?" he said with the mien of an injured man&#xD;
you dont expect me to expose myself to the rage of the famous&#xD;
Lui"So you know the gentleman? Who is this Luigi?"&#xD;
"The greatest brigand in northern Italy. Did you never hear&#xD;
of Luigi?"&#xD;
Forunately I hadn't, for if on hearing his name I had known all&#xD;
the stories of that robber's gallantry, cunning, cruelty and daring&#xD;
with which Antonio entertained me on the balance of our home*&#xD;
ward journey, I don't think, I should have had the strength, to&#xD;
reain t  composure, which, in connexion with my knowledge&#xD;
of Italian, saved me from his hands. When I think of the whole&#xD;
affair, I cannot.help remarking, that, if the American servants&#xD;
excel the Italian ones, I see myself compelled- to award the prize&#xD;
to the Italian robbers in preference to our own. I must laugh,&#xD;
when I imagine myself face to face with the scum of society, that&#xD;
represent the stealing fraternity of the United States. I fear I&#xD;
would hardly have received from them an equally considerate&#xD;
treatment. My brigand is surrounded with something like a halo&#xD;
m                -though I am not at all prepared to assert,&#xD;
tha polish and courtesy make vice less vicious. Perhaps they&#xD;
may have the effect of making it less repulsive, and it is as yet an&#xD;
open question, whether that is productive of better morals or&#xD;
'worse...&#xD;
woSnce.e above adventure, I am a little more careful in the&#xD;
election of means, to gratify my passion for nature and its beau&#xD;

now painting a view from my window in Sepia, as a present for&#xD;
father, when he returns. By the by, he has been absent now for&#xD;
more than a week, and we have not had the slightest sign of life&#xD;
from him. I cannot help thinking of Mr. Luigi and his assocj-&#xD;
ates, though of course I keep my thoughts most carefully to my-&#xD;
self. It would make mother nervous and restless, to imagine her&#xD;
husband in the slightest danger. Ever since that memorable.&#xD;
sickness, she perfectly dotes upon him, and it is no wonder, for&#xD;
he carries her always---so to speak-on his hands. Of course I&#xD;
never told my adventure to her or Lucy, for reasons obvious--if&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
r JOURNEY AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.&#xD;
Here the diary abruptly ends, for reasons, which the readers&#xD;
may by and by discern themselves. Failing to gain any informa-&#xD;
tion from our heroine herself, we can perhaps do nothing better,&#xD;
than return to the moment of Mr. Fox' departure, and using our&#xD;
free-pass as the author and his friends, enter with him the carriage&#xD;
that takes him to the place, where a railroad facilitates a more&#xD;
rapid journey to the capital. When we started, it was the hour&#xD;
of morning, and when the steeples of Turin became isible in the&#xD;
distance, another morning had just been ushered in. Mr. Fox&#xD;
and his secretary were not overloaded with baggage, and so they&#xD;
succeeded without much delay, in reaching a hotel. There, after&#xD;
the necessary ablutions and a meal, which fitted them for busi-&#xD;
ness, Mr. Fox sent for one of the waiters. When the man came&#xD;
the guest inquired by means of his famnulus:&#xD;
"My friend, do you happen to know, whether the Duke di Ga-&#xD;
tana is in town?"&#xD;
"I cannot serve yqur Excellency; but I can show your Excel-&#xD;
lency his palace, if that will be of any service."&#xD;
"It w1il answer. If you'll show us the palace, we can pursue&#xD;
our inquiries in person. Where then, does it lie?"&#xD;
"Your Excellency can see it from the window. It is across the&#xD;

place: Does your Excellency notice that large building over&#xD;
there?"&#xD;
"Exactly.".&#xD;
"Well that is the palace. If your Excellency will wait a few&#xD;
minutes, I can easily ascertain, whether the family is in the city."&#xD;
The waiter was already at the door overlooking the -energetic&#xD;
"nevermind!" of Mr. Fox. To find out deserves a drink-money&#xD;
and the waiter is not the man, to let the opportunity of making&#xD;
an honest penny slip by, without improving it. He flies,he re-&#xD;
turns, he is already back and with a quicker breath, that shows&#xD;
the greatness of his exertion, reports that his grace the Duke is&#xD;
not only in town but also at home just then and that his Excel-&#xD;
lency will no doubt be able to see him if he will only take the&#xD;
trouble to walk over.&#xD;
After this announcement the fellow smiles and assuming the&#xD;
immobility of a statue stands before his Excellency with out-&#xD;
stretched hand, a living point of interrogation. The secretary&#xD;
explains and Mr Fox puts an Italin coin in the hand. The hand&#xD;
closes the head bows, the figure turns and the pattern of a lackey&#xD;
withdrawskfrom the Excellency's presence.&#xD;
"Funny people, these Italians !" says Mr. Fox, looking after the&#xD;
waiter "but I have a notion to act upon the rascal's hint andsee&#xD;
whether his Excellency will have the condescension-to receive us.&#xD;
Come James let's make the trial."&#xD;
James is one of those men, who living in a foreign country&#xD;
benefit by their knowledge of several languages, to tap the pock-&#xD;
ets of wealthy travellers by acting in the capacity of* interpreter.&#xD;
Mr. Fox-had fished James in Switzerland, the great vortex, where&#xD;
all nations send their- streams of travellers. Dolores had volun-&#xD;
teered to perform the duties of interpreter herself; but Mr. Fox&#xD;
had his own reasons for declining her offer. He wanted to ex-&#xD;
periment on her chances for the dutchy and in case of failure hide&#xD;
*     the whole attempt from her knowledge. Therefore he had suf-&#xD;
fered himself to be taken in tow by Mr. James Fitzgerald, who&#xD;
now in his company passed the square separating their hotel from&#xD;
the.Duke's palace.&#xD;
Arriving at the portal, Mr. Fox handed his card to a porter,&#xD;
and was conducted into a kind of antechamber, to await the&#xD;
Duke's pleasure.&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                      375&#xD;
After the expiration of a few minutes a servant appeared and&#xD;
requesting the visitors to follow him, led the way into the interior&#xD;
of the house and up a flight of stairs into the second story. Every&#xD;
where marks of great wealth met Mr. Fox' eye and that gentle-&#xD;
man couldn't help thinking, what a nice thing it would be, if Dol-&#xD;
ores could all at once step into such riches. He was not through&#xD;
yet with this pleasant thought, when the servant ushered them&#xD;
into an antichamber and opening an interior folding door, an-&#xD;
nounced:&#xD;
"Signor Foggs and secretary !"&#xD;
On entering Mr. Fox perceived a man, whose family resem-&#xD;
blance with the dying minstrel and even with Dolores proved to a&#xD;
certainty that he was the Duke. He was a handsome man of&#xD;
about forty years of age and would have made a pleasant enough&#xD;
impression on the visitor, if the face had not been too much&#xD;
drawn into lines of haughty reserve and the eye had glanced&#xD;
through the lids with less sharpness. As it was Mr. Fox was not&#xD;
favorably impressed and at once made up his mind that with such&#xD;
an occupant of dignity, nothing but rigid exaction and unbend-&#xD;
ing firmness would answer the purpose. Therefore when the&#xD;
Duke arose and saluted the stranger with cold formality, Mr. Fox&#xD;
bowed to the host with a stiffness, that seemed to say:&#xD;
"Just as you please, Sir. We in America can stand as well on&#xD;
our dignity as any Italian Duke."&#xD;
"Be seated" said the Duke "what gives me the pleasure of this&#xD;
call ?"&#xD;
"I accept your civility, for, what I have to tell you, cannot be&#xD;
said in a second. I come from the United States, Sir, the asylum&#xD;
of most of your exiled countrymen."&#xD;
When this remark was -interpreted to the Duke, he started&#xD;
slightly and his eye looked at the visitor with double keenness,&#xD;
to ascertain whether his words conveyed any hidden meaning.&#xD;
"Yes I know Signor Foggs, or Fuggio-or-"&#xD;
"Fox, Sir."&#xD;
"Ah! Foggs then. Your visit, I was going to say, has hardly&#xD;
the purpose of manifesting your sympathy with those country-&#xD;
men of mine?"&#xD;
"No Sir, not a bit of it, not a bit of it. Or rather, yes I do&#xD;
mean, to show my sympathy for one of them at least."&#xD;
&#xD;

"Please explain Sir."&#xD;
The Duke smiled a supercilious smile.&#xD;
"Never you fear, Sir Duke, I'm coming right to the point. The&#xD;
man I allude to, is nothing more nor less, than the former Duke&#xD;
your brother."&#xD;
Mr. Fox had the pleasure to see that his straightforwardness&#xD;
was not without the desired effect upon the host. The hand,&#xD;
which rested on the back of the chair from which he had risen,&#xD;
grasped that back more firmly to hide a slight trembling and the&#xD;
otherhand figeted up and down the buttons of his vest. He evi-&#xD;
dently did not know what to reply and so chose the expedient of&#xD;
remaining silent. Mr. Fox continued:&#xD;
"I am happy to say, that the Duke had full confidence in my in-&#xD;
tegrity and that he intrusted me with the keeping pf the most im-&#xD;
portant documents. These documents involve the inheritance of&#xD;
all his estates and you will hardly wonder, Sir, that I thought&#xD;
best to attend to such important business in person. In other&#xD;
words you see in me the deputy or plenipotentiary of the Duke,&#xD;
to arrange with you the proper means of settling the succession&#xD;
and other matters appertaining to his former possessions."&#xD;
Mr. Fox had on purpose spoken somewhat pompously, partly&#xD;
to avenge the Duke's supercilious reception, partly to impress&#xD;
him with the conviction, that he had to deal with a man of con-&#xD;
sequence. Nor did his purpose fail him. While listening to these&#xD;
sudden  and unexpected revelations, the Duke had become&#xD;
more and more pale. He had made no effort to interrupt the&#xD;
stranger; nor did he speak at once after he had finished; but fi-&#xD;
nally as if aware of the necessity of saying something in return,&#xD;
he answered in an uncertain tone of voice:&#xD;
"My brother-the Duke-I was laboring under the impres 'on,&#xD;
that he was dead. At least my efforts to find a trac   ere&#xD;
idled. I continued them for years and finally gave them up, be-&#xD;
cause convicted of the utter hopelessness of their continuance.&#xD;
So you bring me word from him?"&#xD;
"Yes Sir, though a message from the grave."&#xD;
"Hah! you trifle with my feelings Sir! Be.vare or you may&#xD;
learn to your cost, that the Duke di Gatana is not to be played&#xD;
with."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES..                       377&#xD;
Mr. Fox remained unmoved.    Duke or not duke-that was&#xD;
rather indifferent to his republican nature.&#xD;
"You are mistaken, if you think, that I am playing, Sir," he&#xD;
said. "I am in dead earnest. If the Duke is not living, his right-&#xD;
ful heir is, and that is the same thing to all effects and purposes&#xD;
-is it not, Sir?"&#xD;
The alarm of the other began anew. Yet he tried more eva-&#xD;
sions.&#xD;
"Perhaps you are not aware, Sir stranger, that the domains of&#xD;
the Duke, my brother, were confiscated by the government on ac-&#xD;
count of certain revolutionary attempts of his?"&#xD;
"I am aware of that and also of the fact, that the property was&#xD;
restored after the war."&#xD;
"And this son of the exile, this nephew of mine-where may&#xD;
he be now?"&#xD;
"You are mistaken again by imagining, that the heir is a son.&#xD;
It is a daughter, Sir, and she has been educated in my house. It&#xD;
seems that these communications are not very desirable to your&#xD;
race; but I assure you, if you could see the young lady-the&#xD;
most lovely and perfect woman my eye ever rested upon-you&#xD;
would rejoice in the thought, that she is your kin."&#xD;
The brow of the Italian cleared up a little on this communica-&#xD;
tion. A girl! There was solace in that thought. A beautiful&#xD;
girl! that was better yet. He had a son and by uniting the two&#xD;
branches of the house, he might still retain the princely posses-&#xD;
sions in his family. But that man might be an imposter. True,&#xD;
an inner voice told him the contrary; but still he might be, or he&#xD;
might be lacking the means, to prove his bold assertions. In&#xD;
such a case, the Duke could easily maintain his position against&#xD;
an obscure stranger and his ward. Yes it was worth the trial.&#xD;
"What you say there,-Signor, sounds fair enough; but you can&#xD;
hardly expect, that I should credit the words of the first best&#xD;
stranger, who tells me of the discovery of a niece. I suppose you&#xD;
are prepared to substantiate your assertions with sufficient proof?"&#xD;
"That is, you suppose, I am not prepared;" Mr. Fox muttered&#xD;
to himself; then raising his voice, he said:&#xD;
"Such a supposition is entirely correct, Sir duke. I have with&#xD;
me tha copies of papers, which prove the descent of Dolores be-&#xD;

&#xD;
yond a doubt. - Here they are Signor, subject to your examin-~&#xD;
tion. Recollect, these papers are mere copies!"&#xD;
Mr. Fox said this with a cunning smile, that showed plainly,&#xD;
how little confidence he placed in the integrity of a man, that&#xD;
manifested such reluctance to receive a brother's daughter, be-&#xD;
cause she threatened to assert her rights. The Duke understood&#xD;
it too; but he merely bit his lips and receiving the copy of the&#xD;
documents ran'his eye over them with haste and eagerness. The&#xD;
stranger was right. If the original papers were really in his pos-&#xD;
session-and the knowledge of the name Dolores seemed to war-&#xD;
rant it-it would be vain to show an open fight against such&#xD;
proofs. Open fight! His mind dwelt on this thought, and in a&#xD;
moment the duke had resolved upon a different policy. His fore-&#xD;
head became smooth; his eyes lost their stinging sharpness; his&#xD;
mouth was wreathed in smiles; and stepping forward and extend-&#xD;
ing his right hand towards the stranger, he said with great polite-&#xD;
ness:&#xD;
"Signor Foggs, you have conquered, me. Will you accept the&#xD;
hand of a man, whose duty it was to doubt, until convinced?"&#xD;
Mr. Fox was surprised at this sudden change; but the Duke&#xD;
appealed to his fairness and such an appeal is irresistible to an&#xD;
upright man. So our friend without hesitation accepted and shook&#xD;
the proffered hand, and in a few words expressed his satisfaction&#xD;
at the other's change.&#xD;
The Duke now invited his guests to a seat, and ringing the bell&#xD;
ordered refreshments.&#xD;
"You must really pardon my reserve, Signor," he said. "I am&#xD;
beset by so many adventurers, that I can hardly be sufficiently&#xD;
careful against their snares. But a fair man confesses his 'mistake&#xD;
and I am glad to assure you that I am in that case. Here, sig-&#xD;
nor, do me the favor to accept a glass of wine grown on my own&#xD;
soil. If it isn't the best in the world, there is certainly much&#xD;
that's inferior."&#xD;
"It is excellent, Sir Duke. Permit me to empty this glass to&#xD;
your health."&#xD;
"Let us rather drink the health of her, whom I am now anxious&#xD;
to call my niece. I hope you have not left her beyond the ocean?"&#xD;
"No,' Sir, my whole family accompanies me on this journey.&#xD;
You see, I reckon Dolores as a member of my family."-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       379&#xD;
"I doubt not, that she fully appreciates that honor. You must&#xD;
at some more propitious moment tell me her story, which may&#xD;
be romantic enough, I wager. At present I am impatient to learn&#xD;
her whereabouts in order to procede to her without delay and of-&#xD;
her an uncle's welcome."&#xD;
The Duke spoke with such apparent sincerity that Mr. Fox suf-&#xD;
.fered himself to be deceived. He shook the hand of the host a&#xD;
second time and declared repeatedly, that such language pleased&#xD;
him infinitely better, than the Duke's original reserve.&#xD;
"As to the girl'.e said "she will be pleased, to receive in you&#xD;
her father's brother. Thus fare she has no idea of the object'of&#xD;
my tour. I did not want to subject her to any disappointment&#xD;
in case of a failure of my plans."&#xD;
"You are as wise as honest, signor" the duke responded warmly&#xD;
"but you have not yet gratified my curiosity as to the where&#xD;
abouts of my niece."&#xD;
"That's true. We av rented a building on the Lago di Como&#xD;
which they call the old cas&#xD;
"Exactly, I know the place, as I have been negociating for its&#xD;
purchase."&#xD;
"Indeed signor ? Why I am lad to hear it."&#xD;
"We are even neighbors" th Duke resumed. "I own a manor&#xD;
on the opposite side of the  e. The white house is visible from&#xD;
your windows."&#xD;
"I think it is, Sir Duke, for I have noticed such a building. I&#xD;
cannot help feeling greatly gratified at the issue of this inter-&#xD;
view."&#xD;
"You cannot be any more so, than I Signor Foggs; but it is in&#xD;
your power, to gratify. me still more by granting one, request.&#xD;
It is hardly meet that the benefactor of our family should&#xD;
lodge in a hotel, while I possess a home to shelter him. Say that&#xD;
you have no objection and I'll send this very minute for your&#xD;
baggage."&#xD;
"We have nothing but a small valise; but Signor-."&#xD;
"No "buts" Signor, unless you want'to hurt my feelings. If&#xD;
ever I visit the United States, I shall submit to similar arrange-&#xD;
ents. Iiere you are my guest and must submit to the sacred&#xD;
obligations, which hospitality makes it my duty and plauet&#xD;

What could Mr. Fox say against such generous sentiments?&#xD;
He submitted and before the expiration of another hour he found&#xD;
himself installed in a comfortable chamber of the dukal palace,&#xD;
with-James as a companion, He saw with great satisfaction the,&#xD;
princeysplendor of every piece of furniture in the room; but&#xD;
fortunately lor his peace of mind he did not notice,how soon after&#xD;
his occupation, a servant took his position near the door, looking&#xD;
for the world like a sentinel on duty. Was he placed there, to pre-&#xD;
vent them from suffering or from doing harm? There was an-&#xD;
other feature in the Duke's conduct, which would havc alarmed&#xD;
Mr Fox, if he had been cognizant of its. It was this. Immedi-&#xD;
ately after the withdrawal of the visitors, theDuke had sent for a&#xD;
certain Giacomo. The man had come and been closeted with his&#xD;
for more than an hour. On leaving him he had pocketed&#xD;
a well filled purse, which the Duke had handed him, and then&#xD;
taken the direction to the depot. On arriving there he had in-&#xD;
uired for the next eastern train and learning that an express&#xD;
would leave for Venice in half an hour, had hought a ticket for&#xD;
Pavia, the station next to the Lago di Como. These movements&#xD;
as we have said, would certainly have made Mr. Fox nervous and&#xD;
restless, if he had only noticed them; but fortunately-or ought&#xD;
we to say unfortunately?-he remained in total ignorance about&#xD;
them. He enjoyed himself highly in his new quarters and it must&#xD;
be confessed, that the Duke left nothing undone, toentertain his&#xD;
guest. He showed him all the- sights of the city and plunging&#xD;
him fromeone amusementainto another, caused him to forget to&#xD;
ascertain the degree, that an anxious family was daily expecting&#xD;
his return or at least a sign of life. The conduct of the Duke,&#xD;
made this seeming negligence somewhat excusable, day for day&#xD;
after he asserted his burning desire, to meet his niece- and ex-'&#xD;
presseda deep regret, that circumstances prevented his depart-&#xD;
ure. He did not explain, how it happened, that these cir-&#xD;
eumstancesdid not prevent his devotion to amusements of all&#xD;
kinds; but Mr. Fox enjoyed himself, and a man that does, is&#xD;
not inclined to be over scrupulous.&#xD;

CHAPTER XL.&#xD;
A COUPLE OF OLD ACQUAINTANCES.&#xD;
While this was going on in Turin, a young man,-a pedestrian&#xD;
-followed the mountain-road, that led around the western shore&#xD;
of Lago di Como. The traveller marched vigorously in spite of&#xD;
the hot sun and the hour of noon, which was near at hand. To&#xD;
judge from the dust on his clothes, he must have passed over a&#xD;
good piece of ground that morning; but excepting an occasional&#xD;
lifting of his light straw hat, in order to wipe the perspiration o ff&#xD;
his brow, he showed no sign of exertion, much less fatigue. When&#xD;
he stopped, it was less for the purpose of resting, than of catch-&#xD;
ing and fastening a delightful view upon his sketch book. It is&#xD;
at such a moment, that he first engages our attention. He has&#xD;
left the main road and climbing up a rocky cliff reached a plateau,&#xD;
from which a charming view into the valley and lake, paid him for&#xD;
the little trouble. A few bushes gave him shade and made super-&#xD;
fluous the straw hat, which the artist had laid on the grass at&#xD;
his side. A well-seasoned thorn cane with many knots protrud-&#xD;
ing, lay beside the hat, apparently an .innocent, but yet efficient&#xD;
weapon of defence. A glance into the young man's breast-pocket&#xD;
would however have shown us the butt end of a good revolver, as&#xD;
an additional protection, leaving out of account, the lithe athletic&#xD;
form of the artistwho seemed as well qualified to handle the&#xD;
cane or a sword, as the pencil.&#xD;
.e drew a castle on the opposite side of the lake, whose dela-&#xD;
p daed, weatherbeaten exterior made it a proper subject for a&#xD;
sketch. After drawing the general outlines he looked more&#xD;
sharply for some details and failing to make out one or two es-&#xD;
sential features, took his pocket teoscope, to assist him. By&#xD;
means of it he discovered various feaefgrsYoigo       h&#xD;
porch or balcony and the sight seemed to affect him, for allowing&#xD;
the telescope to sink and the sketch book to fall to the ground,&#xD;
he let his head drop uponshis hand,which in turn was supported&#xD;
by the elbow resting on the knee and-mused. His thoughts&#xD;
were evidently of o melancholy character, for a deep sigh escaped&#xD;
from his bosom. We are not able to state whether a second&#xD;

ber of the trio lay on the ground with a dagger sticking to the&#xD;

fate of his companions by beating a dangerous and precipitous&#xD;
retreat down the -cliff. The artist was in the act of witnessing&#xD;

"We?" the artist inquired. "I do not see why I should be in&#xD;
danger.&#xD;
"If you don't see it, take my word for it. You have assisted&#xD;
Luioagainst the sbirri, and that is an offence, they'll never par-&#xD;
don."&#xD;
The young man snatched up his sketch book and-then suffered&#xD;
himself to be led by his companion over a rather rough road deeper&#xD;
and higher up into the mountain, until at last every mark of cult-&#xD;
ivation had disappeared., The respect, with which the bravery of&#xD;
his guide had filled the artist, had thus far prevented him from&#xD;
making any remonstrances; but when the country became wilder&#xD;
and wilder, and every vestige of a road or even path disappeared&#xD;
it struck him, that it might be. prudent, to ask some explanation&#xD;
from a stranger, who, though brave, might nevertheless be a&#xD;
great scoundrel. In fact, the name of Luigi, which he had given&#xD;
as being his, had no good sound in the regions from which he&#xD;
came. The papers had been full with accounts -of a famous bri-&#xD;
gand of that name, and from what the artist had witnessed, he&#xD;
was well inclined to think, that this Luigi and the hero of the pa-&#xD;
pers, might be identical. Therefore he stopped abruptly, and said:&#xD;
"Mr. Luigi, that is quite enough for friendship's sake. I have&#xD;
done you a service, and you repaid me by .saving me from the&#xD;
rough contact with the police. At least you say you have, and I&#xD;
shall take your word for it; but as to following you without any&#xD;
guarantee or explanation, why, it is altogether out of question."&#xD;
The Italian eyed the speaker with undisguised affection and&#xD;
respect.&#xD;
"I see you are a brave fellow," he replied; "or you would not&#xD;
beard the lion in his den. Very few persons dare to speak to&#xD;
Luigi as you have spoken-what would you do, if I should now&#xD;
turn my hand against you?"&#xD;
"I should endeavor to prove to you, that an America gentle-&#xD;
man is at least as much of a match, as three-fold the number of&#xD;
your sbirri."&#xD;
"I know yoi would, Signor, I know it. But nothing is further&#xD;

"By showing me the straightest road out of this wilderness. I&#xD;
want to reach the next town yet before evening."&#xD;
"That is impossible, Signor, for it is past 12 now, and the dis-&#xD;
tance to Pesanto' is more than 20 miles."&#xD;
The .artist suffered an exclamation of impatience to slip from&#xD;
his lips. The brigand took his hand.&#xD;
"Signor" he said with earnest supplication "listen to my prayer!&#xD;
do not forsake me now! - I have so few to love and you by your&#xD;
noble and chivalrous bearing have gained my love to its fullest&#xD;
extent. Do not feel offended! do not laugh at me eitherf for a&#xD;
man, who like me, has to associate so much with the scum of so-&#xD;
ciety, feels the charm of an honest man's company stronger than-&#xD;
that of handsome women. Grant me the pleasure of spending&#xD;
a few hours at least in your company, so that in after years, I.&#xD;
may say to myself or to the people : "I have seen a man!"&#xD;
The artist laughed.&#xD;
"Burlesque over and over !" he cried, thereby setting aside our&#xD;
last scruple as to his identity. It is Charles Fuchs and knowing&#xD;
that much, we may as well give him his proper appelation.&#xD;
"Burlesque over and over!" he cried "and for the sake of Bur-&#xD;
lesque I will grant your prayer. I am at your disposal, Signor;&#xD;
you may do with me, as suits your pleasure."&#xD;
Instead of all thanks Luigi took his hand and led him still deeper&#xD;
up the pass, through which they had been stumbling; but after&#xD;
the expiration of a quarter of an hour the path came suddenly to&#xD;
an end. The cleft in the mountain grew much narrower and a&#xD;
number of rocks having detached themselves from the steep walls&#xD;
and fallen "pele-mele" into the pass, seemed to stop every advance.&#xD;
But Luigi was evidently at home here; climbing over a rock now&#xD;
and slipping past another, he finally reached a kind of kettle or&#xD;
caldron, which for protection or seclusion could not be surpassed.&#xD;
Besides a sentinel, which guarded the outer entrance to the&#xD;
grotto, the place was occupied by about half a dozen rough look-&#xD;
ing fellows, who enjoyed their leisure in'as many different posi-&#xD;
tions as they numbered persons. The voice of the captain called&#xD;
them suddenly to their feet; their eyes looked wildly and spite-&#xD;

what that means :. he is my friend. He is tabooed, sacred, invio-&#xD;
lable. To touch him yes even to offend him is certain death-&#xD;
you know me!"&#xD;
The eyes of the robbers dwelt as darkly upon the stranger as&#xD;
before. Luigi saw it. Not so much, to yield to them, as because&#xD;
he chose td communicate the reason of his action, he said:&#xD;
"This gentleman has saved my life. He came to my assistance&#xD;
in a fight with three sbirri.  I came near being overpowered-.&#xD;
you know what that means-I shall never become a prisoner."&#xD;
Now a sudden motion came into the brigands. They ran to&#xD;
shake hands with the stranger, and there was not one amongst&#xD;
them, who did not offer him the free use of his dagger. Having&#xD;
thus shown their gratefulness, the men dispersed, and Luigitook&#xD;
Charles to a hut, which was well furnished considering the place,&#xD;
and its occupant. Instead of wooden furniture, which the nar-&#xD;
row passage made impossible, cushions and'-mattresses covered&#xD;
the floor along the walls, and when Charles in obedience to his&#xD;
host's summons stretched his somewhat fatigued limbs on one of&#xD;
these mattresses, his head resting on a silken pillow, he compared&#xD;
himself to a Turkish pasha, who prepares to give audience to his&#xD;
eunuchs and the members of his seraglio. But Luigi showed&#xD;
himself a good host in other respects as well; for fifteen minutes&#xD;
after their arrival, a number of savory dishes stood before them,&#xD;
to find which palatable, one needed not to be very hungry at all.&#xD;
"You lead a comfortable life, Signor Luigi," Charles remarked&#xD;
to his host, while enjoying his meal.. "These meats are well pro-&#xD;
pared, the bread is good, the fruit is delicious, and the wine worthy&#xD;
of a king."&#xD;
Luigi shrugged his' shoulders.&#xD;
"Abundance one day and want the next," he said; "that is onr&#xD;
lot. You had a fair specimen this morning of the danger, which&#xD;
besets us on our way."&#xD;
"Then you do not follow a brigand's calling from selection?"&#xD;
"No Signor, a wanton act of folly committed in the exuberance&#xD;
of youth threw me out of my career, and compelled me to seek&#xD;
the mountains. Such a life once begun is hard to quit again, and&#xD;
I lead it as much from necessity as from choice, I say this unto&#xD;
you, though I should be very careful, to hide such sentinreats&#xD;
from my comrades."&#xD;

"I am glad you have such confidence in me. To reward it, I&#xD;
can do nothing better, than to offer you my assistance in begin-&#xD;
ning a new, life. Go with me to my country across the ocean;&#xD;
there, a man of nerve, will, and intelligence such as you possess,&#xD;
cannot fail to meet with success. I am not without %means and&#xD;
influence in my sphere, and what I can do for you, will certainly&#xD;
be done.",&#xD;
Luigi was moved, more deeply moved than he chose to show;&#xD;
but the strong pressure of his hand and the sudden hoarseness&#xD;
in his throat betrayed him.&#xD;
"You are very kind Signor-I have not learned. your name.&#xD;
yet?"&#xD;
"They call me Charles ,Fuchs across here, which, in Italian-&#xD;
would be as much as Carlo Fuchs."&#xD;
"Well signor Carlo, I was going to say that I appreciate your&#xD;
kindness from the fullness of my heart. The thought of going&#xD;
with you is very tempting; but an oath binds me to my compan-&#xD;
ions, which I cannot break, No, no, signor, I shall have to ful-&#xD;
fill my destiny, which is the hempen rope or at best an ounce of&#xD;
lead."_&#xD;
"But would your comrades not wish to join you in so com-&#xD;
mendable an enterprise? I extend my hospitality to them, prov-&#xD;
ided they pledge to me their vow to become new and better men."&#xD;
"I'll think of it, signor, and I will tell them. It is my duty to&#xD;
hold out to them this chance; but I doubt very much, whether&#xD;
they would like the proposition-they have,. most of them, sunk&#xD;
too deep, to extricate themselves as easily as that.".&#xD;
The meal being over, thc conversation stopped and the brigand&#xD;
and his guest left the hut, to enjoy the delightful air in front of&#xD;
it. While Luigi went to his men and spoke toqthenm ofthe gener-&#xD;
ous offers of the stranger, Charles took out his, sketch book and&#xD;
began to sketch some of the interesting groups before. him. In&#xD;
Italy there is a certain romance, a vestige of nobility to be found&#xD;
in the very 'dregs of the populace and if the painter wants a.&#xD;
model for a hero, an apostle he seeks amongst the peasantry of&#xD;
the mounains. Charles sketched with interest, the pencil flew&#xD;
rapidly across the paper and he hardly noticed the return of&#xD;
Luigi, who stopped oves his shoulders, watching curiously the&#xD;
progress of the work.&#xD;

Charles smiled painfully.&#xD;
"Never mind Luigi, you are perfectly excusable. It is my busi-&#xD;
ness to ask your pardon for showing such unmanly weakness."&#xD;
"Then you love unhappily?"&#xD;
Charles replied by nodding. This was the first time since -his&#xD;
departure from home, that this subject had been: broached by or&#xD;
to him. Carefully the feelings of his heart had been pent up, and&#xD;
he thought sometimes that the moment was nearat hand, of which&#xD;
he had spoken in the letter to his mother, and that he soon should&#xD;
be able to write to her again. But now the wild uproar of his&#xD;
bosom taught him differently, and like young wine in fermenta&#xD;
tion, which threatens to break the cask confining it, the fulness&#xD;
of his long stifled emotions forced an utterance. He rose and&#xD;
paced the narrow space with an energy, as if he wished to bnrst&#xD;
the rocky bounds, that hemmed his movements. Luigi felt ex-&#xD;
tremely unhappy at this unfortunate occurence, but for full fifteen&#xD;
minutes his guest refused to listen to his words. At last however&#xD;
the first paroxysm of his grieflhaving spent itself, he returned of&#xD;
himself, to where Luigi was sitting with a mournful face.&#xD;
"Excuse me, my good signor," he said with an. attempt to&#xD;
smile";- "this is the first time for a long while, that my sore heart&#xD;
has been'touched. The shock was too much for me and you see,&#xD;
that I had to yield.to the powerful emotions, which swayed me&#xD;
like the hurricane sways a reed. Now it is over and I promise&#xD;
you, to save you the repitition of so unmanly an aspect."&#xD;
Luigi took both his hands.&#xD;
"I feel for you; but I shall never recur to that sad face again.&#xD;
Charles shook his head.&#xD;
"There you are wrong, Signor. The first pain being over, I&#xD;
wish nothing better, than to speak of her. Oh Luigi, there is not&#xD;
one girl like her, in the world, and though she breathes thousands&#xD;
of miles from here, and the broad Atlantic ocean rolls its mighty&#xD;
floods between us, she attracts me as powerful as the pole the&#xD;

Charles nodded,&#xD;
Then she must have a duplicate--Y saw this very face a few&#xD;
days ago on the shore of Lago di Como."&#xD;
Charles sprang up again, the prey of excitement--.-this announce-&#xD;
nent was too much for his composure. But then he-Ybegan to&#xD;
think, and'as the conviction seized his mind that the statement&#xD;
of Luigi could not possibly be correct, he smiled bitterly, and&#xD;
with a shake of his head resumed his seat.&#xD;
"I am a fool," he said in melancholy tones. "I know she ' can-&#xD;
not be here, and yet I suffer myself to go frantic by the statement,&#xD;
that you have seen her."&#xD;
"If I have not seen her, I have seen somebody, that resemble&#xD;
her, like one egg the other., Has she not long black tresses of&#xD;
luxuriant profusion ?"&#xD;
"She has."&#xD;
'And a high commanding forehead with arched brows from&#xD;
under which a wonderful pair of dark-blue eyes are gazing with&#xD;
high intelligence and just a touch of sadness?"&#xD;
"You paint her to perfection," cried Charles, beginning to be-&#xD;
come excited a second time in spite of his efforts to remain calm.&#xD;
"I recognize Dolores excepting the touch of sadness you men-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"She may be pining for the absent one," Luigi said with a hope-&#xD;
ful smile, as if he wished to encourage the despairing lover. "But&#xD;
I have not yet completed my description. The lady I saw, was of&#xD;
medium size and a model for a Pallas. Never before have' I seen&#xD;
such perfect grace and stately dignity united."&#xD;
"You paint vividly Signor Luigi. The lady seems to have made&#xD;
a deep impression on your heart."&#xD;
"She did, Carlo, Ican assure you," the other replied earnestly&#xD;
"I had to beyhert'pd&#xD;
wishes arisng hr mto depart, to save her from certain curious&#xD;
wishes, arising in my heart."&#xD;
-"Can you give me no nearer details? nothing,. by which an ac-&#xD;

"Of course I can, Dunce, that I was, not to think of it. I had&#xD;
a conversation with the lady in which she told me, that although&#xD;
she was with the Eiglish family in the sold castle--you drew the&#xD;

Here is a.little purse she gave me-gave me, Signor, I swear it&#xD;
by'the madonna-I could ,not have robbed her for the world." .&#xD;
At these words. he pulled out a pocketbook of small dimensions-&#xD;
and fine finish, which Charles recognized on the spot. Dolores&#xD;
had bought it in his presence the day before her departure for&#xD;
school. Every doubt was.at an end and the certainty of the close&#xD;
proximity of her, he loved burst upon him, as the glorious sun&#xD;
on a cloudless morning upon a dazzled world. He was unable to&#xD;
think, he could merely feel and all his feelings centered and burst&#xD;
outinto her name.&#xD;
"It is her purse!" he cried, snatching it from the brigand "it is&#xD;
Dolores' purse and I must have it, if you demand a price ten&#xD;
times its weight in gold. It is Dolores ! here in Italy! near me!&#xD;
r the thought is apt to set me mad! But now Luigi, good Luigi&#xD;
do not delay. Come I must see her. Lead me to the road, that&#xD;
takes me to her presence. Come, Sir, make haste, unless you&#xD;
wish to see me dying with impatience."&#xD;
Rushing into the hut, he snatched his cane and hat and then&#xD;
coming out again seized the arm of Luigi, in order to drag him&#xD;
to the entrance. The brigand saw the hopelessness of stopping&#xD;
his impetuous demand and with a goodnatured smile humored&#xD;
him to a certain extent.&#xD;
"Signor Carlo" he said smiling, "I am ready to conduct you;&#xD;
but you must give ne time for preparation. Recollect our en-&#xD;
counter with the sbirri. If you fall into their hands, I guarantee&#xD;
nothing. "Caught together, hung together." is the motto on&#xD;
which the scoundrels act. No Signor, not so desperately fast.&#xD;
"Boft and fairly goes far" is the adage and it is a true one.-&#xD;
Therefore suffer yourself to be conducted by it."&#xD;
Charles saw the propriety of these remarks; but he found great&#xD;
difficulty to apply to apply them to his case. Yet he checked him-&#xD;
self sufficiently, to allow Luigi time for needful preparations. The&#xD;
brigand assumed a complete disguise and when he had donned&#xD;
the suit of a peasant and stepped before his friend with cane in&#xD;
hand, Charles had difficulty in recognizing the bold dashing rob-&#xD;
ber in the meek, smiling nd. rather stupid looking countryman.&#xD;
"So, now I am ready, to go with you; far you must know,&#xD;
that I have resolved, to. see you safely to the end ofyour journey.-&#xD;

after that adventure of theirs and unless properly guided you&#xD;
might easily fall into their hands. That must not be, if Luigi&#xD;
can help it and therefore he will go with you. Now come along&#xD;
Signor, we have no time to lose; if we want to reach the castle .;S.&#xD;
before night."&#xD;
Charles of coarse had no objection to depart. and so the two&#xD;
retraced their, steps over the tiresome '.road, which they had,&#xD;
pursued in the morning. As long as-, the ravine protected them&#xD;
everything went well,. but on -reaching the margin- of the road&#xD;
they saw theapprehensions of Luigi verified by the presence&#xD;
of large numbers- of armed policemen,. who were scouring the&#xD;
surrounding country in squads of different size.&#xD;
Luigi laughed, when he saw them.&#xD;
"The fools" he said, "they might as well hunt for a pin in&#xD;
the Lago, as hope to catch me, by keeping to the turnpike.&#xD;
But the truth of it is-they are afraid to venture into the moun-&#xD;
tain-passes."&#xD;
"But they will hinder us from pursuing our way?"&#xD;
Luigi shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
"I see no other chance, than to wait for the, cover of night and&#xD;
now across the lake. I have a little boat, that will just answer&#xD;
the purpose. Water leaves no trail and I see no better way to take&#xD;
the bloodhounds from your trail."&#xD;
Charles fretted much at the thought of such delay; but he was&#xD;
sensible enough, to see that Luigi counselled wisely and he finally&#xD;
consented to the proposal, although with a bad enough grace&#xD;
Fortunately-dusk was already near at hand and the hour of 'twi_&#xD;
light being short in all southern countries, the prospect before&#xD;
them was.less gloomy than it had looked at first. The hour of&#xD;
waiting'was mostly-spent in silence; once or-twice a few remarks&#xD;
concerning the old castle and its inhabitants were exchanged,&#xD;
but the suspense and expectation of both of them were not favdr&#xD;
able for an exchange of words and thoughts and Charles started&#xD;
from a deep study, when Luigi finally said:&#xD;
"It's time, Carlo."&#xD;
Cautiously they crossed the road at a place, where it was&#xD;
densely fringed with bushes and making a short tur any object&#xD;
on it from distant spectators. Creeping- on their hands and feet .,&#xD;
they descended the' rocky shore of the lake as well as they .could&#xD;

and finally reaching it undiscovered entered one of the' little&#xD;
skiffs that lay ready for use along the edge of the water. With&#xD;
gentle strokes they forced the craft into the lake and .the skill&#xD;
with which Charles seconded the efforts of his guide, drew more&#xD;
than one wordof' raise from Luigi's lips. So rapid was their&#xD;
progress, that they reached the opposite shore before the dark-.&#xD;
ness of night'had fully 'set in. The feeble twilight was seconded&#xD;
by the moon,,which hadjust raised her first .quarter in the sky&#xD;
and in that: way the inmates of the -skiff were enabled to reach&#xD;
the beach just below 'the place, where the' old castle raised its&#xD;
malls into the air&#xD;

"INow go in, Signor" Luigi addressed his friend "and ascertain&#xD;
how matters stand. I shall wait for you a whole hour until the&#xD;
moon disappears beyond the mountain. If by that time I see no&#xD;
sign of you, I shall construe it as an indication, that everything&#xD;

he said "moreover, I cannot think of leaving you in such .a hope-&#xD;
less ,condition and before I go for good, I shall once more renew'&#xD;
my offer. But Luigi, I fear I have acted like a fool and that my&#xD;
presence in that house will be anything but requited. Tell me,&#xD;
did you notice a certain young mariner in her company?"&#xD;
"No, Carlo, she was alone and I know for sure, that no such&#xD;
person'is in the company. I have a friend of mine in the castle,&#xD;
and from him I know for certain, that the party-consists of the&#xD;
parents and two daughters."&#xD;
"Hah! that relieves me in a measure. I can now hope, that she&#xD;
may have changed her miind, may have awoke as from a dream.&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'll go now, Luigi-.-remember that I want to see you yet this&#xD;
might."&#xD;
Saying tiis the young man left the shore, and ascending the&#xD;
:light of stairs leading to the conrt-yard, soon reached the open&#xD;
:space before the portico. The place looked not only neglected,&#xD;
but even deserted,. and for a moment the heart of Charles stood&#xD;
still with apprehension, that the family he sought, had left. that&#xD;
error however lasted but a moment, for all at once, he noticed&#xD;
servants running to and "fro, as if"in a state-of alarm or-perplex.&#xD;
aty. He entered, and tried to stop one or two of them; but they&#xD;
were too confused, to give him very satisfactory information. A&#xD;
vague fear took hold of him, and he resolved to push on without&#xD;
a previous announcement of his arrival. Following the hall and&#xD;
ascending a broad flight of stairs, he reached the second story,.&#xD;
which was totally dark with the exception of one room, whose&#xD;
.door was on the latch, thus .sending out a narrow streak of' light,&#xD;
as the evidence of its 'being illuminated. This door Charles&#xD;
pushed open, and he did not know whether to feel delighted or&#xD;
alarmed on discovering Mrs. Fox and Lucy huddled together on&#xD;
a sofa, with tearful eyes, the hopeless prey of anguish and con-&#xD;
sternation. The sound of his footsteps attracted their attention,&#xD;
and a ray of joy lit up the eye of Mrs. Fox, when she recognized&#xD;
the visitor in the light of the candle. Rising and throwing her-&#xD;
self into his arms, she cried:&#xD;
"Charlie! our good dear Charlie ! At last a person, to whom&#xD;
we poor frightened women can look for help and cbnsolation-! Oh&#xD;
Charlie! how glad I am to see you!&#xD;
Lucy joine4lin these demonstrations, but what surprised Charles&#xD;
was, that they treated his coming as something entirely natural,&#xD;
as something which might have occurred any day. Something&#xD;
unusual must have happened, and his heart shrank with fear, at&#xD;
the dreadful thought, which flitted through his brain. He had to&#xD;
muster courage, to ask the question:&#xD;
"What is the matter ladies? you are alarmed? Where are the&#xD;
other members of the family?"&#xD;
"Alas we do not know, Charlie! that is our trouble."&#xD;
"N'ot know? Mr. Fox....&#xD;
"Left us a week ago for a trip to Turin."&#xD;
"And Dolores?"&#xD;

S"Has disappeared since this morning. Our servants have been&#xD;
hunting her everywhere, but thus far without success. Imagine&#xD;
my delight on discovering your dear face, Charlie. I began to&#xD;
hope again, for you love the poor girl and I know, you will leave&#xD;
nfQ stone unturned tofind her."&#xD;
Charles was startled, but yet relieved, He, had feared some&#xD;
thing worse, and therefore taken comfort from his agreeable dis-&#xD;
appointment. Still matters looked bad enough. Dolores lost since&#xD;
morning! It was indeed fortunate, that he should have arrived&#xD;
In time to begin researches with a.reasopable prospect ~of.suC:&#xD;
cess. .But nota moment must be lost, and he led the ladies back&#xD;
to. the sofa, to extract any information, that might have the ten-.&#xD;
dency of leading him on the right track.&#xD;
"Now tell me all about it Mrs. Fox" he said, taking a seat at&#xD;
her side.&#xD;
"Alas! I know but very little. This morning Dolores started-&#xD;
on a tour of charity. Antonio, one of our servants came with a&#xD;
message from a poor sick woman, living in one of the last houses&#xD;
of the village, begging the signora, that spoke Italian to come&#xD;
andsee her, as she had matters of importance to communnicate&#xD;
to her. Dolores-you know how good she is-could not find it&#xD;
in her heart, to refuse the woman. It may be a beggar in dis-&#xD;
guise, she said; but again it may not. It shall not be said of me,&#xD;
that I refused to comfort a poor creature in her hour of death.&#xD;
With those words she went and from that moment my eyes have&#xD;
been, deprived the pleasure of resting on her dear dear form."&#xD;
"But have you not sent to the house?"&#xD;
"Of course we have.- It was found empty, with its back door&#xD;
open; and traces of, a. struggle;in the garden behind."&#xD;
Charles shuddered.&#xD;
"And Antonio?",he asked.&#xD;
"Has disappeared as well as Dolores."&#xD;
"And you 'have no idea, who can have abducted her?"&#xD;
"Not the slightest. They say, there are robbers in this country.&#xD;
and they may possibly have stolen, the child, to secure a ransom.&#xD;
I have caused it to be proclaimed all over the village, that a hand-&#xD;
some reward will be paid to any ~one, who can bring her back or&#xD;
even lead to the discovery of- her whereabouts."&#xD;
"You have done right, Mrs. Fox, and "all 1-expect of you is to&#xD;
&#xD;
take heart. Don't fret dear madam, for I-shall at once devote my&#xD;
whole strength to her recovery. But to begin atonce, I have to&#xD;
leave you-will you pardon me for this seeming rudeness ?"&#xD;
"Don't speak so Charlie. I would be the first to hurry you off,&#xD;
if your own zeal did not drive you. Go my boy, and bring her&#xD;
back to my arms, to receive the blessing of a mother. But stop,&#xD;
do you know,'she loves you. Do you know that the whole un&#xD;
fortunate affair was nothing, but the result of a mistake?"&#xD;
"I did.not, and your words make me happy; but how....&#xD;
"Never mind how, Charlie, do not now' stop 'for'an'explanation.&#xD;
The lines you read had a continuation, to the effect, that instead&#xD;
of lovingeyou,, she worshipped you. Sd, let that suffice, Charlie,&#xD;
and hasten off. I shall be comparatively tranquil, now, since I&#xD;
know you on her trail."&#xD;
Charles pressed the hands of the ladies, and after a short adieu&#xD;
left their presence. Pain and joy struggled in his soul pain on&#xD;
account of the mysterious disappearance of his love-joy because&#xD;
the sad doubt of hraendifference had for ever been dispelled from&#xD;
his soul. In this frame of mind, he hurried down the steps to the&#xD;
waer's ed, to rejoin the brigand, for he shared the idea, that&#xD;
Dolores had been kidnapped, in order to secure a ransom. Her&#xD;
ie would be safe in such an instance; but her honor!.-he trem-&#xD;
bed at the thought. Luigi knew beforehand from h&#xD;
eager step, that something was wrong, and when Charles reached&#xD;
him, he was as ready for listening, as for acting.&#xD;
"Now Luigi" the young man said in hasty tones, "if you really&#xD;
Ialue my friendship and gratitude, you have a chance to prove it.&#xD;
I have returned to my friends to learn that.the heart of Dolores&#xD;
is mine; but also that some rascal has this very morning robbed&#xD;
me of her person. Mrs. Fox thinks it was a robber and I am&#xD;
inclined to share that idea. ,Luigi, if you really are the prince&#xD;
of   se allows, you must assist me in recovering her person."&#xD;
"Of that you may rest assured, Carlo" Luigi replied "but then,&#xD;
such things.are rarely undertaken without my knowledge. I have&#xD;
my doubts about the girl's being in the hands of robbers. Come&#xD;
give me a connected account of the whole affair. I must know&#xD;
all, to be able to judge."&#xD;
Charles relatedall, he knew.&#xD;

"Antonio, you said was the scoundrel's name, that disappeared.&#xD;
with her ?" Luigi inquired.&#xD;
"So they tell me."&#xD;
"I have no doubt, it is the same fellow, that accompanied her&#xD;
the other day. He scamped off, on seeing 'me, but I noticed&#xD;
enough of the rascal's face, to set him down as a regular scamp."&#xD;
"And you have no idea, where she can be?"&#xD;
"Not yet, Carlo. Has she any enemies, who would be benefit-&#xD;
ted by her disappearance?"&#xD;
"Not to my knowledge; but stop, I may as well tell you her&#xD;
past history. She is the daughterpf the duke di Gatana, who&#xD;
had: to flee,, because he was'discovered in a-conspiracy against the&#xD;
government."&#xD;
Luigi listened. He thought he saw a ray of light penetrating&#xD;
mystery;'but he said nothiug.&#xD;
"The Duke lived an exile in America and when dying left his&#xD;
daughter in the hands of the gentleman, who educated her and&#xD;
whose family is now residing in this village."&#xD;
And you say, he has started on a tour to Turin and not been&#xD;
.heard of since his departure ?"&#xD;
"So it is."&#xD;
"Then. I understand the whole case. Indeed you would under-&#xD;
etand it as well, if it wasn't for one Or two things, of which you&#xD;
seem to be ignorant. Tell me, Carlo, you did not know, that after&#xD;
the 'peace of Villa Franca the Duke's domains were restored to&#xD;
his  fam ily?"  ...&#xD;
"Indeed I didn't. In that instance Dolorese would be the right-&#xD;
ful heiress."&#xD;
"So she would and unfortunately, the Duke, her uncle, seems&#xD;
to know it."&#xD;
"But how ? I cannot see, how in the world he should have&#xD;
gained the- knowledge."&#xD;
You dont?" Luigi said with a smile. "And yet you are so&#xD;
clever. But the fact is, we Italians are born intriguers."&#xD;
"Come, come be' quick" Charles said impatiently "we have no&#xD;
time for reflections."&#xD;
"Indeed weavee" Luigi responded rather coolly. "There is&#xD;
nothing 'like understanding. one's positIOR. Butl will explain,&#xD;
listen ; Mr. Fox by some means or others learns the actual-state&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLOiES.&#xD;
&#xD;
of affairs and he comes to Italy, to push the claims of his ward."&#xD;
"Ha! indeed!"&#xD;
"He keeps her in ignorance, because he does not wish to raise&#xD;
hopes, which he may be unable to fulfil. He rents this house-and&#xD;
starts for Turin to see the uncle Duke."&#xD;
"Do you think so?"&#xD;
"I know it" was the calm reply. "Mr. Fox reaches the capital,&#xD;
he sees the Duke and presents the case. He has papers--has he y&#xD;
not?"&#xD;
"Yes, the most conclusive documents."&#xD;
"Very.well,;the duke chafes; but, he cannot save himself and&#xD;
making a virtue of necessity, he plays the pleasant gentleman, the&#xD;
loving uncle. Mr. Fox is invited to his palace; the place of res-&#xD;
idence of the;heiress. is wormed out .of him, and while he is ca-&#xD;
joled from one amusement to another, a confidential messenger is&#xD;
dispatched to carry off the precious prize-,voila tout."&#xD;
"By St. George ! I think you are right," cried Charles, rising so&#xD;
rapidly in the little craft, as to come near upsetting it. "But to&#xD;
know the trouble and to remedy it, are two different things.' The&#xD;
hardest task is still before you."&#xD;
"Well, I don't know. It is easier for a good physician to ap-&#xD;
ply the proper medicine after a correct diagnosis, than for a poor&#xD;
one, to find the seat of the malady. Every thing depends on the&#xD;
doctor."&#xD;
"That means, you have strong hopes of recovering Dolores?"&#xD;
"Yes unless the duke has given her a pill of arsenic, or caused&#xD;
her virgin bosom to be pierced by six inches of cold steel."&#xD;
Charles shuddered.&#xD;
"He would hardly venture to go to such extremes!'&#xD;
Luigi shrugged his shoulders--he was very good at that-&#xD;
"Friend Carlo, it is hard to say what such a grandee will ven-&#xD;
ture for the sake of, rank and wealth. But let us assume the&#xD;
more desirable construction and the question arises : where has&#xD;
the Duke caused her to be secreted? Now, he has so many castles&#xD;
that that question is a very difficult one."&#xD;
"I see it is. Have you any idea?"&#xD;
"I think I have. First .I ask myself the question: how many of&#xD;
the Duke's manors are' available? next: how many are desireable?&#xD;
In that way the large number becomes considerably reduced."&#xD;
&#xD;

? -WPA&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7070-00000201"/>&#xD;
-"How many then are'available?"&#xD;
"Two or three.",&#xD;
"And desirable?"&#xD;
"Just one."&#xD;
"Ah! that does simplify our task, if you are correct in your&#xD;
conclusion, which I, am inclined to think, judging from your other&#xD;
clever deductions."&#xD;
"Thank you, Signor."&#xD;
"But where is this castle?"&#xD;
"Just one mile from the place, where- you met me this morn-&#xD;
Ing.&#xD;
"That sounds encouraging. I can hardly understand however,&#xD;
why the Duke should deem a prison desirable, which is so near&#xD;
the scene of action."&#xD;
"That makes it only more desirable in my judgment. Nobody&#xD;
would expect the'victim so near the stage, on which the outrage&#xD;
was committed,"&#xD;
"Again you are right and you expect to be able to gain access&#xD;
to this castle?"&#xD;
"Carlo, I make it a rule-and to tell you in confidence, that my&#xD;
entire success and reputation are due to this rule-I make it a&#xD;
rule, I say, to have an accomplice in every place of importanceten&#xD;
miles around. The castle in question makes no exception, and&#xD;
there is no hour of day or night, at which I could not penetrate&#xD;
into the securest vaults of that stronghold."&#xD;
"Oh thanks Luigi! thanks for the encouragement you give me.&#xD;
I shall never again rebel against your arrangement; but perhaps&#xD;
you will allow the humble question: is. there anything to delay&#xD;
our departure?"&#xD;
Luigi laughed.'&#xD;
No, Carlo," he said "there is nothing to delay it; but 'there&#xD;
is much to prompt it. 'We must recover the body of the pris-&#xD;
oner this very night. If the agent of the Duke gets only the,&#xD;
faintest hint of our intentions-adieu the prospect of'success !"&#xD;
"I am glad - to hear you speak that way, Luigi. I surely will&#xD;
be the last one, to cause delay.- Let sit your oar-mine is ready.&#xD;
Again the little craft cut the -glossy surface of the lake, this&#xD;
time faster yet than before, as if the oarsmen- felt the value of&#xD;
every second. When the keel grated on the beach they jumped -&#xD;
&#xD;
from the vessel and without taking the. trouble of securing it&#xD;
began th. ascent of the rocky shore, It was very dark now'and&#xD;
without Luigi's perfect knowledge of the ground, they, would&#xD;
never have succeeded. Thanks to his skill as a guide the&#xD;
reached the road and even entered the racine which led to L '&#xD;
hidingplace and stronghold. Here the walk became more and&#xD;
more difficult and when the rocks began to obstruct the path&#xD;
Charles declared his inability sf advancing without the tolerable&#xD;
certain prospect of breaking his neck.&#xD;
"I have thought of that, Carlo" Luigi replied. "It isn't at all&#xD;
necessary for you to climb across. You can'stayahere and act as&#xD;
sentnel and in less than 15 minutes,.'I shall join you with such&#xD;
members of the band, I can command."&#xD;
"Very well Signor !&#xD;
Luigi proceeded and the time specified had not transpired by&#xD;
several minutes, when the chieftain made his appearance with a&#xD;
long string of followers behind him. Taking Charles by the&#xD;
hand, he led him down the pass, until they reached the more open&#xD;
but less safe highway. Luigi'stopped until all his men were col-&#xD;
in a circle around him.&#xD;
"The sbirri may be on the watch yet" he said "and in that ini-&#xD;
stance we must be cautious. Don't use any firearms-in fact, we&#xD;
might as well have left them at home, for all the good they'll do&#xD;
us-but if cold steel can rid you of the vermin-use it freely.&#xD;
You. all know the castle. We are going to take it from the front&#xD;
iselmo is turnkey you know and will open, when he hears&#xD;
signal. The rest depends upon his communications. I can eas-&#xD;
ily instruct you, after I have spoken to him. Now, forward."&#xD;
ently# and in single file the band proceeded along the high-&#xD;
way until after a while a road branched off to the:left. -Thi&#xD;
ey struck and pursued for a quarter of an hour, when a mas-&#xD;
sive wall suddenly checked all further progress. Luigi extracted&#xD;
a shrill sound from a little whistle and then 'stepping back into&#xD;
the forest like his followers, he awaited the result of the signal&#xD;
.ey had to wait 15 minutes before their patience was rewarded&#xD;
Luigi had already pondered on the best way 'of forcing-an en-&#xD;
rance when all at once a creaking ir the lock of the' gate be-&#xD;
trayed the insertion of a key.. The noise then stopped again, to-&#xD;
reappear at the hinges, on which the door was all at once swung&#xD;

-ug had reached him and conversed with him in low cautious&#xD;
tones. The interview lasted about ten minutes, after which time&#xD;
Lu'i returned to his men.&#xD;
"Anselmo reports everything. favorable," he said; "and I hope&#xD;
to be able to carry the lady off without discovery. Still we must&#xD;
be cautious, and I shall place a guard at every door or side pas-&#xD;

until he is relieved by a second tap. Our parole is: "Dolores."&#xD;

'Aye, aye!"&#xD;
"Foard then! Carlo, remain at my side, here is Anselmo with&#xD;

The turnkeyfentered the door, and'thecaptain followed, tap-&#xD;

and the rest closing up, followed their leader. The distance was.&#xD;

"The e room is a double one, and the first one used as an ante-&#xD;

the others heard a voice saying :&#xD;
thWhat do you want? Can you not even allow me the rest of&#xD;
the night ?"&#xD;
Charles heard the voice and recognized it. Once more his self-&#xD;
control was on the point of giving way, but Luigi had anticipated&#xD;
rtunately checked him in time. When the turnkey ste&#xD;
ped into the room, the chieftain laid one hand lik rn   e&#xD;

and how the prisoner responded with an exclamation almost too&#xD;

gers more firmly; but the danger passed off without evil r&#xD;

but when the main road was reached without accident, Charles&#xD;
oud no lohe mabstain from expressing by his voice, how happy&#xD;
he was.&#xD;
"Dolores!"&#xD;
"Charles !"&#xD;
A question--a short response!" Two words only and yet vol&#xD;
f thoughts and feelings. They sufficed the happy couple&#xD;
for the rest of the walk. When they reached the pass, Luigi said&#xD;
to Charles :                          1foafecay.T&#xD;

"I    ot know, how it is with you across the ocean; but with&#xD;

You hear, what this man says, Dolores: will you trust our&#xD;
honor and your life into his keeping?'&#xD;
I will Charlie, for I think, he means well. Indeed I have met&#xD;
hi before this, and held him in grateful remembrance."&#xD;
"Very well then, on we go !" Charles responded, and the whole&#xD;
started up the pass. When they reached the barrier of&#xD;
rocks, the first faint rays of the sun dispelled the deep darkness, ,&#xD;
and.by the light thus gained, and the assistance of a anh  the&#xD;

CHAPTER XLII.&#xD;
A HAPPY MORNING.&#xD;
Luigi gave up his hut to Dolores and the poor girl, whohad&#xD;
gone through a sleepless night and anxious day, gladly benefited&#xD;
by the chance of sleeping a few hours under her friend's protec-&#xD;
tonhWrapped in a blanket, which Luigi had given him, he&#xD;
stretched himself before the only entranceot tehu n"  hc&#xD;
his regained-in a double sense rwegsinedtsepi&#xD;
No slumber however entered his own eyes and with his hand on&#xD;
his revolver he watched the gradual dawning of the day and the&#xD;
awakening of Dolores. The latter occurrenehpendbfr&#xD;
any of the robbers,-excepting the sentinels- e&#xD;
first interview took place in that sweet solitude, which lovers so&#xD;
 much covet. When Dolores stepped from the d  asaw h&#xD;
lyn  nthe bare ground, a faithful sentinel, she wasmvdb&#xD;
his devotion and believing him still asleep, she was on the point&#xD;
of retreating to the interior of the hut; but     -&#xD;
he showed his wakefulness and of course checked her retreat.&#xD;
"Dolores!" he cried again, springing to his feet. "I can hardi&#xD;
Sthe fact, that I am after all allowed not only to  y&#xD;
you, ut to address you in this manner. I have suffered much&#xD;
for yurehans east; but this moment, this blissful moment&#xD;
more than repays me."&#xD;
He had first seized her hand and then, becoming more and more&#xD;
assured gradually drawn her into a fervent embrace. A kiss&#xD;
sealed the union of their hearts, by which I do not want my read-&#xD;
es to understand, that it remained without numerous successors&#xD;
Not so, the contrary was the case; but the first kiss between&#xD;
young lovers has something peculiar within it. It may be com-&#xD;
pared to the breaking of the ice on swelling rivers in the time of&#xD;
spring. The fetters once taken off, the liberated waters roll on&#xD;
never ceasing waves until--the force is spent, that bore them&#xD;
on. Alas! how often is this the case in married life, The reader&#xD;
ofthis story was pained to witness an .instance of that kind in&#xD;
the experience of Mr. Fox-let me now congratulate him, tha't I&#xD;
am able to give him a sketch-merely a meagre sketch-of nobler&#xD;
ove - of love happily united after a dark and threatening tem-&#xD;
pest.&#xD;
Dolores stroked his hair from his forehead.&#xD;

"Poor Charlie!" she said witb. loving tones. "You look as if&#xD;
ou had suffered; but I assure you, the storm, tha passed over&#xD;
our devoted heads, has not left me untouched. I was sick Charle&#xD;
very sick, they tell me."'&#xD;
Ather kiss and a warm embrace were his only reply.&#xD;
now drea    'l she resumed, "that the very words, in which I&#xD;

punishment rather, than reward for having had sofromtle at&#xD;
S      my good sense and feeling? moreover for running from us all at&#xD;
such hot haste ?"&#xD;
Charles laughed. It was the first genuine laugh fr many a&#xD;
dreary day.4&#xD;
"Dont blame all on the men, my dear," he said "you women&#xD;
paint a particle better. First you attract us, the poor victims of&#xD;
your charms and when you have secured the patent. of our pro-&#xD;
tection, you become coy and deny where before you always pro-&#xD;
mised."&#xD;
"That sounds serious," Dolores answered; "and I begin to fear,&#xD;
that there is no evasion from this trying task.' '&#xD;
"Indeed there isn't, but if my shutting both my eyes will in any,&#xD;
way facilitate the confession, you are welcome to so much of an&#xD;
indulgence."&#xD;
"Well, shut your eyes then; tho' I am afraid, you. can hear well&#xD;
enough with your ears for tha+ matter."&#xD;
'bo on Dol!"                                         .&#xD;
"So you will have no mercy on poor me? Well listen then: I&#xD;
stated, that I did not love you, because I worshipped you, ea&#xD;
was pretty sure of committing idolatry with my eyes open. Thee&#xD;
now ! I can never after this hold up my head against you;-,e&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
05&#xD;
&#xD;
cause if I tell you, that for some naughtiness or other I shall love&#xD;
you less, you will not believe me."&#xD;
"Are yo.u through now, Dol?"'&#xD;
"Yes Charles I am, but don't open your eyes just yet, for.I am&#xD;
still feeling the burning blush on my cheeks."&#xD;
"But I think, that blush must be becoming."&#xD;
"If you think so, I shall lay on my rouge ever so thick here-&#xD;
yafter."k hre&#xD;
"Just as you please; but may I open my eyes now? I can hot&#xD;
stand this abstinence much louger."&#xD;
"It is necessary Charlie; it will teach you, to shut your eyes to&#xD;
my faults hereafter."&#xD;
"Oh Dol, there is plenty time for that, when you get some. At&#xD;
present I much prefer to look at your perfection. Just think, how&#xD;
long I have been deprived the pleasure of looking at you at all."&#xD;
"Yes, that is true Charlie; I see I have been rather selfish, for&#xD;
I have denied you a pleasure, which I have been enjoying all the&#xD;
time. You may open your eyes to their double capacity now, to&#xD;
make up for lost time."&#xD;
"Thank you Dol; I think that will do, especially since I have&#xD;
been squinting at you just a little bit-a natural defect in my&#xD;
right eye."&#xD;
So they jested and laughed, as if they had been separated but&#xD;
one short day, instead of many months. The reader finds it&#xD;
strange maybe, but if he does, he can not possibly be a good&#xD;
judge of human nature. Our deepest emotions are least apt to&#xD;
reach the surface. The mighty Niagara does his mighty leap into&#xD;
a precipice and produces only mist as the result. We sometimes&#xD;
weep with joy and again laugh with despair. Great passions are&#xD;
apt to make silent, and railleries are often used to smooth the way&#xD;
to mutual understandings.&#xD;
So with Charles and Dolores. While they indulged in their in-&#xD;
nocent exchange of badinage, they were both of them inexpres-&#xD;
sibly happy. They would rather not have said anything at all to-&#xD;
one another; but sitting hand in hand, face to face, would have&#xD;
liked to read from each other's eye the confession of love and hap-&#xD;
piness. But the heart always labors under a diffidence, when first&#xD;
the consciousness of mutual affection dawns within it, and many&#xD;
innocent artifices are resorted to. to break the ice, and khad into a&#xD;

natural even channel the emotions, which make the heart beat.&#xD;
wildly against the breast, and threaten to upset all the habits and&#xD;
feelings of our former life.&#xD;
Gradually however another chord of their hearts was struck&#xD;
They related to each other the sad experience of their separation&#xD;
and approaching the present time, indulged in speculations of&#xD;
what the future would bring.&#xD;
"By the bye, Dol, did Mr. Fox ever intimate any special reason.&#xD;
for visiting Italy?" Charles inquired in the course of their con-&#xD;
versation.&#xD;
"No Charles, but he dropped mysterious hints; especially on&#xD;
hi deatr   'o u~n     I shouldn't wonder, if he were hunting&#xD;
for some relatives of mine, intending to surprise me with their&#xD;
discovery and not before."&#xD;
"Sagacious as ever, Dol, only you didn't hittthe nail in the&#xD;
tre. Under other circumstances I should not spoil his calcula-&#xD;
tion by informing you; but as matters stand, it is my imperious.&#xD;
duty. Say Dol, have you any idea, from whose hands we liberated&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"No Charles, I had no chance to find out. When they seized&#xD;
me yesterday in the hut, to which they had allured me under false&#xD;
pretenses, they put a veil over my face and throwing me into a.&#xD;
carriage, drove away at a great speed. We continued on the way&#xD;
all day and a portion of the night, and when I now consider the&#xD;
short distance from this place to the castle across the lake, I can-&#xD;
not help thinking, that they have taken me here and there in&#xD;
order to create in me the thought, that I was far away from my&#xD;
people and consequently entirely in the power of my captors&#xD;
You see therefore, that I had no chance in forming any guess at&#xD;
their character. Indeed I sometimes thought, that theylwere rob-&#xD;
bhers and I even wronged our good host by believing him to be&#xD;
implicated in the attempt;obut, although I am now fully con.&#xD;
vneed of his innocence, I am as much at a loss, to divine the.&#xD;
character -of my kidnappers, as ever."&#xD;
"I do not wonder Dol. Mrs. Fox entertained the same thought.&#xD;
The truth is too disgusting to entertain, at least for an American&#xD;
mind; although such things are common enough here, if what&#xD;
Luigi says, is true."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
407&#xD;
&#xD;
"But Charlie, what do you mean? You seem to wish to pre-&#xD;
pare me for something horrible."&#xD;
"Indeed I do; or don't you think it horrible, that an uncle&#xD;
should cause his brother's child to be kidiiapp ed, as soon as he&#xD;
learns of her existence and arrival?"&#xD;
"My uncle! my father's brother !"&#xD;
"Nobody else. It was from the castle of the Duke di Gatana&#xD;
that we liberated you."&#xD;
Dolores hung her head.&#xD;
"Oh, my glorious anticipations !" she crisd "where are they?&#xD;
The stranger's land has nursed and educated me and my native&#xD;
country puts the adder in my way, to sting my foot, in crossing&#xD;
. er .byryro soingCmrfoo,                    i  rsig&#xD;
its very border.. Come Charlie, let us flee a country, where that&#xD;
is possible! Let us return to America where people under a cold&#xD;
surface preserve a warm and feeling heart !"&#xD;
"I have no objection to that, Dolores; indeed it is my wish that&#xD;
it should be done;-btonteohY&#xD;
but on the other hand I must caution you, not&#xD;
to coademnn this land for the meanness of an individual. You re-&#xD;
collect that in America you found bad persons on your path of&#xD;
life, as well as virtuous ones and if you draw the balance, it is&#xD;
very doubtful which side will preponderate."&#xD;
"You may be right, Charlie ; but what object could the Duke&#xD;
have had, to thus persecute me ?"&#xD;
"Can you not guess Dolores? By the peace of Villa Franca&#xD;
the domains of your father have been restored -to your famil&#xD;
and you being the rightful heir, the Duke naturally-pardon me,&#xD;
I meant unnaturally---tried to get you in his possession."&#xD;
"Ah, now I understand many things, which were a mystery to&#xD;
me before. My father heard of this at home and planned the&#xD;
trip, to secure my claims."&#xD;
"At least I think so. Maybe he wished at the same time to&#xD;
improve your health and quicken our reunion.&#xD;
"Good dear father. But I do not covet wealth and rank, that&#xD;
is associated with such danger. If you love me Charles, let us&#xD;
return toMaine, where nature is cold, but the hearts of the peo&#xD;
ple are warm."&#xD;
"You express my sentiments, Dol; but just at present we can-&#xD;
not well depart. You forget, that Mr. Fox has not yet returned&#xD;

from Turin. I should not wonder much, if he too was in the&#xD;
power of the Duke."&#xD;
"Yes, indeed! His journey had escaped me; but it is no won-&#xD;
der Charlie. The last few days have stormed over me so wildly&#xD;
and have filled me with so many conflicting feelings, that it is but&#xD;
natural to get confused. So you think, that father went to see&#xD;
the Duke?"&#xD;
"Nosdoubt about it Dol and in his innocence, Mr. Fox betrayed&#xD;
the secret of your place of residence."&#xD;
"But what is to be done Charlie? I must confess, I am at a&#xD;
loss, to conceive a plan, that will at all answer the purpose."&#xD;
"Well I have one, Dol, that I think will answer This morning&#xD;
while watching on the sill or the hut, I had plenty time to think&#xD;
and improving my opportunity I managed to concoct a plan, that&#xD;
will at once end our dilemma and changing us from the agressed&#xD;
into the party that's aggressing, sec ure us the advantages of the&#xD;
latter."&#xD;
"Ah Charlie, you contemplate new struggles then. If my voice&#xD;
is heard, we shall embark without delay and leave a country,&#xD;
where my nearest relatives seek my person and maybe my life, for&#xD;
the sake of miserable lucre."&#xD;
"Dolores confide in me. My plan will not in the least expose&#xD;
vou. I meant to send a trusty messenger to the castle this morn-&#xD;
ing, with a note to the effect, that you are safe and under my pro-_&#xD;
tection; but that the ill-will of a powerful enemy of your family&#xD;
makes it unsafe for you or me to return to the castle. I next&#xD;
mean to state, that I guess the, whereabouts of Mr. Fox and re-,&#xD;
quest them to break up their household, and depart for Turin as&#xD;
soon as possible. There they must report at once at the Ameri-&#xD;
can Minister's, and leave word where we may find them or vice&#xD;
versa. What do you think of this ?"&#xD;
"It is well enough as far as they are concerned; but what are&#xD;
we to do?"&#xD;
"I am coming to that presently. Luigi will most likely pro-&#xD;
pose, that you shall remain in his protection, while I go to Turin&#xD;
and look for your father....&#xD;
He was going to proceed; but Dolores nestled to his side with&#xD;
such a look of alarm and prayerful persuasion, that he checked&#xD;
himself, saying:&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       409&#xD;
"Fear nothing dearest, I havn't the slightest notion, to forsake&#xD;
you. Not, that I did not trust Luigi; but no man is master of&#xD;
his feelings and our host, now a noble fellow, might by a sudden&#xD;
passion for you be changed into our enemy. Indeed I fear you&#xD;
have already made a deeper impression on his heart, than is good&#xD;
for his tranquility and the sooner you quit his company, .the bet-&#xD;
ter for all of us. My plan was this. We stay here until dark&#xD;
this evening and then proceed under the shelter of the night to&#xD;
the next town, which is only a few miles distant. There we pro-&#xD;
cure a carriage that takes us to the nearest railroad station and&#xD;
once on an express train for the Capital, any and every cause for&#xD;
fear is at an end. But, in order to escape annoyance on the road,&#xD;
it will be best for you to assume male dresses. Luigi has a vari-&#xD;
ety of clothes, I see, and will no doubt furnish us with a suit,&#xD;
which will answer the purpose. What do you think of plan No 2?"&#xD;
"It is well enough, though I do not like the idea of assuming&#xD;
the garb of your sex?"&#xD;
"I deem it essential to your safety."&#xD;
"Then I shall submit;. but there the men are getting awake&#xD;
now; come let me retire into .the hut; I dislike so much to meet&#xD;
their coarse glances."&#xD;
Dolores was right; A general stir became visible in the camp&#xD;
and Charles therefore granted her reasonable request. She had&#xD;
hardly retired, when Luigi came up and bidding our friend a good&#xD;
morning, congratulated him on* the safe recovery of his lady.&#xD;
Charles seized and warmly shook his hand.&#xD;
"Luigi," he said "you have done me a service, for which I can&#xD;
never forget you. If you.had saved .my life, I should not be un.&#xD;
der half the obligation as now. I cannot bear the thought of&#xD;
leaving you here, exposed to the dangers of your calling aind the&#xD;
communion of the low and degraded. I shall write to you on&#xD;
reaching the Capital-can you give me an address, to which I&#xD;
may direct my letters?"&#xD;
"I can, Carlo, just let me write it in your memorandum-book.&#xD;
So if you write to that address, you may be sure that I shall get&#xD;
your letter. But am I from what you say, to understand, that you&#xD;
intend to leave me soon?"&#xD;
"Yes, Signor Luigi, we mean to leave this evening. Can you&#xD;
sell me a suit of man's clothing, that will fit Dolores? I think,&#xD;

e&#xD;
&#xD;
Dear Madam!&#xD;
Allow me to congratulate you on the safe recovery of your&#xD;
daughter. She is with me now, sending her, love to you and&#xD;
Lucy; but she cannot return to the castle on account of the en-&#xD;
mity of a powerful relative, who' seeks her destruction, in order&#xD;
to get rid of her claims to his property. I am going to take her&#xD;
in disguise to the capital, to which place I request you to depart&#xD;
without delay. Do not stop to sell, what you cannot take along;&#xD;
it is better to sacrifice, than to delay. Depart at once with Lucy&#xD;
and on arriving at Turin call at the American Ministry. There&#xD;
you will receive word from your friend&#xD;
CHARLEs Fuc.s.&#xD;
To this Dolores added a P. S. which ran as follows:&#xD;
Dear Mother and Sister!&#xD;
Rest easy on my account. I am well and in good spirits. This&#xD;
evening Charles and I are going to leave for Turin, to join father.&#xD;
Follow as soon as you can - .but inform none of your intentions-&#xD;
your daughter&#xD;

that such disguise will save her from annoyance, until she'reaches&#xD;
Turin."&#xD;
"Yes, Carlo, I have the suit of a page, which my men took on&#xD;
one occasion from the surplus of a rich family. You need not&#xD;
tell the lady, how I came by it."&#xD;
"I certainly will not. But I have more favors to ask: can you&#xD;
send a trusty fellow with a note of mine to the castle?"&#xD;
"Of course I can. Write your note and I guarantee its safe de-&#xD;
livery in a couple of hours."&#xD;
"Thank you. You are a pearl of a brigand; but you are more&#xD;
valuable for better purposes. Give me your hand Luigi, that you&#xD;
will try your best, to tear yourself away from this degrading neigh-&#xD;
borhood and pursuit."&#xD;
Luigi's eye was moist, when he laid his hand intothat of Charles&#xD;
with a firm pressure. That pressure was all his answer. Charles&#xD;
went into the hut and taking from his small valise paper, ink and&#xD;
pen, wrote the following note:&#xD;
Luigi's camp, Aug. 9th, 1859.&#xD;
Mrs.,C. Fox.&#xD;
&#xD;
This note was put into an envelope and then with out anyad-&#xD;
dress handed to Luigi. The captain picked a lad of some 15&#xD;
years with handsome countenance and intelligent eyes and gave&#xD;
him the necessary instructions.&#xD;
"You answer for the letter with your life, Bernardo."&#xD;
The lad nodded and hiding the letter in a leatherpocket on&#xD;
his breast, shot away from the fort with the agility and quick-&#xD;
ness of a spaniel.&#xD;
The day wore away slowly and Dolores thought, it would never&#xD;
end. Luigi treated her with great deference and her fare was not.&#xD;
only good but even excellent; but she could not rid herself of a.&#xD;
certain feeling of fear and insecurity on account of the promis-&#xD;
cuous society, she was campelled to share. If she had under-&#xD;
stood these people better, she would have set aside her unneces-&#xD;
sary anxiety. She would have known then, that to them the&#xD;
laws of hospitality are sacred and that, instead of having any de-&#xD;
sire of harming her, 'each and all of them would have laid down&#xD;
their lives, sooner than allow her foes to injure her. When the&#xD;
afternoon wore away, she retired to the hut with the suit, which&#xD;
Luigi had furnished her and half an hour afterwards returned as&#xD;
handsome a lad, as the sun ever shone upon. The black velvet&#xD;
pants and jacket showed her symmetrical body to a great advan-&#xD;
tage and the Kossuth hat and top boots gave her an air of mis-&#xD;
chiveous sauciness, which she was far from feeling. She blushed&#xD;
deeply on meeting the admiring glance of Charles and Luigi.&#xD;
"Don't Iook that way on me: Charlie,"n she said with an embar&#xD;
rassed smile, "or I'll never come out to you."&#xD;
"That would be a great blessing to all the maidens of this land.&#xD;
Dear me, what bleeding hearts you'll leave on the track on your&#xD;
journey!"&#xD;
"Don't make fun of me, Charles. I tell you, I feel serious&#xD;
enough."&#xD;
"So much more reason, Dol, to cheer you up. But what did&#xD;
you do with all your splendid curls? I hope you did not cut&#xD;
them."&#xD;
Instead of an answer, she lifted her hat and displayed a narrow&#xD;
ribbon by means of which she had ingeniously shortened her hair,&#xD;
without cutting it.&#xD;
"That will do very well; but now Luigi tell me; can you pro-&#xD;
&#xD;

cure us a carriage, to take us to the railroad station ? Perhaps&#xD;
the police are still on the watch, and I would not for the world&#xD;
fall in their clutches now."&#xD;
"Of course, you must not. Fortunately I have my connections&#xD;
and I think I can manage to procure, what you want. I shall ac-&#xD;
company you myself as far as Canti; but still it will be better to&#xD;
send somebody in advance, to prevent unnecessary delay."&#xD;
He looked around, as if he was reflecting in his mind, whom he&#xD;
had better send., At last his eye rested on a young man of clever&#xD;
looks, and beckonirg him, gave him the necessary instructions in&#xD;
an undertone.. Luigi evidently kept good discipline ; for the man&#xD;
showed as ready and even as cheerful an obedience as the first&#xD;
messenger. He nodded and taking the direction of the only out-&#xD;
let disappeared from sight.&#xD;
An hour afterwards Luigi deemed it late and dark enough, to&#xD;
begin the intended expedition. He assisted Dolores with respect-&#xD;
ful assiduity, in climbing over the rocks and soon the trio des-&#xD;
cended the pass, this time-as Dolores -sincerely hoped-for the&#xD;
last time. When they reached the road, they struck the right&#xD;
hand direction, thus going over ground familiar to Charles, as he&#xD;
had come that way only two days ago. Still the company of.&#xD;
Luigi was welcome, even necessary, as darkness had now set in&#xD;
and several crossroads made it difficult for a stranger to keep the&#xD;
right direction. After walking about three or four miles, they&#xD;
reached the place which Luigi had called Canti. He stopped his&#xD;
companions a few hundi ed steps from the first house.&#xD;
"Wait here a minute, I had better reconnoitre. Some voice&#xD;
within me warns me, that something is wrong. Step into these&#xD;
bushes and do not stir until I return."&#xD;
With these words he left them and it was a full half hour before&#xD;
he returned.&#xD;
"I thank the Holy Virgin,- for inspir.ng me with caution," he&#xD;
said on reaching them. "If I had suffered you to proceed, you&#xD;
would now be in the hands of the magistrates. They have made,&#xD;
you out a fellow even more terrible than myself and your case&#xD;
would have been desperate, if they had caught you."&#xD;
Dolores drew nearer to her friend as if she wanted to protect&#xD;
him. Luigi saw the motion.-&#xD;
"Fear nothing, Signora. Thanks to my foreboding, every thing&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       43'&#xD;
is safe now. My messenger was cunning enough to elude the grip&#xD;
of these 'cerberusses and has caused a one horse carriage to leave&#xD;
the place and wait for us on the other side. But we have to make&#xD;
the circuit of this town and 1 fear Signora will be much fatigued&#xD;
before she reaches the carriage."&#xD;
"Never mind me !" Dolores said so cheerfully, that Luigi with-&#xD;
out further parley led the way. The road was by no means pleas-&#xD;
ant, or rather there was no road at all. Fences, fields and even&#xD;
ditches had to be traversed and sometimes it was necessary for-&#xD;
Dolores to lean on the arms of both her companions, in order to&#xD;
overcome the obstacles in her way. It was well, that her feet&#xD;
were protected by the page's boots;. for they prevented at least.&#xD;
the moisture from penetrating to her feet. When they at last&#xD;
reached the road on the other side of the town, the poor girl was&#xD;
very much fatigued and never in all her past experience, had she&#xD;
felt such a great relief and pleasant sensations on entering a car-&#xD;
riage, as on that occasion. She felt too grateful for Luigi's ser-&#xD;
vices however to forget to thank him. Reaching her hand to him&#xD;
from the carriage, she said:&#xD;
"Signor Luigi, this is not the place nor the time, to thank you.&#xD;
join my entreaties to those of Charles-give us an opportunity&#xD;
of seeing you again and showing by our actions, how much we&#xD;
appreciate your generous conduct."&#xD;
Luigi was too deeply moved, to reply in words. He pressed&#xD;
his lips upon the white hand lying in his and then relinquished it&#xD;
Then turning to Charles he drew him into a long and fervent em-&#xD;
brace.&#xD;
"The Holy Virgin keep you,'' he whispered and withdrawing'&#xD;
with hurried steps, disappeared in the darkness. Charles gained&#xD;
his seat beside Dolores and the driver cracking his whip, set the&#xD;
vehicle in motion. The parting from their tried friend made the&#xD;
young couple inclined to silence.&#xD;
I cannot bear the thought of leaving the noble fellow to his&#xD;
fate. He deserves an effort to draw him from his forlorn condi-&#xD;
tion and I shall make it."&#xD;
A pressure of Dolores' hand assured him of her sympathy.&#xD;
hey talked about the brigand's noble qualities and liow they-&#xD;
might execute their generous intentions. Hour after hour wore-&#xD;
away and when the first streaks of light appeared in the eastern&#xD;

-sky, the carriage reached the railroad station. Obedient to his&#xD;
instructions the driver stopped before the place and on foot&#xD;
Charles and Dolores completed the short remainder of their jour-&#xD;

CHAPTER XLIII.&#xD;
A DUKE cORNERED.&#xD;
Mr. Fox was walking up and down his room. He was resth his&#xD;
and nervous-no wonder! for he had been a full week wit hi&#xD;
grace the Duke and yet he saw no evidence of that gentlemen's&#xD;
getting ready, to join him in a trip to the Lago di Como.&#xD;
excuses of his Grace however were so numerous and his sorrow&#xD;
at being detained seemingly so sincere, that Mr. Fox rather pitied&#xD;
than blamed him and tried to bear the delay with becoming pat-&#xD;
ience. Yet he was restless and nervous on the occassion of. our&#xD;
Visit at his quarters and even revolving in his mind the exped-&#xD;
iency of starting without the Duke, when all at once a knock at&#xD;
his door engaged his attention and drew his thoughts into a dif-&#xD;
ferent channel. He went and opened, but the sight which met&#xD;
his gaze, was to unexpected that he started back.&#xD;
"Charlie! is it possible! my dear Charlie in person!"&#xD;
He might have continued his exclamations, if Charles had not&#xD;
cautioned him with a "pist!" The young man was particular in&#xD;
shtigtedo and securing it with a bolt inside and only&#xD;
when this task wasaperformed he turned around and extending&#xD;
his hand to Mr. Fox, said with a smile :&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am glad, to see myself so welcome; but you would, do well&#xD;
to express yonr gratification in a more guarded manner."&#xD;
"Why so' Charlie? why so? I don't know at which to wonder&#xD;
most, your unexpected appearance here or the guarded manner of&#xD;
your entrance. Why, my boy, don't you know, that we are in the&#xD;
house of Dolores' uncle, the Duke?"&#xD;
"I have an  accurate knowledge of that fact, Mr. Fox, and my&#xD;
lprecaution is based on that very knowledge."&#xD;
Mr. Fox was stupified.&#xD;
"What do you mean, Charlie? I (1 not understand;von?"&#xD;
"I mean that you have heen fearfully duped, Sir."&#xD;
'"Duped, Charlie? that cannot be."&#xD;
"It can be, because it is. Tell me, Sir: does the Duke not re-&#xD;
tard your departure from day to day?"&#xD;
"He does, because he wants to accompany me and cannot dis-&#xD;
engage himself."&#xD;
"I assure, you, he has no such desire. Did it never strike you,&#xD;
that he might merely play a game and keep you here, in order to&#xD;
prevent you from crossing his purposes?"&#xD;
"No Charlie, that thought never occurred to me; but now since&#xD;
you mention it, his manoeuvres assume a suspicious aspect. What&#xD;
made you ask that question?"&#xD;
"The knowledge of the Duke's intentio'i. Did he not learn&#xD;
from you the whereabouts of Dolores?"&#xD;
"I think he did" Mr. Fox replied, with evident alarm&#xD;
"Well, he benefited by that.knowledge and stole her from the&#xD;
castle on the lakeshore."&#xD;
Mr. Fox stepped back with a look of constrnation.&#xD;
"You are joking, Charlie, tell me, that you are joking boy."&#xD;
"I never was more earnest in my life, Sir."&#xD;
"And I am staying here day after day, wasting my time like a&#xD;
fool. But wait Mr. Duke, you'll shall pay for this. Come Charlie,&#xD;
let us go to the American embassy, to the police, the king! Let&#xD;
us sekwetera.mseabeean&#xD;
S      see whether a miserable grandee can thus abuse an American&#xD;
citizen with impunity."&#xD;
Theworthy mani ran for his hat and would have shot from the&#xD;
room in hot haste, if Charles had not retained him~ forcibly.&#xD;
"Mr. Fox" he said, "your haste would only spoil, what has not&#xD;

in:time to save her, but it was a narrow escape I assure you."&#xD;
"Why did you not tell me all at once, you wicked fellow?" Mr-&#xD;
Fg                     "Thank God for that timely interfer-&#xD;
ence. But come,"let us leave this hotbed of treason and iniquity&#xD;
without delay. Not another night will I sleep under this roof!&#xD;
"Neither you shall; but I repeat, that hurry is more apt to in-&#xD;

ace before night. Just now I want you to sit down, and listen,&#xD;
to all the many things I have to tell you."&#xD;
"Welt, fire away, boy" Mr. Fox replied, taking a seat, but.&#xD;
chafing all the while like a chained lion.&#xD;
Charles began his tale and before long Mr. Fox became so in-&#xD;
terested, that he even forgot that he had been impatient. He-&#xD;
listened with breathless suspense to the recital of his daughter's&#xD;
narrow escape and when Charles had done, he shook his head-&#xD;
and said :&#xD;
"They say babies have their guardian angels, but I now perl&#xD;
ceive, that boobies have as well. I am a booby, Charlie, a dolt.&#xD;
and you my guardian angel. Providence has pity on mystupid&#xD;
head and. sends you on my track, to correct my blunders.&#xD;
Charles, what an ass have I made of myself!"&#xD;
"Now Mr. Fox I cannot consent to listen to any such disres-&#xD;
pectful language bearing upon a certain gentleman I highly es-&#xD;
teem and love. You will oblige me by discontinuing it at once.&#xD;
Have you a right, to call yourself ugly names, because in the&#xD;
goodness of your heart yo u have been deceived by an arrant,&#xD;

"That's right, smooth it up my boy, so that r can bear looking&#xD;
in a mirror again. Goodness of heart! yes indeed' stupidity of&#xD;

"No Sir, I do believe, that I or any other man would not have,&#xD;
fared any better."&#xD;
"Yes you would; you would have smelled the rat ten steps.&#xD;
ahead."l&#xD;
"I thank you in the name of my nasal organ',. Charles replied&#xD;
indulging in a moderate laugh. "But now stop abusing yourself;,&#xD;
we can use the time for something better,"&#xD;
"Very well, my boy, I cave'mn. I am not, fit for anything bu&#xD;

"Ally way, you pleaseSir; if we only accomplish our purpose.&#xD;
Dolores has become much disgusted at her relations in consequence&#xD;
of this "coup" and desires nothing better, than to return to Amer-&#xD;

"Cannot be done, Sir! can not be thought f!"&#xD;
claimed; "what! vacate the field in the face of such knavish con-&#xD;
duct? No indeed; I mean to show the Duke that anAvican&#xD;
gentlman anno be rifldtwiht'an American&#xD;
gentleman cannot be trifled with, if he is ever so much of a dolt."&#xD;
"Now don't Sir," Charles said intreatingly; "but as regards&#xD;
your intentions, they meet my approbation. It is our duty to&#xD;
preserve Dolores' claims even against her wysh  and  duty to&#xD;
opinion, that the lawless conduct of her uncle has given the game&#xD;

mit no blunders."&#xD;
"But we will if I am concerned in it, Charlie. Do me the fa-&#xD;
vor to leave me entirely out of the question."&#xD;
"Your duties will be neither difficult nor ardent. 'First I want&#xD;
you to go to the Embassy, where Dolores will be delighted to re-&#xD;
ceive you."&#xD;
"That step meets my hearty appreciation."&#xD;
"Next to that, I want you to consult the minister, as to a pro-&#xD;
per place of residence in the neighborhood of his hotel."&#xD;
"That is not very difficult either."&#xD;
"Thirdly I want you to look out for Mrs. Fox and Lucy and&#xD;
take care of them. They will call at the Embassy, you recollect."&#xD;
Agreed; what else?"&#xD;
"Nothing Mr. Fox, except to hold yourself in readiness for any&#xD;
new developments, and keep at home as much as    orany&#xD;

Mr. Fox took his hat.&#xD;
"I like that programme Charlie," he said; "and 1 It&#xD;

head is swimming as it is, in consequence of all the stuff, that&#xD;
has been crammed into it."&#xD;
He opened the door and slipped silently down stairs, as if he&#xD;
feared, to be stopped before reaching the portal. But nobody&#xD;
made any signs, to intercept his exit-the Duke had evidently not&#xD;
heard from his agent yet-and having reached the street he in-&#xD;
quired for the American Embassy, and started ,towards it with&#xD;
haste, as if a spectre was at his heels.&#xD;
We mbust let him go and return to Charles as the person acting&#xD;
just now the principal role. Having waited long enough for Mr.&#xD;
Fox to reach the street, he rang the bell and told the entering&#xD;
servant to take his coinpliments to the Duke and that Mr. Fox&#xD;
would like to pay his attention to his Grace.&#xD;
The servant looked so stupefied on seeing a new face in that&#xD;
room, that Charles thought best to explain.&#xD;
"I am Mr. Fox jr.," he said; "but you need not mention that&#xD;
to his Grace-I shall explain myself."&#xD;
The servant withdrew an'd five minutes afterwards returned with&#xD;
the message, that the, Duke would be happy, to receive Mr. Foggs,&#xD;
Charles followed the man and begged him, to show him the&#xD;
Duke's room. On reaching the ante-chamber, the servant on duty&#xD;
was as astonished as his comrade had been. He stepped before the&#xD;
curtained door, as if he meant, to stop the advance of the stranger.&#xD;
"The Duke expects me," Charles addressed him. -'I am Mr.&#xD;
Fox junior."&#xD;
The servant seemed still doubtful as to the propriety of admit-&#xD;
ting him; but the visitor moved with so much assurance and&#xD;
elegance, that he was afraid to offend him by still detaining him.&#xD;
Opening the door, he said:&#xD;
"Signor Foggs, jr."&#xD;
The last word made the Duke raise his head in wonderment&#xD;
and when he saw a perfect stranger entering his apartment, he&#xD;
started up in surprise and seemed much inclined to call his ser-&#xD;
vants for the purpose of ejecting a man, that had secured an en-&#xD;
trance by false pretences. But the polite bow and noble appear-&#xD;
ance of the young man made him hesitate.&#xD;
"What does this- signify?" he asked rather sharply. "I ex-&#xD;
pected a certain, Mr. Foggs, and must justly wonder -at seeing a&#xD;
stranger enter my room instead."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES..&#xD;
&#xD;
anYou see r Fox before you. My name is Charles Fuchs&#xD;
s just now engaged begs your Grace, to&#xD;
accept me as his representative."&#xD;
The duke did not seem to be much assured by this reply. What&#xD;
id his change signify? Did the stranger speak the truth? and&#xD;
if he did, would the Duke gain mucir by the change? Their&#xD;
a certainasomething in that young man's eye, which told he&#xD;
,      might not be very safe, to trifle with him. He th&#xD;
foreslooked at Charles without saying a word; but if he medta-&#xD;
rong measures against the intruder, Charles spoiled his cal-&#xD;
culations, by resuming in a tone of great politeness:&#xD;
"Your Grace need fear nothing from my person and if you will&#xD;
yourself the favor of a short interview, you can soon convince&#xD;
yourself of the correctness of my statement."&#xD;
The young man certainly did not look like an assassin; so the&#xD;
Duke thought, there could be no great risk in granting his e&#xD;
quest.                          -&#xD;
"Take a seat, then, Signor" he replied, "I&#xD;
the explanation of the qui pro quo."&#xD;
Charles took a chair.&#xD;
"In-order not to occupy your Grace's time lon  th&#xD;
scary" he said, "I'll enter into the subject of my call without any&#xD;
preface. I am authorized by Mr. Fox and Miss Dolores di Ga-&#xD;
tana, to enteriuto any amicable settlement of that ladies claims&#xD;
your Grace may desire to make."s&#xD;
The Duke winced under these words. He saw at once that he&#xD;
had a different person to deal with. This man  ont thatne&#xD;
For a moment he was seriously alarmed, but recollecting a certain&#xD;
dispatch he had received, which was signed "Giacomo" and can&#xD;
tained the statement, that "every thing was right" he  con-&#xD;
spirits and entered without delay upon the executiounrosed his&#xD;
which as he thought, would crush any further aspirations of these&#xD;
people in the bud.&#xD;
"Amicable settlement?" he asked, laying a good portion f d&#xD;
vision in his words. "Indeed Sir, I am getting tiredof this farce.&#xD;
On inquiry I have learned, that the party, whose interest&#xD;
pretend to advocate--I mean a certain lady pretending to be my&#xD;
niece---does only exist in imagination."&#xD;
Now the Duke expected to see the young stranger fire up and&#xD;

use insulting language, thus furnishing him with an excuse to have-&#xD;
him ejected from the palace. Being in possession of thedeiraus&#xD;
he would after that brand all their claims as attempts of defraud-&#xD;
ing him out of his possessions. The disappearance of the girl&#xD;
he would interpret as a measure on their part, to cast a shadow.&#xD;
on his reputation and use it as a proof in hisfavor of the unten-&#xD;
ableness of their position. They might perhaps annoy him a lit-&#xD;
ble; ut what could they do without the girl? It was more than&#xD;
likely that they would desist, as soon as they would learn of her&#xD;
disappearance.&#xD;
These were th Duke's calculations, and his present conduct&#xD;

his reply, instead of a using the passion of the visitor, had only&#xD;
the effect of exciting his  th. Indeed Charles smiled; he smiled&#xD;
as strongly, as he could, without overstepping the borders of&#xD;
god breedin'g.-Some persons might have styled his smile a.&#xD;

laugh.--Now he smile,       1     aok    n  ial because ,&#xD;
tion ; because he read in his soul as in abook; and finally because&#xD;
he enjoyed the thought of driving that rogue of high rank from&#xD;
position to position, until nothing but an unconditional surrender&#xD;
would be left. He only smiled a moment though-the time for&#xD;
the struggle had arrived.&#xD;
"Sir Duke" he said with a low voice looking at the same time&#xD;
around the room, as if he wanted to see, whether any uncalled,&#xD;
for ears were listenimg, "if you would accept my advise, you&#xD;
would not stand on ground, which is wholly untenable."&#xD;
"Thankyou,sdinowr,forthat advise" the Duke said with freez--&#xD;
ing coldness "but I am in the habit of taking my own counsel."&#xD;
Charles shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
"Perhaps you will change your tactics, after receiving certain&#xD;
information. You are, notthe only person receiving telegraphic&#xD;
dispatches. That glorious institution,-the pride of our age-&#xD;
is a common institution, thank God."&#xD;
He stopped. He wanted to crush the Duke by inches. That&#xD;
was cruel no doubt; but he meant to be cruel, because he thought&#xD;
that crhe mnobfr him deserved punishment. He looked at.&#xD;
his victim and saw at once, that his arrow had hit the markt&#xD;
the Duke had got a shad, paler and he did not reply-that&#xD;
was proof beyond a doubt.&#xD;

DOLORES.                      421&#xD;
"Your dispatch told you, that all wa1 right" he continued&#xD;
"'but mine is ofaa later date you see, and tells me that all is&#xD;
'wrong -.-that is as far ar you are concerned."&#xD;
The Duke felt, that the stranger played with him, as the cat&#xD;
with the mouse and he made a powerful effort to free himself&#xD;
from that keen sarcastic look, those sharp, biting words. He&#xD;
struggled hard and he failed. Charles saw him collapse and feel-&#xD;
mg a touch of pity he hastened his operations.&#xD;
"I'll not speak in riddles, Signor," he resumed. "I'll tell ou&#xD;
plainly, that the prisoner has been rescued from your castle on&#xD;
the lake. I'll tell you plainly, that she is now in this city, that it&#xD;
would cost us but an hour, to reach the court and whisper into&#xD;
the king's ear a tale of shame and treachery. After this state-&#xD;
nent, which your stubbornness compelled me to make, I repeat&#xD;
my original question : Is your Grace inclined, to make an amica-&#xD;
ble settlement?"&#xD;
The Duke all the time felt a keen torment, worse than which&#xD;
the doomed spirits cannot suffer; but these very tortures bred&#xD;
thoughts within his mind also worthy of demoniac spirits. Could&#xD;
he possibly secure this daring person, who outraged him in the&#xD;
very privacy of his sanctum? Could he command some trusty&#xD;
followers amongst his servants, who would be willing, to assist&#xD;
im in silencing those lips for ever?&#xD;
These thoughts were by no means nature; but his nervous body&#xD;
anticipated their completion.  His hand jerked towards the bell&#xD;
on the table and might have touched it, if it had not been for its&#xD;
very nervousness.&#xD;
Charles saw the motion; but it had no other effect on him, than&#xD;
the Duke's previous measures---it created another smile.&#xD;
"Ring away, Sir Duke," he said scornfully; "for all the good&#xD;
you ringg wl ido yu. Do you think, that I was silly enough,&#xD;
to beard the lion in his den, without securing my retreat? Allow&#xD;
me, to inform you, that our minister is in the secret and that this&#xD;
secret will start on its wa) to the royal palace, if within one hour&#xD;
from now, I do not make my appearance at the Embassy. Sir&#xD;
uke, will you allow me to repeat my question: Are you ready&#xD;
or an amicable settlement?"&#xD;
The proud noble was completely humbled; he was more than&#xD;
humbled-he was crushed. Raising his hand with a supplicating&#xD;
gesture, he said in a broken voice:&#xD;
"Mercy, mercy! do not proceed. I am willing to do anything&#xD;
you wish; but not now, not now--I am not able to attendtobusi-&#xD;
ness just now--grant me a respite till to-morrow."&#xD;
"I will, Signor, and with pleasure; but mark; if this is merely&#xD;
a subterfuge; if to-morrow you begin your game over again-in&#xD;
that case, I shall refuse to treat. In that case I shall let justice&#xD;
have her sway and publicity her victim."&#xD;

the chamber.&#xD;
On the next morning the papers contained the startling an-&#xD;
nouncement, that the Duke di Gatana had suddenly died in con-&#xD;
sequence of a stroke of apoplexy.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIV.&#xD;
THE RE GALANT HUOMO.&#xD;
Mrs. Fox and her daughter had arrived. The room of the&#xD;
hotel, where Mr. Fox had taken his abode, witnessed a happy&#xD;
scene. They were reunited, reunited after much suffering and&#xD;
some peril. Such adversities are necessary to give us the full ap-&#xD;
preciation of the value of love and friendship. They are apt to&#xD;
make us more contented and better. They made the members of&#xD;
this family better, softening the rough outlines of some charac-&#xD;
ters and giving strength to the new formations of others. Happy&#xD;
they were of course; so happy, that Dolores declared it to be&#xD;
tempting fortune, to force any more gifts from her unwilling&#xD;
hand. She demanded an immediate departure for her home&#xD;
across the ocean and the startling news of her uncle's sudden&#xD;
death could not change her opinion. Yet Charles and Mr. Fox&#xD;
would not listen to her persuasions. The former declared em-&#xD;
phatically, that his own wishes coincided with those of Dolores&#xD;
and that she would be as welcome to him without as with a&#xD;
crown-, but he sided with Mr. Fox, when that gentleman declared&#xD;
that they had no right, to humor the wishes of an inexperienced&#xD;
child, who did not know the value of.the pearls she wished to&#xD;
fling away. Riper years might bring repentance of the rash act&#xD;
and it was Mr. Fox' duty to secure himself against reproaches,&#xD;
which were not probable, but yet possible. So the wishes of Dol-&#xD;
ores were overruled and it was resolved that an audience with the&#xD;
king should be sought and a decision of the case sollicited from&#xD;
his impartiallity and judgment.' The minister easily obtained&#xD;
permission for his protege. to appear and it was decided that Dol-&#xD;
ores in company of Mr. Fox and Charles should be presented.&#xD;
They procured the necessary suits and one afternoon in company&#xD;
with the minister drove to the palace. The king was alone and&#xD;
he received the party with hisusual friendliness and condescen-&#xD;
sion. He had just read the description of the young lady's case&#xD;

beauty, of the youthfulduchess.said&#xD;

reaching his hand to her. "You have gone through many vicis-&#xD;
situdes of fortune, from what I learn-let us hope, that in future&#xD;
only the sun of happiness will shine on your path."&#xD;
"I thank your Majesty."&#xD;
"And this is the worthy gentleman, who has guided your help-&#xD;
less youth in the land beyond the ocean?"&#xD;
"He was and- is my father."&#xD;
"That is right; gratitude is a virtue which adorns every rank&#xD;
and station. I welcome you at my court, Signor Fox."&#xD;
Mr. Fox replied by bowing in silence.&#xD;
"But this second friend of yours-in what capacity must I re-&#xD;
gard him?"&#xD;
"As a cousin, Majesty and a dear friend."&#xD;
Dolores blushed in speaking and the king smiled.&#xD;
"Give me your hand, young gentleman-the friendship of this&#xD;
charming lady is the best recommendation you could bring me.&#xD;
But now having welcomed you, mylady, I would ask you: what&#xD;
do you want me to do in this novel case of yours?"&#xD;
Dolores bowed.&#xD;
"I leave it to your Majesty's best discretion."&#xD;
"And you have no wishes you would want me to regard."&#xD;
"Yes, your Majesty, I have. I have the wish to be spared this&#xD;
wealth and splendor, which, as I have experienced even now, car-&#xD;
ries with it much constraint and hollowness. I want nothing&#xD;
better, than to be allowed, to continue in the circumstances,w here&#xD;
a merciful Providen e has placed me."&#xD;
The king became nore and more interested in this lovely appar-&#xD;
ition&#xD;
"You speak wisely for one so young," he said; but what pre-&#xD;
vents you from indulging in your wishes ?"&#xD;
"The deference in which I hold the opinion of these friends.&#xD;
They both appear to think, that I ought not to decide so impor-&#xD;
tant a matter in my youth and inexperience."&#xD;
'By the Holy Virgin, they are right Dolores. I thank them,&#xD;
for giving me a chance, to see one of the fairest jewels of my&#xD;
crown. No, no, we cannot afford, to lose you child."&#xD;
He stopped and seemed to meditate a little while.&#xD;
"They tell me, the deceased Duke left a son," he began after a&#xD;
while. "What would you say if we solved this Gordian knot, a&#xD;
second Alexander, by making you and him a pair.".&#xD;
Dolores stepped back a step and her consternation at the king's&#xD;
suggestion was so evident, that he could not help noticing it.&#xD;
"My proposal does not seem to meet your approbation," he said,&#xD;
smiling. "I cannot construe your evident repugnance in any other&#xD;
way, than by interpreting it as a declaration, that your heart is&#xD;
already engaged."&#xD;

A deep blush on her cheeks confirmed his suspicion.&#xD;
"And this happy individual," he continued; "does my eye be-&#xD;
hold him?"&#xD;
He glanced at Charles, and Dolores taking courage, seized the&#xD;
young man's hand and presenting him to the king, said :&#xD;
"Your Majesty will make me very happy by approving of my&#xD;
choice."&#xD;
"With pleasure child, with pleasure. I am no tyrant, who rends&#xD;
happy hearts asunder. I congratulate this lucky youth and-to&#xD;
tell the truth-I envy him."&#xD;
The king smiled and seemed to study a second time for a pro-&#xD;
per solution of this question.&#xD;
"I see," he resumed as before. "I can do nothing less, than&#xD;
bestow your rank upon your husband. In such case, Signor,&#xD;
could I count upon your royal support?"&#xD;
The king in speaking-the latter words, had turned to Charles.&#xD;
Our young friend was sorry for this question. It pained him to&#xD;
reject the king's kindness and yet his principles would suffer no-&#xD;
thing else.&#xD;
"Your Majesty will pardon me," he said with a noble grace,&#xD;
that won the' king's approval; "if I respectfully decline the great&#xD;
honor offered me. I am an American citizen, sire and as such&#xD;
forbidden to receive any rank or favor from a foreign potentate."&#xD;
"But you might expatriate yourself" '&#xD;
"I love my country, sire," the young man said raising his head&#xD;
and looking proudly in the king's eye;. "and no consideration,&#xD;
not even my devotion to this hdy could induce me to desert it."&#xD;
The king bit his lips and for a moment it seemed as if he meant&#xD;
to give way to the little resentment, which this open rejection had&#xD;
created. But Victor Ewanuel had not the reputation of a good&#xD;
man for nothing. He promptly conquered the transient emotion&#xD;
and offering his hand to Charles a second time, he said:&#xD;
"Proud as a Republican ! is the ada'e; but I bear you no malice&#xD;
and here is my hand as a pledge of the sincerity of my words. I&#xD;
respect your character, tho' it makes me doubly sorry, that I have&#xD;
go chance of winning you for. my court."&#xD;
Again the king stopped and this time the silence became pain-&#xD;
ful. To end it Charles stepped forward.&#xD;
"Will it offend your Majesty if I give my   opinion un-&#xD;
demanded?"&#xD;
"Not at all, Sir. I should like to hear your views."&#xD;
"I thank your Majesty. It strikes me, that it would hardly be&#xD;
fair to make the Duke's son suffer for his father's faults: how&#xD;
would it answer, to divide the domains of the ducal house between&#xD;
the heirs disputant?"&#xD;
"That is a fair proposal, Sir; but does it meet the lady's appro-&#xD;
bation?"&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.&#xD;
&#xD;
425&#xD;
&#xD;
"Any thing, which Charles proposes, is acceptable to me."&#xD;
"Fair words from fair lips. It strikes me, as if I myself could&#xD;
refuse a ducal crown for the love of such a dams&amp;amp;l. Be it then,&#xD;
as you say ; but I have to make one condition."&#xD;
"Will-your Majesty please to name it?"&#xD;
"I am too selfish, to lose such a fair subject altogether, and&#xD;
therefore make the stipulation, that you spend one third of all&#xD;
your time in my' dominions."&#xD;
"And if I fail?"&#xD;
"You pay the income of the estates for that year to the poor&#xD;
of my kingdom."&#xD;
"Accepted, Majesty."&#xD;
"And now, have you any other favor to ask?"&#xD;
"Yes, with your Majesty's permission I would ask a full pardon&#xD;
of Luigi, the brigand and his band.'&#xD;
The king was evidently both surprised and amused at this&#xD;
request.  /&#xD;
"May I ask you the reason of that request ?" he asked&#xD;
Dolores hesitated.&#xD;
"My answer might impair the reputation of the Duke my&#xD;
uncle."&#xD;
"Never mind! your words are safe with me."&#xD;
So driven Dolores saw herself compelled to narrate, how Luigi&#xD;
assisted her in escaping from the Duke's castle. The king was&#xD;
interested and he was moved. Laying his hand upon the lady's&#xD;
head, he said:&#xD;
"You are as good. as you are beautiful. Will you pledge me a&#xD;
visit every time you visit Italy?"&#xD;
"With all my heart, sire."&#xD;
"Then you shall have the pardon. Excuse me a few moments&#xD;
if you please."&#xD;
With these words the king left the room and Mr. Fox took a&#xD;
long breath. The presence of a majesty evidently did not agree&#xD;
with his 'republican lungs.&#xD;
"Dol," he said; -'I dont know, how you get all the words, to&#xD;
speak so handsomely. I felt all the time as if Iwas standing on&#xD;
ice."&#xD;
Dolores laughed.&#xD;
"And you Charlie, bold rascal that you are, to throw a crown&#xD;
at a king's feet."&#xD;
"Wasn't I right, Mr. Fox?"&#xD;
"Well yes, I think you were. That is-I meant to say-it was&#xD;
rather a ticklish job."&#xD;
Before Charles could reply, the king re-entered the room. He&#xD;
handed Dolores a letter and said:&#xD;
"Here is the pardon. The rascal may thank his lucky star,&#xD;
for your timely interference; for these robbers have got so bold&#xD;

since the war, that I was just meditating a crusade in force against&#xD;
them. But now having granted you a favor, I claim the privilege&#xD;
of asking one myself."&#xD;
"What can I grant, worthy of a king's acceptance?"&#xD;
"That you will allow me, to give away this hand; next to re-&#xD;
ceiving it, it is the greatest pleasure I can conceive."&#xD;
"Your Majesty overwhelms me with his kindness. Indeed we&#xD;
had not thought of so early a marriage  .&#xD;
"But you change your plan to accomodate me-I know you will.&#xD;
You Sir I suppose have no objection to my proposition?"&#xD;
"Not the slightest!" Charles cried with a radiant eye.&#xD;
"I thought so," the king said cooly. "And you Sir?"&#xD;
"I can only say, that the day of their union will be the hap-&#xD;
piest of my life," Mr. Fox responded.&#xD;
"That is settled then. Let it be understood that I give the&#xD;
bride away and make the necessary arrangements. I shall see&#xD;
you again on this. For to-day, you must kindly excuse me-my&#xD;
leisure time is up."&#xD;
The king waved his hand-they were dismissed. Dolores was&#xD;
in a trance and she stated in afteryears, that she never knew,&#xD;
how she reached her hotel.&#xD;
Mrs. Fox and Lucy opened their eyes to their widest extent&#xD;
and would hardly credit the story of the king's gracious condes-&#xD;
cension. Dolores bore her luck meekly Charles his proudly.&#xD;
"And the wedding is to be soon?" Mrs. Fox exclaimed, clasp-&#xD;
ing her hands in token of her surprise and joyous excitement.&#xD;
"Yes mother"-Charles thought he might take that liberty now&#xD;
-"but we don't know the day. The king is to appoint it himself.&#xD;
I don't care, how soon it comes, so that I can get a witness from-&#xD;
the lake. Dol you were a noble girl to think of Luigi; you are&#xD;
so much better and smarter, than I-I should never have thought&#xD;
of sucha thing. Will you give me the paper and allow me, to&#xD;
depart at once, to take the joyful news to Luigi?"&#xD;
"I will Charlie and I charge you to bringshim along without&#xD;
failing."&#xD;
"I'll try my best, Dol. Good by my darling, soon my bride.&#xD;
Mother take good care of her. Good by to all of you."&#xD;
"What Charlie, leave us now? ?" @Ir. Fox exclaimed, You&#xD;
cannot think of such a thing."                        .i&#xD;
"Indeed I can and do. I have to pay a debt of gratitude in&#xD;
which both Dolores and I are concerned. To-morrow might be&#xD;
too late-indeed I have a foreboding, as if it would. Good bye&#xD;
once more and a happy reunion."&#xD;
He drew Dolores into his arms and kissed her tenderly. After&#xD;
that he took his hat and before they could say or do anything to&#xD;
the contrary, he had left the room.&#xD;

It is our duty once more to accompany him on his trip. For-&#xD;
tunately this is the day of railroads and we can let the young&#xD;
man travel with fastest express-train of the road. Behold!he has&#xD;
already reached the station, where he quits the ironway and&#xD;
takes a carriage for the little town of Canti. Now he is there he&#xD;
seeks the magistrate and puts the king's pardon into his hand.&#xD;
The man knows the royal signature and feels a good deal of re-&#xD;
spect for a man, that has influence enough, to procure such a&#xD;
document.&#xD;
"Your Excellency is just in time, to do the work of mercy. To-&#xD;
morrow might have been to late, for I now hold an order from&#xD;
the Secretar of the interior, to use the most rigid measures, to&#xD;
stop the dep edations of these banditti. A company of regulars&#xD;
has been pla ed at my disposal and a most deadly conflict stood&#xD;
in prospect. But how your Excellency convey this joyful intel-&#xD;
ligence to Luigi?"&#xD;
"There is no trouble in that, my friend. I happen to know his&#xD;
place of refuge."&#xD;
"Indeed! If you will pardon the liberty, I should ask, whether&#xD;
your Excellency is the gentleman, who was mixed up with Luigi's&#xD;
last offense?"&#xD;
"I might answer yes to that question and not be far out of the&#xD;
way, Charles replied with a laugh. "But I have little timq to&#xD;
lose-you would oblige me by making out a safe pass for my&#xD;
protege without delay."&#xD;
The magistrate complied with this request and an hour after-&#xD;
wards, Charles again started on his mission pf mercy. He found&#xD;
that road without any trouble; and having gained the pass, as&#xD;
cended it, until he reached a place a few hundred yards from&#xD;
where he knew the sentinel to be posted. A shall whistle brought&#xD;
out the head of the man. Charles broke a green bough and with&#xD;
it advanced until the sentinel told him to stop.&#xD;
"Man, have you forgotten me?" Charles cried to him.&#xD;
"By the madonna, you are signor Carlo, the captain's friend."&#xD;
"Is he at home?"&#xD;
"Yes sir, in truth, he has been a different man ever since your&#xD;
departure and doesn't stir abroad a particle."&#xD;
"I want to see him."&#xD;
"Well come on; a good friend like you one can pass without&#xD;
much danger. 'Ahe captain will be so glad to see you!"&#xD;
And indeed he was glad ! When Charles emerged from the pass.&#xD;
and showed his face to the chieftain, that rpan sprang up, as if a&#xD;
bullet had hit him. One bounce and he lay in Charles arms.&#xD;
"You return ? you have not forgotten poor Luigi?"&#xD;
"No indeed! you hardly thought I would? I am the harbinger&#xD;
of good news, Luigi! I have secured your pardon from the king!"'&#xD;
&#xD;
.,&#xD;
&#xD;

428                    DOLORES.&#xD;
But Luigi did not appear to be glad at these news at all.&#xD;
"I thank you, my friend, for your kind intentions, and I shall&#xD;
take it just the same, as if I could benefit by it. But you know I&#xD;
can not. I -am no better than these, and as they fare, I must&#xD;
fare.''&#xD;
"But, man, I knew all that and therefore procured a free pardon&#xD;
for all.' Or rather she did, Luigi, just think of it, with her own&#xD;
sweetlips she begged the pardon of you all from the king. Here&#xD;
take this. It is the safe pass from the magistrate in Canti for you&#xD;
and all your followers."&#xD;
Luigi took the paper with a trembling hand. Ie wanted to&#xD;
speak; but he-could not. Another moment and that strong man,&#xD;
that man of iron body and iron will, wept like a child. . .&#xD;
"Tell them," he sobbed.-"I can-not-do it."&#xD;
Charles acted on the hint. Mounting on a ledge projecting from&#xD;
the rocks, he waved his hat and by his cries, brought all the band&#xD;
to his feet. They wondered no doubt, what was the matter, look-&#xD;
ing now at their weeping leader, now at the stranger.&#xD;
"Men" he cried. "I have  appy news for you. You recollect&#xD;
the lady, who owes the recovery of her freedom to your generos-&#xD;
ity?-very well; she went to the Capital from here and like a good&#xD;
noble lady, that she is, went to the king, to procure a free pardon&#xD;
for you all. Here I hold it in my hand!"&#xD;
For a moment the crowd were still-they seemed to fail to com=&#xD;
prehend the meaninfQ the words; but after a few minutes, when&#xD;
the consciousness  the' good luck had burst upon their braits,&#xD;
they all broke out nto a loud and simultaneous shout of delight,&#xD;
Some danced, others fell into each other's arms, and a few-like&#xD;
their chieftain-went aside and cried. Charles allowed their first&#xD;
delirium of joy to pass away, before he made another effort to&#xD;
speak; but when he thought them cool enough, to give him their&#xD;
attention, he raised his hand as an indication, that he had more&#xD;
to say.-&#xD;
"I am glad, to see you all so happy,' he resumed. "You have&#xD;
occasion for rejoicin  for a heavy weight has been taken from&#xD;
your shoulders. You a -e newly born, as it were and I hope that,&#xD;
all of you wvill begin a new life. You have my sincere wishes,and&#xD;
what is more, you shall have my assistance. In the name of the&#xD;
good lady, to whom you are indebted for this happy moment, I&#xD;
offer everyone of you the chance of a life, industrious but free&#xD;
of care.'The lady is going to enter upon the possession of large&#xD;
estates, and it shall be my pleasure and my privilege, to employ&#xD;
every one of you according to his talents and his inclinations.&#xD;
Until that time I shall furnish your former leader with the means&#xD;
to support you. None of. you shall leave here and say: I had no&#xD;
chance to amend-destitution forced me back to a freebooter's life.&#xD;
Recollect, we hold out a helping hand to all of you. But we&#xD;

make one condition-one rigid, stern, unchangeable condition. It&#xD;
is: Sin no more!"&#xD;
After these words Charles sprang from the ledge, and so eager&#xD;
were the grateful children of the forest, to press his hand and&#xD;
stammer their thanks, that he found difficulty to catch sufficient&#xD;
air for breathing and space for standing. At last he succeeded in&#xD;
reaching the place where Luigi stood a mute but appreciating&#xD;
spectator of the scene. Charles told to bid the men gather their&#xD;
valuables and then form in procession below the narrow pas-&#xD;
sage. They did not possess much, for with the characteristic&#xD;
thoughtlessness of their class they had always spent their ill-got-&#xD;
ten gain as quickly as they had earned it. Therefore the proces-&#xD;
sion was soon formed and with Charles and Luigi at their head,&#xD;
they marched to Canti to receive a written certificate of their par-&#xD;
don. They formed a singular procession, these wild looking men&#xD;
interspersed with numerous women and children, and many a&#xD;
curious eye stopped on the road to view them and him, that led&#xD;
them. The town was all astir and the sidewalks of the streets&#xD;
lined with spectators. Charles however did not care; freely'and&#xD;
frankly he gazed around and many a pretty maiden acknowledged&#xD;
to herself or her bosom friend, that the foreign signor was a very&#xD;
handsome youth. Charles was proud of his role ; in fact never in&#xD;
all his life had he felt so proud, as at the head of that promiscu-&#xD;
ous band.&#xD;
At the court-house they halted and it required several hours,&#xD;
until every one had his pardon in his pocket. Then Charles made&#xD;
them fall in rank again and led them from the town, until they&#xD;
reached a common with large chestnut trees scattered here and&#xD;
there. Forming them in a circle, and stepping himself into the&#xD;
centre, he made them another, a final speech.&#xD;
"My friends" he said. "I have to leave you now and what is&#xD;
worse, I have to rob you of Luigi for a little while. But he is to&#xD;
come back and in the mean time, I shall see, that you are not&#xD;
lacking the necessaries of life. -How many are there of you?"&#xD;
A census was taken which showed the whole band to number&#xD;
thirty five heads, about one third of which belonged to women&#xD;
and children.&#xD;
"Luigi, how much money is necessary to feed them well for 24&#xD;
hours?" Charles inquired.&#xD;
"A louis d'or will do it well."&#xD;
"Very well I shall take my measures accordingly. My friends,&#xD;
could you camp under these trees for a couple of weeks?"&#xD;
"We can, if the magistrates will let us," a voice from the crowd&#xD;
responded.&#xD;
"I expect to gain their consent. Now mind well, what I tell&#xD;
you. I shall contract with some one in town to furnish you the&#xD;
necessary supplies for thirty days. So long you will be without&#xD;
&#xD;

a leader, for you must learn to lead yourselves, must learn self&#xD;
control and gain self-relianee. These thirty days shall be a time&#xD;
of trial of probation. You must not stray from here and abstain&#xD;
from all and every lawless action.' Those of you, who stand this&#xD;
test, I shall take care of on my return; those however, who are.&#xD;
uuable to restrain themselves so little, as to disregard my wishes,&#xD;
I shall deem unworthy of further sympathy and show them the&#xD;
cold shoulder. And now farewell, I shall go to town with Luigi,&#xD;
and take the necessary measures- in your behalf. Farewell and&#xD;
let me hope that I shall find you here, all of you, on my return."&#xD;
Another scene-of .pressing around the young men; more shak-&#xD;
ing of hands, more shedding of tears-they have left and the&#xD;
members of the little tribe look at one another with eyes as help-&#xD;
less as those of children, who have suddenly been deprived of&#xD;
their mother.&#xD;
Charles and Luigi went to town. Their first walk was to the&#xD;
magistrate, to whom the former explained his intentions con-&#xD;
cerning the late banditti begging his consent to their remaining&#xD;
on the commons, until Charles could take better care of them.&#xD;
The magistrate was a good and kind man and without difficulty&#xD;
granted the desired permission.    .&#xD;
"You are a wise young man" he said to Charles, shaking his&#xD;
hand with sincere admiration. "To have secured the pardon of&#xD;
these men maybe a good deed-but to secure them the chance of&#xD;
an industrious honest life is one, infinitely better. To set these&#xD;
men free and adrift would be little better, than to force them back&#xD;
to their old wicked ways. I admire your generosity and I admire&#xD;
your plan of gradual emancipation. Those of them, who cannot&#xD;
await your return without further transgressions, are indeed unfit&#xD;
subjects of compassion and deserve nothing better, than the&#xD;
hempen noose, which will be their final destiny. I wish you the&#xD;
best success, Signor, in your philanthropic efforts and you may&#xD;
rest assured that you have at least the aid, which I can give and,&#xD;
my prayers."&#xD;
"Thank you, Sir. Tell me would it be much trouble for you to&#xD;
take care of these thirty pieces of gold? I want the money to&#xD;
be spent for the support of my clients and expect to contract&#xD;
with some dne for the provisions. But I fear deception in case&#xD;
the contractor is beyond control and a surveillance on your part,&#xD;
Signor, would no doubt have the happiest effect."&#xD;
The magistrate received the money and promised to see, that i&#xD;
should be spent honestly and properly. Leaving him, Charles&#xD;
went to see a n erchant, whom Luigi had recommended as an hon--&#xD;
est man, and as a fit person, to take the contract for furnishing,&#xD;
the provisions. Our friend was so fortunate as to enlist the&#xD;
man's sympathy and to induce him, to take the contract. So&#xD;
everything was settled to his satisfaction and making a circuit&#xD;
for the purpose of avoiding another contract with the freedmen,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLORES.                       431&#xD;
Charles reached the railroad with his friend and companion, much&#xD;
sooner than he had expected to be able. On arriving at-the hotel&#xD;
in Turin he was of course received with open arms and the reader&#xD;
will readily believe me when I tell him, that the famous brigand&#xD;
too received his due portion of care and interest.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLV.&#xD;
CONCLUsION.&#xD;
The nuptials of our hero and heroine turned out a grand affair&#xD;
The undertakings of a king are not always royal; but in this in-&#xD;
stance they were.. The king according ro the programme gave&#xD;
away the bride and a magnificent bride she was.' I could spend&#xD;
a couple of pages in describing her splendid robe, her veil of gos-&#xD;
samer--thinness-a present of his Majesty,--her priceless pearls;&#xD;
but then I shun the rigid criticism of the fair sex and rather&#xD;
omit the chance of a grand description, than betray my ignorance&#xD;
of the thousand and one articles, which make upa lady's toilet&#xD;
I also pass over the stately appearance of the bridegroom and&#xD;
merely mention, that beside Luigi another visitor of interest was&#xD;
was amongst the guests assembled--I mean the young Duke di&#xD;
Gatana, the cousin of the bride. The generous conduct of Dol-&#xD;
ores had gained her the hearts of her aunt as well as her cousin&#xD;
and although his recent loss would have excused his absence, he&#xD;
could ot refuse himself the satisfaction of .-racing the ceremony&#xD;
by his presence and, as the head of the family giving it his salc-&#xD;
tion,&#xD;
I assure the reader, that it is quite a selfdenial to flow break&#xD;
off the thread of my tale but I see well enough, that it must be&#xD;
done some time or other and where could there de a fitter oppor-&#xD;
tunity than the entrance of my heroes into that harbor of bliss&#xD;
they so richly deserve?&#xD;
In Foxville the establishment has been largely increased and&#xD;
the hands more than doubled. The concern florIshes in spite of&#xD;
the war, or perhaps in consequence of it. Charles who has en-&#xD;
tered as partner gives his workmen a share of his profits and they&#xD;
go for him through the fire, as the Germans have it.&#xD;
In Italy their estates are equally' flourishing. Numerous estab-&#xD;
lishments for raising silkworms or making wine and olive-oil or&#xD;
braiding strawhats or bonnets have sprung up every where on&#xD;
their lands and their "subjects" are all around the subjects of&#xD;
envy. They treat them well and encourage their industryby al-&#xD;
lowing them a fair portion of the profits, which their labor yields&#xD;
They encourageidst}y moreover by putting a premium on in-&#xD;

telligence and establishing everywhere good schools- No child is&#xD;
allowed to work in their factories-but they make it compulsory&#xD;
on the parents, to send their children to school.&#xD;
Amongst their most florishing settlements is that of the freed-&#xD;
men of our acquaintance. They never fail to visit this settle-&#xD;
ment and if ever people were carried on their fellow-being's&#xD;
hands-that expression applied to Charles and Dolores in' the&#xD;
village of the freedmen.&#xD;
Luigi is their indispensable assistant in their Italian domains&#xD;
-Burlesque in those on the other side of the Atlantic. The&#xD;
former is head manager in Europe-the latter in America, and -it&#xD;
is hard to say, which of the two is more warmly attached to the&#xD;
noble pair, which was the maker of their fortune, the founder of&#xD;
their happiness. Luigi is still single; his ardent friendship almost&#xD;
excludes the possibility of his loving. Burlesque on the other&#xD;
hand has recently won the heart and hand of Lucy and now pre-&#xD;
sides as well in a family circle as in that larger establishment,&#xD;
which in harmony and mutual forbearance of its members not&#xD;
only equals but even excells many a family,&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Fox enjoy their usual health but their spirits seem&#xD;
to increase with their years. The name of the former is still in the&#xD;
firm; but it may be said, that he is an honorary member in the&#xD;
true sense of the word. He is regularly absent and exempt from&#xD;
paying fees-is that not the definition of an honorary member?&#xD;
Charlie's parents experience the truth of the bible words which&#xD;
say : "A wise son makes a glad father; but a foolish son is the&#xD;
heaviness of his mother."" They still pretend to live in the cottage&#xD;
but in reality they spend most of their time in the house, which&#xD;
Charles has built in the neighborhood of his own home. They&#xD;
dote upon a little stranger, who has arrived and predict that he&#xD;
will unite his father's integrity and intellect with his mother's.&#xD;
goodness and beauty. Henry is in Italy and so is Richard. They&#xD;
have just served their last term of apprentice-ship under the pleas-&#xD;
ant but firm rule of Luigi. Mrs. Fuchs jr. has lately caused the&#xD;
making out of a deed, by which two handsome farms in Lom-&#xD;
bardy have been settled upon them. If the report is true, they&#xD;
have learned the language and manners of their new country; and&#xD;
look with favorable eyes upon two damsels there, expecting in&#xD;
turn to settle their farms upon them as their bette halves and&#xD;
helpmates.                                                                                  -&#xD;
Mr. Goodman and Sarah his sister and housekeeper, are brav-&#xD;
ing the inroads of old age most cheerfully. As far as cheerful-&#xD;
ness and contentment are concerned, they are likely to cheat old.&#xD;
age out of its dues.&#xD;
