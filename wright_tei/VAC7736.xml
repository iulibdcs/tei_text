S. District Court for the Southern, District of New York.   NAT  GREGORY; Or, The Old Maids' Secret.   CHAPTER I.   IT was certainly a very lonely spot where Prudence Mather dwelt with her sister Abigail, and yet it was in the long sfttled and populous county of Westchester, hardhy more than two hours' drive from the City of New York. ThejFlearest neighbors were a mile distant; and upon the north, south, and west their abode was screen- ed from view by thick woods; indeedj it was only when you were to the east- ward of it, and cast your eyes over a broad and desolate waste of salt mea- dow, that you could see its walls, dark and grim. It was a square, two-story mansion, built of stone; and on the top were two uncouth chimnies, which bore a strong resemblance to a pair of huge ears. For some reason, the win- dows were almost always closed, with the single exception of the one next to the northeast corner. But even this was rarely opened until towards dusk. If you stood off at that hour and viewed the house firom a little distance, you 1 might have imagined it some one-eyed 1 monster, keeping- watch over the soli- 1 tude.               V There were no flowers blooming x   near, yet a few morning-glories and honey-suckles would have taken away much of its stern aspect. The wrens and swallows did not care to have their nests too close, and it was seldom that they were heard chirping and twittering around it, at least not since these two women had made it their home. About forty paces from the door was Hutchison's Creek, at this point rather a narrow stream, yet broad and deep enough for a sloop to ascend at high tide; and which, after flowing on a few miles further and passing under the long bridge that joins Westchester to Pelham township, empties itself into the Sound.  It was somewhere upon the banks of this creek that Ann Hutchison-a strong-minded woman of days gone by -who, in the year I637, was banished from the colony of Massachusets on ac- count of, her religious opinions, came and settled; and, indeed, tradition says that the log cabin in which she spent the remaining portion of her life in con- templation and prayer, and in which she was finally murdered by the Indians, used to stand on the very spot, where,  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7736-00000003"/> at the time our story begins, stood the gloomy abode we have described. At a short distance from the house there was a mill, which, being construct- ed of wood, had not held its own against the rude hand of time so well as its more solid neighbor, and consequently it bore a rather dilapidated appearance. Full forty years had elapsed since its foundations were laid, and everything in it and around it bespoke decay. Oc- casionally some king-fisher might alight for a moment upon the wheel, but it was only for a moment, and then away the bird would dart, uttering its harsh rattle- note as it flew across the salt meadow in search of a more cheerful resting place. Even the rats had left it, only one of the myriads that had once dwelt here having found it in his heart to re- main, and he had a moping, solemn coun- ] tenance; and when, towards sunset, the animal would crawl out through an an- ,( cient hole in the door and take his seat f upon the broken stoop, he looked the c very picture of loneliness.    c That fish-hawk's nest, perched high c up in yonder dead pine-tree beyond the s mill-pond, was likewise deserted, and M for many a  season no brood had been s raised in it, and the winter winds had n well nigh demolished it.     s] Behind the house, towards the close b of a  spring day in the year i839, might b have been seen the ancient maidens pi whose names are given at the com- st mencement of this chapter, both of sc them sedulously employed. Prudence, fa with her sleeves tucked up above her th elbows, thus exposing to view a pair of is freckled, sinewy arms, which tapered we off into strong, bony hands, was work- of ing hard at her churn; and it was evi- dent, from the manner in which she as clutched the handle, that it was her tal fixed determination to make the butter stl   ie come, and at the earliest possible mo- ment; while Abigail--or Abbe, as she se was more familiarly called-was sitting t- near her, rocking slowly backwards and st forwards, arranging a number of musty, re dusty papers; and from the care with 'e which she fingered them, one might have supposed she feared lest her very :s breath would blow them away. g  On being first introduced to these :- two women, it would not strike you that t they were old, and yet more than sixty s summers and   winters had come and egone since they were ushered into - being. The chief reasons, doubtless, r why time had made so slight an im- [ pression on them was the care which r they had always taken of themselves. Frugality had ever been their rule, and - they managed to subsist on what would have starved many other creatures. Their style of dress, too, served to ,conceal the impress of time. Look, for instance, at those brown wigs; how carefully do they hide the tell-tale lock of grey; how neat and clean are those calico gowns, and their trim-built per- sons, unincumbered by hoops, moved with agility and even gracefulness. In stature they were not much above the medium height; but their forms being slender, they had the appearance of being taller than they really were. The boys called them bean-poles, but more polite beholders would call them rather stately dames. Naturally there was some resemblance between them; The face of each was pale and decidedly thin; yet it was not the thinness which is caused by indifferent food and over- work, but the result of a superabundance of nervous energy. Prudence, especially, impressed one as being quick and shrewd, bustling and talkative. But was there anything strange in this when we remember that   she was an "old maid?"  Verily the shrewdest, the most bustling and talka- tive persons on earth are those females who in their wisdom choose the lot of "single blessedness," believing that they can play their cards better in the game of life by "going it alone." Miss Abigail was a year the younger, and though her face was somewhat wrinkled, the expression of it was not displeasing. On the contrary, its slight shade of melancholy rather enlisted your sympathy and predisposed you in her favor; while her eyes, which were large and blue, did not look as if they could dart fite at any body. Her nose, like her sister's, might perhaps have been rather too long for a Venus de Medici, but then it had an inclination upward, and seemed to be doing its best to make you at home in its presence. Not so with Prudence. The wrinkles upon her forehead appeared more like ancient frowns, which had become, as it were, set by .Time-and could not be smoothed away; her eyes were small and greyish, and sunk deep in her head, and there was something strange and cat- like about them. Her nose, instead of being turned upwards, had a downward I crook, resembling a beak, and was so thin at the tip that it seemed sharp enough to cut its way through almost t any obstacle. As for her tongue, need I we say that it was her chief weapon, c both for offence and defence? And- - even when everything went smoothly h with her, and she had no cause whatev- l er for complant, like the fly-wheel on a piece of machinery it kept going and ti going, chattering away at imaginary s foes, approaching nearer to perpetual tl motion than anything else ever did. 1 Of all the gossips in the township of tl Eastchester she was the greatest; and fi there never yet had been any piece of t   e scandal too well concealed to escape the L- "detective" vigilance of this female s "Paul Pry;" and when once it was un- f earthed, she would raise it up before the t grand jury of public opinoin exthtingly, e and with a grip as firm as that with which at this moment she is holding the , handle of the churn. t  "Abbe,' she said, stopping her work t to brush the drops of perspiration from t her face, "what are you about, disturb- ing those papers in that way? I declare - it's a shame. I keep them all so nicely tied together and locked up in the spare bed-room, and now for you to be undo- ing them-why, it's real provoking." "Oh Prudence," replied her sister, with a shudder, " if you'd found them as I did a few moments ago, strewn about the floor in every diredtion, I guess you'd thank me for this, instead of scolding." "Humph! I understand. Well, then, this makes the third time it's happened. Mysterious, isn't it? But, Abbe, don't get nervous; why, it's real fun to me; ha! ha!" "Dear,  oh dear!" muttered  the younger one, shuddering again as she tied up the bundle, "I find it hard to bear; but don't let's talk about it, or I'll lay awake half the night." "What! do you really mean to say that you are frightened?" And as Prudence put this question, there came over her countenance an expression horrible and wild, and Ale might readily have been taken for a witch, had these been the days of Cotton Mather. "Well, you may turn pale," she con- tinued scornfully, "but for my part I say if there are spirits let them untie these papers as often as they please ; let them  rap on the walls and sigh through the key-hole, not a snap of my finger do- I care for them, evil spirits though they be."  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7736-00000004"/> C"Sister, sister, for the Lord's sake, hush, and go on churning!" exclaimed Abigail, covering her face with her hands. "Oh! if poor brother Harvey hadn't--" "Aye, Abbe, if he hadn't drowned himself in the mill-pond! I agree with you there." "Of course, I wish that most of all, Prudence, but I was going to say, if he had never bought this property it would have been better for him, indeed it would, for I really believe it was that that drove him to put an end to him- self." "You fool!" cried the elder one, with the same wild expression, "what on earth had buying this place to do with it?" "A great deal. He never passed a comfortable night after Gerard Fowler got into the County Poor-house; and you know as well as I do what brought him there; and that, together with something else, which is a secret with you, me and Solomon Onderdonk, worked so on brother's mind, that at last it set him crazy." "Bah! you're dreaming. The fact is, you've been going too often of late to visit old Fowler's daughter, who has taken up her quarters with Nat Gregory and that lad Dick, in the cabin between here and the village. The huzzy's been talking to you about her father and saying of course that Harvey wronged him; and no doubt you've told her of the strange things that oc- cur here, and I dare say she's right glad to believe the house is haunted. Ha!" pausing a moment to catch her breath, "it is enough to make the huzzy hate us. To think her father once owned this whole place, the sixty acres, the house, mill and all. But then we came by it fair enough, considering how'   , things go in this world. If he didn't I pay the interest on the mortgage, what r had brother to do but foreclose? And , then if he got it dog cheap by biddincg -it in at the Sheriff's sale, where's the I sin?" "But, sister, you forget-" "No, ha! ha! I don't; it's true a certain gentleman was spirited away, who would have prevented Harvey from buying it; but I repeat, consider- ing how things go in this world, where's the sin? One must swallow his scru- ples or else be made a fool of and die' in a ditch. Yes, you can go and tell Ellen Fowler if you like that if it's her lather's ghost making all these noises, trying to frighten us away, it'll have a hard time scaring Prudence Mather, however much the rappings may affect you."1 "But might it not be brother's spirit?" - "No, no, Abbe; he had too much care for the furniture in his lifetime, to come and make it dance jigs after he is j dead. No, he would'nt dare do that, not while I'm around, any how."   ; It must not be supposed, from the harsh tone in which the elder sister had several times spoken to the younger one, that there was any bad feeling ex- isting between them. Unlike as they were in temperament, they still were strongly attached to each other. While Prudence had from childhood exerted an authority over Abbe which many another might have resented, it had not in the least alienated this meek, kind-hearted being. On the contrary, through many a year of unhalpiness and solitude she had remained true to Prudence, giving her occasionally a lit- tle advice, and often producing a great- er effect than seemed appi:rent from the stern countenance of the latter. .   As will be seen in the course of this narrative, they were both of them (though one in a far greater degree than the other) guilty of a crime which it was the fervent wish of Abigail to atone for, and already she had more than once hinted at a certain course which she hoped her sister might con- sent to adopt. But every time she had opened her lips on the subject, she had been told to keep silent, and the poor woman had hung down her head and obeyed. Being, however, of a very persevering nature, she had resolved not to cease giving the needful advice until successful. Whether or- not the elder sister turned a deaf ear to the end we shall find out when the last chapters of this tale are reached. The strange manifestations which since their brother's death had take'n place in this abode, had not served to lessen Abbe's nervousness and 'anx- iety, and if she believed they were caus- ed by unearthly beings, let us not laugh   at her. We know that the supernatural is considered in this enlightened age an exploded humbug; but remember that everything here was exactly suited for keeping her mind in a morbid state. She never saw company except when Solo- mon Onderdonk came to pay her sister a visit; the monotonous ebb and flow of the tide, the long stretch of dreary salt meadow, the abandoned fish-hawk's nest-but, above all, the memory of her brother Harvey, contributed to depress her spirits, and nothing but the desire to befriend Prudence had kept her from fleeing long ago to some other place. And now while the old maids are still behind the house, one of them pounding at the churn as if she want d to knock the bottom out, and the other leaning back in the chair with her eyes fastened upon the bundle of papers, which are at last all tied together again and lying on her lap, let us go back and endeavor to throw some light on their previous his. tory.  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7736-00000005"/> CHAPTER IL.   THE spinsters had formerly resided in Eastchester, a village on the old Boston post road in Westchester Coun- ty, and here it was that they and their brother Harvey were born. The house in which these three in- teresting events took place, was at the death of their parents turned by them into a tavern ; and none of them having even chosen to marry, they agreed, with a harmony not usually witnessed be- tween members of the same family, to adhere together and assist each other in keeping this place of public entertain- ment. For a number of years, extending from I820 to I833, they had, as the say- ing is, been coining money; for what pays a better dividend than a bar, when the liquor sold is skilfully diluted with some fluid which costs the seller very little, and at the same time makes the bloated toper who drinks it do wn smack his lips and ask for more? Yes, the alcahol which Harvey Mather, of the wily heart and smiling face, had poured  out during these thirteen years'had sent many an unfortunate to his grave, sooner c than he would have gone had he been ( satisfied with drinking water from the fountain.            1 ! But, although this part of their busi- 1 ness was extremely profitable, they,: would hardly have accumulated as much c money as they did, if it had not been s for another branch of it, which we shall now briefly describe.       V As we know, those were days when- c railroads had not penetrated the coun- b   d lty of Westchester, and whenever the d gay young men of New York wished to i- enjoy a trot in the pure air and not be r annoyed by the din of the city pave- ments, the course they usually took was - along the Third Avenue towards Har- e lem Bridge, drawing rein a moment at 1 Cato's, merely to water their nags, then , on they would go across the river, fol- i lowing the Boston post road, and, for - the most part, not stop again in ten miles, until a creaking sign board on the wayside told them Harvey Math- - er's was reached. As they came dashing into the village, many a crone would drop her knitting needles, and, with hands uplifted, cry out: "Lor', see, they are running away!" While folloving close behind, doing their best to citch up, would be seen a number of barefooted, white-haired ur- chins, each of them striving to get to the tavern first, in order to hold the horse's head. It would have been difficult to find a person who understood better than Harvey how to welcome these city visit- ors; who, by the way, arrived generally on Sabbath afternoons. For their sole accommodation, a small but snug room in the second story had been set apart, and no other guests were ever allowed to cross its thresh- old, unless, of course, with their con- sent. He-re they might enjoy their cigars without ever breathing a stray whiff of cheap tobacco smoke from the bar-room below, where the air was always toul   and where the red-nosed loafers had not the knack of getting drunk in a gentlemanly way. Adjoining this was a pantry neat as wax and communi- cating-with the kitchen by a narrow stair-case. It was in this latter place that Abi- gail stayed to cook the savory dishes which had given the tavern a high repu- tation; while Prudence was mistress of the pantry, and prided herself on the skill with which she mixed the gin cock-tails and the brandy punches. If you look around you here you will find eyerything in perfect order. In each of the four corners stands a demijohn containing various liquors, all of the best quality, while ranged upon the shelves of yonder cupboard are a num- ber of bottles of wine, cheeses, boxes of sardines, jars of sweetmeats, in fact almost everything which the fastidious tastes of the young gentlemen may call for. Even the mint, of which there lies a large bunch freshy picked, ap- pears greener and smells better than mint generally does. Amongst those whom the tavern- keeper used to consider his best pa- trons, was a tall, dark-complexioned youth named Alexander Norris, with hair as black as a raven's wing, and a light moustache covering his upper liip. Handsome he -certainly was, and yet there was something about him which told you that he had strong passions and kept late hours. He could sing a capital song, in his manner was free and easy, and although rich and rather a dandy in his dress, was not above 1 wishing good-day to the rough-looking  countrymen whom he used to find loung- I ing in front of the tavern door when he t arrived. And of all the horses that  ever came to a halt here, it was his the barefooted boys were most anxious to 1   I take care of, for they knew he would t pay them better than any others. *  In the private parlor, above stairs, he -was full as popular as he was below, if r not more so; for in his own right Nor- ris was possessed of a large fortune, and he was a very convenient friend to have at otle's elbow when in an emergency a twenty or a fifty dollar bill was needed. His money had been left him by his fa- ther, who had toiled in Wall street till his hair had grown grey ; and as the old gentleman was now under the sod, to- gether with his wife, and as Alexander had no brothers or sisters to share the fortune with; and, moreover, no wife to support, is it wonderful that he should have become extravagant and entertain- ed but a vague idea as to where the dividing line existed between his prin- cipal and his income? Had he made his own fortune, he would of course have husbanded it bet- ter ; as 1Harvey remarked one day, with a knowing wink at Prudence : "He got his dollars easy, and them's always the freest to spend." - True," replied the old maid on that occasion, " and what's more, I see he's took an uncommon fancy   for Jerry Fowler, and the miller thinks the world of him. Oh, brother, if you only play your carp rightly you'll make a nice thing out of them both." "Out of them all, sister, and-" low- ering his voice and smiling grimly, i, I'll yet be the richest man in this township; Solomon Onderdonk may perhaps be as rich, but no richer; and only that he's too cute to come here and risk anything gambling, he, too, would be forced afore long to borrow of me, just as some of these young gentlemen are now doing, and to give me his notes as security." "Ha!" exclaimed Prudence, rubbing her hands together and then scratching  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7736-00000006"/> the tip of her nose, " this world, with- out filthy lucre, as parson Jeremiah calls it, what would it be?- Life without it means ragged clothes and no friends; when you're sick, no doctor; and when you die-" "A pine box and no hearse," -concluded Harvey with a hollow laugh. f"Ha, sister, old Fowler may come to that yet; but you and I never shall, eh? I-a, ha 1" The tavern-keeper having now filled a decanter of sherry, brought it into the private parlor, closely followed by the old maid, who smoothed her apron down and made her appearance before the company with a low courtesy. Seated around a green-covered table were half a dozen person's, all too deeply absorbed in a game of cards to notice at first who ,entered. Several of them could scarce- ly have attained the age of twenty. And yet the life they led served to render them premature. The only individual present who seemed not to be of their, ,class was Gerard Fowler, the miller, and he evidently had been at no small pains to improve his personal appear- ance, brushing the flour out of his coat and combing down his hair, in which the streaks of grey were already visible; the  broad-brimmed, antiquated white hat which he wore, was thrust under- neath the, table, and lay hidden between his feet, as if he were ashamed of having 1 it seen.              ] When the tavern-keeper and his sis- X 'ter entered, he did not even raise his c eyes from  the cards; and although he strove hard to prevent it, his hands were s trembling  and there were  nervous 1 twitchings  about the corners of his s mouth. This for him was a moment of intense excitement, seeming to alternate h between hope and fear as to whether he p should win or lose. "Won!" presently exclaimed a hol- a   i- low-eyed youth, opposite, as he threw his h last and 'lucky card down, and then t leaned back and yawned; after which, i; resuming an ereot posture, he drew to. n wards him, with seeming indifference, ' the pile of bank notes that laid in the  centre of the table. ") "Well," said Norris, assuming a care- ?. less air and lighting a fresh cigar, "1'lll do better next time; and so will you, I friend Fowler, eh! Cheer up, sir! and  now, gentlemen, before we separate let's ; fill our glasses and drink the health c: Miss Prudence Mather, whom   I see : standing before us." At once the. company raised the wine ' to their lips ; and as they did so, the old maid endeavored to blush, and put on all the airs and graces of a lass of " sweet sixteen."  But, alas! the skin of her face refused to change its sallow hue for any other color, and she had to content herself with thrusting the tip of her little finger into her mouth-nd casting her eyes upon the carpet. "What an ugly wench this is, to be sure," said Norris, leaning towards the miller and giving him a poke in the side. Mr. Fowler nodded his head and whispered, "Not so loud." The truth is, every one at the table was more or less affeEted by the sherry which they had been sipping during the last two hours, and the young man had not spoken in as low a tone as the rules of propriety would have dicated. "I heard you," muttered  Prudence, still gazing on the floor and grinding her teeth; " and I'll be even with you, sooner or later." As the sun was already below the horizon, the party broke up and pre- pared to return to the city. It was Sunday evening, and no doubt at this very moment there were sisters   and mothers wondering what had be- come of their dear Dick, Tom, and /Harry, and whether they had spent the day in a becoming manner.  What would have been their feelings had they beheld one after another of these scapegraces mounting into their light waggons; some of them, indeed, not being able to do so without Harvey's assistance, singing Bachanalian songs and indulging in the use of profane words? The last to depart was Alexander Norris; and as he placed his foot upon the step of his vehicle, the miller stretched his arm out for him to lean on. It was while standing in this po- sition that he suddenly gave vent to his feelings in a boisterous laugh; then, quickly checking himself, he whispered something in Mr. Fowler's ear. The man started, and looking nervously over his shoulder, "Where?" he ex- claimed." "Why, there, just turning the corner yonder; sad and lonely." "Dear child," sighed the parent, s "how affectionate she is; she cares  more for me than she does for herself. v But I wonder what she can be doing in 1 that direction!"-         1 "Ha! it's the way to the city, sir; e perhaps she's tired of living here, and 1 wants to see more of the world. How r pretty she is! In New York she might ( become a belle. But if she remains in c this place-what is it the poet says, s "Full many a flower is-born to-is I born to blush unseen, and-and waste 1 its sweetness --on --on- Bah, my head's all topsy turvy, and I've forgot- t ten those beautiful lines; but they suit r her case exactly. Now, I must be off; a gcod night, better luck next time, eh? h Lcsing only makes me determined to e plzy on. The tide can't always run A1   against me or against you either, and when it does turn, whew! Good-bye; hurrah for luck!" And with this parting exclamation Norris took his seat, tossed a piece of silver to the boy who stood by the horse's head, then drawing tightly the reins, he was soon out of sight of the gazing villagers. His friend cast a lingering look after him as he sped along, Jehu like, and after he was lost to view, slowly turned and bent his steps homeward. It may appear strange that he did not follow in the direction which his daughter had taken. The truth is, he felt ashamed of meeting her. "What a fool I am!" he exclaimed as he walked along the lane leading down to the creek where stood his house and his mill. "Aye! am I not even worse than a fool to keep on fre- quenting this tavern, week after week, after promising her that I would not do so? There I spend all my Sabbaths and risk and lose all that she lays by- she, my only offspring, the very image of my departed wife I Oh God! how wicked I am! and then, if Ellen knew that the dear old place where she was born is mortgaged, and that I can't even pay the interest, it would break her heart. And to think, too, that it's mortgaged to that foxy Harvey Mather! Curses on him, for tempting me as he did! Yes, confound  his wine, his smiling face, and -his fine company I But it's too late! Oh, my God. it's too late!" As he spoke thus to himself the tears trickled down his cheeks as they had not done before in many a year. Just at this moment he heard a voice behind himn which he well knew to be the tav- ern-keeper's, calling out, " 1r . Fowler, Mr. Fowler."  But, unheeding the ceil,  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7736-00000007"/> he kept on his way, groaning and clenching his fists in an agony of despair. "Hardly thought I'd overtake you, but I did," continued Harvey; "I only wanted to remind you, sir, -of the inter- est which is now more than due, and I want to have the money. It's cost me a pretty sum to fix up my hotel this season, and I'm afraid I'll lose by it unless I look sharp. The rate was put low, only six per cent., on purpose to make it come easy. Can't you settle with me at once?" "What, now? this evening?" "Oh I of course I mean to-morrow." "To-morrow, humph! to-morrow. Well, yes, I'll say to-morrow," replied the debtor, who knew that in his purse there was not one single dollar left,. and whose only hope was that his daughter,' who, though scarcely in her teens, was an excellent manager, might have saved up something; enough, at any rate, to silence his creditor! for a while, and until, as Norris had said, the tide might turn, and he'd be a winner." "You've told me to-morrow before," continued Harvey; "but this time, I trust, it really will be to-morrow; so, Mr. Fowler, I'll bid you good night. And turning on his heel, he went back to the village. While this conversation in mill-lane was progressing, a gentle- man driving along the post road towards New York, was hailed by a young girl, l who, with out-stretched arms, implored a him to listen to her.       b "Give me but a minute, sir, only a n minute," cried Ellen Fowler in an agitat- e ed voice, "and I'll tell my story. I am the daughter of Gerard Fowler, the v miller, and I have heard my father say v you were very kind to him; so I  re- i solved, Mr. Norris, to ask you to do me t a kindness, too."   1  "Why, my pretty bird, I'll do any- f thing you wish! speak, what is it?"Ihe said, holding the reins in one hand , while he rubbed his forehead with the r other,as if to clear away the fog which - the wine had gathered in his brain. "Thanks, sir; a thousand thanks! do beg him, then, to stop going to Harvey ; ather's tavern. He'll be ruined unless he does. Poor father has lost ever so much money there already. How, I don't exactly know; but I feel sure it's been in that horrid place. And now, when he comes home in the evening, he hardly speaks a wold to me, but sits staring at the wall and looking so very, very unhappy." "Well, my little beauty, don't take it too much to heart,' replied Norris, who was touched by her sobs, "I promise to try and persuade him to give up his bad habits; yes, it would no doubt be better for him and for me too, not to go there. Of one thing, however, you may rest assured, I will always stand by your father, no matter how hard the tide runs against him; and if the homestead has to be sold, that sly tavern-keeper shall not be the purchaser. I'll be present at the sale, and can bid higher than he or any other around here." Then kiss- ing his hand to her, he drove on, leav- ing her not a  litttle puzzled as to his meaning. "  If the place has to be sold," she re- peated to herself, over and over again, as she walked back through the village to the creek; and the words seemed more and more mysterious, and oppress- ed her with-a vague foreboding of evil. Oh, what a brave little heart her's was. Though not yet in her teens, she was struggling with all her might to preserve her father's credit and gccd name. During the last six months Mr. Fo,.;-   ler had become extremely careless about his affairs; everything had been ne- gle6ted. When grain was brought to the mill it almost always fell to the lot of Ellen to count the bags and mark the number down in the book, and even set the mill-wheel going with her own hands; and although she perhaps-did not'do all this quite as skillfully as an adept, still the sunburnt farmnners' lads who brought the grain and returned for the meal ut- tered no words of complaint. On the contrary, some of them found it difficult to tear themselves away from the spot, and seemed anxious to know whether she did not need any assistance.  : Since her father had fallen into evil 1 habits she found it more and more un- ] pleasant to go to the village to make her X purchases. How could she look people a in the face without blushing when so i many bills were; unpaid at the different X stores? For instance, there was the t butcher, who had allowed his account to run on for more than a year, so that v now she really could not bear the idea M of asking for more credit, especially as a he was so gentle in his demeanor to- o wards her. Then there was the store- tl keeper, to whom another large sum was C due; as also the blacksmith, the shoe- tl maker, and the whieel-wright. But thus far nilt one of them had fe threatened to sueJ her father, nor even ci urged him to a settlement of their ac- counts, yet little did she divine why they af were so forbearing; and much as the hi miller valued his child, even he did not ge know how far her rosy cheeks and tr sweet, innocent face went towards keep- let ing'his creditors at bay.     for After what has already been said, the ga way Mr. Fowler's difficulties arose pro- an bably needs little further explanation. co Enticed by Harvey Mather to the tav- ern, where he had made the acquaint- ram   ut ance of the gay lotharios from the city, e- he had very soon taken to gambling :o with them, with the usual result. Hav- )t ing lost all the money he possessed, he e borrowed, again and again, the needed :t amounts from Harvey, who patted him :; on the shoulder and told him he could "have as much as he wished. At first "promissory notes were all that were de- t manded, but after the debt had become - formidable, the lender resolved to e change his ta5tics. As we have said, his t mill was negleted ; he frequently quaff- , ed the inebriating cup, and so he had rgone on from step to step in the path of folly and ruin, until finally one day the tavern-keeper told him that as he was not in any pressing need of money, the notes, several of which were due, might all be taken back and destroyed, "and in their stead," added the wily man, "I will accept a mortgage on your real es- tate at a very low rate of interest." He spoke so kindly, that Mr. Fowler was quite thrown off his guard; and when Prudence came into the room with a bottle of wine, he partook freelv there- of, and then, with Harvey's aid drew up the coveted instrument and signed it. Oh, could he have read Mather's heart the moment when his fingers grasped the paper, how differently would he have felt I The sherry, which tasted so deli- ciously, would have turned to gall. "Those sixty acres will be all mine afore long," said Harvey, chuckling, as his eyes gloated over the lines and lin- gered upon the signature, written in a trembling hand at the bottom, " aye, I'll let him have as much wine as he wants for nothing, and then he'll keep on gambling. The interest won't be paid, and by and bye, when the right time comes, I'll put the screws." And now, before we bring this rather rambling chapter to a close, let us say t&amp;  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7736-00000008"/> a few words about Alexander Norris. He was not yet married. He had, however, made a deep impression on the heart of a certain young lady, Miss Emmlna P--- , daughter of a naval offi- cer. She was an exceedingly beautiful creature, and her love for him, and the implicit faith which she reposed in his honor, had led her into too intimate relation with him. Unfortunately, she had no mother to watch over and coun- sel her, and Captain P-- being much away on long cruises, she was deprived of those safeguards which are necessary to thlrow around the gentler sex, to pro- tect them from the evils of designing men. hie had, of course, the usual number of aunts and uncles, but these had their own offspring to attend to and nere probably desirous of seeing their niece settled in life. Then, too,  she was placed in still greater jeopardy  by the death of her father, which sad ( event occurred as he was returning t home from the Mediterranean. -  Just one week after the interview s between Ellen Fowler and this young S gentleman on the Post road, and while the miller's daughter was walking home o from evening service at the Episcopal b church, alone and sad as usual, she was a accosted by a female dressed in deep h mourning, with a vail drawn over her to face.               S In a moment, however, it was partly ul lifted, enough to show a beautiful mouth d full of the whitest teeth, and the gloved tI haeld which held it up was as white and small as her own. It requiled only aglance to see that vc she did not belong to the village or its neighllborhood, and Ellen felt curious to pa know who she might be.       t, "Can you tell me," inquired the da stranger, in a voice which had some- mi thing very mournful about it, "where I   is. may find Harvey nlather's tavern?" Id, "How odd!" thought the miller's on daugliter, "what can she possibly want ss with any body in that wicked place?" i- and she stared a moment at the lady, ul with a feeling of mingled curiosity and le awe, before answering,: is  "'Tis yonder, ma'n, where the sign te hangs. I pass right by it myself." 'e  Presently they arrived opposite the l- place, and the sign-board, as it swun7 h to and frow in the evening breeze, d seemed to be complaining of its hard y lot, perched up so high in the air, ex- - posed to every storm; and never be- g fore had the girl heard it creak so 1 dismally. :  But instead of entering the building, , as Ellen had expected she would, the , stranger continued on, side by side with her, shuddering a moment as she recog- nized a' well-known voice conling from one of the upper-story windows,; and the miller's daughter likewise felt un- easy and blushed, for she could hear somebody minentioning the name of her parent. - "Oh, play on, Mr. Fowler, do play on! she can't see you through the blinds," cried Norris, who, alas! was as much infatuated!with gambling as his friend, and who already had forgot- ten all about the promise which only seven days bebfore he had ;madcle this unhappy man's daughter. "Oh, do sit down,"' he continued, pulling him by the coat and forcing himn back. "No, of course you can't leave us yet," exclaimed a number of other voices; "rfinish this game first." Ellen and her companion huri'ied past, and when at length they reached the head of the mill-lane, the miller's daughter gave a deep sigh and mur- mured," poor father 1" The stranger at once stopped, and   throwing her veil entirely off, seized E1- len's hand and pressed it fervently. "Have I then a companion in mis- ery?" she exclaimed. "There is some one ruining himself in that accursed tavern who. is dearer to me than ever my father was. Will you pray foqr him? Oh do, I beseech you! and I will offer up my supplications to Heaven for your parent. God may hear us both; pray, pray!" Her manner was so impassioned that Ellen almost fancied she might not be in her right senses. Nevertheless, she assured her she would that very evening remember in her prayers this unknown person. "Thank you, oh, thank you! fare- well," said the lady, again pressing her hand. Then turning abruptly around, she walked back toward the village. The stars were just out this evening, when Norris started on his way home to New York. His spirits were not as high as usual, for the tide had run heavily  against him ; he had lost materially, and so had the miller.        : He had hardly driven a mile, when,  almost at the very same spot as before, a person stopped him; but this time it, was a being who had far greater cause  than Ellen Fowler for doing so; Emma e P----,. with her face uncovered, had a thrown herself partly in front of his wa-  gon (which happily was not going very  fast) and so close, that before he could stop, the wheel had struck her. I "There you are again!" he exclaimed 7 angrily, " and with the same old story,  of course. Bah! stand aside and let me I goon!"I, "No, no," she replied, seizing the 1 dash-board, "(I shall remain here, you t may crush me if you like--yes, do, un- a less you intend to keep your plighted word. Ohl it is not for myself I am t]   - begging; but for the child which is to be born. Do nrot disgrace it; marry me. - It is all I ask, then turn me adrift; I e vow never to cross your path again." While she was speaking the unfortu- r nate young lady had fallen upon her ? knees, and, when she had finished, 1 she could bear up no longer, and with a 1 stiffled cry, sank down in a swoon.  Her seducer watched her for a mo- ment, muttering some oaths, but pre- t sently he noticed that her left arm lay so close to the horse's hoofs that the : restless animal was kicking it, and at once his heart relented. He remember- ed that he was a man and she a woman, that he had been the tempter, and that she had only yielded after he had told her he would make her his wife. "Well, well, I cannot," he said, jump- ing out and lifting her up in his arms. Presently Emma's consciousness re- turned, ann the first thing she said was, "Think of the child!" and then burst into tears. i"Yes, yes, I'll do it!" he continued, raising her into the wagon, and then mounting himself. He now turned the hnrse's head to-' ward Eastchester again, but he did not stop an instant in the village. On the contrary he hurried through it, as if he dreaded lest some of the tavern loung- ers might recognize him, late as it was. And still keeping on the Boston road he passed New Kochelle, and yet on- ward did his swift steed trot, until at about the hour of ten the old town of Mamaroneck was reached. "We shall be married here to-night," he whispered, assisting his comnpanion to descend, " and then you go one way and I another I What say you?" A low, almost inaudible "yes" was the reply.  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7736-00000009"/> Alexander Norris kept his word. Be-  fore the next morning's sun arose, they    parted as man and wife, never to meet again.   CHAPTER III.   T Erloave already said that the house in which the old maids dwelt was remote from any other, and that the nearest one to it was a umile distant. This was the cabin mentioned by Prudence in her conversation with Abi- gail, as the place where Ellen Fowler had taken up her residence with a cer- tain Nat Gregory and a lad called Dick. It was a quaint, one-story building, standing back about twenty steps from the road that led from the village of Eastchester to the mill on Hutchison's creek, and generally known as mill- lane. The boards out of which it was constructed were whitewashed, and instead of having a chimney to it there was a piece of stovepipe sticking through the roof, while the roof itself sloped backwards until it almost touch- ed the ground in the rear, and gave to the whole a very odd appearance. A patch of sweet corn, three or four inches high, and some early pumpkins were growing behind it, all carefully weeded, while the space in front was covered by a miniature forest of sun- flowers, which seemed to be smiling . and nodding at one another as the morning breeze rustled through them. i From the door of the cabin to the 4 little gate opening on the lane, there ran l a nicely sanded path, and close beside 1 the gate grew a wild apple tree with a-.  robin's nest hidden among its green s leaves. And here, while the mother s bird passed day after day waitin' pa- 1 tiently for the little ones to come forth, b herfaithful mate, from another tree close u by, sung merrily as though to cheer her i   e up, and assuring her that all would come t out right in the end. e  At the moment of which we are speak- itig, the door of this humble abode stood y wide open, for it was the first week in - May, and the young woman, who was r seated outside, did well to let the soft, - delicious air blow in among the cob-  webs, and freshen up the nooks and , corners. I  The pair of woolen socks which she f was knitting had to be held very closely i to her eyes, for Ellen's sight, once al- most as sharp as an eagle's, had within the past few years sadly failed ; and in his usual dry, matter of fact way, the village doctor had informed her that she might before long lose the use of them altogether. There had been a time when any one would have considered her beautiful; and we remember that a cer- tain gentleman had once told her father that in the city of New York she might become a belle. But that was fifteen years ago, when she was only entering her teens; now she is seven and twenty. Although she never had suspected it, the bluff butch- er, long since numbered with the dead, had been desperately in love with those eyes of hers; and that was the reason why he had never been able to say any- thing harsh to her about her parent's neglect in paying his bill. Her cheeks, so rosy then, were now marked with small-pox; and her once luxuriant brown hair looked thin and sickly, while her fingers seemed scarcely able to hold up the knitting needles. And while she is sitting in front of the cabin, with the  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7736-00000010"/> sunbeams streaming down upon her, and the robin singing so merrily, let us go back and speak a little of the hard- ships which she has endured since her childhood.           A Not many months after her interview with Alexander Norris that evening on the old post road, Harvey Mather had "put the screws," as he expressed it, foreclosed the mortgage which the miller had given him, bought in the sixty acres by the creek, and of course turned the unhappy man and his daughter out of doors. They then found themselves in the wide world destitute of everything save the clothes on their backs; and yet Ellen bore the loss of her home bravely; and so far from looking ashamed when people met her, she felt proud to think that all her parent's debts were paid at last. She did not know the sale of the homestead had been a forced one, for Mr. Fowler had told that he had taken this step for the purpose of satisfying all his creditors. The inauguration of a life of strug- gling for the support of herself and pa- rent, seemed only to bring forth new energy ; and she resolved to lose not a day in trying to get employment. For- tunately, she was an excellent seam- stress, and several families at once promised to give her work. Having hired a small house on the outskirts of the village, she commenced her new life ,with thefirm I esolution never to bay any- thing without paying for it at the time of purchase, and to keep the rent as far as possible paid in advance. F Por seven years did she strive to do this; yes, for seven long years. But it proved, alas, up-hill work. The miller gradually re- lapsed into his evil ways, and again be- gan to pass most of his time at the tav- ,ern.   It is true he did not associate, as formerly, with the gay young men from town, for he looked too shabby; and, besides, he had no longer any money to stake at the gambling table. tut he would hang around the bar-room door until some sympathizing toper would ask him in and treat him to a glass of rum. Then he would hasten home and insist upon Ellen giving him what money she had; and, in the linld-. ness of her heart, she always yielded to his solicitations. His purse being thus resupplied, he would repair to the tavern and spend every cent in dissipation; and when night came, and he returned home, what a disgusting sight -he pre- sented! brutally intoxicated, and so alarming her that often she dared not sleep. Sometimes she ventured to re- mind him of the promises which lhe had made; but it was all to no purpose; it seemed as if the harder she struggled the worse he became. All she earned he spent. His only coat and her only dress became too ragged to admit of their being seen out of doors. She found it impossible to pay the rent, small as it was; and when she, mention- ed this to him, he shrugged his shoulders and laughed, and staggered off to get his liquor. Then  she would weep, but nobody saw her or heard her lumenta- tions. At last the landlord notified her that he could no longer afford to furnish them a house rent free, and that Ihey must seek some other resting place. Accordingly, she and her parent found themselves a second time without a house; but to him it appeared to mnke very little difference. In fact, he de- dared that he preferred sleeping in tLe bar-room, and advised her to go off and shift for herself. This of course she would not consent to, and'for a year or   two subsequently they lived a nomadic sort of life in the vicinity of Eastchester, of course becoming very wretched, for people said " what's the use of giving Ellen Fowler any sewing to do, the mon- ey is all spent by her father for rum." At last, her heart almost broken, she accompanied him to the county poor- house at White Plains. But why, it may be asked, had not Alexander Norris come to the rescue the day the home- stead was sold under the decree of fore- closure? He certainly had promised Ellen that Harvey Mather should never possess it; that he would buy it himself, and then give it to her. During the course of this story the reason will be made clear. One thing, however, there is no harm in revealing at once, namely: that the young gentleman had not made his appearance on the morning of'the sale, nor had any one seen him since. It would be impossible to describe what the girl's feelings were, when she stepped across the threshold of the long, nar- row building which was in those days not alone a poor-house, a mad-house, or a hospital, but alittle of all three combined. She clung closer to. her pa- rent's side than ever, and could not bear to raise her eyes to look upon her new associates. Occasionally one of them would be seized with delirium-tremens, and his raving struck terror into her heart. Besides the drunkards, there were several idiots, and one maniac. The latter, however, was confined in a room under ground. Imagine this once happy, laughing girl, sitting by these creatures at table, and sleeping near them at night. After being there about ten days, Mr. Fowler was attacked with small-pox, and was removed to an apartment in a: 'remote part of the building, where he would be isolated from the other in-   "mates. He rapidly grew worse, became ', flighty, talked about the mill and Har- r vey Mather, and the fine company he ? had known at the tavern, to the'no small - wonder of the pauper nurse detailed to watch him; and one entire night was ' spent by him in frantic calls for his - daughter. At last, when it was evident r his end was approaching, the physician allowed his daughter to come and see - him, and by the bedside she remained. - until his spirit had taken its flight. She I herself caught the loathsome malady, and for a number of days her life was despaired of. Thanks, however, to a constitution naturally robust; she recov- ered, but was a different looking being ever after. The bloom on her cheeks was gone, and in .ieu thereof the pit- marks usually atten :ant upon this loath- some disease were observable. As we may suppose, she did not wish to tarry in the poor-house longer than was neces- sary to recover her strength. And dur- ing the first fortnight of her convales- cence, she pondered deeply on her situa- tion, and what she should do for its im- provement. It happened as she was returning one afternoon from a neigh- boring house, whither she had been sent with a message, that her attention was drawn to two persons standing by the wayside, not far from the entrance to the institution. One was a youth of nineteen or twenty, the other a boy of about ten.  Each was armed with a stick, and evidently bent on catching something which had taken refuge in a pool near them.  The, younger of the two was a handsome little fellow, with black eyes, sunburnt face and  curly hair, and seemed brim full of mirth as he dashed here and there in pursuit of a frog, with his pants rolled up above his knees, and every now and then plunging his hand into the water.  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7736-00000011"/> His companion was likewise enjoying the sport greatly, but his emotions ap- peared to vent themselves, not in loud laughter, but in frequent cracking of the knuckles and very broad grins. At times, however, his countenance would assume a thoughtful, earnest expression, which struck Ellen, as she stood watch- ing them. Instead of being sunburnt, his com- plexion was fair and  spotted with freckles; while his locks, which were thick and straight, had a yellowish tinge. His nose was what might be called long, but the downward curve in it was so slight that it could hardly be termed a beak, like  Prudence Mather's. His general appearance was that of a rest- less and shrewd, but at the same time honest and generous being, who, no matter how often bad fortune might assail him, would always come out of the conflict unscathed; and who, al- though fond of making money, would not hold it with a miser's grip after he had obtained it. And such, indeed, was the character of Nathaniel, or rather Nat, Gregory, as we shall more often call him. "I say, m'am," cried the boy, looking up and addressing himself to Ellen, "come lend a hand; he's a smashin' big critter, and good as steak when he's fried.  Do come, and if we catch him you may have one of the hind legs." Unable to resist this appeal, she ad- vanced and began straining her eyes to catch a glimpse of the frog's head, which the little fellow assured her ought to be up by this time. Nat grinned as he saw the interest she was taking. in the matter, then sud- denly became solemn, and stood for nearly a minute partly on one leg, with the fore finger of his right hand placedc against the side of his nose, "Got him   now!" he  exclaimed, cracking his knuckles. "Richard, all this sort of work is useless, run and fetch me yon. der tin pail; quick!"In a moment the boy was at his side with the wished for article, then pulling off his coat and placing a couple of stones in the pool on which to stand, the young man be- gan bailing out the water, and at such a rapid rate that Ellen was surprised, while Dick winked at her and whisper. ed " that critter's a goner; Mr. Gregrory never sweats for nothing." Sure enough, the animal's green head soon became visible, then his back and at last down came Nat's right -hand, like the swoop of a hawk ; and as he thrust the frog into his trowsers' pocket, remarked cooly, as if to himself, "One is better than none for supper." Thus far he had not addressed her a word, and she was on the point of returning to the poor-house, when he cried " stop," and frankly in- vited her to remain and accompany them. a You're welcome to join us, if you've a mind to," he said; " you'll find me true; and as for him," pointing to- wards Dick, " he's hard to beat. He and I have lived on frogs and air for about a week now, and I guess the folks in yonder poor-house don't get much bet- ter victuals. Might as well join our fam- ily, m'am: life's a hard road to travel, any how, and my docrine is that the more there are to pull together on the way, the easier it is getting over the rough parts." For a moment Ellen hesitated; while the boy nodded his head, and pulled her dress as a token of anxiety to secure her compliance; then looking intently at the young man, as if to read his heart, she yielded her assent. And with them she has remained from that day to the present; Gregory main- taining both her and the boy, chiefly by   his skill in stuffing birds, for which he finds a ready sale in New York city. Six years have elapsed since they met at White Plains, and during. all that time they have lived in the greatest harmony. At this moment, while Ellen is busy knitting a pair of socks, the young man is at work behind the house repairing a hand-cart which he uses for transporting his prepared birds, &amp;c., from place to place ; while Dick, who is' just the same merry fellow as when we first saw him, and, moreover, extremely handsome, is so much absorbed in read- ing a book which he holds in his hand, that he seems to be perfectly oblivious to what is transpiring around him. And now, while Nat Gregory hammers away at the cart, let us say a few words in re- ference to his antecedents. Nat was born somewhere along the banks of the Connecticut river, and from an early age he had shown great' restlessness, and a desire to rove ; but- the direction in which his eyes were al- most always turned was the great West. Chopping wood and driving ox teams had 'always "gone against the grain" with him, as he used to say to himself, for he was much given to soliloquizing; and the faith he had in his own destiny was the most striking point about him. He believed that he was some day or other to create a sensation in the world, either by, great wealth, genius, or per- haps by the combined operation of both. So one summer morning, just as the down was beginning to sprout on his chin, be threw away the ox-gad and started off from his native valley, keep- ing a westerly course, as far as the town of Portchester, in the State of New York. There it was that he first met Dick; and it is more than likely he would hlave gone on without noticing him, had not the child's face been turn. ' . \   ed toward the East. Immediately the : young man's heart was filled with com- passiot., and he stopped and com- menced interrogating him ; and when he learned that he, too, was seeking his fortune, penniless and without friends, he offered "to take him under his protec- tion; but at the same time expressed his disapprobation at the direction he was traveling. "Always point the way the sun goes," he said, "and you'll fetch up right in the end j West is the way to glory, sure." Now this was all moonshine to Dick, whose risibles were no little excited, and yet he politely thanked his new-made friend at the same time, for his ad- vice -and kind offer of protection, and forthwith commenced addressing him as "cousin." The volume which Dick is at this moment poring over, is one on natural history, illustrated ; and every now and then he interrupts his friend by reading aloud some passage in rela- tion to lions and tigers, and then ques- tioning him as to whether he has ever seenany of these beasts.. For some time Nat paid but little attention to him, but at last shook his head impatiently and told him to close the book and come and help him. But although not in reality indolent, the lad seemed indis- posed to enter into any other employ-. ment. "Well, I will assist you present- ly," he replied, "but I must first read this chapter to sister," as he called Ellen; "I'm certain she's never heard about crocodiles, and it will teach her something new." Accordingly, he walk- ed round to the front of the house, and began reading to his adopted sister, and she listened attentively, for she loved the sound of his voice, and thought Gregory was hardly excusable in except- :ing to his engaging in his favorite em- tployment.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7736-00000012"/> "Oh sister!" he exclaimed when he had finished, "I do wish -I could travel to these distant countries; I wish, too, that I had a library, and that I knew everything!"And he concluded the sen- tence with a sigh, as though realizing how impossible it would be for him ever to accomplish all he desired. "Yes, I rwill become a learned man," he continued; "I shall write a book as big as this, myself, one of these days; and  you, sister, shall read it. But, Ellen, dear Ellen,- what makes you cry?': "Nothing, nothing," said the young woman, brushing a tear away and trying to resume her knitting. The. truth is, she was-thinling of what her lot might be in case she should lose her sight, and Dick's remark that she should read his book brought this reflection before her with terrible force. Thus far she had been able to work for Nat and the lad, cooking  the  meals, mending  their clothes, and keeping the household in order; in fact, assisting mattrially in "  making both ends meet." But should she become blind, all that w-ould be at an en-d, and then she would only be a 1 helpless creature, a clog; and if the . young mai were still to insist on sup- i porting her, ought she to allow him to 1 do so?   But supposing he were to die i 1 what then?   And as this idea passed t through her mind she pictured to her- self the poor-house, with the big-headed 1 idiots, and seemed to again hear the c howling of the maniac in his lonely i cell.                S "  God's will be done," she said at last, o making another effort to resume her c knitting, and feeling ashamed that she n had manifested so much anxiety in rela- C tion to her eye-sight. Was not her con- 1( dition infinitely better than that of hun- ti dreds and thousands-of others, who at a   ie this moment were lying in hospitals, in el lunatic asylums, in prisons, and with no D, kind friend near, no birds to sing for w them, no beautiiul sun-flowers, no dli. i- cious breezes to fan their wearied g bodies; in fact, with nothing of lihat r she beheld around her in this home which Nat"had provided, as she more "than suspected, expressly for her; and s when she reflected on this, she deter- ; mined not to have so much solicitude , about the future. That was in God's I keeping, and as lie willed it, so should she cheerfully submit. In the mean- k, while, Gregory was still busy with his , show cart, working like a good fellov, and, as usual, soliloquizing. "Really," said he, stopping a moment to admlfire the birds and animals which were placed on three or four small shelves, ,( really, these ought to bring me a nice sum, and the-money will go a good ways toward getting her  a better bedstead, and Richard needs shoes and a desk of his own, where he can keep his books and his curiosities. I hope what he reads won't turn his brain and start him off in search of giraffes and lions. Humph! though I don't do much of it myself I wish he'd take to reading scripture in- stead of natural history. Indeed, I almost believe it's only Lizzie Onderdonk keeps him as quiet as he is. Yes, he'd travel if it wasn't for her." While he is thus speaking to himself let us examine his collection. There, on the topmost shelf of the cart and rlght in the middle, stands a  crow, lookitng' solemn enough to be Poe's raven. On one side of him is a saucy blue jay with crest erect and a  chestnut in his beak, making one think of frosty mornings in October. Then comes a glorious yel- low-hammer, the largest and most beau- tiful of all our wood-peckers; next to him a black bird, with scarlet epaulets, put-   ting you In mind of swamps and retired places, where he loves in the summer time to chatter away and give his wild whistle. Then on the other side of the crow behold that bobolink, with wings half spread as if he were just alighting in the midst of the clover; and there, too, is the oriole rejoicing in the gaudy colors of Lord Baltimore. On the low- er shelves are a number of other birds, amongst them a wood-cock, looking stupid enough, with those eyes set so far back in his head; but remember that they serve a useful purpose in the leafy days of July,when the gunner approaches him from the rear. There, too, is a quail, and you almost fancy you can hear him calling out " bob-white" as he sits upon some mossy stone wall enjoying as much as yourself the smell of new-mown hay. In the collection there are likewise a few stuffed animals; and of them all ,there is none more beautiful than the pole-cat, vulgularly called skunk; and as we mention the name do not roll up your eyes in horror, gentle reader. Near him is a black snake coiled up into the shape of a huge nest, with his half open mouth turned toward you. How terrible! you exclaim; and yet he would flee from your very shadow. He is satisfied if he can only get a frog or a field-mouse fcr his breakfast. It was Gregory's intention to set out on his tour through the country in a few days, and he doubtless might have been ready by this very morning had not Dick persuaded him to delay a little until he might procure him a new and wonderful animal which the lad declar- ed would astonish the public and bring probably more money than all thd rest of the collection put together. But where it was to be found he did not seem inclined to tell. He had, however, promised to trap it immediately.   We will here inform you, reader, that among the few objects which Prudence Mather cherished on earth, came first and foremost a giant tom-cat, which had already reached an advanced age; in- deed, nobody appearied to remember when or where it was born. It had been a great favorite with- her brother Har- vey, and the old maid used often to say that since the afternoon when he drown- ed himself it had not been. the same creature. Dick had become aware of its exist- ence only a couple of weeks ago, while he was out in the woods searching for birds' nests; and as he had been reading lately about catamounts and panthers, the idea had occurred to him that it might easy be made to pass for some very rare beast, especially if a little dis- guised. H-e had accordingly resolved to capture it on the first good opportu- nity, and had only been waiting for the full moon, when he would probably find it prowling about the old maids' garden. 'To tell the truth, he did not care to go too near the stone house in the dark; not that he was a coward, but he had overheard Abigail telling Ellen of certain mysterious things which took place there; and being gifted with a strong imagination, and knowing that a suicide had once been committed in the mill-pond, only a powerful motive could have prompted him to such an under- taking. In days gone by, Gerard Fow- ler had more than once remarkied to Norris, while they were seated around the green-covered table carousing with their friends, how like the animal was to Prudence. It certainly had her eyes, and on its forehead were the same wrinkles; and as it used to sit watching the cards, the miller half believed it was the soul of some departed gambler come back: to earth in cat-form. Of course the-  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7736-00000013"/> young man had ridiculed such an idea, and the miller had generally ended the matter by tossing off another glass of   wine and then chasing the cat into the pantry, where it could no longer stare him out of countenance.   CHAPTER IV.   AROUND the old maids' home it was always gloomy, but never so much so as on the evening succeeding the one on which they were first intro/ duced to us ; at least Abigail, whose nature was much more sensitive than her sister's, fancied it was the case. Perhaps it was because the tide in' Hutchison's Creek had reached the edge of the road which divided high water mark from the haugh-haugh wall in front of their dwelling; reminding her that it had just risen to this point when her poor brother was last seen alive, walking rapidly towards the mill. In former times Ellen Fowler and her parents were wont to sit upon the green and watch the waters coming in and going out; and the child would wonder why the creek did not always remain full, so that her father's skiff might float continuously. ( At that period the windows of the mansion were not kept closed as at pre- sent, and the birds loved to have their nests as close to it as possible, while many a young fish hawk was hatched in the dead pine tree yonder. The loneli- ness of the place served to depress the spirits of Abbe, and she sought relief therefrom in visiting Nat Gregory's cabin to enjoy a little of the happy life which prevailed there. Here she was constant- ly picturing to herself Harvey's corpse as it lay upon the bank with a fifty pound weight fastened around the waist, his hinds grasping a bunch of eel grass, his glassy eyes staring at her; and, anon, -   the coroner bending over him, while the ' jury exchanged solemn glances, expres- sive of their conviction that " the way Jof the transgressor is hard." But it was very fortunate for the sis- ters that they were able to live alone and get along without .hired help; for what "Biddy" or even native Jemima could have been induced to pass two successive nights in this abode, no mat- ter how high the wages?. But even if the place had not been rendered horri- ble by the rappings and the moving of furniture, the sisters would not have -dared to introduce into the house any strangers, lest a certain secret, on the safe keeping of which perhaps even their lives depended, might be discov- ered. It was now Spring-time, however, and as their household duties precluded-the possibility, even if their physical strength- would admit of it, of performing the more laborious part of garden-making themselves, they were under the neces- sity of employing some one to at least spade the ground, form the beds, and plant the seeds. Living so remotely from all others, except Nat Gregory and the family of which he was the acknowl- edged head, the spinsters sometimes found it difficult to procure the needed assistance. Indeed, Nat Gregory, the self sacrificing and accommodating stuf- fed bird hawker, was the only one they could rely upon in an emergency of this kind; and such was his regard for Abbe, induced by the kind feeling she had manifested for the young woman he had  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7736-00000014"/> taken under his fostering care, that, when he was not otherwise employed, he was always ready to assist these lonely maidens in every time (of need. At the time of which we now speak, Nat was awaiting the arrival of the won- derful animal which the young Natural- ist, Dick, had wished him to include in his " curiosity shop," previously to set- ting out on his tour, and he therefore readily responded to Abbe's demand for assistance in the garden. "Well," said Abbe to Prudence as they were seated in the evening behind the house, "Mr. Gregory has worked hard to-day in the garden, spoken but little, and what's more I noticed that he had cotton stuffed in his ears, so I am * sure he heard nothing." "Yes, "replied the other, l"he's- pleased me, too, thus far," adjusting the red ribbon :around 'Tommy's neck, as her favorite cat was called, and then giving it a kiss on the, nose, "but we mustn't forget he's a down-easter, and them folks has awful keen eyes; and if he once took a notion to pry into what goes on inside, we'd have to pay him his wages and start him off directly. As for spirits scaring : himiz, why, he'd like nothing better than 1 tc investigate the rappings and table- 1 turnings, and then go about the country i lecturing on the subject"     ( A  long pause followed this remark, t during which the cat several times rais- ( ed its head and appeared to be gazing I at something  in the garden; and to f quiet it, Prudence was obliged to kiss it s aTain and again, and fondle it in her t arms as if it were an infant.   f For neamly an hour they remained a thus seated, side by side, Abigail half asleep, and her sister only kept awake r by the fidgeting of her pet, which had t become  so extremely restless that she I had to let it jump down from her lap,. o   t, when it immediately trotted off towards i, the spot where Nat had left his spade e and wheelbarrow after the completion  of his day's work. "'When you went to look for our - gardener," said Prudence, at lengt,l - yawning, "how, did he appear? Conr- tented or not? That cabin where he lives is such a small, miserable abode for a person so energetic and ambitious as he seems to be." Before the younger sister answered this question she heaved a deep sigh, and from the bottom, of her heart wished that she could change places with Nat. "Happy as a king," she said at length, after summoning sufficient courage, for she knew well enough these words would provoke  Prudence's wrath. "Every- thing in the house and around it looked clean and neat as wax; he was working at some kind of a cart, Ellen was cook- ing the dinner, and the lad was pei checd upon the stone wall reading; and all did seem so different from " . "Oh stop! you needn't go any fur- ther," exclailned Prudence ;" it's just as I supposed; you've got twisted on the subject of Ellen Fowler, and think that her home is better than your own. The huzzy, the hypocrite! to be going so regular to church, leaning on-Mr. Gleg- ory's arm, making believe she's gelting blind! and still to lead the life Lhj does! It's a scandal ; and I must b ing public opinion to bear upon her, and her friend ought td go and get married to some decent body. Better for his repu- tation; and besides, what foolishness for him to work his fingers ofil for such a person." And' thus she went on applying op- probrious epithets to the miller's daugh- ter, which we will not attempt to repeat But what, it may be asked, was the cause of the bitter hatred she entertained to-   wards Ellen? It was the working of the old maid's conscience, kind reader, if we may be permitted to say that her conscience was at all impressible. It re- minded her of the ruin which her brother Harvey and (herself had brought upon the young woman's father; and now to see Ellen living in such a lowly condi- tion, so near to her old home, was more than she could stand without a feeling of remorse. "1I never thought much of the girl, any how," she resumed, after muttering something to herself, "even when she was more innocent, and considerably better looking than she is to-day. She toolk after her father, was forever hang- ing about the tavern door, and more than once I saw Alexander Norris wink- ing at her." "Perhaps she wanted to get her fa- ther away from the gambler's room, and don't you think she was right?" said Abbe. "I declare!" cried the other, this time ,. really provoked, "If you wern't my sister, I'd-well, I'd vow never to speak to you again. One might suppose that you never had'anything to do with that affair. But remember you are just as guilty as I am; and which ever way -it all ends, you must stand by me; it's too late to repent." "Oh no, no!" sobbed Abigail; "re- lease the prisoner and confess tie crime! Do anything, rather than live as at pre- sent!" ' The elder sister gave partial vent to her feelings in a scornful laugh, after wlhich there was an interval of silence. One of the old maids began scratching her nose, while the other sighed, and longed for the day when their troubles would end. The silence was broken by Prudence resuming the conversation, but she now assumed a much softer tone,   as if she were sorry for having spoken so harshy. "I Bwonder whether Mr. 'Gregory could be persuaded to come and take up his quarters with us? I say this for your sake, Abbe, as I know the house is lonesome, and one more person in it would make a considerable difference. As for his getting any knowledge of the fool up in the North-east room, I think I can manage that. Humph! if it hadn't been for you, he wouldn't have staid there so long, I'd have--" "Huh, hush!" interrupted Abbe; "go on and speak about Mr. Greg- ory." "Well, as I remarked, he might come and live with us altogether, especially if he had the habit of keeping cotton in his ears; but even if he hasn't, I can contrive some new place where the crazy man can be kept when he's noisy, so that his voice never will reach anybody. Mr. Gregory being a down easter, can no doubt turn his hand to anything; and the mill, with a little repairing, may be made to pay again. Suppose you sound him to-morrow on the subject and see what he says; as for wages, offer' him whatever he asks." This concession on the part of Pru- dence surprised the youngei sister, and yet it gave her but little consolation, for she felt sure Nat would not listen for a moment to such a proposition, even should she, have the boldness to make it. For would it not be heartless, nay almost wicked, to ask him to leave Ellen Fowler, to whom he had kindly given shelter from the blasts of winter; for whom he had toiled to procure a comfortable subsistence, and over whom he had thrown thq aegis of his protec- tion-the only friefd she had on earth, and without whose aid she would be compelled to drink still deeper of the  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7736-00000015"/> cup of affliction? If it appears strange that the village people had shown a coldness and indifference toward the hapless young woman, know; reader, that it is attributable to Prudence Mather's tongue, which could fabricate more scandal and enunciate more false- hoods in one hour than any other moi-tal could in a day. Just now a loud yell from the cat brought the elder sister to her feet ; and listening attentively, she fancied that she could hear some one running down the lane. "'Tis only some strange puss come to pay him a visit, and it's a cry of joy," said Abbe, chuckling; for to tell the truth, she hated the beast, and hoped that some casualty might have overtaken it. No, no!" exclaimed the other, "no cats ever come to see my Tommy; he's as lonely here as you or I. "Tommy, Tommv, Tommy," she yelled, but there was no response. All was silent; and after hunting through the garden,in vain, for nearly a quarter of an hour, Prudence threw herself down again into the chair, where she began  repeating the word "Tommy," every now and then varying it with "Pussy," evidently in no humor . to be interrupted. "It's time," she said, at last, shaking 1 her sister's arm (for Abbe was beginning to doze) it's time to give the prisoner his  supper. Mind and make the tea weak, ( or he'll be awake all night, singing." I "Weak "  thought the other, as she s arose to obey. "Ha!"I wonder if his v tea was ever anything but dish water?"  In about ten minutes Abigail, with a t tray in her hand, on which was placed l a  slice of bread and a blue earthen- h ware cup and saaucer, the cup contain- t ing a very poor apology for tea, might t have been seen mounting the stair-case. tl On reaching the second story she turn- y   re ed to the left, and after groping her a way slowly along for a few steps (Pru- ie dence would not allow a light in the r, passage) and grumbling at the darkness, We she placed the tray down on the floor e and went back to the kitchen to procure - a lamp, thus disregarding the injunctions L1 of her sister, it is true, but Abbe was ev- 1 idently growing restive under restraint, 3 and resolved, for once, to have her own e way. Presently she returned with one, e and picking up the tea things, continued on towards the north-east room; on  reaching the approach to which, she took a key from her pocket, unlocked the door, and entered the room. I  The  apartment in which she now found herself was quite broad, but with a low ceiling; and the moonlight as it streamed in through the single open window, made it appear much better than in the day time, for the 'stains on the carpet and the cob- webs in the corners were hot observable on the floor, were five long dark streaks, the shadows of the same num- ber of firmly fastened iron bars, set far enough  back from the window to pre- vent anybody noticing them fromn the outside, and so placed as to render it impossible for the person confined there to escape. Seated by a small table, in the middle of the room, and wrapped in a loose dressing gown, was an emaciated being, who looked up at first with an idiotic stare as Abbe approached, and his hands were shaking so violently that he could hardly hold the cards with which he had been amusing himself. But in a  mo- ment he smiled and bowed, and, rising, helped place the tray on the table, at the same time informing the old maid that he had been playing "solitaire;" then seizing her by the sleeve, " Have you seen her?" he exclaimed eagerly;   "has she not arrived? it's high time she had; why don't she come?"Now these were the same questions which he always put to Abigail whenever she appeared, so that she had at last grown accustomed to them,and scarcely noticed him when he addressed her. On this occasion, however, he was rather more  im portunate than usual, and would be satisfied with nothing short of a reply to his questions; so, to quiet him, she told him that the lady (but to whom he alluded she had not the remotest idea) would positively arrive in the morning. "Oh, it's been so often to-morrow, and to-morroW, and to-morrow, and she hasn't come yet," he exclaimed with a deep sigh. "Dear Emma! but I know she has forgiven me. Yes-hark! don't you hear her?" and. as he spoke he turned and looked towards the window. "Yes, hark!" he repeated, almost tearing her sleeve. "Don't you hear Emma's voice?" , For nearly a minute he remained lis- tening. He scarcely breathed; not a cricket was chirping, not a mouse knaw- ing, and the stillness was only broken by the wind, which produced a melan- choly moaning sound around the corner of the building. Presently looking again at Abbe, and shuffling the half dozen well-finger- ed diamonds and spades which formed his sole amusement, "Why will you not come and play cards with me now and then?" he said; "t'would bring old times back; I'm tired to death of " solitaire." Won't you sing something? Old hundred will do, if you can't give me anything from Don Giovanni." At these words she burst into a laugh; but quickly recovering her gravity, she bade him make haste and eat his supper. "My supper," he cried in an indig-   nant tone, and gesticulating so violently as almost to upset the table, " why, where are the oysters and the lobster salad? Bah! this ain't my supper." Then straightening himself up and extending both his arms, he began to sing from the opera of Don Juan that jovial air commencing: "]inchze dact ving calda hau la teslta;' and in such a loud voice that his attend- ant was apprehensive that he would be heard by some fancied eaves-dropper. When he had finished he made a low bow, then clapping his hands he cried out "Bravo! en core!" and forthwith be- gan again to sing. The old maid patted him on the should- er and implored him to be still, and at last wept, for she was afraid her sis- ter might wonder what detained her so long. But all in vain; her entreaties could not silence him; and finally,' in despair, she took up the lamp, and be- stowing a look of pity upon him, turn- ed on her heel and left the room, of course locking the door after her. In another moment, however, it was opened again, and this time it was Prudence who appeared, holding in her right hand a switch, and frowning ter- ribly. The unhappy prisoner at once lowered his voice, clenched his fists and muttered something which did not reach her ears, sharp as they were. "Stop your jabbering!" she cried, advancing boldly and inflicting upon the back of the poor maniac a blow with the switch which caused him to wince. "If it wasn't for Abbe, I'd put you where you'd never trouble me any more; but I guess I won't listen to her merciful' advice much longer. " So thoroughly did her presence awe him, that after she had left he sat silent- ly by the table for almost an hour, occa- sionally brushing away a tear and turn-  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7736-00000016"/> ing towards the window, exclaiming "hark! hark!" for he still fancied he heard a voice. As soon as Abigail had returned down stairs, she commenced preparing the supper for herself and sister; and while 'thus engaged she wondered how many more such years she would have to spend in this place. "Hasn't Tommy come back?" she enquired when Prudence entered with the switch in her hand, twirling it as if she were longing to lay it on somebody's back.               j "Breathe not his name!" reponded ' the elder sister. "Oh! if I find out that i she's had anything to do with it, I'll fix I her 1"  -    "Of whom are you speaking?", asked e Abbe. "Of that huzzy, Ellen Fowler; I sus- n pect she's got Dick to come here and e kill my darling." "Never I She wouldn't dream of such ' a thing.'", "Oh! there you are again. I declare your heart's too tende'r for anytling. Let me tell you, Abbe, she hates us, or me-any how, like poison; and t'would be exactly like her to tell that young vagabond to do it. She's happy, is she, in that cabin? And she says to you, 'God's will be done,' eh! when she speaks about those eyes of hers? Ha! But I'll be even with her for this, see if I don't."   CHAPTER V.-   A MONG the few persons whom Pru- dence Mather cared about asso- ciating with in East Chester, was a wid- ower by the name of Solomon Onder- donk. He it was whom her brother Harvey had never been able to entice across the threshold of his tavern, as he had done so many others; and yet, far from disliking hiln on that account, the old maid had always secretly admired him for his shrewdness. s"He has money," she would say, " and he knows how to keep it." This man had, on a certain important occasion, rendered her and Havey a service ; for which, were she to live a hundre&amp; years, she felt that she collld not be too grateful. What this secret service was we will learn by and by. He was well to do in the world, having made a considerable amount of nmoney as a distiller; and since retiring from business, which was about ten years ago, he had built himself a large and costly mansion, half a mile beyond the village, on the road leading to New Rochelle.  It was a structure of no small degree of pretension, painted white, with four Grecian columns in front, and on the top a capacious cupola. Its site was a commanding one; and there being no tree within a hundred yards of it, it attracted the attention of all who came into the vicinity; and this, really, seemed to be the object of the proprietor, who evidently wished to excite the admiration of the passers by.  The only thing about the mansion which ever disturbed Solomon, was the thought that he did not own the soil   upon which it was built, for this had belonged to his deceased wife; and she, on her death bed, had willed it to her daughter. The lightning rod that ran up its sides ended in four prongs, long and slender, like Prudence Mather's fingers; which, by the way, were to him objects of the greatest admiration. In fact, from the moment when these two beings became acquainted, it would seem as if a magnetic current had begun to flow from one heart to the other, so that whenever the retired dis- tiller suffered from palpitations, the old maid suffered likewise. This mutual sympathy had unfortunately manifested itself before the demise of Mrs. Onder- donk, and had doubtless hastened that good woman's exit from scenes terrestial; and since that moment it had gone on steadily increasing,. year by year. 'In appearance Mr. Onderdonk was one of those individuals-whom no amount of roast beef or plum pudding can ever make fat. His cheeks had a yellowish hue, tinged occasionally with green (especially in the spring of the year, when he was troubled with a plethora of bile). Ite was also very fond of- being alone; and whenever he went to the village, his eyes were either down- cast or fixed apparently upon some object straight ahead of him, as though he feared lest he should be impeded in his progress by some "button - holing" acquaintance. This moroseness had won for him the name of "grumpy Solomon," and this apellation had cut him to the quick ; for, although not of  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7736-00000017"/> a disposition inclining him to mix freely with his neighbors, he still had a great horror of being considered unpopular; and he would have given anything in the world if the saucy schoolboys had not thus 'nicknamed him. Morever, to aggravate the matter, he had so far erred in judgment as to evince displeasure at these applications of an opprobrious epithet to him; and several times he had even given chase to a crowd of the young rascals, cane in hand, and breathing dire vengeance should he catch any of them. Sud- denly, however, within the last week, all this became - changed ; and for his deliverance he was indebted to no less a personage than Dick, "lazy Dick," the "bookworm," as Gregory called him; who, for ulterior purposes, had resolved to get upon the sunny side of this cross-grained man. How it occur- ed was as follows: The lad, accom- panied by a number of others, who tacitly recognized him as their leader, happened to meet the distiller on the road one morning, looking glum as usual, and grasping tightly his walking stick as if all prepared to resent the first impudent word that might escape them. Indeed, "grumpy Solomon" was at the end of more than one of their tongues, when Dick, in a clear, bold voice, and with a slight inclination of the head, greeted him with "good morn- ing, Colonel," laying, as he spoke, great stress upon the last word. The effect which this produced on Mr. Onderdonk was far greater than Dick even supposed it would be; yes, it was positively magical. The greenish hue disappeared fr6m his face at .once; his rigid mouth relaxed into something like a smile; and as he continued his way, the look .   r which he gave the lad was full of thle deepest gratitude. "Colonel," he re- ; peated, raising his eyes from the ground, and endeavoring to assume a military air, " well, that's a name to be proud of. how thankful I am to him for calling me this. Gad! 'anything rather than "Grumpy." Oh, Dick, why didst thou not do this long ago? Mrs. Onder- donk might then have been still among the living; for nothing had contributed so much to her last illness as her husband's constant ill-humor, which was of course aggravated by the nickname the boys had-given him. The cruel man had even accused her once of bribing them to do it; and to vent his spite upon her, he had sent word to Prudence Mather to come and pass the day at his house; and the invitation, which was afterwards often repeated, had never been  refused. Once only did his wife timidly remon- strate, reminding him that he was not living under the cld dispensation, which countenanced a plurality of wives.' But her words produced not the slightest effect; and when the old maid heard about it she grinned, and bade him tell her that their intimacy indicated noth- ing more than Platonic affection. It was the very next, day after the strange disappearance of the tom-cat, that Prudence, having harnessed the nag with her own hands, drove off in the ancient family gig towards the village to pay a visit to Mr. Onderdonk. On the way she halted for a few mo- ments, in front of Gregory's cabin, for she knew that the -young man was absent, being at work in her own garden, and that consequently she might say disagreeable things to Ellen Fowler with impunity. "How be your eyes getting on, Miss?' she commenced. "Better not use 'em   too much;- knitting's bad, and you oughtn't to read, either. In fact, you hadn't ought to use 'em at all; for if once they're lost, no doctor can fetch 'em back." "I cannot say that my sight is any better," replied the young woman, slow- ly advancing along the path between the sun-flowers. But, thank God, I am still able to see a little." "Humph! be careful of 'em, though, for they're precious. Pretty hard scratching to git along here, I guess, eh-? groceries and everything so high. How is your cow?" "Oh she is doing well, and we have as much milk as we need. It was the nicest present he could have made me." "He! who's he-?' "Why, Mr. Gregory," answered Ellen, beginning to feel 'hurt at the sharp tone in which'she was addressed. "But I don't see no pasture land; i where do you keep the critter?',  I "We let her run loose and pick up 1 what she can along the lane ; she never v strays far."            t "But I wonder you ain't afraid some- h body will put her in the pound; you li know these animals ain't allowed to go o about the public road that way."  u "True enough that might happen, but en then she really does no harm; and be- a sides, who would trouble our cow? tl Folks know we are poor."      pi "Well, perhaps public opinion ain't w noticed it yet, and so perhaps you'll th escape. Good bye. Mind what I said sh about your eyes, or you may lose 'em gi sooner than you think for." And with le this consoling remark she gave the reins ag a jerk and the horse trotted on towards he Eastchester. As she proceeded she thought over by in her mind what would be the best and wa easiest method of getting rid of Ellen 'of   )u' Fowler's presence'; for, as we have al- )u ready intimated, she could not bear to if see her every time she went to the village. in Callous though she appeared, and able through srer strong will to prevent' any ty open manifestation of remorse, she still v- had a conscience which smote her in se, n cret. Now it happened that the acre of n land on which Gregory had built his house belonged to Mr. Onderdonk, who I, had rented it to him for a rather moder- d ate sum, payable!monthly in advance, , with the understanding that when he  should move away, whatever improve- ments might have been made upon it e should remain and be considered part i of the property. Supposing, therefore, ' that he were to' receive from his land- lord a notice to quit, and at the same , time be offered a permanent situation down by the creek, and were he to accept it, would not the young woman ; in that case find herself in an awkward predicament, left all alone with Dick? And was it not probable that he, too, would then go off somewhere else, and thus compel her to return to the pauper's home at Wfiite Plains? for- it was not likely that any respectable person would offer her shelter after public opinion,  which had already been slightly agitat- ed, should have become thoroughly aroused ; and certainly it would not be the fault of the old maid's tongue if the proper amount of falsehoods about Ellen were not scattered broad-cast among the inhabitants of Eastchester. And as she thus communed with herself, the gig rattled along, her nose itched vio- lently, and she scratched it again and again, so that any body acquainted witl her ways might have known that she was in a rarely good humor. By and by the white building with the cupola was reached, and jumping nimbly out of the vehicle, she fastened her steed to  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7736-00000018"/> a post and then advanced with a palpi- tating heart towards the door. In order to effect an entrance it was not neces- sary to knock, or even pull the bell, for the widower, who had seen her coming through one of the parlor blinds, in an instant stood before her, dressed as usual in a faded " swallow-tailed" coat with brass buttons, and on his feet a pair of elegantly embroidered slippers, a gift from one who felt for him a great deal of platonic affection. Close behind him stood a girl, perhaps fifteen or six- teen years of age, and of a most strik- ing appearance. Her complexion was dark, her eyes black, sparkling, and fringed with unusually long and droop- ing lashes; while her raven hair, which hung down almost to her waist, was fastened behind with a small blue ribbon. The contrast .between herself and the man was great; while his bilious face lacked soul, and almost sickened one to look at it, she, on the contrary, seemed brim full of spirit, and one ,of those airy beings for whom the longest day is too short, and who never grow tired of laughing and rofnping about. Everybody in Eastchester, and for some distance around, knew Lizzie Onder- donk; and even the most snarling cur would cease barking and wag its tail when she approached. But it was at the village- school that she was the most popular, not only with the pedagogue, who, to tell the truth, admired her more than he dared confess, but with the many boys and girls who frequented this humble institution,which is still to be seen standing at the forks of the road near the Episcopal church, and with the same old willow tree bend- ing over it. When Jack, the dunce, did not know what figures to chalk down on the black-board, it was Lizzie's fingers that signalled them to him; and if Mary   Ann stammered and bit her lips in her efforts to remember the name of the longest river in the United States, it Mwas * the same black eyed girl. who whispered the answer. There it was that she had made the acquaintance of Dick; who, during the winter season, was always very regular in his attendance; in fact, he never had missed a single recitation, except when Gregory was obliged to be away, when of course he would remain at home to assist Ellen. Almost without knowing it, these two had fallen in love with each other. Their tastes were much the same. Both were fond of nature, and saw in the trees and purling brooks, the birds and the wild flowers, a beauty which others did not; and as they rambled through the woods, and along the quiet country lanes, often hand in hand, you might have taken them for brother and sister, It was- Lizzie who lent him the books, on Natural History, which he used to read with such avidity. And it was in order that she might become proud of him, as a learned youth, more than for any other reason, that he passed so many hours daily poring over their pages. There, was, however, one person who had never liked the girl; perhaps because her merry laugh .broke too harshy upon ears that had grown ac- customed to solitude. Prudence Mather could not bear her; and although Lizzie was fearless enough' by nature, she still never found herself in this woman's presence without, a feeling of dread, for which she could not account; and had it not been for her father, who would have   reprimanded her severely, she would, at the moment of which we are speaking, have run up stairs and hidden herself in her bed room.   I We believe it will not lessen the interest of our story if we reveal the fact that Lizzie was only an adopted daughter. The late Mrs. Onderdonk had never had any offspring of her own, and had so many times sighed for an object which she might caress and love, especially since her husband cared so little about her, that in a thoughtless moment Solomon had promised to find and adopt a young child; and accord- ingly, after not a very long search, he had procured one, which, in the course of a few years, grew up into this hand- some girl, whom Prudence is now eye- ing so intently. "Why do you dodge behind your parent, Miss, every time I take the pains to come and pay you a visit?" exclaimed the old maid, with a frown, while her right hand was resigned to Mr. Onder- donk's affectionate grasp. "I have noticed that myself, more than once," he remarked, turning partly around and frowning too; for even in this trifling matter, he was anxious to prove how perfectly he agreed with her; "and it must be stopped." "Oh, I'll tell you what will cure her,', continued Prudence, "let her spend a couple of weeks, or a month, at my house. I could stuff her ears with cot- ton, if you think hearing the spirits would affect her nerves." "No, don't, my dear, she'd like the change; she is so fond of moving about, and it would suit your Tommy exactly; he needs a playmate. At the mention of her lost pet, Miss Mhather gave a groan, leaned heavily on his arm a moment, then staggered towards the chair. "Run for a tumbler of water, quick!" cried Mr. Onderdonk, who believed she was fainting. In a second or two, Lizzie returned   with one, and handed it tremblingly to her father. And as she did so, the woman's weird countenance seemed to throw a spell upon her-it looked so ghastly; and all the horrid stories she heard Dick tell about the place where- the old maid dwelt, came rushing through her mind, and she almost was afraid she would faint herself "Solomon," said the woman, after moistening her lips, "I am better now. It was only a momentary weakness. Suppose we go into the sitting room, where we can be by ourselves; I want to talk to you about several matters of importance." The hint sufficed. It was to him a command, and Lizzie at once withdrew and went out upon the porch, where she could breathe the fresh air and feel happy again. "Now, sir," resumed Prudence, after they had ensconced themselves side by side on the sofa; first, however, taking off her bonnet, in order that he might have a good view of her beautiful brown wig, "I flatter myself there is- nothing in this world you admire so much as a virtuous woman." Here she paused, just long enough for him to begin wondering what on earth she could be driving at, then con- tinued: "Therefore I take the liberty of suggesting that Nat Gregory, whose cabin, or whatever you choose to call the ugly thing he lives in, which stands on your land, be told to leave after this quarter. Not that there is anything very sinful about him, for I know what men folks is, and can make allowances for them; but there is somebody living with him I don't fancy a bit. I mean Ellen Fowler, the daughter of the old fool who went to the dogs here a good many years ago, and died in the poor- house. Still, it's not because I care  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7736-00000019"/> what the huzzy does that I mention this, but public opinion is beginning to express itself; and I've heard more persons than one say it's wonderful strange Mr. Onderdonk, so moral him- self, should permit a scandal like that on property which belongs to him ; for mind you, Ellen Fowler ain't regularly married to Gregory." While she was speaking, the little finger of her left hand had gradually worked its way through one of the but- ton holes of his coat, so that the throb- bing of his heart, almost ready to burst with "platonic affection," could be dis- tinctly felt, and. she chuckled at the power which she exercised over him. i"You're a popular man in the town- ship, Solomon,': she continued, after again waiting a moment for him to digest what had been said, " especially with the females. And it's all on account of your steady, sober habits. They never see you intoxicated, or hanging around the tavern door; and let me tell you, to be a model man is something to be proud of, and I am proud of you." Here she :smiled so sweetly that the retired distil- ler almost felt like kneeling down and adoring her. To have refused her any- thing, at this moment, would .have been utterly impossible. "And when you give that fellow notice to quit," she continued, " you may tell him there is a first rate situation to be had with me and Abbe; easy work and good wages; so that I think he'll not feel so bady about moving. I have al- ready told sister to propose it to him; but it's likely that until he hears from you, he won't accept the offer. By c bringing a little pressure to bear, how- ,ever, all will work right." "Prudence, darling, I shall do as you s ,wish."              a "Very good, Solonmon. And now let x   i me speak of another matter. Folks in ) the village are complaining about Ellen Fowler's cow; mind you it belongs to I her, and nobody else ; that I'm certain - of. The critter is allowed to graze on the t high road, and is very wild, and only * yesterday came near hooking a child. So please see that it is put iii the pound. You can do it afore night, eh?" "It shall be done." "Well, Solomon, really this pleases me. But there is yet one more thing I have to mention, and it is very painful indeed, for it is connected with an ob- ject very close to my heart. Tommy, my dear Tommy, has disappeared; killed or stolen I can't tell which. And I do believe that Dick, the lad who ives with Ellen and Gregory, has caused the mischief, prompted of course by the huzzy. Now, sir, public opinion is be- ginning to think it strange that a gen- tleman of your position should allow a young vagabond like him to associate with Lizzie. It's true the girl ain't real- ly your own daughter; but as long as you act as her parent, you are respon- sible for her bringing up. So let me take her home for a month or two. In that time he will probably forget her, and become intimate with somebody else. Besides, Abbe is anxious to have a companion. . She finds the place ex- ceeding dull, with only me. Then you can persuade Mr. Gregory to bind the lad'out to some trade." "But, but," exclaimed the widower, looking surprised, " you forget. No, that is impossible.  There's the fool up in the north east room. She'd hear him crying and singing; and, by the way, so would Nat, if he lived there." "Bah! I'll take care of that. Nothing shall be discovered. You see, there's a  large closet ill the crazy man's apart- ment, that, with a little fi ling, will suit   i admirably for putting him in whenever he gets too noisy. I wonder I never thought of it before. Trust me, sir, trust me." "Well, Prudence, I sha l. I did wrong to speak as I did. I lust- con- fess, however, that there are moments when I feel uneasy about Miss Abigail. I don't quite fancy that down-cast ex- pression she has. Can it signify re- pentance? You know she spoke to you once about liberating Norris. Do you think she could play false?" "Never! Not she! That's all im- agination on your part;. sister is true as steel. A little troubled, perhaps, by those mysterious rappings on the wall; and some documents which etre kept locked up in a drawer are often found scattered about the room. But as far as betraying you and me to save herself, why the idea would never enter her brain. What's, more, I guarantee, before a great while, to conquer her scruples, and prevail on her to join us in making a'clean job of it." The old maid having vented a good quantity of spleen, prepared to return home. Mr. Onderdonk had evidently not been benefitted by her visit. He appeared thoughtful; and as he watched her putting on her bonnet and adjusting I her shawl, he heaved a deep sigh.  When he opened the door for her, he i attempted to speak, but could not utter a word. He hesitated-cleared his  throat--tried again to speak, and grew 1 very green in the face; and it was not i until she was seated in the. gig, reins in % hand, and about giving the customary ( jerk, that he was enabled to summon i resolution enough to say in a whisper, c "Dearest"-at the same time casting i: a timid glance over his shoulder, to f make sure no ears but her's were listen- v ing-are you in earnest about. Dick? c l    "Can he be so bad as you imagine? Is it worth while having him sent off to learn a trade? Would it not be better to-to-" "Why, Solomon, you astonish me!" resumed the old maid. "Its only last week I heard you calling that young rascal worse names than ever I did; and now here you are taking his part! What, indeed, is the world coming to? Again he coughed, and his counte- nance grew still more bilious; for, as intimate as were the relations existing between himself and Prudence, he could not bear to confess why it was that at present he liked Dick. Would she not laugh at him if he told her how deeply his heart had been touched by. the lad changing the horrid nickname of "Grumpy Solomon" into "Colonel ;" a name which made him hold his head so high, and throw out his feet to a full twenty-eight inch step? No, he could not unbosom him- self to such a degree, even to her; so he held his tongue. "Mind, now, and do as I wish," she concluded, eyeing him significantly. "We two can't afford to quarrel, eh? Understand? Good bye." Then jerking the reins, off she went, leaving him at the foot of the stoop, looking bewildered, and feeling very much as if he were choking. Just at this moment the storekeeper's son happened to pass along the high road which ran only a short distance from the house, and in a loud, shrill voice, the boy shouted, "Good day, Colonel 1"And as Solomon heard the flattering salutation he groaned, the conviction flashing, upon his mind that if Dick was sent off, the village boys, freed from his wholesome restraint, would relax into their former habit of calling him "Grumpy Solomon." The  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7736-00000020"/> retired distiller, therefore, was in a quandary. He was not possessed of independence enough to resist the de- mands of the vindictive woman who had just left his presence, and yet he was unwilling, for the reason indicated, to comply with her wishes in relation to the polite and considerate youth who held his persecutors in check, nay in- fused into them a seeming respect for himself. He was willing to sacrifice the generous Nat Gregory and the un- fortunate but noble-hearted Ellen Fow- ler, to gratify the maliciousness of the miserable creature who held him spell- bound-for, in doing so, he made no sacrifice of himself-but, in the case of i Dick, he thought if he were not in the I neighborhood, he himself would again i be subjected to the contumely and sport ( of the mischievous urchins that had v rendered his life almost unbearable. ' a   Woman-intelligent, virtuous, and refined--exerts an influence over man which always enures to his well-being; elevates his affections, curbs his pas. sions, and softens his manners. But a man in the leading-strings of a woman debased, is the most pitiable object of which the mind can conceive. Of the latter class was the poor, weal-minded individual, of whose interview with Prudence Mather we have just been remarking. We speak of him as poor; this, of course, does not apply to his worldly possessions, for he had more than a competency-but, in intellect, in moral resources, in those generous impulses which secure respect and love, he was poor indeed. He was, in a word, just such a one as might be easily entrapped in the meshes of a designing woman; and, once in her power,become a willing slave.   CHAPTER VI.   THE morning after Miss Prudence's visit to- Solomon Onderdonk, Ellen Fowler was alone in the cabin, and look- ing rather less cheerful than usual. Her protector, Nat, was engaged in sowing peas and beans for the old maids, and fulfilling more faithfully the promise he had made Abigail, that he would do a week's work in their garden. Dick had gone off in search of the cow, which, strange to relate, had not returned at her usual milking hour the evening be- fore. The lad was afraid something, had happened to the creature, or that she had been shut up in the pound, in which case he would have to let her remain there unless some charitable person should give him the money to procure her release ; for Gregory, unfortunately, had not a dime left in his pocket; the last copper of the happy family having been spetit only yesterday in buying a few groceries. But if she appeared down cast, it was quite otherwise with the robins in the apple tree by the gate. The four tiny blue eggs had, during the preceding night, burst open; and now, were you to raise yourself on tip-t6e and pull the branch down a little, you might behold in the nest four gaping mouths, uttering chirping sounds, the little new-comers driving their mother almost distracted in their demands for "more worms, more worms ;" while, ever since the first dawn of day, her. faithful mate has been piping away as loud as he could, as though he wished to tell the good news to all creation.   The young woman loved to hear his song, which contrasted so strongly with a noise which. every now and then issued from behind the house. There, at the bottom of an old cider barrel, sunk about half way in the earth, was "Tom- 1 my," all chance of escape being pre- j vented by an armful of pea brush placed I across the mouth of the dungeon, and kept down by a heavy stone.  His 'frantic attempts to get out had at first been somewhat startling -to both Nat and Dick; but little by little the beast had grown more subdued, until at length his struggles had almost ceased and his howlings become less fre- quent. Whether Gregory knew to whom the beast belonged, we are not prepared to say; certain it is, however, that he valued it highly, and was not very urgent in his inquiries as to where his protege had procured such a prize. The first thing he had done this morning was to go and crack his knuckles over the bar- rel, in exultation; after which, having called Dick, he explained to him an operation that he thought should be performed on the cat before exposing it to the public gaze. ("Richard," said he, "I am as well aware as you are that this critter is not what might properly be called a wild beast, for they are never caught with velvet collars around their necks; nev- ertheless, if folks can be made to believe it's apanther, or a dwarf tiger, why let 'em go ahead and believe; it wouldn't be the first time the world has been hum-  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7736-00000021"/> bugged. Oh, Richard, I could stand here for an hour and give you a whole sermon on this subject, if I hadn't to go off to work. But I can condense mv "p'ints" together, by saying that people are often made happy by having dust thrown into their eyes. In fact, to be well deceived, is my definition of real happiness. But don't think now that I'm advocating or even excusing the practice of deception. That I wouldn't be guilty of, for anything. But humbug- ging and falsifying are different things entirely; so let us fix up this critter in such a way that folks will believe it's a -a- well, you've been reading Natural history, what shall we call it?" t "Brazilian  Catamount!" exclaimed I the lad, his black eyes sparkling with r delight; and forthwith they had com- t menced changing its iolor by a coat of I red paint, which Nat had prepared for b the wheels of the show-cart.   ' h Its ears were chopped entirely off, n and at least two-thirds of its tail ; and ti so skilfully was this performed, that, by h the time Ellen ran out to see what was sl causing all the hubbub, Tommy  had he been placed down in the barrel again, h; and the culprits were shouting and n throwing stones at an imaginary squir- e\ rel, which, they declared, was scamper- cc ing along the cabin roof. But as we th have remarked, the young woman was of at present alone, and while she plied the broom, sweeping away the feathers su and other rubbish from under Gregory's ho desk, there rose up before her more than int one castle in the air. She pictured to the herself her protector wedded to some bu smart, good looking maiden, one who wh could appreciate him at his true worth, and living in a much better abode than apa this.               par The only fault she had ever found A with Nat was his staying at home even- left   nd ings, instead of going off to ouilting Dle parties, where he might make the ac. go quaintance of some pretty' farners' ny daughters, and perhaps fall in love. )le In this matter Ellen did not entertain Ist one solitary thought about herself. Her be sole desire was to see him happy; and al she believed that a good wife was not at only "a crown to her husband," but ie essentially necessary to his happiness. 't  Prudence Mather remarked to Sol. g- omon Onderdonk that Ellen Fowler :s was "not regularly married to Mr. Greg- n ory."   There was not only no pretense a of this kind, but the idea of becoming il Nat's wife never entered the mind of this pure girl. Several years his senior, 1 her once sweet face disfigured by sick- h ness, and losing day by day her sight, - the bear thought of such a thing would f have been presumptuous in the extreme. rNevertheless, from the bottom of her heart she did love him,. but it partook more of the character of sisterly affec- tion than otherwise. She remembered how he had supported her ever since she had left the county poor-house; how kind, generous, and confiding he had been; stinting himself that her necessities' might be supplied ; and ever checking his first and almost un- controlable impulse to go West, in order that she might dwell amidst the scenes of her childhood. And now, while she is busy sweeping, suppose we examine the interior of her honle. The house is divided, really, into two stories; yet, viewing it from the outside, you might fancy that it had but one, for the only windows are those which open on the ground floor. The first story consists of a single apartment, and is used as dining room, parlor, kitchen, study and work-shop. A ladder stands in the corner at the left hand side, and serves as a staircase   leading to the dormitory above, where Ellen's cot is separated firom the others by a curtain. On the easterly side of the dormitory there are two holes, cut with a jack-knife, and just large enough to admit the sun beams in the morning, so as to awaken "the head of the fam- ily," peradventure he should oversleep himself. As the stovepipe passes through this room, it is during the long winter nights a much more comfortable place to roost (as Dick expresses it) than one might suppose. Fastened to the wall, about half way down the ladder, is a clock with an im- mense pendulum; and although there does not seem to be anything remark- able about its workmanship, still it may possess some little interest when we in- form the reader that Gregory himself made it.. But a clock it was in name only; for, as an indicator of the time it was utterly worthless. Could you hear it striking the hour, you would be unable to repress a smile ; for out of its depths, where moths and spiders have made their nests, there issues a giggling sound, just as though the thing were laughing at the idea of any person being verdant enough to call it a clock. Once Dick had ventured to make sport of it, but in- stantly Ellen's expression of counte- nance indicated that his jeers gave her pain, so he immediately desisted, and declared it was the most perfect chrono- meter in the township. Not far from the foot of the ladder stands Nat's desk, an unpretending piece of furniture, and likewise home- made. It is filled with odds and ends, fish hooks and twine, a chisel and ham- mer, a few nails, and some parcels con- taining ingredients used by him in stuf- fing birds. But the most curious portion of its contents will be found in a paste- board box hidden beneath all the rest. ,   On opening it you behold slips of paper almost innumerable, on each of which ! is written "Nathaniel Gregory," being nothing more nor less than our enter- prising friend's autographs. "You see, Ellen," he said one winter evening, when he was busy writing them, "I feel that I'm destined to become a great man, and so I have resolved to prepare these troublesome things before- hand." When he told her this, we must con- fess that even she could not repress a smile; but as his back was turned at the moment, he was none the wiser. This morning, after she had finished sweeping, and while seated on a bench, resting herself, Dick came running back, whistling a merry tune, with his cap set jauntily on one side of his head, and look- ing like the happiest fellow in the world. "I found her in the pound, sure enough!" he   exclaimed, bouncing through the gate ; "but she's out now; and what's more, feeding on the Colo- nel's grass in his best meadow. Ha I Lizzie's a trump!" "But is not Mr. Onderdonk (for I presume it is he you call ColoneD to be thanked for this?" No, indeed, sister, the old rip I 'Twas all done by Lizzie; she sent for the farmer and told him to go to the pound- master and pay the fine, and then she ordered him to drive the cow into one of her father's clover fields, where she 'is at this moment,--eating faster than she ever did before, to make up for lost Itime. Ha, ha 1" "But what will Mr. Onderdonk say, when he discovers a strange animal pasturing on his land? He certainly will not like it." "I don't believe he will," replied Dick, laughing, "but you must know,  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7736-00000022"/> sister, that I've found out his tender spot, and I'm bound to make the most of it. Yes, if he does turn the creature into the road, I'll make my crowd call him "Grumpy Solomon" again; sure as I'm born I will." He now proceeded to tell Ellen of the difficulty he had experienced in ob- taining an interview with Lizzie, who, it seems, had been forbidden by her foster- parent to leave the house during the day without his permission. Mr. Onderdonk had given this order because he expected the old maid would come and take her away, and he knew that if she strolled off with the lad, as she was inclined to do, he would not lay eyes on her again before sun-down. "But-I did contrive to see her, after all," resumed Dick; " not, however, till I had waited almost an hour, and until "Grumpy" went out for a walk. Then I slipped in by a side door, and I did not go away till the farmer brought us the good news about the cow. Before I left, she lent me another volume of Natural History. Then I gave her such a sweet kiss. Oh! it was worth all the risk of her father's frowns 1" Lizzie, of course, had told him about Prudence's visit, and how the old maid had spoken as if she wanted to have her spend some time down  at the creek. But she had not confided to him how much she dreaded going there, for she knew his temper and was afraid that a  single word spoken by herself against 1 the old maid would increase his already I intense hatred of her.       1 "If she passes even a week in that i gloomy  dwelling, with those two wo- ; men," continued Dick, "she'll not re- i cover from it soon, for it's a devil's i home, and not the place for her. I do i hope she won't go."        I "Oh, you mustn't be too severe in i   r your judgments," replied the young wo. t man. "I'm sure Miss Abigail will treat e her with every consideration, 'and I don't I believe Prudence is as bad as you re- spresent." "Oh, you never can say a word against f anybody, sister; you think all people are angels. But even if the Miss Ma- thers were saints, how would you like to live in a house filled, as theirs is, with mysterious noises, and where the chairs go moving about the rooms without anybody touching them? I'm not scary, but that would frighten me. 'Why, isn't Abbe herself longing to get away? I heard her tell you so; and no wonder, when her brother Harvey's ghost bothers them every night." "Oh, Dick! That is all nonsense!" "But I believe it, sister, I do. The Bible tells of witches and devils, and I guess these dritters ain't all done com- ing among us; and-----" "Stop, please stop!" said the young woman, who could not bear to hear him talking thus about the place where she was born, and where her earliest years had been spent. He at once obeyed and began whis- tling again, but he had scarcely com- menced, when the   ancient Harvey Mather gig, with Prudence, as usual, seated bolt-upright within it, and giving, at every five revolutions of the wheels, a jerk at the reins, was seen approach- ing from the direction of the mill. As the old maid's eyes fell upon this cheer- ful, sunny spot, she iknit her brows, then suddenly her expression changed, and she smiled. "Solomon will do as I wish," she muttered, " and the huzzy will not be long where she is, right in my path to the village, and .staring at me every time I go there."  She had now arrived opposite the gate, towards  which Dick was standing with- his face   turned, though his eyes were cast down 1h on the pages of a book he had just a began to read.           f (V What's that you've got there, eh?-  Tain't the Bible, I'm sure," she exclaim- t ed, stopping the horse. "No, Miss, (and being styled thus v made her wince) I keep that for Sab- bath," replied the lad, looking up. '"The vagabond!" she muttered, " he   has a free tongue, any way;" then raising- her voice--"But I'd like to know 'if you ever go to the house of worship?" "Regular, Miss. These three years 'back I've blowed the organ up in the choir, and I guess the psalm-singers could'nt get along without me. Now this was nothing more than the truth-the lad was very good, indeed, about attending divine service, in all kinds of weather, hot or cold, or the ground muddy or covered with a foot of snow. But there may seem nothing strange in this when we are told that the finest voice ever heard in the Epis copal church in Eastchester was black- eyed Lizzie's. '* Hadn't you better shade them eyes of yours, eh?" continued the tormentor, now turning her attention to Ellen. 4"Mr. Gregory has said that I ought," replied the young woman, who by this time had advanced as far as the gate. "He's right; then why don't you do it? Ah, what a blessing it has been for you to have him so long. Pity he should talk about leaving. Such a nice place, too, he has made here. But I guess stuffing birds don't pay; and he wants steadier employment." As she spoke she rivetted her gaze upon the miller's daughter ; but, keen as was her scrutiny, it failed to detect the slightest trace of emotion. This perfect calmness- was too much for Prudence. It irritated   her beyond measure; so, without again opening her lips, and with a fear- ful scowl, she continued on toward Eastchester, more than ever determined to entice Gregory away from the cabin. Scarcely had her vehicle gone of sight, when, to the inexpressible astonishment of Ellen and the lad, a large and elegant carriage, such as they had never seen before in their lives, drove up and stopped beneath a spreading oak tree, only a short distance from the gate. The coachman was dressed in livery, and beside him sat a boy, likewise in knee-breeches and with a velvet band around his hat. It was a costume which pleased Dick, for a moment, immensely, as he felt sure these people were the vanguard of a circus which was daily expected in the neighborhood. The door of the equipage was emblazoned with the figure of a lion, rampant, beneath which was a latin sentence. But more interesting, by far, than either servants or coat of arms were the two persons seated inside. One was an elderly gentleman, with pale, care-worn countenance; the other a young lady of perhaps sixteen or seventeen, with com- plexion extremly fair; so clear and white, indeed, that one might have readily concluded that no sunbeam had ever fallen upon it until this moment, when her veil was thrown aside. As soon as the lad beheld her face, which l was inclined slightly forward, as if to catch more of the delicious air, his book, , Ellen, Prudence-all, vanished fi om i his mind. We question even whether, i in this first burst of his admiration for L those long golden curls,. now blown s into confusion by the breeze, the , beloved Lizzie herself could have f :nade him turn away. s  He watched the stranger closely as I she descended from the carriage, and  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7736-00000023"/> noticed that her wrists were adorned with'magnificent bracelets, while the fingers of her right hand, which was ungloved, were sparkling with diamonds. Her mien, too, was altogether different from that of the village girls and farm- ers' daughters whom he was accustomed to meet. How grand!" he exclaimed, as with -the bearing of a queeen she ad- vanced towards the spot where he stood, accompanied by the gentleman, who ap- peared as if recovering from a spell of illness. "It is not often I find myself in the country," remarked Mr. Ambrose Everet, in an under tone to his daughter Harriet, "and there is nothing I like better than a chat with plain people." The young lady made no reply, but continued gazing rather haughtily upon v Ellen and Dick. In a moment, however, s the look of pride disappeared from her s countenance, and a sweet smile took its i place; for in spite of her silks, satins, and jewels, her heart was kind, and she r saw that the persons standing by the 1; gate were in humble circumstances. c Besides, if for no other reason than o to please her parent, she resolved to sf smother her aristocratic feelings; in- f( deed, her second glance at our friend b Dick had taken her not a little by sur- prize.               al "  For a clod," she said to herself, " he M certainly is very 'handsome, and actually he has a  book under his arm!" Now, we we do not wish, reader, to prejudice you against MAiss Everet, but we must con- H fess that the society in which she moved ha in New York had given her some very tit unrepublican ideas. Until now, she never had had an opportunity of meet- an ing and conversing with any persons El except such as moved in her own ex- clusive circle; and, consequently, when ge she beheld this lad in bare feet and sh patched jacket and trowsers, but still car   ed with an intellectual and independent lie bearing, there was a conflict with her as preconceived notions of the "outside s. barbarians," as those were called who nt did not associate with the " upper ten." n- For her the country meant Saratoga d and Newport, where ladies went merely 3, to show off their delicate figures, and i- dance and flirt until the " wee hours" 1, of the morning. Oh, Harriet, mill-lane and Nat Greg- f orv's cabin are certainly new scenes f for thee I e  When her father reached the gate, he r raised his hat to Ellen, who gracefully e bowed in, return; whilst Dick took off his dusty cap for an instant, then put it t on again and stood facing them, ,not i with boorish confusion, but with as much , self-possession as though he were con- scious of being just as good as any one  in the land. Though his eyes remained fastened rather too lofig, perhaps, on the young lady, she  seemingly took no offence, considering it a tribute paid to a degree of beauty and richness of attire which she felt certain he had never seen be- fore, and in all probability would never be in such proximity to, again. Ellen of course invited them to enter; and while the lad held the gate open, Mr. Everet glanced at the volume which he carried, and jocosely asked him if it was a work upon agriculture. "Why, father, it's Goldsmith's Natural History!" exclaimed his daughter, who had managed to catch a glimpse of the title. "Yes, sir, he thinks far more of wild animals than he does of farming," said Ellen. "Still, he is a very goodboy." "I don't doubt it," resumed  the gentleman, placing his hand on Dick's shoulder. When I was of his age I cared nothing about ploughing and   hoeing corn either, although (and he laid stress on the last words) I was born on a farm." Here Harriet was obliged to make another strong effort to conquer her pride, which was touched by this candid - confession of her humble origin; and she would have cast a   reproachful glance at her parent had she given way to her first impulse. Happily, however, she again triumphed over herself. ' Not enough money to be made at farming," said the lad. "-I want to possess a fine library one of these days," and to do so I must be rich." "AMoney!" repeated the gentleman, groaning, and pressing his hand to his forhead. "Is that what you are sighing for?" As he spoke, his daughter glanced anxiously at Dick, and whispered, "Don't talk about money; please don't." Dick evidently misunderstood her, for he immediately ran into the house and broughl t out a couple of chairs; and Ellen, likewise believing that Mr. Everet was sufferiin from some momentary faintness, asked the lad to hurry after some fresh water. The creaking seat which was offered him, was eagerly accepted by the stran- ger; and when in a few moments there was placed at his feet a well filled bucket with a large yellow gourd float- ing on the surface, he smiled, and ap- peared greatly pleased; and Harriet also rejoiced, for her father's nervous condition had of late caused her no little uneasiness; and anything that served to dispel  his morbid spirits ' 'gratified her beyond measure. "This carries me back many, many years," said Mr. Everet; "yes, it must be almost forty, since I tasted water out of a bucket. It has been all crystal   and silver, and sometimes even gold; but this is better than all the rest," at the same time'raising the gourd to his lips and sipping its contents with evi- dent gusto. When Dick heard such sentiments expressed by a person- whose coachman was in livery, and who rode in such a fine carriage, he appeared amazed, and we may pardon him if for a moment be believed Mr. Everet was somewhat de- mented. "Perhaps you would like to go and see the spring where I got this water from?" he remarked to. Harriet, whose large hazel eyes had\turned upon him. ("There is not a lovelier spot in all the woods." Ellen smiled, and well she might, for the idea of proposing such a thing as a walk through the brambles and over rocks and stumps to a delicately brought up city lady in flounces, and with thin- soled shoes, especially when ten minutes had scarcely elapsed since they had first met, could only have originated with such an innocent, artless lad as Dick;, who  thought, because Lizzie On .erdonk found the trees and brooks an( fields beautiful, therefore exerybody els would also. 'To her surprise, however, Miss Everet at once. accepted the invitation, her father adding that a little rough exercise would do her no harm. "Do not mind me," he said, waving his hand, "I feel already much better since I have been reposing here; yes, go by all means." So off they went; and as. he watched them disappearing anmong the bushes, "That lad is rich, very rich!" be 'mur- mured. "True, if an honest heart constitutes wealth," remarked  Ellen, .who  was stooping down by his side and gathering  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7736-00000024"/> a few violets and lilies of the valley, which she intended to make into a bouquet for his daughter. "There are times," he continued, in a rather mournful tone, "when I bitterly regret ever having left the old farm." Then lowering his voice, and address- ing Ellen, he said, "I will confide to you something about myself which is known only to myself and daughter. Although I am worth more than a million, I am haunted by the thought that I may become a beggar!"And again he placed his hand upon his brow and groaned. "It is the last thought to leave me at night, and the first which comes to me in the morning. Sometimes I feel tempted to--"But the sentence was left unfinished, and bowing down his head, he remained for a while silent. Let us now leave him and follow his daughter and Dick. The spring, towards which the lad was conducting his fair companion, was situated about two hunr dred paces from  the cabin, and the path that led to it was hardly-worth the name, for cat-briars had in many places stretched entirely across it, as well as the drooping branches of cedars and evergreens, and these he was obliged to cast aside, while Harriet passed by. s Every time he saw a nest he would stop, t and, if within his reach, would gently I pull the limb down and let the young lady take a peep at the eggs, or the I little birds. Once a garter-snake glided t swiftly across the narrow way; she g started, and seizing him by the arm, ask- t ed if he were not afraid to come here 1 without shoes and stockings; and when he informed her that these reptiles c were harmless, and that he often caught a them by the tail and brought them home alive, she smiled incredulously. b Of course he told her about Nat's a   collection of stuffed birds and animals, all of which she- begged him to show her on their return; and before they arrived at the spring, he had come to the conclusion that she was not only charming as far as looks were concerned, but that her tastes and his own were quite similar. As for Harriet, who was aufait in all the ways of the world, she had not taken long to discover that Dick was an admirel of nature, and had readilyjoined him in his praises of the forrest, and of the songsters, which at this moment were warbling so sweetly on every side of them. The fountain she really did admire, and acknowledged that it was well worth coming to see. It was on a slight de- clivity, and the water gushed out of a rock. On a patch of green moss close by, sat a huge frog, apparently very tame, and it was not until the lad's hand was almost upon it that it deigned to leap into the basin at the base of the spring. The branches of a shell-bark hickory allowed only a few straggling sunbeams to reach the water; and high up on the top of the tree, and clinging to a  very small branch, were two red squirrels, chattering at each other as though they were discussing some im- portant, question. "Pretty little creatures!" exclaimed Harriet, as she  watched them; " how happy they seem   to be, and what a glorious prospect they must have up there."  Wouldn't you like to be as happy as they?" "But they are quarreling, Miss ; see, one of them is already vanquished, and is running off," replied Dick. This was indeed the case. They had both darted down from their lofty perch and  were jumping  from  limb  to   limb, and from tree to tree, until they became lost from view amidst the um- brageous foliage. "I must not leave here," continued Harriet, "without tasting this water. Have you a cup?" ("No, but 'twill not take me long to niake one ;" and as he spoke he pluck- ed a few leaves from the hickory tree, and quickly forming them into a bowl, filled it and with a steady hand liftted it to her lips. "More delicious than anything I ever drink at home!" she exclaimed; at the same time looking at his black eyes and wishing that some of her city beaux had such sparkling orbs. "I am so glad you are pleased," said Dick, a slight blush rising to his cheek. "And there is a charm about the country which I did not believe it pos- sessed," she continued; "why, I could pass all my life here!" "But winter, Miss, changes the scene a great deal; these trees are then all bare; the squirrels hide away in hollow places to sleep through the cold weath- er; and the frog you saw just now, buries itself deep in ,the mud; and oh, how cold my feet get when I come here for a bucket of water! I never can see the robins and sparrows gathering in flocks on frosty Autumn mornings without wishing that I had wings that I might fly off with them to a warmer climate." "But that is the season for study, and no doubt you profit 'by it, for you are fond of reading." "I am, Miss, yet I hardly know what I should do for books, were it not for Lizzie Onderdonk." "She is the person whom I saw with you at the house?" "Oh, no; Lizzie is a great deal   younger, and lives on the other side of the village. Her father is quite well off, has a fine library, and she lends me as many volumes as I want. But one of these days, I hope, I shall have a collection of my own." "I hope you may. In the meantime, cannot you come to the city and see oin books? We .have I don't know how many; and yet they are only touched once in a while, when the servant goes to dust them; for they are mostly works on science and history, and you know that is considered very dry read- ing. Nothing takes now-a-days except novels. Are you fond of that kind of reading? For my part, I confess I am. ( Five Times Dead,' that I'm now read- ing, ' Do Forgive Her,' and Matrimo- nial Felicity,' -which I finished last week, are perfectly charming." And as she went on enumerating book after book of this description, Dick suddenly forgot himself and wan- dered off into dreamland. He fancied that he was already the possessor of an immense library; that his reputation for learning was world-wide ; and when, at length, Harriet came to the end of her long list of romances and asked which of them all he liked best, the' shock of returning again to stern reali- ty caused him to start, and he could not help sighing as he looked at his bare feet and ragged clothes, for they told, him how far off he still was from' the temple of fame. "It needs a small 'fortune to get a library," he said, scarcely heeding her question. "It really does," she answered. "Whil, it costs even more than one of:. these," holding up her right hand and".; ishowing him several diamond rings,j: !I and, taking from her delicately formed;1, l fingers one of the largest and mom : - "-., . S  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7736-00000025"/> brilliant of these gems, she said with a bewitching smile, "Allow me to make you a present of this, but tell nobody; and if you ever need money, why, sell it." For a moment he hesitated, and seemed to doubt whether she was in earnest; then holding out his right hand he received the jewel in his palm; and after examining' it, and wondering how such a small thing could be so valuable, let it quietly drop into his trousers' pocket, where the precious gift must have been horrified atfinding itself in the company of a fishing line and a rusty knife. It may seem strange, at first blush, that this stranger, this aristocratic young lady, accustomed as she had al- ways been to associating with none but Y the most pretentious, should divest her- self of one of the rarest and most cost- ly of her jewels to, present it to a  meanly clad rustic-but the fact is, that i such things had been lavished upon t] her in so great profusion that she did not o really appreciate their value. She had li more of them than she could consist- to ently wear upon her tiny fingers, and, a moreover, had a wealthy and indulgent tl father, and it was only to signify a de- tc sire for anything, to have it gratified he instanter. Thus it is in life. Bless- fo ings that are common, that seem to st come as a matter of course, are but re slightly estimated. The denizens of to New York, who have a plentiful supply m of pure Croton, can scarcely appreciate wj its value-but what would the weary, w palate-parched traveller in a sandy des- wl ert give for a few drops of this delight- he ful beverage to slake his burning  thirst? Dick and his fair charge now started bu on their way back to the cabin, where he Mr. Everet and Ellen were found seat- e)   a ed side by side; the former holding in :e his hand the bunch of flowers vhich the young woman had gathered for his "daughter, and evidently in better spirits than when they left him. Harriet was d not slow in noticing the change, and so n great was her delight that she gave ex- t pression to it by throwing her arms af. ; fectionately around his neck and im. printing a fervid kiss upon his venera. ble brow. "Oh, father, this is better than Sara- toga!" she exclaimed; "we had such a delightful walk in the woods. I really did not know what the country was be- fore.", "But you have not seen the stuffed birds and animals which are behind the house," remarked Mr. Everet; "and if you ask him," looking towards Dick, "he will show them to you." At once the lad stepped forward to perform this agreeable task; and hav- ing led her to the show-cart, he raised the lid and began giving her the names of the different objects contained in this little Museum, explaining their habits, telling her what sort of nests the sever- al varieties of birds built, what food they ate, etc. She listened attentively to his enthusiastic recital; and when he concluded by expressing his desire for a microscope, that he might ,etter study the insects of which he had al- ready gathered quite a num ber, she told him, in a whisper, to sell the dia- mond ring and procure one. "That I will never do, no never," he replied warmly, and this time it was Iarriet who blushed; and as he gazed upon her, he thought she was the most beau- tiful creature he had ever beheld. Liz- zie Onderdonk certainly was handsome, but then. her complexion was too dark; her nose slightly inclined upwards; her eyes were as restless and flashing as his   own; and there was something rather  too bold about that young gipsey. While  here were a pair of hazel eyes, cheeks the color of the roses when they first bloomed in spring, and wavy locks, which, as they curled down her white neck, seemed just made for the zephyrs to play with. And as he gazed, he felt tempted to fall upon his knees and tell her that he adored her. Happily, how- ever, he recovered his sense of propri- ety in time to check the impulse that swelled his heaving chest. For one more hour the strangers re- mained at the cabin, but it was rather a silent one so far as Dick was concern- ed, and Ellen had to do -most of the talking. Was he bashful? Not he. Was he tired of conversing? Not by any means. What then had wrought this sudden change in his manner? We shall not undertake to unravel the mystery. Suffice it to say, however, that when the young lady and her parent   were at last seated in their carriage, and on the point of leaving, and when Harriet, with uplifted hands, leaned to- wards him and bade him not forget to come and visit her father's library in the city, he clasped his hands together and endeavoured to speak, but he had entirely lost his self-possession. His heart throbbed violently, and he was unable even to give a parting adieu. When the sound of the wheels had died upon his ear, he returned to his wonted consciousness; but when he found himself alone with Ellen, at the humble cabin door, there came over him, for the first time in his life, a feel- ing of discontent. Surely, if ignorance is bliss, 'twere folly to be wise. Oh, Lizzie Onderdonk, couldst thou have been here at this moment, and read the emotions of your admirer's heart, thou wouldst have had reason to exclaim, "Woman is not the sole pos- sessor of fickleness."  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7736-00000026"/> CHAPTER VII.   CERTAINLY, the homes of .the wealthy citizens of New York, even as far back as I839, impressed one with the idea not only of solid comfort, but of luxury also. There was an abundance of coal, in the winter, to prevent Jack Frost from getting any farther than the key holes of the doors; and canvas-back ducks, ac- companied with old Madeira, made nearly every inhabitant of St John's Square a victim of the gout. In those days that was the most fash- ionable quarter uf Gotha rn, and many a dashing belle, many a perfumed ex- -quisite of the masculine gender, many a gouty crone dwelt in that once beau- tiful locality, now occupied by board- ing-houses, stores and shops. And yet will the world believe us when we say that the progenitors of many of these "first families" had raised turnips and cabbages, retailed thread and needles, ground knives and *scissors, and had often felt thankful to Heaven when they could retire to their straw mattresses at night, or perhaps even the bare floors, without suffering the naughings of hunger? But does not this prove how absurd it is for any class of individuals to arrogate to themselves the possession  {of aJl the gentility, and to claim homage fror those who move in an humbler sphere? For, verily, cabbage-raising  and tapering fingers can approach wonderfully close together, at least in 1 republican America. Spme sage has declared that the 1   a All Wise Ruler of events has favored 1 us thus as a reward for our steadfast adherence to republicanism. Be that f as it may, the mutability of wealth in this country has not failed of observa. , tion, not only by foreigners who have visited us, but by our own people. The secret of all this is, that we have no etl- tailed estates. The children of ealthy parents all fare alike-the first-born is not made " the lord of the manor," to the detriment of his brothers and sisters who come into the world at a subsequent period. And then, too, the road to wealth and preferment is, open to all. The beggar of to day may be a millionaire in a-few years; and the tailor who plies his needle to-day, may yet reach the Presidential chair-for what has been, may be again. There is no "roya roadtolearning." No patent is required to secure distinction in this much favored land. Engergy and in. domitable perseverance, combined with virtue, are the only capital required in order to reach the temple of fame. Foreigners may sneer, and say that our aristocracy will not stand the test of probing-but what of that? What if the family coat of arms is not to be found in the "book of heraldry "? It is not ancient lineage-it is not wealth that constitutes true aristocracy. This is made of sterner stuff, and virtue and intelligence are its corner stone. Of all the mansions in New York, there is none which equals Mr. Ambrose Everet's. It might almost seem to be too capacious, and it would indeed   require many children's merry voices to make its vast interior in any degree cheerful. The first thing which strikes you, as you enter, is the mosaic flooring of the hall, which does not bend nor -crack beneath the tread; indeed, were one to close his eyes while walking upon it, he might almost fancy himself upop the solid ground; and as the successful banker crosses it on his way towards the massive stair-case, or turns to the left and enters the spacious drawing room, there must be moments when his i eart beats exultingly, and he says to himselfl "This repays me for all my toil; I have not worn myself out4in Wall street bor nothing "  Wi e will now briefly speak of the antecedents of Mr. Everet. He was born in the State of Vermont, where his father and grandfather had passed their days, and were plodding, contented farmers; and his parents had hoped that he likewise would follow the plough. But from an early age young Ambrose had manifested a strong desire to lead a more stirring life, and consequently he had been sent to the public sohool as much as he could be spared, that he might acquire learning sufficient to en- able him to cope with the world. It happened that one of Mr. Everet's neighbors, Jeremiah Conklin, had also a boy of about the same age as his own, who was equally anxious to leave the family hearth-stone and launch his bark upon the surging ocean of business. And when the youngsters had attained their sixteenth year, their parents met, and after a calm survey of all the risks, each determined to give his son a twenty dollar bank note, and then allow him to "paddle his own canoe." Soon after which, with joyous countenances, the youthful fortune-seekers, Ambrose Ev- eret and Jeremiah Conklin, Jr., hurried   away from their native hills, in quest of employment in the busy world. As far as the town of New Haven they kept each other company; but there they separted, Ambrose being more than half convinced that his companion had grown homesick. In this, however, he was mistaken. Jeremiah had a motive in not going any farther, and later in our story he will again appear and give an account of himself. Young Everet pursued his way alone until he reached the city of New York, and there he lost no time in seeking employment. He borrowed a news- paper, read carefully the column of wants, and soon found an advertisement of a situation which he believed he might creditably fill. It was. that of office boy. Accordingly, he applied at No. - Wall-street, the place of busi- ness of one of the leading bankers; held his head up, was not ashamed to tell where be was born, nor afraid to sound his own praises. He seized a sheet of foolscap, wrote rapidly a few lines upon it, and in such a distinct and flowing hand, that he was accepted at once, and given a higher position than the one he had come to seek. From this lowly beginning, he had gradually worked his way up higher and higher, until, in time, he became chief bookeeper, then partner, and at last made love to and married one of the banker's daughters. And from this union it was that had sprung the maiden whom poor Dick had so much admired. Having thus rapidly sketched his previous career, let us now enter his abode,-where we will again meet Har- riet. Being an only child, and her mother having died when she was an infant, we need not wonder that this young lady is what is termed a spoiled child.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7736-00000027"/> Her father, of course, petted her, and so did everybody else, which was na- tural enough; for did not the shrewd Adamses, who came to her receptions and her parties; and who smiled so sweetly, and hung around her like bees about a flower, know that her father was a millionaire? And did they not note, with secret glee, his melancholy and haggard countenance, which they believed indi- cated softening of the brain, and a speedy demise? This was Harriet's first year in so- ciety; and at balls, when other young ladies were " walled," she would be in- undated with invitations to take the floor. She had, moreover, enjoyed all the benefits of a fashionable education. Her governess, who had   been im- ported expressly from Paris, was a most excellent woman in her way, and an ardent admirer of light literature; and I whenever not engaged in teaching "the j young idea how to shoot," she had pass- \ ed her time reclining on the sofa I reading "' La Nouvelle Heloise." i Harriet, thdrefore, wuas able to speak I French, perform on the piano, sing a s number of Italian airs from the operas; but what was better than all, she could v make a genuine French courtesy. Of c Milton and Shakespear, the history of r her own country and of England-or, t rather, la perfide Albion, as her gover. v ness expressed it,-of sewing and cook- d ing; or, in fact, anything that might M prove really useful to her, she knew u very little indeed. Public schools, n where rich and poor might mingle to- o gether and  become acquainted with c each other, she had always heard spoken t of by Mrs. Merryweather (of whom b more anon) in words of contempt, as a places where no genteel perons ought t ever to send their' children, being in- tI   d tended only for the "outside barbari. - ans "-a favorite expression with this d Semiramis of the "upper ten." s  Now, Mrs. Merryweather was a per. ) son who, to a greater degree even than s the French governess, had moulded r Harriet's mind, and imbued her with a fondness for liveried servants and coats t of arms. Once seen, she was never to I be forgotten. Her skin was white as - alabaster, for she bathed it daily with a cosmetic, the modus operandi of pre. paring which, she had never breathed even to her dearest friends. In her teens she had been slender and graceful; but as years bad sped away, she had become quite corpulent; and, in spite of all she could do to pre- vent it, there was an everlasting pimple on her chin. She dressed extravagant. ly. But why not, inasmuch as her hus- band was not only immensely rich, but bed-ridden with paralysis, and, there- fore, unable to discover how much silk and satin, and how many jewels she bought?? The entertainments, which she gave were truly magnificent; and her appearance in -the ball-room was, to say the least, striking. On these occasions her dress was worn very low in the neck; so low, in- deed, that the first time Miss Everet met her thus attired, she startled. And then, as an additional attraction, there was upon her powdered neck a   large diamond cross ; the scintillations from which, as- the jewel came  in contact with the rays of light emitted by the numerous gas jets, were rendered more observable by repeated heavings of the chest, which were no doubt intended to be regarded as deep-drawn sighs, but they really formed one of those arts which fashionable women practice to make themselves appear more at- tractive.   Mr. Merryweather was, as we have said, an invalid 'slowly wasting away, until now he had scarcely conscious- ness enough left to recognize even his wife, who from time to time attended at his bed-side, and where once or twice she had been seen to kneel by his bed- side, as if engaged in prayer; but there is too much reason to fear that, if she prayed at all, her supplications were not for his recovery, but for his speedy lelease from his bodily suffer- ings and his departure to the spirit- land. Mrs. Merryweather was well ac- quainted with the art of dissimulation. She 'affected to be very much depressed in spirits, and the truly charitable, doubtless, attributed her depression to the illness of her \husband. But we j may look for another cause of her un- rest. She had noticed, for a long time, that Mr. Everet was gloomy and sad; and possessed, as he was, of wealth and all the surroundings that could be de- sired to make one happy, she was puz- izled to divine the cause of his unhap- piness. "Could it be dyspepsia?" was the first question she asked herself; and during one whole week she had ransacked her husband's library in search of some work treating of this complaint. At last she had concluded that it must be something else. Was it softening of the brain? Another six days had been consumed in earnest endeavours to throw light on this point; and in the end she had satisfied herself that it was not. Then what could it be? Suddenly, one night, when she was about retiring to rest, the idea flashed upon her mind that he was in love! and then a little voice seemed to whisper in her ear: ' He is a widower, but you are not yet a widow." And as she pondered she sighed deeply, for she   knew that her husband might yet lin  ger many months. "Why does he not go to his eternal reward?" she said that night as she adjusted her night-cap; "he suffers so much." The next mbrning, when she awoke after a troubled slumber, the first thing she heam d was that same small voice; and often since it had troubled her, so that now Mr. Merriweathers's lingering on the shores of time had becomne almost unindurable. She was now firmly con- vinced that it was herself Mr. Everet was in love with. But, alas! in this world the horizon of our brightest hopes too often has at least one dark speck upon it; and this good lady's cloud was nothing less than her own unholy aspirations. James Merryweather, Jr., was a good- looking youth of twenty. In his love for society he resembled his mother. He was invited to every dinner party- never missed a ball-was a jolly fellow at the club-and, moreover,very popular with the ladies. He had a far kinder heart than his maternal parent-had always taken his father's part in family disputes, and since the old gentleman's paralytic stroke, he spent several hours every day at his bed-side. The best proof we can offer of his having com- mon sense (which, by the way, is a rarer gift than people imagine) is his not having been contaminated by his mother's example. Frequently, when in his teens, he had incurred her dis- pleasure by his bold criticisms on social matters. For instance, he was wont to make sport of pedigrees, and annoyed her excessively by asking who his grand' parents were. Now he really did not know this, nor did anybody else appa. rently, for the first time he put the ques- tion he received a box on the ear, and a  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7736-00000028"/> repetition of the question, at a subse- quent period, elicited the threat that, unless he desisted in propounding ," such foolish questions," he should be sent to sea and occupy a place in the fore- castle. He was an ardent admirer of female beauty, and when he was intro- duced to Harriet Everet, the past winter, he felt precisely as Dick did, when he saw her on mill lane. If any- thing, her charms were still even greater in the light of the ball room, which, while it showed rather too plainly the powder on Mrs.'Merryweather's neck, and the red spot upon her chin, could reveal on the young lady's person not a blemish other than an occasional azure vein which was observable through t the transparent cuticle; and if her t auburn locks on this occasion were not I ruffled  by the breeze, as when the ( country lad admired them so much, they a still played well their part, all braided and wreathed about her brow like, a s diadem, with many a gem glittering in 1 them.               a At first Mrs. Merryweather had fa- r vored his penchant for the rich banker's h daughter, but ever since the night when c she heard that small voice whispering in her ear and reminding her that Mr. c Everet was a  melancholy widower, she d had suddenly changed her tone, and a James could scarcely mention Harriet's b name without causing a frown on her brow. For were he to succeed in win- s] ning this young lady's hand, adieu to all her own chances of being wooed by g Harriet's father after Mr. Merryweather's ai departure for paradise.      H Let us now, indulgent reader, come si back to the Everet mansion, in St. w John's Square.           ba -  As we enter the drawing room, we behold a  stout lady, whose robe covers pl almost the entire sofa upon which she te   - is seated, and neat her sits Miss Everet t, Of course, the former is at once reco0g h nized, after the description we have t given, as Mrs. Merryweather. Both the ladies are in earnest con. f versation on some point about which - thev evidently do not agree. t  "But he's a poor hump-back fellow," said Harriet, playfully tossing up and down a silver piece " and can't find any employment ; so I am sure there is no harm in giving him this. Why, it's not a quarter as much as father puts in the church plate every Sabbath." "But remember, my dear, that these kind of people are never satisfied, and I make it a matter of principle never to throw anything away upon them-even those brats who sweep the crossings in muddy weather are not deserving objects of charity, for they go home and give all they earn to drunken parents." Just as she had finished speaking a servant came in and told Harriet that a beggar boy was at the basement door asking for her. So, excusing herself a moment, she hurried down stairs, and having given the silver dollar to a sickly cripple, returned again to the parlor. The subject of conversation was now changed, and the young ladycommenced descanting upon a pleasant drive she and her father had taken a few days before into Westchester county. "Oh!"I enjoyed myself so much!" she exclaimed. "  And doubtless your father was also gratified," remarked the other; "country air is good for depression of spirits. Have you noticed any change in him since?" and as she spoke her eyes were fixed closely upon those of the banker's daughter. "  Decidely better; and he liked the place we visited so much that he is de- termined to go there again soon." To   "Humph I perhaps you met some p pleasant people?"          g "Well, we really did." And then J Harriet went on to describe Nat's cabin, 1 Ellen and Dick ; and when she inform- o ed Mrs. Merryweather that the young woman was disfigured by small pox, e and losing her sight, would you believe b it, reader, this proud lady actually felt r relieved; for, in her preqent morbidly i anxious state, the least thing served to x arouse her suspicions. "Dear child," she soliloquized, gaz-  ing on the fair creature at her side, at c the same time solemnly shaking her head, " you little dream what it is that causes your parent's unhappiness, and E how nearly it is connected with myself." Then placing her right hand on her bosom, "Ilave you ever imagined," she asked, " what his complaint is?" Now Harriet knew'only too well the sad truth, and many an anxious moment had it caused her, but of course she was not disposed to reveal it to others; for would they not believe the millionaire was deranged to be so constantly harrassed by the fear of poverty? So, after a little hesitation, and with some- thing like a twinkle in her eye (for really Mrs. Merryweather's questions excited her mirthfulness) she replied that she thought it was an affection of the heart. "Do you think so? Tell me, have you ever heard that from his own lips?" exclaimed Mrs. Merryweather with pro- found emotion. But Harriet remained foraseveral moments without again opening her lips; and during this interval her visi- tor leaned back on the sofa,+ and with her eyes raised to the ceiling, seemed to be engaged in supplicating the mercy seat. If this really was the case, no mortal, of course, knows the sum of her   petitions; but it does not require a very great stretch of the imagination to con- Iecture that it was in relation to her husband's lingering so long on the brinlc of the grave. Suddenly, however, she was so shock- ed by an expression which Harriet, who had been telling about her last party, made use of, that she ceased her sup- plications and turned her eyes fiercely upon her. "You astound me, my dear!" she exclaimed. "Why, what is the world. coming tc? You talking of vanity and the superfluity of dress, wishing us to lay aside our diamonds and our silks and satins!" "Yes," responded Harriet, with a good deal of warmth," we are too fond of show, and might wear far less ex- pensive things, and still be ladies. And if we did dress plainer, others might enjoy society who now are obliged to remain at home, merely because, if they came to our parties and receptions, their plainness of attire would cause them to be stared at and even ridiculed. "Stop, please stop!" cried Mrs. Merryweather, " or you will drive me distracted. Where in the world did you get such ideas? Not long ago you thought very differently." "Alas, I did; but I have changed. These fine houses we live in; all this expensive furniture; our carriages and , our liveried servants, what good are they to us unless they bring happiness? Oh I I believe money is often a curse!" I Here she was interrupted by a slight r shriek. "It is well that your excellent father i is not here to listen to you, Miss Ever- i et!" exclaimed Mrs. Merryweather. y "He, who has spent his best days o in Wall street, in amassing a colossal r fortune, to have a child of his calling  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7736-00000029"/> wealth a curse I Oh! what would he say?" "He would tell you that I was right. Yes, indeed he would!" How much longer this conversation might have lasted it is impossible to say, had not Harriet, in attempting to change the topic, mentioned the name of James Merryweather, jr., saying that he was to call in an hour to take her out for a drive. This announcement, as we may sup- pose, was gall and wormwood to the young gentleman's mother. There was a biting of the lip, a sinking sensation at the heart; and, rising from the sofa, she bade Harriet a somewhat formal adieu, then abruptly departed, mutter- ing as she went down the steps some- thing about James being a perverse boy; and even the footman, as he stood holding open the carriage door, could not help thinking his mistress had heard some bad news. Not many minutes after she had left, the banker returned from down town. It was before his accustomed time, but as soon as his daughter greeted him, she saw what had brought him home at this hour. He was seized with another paroxysm of ill-foreboding, and when ever he felt himself thus oppressed, he  instinctively flew to his daughter's arms, 1 as though he believed she could expel c his tormentor from his mind. "Oh, father! that wretched office is a -killing you; why do you continue going 1 there?" she said, as the tears started f to her eyes. . He made no reply, but l gently pressed his lips to her cheek. c i" lid rather live in such a home as that," t she continued, pointing towards a small I   : but admirably executed painting which hung over the piano. It represented  an old farm-house with a broad meadow behind it, through which ran a brook, k and on the water's edge, with trousers rolled up, a boy stood -fishing. "Yes, let us go live in such a place as that. Green fields and fresh air will make you smile again. Perhaps, if we lived like poor people, you would no longer be disturbed with the fear of dying a beggar." While she was speaking, her father gazed on her with unfeigned astonish- ment. Could some angel have whis- pered these words in her ear? Or, had they sprung from her own affectionate heart? Many a time, of late, he had sighed to be again in the country, yet had not dared to propose it; not that he believed she might rebel against such a move, for she was too good and dutiful a daughter for that; but he felt it would be cruel to tear-her away from her balls and her hosts of fashionable friends. "Yes, yes " urged Harriet, as she perceived his countenance brightening. "We can have a pretty cottage near that village which we went to the other day. You will then be able to befriend the poor young woman who is growing blind; and your large income can make everybody happy around you. And, moreover, your library---." She was about to add that the books which their library contained, would prove so use- ful to Dick, when she checked herself; perhaps she feared that he might dis- cover how much her heart had been touched by the lad's sparkling eyes and handsome face.   CHAPTER VIII.   A FEW evenings after Prudence Ma- d ther's visit to Mr. Onderdonk, a Lizzie found herself seated behind the tc stone house at the creek, in company c with the old maids, one on either side c of her. It was not necessary to take a second t glance at the girl's countenance to per- c ceive that she was already beginning to \ suffer from the loneliness of the place. I Abbe, who sat the nearest to her, was s holding a ponderous bible, out of which she was reading aloud, casting, how- a ever, every now and then, a timid glance 1 towards her sister; who, although ex- i ceedingly scrupulous in attending di-  vine service, in reality entertained the profoundest contempt for " folks what had religion." Poor Abigail, whenever she felt happier than usual, would take to her bible, and certainly since Lizzies arrival, although Prudence frowned as much as before, she had enjoyed more happiness than for a number of years past. It was just such a bright, merry spirit -as her young friend possessed, that was needed to dispel the gloom which so long had hung over the building; and although the girl was rather moody at present, Abbe attributed it to her sis- ter's harsh manner, which she fondly hoped would soon be laid aside. There is no doubt that if the elder one had chosen to turn less frequently her cat eyes upon Lizzie, she might have been disposed to sing a few of the sweet songs which had always pleased Dick so much. But not only did Pru-   dence stare fiercely at her, but she had actually made an attempt to stuff cot- ton into her ears (for the crazy man's closet not being quite prepared to re- ceive him, she feared that his singing might be heard), which attempt the girl had indignantly resisted; and this, of course, had brought on a struggle that. had only served to irritate them both, but more especially the old maid, for she had been worsted. "Is that the way you're going to sit," asked the querulous spinster, "from breakfast to supper, as dumb as if you had no tongue in your head? Ha! if you fancy I'll get tired of having you here on that account, you'll find your- self mistaken. The longer you choose not to laugh and sing, the longer I'll keep you; and what's more, if I make a bad report to your father, he'll---Ha, hal I know what he'll do." At these words Lizzie grew pale, for she was aware of the great influence Prudence exercised over Mr. Onder- donk, who would certainly do whatever ;she might suggest. ) "I've known birds," continued the Iold maid, with a malignant smile, "that t were kept in a cage a whole yearlwith- - out singing, a note; but they became r tamed at last, and were all the better songsters. And so 'twill be with you." r  "Do as sister says," whispered Abi- y gail, who felt distressed at the turn af- t fairs were taking. Prudence was evi- e dently inclined to be too severe, and if d the former had dared, she would open- l- ly have taken the girl's part; but in all  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7736-00000030"/> things the latter ruled, and so the bgst course for her to adopt was to persuade Lizzie to yield. Unfortunately, Miss Onderdonk, who could be very pleasant when she chose, could also be very obstinate; and in her present humor she would have suffered any torture rather than have complied with the wish of the elder Miss Mather. "t She shall sleep to-night in the spare bed-room," resumed Prudence; "that'll bring her to her senses, and to-morrow she'll be the dearest creature imagina- ble. Ha, ha!" Lizzie still remained silent, and trem- bled when she heard what her punish- ment was to be, for she felt sure this apartment was the one where Abigail had told Ellen Fowler such mysterious things took place. An hour now passed by, and scarcely another word was uttered. The 3oung- t er of the old maids spent the time N reading to herself several chapters in ' the holy book, while the elder kept up a constant chuckle, occasionally draw- 1 ing her sleeve across her nose.  t At last the sun sank beneath the c horizon, and then it rapidly grew dark, p for the house was surrounded by woods on every side except the east, and there was very little opportunity for a ray of s the lingering twilight to penetrate the ti house. Lizzie now began thinking what, -course she would adopt in order to ob- w tain her liberty, in case Mr. Onderdonk al decided upon making this dwelling her m prison. If she ran away, where could " she go?  How could she support her- ca self? Dick, she felt certain, would ch readily assist her in any possible way; 0F but what could a poor lad like him ac- wi complish? And were she to go and th seek refuge in Gregory's cabin, did it   st not stand upon ground belonginfg to her le harsh parent, who could order the young man to leave at a very short notice? o From a few words which had passed e, between the sisters this evening, she n understood that Nat, who had left off e working in the garden at a rather early e hour, was expected back again before r night, to talk over important matters connected with the farm and the mill; eand she hoped that Dick would accom- 1 pany him; in which case the lad and r she might hold counsel together, and - perhaps devise some plan whereby her escape might be safely effected. At last, after sitting still until the clock struck eight, she fancied that she heard footsteps in the lane and Pru- dence, who was, as usual, on the alert, at once ordered Abigail to bring out another chair. "Punctual to the minute!" exclaimed the elder sister, addressing Gregory, who presently made his appearance; "and that's a virtue in my eyes." "So it is in mine, ma'm; never was late yet. Kind of darkish, eh? But tip-top night for sowing peas; lots of dew; and that always gives me an ap- petite." "Well, we shall have tea soon." "Supper, ma'm, do call it supper," said Nat; "that sounds more substan- tial." "Well, then, supper," Abbe at this moment approached with a three legged stool in her hand, and immediately her sister placed her mouth close to her ear and whispered, "Put some of that 'ere cold pork and cabbage on the table, and a piece of cheese." The young man seized this opportunity to speak a word to Lizzie, who had gently glided up' to him and thrust one of her arms through his. "Dear, go help sister set the table,"   resumed Prudence, stretching out her te hanld and tapping her significantly on pt the shoulder; while the tone in which th she spoke was so soft and sweet that ec Abbe scarcely recognized it.  The girl felt strongly tempted to dis- b obey (for she knew this request was in n reality meant as a command), and pro- t1 bably would have done so had not the tt other old maid, who dreaded the result n of a conflict while Mr. Gregory was v present, taken one of her hands in hers s and drawn her away.        z Just as the door closed behind them ' (and the elder sister was careful to see I that it was well closed), a whistle was ( heard near the house, and at once Pru- s dence gave one of her wicked grimaces, and her nose itched violently, for she 1 readily. enough guessed that it was Dick hovering about, and endeavoring 1 to obtain an interview with Lizzie. It was fortunate that they were in the: dark, and that Gregory could not see i her countenance, for he was full as shrewd as herself, and might, had he been' able to read her thoughts, have given her a lecture which would have probably ended in high words; for al- though he rarely got angry, he still had a temper which was none the less vio- lent for being very difficult to arouse. No sooner did Lizzie find herself alone with the younger sister, than she began in a plaintive voice to sing a beautiful song, which seemed ten times more melodious to one whose ears had not for many a day heard anything of the kind within these walls. The poor maniac, up stairs, it is true, was wont to sing to Abbe whenever she went to his prison, with his meals, but his ab- surd attempts to woo the gentle muse only excited her pity. But for the unfortunate disposition of the elder of these two maiden sis-  .,   ters, Lizzie Onderdonk would have proved, even in, this gloomy abode- this " haunted house," as it was regard- ed, '" a well-spring of pleasure ;" for, in Abbe's estimation, the lamp seemed to burn brighter, and the tea-kettle to hum more cheerfully since she had crossed the threshold. The younger sister, therefore, was distressed at the unkind manner in which the youthful guest was treated by her senior, and she re- solved that, if she could prevent it, Liz- zie should not pass the night in the "haunted chamber."  "No, it would be cruel," she said to herself. "Mr. Gregory must be prevailed upon to stay, and he can sleep there." While Abbe and Lizzie were busying themselves setting the table, Nat and Prudence were conversing outside, in under-tones. "Well," he remarked, "it certainly is an extremely liberal offer, and .no doubt if I were the only person that had a say in the matter, the bargain might be concluded right here, and be- fore we go to supper. But, Miss Ma-  ther, caring for oneself may be over- - done, just like anything else in this I world; and if I were to accept your - .proposal, and leave the lad and Ellen to earn their own bread, my material f prosperity would no doubt be increas- e ed; but, my heart-how would it feel?" i  "Your heart! ]Bah! smother such a s thought as that, sir. Why, I gave you d credit for being one of the wise men of ff this earth. Take my word, Mr. Gre- r gory, the main point in life is to care it for nobody, unless the- person you bene- to fit can give you a push ahead in return. )- Besides, is it just to Dick to let him ;e grow up as wild as a deer, instead of sending him off to learn a trade? )n When he gets older will he not say s- that you were a bad guardian? And  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7736-00000031"/> your reputation, too, is suffering from the way you act. If you need a woman to cook, and mend your clothes, why don't you get a wife? Although I don't believe that Miss Fowler is what some folks in the village say (for I knew her father in old times, and there wasn't a better man than he in the township, and for the sake of his name I always take his daughter's part), nevertheless, sir, your reputation is suffering on her account. Now don't take offence, sir, please don't!" She had been startled by Nat's springing up from his seat, and feared that she had presumed too much upon his good nature. "By all that's sacred, Miss Mather, you shall take back every word you've uttered! or I'll have you sued for slan- der! I'm not the kind of chap to sit  still and hear a person I think so much t of as Ellen Fowler, talked of in that ; style. Take it back I or else " "O mercy, Mr. Gregory! I meant e no harm," cried the woman, earnestly. p "On my word, I didn't; I only told i you I'd heard others saying bad things  of her; but I never believed them." L "And who are those infamous, lying t gossips, that have nothing better to do q than invent stories? Come, I want  their names 1" "Calm yourself, sir, do l" answered st Prudence; who, for the first time in hi years, discovered that she had found m her match.             a "I'll tell you by and by; upon my se honor I will; at present you are too w much excited."          fi "And well I may be! but my excite- m ment soon passes over, and now I'm as ag cool as a cucumber again. But mark Bu my words, the names of those tradu- cers I must have, sooner or later! As an for your offer of a situation here, I the   m won't even think of it any more. If L" folks are trying to tread on Ellen be- iy cause she's poor and getting blind, you l t can tell 'em there's a fellow called Nat le Gregory who will never desert her." er  "But public opinion is sometimes a very powerful," resumed the old maid P, in a subdued tone. 's  "Bah! what is public opinion? Isn't s, it an article often manufactured by two r or three men and women, with smarter r, tongues than their neighbors, who get together in a corner and lay their plans, S and then come out with such brazen 1 faces, that the world believes them? I n tell you it can't make me budge one inch; no, ma'm!" and as Nat spoke he , snapped his fingers closely to the old : maid's nose. "To change the subject, sir, may I ask whether you think of moving away this season, or remaining where you are?" "Humph! I like the place well enough, ma'm; I built the house, re- paired the fence, and have everything in apple-pie order; but old Onderdonk has become cranky about something of late, and yesterday he told me I'd have to leave. But as I've paid for this quarter, I needn't go right away; and I'll have time to look about for another home. Anyhow, as long as I've got strong arms, and plenty here," tapping his forehead, "there is no danger of my not prospering; aye, and of being able to support two others beside my- self. I like to have things go lough with me once in a while, for I feel so fine when I've kicked the stones out of my path and Ode the way smooth again. I'm bound to die-in harness! But I say, ma'm, aint supper ready?" "WTell, it ought to be; let us go in and see," replied Prudence, opening the door.   The table was found all prepared, I and Abbe standing by the tea-urn,  while Lizzie was just going out to give them a call. And as the young man entered, he smacked his lips in antici- p ation of a charming repast. Great, therefore, was his disappointment when he beheld only cold pork and cabbage and a piece of wormy cheese. But he made no remarks; and taking his seat, began rapidly devouring some slices of fresh bread which were placed in front of him; every now and then cutting off a piece of the cheese. Very few words were spoken at the table. The elder of the sisters was still chafing under the recollection of the young man's haughty conduct towards her, and looked so cross that Lizzie dared not speak; and they were almost through before Abigail ventured to break the silence. "You must, of course, pass the night here, sir," she said, addressing Nat as she handed him his third cup of tea. ("We can't think of letting you deprive us of your company so soon." "Many thanks, ma'm; it's only a short walk to my own roost," answered the taxidermist, and he was just on the point of giving a decided refusal when his eye met Lizzie Onderdonk's, and at once he changed his mind, for he saw that she wanted him to remain. So, after finishing his supper,'and heav- ing a deep sigh, he said': "But I guess I will stay." Supper over, he thrust his hands in- to his trousers' pockets and commenced pacing up apd down the room, gazing thoughtfully upon the floor, but every now and then glancing towards the girl, who was now assisting Abigail in wash ing the cups and saucers. "She's mighty pretty," he soliloquiz- ed, "and I don't wonder Richard be-   lieves there's nobody in the world like her. I guess Solomon Onderdonk finds her too noisy, and is tired of hav- ing her with him." By and by the clock struck ten, and Prudence walked across the room to where her sister was sitting beside Liz- zie, and whispered that it was time to take her young friend up stairs, adding with her 'mouth still closer to her ear, that she must sleep in the apartment where stood the bureau containing Har- vey's old papers. "We've got to break her stubborn spirit, Abbe, afore she'll sing and make the house what you want it to be. And nothing will bring her to obedience so quick as that room." While she was speaking, the girl watched her countenance closely, and felt sure that her name had been men- tioned; and she was almost tempted to throw herself at Gregory's feet, and beg him to intercede for her, when her fears were relieved by a kind look from Abbe, who took her by the hand and led her towards the door, hardly giving her a Chance to bid Nat good-night. "You shall have a mattress on the floor near me," said the kind-hearted woman as they mounted the stair-case, "and Mr. Gregory shall be put in the chamber where you were to have been. I don't intend to render your visit un- pleasant if I can help it, no matter how ,much sister may scold." Soon after they had left, Nat yawned, and Prudence taking the hint, lighted I another lamp, and was on the point of conducting him to his room, when, for- tunately, her sister came back and re- , lieved her of this duty. Had Abigail arrived one minute later it would have been a bad thing for Lizzie, as the - cross old maid would have discovered - where she was to sleep.  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7736-00000032"/> "If you wish to strike a light during the night," remarked Abbe, after they had entered the mysterious chamber, "here are some matches." "Oh, I guess I'll snooze straight through till your rooster crows to-mor- row morning. What should I want with a light?" said Gregory, holding his hand out to receive them. "V"Well, I hope you will rest undis- turbed and have pleasant dreams. May the Lord preserve you!" concluded the woman, shuddering, and then turning away. "Humph!" he soliloquized after she had disappeared; "there was some- thing she didn't like to tell me. I know the story is that there are queer things occuring in this house. But, bah! I don't believe any such nonsense." While he was undressing himself, he smiled and really wished that some hob-goblin might visit him, for-he felt certain that it could not frighten him. Presently he blew out the lamp and jumped into bed.  But hardly did he find himself in the dark, than a change came  over him which was unaccount- able; and he fancied that he heard the old maid's last words: "May the- Lord preserve you!" still ringing in his ears. 1 As for Abbe, after shutting the door, i she offered up a fervent prayer in his 1 behalf; and as she walked to her own r apartment on tip-toe, she could not a help thinking it was sinful to put any e human being in such a   place for a r night. Lizzie was found wide awake, and r bending down she gave her a kiss, and t discovered to her surprise that the ii girl's cheek was wet with tears. u "I  thought I heard somebody crying a a moment ago, Miss Abigail; who 'could h it have been? Oh! it sounded so very o doleful "             .h   g  The old maid assured her that it was y all imagination, and tried to laugh leer , out of her fears. But presently the crazy man's voice faintly reached her; t and Lizzie, rising in bed, exclaimed: -"* there it'is again!" "Imagination!" repeated the wmnar, , endeavoring to calm her: "You see I'm going to be close by, so rest easy. Believe me, it's nothing at all;" But as she spoke, she herself could not prevent a groan from escaping her. "Oh! it was wicked to do what \le did!" she murmured. "I thought so from the beginning; but I was then, and have been ever since, afriaid to speak out boldly against the crime; and now, alas, it may be too late. He may die on our hands." For a few moments she sat on the edge of the bed, listening with a beat- ing heart, for the cry of the prisoner, but it was not repeated; and finally, after once more endeavoring to ap- pease Lizzie's agitation, she retired to her own couch. All was now quite still; and' Nat, as. he lay buried in the depths of a large feather bed, like a log sunk between two waves, certainly felt, as far as l:s body was concerned, extremely com- fortable. But, for the first time in his life, he experienced something like nervousness; and had he known that a ghastly corpse had once been stretch- ed out here, he would have felt even more uneasy. "And is this the abode where spirits rap on the walls, and where the furni- ture dances gigs?" he thought, half insensibly, drawing his head paitly under the sheet; and despite his bold asseverations, the reflection disturbed his mind and precluded the possibility of sleep for an hour or more. Exactly how long his eyes remained closed, he   did not know, but when he again open- ed them, it was with a start, and he felt more agitated than before. Was it that he had eaten too much cold pork and cabbage? No, for his stomach did not trouble him in the least; therefore it must be something else; but what was it? -He thought first of one thing, then of another; and having at length be- come excited, he determined to rise and strike a light; "for," said he, "who knows but Prudence Mather has been sneaking around my bed, and is at this mcment in the room? She's up to all sorts of tricks, and wouldn't hesitate to do anything mean, since I've refused her offer of a situation here." He accordingly sprang out of bed, sat a moment peering into the darkness, and listening attentively, but could hear not a sound. He was just on the point of walking forward when,he found him- self stopped by some obstacle in the way, and stretching forth his hand, he found, to his astonishment, that it was the bureau, which, when he had first entered the room, was standing a short distance from the foot of the bed. For an instant he remained, as it were, petrified; his heart sank within him; but soon recovering his self-pos- session, he smiled, muttering to himself, "' Iit's her work, the varmint! Ha! she shan't bamboozle Nat Gregory!"Then slipping round the bureau, he groped his way toward the mantle piece, where he had left the matches. Having light- ed the lamp, he walked carefully around his dormitory, looking up the chimney and under all the furniture; but his search was fruitless. He perceived, however, that the door had been left unlocked, and he ac- knowledged that such a piece of care lessness on his part was hardly excus- able. "Yes," he soliloquized, turning   the key, "that she-devil has gone out just as slyly as she came in; but it won't happen a second time." Then having placed the bureau back where it was at first, he went to the window, and throwing up the sash, for a moment enjoyed the fresh air which came in from Hutchison's creek. When he returned to bed;, it is not surprising that he felt less sleepy than ever. He began to watch the stars, and wondered whether they might not be worlds like our own, and if so, were they inhabited? "And who knows," he thought, "but spirits, after leaving their tenement of clay, go there; and if they do, why should they not occasionally come ,back to this planet, and re-visit their old haunts?" ;"    O0 Strange ideas will pass through our minds in the night-time; and Gregory, as he turned restlessly from side to side, certainly had his full share of them. "I ain't scary about anything that I can see in broad day-light, and that's flesh and blood; but when a chap has quit this life, I don't want anything more to do with him. "Ugh!" he ut- tered, shuddering and pulling the sheet higher up. He now made a strong effort to get to sleep. He closed his eyes and en- deavored to stop thinking; but in spite of all he could do, the stories which Dick used to tell about Harvey Mather, came rushing upon him like an ava- lanche. The suicide's room, perhaps this was I And, at this horrid idea, he buried his head still further. Then it occurred to him that he was making a great fool of himself; and sitting up, he gave a yawn, at the same time stretching out his arms.  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7736-00000033"/> "By thunder! what's that?" he cried, -almost loud enough to arouse Prudence. "As I live I it's the bureau back by my bed again 1" His courage now abandonqd him al- together ; and curling himself up into a heap, he lay for about ten minutes in a cold sweat; his teeth chattering, and his knees'smiting each other at a vio- lent rate. Oh! what would he not give to be once more in his own "roost," with Dick and Ellen? Presently, the clock struck twelve, and the thought that he would probably have to remain here for three or four hours longer, was perfectly appalling. And, as he was thus musing, he heard a faint clipping sound, just as though a person were using a pair of scissors, in the farther end of the chamber. "Bless me!" he gasped, "if some one ain't cutting my pants and- coat!" Gradually the noise approached near- er and nearer, until, at length, the scis- sors, or whatever they were, seemed to be opening and shutting right above his head; and after an interval of about a minute, a cold sensation in the region of the crown, warned him that a hole had been made through the covering, and that the spirit-hand was at work upon his hair Poor Nat! Now it was that he prayed as he never had prayed before. 6"I'll be a pious Christian hereafter 1" he sighed, " if the Lord will only spare me to get away from this awful house." Finally, a kind of stupor seized him, and when he recovered his conscious- ness, the first thing he heard was Ab- be's Shanghai-rooster, crowing lustily; and turning his eyes towards the win- dow, he beheld the rosy dawn. What his feelings were at this sight, it would be impossible for pen to describe. He was like a person whose slumber has   been one 'prolonged night-mare, and who wakes to find himself still alive, and that his miseries have been only visions. And there, just where it was when he first entered the apartment, was the mysterious piece of furniture; and he might have come to the conclusion that, after all, he had only had a horrid dream, caused by excess in eating, had he not gazed into- a small mirror which hung on the wall beside him, and there discovered the whole truth too plainly revealed. "Is that really Nat Gregory!" he exclaimed,! staring, and looking as if at a loss whether to laugh or to cry. "If I could believe it was Prudence's doing," her continued, clenching his fists, "I'd have her up for 'sault and battery. One sister invites me to sup- per; 'tother one begs me to pass the night; and the end of it all is, my pate gets shaved till it's as bare as the day I was hatched 1" His first impulse, after realizing his sad plight, was quietly to escape into the lane, and get home without afford- ing either of the old maids the satisfac- tion of seeing him thus shorn; so, put- ting on his clothes (which happily had not been injured in the least), he slip- ped down stairs, and was making straight for the door, with his cap drawn over-his eyes and ears, when, to his dismay, who should come forth from the kitchen, broom in hand, but Pru- dence?          ,  "You're just like me, Mr. Gregory, an early riser," she exclaimed, striving hard to supress a smile; for a single glance of her keen eye told her some- thing had happened-" and them's al- ways the ones what catches the worms." "Humph!" growled the taxidermist, (" she's got impudence enough for six 1"   Then, halting a moment before cross- ing the threshold-"If you did it," he said, " let me tell you it was a darn'd mean -trick, and squire Miller shall hear about it before the sun's an hour high." "Did what?' cried the woman. "Look here!" he replied, 'uncover- ing his head and bowing so as to give her a full view of his bare crown, "On my word of sacred honor, sir, I wasn't nigh your room last night since I passed it to go to my own! may I be struck dead this minute if that ain't true! Oh! sir, please don't accuse me rashy and cause trouble. Promise not to say anything about it. I never meant you to occupy that apartment, anyhow." "Perhaps you wanted Miss Onder- donk to sleep there, eh?" "No, I didn't, but sister did," replied - the spinster, uttering this falsehood with as smooth a face as she ever wore when seated in church. "Well, Miss Mather, I am willing to keep mum about this affair, whether it was your work or the spirits'; but only =,n two conditions; first, that you never put Lizzie Onderdonk in there for a single night; and, secondly, that you give me the names of those who have defamed Ellen Fowler. What say you?" "I swear, sir, that Lizzie-whom I love and would not make unhappy for all the world-shall, while she stays here, have a bed near my sister. But, as for telling you who the wicked gos-   sips are in Eastchester, why really .[ couldn't single them out; for when I heard the stories I spoke to you of last evening, I was in a crowd of folks ; and as H live, I couldn't point out the slan- derers. No, indeed, I couldn't! But one thing I do solemnly declare, and that is, that I shall find out exactly whio they are, and use all my influence in the village to make 'em hold their tongues; and if they don't, I shall report them to you. Now, Mr. Gregory, I'm speak- ing frankly in this matter, and you can rely on me as a friend." Her voice was so gentle, her expres- sions so very sincere, that he could not help putting faith in her words, and he was on the point of walking off, pler- fectly satisfied, when she held her hand out to him. t"I know that I appear sour and ill- natured sometimes," she continued, '"but that's caused by dyspepsy, anid I'm kinder-hearted than some people think." Our friend nodded a quasi assent; then, having told her again that if she would keep her promise, he would be faithful to his, he departed. But, although the pleasure lie expe- rienced at being once more in the open air, was great, and he tried his best to walk briskly, he found, to his surprise, that he could hardly drag one foot after the other; and to judge from his hag- gard countenance, one might suppose that he was just recovering from an at- tack of the ague.  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7736-00000034"/> CHAPTER IX.   I HAD you searched through the whole township of Eastchester, it would not have been possible to find a better natured fellow than Nat Gregory. Dur- ing the six years Ellen Fowler had known him, she had never seen a scowl on his face. But the morning when she beheld him -coming towards her from the direction of the mill, she could but notice that his usually placid counte- I; ince was considerably disturbed. Not only was his cap drawn down over his eyes, but his lips were firmly pressed together; his left hand thrust far into his trowsers' pocket, while the right was tightly clenched, and moving back and forth as if striking at some imaginary foe. "Pray, dear Nat, what has happened?' she inquired, almost afraid to address him. as she pushed open the little gate and strode along the sanded path. "I guess Prudence Mather has got wind of her' cat!" thought Dick, who was perched upontihe stone wall reading and an empty bucket lying at his feet, which he had twice been asked to fill. C"And if she has, it will come hard on him, for I know he'll take all the blame to save me." "Oh, nothing's the matter," replied the young man, looking up at Ellen and trying to smile, "my hair is all gone, that's all; but how I lost it must remain a secret, and the only one I shall ever keep from you." No sooner did the words reach the lad's ears than his curiosity was aroused to an intense degree, and sliding down   I i from the wall, he hastenedt owards the l house, which Gregory had just entered, and stood wonderingly gazing at Nat's - shorn crown. His protector lead often I ridiculed him for being superstitious, and believing in spirits, but here, he thought, was tangible evidence of their visits to this mundane sphere. Gregory threw himself down on a bench near his desk, and folding his arms, began soliloquizing. "From the start," he said, "I suspect- ed that the critter shut up in the barrel belonged to Prudence Mather, and my conscience did trouble me some about keeping it. But now if I had a hundred of her pets, I'd clip off their ears and tails. Yes I would; indeed I would!" Dick presently sat himself by his side, but appeared not- to attract any ndtice. "It serves me right," continued flhe taxidermist, " for staying here so long, making a garden for those two women. I ought to have started off with nmy show-cart a fortnight ago, and by this time my things might have been all sold, and I on my way home with lots of money." At length, rising from his seat, he went out to take a look at Tommy, fol- lowed closely by Dick ; and -as soon as they were behind the cabin, he inform- ed the lad of his intention to leave im- mediately on his tour through the county. "You will of course remain at lhome, he said, " to take care of the place;   anrd do keep a good watch on the cow, c and see that she don't get again into i( the pound. Folks won't be apt to com- tl plain of her if she only grazes in the t lane and not on the Boston road. The t pumpkin-patch and the corn must be s Nvell weeded. And don't, Richard, sit c the whole live-long day reading. Book- r a.-ning is useful, no doubt; but unless 1 you jine practice with it, 'twon't amount 1 to much. Now, I'm afraid you ain't. ] enough inclined to work--to sweat-  yes, that's the word. If a person wants to succeeed in life, he must sweat. But there are two kinds of sweat, brain sweat and muscle sweat, and you have to put the two together in order to make a fortune. Farmers work till their hands are as hard as stone; but the smartest of 'em only make a decent living. Philosophers and students go to the other extreme; they only use their brains ; and did you ever know one that wasn't seedy-looking? Oh, Richard! don't get impatient (for the lad was whistling a tune and beating time with his foot); this won't be a long lecture.:' Then pausing a mo- ment, ( I'f all goes right with' me," he continued, "I shall return before two months are over, with cash enough to rig you out in a new suit of clothes; and perhaps 1'll be able to build a bet- ter dwelling than this when we move away from here; for you must know that we are to leave before the summer is out. Grumpy, or rather Colonel Solo- mon Onderdonk, as you requested me to call him, said the other day, that we had to go." "The old rip! The grumpy, snarly, reen-faced rogue!" exclaimed the lad, paying no heed to. Gregory; who, with uplifted finger was begging him not to speak so loud, as anytone passing in the lane might hear him. "He'll never be   called Colonel again!" continued Diclk. "I tell you, there's something more than you imagine in his ordering us off this acre. What it is I can't exactly -tell, but he's a tricky man. 'Twouldn't surprise me a bit if 'twas he that put our cow in the pound; and what's  more, I believe he's tired of having Lizzie to take care of, and has sent her to live with the old brown wigs, on pur- pose that-she may pine away; and 'twill very likely end so; for let me tell you, there's a devil in that house, and I wouldn't stay in it for all the world." It was now Gregory's turn to become restless: for although the glorious sun- light was streaming down upon him, these words recalled too vividly to his mind the sufferings of the past night- the bureau, the scissors, the cold sweat; , and instead of laughing, as he had al- \ ways done heretofore, whenever he r heard talk of ghosts, he groaned; and, , turning on his heel, walked away. ;  "He's convinced, at last, that I'm not a fool for believing in the superna- a tural," thought Dick, chuckling and - running after him. "You're not angry e with me, I hope, for anything I've said," D he exclaimed, seizing Nat by the arm. "Angry!" replied the taxidermist, ; with a trembling voice, "No Richard, - no indeed!" e  "Oh! I am glad, sir, for I didn't w mean to be impatient, really, I didn't! r Finish your lecture; I'll listen to it, )- no matter how long it is." e  "Well," said the young man, striving e to resume the thread of his remarks; "What if we do have to leave this y, cabin, I always believed there was a d, great fortune in store for me. To ob- :h tain it, however, I will have to drag my to cart many a mile along dusty roads; I ie shall be hooted at by impudent boys; ae sometimes even feel like despairing;  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7736-00000035"/> but then, when I think of the fine home, which one day I shall provide for Ellen, and yourself, I shall feel happy." "And when you think, too, of the public asking for your autograph," in- terrupted the lad, trying hard to keep the smile from breaking out upon his sun-burnt face. "Exactly so, Richard. But, boy, what ails you?" for the countenance of his young friend had suddenly grown thoughtful, even sad. "It was Lizzie that came into my head, sir. I can't bear to think she is in that horrid stone house. I wish I had seen her last evening. But I sup- pose Prudence heard my whistle and wouldn't let her come out of the house." "That was indeed the case ; but we i must hope for the best; and if Mr. ( Onderdonk iwishes to render her life  unhappy, there is all the more reason s why you should assist me in making a c fortune. Gold can unbar many a prison r door, and if I had as much now as I s expect to have by and by, I'd show up Prudence Mather and Solomon Onder- o donk, in a way that would make folks h stare ; for, Richard-" and here he low- w ered his voice-" though I never even fa whispered it to you before, I think just ir as you do, that there is something un- ly derhanded and wicked about those two in women.   Ellen has told me how her ye poor father went to ruin in Harvey Ma- ne ther's tavern ; and I can't help believ- Bt ing there are certain mysteries connect- hi ed with his fate, which ought to be th cleared up; and if I was rich I'd do it." ou While they were thus conversing, the a J young woman was hard at work, pre- ch paring the morning meal.     en "I'll try and make the corn-cake bet- litl ter than usual," she said, bustling car around the stove, " for I'm sure some- ke   ne thing unpleasant has occurred. Mr de Gregory needs a good breakfast to ,el make him cheerful again." Presently, Nat came back to the front he of the cabin, and seating himself in the n- door-way, he bent his gaze upon Ellen, :p and as he did so, his wonted happy is mood returned. Ellen's face, which, in its present disfigured state, most y, people would have called decidedly )f homely, appeared to him beautiful. n From the day when he first met her at White Plains, he had felt himself drawn y towards her by a strange and unac- s countable sympathy; which, as time I elapsed, had become intensified. Her I- patience and industry filled hinm with : admiration. He had never seen her ' temper ruffled; not even when it had : been necessary to ask Dick, half-a-doz- en times, to go to the spring for a pail  of water. He always found her doing something useful, and ever ready to sew on a  button, to put on a patch, or to repair a rent in his clothes, when such services were required. Even the probability of the total loss of her sight, did not appear to trouble her much. She seemed resigned to the will of God; and it was her example, far more than parson Jeremiah's preach- ing, which had kept his mind-natural- ly inclined to scepticism-from reject- ing all belief in revealed religion. And yet would you credit it, reader, he had never uttered the word love to Ellen? But now, as he sat on the threshold of his humble abode, it occurred to him that the time had fully arrived when he ought to declare his sentiments.- Many a  Sabbath he had accompanied her to church; he had made her many a pres- ent; spent more hours in arranging her little flower garden than on his show- cart; confided all his secrets to her keeping; in fact, he had done every.   thing that lovers usually do, with the exception we have just mentioned br What, then, had been the cause of his be baclwiardness? It was because there vas  mingled with his affection such a as profound sentiment of reverence; she appeared in his eyes so far above him- bf self, and above everybody else whom he had seen in this selfish world, that cl he had not yet presumed to ask her to e n become his wife.-         sI But, the village gossips ought not to be allowed even the shadow of a reason for being "' shocked " at the manner in l which this happy family lived. So, at t; this moment, while he was atiirirngly gazing at her, he was gradually n xlving s: himself for the crisis which he felt was s at hand. His fate must be decided  i now, before starting off with his stuffed v birds; and if she should accent his 1 ,proposal, his happiness, he thought, r would be complete. "And if she does lose her sight," he soliloquized, I'll toil harder than ever, and hire somebody to do her work."? While he thus meditaed, he saw her take a small -tin-pall, and brushing past him, she went off in the direction of the spring, for lazy Dick had not yet filled the bucket, which still lay at the foot of thestone-wall, "Let me get the water, Ellen," said Gregory, rapidly overtaking her. "Oh1, thank you, Mr. Gregory, I am still able to see my way; the path is clear enough; and, besides, I love the walk," replied Ellen. ' What! like these briars and lonely i woods! Oh! wouldl that I had a bet- ' ter home for you than this! A palace "A palace 1" she responded, slightly blushing as she threaded her way along ; "I'd not be a -bit happier than I am now."   "But, Ellen, wealth can certainly bring comforts. I expect by and by to be worth a million, and then---" "Will your heart be any lighter," she asked. interrupting him. "Yes, because all the money shall be yours." And as he said this, the blush on her cheek deepened; and until they reach- ed the fountain, not another word was spoken by either. "Popping the question is unpleasant business," thought Greg:r-y, " but a fel- low can't get a wife without it ;" then taking a long breath, he resumed: "Ellen it's now half-a-dozen 3ears since you and I first met. From the start I liked you, and have gcne on lik- ing you more and more; and now I want to know if you will consent to be something even nearer and dearer to me than a frirdM. Be-be my-be my wife." The young woman, while he was speaking, instead of casting down her eyes and looking confused, bent upon I him an expression of mingled wonder * and gratitude ; and when Nat took her I tenderly by the hand, though she made t no attempt to repel him, her counte- ; nance indicated a feeling of sadness rather than of joy. d "I am astonished, Mr. Gregory, that you should make such a proposal to n me," she replied, slowly, and with de- s liberation. "lMy sight is almost gene; e and although I may have been of some service to you thus far, ere long my y usefulness must cease, and then I should t- only be a burden.. .Go choose among :e the many farmers daughters, whom you know around here, some one better ly suited for that position than myself." ; "No, no I don't say so-don't talk m about blindness. Oh, Ellen! you may believe me a dreamer, but it shall be  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7736-00000036"/> no dream; it must come true! Fame and fortune are in store for me; I feel it, and my fondest hope for years has been to have you for my own darling wife. Yes, we'll live in a. splendid mansion yet! and Prudence Mather and Solomon Onderdonk shall envy you, Ellen. I'm sure of it. Had it not have been for them, your father would not have gone crazy; and let the parsons preach what they please, yet I say vengeance is sweet! Oh, speak! tell me you will be mine, and make me the happiest fellow in all creation!" While he thus gave vent to his pent- r up feelings, she, with head bowed down, i and her eyes gazing upon the reflection h of his figure in the fountain, appeared s less sadder than before. And why, it g   may be asked, did Ellen Fowler feel sad? It was riot because she regarded Nat Gregory unworthy of her.  Far from it. But, in view of her disfigured appearance and greatly impaired evWe- sight, she would not make him a suit- able companion for life. He had inl the most frank and ingenuous manner offered her his hand and healt, how- ever, and there was no alternative left her but to give an affirmative or nega- tive answer. She could not deny that she loved him; so, gently raising her eyes to his, she said with a smile: "You might have done better, Nathan- iel; but, since you are willing to be burdened with a poor creature like my- self, I do not feel at liberty to disre- gard your wishes.   CHAPTER X.   Irl-WO mornings after the'events re- par corded in the preceding chapter, for Dick rose at an earlier hour than usual, son and began making preparations for a Nal visit to New York.         lec -He knew that unless he went this  1 day, he would -aot be able to smake the tha journey until Gregory should have re- sta turned with his show-cart. Indeed, oth the young man had already delayed his so departure twenty-four hours to enable his his protege to make, the contemplated visit.               Py The lad had never yet seen the great pi city; and the descriptions which others jec had given him of it had made him ex- th tremely desirous of going and seeing da for himself. "Thile folks who live in that town, g must be quite a different set from those st around here," he thought, while he was ir performing his toilet, just as the robin was beginning his morning song. "No- c body in this neighborhood looks so a grand as that young lady who came to b see us the other day with her father." t But at this moment his heart must have reproached him, for he suddenly shook x his head, and exclaimed vdith some vc- Y hemence,' - Pshaw I she's not a bit bet- ] ter than Lizzie Onderdonk. I never s could love her as I do Lizzie. Still, there was something about her--I can't tell what-that fascinated me. Those ear-rings and bracelets; her manners; her voice; her graceful walk-ail, I suppose, had something to, do with it The noise he made in descending the ladder awoke Nat and Ellen, who pre-,   pared to follow him to the lower room, for the latter was anxious to get him some breakfast before he started, while Nat wished to give him a farewell lecture. It needs scarcely to be remarked. that the taxidermist was in an ecstatic state of mind; and how could it be otherwise, when she, to whom he was so devotedly attached, had accepted his offer of marriage. It had been agreed between the hap- py pair, that the wedding should take t place soon after his return from his pro- jected peddling tour, which, it was -thought. would occupy about thirty , days. "The tramp to town will do you , good, Richard," remarked Nat, as he e stood in the doorway inhaling the fresh s morning air. n  "I suppose that strange lady, who )- came here a few days ago, when I was o at work iii the old maids' garden, must ;o be wonderfully beautiful to tempt you " to walk so far." ,e "Humph! It's her father's library I )k want to see," responded Dick. "I 'c- wouldn't walk to New York to see the at- prettiest girl there; but that lady you er speak of said her father had a large ill, library, and I'm bound-to see it. Be- n't sides, who knows but she will lend me )se some of the works on Natural History, rs; for she says nobody handles them but 1 the servants, when they go to dust it." them? I think I could put them to a the better use than that." )re-. The .cow, this morning, fortunately  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7736-00000037"/> was easy to find, having been tethered, the evening before, only a short dis- tance from the gate, after enjoying sev- eral hours' pasture in Mr. Onder- donk's meadow, where the clover was very high . Ellen, therefore, did not'occupy much time in preparing the morning meal; and, certainly, the fresh milk and the bread and butter presented a most tempting appearance. The lad, how- ever, contrary to his usual custom, par- took very sparingly of them. The ex- citement produced by his contemplated visit to New York, depriving him of his appetite. When he had finished, Ellen did him up a lunch to eat on the road, I remarking that, as the journey was a i long one for a foot-traveler, he would v need it before he reached his destina- ( tion.               i "And here's my blessing," said Nat, c rising and pressing down the lad's cap s with both his hands; " it don't cost anything, and may be worL more than v you think."            v Dick laughed ; then, after promising a that he would surely be home again v before the moon rose, he departed on 1 his way.    I         it But he had hardly reached the end of t the path, when he glanced down at his o bare feet and wished from the bottom p of his heart that he 'had a pair of shoes to put on, for might not the great people n whom  he was about to visit deny lIim th admission into their parlor, if he pre- le sented himself thus?       I "ut I shall pick Miss Everet a bunch of wild flowers,'" he soliloquized, jo "and then, perhaps, she will not mind be my treading bon her fine carpets; much lit finer, no doubt, than Grumpy Solo- w; mon's.' After he had proceeded a short dis- th tance, he stopped and rolled his trow- sc   I, sers' legs up. above his ankles, so as to - keep them from being soiled by the - dust, then he hastened on at a still fast- - er gait towards the Boston turnpike, s keeping, however, a sharp look-out on both sides of him, for the flowers he iwanted. It did not take him long to ; gather a small bouquet, composed of a L dandelion, a buttercup, a honey-suckle, ta budding rose, and a few violets, all -grouped around a tiny sprig of cedar, to which the dew drops were still cling- ing; and as'he held it up admiringly, his heart beat quicker at the thought that, before twelve o'clock. Miss Ever- et's delicate hand might be grasping it. Lizzie Onderdonk seemed again quite forgotten; and he was walking on whistling gaily, when, of a sudden, his eye was arrested by something blue, fluttering from one of the lower branches of a hawthorn bush, just across the stone fence, at his right. "That will do to tie the nosegay with!" he exclaimed, reaching over the wall and pulling it towards him; "but, as I live, it's---yes----it's hers! the very ribbon she used to wear round her hair! Here are her initials marked n it." And immediately a sense of shame took possession of him as he thought of how unmindful he had been of his playmate and first love. "No! I'll keep this as a clear me- mento!" he said, kissing it, and then thrusting it into his pocket, where he left it to keep company with the dia- mond ring. And when he again resumed his journey, he did not feel as cheerful as before. The sky was blue, the air de- licious, he himself so free--but, where was Lizzie? "Who knows," he thought, "but' at this moment she may be shut up in some dark room; for Grumpy Solomon   and Prudence are capable of doing a anything to her that's wicked."  ti By this time 'le reached the high v road and turned his face west-ward, a the sun had risen, and most of the vil- c lage people were astir. The bar-keep- v er was just opening the tavern windows, a to let some of the foul atmosphere es- E cape, and several lads of about Dick's t age, who were standing in front of the door, greeted him familiarly as he went j past. But, although they' naturally i asked him where he was going,- and for : whom the flowers were, not one of them presumed to laugh or jeer at him, when thev found he was not disposed to gratify their curiosity.. The truth is, Dick was a recognized leader among them; and yet he had never been formally chosen to this posi- tion. But boys, it is knownhave their own mode of selecting their chiefs; and Dick's bold heart, which often had prompted him to climb to the tops of trees, lwhere none others dared to ven- ture, and whose strong arm was ever ready to defend a schoolmate, who was being imposed upon by another--had won for him a great name among his companions, and a word from his lips was law, as Solomon Onderdonk had cause to realize. In a few moments he was beyond the last dwelling in the village; and then, bidding good-bye to his young friends, he pursued his' journey to the city at an increased rate of speed. In one hour he reached the Bronx river, where he sat down to rest a few minutes, and as he rubbed the drops of perspiration from his face-"Four miles traveled," he said, "and ten still to go! 'Gregory is right; a fellow must sweat if. he wants to accomplish any- thing in this world." Hlis flowers, as we may imagine, were   already beginning to droop, not a par- ticle of dew remained on them, and he was strongly tempted to throw them away; which, we believe, he would have done, save that he thought such things were not to be obtained in large towns, and that Miss Everet would be only too glad to get these, no matter how faded they might be. After he had rested, he resumed his journey, but" not quite at such a rapid rate, and in a quarter of an hour he ar- rived at West-Farms, a place of more pretension if not of more importance than Eastchester. Here the tavern was called a hotel, and the pole in front of it was painted white and crowned by a gilded cap of liberty. The boys, whom he met in the main street through which his course lay, had quite a haughty air; and although he kept straight forward, and spoke -not a word, he perceived that two of the largest of them were following him and talking in under- tones, while many of the smaller ones assailed him with tantalizing epithets. Now Dick was anything but a cow- ard, and yet he could not help feeling that he was no longer on his own bat- tle-ground. And what at home would have excited his organ of combative- ness, at this moment was utterly un-  heeded. Perhaps he thought that, in , this case, discretion was the better part , of valor. His apparent unwillingness t to take offense only served to increase their impudence, and the two first men- K tioned, with a bragadocia air, approach- v ed him, one on each side, and demand- f ed, in an imperative tone, for whom the r nosegay was intended. As they put 1 the question they leaned forward as if it to smell the flowers, and at the same {- time essayed to trip him up. But in the twinkling of an eye, Dick assumed a e vugilistic attitude, and by a well-direct-  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7736-00000038"/> ed blow at one. caused both of his as- sailants to beat a hasty retreat, while the rest of the gang applauded him for his valor. Having vanquished his foes, the youthful pedestrian pursued his way unmolested, and did not make another halt until he had crossed Har- lem Bridge. Here he ventured to ask for a drink of water, and the man who handecdit to him appeared not a little surprised at his refusal, upon invi- tation, to " take a little bitters with it." Thus refreshed, he advanced briskly along the Third Avenue, passing through Yorkville, until by and by he began to see that he was getting into al- most another world. Vicious-looking boys, generally in gangs of half-a-dozen, and all of them with short cropped hair and pug noses, were loafing about the corners of the streets, seemingly having nothing to do but to toss coppers; and to his sur- prise they hardly noticed him. He 1 wondered greatly at the long and end- less rows of lamp-posts which lined the I way ; and the numerous church steeples t that towered towards the sky, produced X the impression that the inhabitants of r New York must be very religious; and ( yet the liquor stores that he passed a were so numerous, and there was such n a  villainous-looking set of men and s even boys 'in their vicinity, as if keep- fe ing guard, that the lad found it difficult h to reconcile this fact with any high de- is gree of godliness in the community. th After he had proceeded down the tt Bowery as far as Bond street (at that si period considered far up town), he fir thought it wise to inquire of somebody be whether he was going in the proper di- to rection to reach St. John's Square. at Accordingly, he addressed the first respectable looking individual whom he af met.               ou   Is- "Go through. Bond to Broadway. le young man, then down to Canal-turn or to your right, and when you've walked is a few blocks, make further inquiry," id promptly answered the citizen, who :e did not stop one instant, having kept r- on walking, and was full ten paces k away by the time the last word was o spoken. e  "What an  aw]ful hurry he's in!" i- thought Dick," 'twould just suit Gregory, "though; and he calls me young man, y too . Ha! I  must have grown some g since sun-rise." e  We do not pretend to say that the 1- direction which he received was suffi- ciently well remembered by him to ren- n der unnecessary any further question- i ing of passers-by.  Suffice it to say that he threaded his way safely through the crowd, which appeared something wonderful in itself. Nobody seemed to stare at him or even so much as no- tice him, The noise of wheels grew louder and louder as he approached the heart of the city.  All the world, he thought, were running a race; and just as he reached the corner of Broadway and Canal: street, he heard a loud yelling, and there, rushing towards him, pell- mell, came a large number of youths, some of them in red shirts, and the foremost one with a  trumpet in his hand, and rolling after them was a pol- ished, lightly built machine, unlike any- thing he had even dreamed of; and as they dashed plast him, a boy from the side-walk screamed out, " Where's the fire, Saxy?" and so excited did Dick become, that he was strongly tempted to throw his nosegay into the gutter and follow the engine. "What a town this is!" he exclaimed, after he had watched until they were out of sight. "It's mighty different   from Eastchester, or anything I ever saw before." Soon he came to Varick street, and then in a few moments he found him- self in a place where there was much less confusion and fewer people; and glancing up at one of the lamp-posts, he saw painted on it the words, "Saint John's Square." A fluttering of the heart now seized him, and for the se- cond time since leaving the cabin, he thought of his bare and dusty feet and patched trousers. Out of one of the mansions, in front of which he halted a moment to read the number, there issued a superbly- dressed, rather stout lady, who, as she descended the' steps slowly, and pant- ing with the exertion, waved her gloved hand at him, exclaiming, at the same time, "I've nothing to give you; be off!" "Humph! I do believe she takes me for a beggar 1" he murmured, half inclined to wait until she should reach the sidewalk and then inform her of her error. But he turned away morti- fied and not a little disconcerted, at the thought of meeting such a recep- tion at Mr. Everet's. As he moved on lie wondered whether he ought to apply for admission at the basement door or at the main entrance ; and he was yet debating the question with himself when he found that he had arrived at Har- riet's home. "Well, it's foolish to be bashful," he said, glancing up at the parlor windows draped with heavy crimson curtains, and then at the two bronze lions which seemed to be watching him oqneither side of the massive stone steps. ( I -mean no harm; and, besides, she told me to come." When he reached the top of the stone flight, he was about giving a   knock with his knuckles, when his eyes fell on a silver-plated bell-handle, and touching it as if he did not exactly know what it was, or afraid of hurting it, he gave a gentle pull. Almost im- mediately the door flew open and a portly, red-whiskered individual, attired in clothes finer than ever Solomon On- derdonk wore on the Sabbath, accosted him gruffly-  "Get out of here!" he cried, " and quickly too!" at the same time turning Dick round and giving him a push. "Doesn't Miss Everet live in this house?" asked the lad, in a tremulous voice. "Go down, I say!" repeated the ser-' vant; " victuals at the basement, not here." And giving Dick another shove, he retreated, closing the door after him, and leaving our young friend outside. l"Ha! it serves you right, green 'un!" bawled a dirty-faced urchin who was passing by with a basket of broken meats on his arm. "( This is your en- trance (pointing towards the basement), not that." But he paid no heed to anything he heard; he was, indeed, becoming be- wildered; and the words which Gre- gory had so often spoken, occurred to him now with ten-fold force. "Yes," he said, "many a time Nat' has told me that a fellow must sweat and grow rich if he wants the world to think anything of him. Gold builds these fine houses and gets people clothes without patches. Oh 1 I'll turn over a new leaf from this day forward. I'll unite arm-work with head-work; and when I visit New York again it shan't be in bare feet 1" He was now on the very point of starting back for the country, when, to his astonishment, he heard a sweet voice calling him, and turning round  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7736-00000039"/> he beheld Harriet smiling and beckon- ing him to enter. At once all remem- brance of the horrid red-whiskered man vanished; and advancing towards her, he crossed the threshold; then quickly and silently (for her fore-finger was raised to her lips) he followed her up the broad staircase, hardly noticing as he went the beautiful paintings, the superb chandeliers, or the statuary, everywhere visible. When they reach- ed the second story, his fair guide turned to the left, and conducted him into a large bed-room, where he found Mr. Everet sitting in a comfortable r rocking chair, reading a newspaper. As he entered, the banker rose and greeted him warmly, after which he in- g quired about Ellen Fowler, telling him i how pleasant a day he had spent with e them, and that he intended before long s to pay Mill-lane another visit. While 1I he was speaking, the young lady inter- tf rupted him a moment to whisper some- I thing in his ear, and then glided away. c Presently, Mr. Everet, placing his la hand familiarly on the lad's shoulder, h said that he desired him very much in to be present at his daughter's recep- a( tion, the last one of the season, and ly which was to be held in about an hour, th remarking that there was a dress suit hangillng up in the clothes-press at the th farther end of the apartment, which he th might put on. It belonged, he added, gr to a  nephew now absent in Boston, and th he felt-sure the clothes would fit. ag M When Dick heard this he was cer- ha tainly taken aback, and scarcely knew th what answer to make. And yet, how by could lie refuse when the gentleman Ar spoke so kindly?         pe; Without, however, waiting for any tan response, Mr. Everet went to the a   l clothes-press and produced a fine black shi suit, together with a pair of white stock- ent   :on-. ings, a shirt, cravat, and white ]kd em- gloves, all of'which tire lad gazed at red with wonderment as they were taken rds out one by one and placed uponl the ien bed. Then the gentleman showed 1hin ger a comb and brush, towel and soap, and ler after saying that he would return in ng less than an hour, he left the apltrt he ment. ry,  The first thing the lad did, when lie :h- found himself alone, was to stand in de front of a mirror, which was larpe m enough to allow his whole figure to be id seen; and as he gazed in it, he could le not help confessing that he presented a very sorry appearance. d  As for the flowers, he had quite foi- I- gotten to speak about them, but lie did n not regretithis, for they were all witl- h ered, and even the sprig of cedar wais g so covered with dust as to have almost e lost its native green. Can we wonder '- that he felt strangely at this moment? - But a  few hours before, in an humble cabin, the whole of which was barely s larger than thi{ single chamber; now , he was in the finest private residence i in the, city. Ten minutes ago denied * admission by the servant, then sudden- [ ly welcomed by the young mistress of the establishment and her parent. It was not until he had wasted half the time marveling at this adventure, that he commenced preparing for the grand reception; and when, after a thorough ablution and brushing, he again stood before the glass, he could hardly realize that he was gazing upon the poor boy who was refused admission by the rude, red-whiskered hireling. And even Mr. Everet, when he re-ap- peared, stared in admirationat the me- tamorphosis. The latter now produced a pair of gold sleeve buttons for his shirt, gave the cravat a slightly differ- ent tie, saw that the shoes and gloves   were exactly as they should be; then, bidding him follow him, he led the way :o the reception room. While they slowly descended, the lad received a few brief instructions as to how he ought to act; but they were clothed in such appropriate and father- ly language, that, although proud, he took no offense. "t You must tell thoseto whom you will be introduced, tha/'you are a Na- turalist, and have spent a great deal of time in the country for the purpose of better pursuing your favorite study," continued the millionaire. "Above all things do not hesitate in your answers, for boldness carries one through many a tight place." The youth, of course, listened respect- fully, but felt somewhat embarrassed in view of the novel and trying position in which he was to be placed. Pres- ently, however, when he remembered what Gregory had told him about hum- bugging the public, he felt relieved. H "Here I am," he soliloquized, " about to play the Brazilian catamount, at a fashionable lady's reception, and al- though in some respects it is fine fun, darn me if I don't feel kind o' queer; for who knows but some of the folks may find me out?" Here, let us remark, that his host would never have dreamed of doing such a thing as this himself; but his daughter had so earnestly begged to be allowed to amuse herself with their country visitor, that he had consented to perform his part of the play, to the best of his ability. Indeed, it served for a while to drive away his lowspirts ; and, although he did not suspect it, it was -partly on this very account that Harriet had devised the scheme. When they entered the drawing-room, they found nobody there but the young   mistress of the mansion, who was standing near the piano, gazing up at the picture which we have already no- ticed in another chapter--the farm- house, the brook, and the boy fishing, &amp;c. On their approach she turned to- wards them, when Mr. Everet introduc- ed Dick to her, in the usual formal style, just as though they had never met before ; and the bow which the lad made, considering it was the first one he had ever attempted, was really quite graceful. Both father and daughter felt at this moment strongly inclined to smile. They restrained themselves, however, and during the brief conversation which ensued, Dick presented her with the faded bunch of wild-flowers, and it gratified him beyond measure to see how graciously she received them. In a few moments, Mr. Everet led him to the further end of the parlor, where stood a table laden with delica- cies and several kinds of wine; and the banker insisted on his drinking a glass of Port, so that he might have strength and courage to endurdithe ap- proaching ordeal. Soon, the, company began to arrive. Among the first who appeared was Mrs. Merryweather, with her son James ; and the lad instantly recognized her as the lady who only a short while before had taken him for a beggar, and ordered him away from her stoop. Her dress, upon this occasion, was not quite so low in the neck as she was accustomed to wear at the assemblies or at evening receptions; nevertheless, it was low enough to make our rustic friend stare; and he could not help thinking how ludicrous it would be to see Mrs. Merryweather thus -attired on Mill-lane, either in the winter time, when the-snow-flakes were falling, or in  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7736-00000040"/> dog-days, when musquitoes and knats were numerous. The diamond cross on her breast certainly appeared to great advantage, and attracted his attention almost as soon as the pimple on her chin, which was, after all, nothing but a beauty spot -a concomitant of Madeira and rich sauces. The lady herself, however, did not think that this excrescence ad- ded to'her attractions, and only a week before she had consulted two eminent physicians in relation to it. One of these, Dr. Shivers, had recommended the water-cure; while the other, Dr. Greenman, had urged her to adopt a purely vegetable diet. Accordingly, difficult as it may be to credit it, she had this very morning commenced an abstemious mode of living. The beef- steak at breakfast had been left entire- ly to her son, she contenting herself with unbuttered toast dipped in chocolate. James would naturally have prefer- ; red to see his mother go off to some watering place, to Saratoga for instance, but she would not listen to such a sug- e gestion.              t There were two good reasons for re- I maining at home; first, her husband t was on the verge of the grave, and like. ti the auctioneer's hammer, "going, go- b ing," yet taking a  tantalizingly long c time to be gone; and she realized how a unseemly it would be for her to be ab- a: sent at the closing scene; and, second- ci ly, her perverse son was forever hang- hi ing around the skirts of Miss Everet, a course of conduct which came in con- b] flict with her own ambitious schemes. ar As we have already remarked, young at Merryweather did not at all resemble wl his mother. He had a   frank, jovial fo] countenance; and Dick, who studied it to carefully for a few'moments, could not help admiring his perfect ease and we   ats composure in the midst of so great a throng; whereas, he himself felt as if ast all the company were staring at him, ge, and, consequently, felt ill at ease. as  Of the many fashionable persons as- ch sembled on this occasion, it is not ne- ot cessary to say much. The girls were ch every one of them charming; and yet, 'r, the most beautiful of all was-Miss Ev- d- eret; who, while she returned the salu- ek tations of her admirers, and seemed to nt be conversing with half-a-dozen of them of at once, still held in her hand the wilt- :d ed nosegay which Dick had brought, r. and occasionally recognized his pres- a ence by a familiar nod. y,  We must not imagine that the youth e was treated rudely and left to his own n society; by, no means. The banker f- was only waiting to get through with - Mrs. Merryweather's solicitous inqui- h ries as to his health, and then, in turn, to ascertain the physical condition of - Mr. Merryweather, in order to intro- e duce Dick to her. ", Ah, indeed! a young Naturalist!" - exclaimed the leader of fashion, eyeing the sun-burnt and bashful visitor. - "Yes, one can see that he has been in the open air a  great deal-studying na- ture in her own haunts. He is remarka- bly handsome, too, and not bold in so- ciety, as so many of our young men are '-shaking her head as she spoke, and sighing so as to make the diamond cross sparkle. "I am happy to make his acquaintance." Dick, when he heard her say this, braced himself up as well as he could, and heartily desired that he might be able to retain his self-possession ; of which, however, he had some doubt, for already he felt his head beginning to swim. The introductions to the company were gone through with admirably, his   bow being all that could be desired by w the most exacting belle. So elegantly h done was it, that the banker concluded h he might leave them together, while he I strolled off to converse with other e guests. For a moment the lad fully maintain- w ed his self-possession; but, whether it s was that he believed Mrs. Merryweather n was beginning to recognize in him the supposed beggar, or that' her gaze over- t powered him, certain it is that, little by i little, his eye-lids dropped, until at last c he found himself looking at the cross. r The fat lady immediately smiled, and N her heart throbbed, for she always con- sidered it a triumph whenever her pet 1 ornament attracted attention; and again she heaved a deep sigh, so as to make it glitter. Exactly what he said to her, or she to him, during the next quarter of an hour, Dick could never distinctly re- collect. One thing, however, remained for many a day impressed upon his m;nd, and that was the miniature por- trait- of a lady which was placed upon the mantle-piece close to where he was standing. It is true he only gave it a single glance, but that was enough to make him start, and at once he forgot all about lMrs. Merryweather; and it was only when she tapped him on his arm with her fan and requested him to, bring her a glass of champagne, that his reverie was dispelled. Accordingly; threading his way as well as he could, (for the ladies' robes were like so many anacondas trying to coil themselves round his legs) to the further end of the room, where the refreshments were, and where he found a number of other youths assembled, and helping them- selves plentifully to the good things; he filled a glass with the sparklinguine, and was about bearing it to the lady   who had commanded his services, when he was again seized with the fancy that he was " the observed of all observers." He became embarrassed, nay bewilder- ed, and making a false step, fell full length upon the, floor. So absorbed was he in his idiosyncrasy, that he scarcely realized his awkward predica- ment until he heard a lady exclaim, "Oh, my dress!"It was all he waited to hear, for in another moment he was in the hall, then rushing down the front- door steps, at the no small risk of hi.; neck, he ran as fast as he could to- wards Canal street and Broadway.. And as he hastened along, Nat's hum- ble cabin seemed to him a far more desirable place than it was when lne started away from it' only a few hours. before to visit the modern Babel. How many minutes Mrs. Merry- weather was obliged to wait before she. got what she had asked for, we know not; nor need we conjecture what Mr.. Everet and his daughter said about the strange disappearance of their rustic friend. Let us rather follow Dick on his journey homeward. The policemen whom he met stared suspiciously at him, and several boys screamed out, "Mister, don't run off L without your hat." But he paid no at- tention to their jeers; he was bound ), for the green fields; and it was not un- t til he reached Harlem bridge, th'at he remembered he had left the ring and blue ribbon in the pocket of his old y trousers. But, even for the sake of re- s covering these he was not willing to. ff return, deeply though he regretted their A, loss, and mortified though he was at r having gone off with another person's i- clothes. The sun was just sinking below the e, horizon, when he 'caught a glimpse of [y the smoke curling out of the little stove.  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7736-00000041"/> pipe chimney. And when he heard the robins chirping, and saw Ellen milking the cow by the gate, with Gre- gory leaning against the stone wall, watching her, his heart beat for joy, and he declared to hil;nself. that it was well worth going through all he had since morning in order to feel as he now felt. The joyous Nat opened wide his I arms, and as he embraced him, declar- ( ed that he was a smart fellow, and had l not sweated for nothing--while Ellen X seemed puzzled and scarcely knew what 1 to say.     .        r "It's a strange story," remarked M Dick, scratching his bare head, " but p spirits had nothing to do with it." And n he glanced up at Nat as he spoke, and e: at once the jovial expression of his o: protector's countenance was succeeded do by one of, extreme gravity. One of e these days I'll make it all clear," re- al :marked Dick, "but now I'm tred and an   rd hungry, and I'd like to have my supper n and then go to bed." e- His wishes were complied with. Not I, a question was put to him about his , adventures, and after Ellen had seen s him drink a large bowl of-milk, and i devour almost half a loaf of b)reacl  she gave him a kiss and sent him up to his roost. He was soon asleep, but , his repose was much disturbed by dreams during the night. He found himself again staring at the Merry- weather cross; saw the pimple on the lady's chin grown, to the size of a cher- ry; beheld, at his bedside, the lady whose portrait had made such an im- pression upon him, clad in deep mourning, her countenance sad in the extreme; and, although somewhat older, her resemblance to Lizzie Onder- donk was striking; and when she open- ed her lips to speak, he gave a start, awoke, and lo! the day had dawned, and Nat was already astir.    CHAPTER XI.   THS morning Gregory left the cabin on his long-delayed excursion. The show-cart had received a new coat of paint, its wheels had been well greased, and the collection of birds and animals never looked so fine as now. The sky was clear, not a cloud was visible in any direction, and Ellen had spoken such sweet words to him just before he passed through the gate, that it is doubtful whether any occurrence, however-adverse, could have brought a frown to his brow, not even excepting being confronted with Prudence Ma- ther. But there was one creature, which, as it sat fastened by a small chain to the pole of the cart, seemed to be in anything but a good humor, for it kept uttering low growls, and turned its head away from the sun-light, as if the rays were painful. This animal was the Brazilian catamount, which, in its coat of deep red, presented certainly a wild, outlandish appearance. For a mile or so, Dick accompanied his protector, and until there was no longer any danger of meeting Solomon Onderdonk, who, being an early riser, might, perchance, have fallen in with the young man and recognized Tommy in spite of the disguise, in which case there might have been trouble. Gre- gory, moreover, was very glad of the lad's company, as it afforded him an opportunity of giving him some part- ing advice. (' While I'm away, Richard," said he,   "I beg you to keep the garden nicely weeded; keep a sharp look out after the cow; be always ready to go to the spring for water; and if you do have any spare time, run to the carpenter's shop and try and learn something of the trade. Remember, if you want books, you must have money to buy them; folks won't always be lending 'em to you. Lizzie may remain in the old stone house ever so long, and I guess Colonel-- " "Grumpy I not Colonel!" interrupt- ed Dick. "Well, I guess Grumpy Solomoni won't be willing to let you enter his. house as his daughter did, and carry away volume after volume. But if all goes smooth, and you and I pull to-- gether, the day will come when we'll not be so poor' as now. Almost all those rich men in New York began at the foot of the ladder; some of 'em ; even without shoes and stockings, and t as ragged as you were before you visit- ed the city. And this brings me to: I speak of Mr. Everet, who, I doubt not, i made you a present of that fine suit. I  Dick laughed, and replied that it , might be the case. 1  "Well, Richard," continued the taxi- , dermist, smiling, "'you did right to ac-  cept them; false pride, generally, ends - in a ditch. Take all you can get in e this world, provided your conscience i rests easy; when that begins to prick - you, why then it's time to hesitate. In such clothes as you have on now, you , might obtain many a situation which.  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7736-00000042"/> you are capable of filling; but which, if poorly clad, you never could obtain without undergoing a hard apprentice- ship. -Why, those pants fit splendidly, and if they were only a little longer and moore roomy, I'd ask the loan of them for myself. In fact, Richard, your trip to New York was a success; you only made one blunder, and that was in not hinting to the gentleman that you needed a new hat. But I won't find fault, for you must really have had great tact, and spoken in a way to interest him and his daughter; Rand if they have taken a fancy to you, why, in the end it may prove a good thing for us all. And now, before we :separate, let me assure you that I much ,regret having to leave you behind, for ,were you with me you would learn a great deal, far more than books can teach.  Think how interesting it will ] -be to see folks with gaping mouths ,crowding round Prudence's cat and ac- 1 tually believing it an imported animal r ,from  Brazil! Will it not prove that i nine persons out of ten are simpletons? E That men and women are, after all, ,only grown  up babies? And I say, r Richatd, if a fellow can make a for- n tune by humbugging them, why let a him I  They are amused, and I am u benefitted, and my conscience need not be disturbed in the least; for after I tl have made my fortune, I intend to be fi ,exceedingly, generous to the poor; a no thing which I can't be at present. Now bi I've finished talking, and you'd better in ,go back as fast as you can, so as not va to leave Ellen long by herself." w The lad grasped his protector's hand, th ,bade him farewell, and then started off jo for the cabin; -and as he went, he said pa to himself, more than once, "It's 'cheek' he that wins I  If this catamount takes, I w. *can catch plenty more-ha, ha."  sa   h,  The first place which Nat intended in visiting was Yonker's, a pretty town sit- e- uated on the left bank of the Hudson y, river, where nobody knew him, and er where he expected to find a ready mar- of ket for a goodly portion of his collec- d, tion. ;  As we have said, his spirits this it morning were jubilant; and although n the day was already getting warm, and I the drops of perspiration were begin- y ning to trickle down his face, he tugged a at his load with more than his usual ; energy. ,  Soon he commenced thinking of what 1 Ellen had told him, in confidence, about i Mr. Everet, and he thus soliloquized: I  "Melancholy, indeed! And believes r that he'll die a beggar, when he's worth at least a million! Oh, just wait till I have anything like that amount! Catch me feeling down in the mouth." .Occasionally he  would stop, and throw himself upon the road-side a moment to rest, for there were hills to mount, and  seven long miles before him. A fine breeze from the south west raised the dust and filled his eyes and mouth, but still he continued jovial, and once even tried to whistle, a most unusual thing for him. When noon-time came, and he heard the horns blowing from the different farm houses, calling the laborers to din- ner, he was reminded of a certain little bundle which Ellen had stowed away in one corner of his cart. So, after ad vancing a  short distance fui-ther, to where a large tree threw a shade across the road, he halted and prepared to en- joy his mid-day meal. On opening the package, he found the best of all that her slender larder afforded.  There was salt and pepper, six or seven bacon sandwiches, as many potatoes, roasted   just as he liked them, some hard boiled or eggs, and a pumpkin pie. It is proba- hi ble that a city-bred youth might not have found all this so palatable, but sa Nat did ; and being a fast eater, it was w not long before the whole disappeared. S He left, however, a few crumbs, to the great delight of a sparrow, which flew w down from the tree, hopped around h him, and came up quite close, as if it ta knew he would do it no harm. Presently his attention was drawn to h a couple of farmers' boys driving past in an oxcart, and at once he commenc- ed an imaginary lecture to Dick:  g "Those fellows," he said, "sweat i hard, too hard, in fact; but, then, what does it profit them i I can make a for- n tune three, yes, six times as fast as a they can! Ha! catch me hoeing corn, f when by a little head-work an ordinary r tom cat can be changed into such a f curiosity as this i" glancing towards the old maid's pet, which must have known what was passing through his mind, for it gave an angry howl. After resting here for half an hour or so, he arose, and was about continuing his journey, when the sound of a horse trotting caused himr to look round; and whom should he see approaching through a lane which led into the main road, close to where he was, but Mr. Onderdonk?  I "Ha! old Grumpy's like the evil one himself, is on hand when he's least expected!" he exclaimed, with rather an anxious countenance. "Been off, no doubt, buying calves at half price, or collecting notes from the farmers. Humph! he's got money lent in every direction. Smart enough for most people, but I know a chap he can't bam- boozle." And as the retired distiller drew near,   our friend closed one eye and watched him with a most comical expression. "Good day, Colonel!" he presently said, prefering to call him by a name 'which he knew would please him. Splendid weather!"  1"'Tis, indeed, and nice for your cart wheels," answered Solomon, rising in his saddle and assuming quite a mili- tary air. "Sold anything yet?" Gregory shook his head, informing him that he had only set out a few hours previously. "But I guess it won't take you a great while to dispose of your stock- I'm sure you understand the art of sell- ing.," "t Well, really, Colonel, I am begin- ning to comprehend it; it takes time s and practice, however, to become per- ' feet. Still, I can turn my hand to al- Y most anything, and if I don't make my a fortune this way, I shall .in another. e When you get to be Supervisor, you n must give me a lift, eh?" "r ' Supervisor I why, what put that in- to your head? I haven't even thought r of running for any office." g  "( Perhaps you ain't, but the people, e Colonel, vith whom you are growing d more and minore popular, will put you on Lg the ticket and elect you, too, whether in you like it or not; and after that the r. Legislature, and then Congress, and then --why, sir, there's no telling how il high up a man of talent like you may st climb. I expect to see you perched on er the tip-top of the ladder yet. And ff, when you get to be President, ah 1 :e, don't forget poor Gregory!" rs. Mr. Onderdonk, who believed that ry the young man was in earnest, felt st highly flattered by the compliment, and m- at this moment had there been no such person as Prudence- Mather in exist- ar, ence, he -would probably have made i'  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7736-00000043"/> over to Nat in fee simple the acre of ground on which the cabin stood. But, in imagination, he beheld the -ld maid's frowning face, anddared not venture more than an approving smile. "All I ask of you at present, sir," continued the taxidermist, ,.is not to turn me off that piece of land till the Spring. I'll remember your kindness, when election day comes round. I can control lots of votes." While they were thus conversing, Mr Onderdonk's eyes became fastened on the cat, but his countenance revealed no indication of astonishment or curi- I osity. This, however, far from putting t Nat at his ease, made him, on the con- v trary, more nervous than before, for he t knew that the widower had a keen vis- fi ion, and at the same time was exceed- v ingly cunning; so that he might recog- s nize the old maid's favorite in this painted beast, and still not make any n remark about it at the moment.  r After a few more words, Solomon re wished him a pleasant journey, then se striking his heels against his horse's ec flanks, cantered off in the direction of wl Eastchester. The young man stood gazing after ne him for a moment or so, muttering be- st' tween his teeth something about "' cun- the ning rascal," "old rip," and then re- un sumed his journey.        to The force of the maxim, "a guilty pre conscience needs no accuser," was ex- ing emplified in the case of Gregory, in soc connection with the old maid's cat; and Mr it is not surprising that he felt quite pric nervous during this interview with her tair particular friend ; but one thought con- the soled him--his experience at the man- alw sion on that eventful night when his thei crown was laid bare, had placed the day ancient maidens in his power, and he dirt felt that Prudence-if she were properly wel   of named-would not dare to pursue him in quest of her favorite--peradventure the Mr. Onderdonk recognized it and not should inform against him-nor even le. accuse him of appropriating it, lest he r," should divulge a secret she was most to anxious should not come to the light. Ie  ( "After all," he said, "it's only tit for s, tat, Tommy versus shaved head, ha, m ha!" and as he laughed everything around him seemed once more as bright ;r. and beautiful as before his meeting withl n Mr. Onderdonk. d  During the interval that had elapsed i- his hair had grown wonderfully, thanks g to a peculiar invention of his own, with '- which he had bathed the bald spot, so e that, at present, it stood up in bristles - full a quarter of an inch long, and he - was no longer in dread of being made - sport of. s  Leaving him now to pursue his jour. h ney towards Yonker's, let us follow the retired distiller, and see what he did on reaching his home. Lizzie being ab- sent, the house had a strangely desert- ed appearance. A brood of field mice, which Dick had made her a present of, and which she kept in a small cage be- neath the stair-case, were well nigh starved to death; and no wonder, for they had not been fed since her depart- ure; while hopping about from room to room was a tame rabbit-likewise a present of the lad's-seemingly roanm- ing the house over for its mistress. No sooner, however, did the creature hear Mr. Onderdonk's heavy tread than it pricked up its long ears as if to ascer- tain who had entered the premises, and then ran away to hide, for the man had always hated the girl's pets, calling them nuisances and grumbling halfthe day if he discovered the least speck of dirt anywhere--and "Bunny" knew too well what kind of greeting it might ex-   pect if it got within the cross-grained old fellow's reach. Feeling somewhat fatigued by the ride, Solomon, as soon as he closed the door, divested himself of-his boots, and thrusting his large ungainly feet into a pair of slippers, threw himself upon the sofa in the sitting room; but almost immediately he rose again, as th6ughi be had forgotten something; and glid- ing softly across the entry (for he did not wish to be heard by the servant maid), went into another aparment, where stood a closet, the key ofwhich he always carried in his pocket. Here it was that a bottle of old rye was hidden. And so well had the secret been kept, that not even Prudence Mather knew anything of it. He poured out about half a tumblerful and drank it off with- out the slightest dilution, after which he smacked his lips loud enough almost to be heard in the kitchen. From this, do not infer, reader, that he was an intemperate man. Far from it -at least so said his neighbors, for whose good opinion he had the greatest regard. Nor had he ever been seen near the tavern; but, on the contrary, had strongly advocated the passage of alaw prohibiting the sale of ardent spirits in those places-and on the Sab- bath, when on his way to church, and while numbers of pious people were within hearing, he would frequently designate them as " sinks of iniquity." In fact, but for his moroseness, he might have been considered a model. "Yes, I'm glad she's gone," he said after he had returned to the sofa, " it was foolish in me ever to bring her here, and I wish she'd be taken sick, and- and--never come back!" As the parlor blinds were closed and the house very still, it was not Long ere Mr. Onderdonk was wrapped in the   arms of Morpheus; and he would no  doubt have enjoyed a good nap, and have waked up far less inclined to growl, had not a knock at the door sud- denly roused him. "It's Prudence," he exclaimed, . springing to his feet and hastening to admit her. He was right, the maid of the itching nose stood before him. The greeting, as usual, was a warm one, and the rabbit, as it viewed them from a distant corner, must have thought that Platonic affection was a powerful agent, thus to bring in close contact the lips of two such homely individuals. When the first embrace was over, he led her to the sofa, and then taking a seat by her side, eyed her with keen affection; and soon thelittle finger of her left hand began -worming itself through one of the button holes of his coat, where it had so often been before. "I've come," she said, "to have a serious talk with you about your daugh- ter--she's the stubbornest thing I ever met--hardly spoken a word since she arrived; and as for makingthe place any less gloomy for sister, why she might as well be back here. When Nat Gregory came to visit us t'other night she did seem to wake up a little, and had her private signals with him, and I guess was trying to get news of that vagabond Dick who comes sneaking around after dark, whistling for her. But since then she's grown sulkier than ever, and Abbe wants me to fetch her home again. But I guess, Solomon, you don't care about having her, eh?" And as she spoke the old fiendish expression came over her countenance, while her finger gave a jerk at his but- ton hole. "Humph! Miss Abigail fears she mnay go into a decline, I suppose!" re- plied Mr. Onderdonk.  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7736-00000044"/> "And what if she does?" resumed Prudence; " haven't as pretty creatures as she died of consumption afore this?" Then lowering her voice to a whisper, "Wouclnl't you be a fool, man," said she, "to wish her to live and inherit the land which your wife left--as by the will she must do-when, if she is out of the way, it will all be yours?" "True, Prudence; and now I will confess that that idea has occurred to me more than once-but I never spoke to you about it, which was wrong, for I promised there should be -no secrets between us! but when you took Lizzie i off, I didi't expect her to retlun." "And  she never shall, Solomon. i Would I be so ungrateful as not to help s you attain your object? You, who ren- e dered Harvey such a service years ago, i in kidnapping Norris!" The property here mentioned as hav- v ing been bequeathed by Mrs. Onderdonk h to her adopted daughter, was the farm b on which this pretentious house with the tall cupola and Grecian columns, tl stood.  And after Solomon had spent n so much money in beautifying the man- d sion, not to own the ground beneath it, II was something more than he could bear fa to think of.            The object of the old maid's visit, o: namely, to ascertain whether he would in enter with her into a conspiracy against ri a  second person's life, being now suc- B cesofully accomplished, she prepared to fo leave, feeling in the best possible hu- sh mor, and longing to begin the system dE of treatment which was to shorten Liz- st zie's days. Why she was desirous of having, the fo girl disposed of, is of course not diffi- siE cult to conjecture. Were not the yo chances ten to one, if Mr. Onderdonk no came into possession of the land, that bu she, for whom he felt so much love, he   ed would be benefitted by his increase of es wealth? And who knows what visions- ?" she may have had of the future, when r, the retired distiller would -be safely id lodged in the chutch-yard, and she a -it sorrow-stricken widow and the inheritor ie of all his property? It  But stop a moment," said Solomon, as lie adjusted her shawl about her "shoulders, "' and tell me how the crazy o man gets on?" e "Oh; he's doing well, and that means I --ha, ha! that means-you know what. s And yet I confess it's too slow work e for my taste; another year may be re- quired to finish him. But, then, sister  is so nervous and chicken-hearted, that she always gets a fit of the blues when- - ever I talk about making a clean job of , it-and once she went into hysterics." "Humph! Miss Abigail ought to be watched," resumed Solomon, shaking his head. "Remember I told you once before that I feared she might----" "Bah! I   repeat now what I said then," exclaimed the old maid, indig- nantly; "I know her better than you do, and all her shudderings and la- mentations would never make her play false I I've got her under my thumb --I always did .rule her, and if she's only treated gently, and with tact, she may be persuaded to join us in getting rid of Norris, sooner than you suppose. But, depend upon it, she cannot be forced into it; any violence might so shatter her nerves as to cause her own death. So trust me, and all will be straight before a great while." 4 "Well Prudence, I will : it is wrong for me ever to say a word against your sister; forgive me. I know she hasn't your courage and resolution ; and the noises which the rats make in the building, no doubt worry her and make her very timid."   ': But there isn't a rat on the place, c except one grey beard, and he-keeps g entirely to himself in the mill; there- 1 fore the rappings on the wall must be caused by something else. There are c -times, Solomon, when we hear, distinct- i ly, footsteps in the entry, and yet not a 1 soul can be seen walking about'; and I e half believe that it may be an evil i spirit; and these strange noises affect . ine more than sister'supposes."  1 She now turned again towards the I hall door to depart, but Mr. Onder- X donk a second time stopped her.  i "Don't go yet," he said; "I have f something of great interest to tell you, ' I kept it for the last, which is always best, when 'tis good news. I met Gre- gory a couple of hours ago, on the Yonker's road with his show-cart; and what do you think was sitting on the pole?" "My Tommy!" exclaimed the old maid, throwing up her arms. "Yes, it was he, sure enough!" "Dear, oh dear! if you'd been lost yourself, and then found, I'd not be happier. But proceed, proceed!" "Well, that's all. The young man went on his way and I hastened back to tell you about it. And I should have. gone at once to your house, only I knew you'd be here. But stop! I did forget to mention that your pet's ; tail has been cut off, and he has been painted red." "The villain! the wretch!" scream- ed Prudence, clenching her fists, her countenance being livid with rage. And as Solomon stood looking at her, there stole over him a feeling of intense delight at the thought that this tempest was not going to burst upon his own head. "I shall start immediately in pur- suit!" she continued, " and you must i   come with me. And woe, woe to Gre- gory when Prudence Mather catches him!" Now the anxiety manifested by Pru- dence for the recovery of her pet wals, perhaps, natural enough, since she loved the creature dearly, and it seem- ed to love her, and Solomon was anx- ious himself that she should get it again. But having eaten nothing since breakfast, he was loath to go, without his dinner, so he suggested the delay of an hour, at the same time remind- ing her that it would be better to in- form her sister of her plans, or other- wise Abigail might feel alarmed at her absence. The old maid acknowledged the force of this appeal, and giving him a squeeze of the hand, she hastened out of the house and drove back to the creek as briskly as her nag could carry her. No sooner was she out of sight than the worthy advocate of total abstinence re- paired again to the closet, and took another and a stronger potation ; then, having rung the bell, he gave orders to the servant to bring up the dinner. That he was in even worse humnor : than when the old maid arrived was [ evident, and on what account? O silly man! merely because in her-ecstacy of [ joy at the prospect of recovering Tom- s my, she had declared that if lie himself a had been lost and found it would not have given her more pleasure. "Yes," he muttered as he took his r seat at the table and made a voracious ,. attack on the beefsteak, " it was a bold r, thing to tell me to my face! tiumph! I e almost wish that Nat may escape." ;t The next hour seemed positively to n flyi as time always will when we wish it to pass slowly, and when the old maid r- knocked at the door agaih, five minutes ;t seemed scarcely to have tlapsed. That-  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7736-00000045"/> she meant business, could be told at a glance. She appeared taller, her eyes had a stranger glare, in one hand she held an ancient umbrella, and in the other an equally ancient carpet-bag. "You're very slow, Solomon," she exclaimed, looking down at his slipper- ed feet, as he stood wiping his mouth. He made no reply, but walked into the entry, where he had left his boots, and as she watched him she fancied that she detected a queer unsteadiness in his gait; and she noticed that when he stooped he could scarcely maintain his equilibrium. "You've been drinking!" she said in ; a savage whisper, and placing her hand ; on his shoulder, as if to steady him, but - in reality giving him a hard pinch. s "And I begin to think it ain't the only s thing you do on the sly." The retired distiller, without even o   at looking up, kept pulling away at his :s boots and muttering something about "spirits" and "confounded cat." e  He was not, however, really inebriat- ed, he was only gay, as he expressed e it; and consequently it did not pre- - vent him climbing up into Prudence's gig almost as nimbly as herself, and he : even made an attempt to seize th- I reins. But these she indic, nar'y snatched away, declaring 'Ltat he , at not fit to drive. He succeeded, thoug, in getting hold of the whip, and forth with began plying it vigorously across the haunches of the astonished Buceph- alus, who dashed through Eastc ester at a gait somewhere between a trot and a gallop, and every time she remon- strated with him he would giggle and say: "Its only the old rye, dear, working off."   CHAPTER Xri.   T HERE was a very marked improve- ment in Dick after Gregory's de- parture. While he was as fond as ever of sitting on the stone wall with his book, Ellen was not obliged to ask him a second time to go to the spring for water. The cow was always driven home at a reasonable hour for milking, and not a weed was allowed to show itself in the garden. But this change may be attributed not so much to Nat's frequent lecturing, which, however, had produced some effect, as to the red- whiskered servant who had refused to admit him into Mr. Everet's house. From that moment he had realized the vital importance of being industrious, and of making money, if he ever ex- pected to hold his head up in the world, the inhabiters whereof, in spite of the Philosophers, will never think so much of a person in poor garments as of one who is well clad. Nay, even the Tem- ple of Fame, in these modern days, is easier to reach if you journey towards it in good broad-cloth, polished boots and clean linen. It may be said, however, as a cause for much of his past application to reading, that Gregory had taken upon his own shoulders all the burthen of supporting the happy family; and if he had been less active, Dick might have been more so. Nat, as we know, could build a house, make a clock, stuff birds, spade a garden, write autographs, and, in fact, took such a decided pleas- ure in "running the whole machine," as he once told Ellen when she was   begging him not to exert himself too hard, that it is probable had there been anybody to assist him, he would not have been so contented a fellow. Two evenings after Nat had left, the lad resolved to go again to the old stone house, and make another attempt to procure an interview with Lizzie. The chances of success were certainly this time more in his favor, for Prudence was away in search of her cat, and Ab- igail exercised a much less strict sur- veillance over the young girl. Accordingly, after he and Ellen had finished their supper, the lad put on his cap and went off without letting her' know where he was going. A quarter of an hour's walk brought him to a point where the lane,' -emerging from the woods, came abruptly to an end at the edge of the salt meadow. Here he stopped to reconnoitre. It was just dark, and shining through the bean- poles on his left (for the gardens lay between himself and the house), was a light, and he could see figures moving around it; and heard some one, in im- ploring tones, beseeching another to enter. ( "Do come in!" cried a voice, which, ' he recognized as Abbe's. F "Come back to your loom! Oh I t what shall I do!" Making as little noise as possible, f Dick now advanced nearer, his heart , beating, until presently he was only a - few yards distant from the lamp. The ' spectacle which at this moment he be- s held was indeed a singular one. Near-  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7736-00000046"/> est to him stood the younger of the old maids with Lizzie at her side, while facing them was a person clad in a long gown, with cadaverous features, and hair falling down over his shoulders. Prudence was not to be seen ; and he was rather surprised at this, for he was not aware of her absence. "Leave me alone!" exclaimed the strange being, endeavoring to loosen Abigail's fingers, which were fastened on his sleeve; "I shant go way from her I She's my own dear Emma, come r at last! Let me embrace her!" and as he spoke, he leaned forward as if to seize the girl, who shrunk behind the woman for protection. "Oh! what shall I do? I am lost!" sobbed poor Abbe, endeavoring to re- strain him, but in vain, for already he had freed 'himself from her grasp, and thrown his thin arms around Lizzie's neck. At this instant Dick rushed towards the group, and no sooner did the old maid recognize him, than forgetting a how easily she might compromise her- X self as well as her sister, by not hold-  ing her tongue, she wrung her hands,  and cried out, "Oh, dear i oh, dear! i we are discovered! it is the finger of t God!"               i Fortunately, however, the lad paid no c heed to her words; all he thought, or f cared about, was to rescue the girl, who i seeil d to be i-t danger of violence at s the hands of some mad man. So, seiz- a ing her by the wrist, he dragged her off a wirlout ceremony into the lane, and il wlhen hie got ttere he did not stop an s instant to ask any explanation of the -i scene he had witnessed, but still hold- P ing her fast, as ii he feared they might h be pursued, he hurried towards the h cabin. Abigail, when she found herself alone r   d with Norris, almost fainted away. Rapl e pily, however, she did not quite lose ,g her consciousness. She knew that if 1 the prisoner escaped both she and her sister, and Solomon Onderdonk, would soon be brought to' justice for their s treatment of this unhappy being, who for years; had been incarcerated in the ' north-east room, until at last his reason i had fled. But it is more than probable that, if such a step would not have brought danger upon others besides her- self, Abbe would not have hesitated about restoring Norris to liberty-and even conducting him to the village, and there surrendering herself to a magis- trate, for we know how much she re- gretted ever having anything to do with this crime; and how perseveringly she had besought Prudence to treat him with mercy and not murder him out- right.       .; But she loved her siser dearly, and for her sake, therefore, she resolved to bring the maniac back to his room, if she possibly could. This no doubt showed weakness on her part, but in critical moments the ties of blood are generally stronger than the ten com- mandments. But when she undertook to compel Norris to re-enter the build- ing, she found that she was unable to do so. He had no idea of obeying her, for this was his first breath of fresh air in years. Almost in despair, /lerefore, she remained standing between him and the lane, holding fast to his gown and praying that her sister might speed- ily return. She knew that the scolding she would receive for her carelessness in letting  him out would be severe. Nevertheless, she resolved to bow her head and accept it in meekness, as she had done so many times before. Might not Dick and Lizzie, however, run to the village and tell whom they   had seen? If they did so it wouldjec matter little whether Norris returned ' hi to his chamber or not, for in that case c the public would soon be here with cu- h rious eyes to ferret out all the myster- cl ies of the old stone house. Imagine, g then, her feelings when she heard the distant rumbling of wheels. The sound h grew nearer. Who was approaching? s And as she listened, the cold drops v started out upon her brows, while the s maniac ceased crying, and lifting up a his forefinger, exclaimed:     t "Hark! Hark!-there comes my i Emma back!' Then he began to clap his emaciated hands, and so con- tinued until Solomon and the old maid t drove up. The first words of greeting were rudely cut short as the elder sister's ] eyes fell upon him. "Oh, it was an ac- ] cident," cried Abbe, hysterically; "it J was, indeed; when I went to take him his supper, he slipped past me. I couldn't help it, indeed I couldn't!" ' Hush! no lies," screamed the other, actually foaming at the mouth and let- ting Tommy drop out of her arms. "Your soft, foolish heart will yet prove the ruin of us all. But the girl-the girl-where is she?" This question had to be repeated sev- eral times before Abigail could summon courage enough to reply; and when she did open her lips, her voice could scarcely be heard. "Then she has escaped, has she?" cried Prudence, with something like a hiss, and hardly able to restrain her long nails from t .ring out her sister's eyes. "Oh! curse your stupidity 1" Mr. Onderdonk, on his return from the stable, whither he had gone to put the horse away, appeared, strange as it may seem, less excited than the woman, when he discovered what had happen-   ed. At least he did not give vent to his wrath in such loud tones. But his countenance grew paler than hers, and his knees trembled, for his fear of the consequence was full as great, if not greater. "'Tis truly a bad piece of business," he said, " but we must not remain out- side talking about it, for we can't tell who's listening--open the door, and I'll see whether this gentleman will go in or not." With the aid of the elder sis- ter, the maniac was now pushed back into the house. "Before we go any farther," resumed Solomon, "I wish to say a few words to you," looking savagely at Abigail, who was holding the lamp; "what has , happened this evening, never must, , never shall occur again! No 1 I swear it shan't! and now, I insist on your t joining Prudence and me in making a i clean job of this-do you hear?" [  As he spoke, the frown on the face , of the elder sister faded away-for al- , though she was so ready to scold Abbe, herself, she was not willing that any ;. body else should share in that privilege. e And when she beheld the poor creature e looking so humble, her heart softened and she turned her gray eyes on Solo- r- mon. But he appeared not to under- n stand the meaning of her glance, and n in the same harsh voice he continued: "d "Therefore, I insist that Norris be put where he'll never again trouble us. , Either in the mill pond, where there are a lots of eels and crabs, or out in the Ig Sound, where the water is deep, and  where there's no. end of lobsters and sharks."  m  Abigail, while he was thus addres3- ut ing her, made no attempt to reply; she it merely uttered a low moan, and when t,n he got-through with what he had to say, in- she turned around, put one of her hands  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7736-00000047"/> to her eyes, and went off sobbing to her chamber. "Let me manage her," said Pru- dence; "you can't do anything with her." "Humph! But you've .been very weak thus far!" he replied. At these words the eyes of the old maid flashed. Nevertheless, she smoth- ered her wrath, and answered i nmedi- ately: "Well, perhaps I have. Here- after I shall be firmer. But; do you know that Lizzie has escaped with that young vagabond, Dick?"      , ("Her name is not Lizzie, she's my X Emma," cried the prisoner, suddenly rising from the bench on which he had c thrown himself. "Bring her back--do a -do, for the Lord's sake 1"   n As he spoke, both Onderdonk and f( Prudence gave a start, and when the h full meaning of his words broke upon b them, they were for some minutes too b. much panic-stricken to utter a word. he "Can it be that Lizzie is his daughter, do or is it that he mistakes her for his sa wife, or somebody whom he has once ar loved?" whispered the old maid. "Oh, th Solomon, Solomon, why did you pick set up a child at random, and without in- wi quiring who were its parents? I told aft you long ago that it might turn out po badly; and sure enough it has. Oh, I I Solomon!"            wo "Well, what if she should be his got child? Isn't it agreed between us that you she's to be got rid of too? And that  will be only one more reason for doing ing it. Of course, if she has roused the say village already, why, then, we'll be ar- the! rested before daylight.; But if she has has not, I can catch her and bring her back a before much harm has been done; so own let us keep cool."        not But, in spite of his advice, he spoke Elle nervously and in trembling accents. let]   'her  They now held a brief consultation as to the best place to confine Norris ?ru- and concluded that he should beput vith down in the cellar, which was unusual- ly deep, and where he would have been ery imprisoned long ago had it not been for the entreaties of Abigail, whose in- old fluence over the stony heart of her sis- th- ter had always been a riddle to Solo- di- mon. So, after replenishing the lamp, re- the door of this subterranean abode ou was opened and the victim lowered in. at to it. And there they left him, lying on a heap of potatoes, with a big- ly mouthed toad for his only companion. ly  Mr. Onderdonk now prepared to set Id ,off in pursuit of his adopted daughter; lo and as he crossed the threshold, it is not wonderful if his knees felt weak, d for it was possible that, even at this late e hour, some of the village people might n be coming towards the creek. "Don't o be scar't, man," said Prudence, slipping  her finger through his button hole, and , detaining him a moment, "I'm in the s same fix as yourself. Keep a bold face, i and all will be right. Tell the public , that there really was an escaped lunatic seen around here this evening, and that will throw 'em off the scent. And then, after we have the girl once more in our power, she won't run off a second time, I promise. If herfriendsmiss her, and wonder where she is, why tell 'em she's gone to Ohio to visit that sister of yours--eh? Isn't that a good idea?" "Capital, replied Solomon, brighten- ing up. "Yes, I'll do exactly as you say. Oh, how cute you are!" and with these words he squeezed her hand, and hastened away. The first place he went to was his own house, knowing that if Lizzie was not there she would cert lin y be with Ellen Fowler, in which case he would let her remain until morning.   When he reached home, the servant, whom he had awakened from a com- fortable nap on the sofa, informed him that his daughter had not been there. He, therefore, at once returned to mill- land, determined, although it was a very disagreeable task, to pass the night in the vicinity of Gregory's cabin, and watch, lest she and Dick might leave   before dawn for Eastchester, in order to tell their story, and then seek repose in some more distant place. He pre- ferred adopting this course, to disturb- ing the household at such an unseason. able hour, when the high-spirited lad might oppose his taking her away; and he was anxious to accomplish his pur- pose in as gentle a manner as possible.  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7736-00000048"/> CHAPTER XIII.   TIHE greater part of the forenoon after Harriet Everet's reception, was spent by her father reclining on a sofa in the-large drawing room, listen- ing to his daughter's performances on the piano. Occasionally a faint smile would light up his countenance, when the thought of Dick entered his head (for the comedy of the previous day had greatly amused him), but it was not difficult for anybody who knew the banker as well as his daughter did, to perceive that he was in one of his fits of despondency. And the young lady's face, usually bright and cheerful, be- came distirbed as she occasionally turned and fixed her eyes upon him,. Suddenly leaving the piano, and throw- ing herself on her lnees, "Oh, father," she exclaimed, "do promise that you will leave the city and retire with me ; to some fine  country home. Wall ( street is killing you. How can I be  happy unless you are? I have already ( said that I did not care  any more t for balls and parties. I have had enough of them the past winter. Yes, E father, do promise not to go any more 1 to that wretched office."     a "But what would become of your prospects in life, my child, if I buried c you with me in the woods? Most young s ladies are anxious to marry, and marry s well. Here you have plenty of beaux c to choose from, but to move out among h the rocks and clover-fields! why, the a world would consider me insane." fi 4"Let the world think what it pleases. 'l We'd have birds, and flowers, and the it   n balmy air to soothe you, and I am sure i, I could get along very well without a Mrs. Merryweather." i- "Why, does she fancy that she is im- n portant to us?" e  "She never has expressed herself to n that effect, but then she spends the d greater part of the day here when you d are down town, annoying me with her t gossips. There was a -time when I e thought her original, and entertaining, but I am tired at last of her nonsense. s If I were to believe half of what she s says, I'd become a perfect fool. She - considers everybody who is not worth ' at least half a million a common, vul-  gar creature, and she declares that in a few years she will create an aristocracy in New York to be composed only of the wealthiest members of society ; and none will be admitted to the " charmed circle" who do not have some heraldic device emblazoned on their carriage doors, and their servants clad from head to foot in lace and velvet." "Capital, capital!" exclaimed the banker, laughing, and rubbing his hands. "But, tell me, has she said anything to you yet about Dick?" "Indeed she has; and for a wonder, considering how difficult she is to please, she pronounced him extremely hand- some. She declares, moreover, that he ' could hardly lift his eyes from that huge cross which is forever dangling about her neck, and attributes his un- fortunate fall to the supposition that his thoughts were entirely engrossed with it. She told me  also that he seemed   greatly struck with- that small portrait on the mantel-piece, which you value so highly; the one of the lady whom you say, many years ago, mysteriously dis- appeared." '"Yes, poor Emma- P--   ," sighed Mr. Everet, " how well do I remember her i! and Alexander Norris, too, whom it was said she was going to marry! Why, it seems only yesterday since I spolke to him for the last time previous to his starting for Australia. At least rumor said it was to that distant region lie went, though I have never felt sat- isfied that he did go, and I have always thought there was a mystery about the whole affair." Harriet having now succeeded in re- storing a certain amount of cheerful- ness to her parent, again seated hers-elf at the piano and began singing Kath- leen Mavourneen. "Oh! how beautiful, how beatiful 1" he exclaimed when she had finished. '* But, father, Mrs. Merryweather al- ways ridicules it, and says I ought to sing none but Italian pieces." "'Bah, take my advice and stick to good old English. One hears,-alas! too few such songs as Kathleen, now-a- days. Those foreign Prima Donnas have completely turned our ladies' heads." Harriet was about to resume her singing when the servant announced James M1erryweather, Jr.,'who, like a dutiful son, had just come from the bedside of his invalid parent. It is more than likely, however, the young man would -have deferred his present visit to Harriet until a later hour, and betaken himself to the club for a game of billiards, had not his mother, while she sat at the breakfast table this morn- ing, again fool shy urged him to cross the ocean, and pass the winter and   summer in Spain, especially in Anda- lusia, where she had often heard her husband say the prettiest girls in -the world were to be found. But, although she had assured him that he might have as much pocket- money as he wished for the journey, the perverse youth replied that he would never leave America until he went on his wedding tour; and as for her say- ing that his lungs were weak, and that he needed a change of climate, why it was a great mistake; he was as sound as a dollar, and to convince her of this, he administered such hard blows upon his chest, with both fists, as greatly to alarm his tender parent. The reception of James was a cordi- - al one, at least on the part of the bank- f er, who had, of course, not failed to  notice the attention which, during the past six months, the youth had been ' paying to his daughter; and already he was looking forward to the day when - he would, in all probability, call him son-in-law. Harriet, however, was somewhat reserved in her manner to- wards him. Perhaps she thought it ! necessary to begin at once to .wean - herself fromh her city beaux, if ever she s expected to dwell contentedly in the ' country. James, however, was the best of all her admirers; but even he, she r believed, was only seeking her hand in I order to get the million which her fa- a ther was expected to leave behind him ' when he died. She knew that the s young men of New York, however g wealthy, made riches paramount to af- t fection in the selection of their wivp. d But James, we are persuaded, was an e exception to this rule, for he was sin- e cerely attached to her, and her father's i- wealth was only a secondary considera- s tion in his estimation. d  But the real cause of the change  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7736-00000049"/> which had so suddenly come over Har- riet with regard to all those who were courting her favor assiduously, was that she herself was smitten, and not with any fashionable youth either, but-with poor Dick, of mill-lane! "My daughter and I have just been speaking about rural life-of ploughing and making hay-what is your opinion of it, Mr. Merryweather?" asked the banker, as soon as their visitor had seated himself. For a moment, James twirled his moustache in silence and looked as if he were preparing to give a well-di- gested opinion on the subject. For once I in his life, he seemed endowed with a i spark of his mother's shrewdness, which 1 told him to beware of speaking rashy, since, for aught he knew, Mr. Everet ' himself might be thinking of retiring g from business and turning country gen- tleman. "Well, really sir," he answered with ii deliberation, "I can imagine one being 1; happy enough surrounded by cows, and u sheep, and poultry, provided-----"The completion of the sentence was inter- n rupted by the abrupt entrance of Mrs. sl Merryweather.           hi Her appearance gave Harriet but p: little pleasure. The banker, on the contrary, regarded her visit as most op- m portune, for he knew she disagreed with di her son. on most subjects, and he ex- pected to witness a sharp encounter be- th tween them, if the conversation turned Bi on fields and trees, and farm houses, in of which she had a perfect horror. an "Mother," said James, after the co usual salutations had passed and she at had seated herself on the sofa, "I have po hit on a plan for restoring my health, th; which I am certain you will favor, and hit which will be far more agreeable to mi myself than visiting Spain. I am, he   ar- thinking of going to Westchester coun. ere ty, and turning husbandman." hat  Mr. Everet, when he heard this, gave ith an approving nod, which did not escape ith Mrs Merryweather, whose eyes looked daggers at her son. en  "No, sir, I would rather see you ig study for the ministry, than do such a of thing as that!" she replied, shaking her )e head; " a child of mine turn clod! Oh, id what is the world coming to? Is it possible, Mr. Everet, you would advise is such a step?" if  "I fear, madam," answered the gen- i- tleman appealed to, " we may not be of e the same opinion as to such a mode of a life. It is by far the most desirable, h both for health and happiness." "Why, of course," added the youth, t "the effect will be much better than , going to Andalusia." "And father, too, has some idea of residing hereafter away from the city," "nterrupted Harriet, who could not help , laughing in her sleeve at the discomfit- ure of this proud woman. The latter, finding that she was over- ruled, suppressed her indignation by a strong effort; but the glances she gave her son were significant, and told him plainly enough what was coming. "There's thunder and lightning for me  by and by," thought he, "so I'll dine at the club to-day." Mrs. Merryweather's -conduct upon the present occasion may seem strange. But bear in mind, reader, that she was in a peculiarly morbid state of mind i and when she heard that the banker contemplated leaving New  York, she at once concluded that James had pro- posed to Harriet, been accepted, and that Mr. Everet was anxious to hide himself in some  wilderness where he might never again behold the face of her for whom he was pining.   "Yes, he has given me up l' she sighed. "Oh, why does my husband linger so long on the brink of the grave!" But there was 1" no use crying over spilt milk," so she determined at once to go home, and in the solitude of her own chamber work out a plan for her future guidance. So, rising, she made her exit, bowing rather stiffly, and wear- ing a countenance Hbich spoke vol- umes, at least so fancied her son, who thanked Providence that he had such   a place of refuge as the New York club, where he might take shelter from her wrath. Nor did he remain very long after the departure of his parent, for Harriet declined taking a drive with him that afternoon, and likewis. assured him that she preferred not at-. tending the opera in the evening. This -unexpected coolness on her part, how- ever, he attributed to a desire not to leave Mr. Everet alone, who, he knew, was in delicate health, and not to any change in her feelings towards himself.  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7736-00000050"/> CHAPTER XIV   JNAT  GREGORY, it will be re- membered, was left tramping along the road to Yonker's with his show- cart. His brief interview with Mr. On- derdonk had had the effect of render- ing him, if not less jolly, at any rate more than ever alive to the importance of working hard for an independence; and even his wonted grin had now some- thing determined about- it. "If Prudence and Solomon," he solil- oquized, " should pursue me, what had I better do?" To flee and abandon his precious collection of birds and animals, would be bad enough, but the trouble which might be brought upon those who re- ' mained in the cabin by these two cioss- grained individuals-should he allow i himself to be arrested-would be still T worse.              s The sun at this hour was scorching, E and as he journeyed along in the midst C of a cloud of dust, the country folks 1 whom he passed stared at him with h compassion from the doors of the farm- houses, and from the fields where they h were at work. "Poor fellow!" they said, "pity but he had a horse to haul that 'ere ma- chine for him." At one place where he tarried a mo- w ment to' get a drink, a bevy of children, s; with several women, crowded around go him and asked a thousand questions about the outlandish critter chained to ca the pole. Hle answered them all good th naturedly, and then in turn inquired s (   e- whether they wished to purchase some g of his curiosities. v But, although he was induced to take t- out every bird, and animal, and give, r- besides, a long account of how "Tom- e my" had been captured in Brazil, they e declared he put too high a price upoa ; his stock; and finally, as a compromise, - offered him three dozen cabbages for his entire stock in trade. Disgusted--as well he might be-at such meanness, he resumed his way, hoping that in Yonker's he would find people more liberal. "But if folks are as miserly else- where," he soliloquized, " what shall I do?" And again he set his wits to work. He was able to write a fair hand, and might procure a situation as clerk, somewhere; but then he had already given up a place of this sort in East- chester, several years before, that mode of life proving too inactive for him. He might turn schoolmaster, but when he thought of the cadaverous counte- nances which all the pedagogues whom he had ever known wore, he shook his head, disapprovingly, for if there was one thing he disliked more than anoth- er, it was scanty fare. Farming might please Ellen-and, for her sake, what was he (not willing to do? "But," he said, " that's the last thing a person of genius should attempt." And thus, as he marched along, oc- casionally glancing up at the blue sky, then at the Palisades beyond the Hud- sonl, which were now visible, he called   in review &amp;very occupation by which he t1 might acquire wealth, but none seemed g to suit his fancy. At length, when he was within half c a mile or so of his destination, he sud- ii denly dropped the pole-gave his   s knuckles a violent cracking-then turn- r ing his pockets inside out and tossing b his cap into the air, began to skip and c laugh, and in fact act so queerly that c anybody who had seen him might have i fancied him demented.       n "Yes," he cried, " it's a stroke of in- C spiration, sure I and whether I get rid of my stock or not, I'll try it-I will s -I will!"             1 What this bright idea was, which had so suddenly entered his brain, will be i disclosed further on in the narrative. a For the present let us follow him as he again advances, but more slowly than before, grinning and talking to him- self, and seemingly indifferent as to whether the old maid and Solomon came after him or not. Although it was nearly dusk when he entered Yonker's, only a few moments were required to collect a crowd of boys around the cart, 'and it is possible he might have exhib- ited his collection with some profit had it not been so late. As it was, he pre- ferred going straight to the Knicker- bocker tavern, a resting place which had been recommended to him by a -ped- dler as' being 'decidely a well-kept house." What he saw of it, as he approached, certainly pleased him. He liked the clean red brick, the old fashioned dor- mer windows, the view of the Hudson which ran only a short distance from the door; but, what was better than all, was the absence of any loungers in front it. The landlord he found to be a re- markably taciturn individual, who sig- nified his yeas and nays by motions of   the head, a mode which was highly gratifying to Nat, as it saved time. In less than five minutes the show cart and "Tommy" were safely housed in a small stable close by, and he him- self following the man up to his bed- room. This was clean, yet exceedingly bare; no wash-stand, no pitcher, no chair, not even a peg to hang his clothes on; nothing, in fact, was to be seen in the apartment except a thin straw mattress on a shaky bedstead, and, un- derneath the latter, a rat trap. "I'll sleep here, tip-top," he thought, surveying his dormitory, " and this chap knows how to make money.   Who wants fOblish luxuries? And I guess, from the looks of things, the charges are moderate." "When the bell rings, it means sup- per," whispered the landlord, now open- ing his lips for the first time. "You'll find water, comb and towel down in the bar-room," and as he uttered the last word he vanished, leaving our friend wondering what the -price of lodging might be at the Knickerbocker. "( I think I could keep a hotel my- -self," he soliloquized, " but I'll try the other scheme first, for that was inspira- - tion, sure." In a few moments a cracked tea-bell i was heard, and although the sounds it  vented would not have been consider- ted very melodious by those who have heard the performances of the Swiss , bell-ringers, yet it had a decidedly a agreeable sound to Gregory, for reasons - easily conjectured by the reader. l  He did not stop to arrange his hair a or wash his face, but bounced into the , eating-room, to the amazement of the t landlady, who sat at the head of the - table with a dish of ham aad eggs in - front of her. It is no wonder she stared, f for verily the taxidermist locked a per-  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7736-00000051"/> feet scare-crow. His crown barely con- cealed by the bristles, and every tooth in his mouth rendered visible by his peculiar grimace; and then, too, how could she help frowning when she, saw with what gusto he appropriated the good cheer before him? Not content with sipping his tea, as did the other boarders--of whom there were three present-he gulped it down as though it were an unpleasant draught, then handed back his cup to be refilled. "I'll get the worth of it out of him!" muttered the woman, barely able to re-, press her anger as she watched him eating.  "Indeed I will. I came from  Down East, too." -  She kept her word, and how she did  it shall be related in this chapter, 1 merely by way of episode, as it may, prove useful to other tavern keepers I who are troubled with voracious board- F ers. Gregory, we know, was a good-'  hearted fellow; so when his own appe- M tite was appeased he went out to the b stable, unfastened the chain from the a pole of the cart, and brought Tommy into the house, at the same time strok- l ing it on the back to prevent it becom- ei ing excited.           th The silent landlord admired the- a beast's color very much, and so did his lo wife, from whom the young man con- ec trived to obtain a little milk, which was placed in a cupboard, together with the Gi animal. The woman at first appeared le( rather reluctant to grant him this fa- sa vor, and did it only upon his assuring TI her that the catamounts of Brazil were an gentle, and that this one was, particu- do larly fond of children. He likewise in- formed her that it was for sale, and in( begged her to-tell her friends and ac- fie quaintances about it.       an Having thus discharged his duty to- wards Prudence's pet, he left the inn for r]   on- a short walk through the town. He oth soon found himself in the main street, his and as he was sauntering along, think.- ow ing of Ellen and Dick, and wishing that aw the latter were with him, his attention the was arrested by some one muttering mnt close behind him: ler "Yes, money is a curse; it is, it is!" ee and as he turned to see who it might gh be, the stranger halted to look at some. en thing in a shop window which was well lighted; and the taxidermist, who like- !" wise stopped, was able to obtain agood e-, view of the countenance and figure of m the speaker. The gentleman was tall, rn but did not carryhimself very erect, and his face was haggard. "Some preach- d er," thought Nat, " fixing up his sermon r, for next Sabbath. Humph! that's the y, pleasantest way of sweating, after all. s If everything else fails me, I can turn I- parson." Being, as usual, in a talka- 1- five mood, he resolved to have a chat - with this individual, so speaking out e boldly: "Nice evening, sir, after such v a hot day," he said. "It is, indeed," replied the stranger, - looking towards him, "and you must enjoy it; for, if I mistake not, you are the young man whom I saw a few hours ago coming into town dragging quite a load after-him. I noticed you appear- ed nearly fagged out." "Yes, I'm the very fellow," answered Gregory, "I carry in that cart a col- lection of stuffed birds and beasts for sale, also a live Brazilian catamount. This last is a particularly noble brute, and can be had, dog :cheap, for fifty dollars. Like to'buy?" "Well, I have no objectipn to exam- ine your museum,- and I  might take a few things, but certainly not that wild animal you have just mentioned." "  Humph!"  thought our friend, "  Tommy may be harder to get rid of   than all the rest." Then accosting the sa stranger again : "Well, what would you I say to forty-five dollars, sir F" c? I don't wish to purchase it."  ni "Well, thirty?"        -a "Why, you seem anxious to dispose m of the catamount!" exclaimed the other, who, as the reader has doubtless already a surlmised, was Mr. Ambrose Everet. p } The banker had arrived here only this p afternoon, accompanied by Harriet, in t] order to consult with a friend before s beginning his search for a country t home.  "I don't want to throw the animal r away," replied the taxidermist, "but, to r tell the truth, I am anxious to dispose of my stock as quickly as possible, for t I am going to change my occupation, 1 which is too slow. I'd be all my life ( making a fortune at it." "Ha, too slow! I once had exactly 1 such ideas," sighed the gentleman, plac- ing his hand on Nat's shoulder. "Tell me," be continued, "have you a good appetite?" "Tolerable, sir ; never was so full that I hadn't room for one more bite." ? (And do you sleep well " "Like a top; and when I'm in my 'roost,' even a thunder storm can't wake me. Oh, don't imagine I am dis- contented. Only I mean if I had a million I'd be ten times happier." "I think rot, my friend. That is al- together a delusion." "W Why, you are the first person I ever met who thought so." "But I know  one who, although .. worth more than a million, is still haunt- i ed by the dread of poverty." l "Whew 1 I wish you'd just tell him f to step into my boots," said Nat, grin- ning; "my cart would suit him, per- haps."      ( "Do not laughl" replied Mr. Everet,   sadly; "I am that'person. For years I tried to get rich--I am, able to pro- cure everything I wish, and yet my nights are restless, my days miserable, and I am about to leave my splendid mansion in New York, to turn farmer." "Humph ! I don't doubt, sir, such a life will give you health; nothing like ploughing and driving oxen for the ap- petite; I hold that when a chap loses that, he is pretty nigh wound up. But such an occupation is too slow for my taste. I ain't afraid of how I'll feel when I'm worth a million. Just let me begin my fortune by selling you all my birds." To the no small delight of our friend, the banker at once agreed to relieve him of his whole collection, with the ex- ception of Tommy, telling him to bring them the next morning to a certain getl- r tleman's house in the suburbs, where - the money would be paid him. 1 "Unlucky cat!" muttered Nat, after i he bad thanked him cordially. "It S sticks like a leech. But, by jingo, I'll e manage somehow to get rid of it." Before separating, the rich man ask- ed where he hailed from, and when he y learned that his residence was near t Eastchester, he appeared much pleased, s- and inquired whether-he did. nor dwell a in a very small house, on what was call- ed Mill lane, and when he heard that 1- he did, the banker went on to inform him that himself and daughter had once er been there, and seen Ellen and Dick, who had entertained them so well that h they intended/soon to pay the cabin an- it- other visit. "I'm not surprised that Ellen Fowler im pleased you, sir," said the taxidermist, in- with enthusiasm, "for she's just the er- best mortal on this earth, and when we are married, I'll have one of the best et, wives in the world."  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7736-00000052"/> Mr. Everet shook his hand, and con- gratulated him on having made choice of a partner for life, though in his heart he thought it was a pity that the young woman's health was so precari- ous. "'And Dick, too, is ,a fine fellow," continued Nat. "We have been a hap- py family for six years past; and al- though occasionally it's been hard work getting enough to eat, still we've con- I trived to do it. I believe God has ( blessed us. At any rate, Ellen says so, and that is enough for me-her faith is s tmy faith."            r So touched was Mr. Everet at this a expression of devotion to the young " woman, and   the hopeful, energetic fi spirit manifested, that he pulled out his en purse and paid Gregory on the spojt for ye all he had bought; and, moreover, gave in five times as much as the price demand- h( ed; and when they bade each other al good-bye, they both felt happier than before they met. The rich man's gen- ml erosity was rewarded by a  peace of re mind unknown to him for many a  day, pe while Gregory, as he heard the gold pe clinking in his pocket, skipped along the street, exclaiming, "Now for home!" ruI As soon as he reached the Knicker- opl bocker, bhe perceived by the counte- wo nance of the taciturn landlord, that woi something had gone amiss during his suc absence. The man beckoned him to luc enter the eating-room, when presently and he commenced shaking his head and squ wringing his hands as if some great  misfortune had occurred.     bad "What ails you?" cried Nat, impa- ble tiently; is your wife sick?"     "No, that she isn't l" he replied. cont "She'll outlive me, certain."   a   ma "Well, is my show cart broken, or exar what?"              sho Then suddenly our friend gave a ran      :on- start, took a step backward as the oice thought struck, him that perhaps Solo- his mon and Prudence had tracked him the here, and he was all the more certain ari- this was the case when the man began pointing towards the door opposite W" which led into the kitchen, and from ap- whence there issued the sound of loud al- voices. rk  "Yes, the old maid is there i" he so- - liloquized. "Blast her confounded as cat!" so, "( Oh! you've corhe back have you!" is screamed the landlady, at this moment rushing forth, her hair in disorder and is a frightful scratch across her nose. ]g "You told me the critter was gentle and ic fond of children, eh? and that you want-. is ed somebody to buy it, eh? didn'nt )r you? Well, look here, and here 1" lay- e ing her finger on her face and neck, I- her voice rising to a pitch of consider- r able altitude. n  Her husband, as soon as she com- - menced her tirade, placed himself in the f rear of Gregory, and was n6w timidly , peering at his " better-half," like a wood- i pecker from behind a tree. Nat, at first, was tempted to inter- rupt and explain, but she gave him no opportunity; her rage drowned his words, and he soon perceived that it would be folly to attempt to set sail in such a tornado, and that he would be luckly, indeed, if he could only 'lay to' and escape with nothing worse than a squall. "Women's tongues, when they are bad, are awful!" he said, making a fee- ble attempt to grin. "Well, when my cousin, Mary Ann," continued the landlady, after stopping a   moment to breathe, "came over to examine your outlandish beast, what should it do but fly at her, and when I ran to pull it away, for it was tearing   her eyes out, it turned upon me as  S though it would tear me to pieces. But he if it had stopped after drawing blood it and wouldn't have been so bad, but it corm- fror menced smashing al lmy new china, and wif( now I ain't got a cup nor a saucer to ass put on the table. However, I'll see str. that you pay the damages 'afore you sid quit this roof, I will!" "Are you through?" inquired the mo taxidermist, putting his right hand in Na his pocket and drawing out some of the she money which Mr. Everet had given gri him. "And what more do you expect me ca to say?" cried the woman.    so "*I would merely ask to be shown those broken things, ma'm, afore I pay sa for 'em, that's only business-like, you ps know." "Oh, very proper, sir ; then just fol- ye low me," and so saying, she conducted fo him into the kitchen, Where, all nicely arranged in the middle of the floor, was b: a heap of crookery, some of which had c; been destroyed fully six months before, w while the remainder she had cracked g on purpose, this very evening. There b might perhaps have been ten dollars' worth of it, at the most. Not far off, h lay a meal bag, in which Tommy was f secured.             t "Now you see for yourself what the i critter did," she resumed, with a trium- 1 phant toss of the head. "' But since you've offered so readily to settle the account, I'll be easy on you, and only demand twenty dollars, although, goodness knows, thirty wouldn't buy me a new set." ' Oh, dear 1" sighed our friend, cast- ing up in his mind'how much would re- main after the payment of this sum. "4 Its a hard loss for me I but I guess I'd better pacify her and have done with it."   So, amid the smiles of the landlady, he poured the gold out on the table; and as he did so her husband stepped from behind Nat and stared at his wife, seemingly wonder-struck at her assuming a cheerful countenance, so strange a phenomenon was that con- sidered. As soon as she had counted the money and declared herself satisfied, Nat threw the meal-bag across his shoulder, and went off to his bed-room, grinding his teeth and vowing, that if he did not succeed in getting rid of the cat, at least it never should see Hutchi- son's creek again. '. Them's the sort of guests I like 1' said the landlady, chuckling as he de- parted. "To-morrow he may eat as much ham and eggs as he pleases; -yes, and drink ninety-nine cups of tea, for what I care."  i The next morning our hero arose s bright and early; and although the i calamity of the previous day had some- , what disturbed his rest, it was soon for- 1 gotten in his reverie of home and its e beloved inmates. i' "A fellow always learns something,' F, he soliloquized, " even by such a mis- ts fortune as has happened to me here. It teaches him to be cute, and not talk ie more than necessary, for if I hadn't n- told her the cat was gentle she would probably not have touched it, and I ly would have been richer than I am now )n by twenty dollars. - Then, again, she's rs, sharp as a steel-trap, as I ought to have :ty seen at first by the tip of her nose; and I should have been on the watch for st- any tricks, for although I can't prove re- it, I am sensible I've been humbug- im. ged." ess  While these tloughts were passing one through his mind, he glanced several times towards the bag, for it puzzled  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7736-00000053"/> him to'know what was the speediest method of disposing of Tommy. At last it occured to him that he had better sell the creature at auction, a mode of getting rid of his goods which he had never yet tried, but he felt con- fident he could succeed in that line as well as any other man.  e need scarcely remark that at the breakfast table he found a great change in the landlady's appearance and de- meanor; she was as pliable as silk, t while her husband seemed to have be- r come many years younger, and really I became quite cummunicative, uttering sundry sweet phrases in praise of his r i wife, who no doubt had ceased hen-peck- t ing him, for the time being.   o Nat, as he took his seat, grinned A when he saw the long strip of court- b plaster on the woman's nose, for, it re- minded him that she- had not got the hb twenty dollars for nothing.    m "She's educated me considerable," pC he said, eyeing her askance, "yes, wher- ca ever a chap travels he can always learn ca something.  Oh Dick, Dickl I wish an you were here 1"         k When, at last, he started off from the an "Knickerbocker," and  shaped  his the course for the house where the banker cor had told him to leave his collection, he be; was overflowing with happiness; and, ohb as he was a  brisk walker, and, more- over, had not far to go, he soon reached cro the spot.            - fina Although it was not yet eight o'clock, ter I the servant maid who opened the door mal informed him that Mr. Everet and his glisl daughter had already returned to the all i city, but that the former had given di- for I rections to have whatever was brought, Solo kept for him till he should write where late, to have it sent.         woul Gregory regretted this very much, bocd for he wanted to thank the rich man lar.   diest again for his generosity, and also to make one last effort to sell him. the cat. shad  It did not take him long to empty %n, a the show-cart of its contents; and when hich he had ranged the birds and animals all con- in a row in the hall, and saw the chil. e as dren and their parents come and admire them, he was exceedingly proud, and the felt convinced that, before many years, "nge the public would seek his autographs. de- . Having retraced his steps towards silk, the town, he soon found himself in the be- main street, where he halted and pre- Illy pared to try his skill at auctioneering. ing  The first thing he did was to loosen his Tommy, and then mount to the top of ck- -the cart with the beast, firmly planting one of his feet on the end of the chain. led After which, throwing down his cap, he lrt- began to cry out : re-  "Hear ye I hear ye! come and be- he hold this truly wonderful Brazilian cata- mount I  First of its species ever im- ," ported into the United States. No rats :r- can exist within a mile of him! will rn catch minks and weazles, and would be ;h an invaluable creature on a farm-easy keeper-drinks milk only occasionally, le and would make a capital cross with is the domestic cat! Oh! one and all, :r come and behold this extraordinary e beast! For sale at your own price; [, oh, come and see-!" While he was thus screaming, the 1 crowd kept constantly increasing until finally it would have been no easy mat- , ter for him to get down off his stand and make his way through it. His eyes were glistening with excitement, his mouth all in a grin, and his heart throbbing, for he knew that unless Prudence and Solomon came quickly, it would be too late, as in a few moments the crisis would be over and the cat. sold to some- body, even if it only brought one dol, lar.   "Gentlemen!" he presently'resumed, o "what's bid for this wonderful animal?" e A momentary pause followed this question: everybody seemed afraid to I make the first offer. "Fifty cents!" at p length called out a voice.     s cFifty cents, fifty cents!'" repeated a the taxidermist, in a slightly indignant f tone; "why, his chain is worth more r than that. "Fifty cents, fifty cents." X "One dollar!"' exclaimed another. h "One dollar, one dollar 1" cried Nat. e But just at this moment his cries 1 were drowned by a loud shout, followed by a commotion in the crowd; and a I man, covered with dust, and looking as  if he had driven a long distance, was seen pushing towards him with aheavy whip in his hand, closely followed by a 1 tall, gaunt female. "Solomon and Prudence, as I live!" gasped the auctioneer, almost sinking on his knees, so completely was he un- nerved by the appearance. It was now Tommy's turn to grin; and no sooner did the creature spy its mistress, than, giving a terrific yell, it sprang into the air, and passing over the heads of half a dozen of the gaping spectators, landed safely on her shoul- der. "Arrest this fellow! arrest him! he's a thief-an imposter 1!" cried Mr. Onderdonk, seizing Nat's left leg. Fortunately, the latter quickly recov- ered from his bewilderment, and glanc- ing rapidly round, like a General sur- veying the field of battle, he resolved, if he could not escape, at least to die game. The man's hold upon him was a very firm one, and it would have been diffi- clt to free himself from it, had not the bystanders, in their excitement, pushed Solomon so hard against the side of the cart that he was forced to let go, in   order to save himself from being squeez- ed to death. Our hero took advantage of this to bring down his right fist upon his op- ponent's forehead with a thump which sent him r eling back into the old maid'a arms, causing her pet to give another frightful howl. But quickly the widower returned to the charge, and with his whip began lashing Gregory over the hips with all his might, while the woman clapped her hands and encouraged him by her voice. The sympathies of the spectators ap- peared to be about equally divided; one youth declaring that he did not care which whipped, so long as he could see a good fight; while another bawled. out " hurrah for the auctioneer! pitch. in, mister l" and a third exclaimed "LI bet on the horse that wins!" Amidst this uproar the combat be., came warm, nay, even furious. Thei, distiller's weapon lascerated Nat's legs. and made him hop about like a danc- ing bear; while every few seconds the young man's fists left ugly marks on his. adversary's nose and eyes. At length, Mr. Onderdonk brought the butt of his. whip into play and inflicted'such a vio- lent blow on our friend's knee that he. staggered and uttered a cry of pain ; but in an instant Gregory's foot was drawn back, and with tremendous force. sent plump against the widower's stom-  ach, and his opponent dropped as-if he had been shot. "Oh, he's killed!" shrieked, Miss  Mather. "( He's killed!" echoed a number of, ; others ; and the victor, horrified beyond. - measure at the thought that he had e caused Solomon's death, turned round,. i and, giving a long jump, bounded safely e into the street, and then ran off as fast as, a his legs could catry him.  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7736-00000054"/> CHAPTER XV.'   SULLEN    as Mr. Onderdonk always was, never had he appeared so dis- agreeable to everybody who approach- ed him, as he did the first day or two after his return from Yonker's. And can we wonder at it, when every part of his body was aching from the blows received in the remarkable encounter related in the preceding chapter? Had Gregory's kick been only a lit- tle harder, it might really have caused his death; but, as it was, it had requir- ed several hours of repose in a drug- store, whither he was carried by the old maid and some of the bystanders im- mediately after the battle, before he was able to sit up and converse. And while his senses were gradually returning, he amazed Prudence by smacking his lip's and calling out for - "old rye." Lizzie had been discovered, as he I rightly conjectured she would be, in r the cabin on Mill-lane, quietly taking b breakfast with Ellen and Dick. Of n course, he ,at once brought her away, h but in doing so had used no harsh lan- g guage, for the carrying out of his future so ,plans required that he should appear w more gentle towards her.      N He   had, however, informed the lad s( and young woman that their stay on his fo acre of land would be of short dura- he ticn ;  adding, with a sinister smile, that w ;the stolen cat had been found.  wi What Dick's feelings were, when he in heard this, may more easily be imagin- m led than described. At onice his vivid sp imagination had commenced conjuring ho   ys up all sorts of evils for Nat; while El. is- len, who knew nothing about the old h- maid's pet, did not understand what he Vo meant, and her ignorance of the truth id made her feel even worse than she rt would were she in possession of all the vs facts of the case. er  As for Lizzie, when she found her, self alone with her father, she seemed t- heart-broken, and her. rabbit nestled d closely at her side, as though it knew r- she was in grief and wanted to sympa- :- thise with her. d  And while she sat mute and colorless i- on the sofa in the parlor, the widower, e who was pacing up and down the room, kept muttering to himself, every now y and then glancing angrily towards her. V  That she never had loved the man, r was natural enough.  As far back as she could remember, he had always been cross to her, and the brutal man- ner in which he had treated his wife, had left a  lasting impression on her tmind. Now, however, she not only hated him, but, what is more, was be- ginning to dread   him. Something seemed to admonish her that he and the witch (for such she believed Prudence Mather to be), were bent on doing her some injury. It is not strange, there- fore, that on this second morning after her escape from the stone house, and while she was thus sitting in the room with him, obliged to endure his wither- ing gaze, she began revolving in her mind various plans of escape from this spot, which had never been a happy home to her.   Little did she dream that money lay ri at the bottom of the systematic perse-, m cution to which Solomon had subjected lher ever since Mrs. Onderdonk's death. fu Better a thousand times had that b( poor woman, instead of remembering 01 her in her will, bequeathed all the land U] she possessed in Eastchester to her S husband, for then that fiendish scheme r' which he had so long secretly cherish- ed, and which, as we know, the elder Y of the old maids had at length induced s him to commence putting into execu- e tion, might never have found lodgment s in his mind. "Oh! I can see the resemblance now ; strange that I never did before 1" said the widower, eyeing her sternly, *" and that will be one more reason for putting her out of the way. Yes, father 1 and child must go together. In spite of Abigail, there must be a clean job made of it! No dark room--no cellar i -no! I want 'em both down at the bottom of the mill-pond 1" Lizzie had been expecting, every moment since her return, to be sent back to the lonely dwelling by the creek; imagine, therefore, her surprise when the widower suddenly ceased pacing up and down the floor, and in a voice devoid of all harshness, said; "My daughter, since you find the company of the Miss Mathers unpleas- ant, I have determined not to send you there again. I shall have your carpet- bag brought back this afternoon, and to-morrow you may start off for Ohio to visit your aunt Phoebe, who lives on a fine farm and has plenty of boys and girls whom you will find good compan- ions. Yes, you may go there and Istay as long as you please, for I see you need a change of air. In the mean- time, however, and until the hour art-   rives, you will do me the favor to re- main up in your bed-room." After such an unlooked for and joy- ful announcement Almost too good to be true, these last words gave her little or no pain, and she immediately went up stairs, followed by her rabbit, while Solomon smiled grimly to think how readily she had believed him. "Oh! if Dick could only go with me!" she said to herself. "Yes, why should not he and Ellen and Gregory emigrate to that Western State? I'm sure if they were there, and I am al- lowed'to stay as long as I please, East- chester will never see me again!" When Mr. Onderdonk found himself alone, he walked up to a mirror which hung on a wall opposite the door-way, and began examining the different bruises which the fists of the taxider- mist had left on his face. The one un- ) der his left eye was particularly pain- r ful; and the flesh, although more than twenty-four hours had elapsed since the conflict, was still black and swollen. Y Nevertheless, it, as well as the other t marks, were beginning to diminish, and e he resolved no longer to keep himself e at home concealed from the eyes of the d public, for it was very important to a learn if anything had been said about a crazy man being seen near H-utchi- ie son's creek. He dreaded Dick's tongue s- and the exaggerated coloring which the )u lad might give to the scene he had wit- :t- nessed; "and they might begin again," id he said, as he put on his hat, "to talk to as they once did about Alexander Nor- a ris's sudden disappearance. It took ad all Harvey's shrewdness and mine to n- throw 'em off the scent then-'twould nd be harder work doing it now, for Abi- ou gail cannot be trusted. Oh! Abbe, in- Abbe!"And he knit his brows as he art- muttered her name. Then, having call-  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7736-00000055"/> ed out to Lizzie, and repeated the order he had given about not leaving her apartment, he started off and directed his steps towards trhe tavern, for he felt sure he would there learn all the gos- sip of the neighborhood. As the sounds of his footsteps died away, the face of his daughter resumed 6 its former happy expression, and. she  commenced to sing, while her pet frisk- ed around her, and again she thought what a glorious thing it would be if Gregory, Ellen and Dick would only follow her to Ohio. It may be asked whether she knew what the late Mrs. -Onderdonk had left  her in her will. No, she did not; and i yet she had a vague notion that she I was not to be altogether penniless and I dependent on Solomon for support, af-  ter she should become of age; for on her  dying bed his wife had beckoned her t to approach, and whispered in her ear F that she had been provided for. But h she was ignorant of the fact that the k land on which stood this large mansion, c was rightfully hers.        c Her trunk being yet at the old maids', she thought that she could not make ir better use of her time than in writing ei notes to her friends, informing them of a] her expected journey.  Aceordingly, fr she seated herself at a small table, and, a was soon hard at work with pen and e( ink. To one with whom she was es- pecially intimate, she confided a few ti] brief lines to Dick. At intervals, while he thus employed, she would turn towards nc the window, look out at the blue sky, sh and then draw a long breath, as if to inj inhale as much as possible of the deli- th cious air. The meadows, the singing he of the birds, and the trees, seemed nev- hit er so sweet as now-her heart so light, wt herspirits buoyant-and all caused by a little apparent kindness on the part of sli   er "Grumpy Solomon.' O0 cross-grained er man! why have you not smiled oftener !d on this black-eyed maiden? -W hen, at It length, her letters were finished, she s- drew her chair closer to the windor,; and with her elbow resting on the sill, d she began thinking of the youth who d , had so often rambled with her through e'the woods and along the lanes, and c- whom she loved better than any other It being on earth. Yes, she would indeed f have been willing to pass months under y Prudence's care, if at last she might b- allowed to depart with Dick to the Vest. r While she was thus musing, she sud. t denly beheld on the farther side of the I meadow opposite, two figures; the)y : were coming towards her fromn the di- I rection of Gregory's cabin, and she fan cied she could distinguish the lad and a young-woman, and it at once occurred to her that it might be Dick and Ellen, perhaps already turned out of their humble abode. She waved her hand- kerchief to them as a signal, but they could not have noticed it, for thero came no response. If it were Dick, he was evidently too much occupied in gathering wild flow- ers, for which he had a passion, to look ahead of him, for she could see that he frequently stooped, probably to pick up a violet or a dandelion, which he hand- ed to his companion. Slowly they were drawing nearer, un- til at last she recognized him; but to her great surprise the other person was not Ellen Fowler. Who, then, might she be? And as Lizzie continued watch- ing, her curiosity increased. Presently, the lad stopped and pointed towards her, and then his companion handed hima very small white handkerchief, which he began to wave. "She's not from these parts, whoever she is, said Lizzie; "nobody around   here dresses so elegantly. It wouldn't' prc do to hunt birds' nests in such floun- Iher ces."               at But no feeling of jealousy entered vill her breast, as she gazed on them, al-:1 wh thoutgh the new cloth suit which the inc lad wore, and which had already attract- an ed her attention the last time she met do him, did certainly increase her desire pa to know who the strange female might + wl be. "Was it not just possible," she be soliloquized, " that Nat, who sometimes pe visited New York, had made the ac- w quaintance of some wealthy family which had come to his assistance in this D his hour of need? In fact, might not that indefatigable genius have all along sl possessed some rich:friends? Otherwise fa it was not easy to account for the punc- st tuality with which he had paid his rent cr io her father and kept himself so clear hi of debt.              en In another moment, Dick and the It ttrahger were close to-the fence which ran only a short distance from the house, a and she determined to throw out to him t the note which she had written, inform- v ing him of her promised visit to the v West. Just as she was holding up the paper I so as to let him see it as it fell, the youn. lady also raised her hand and I smiled, and lo! there dangled from be-  tween her fingers something ' which looked very much like a blue ribbon. I  "I do believe it's the one I lost some- d time ago!" exclaimed Lizzie, her eyes riow flashing for the first time. "Yes, Dick has found it iin mill-lane, where I  am certain I dropped it the morningj Prudence Mather drove me to her home, for I recollect missing it as soon as I arrived." And as she watched Harriet, she felt strongly tempted to break her father's command and rush out and claim her   property. Suddenly, however, she saw her friend point in an excited manner at some object in the direction of the village, and not being able to discern who it was from this side of the build- ing, she hastened to another window, and there, in full view, was Mr. Onder- donk, striking the stones out of his path with his cane, as he always did when he felt angry; and well mightihe be irritated, for the saucy boys were peering at him from behind :the stone- wall, and calling him all sorts of names. To her dismay, Lizzie now heard Dick's shrill voice scream out: "Hi, ho, Grumpy Solomon!"And she trembled, for she knew that if her father saw the lad he would certainly suspect him of having some communi- L cation with herself, and thus increase r his ill humor. "'And, alas 1" she sigh- ed, " he may change his mind and not let me go to Ohio." Then, hastening back to her own apartment, she gave one last look at f the youth and Harriet, who were now - walking back across the field, after e which she closed her window, and then folding her arms waited her foster- ;r parent's approach. e  Presently his ponderous feet were d heard mounting the stoop, .and she en- e- deavored to calm herself and appear ;h happy. He did not, however, come up stairs immediately, but remained for e- full half an hour below, enjoying his es bottle of old rye, which, by the way, s, was the only th'"g gthat ever brought I any color to his usually bloodless ng cheeks. But when he did ascend, the er i staircase creaked and groaned beneath on his weight, and her heart throbbed as she listened. elt "Yes, we must make a clean job of ,r's it," he muttered, just as he reached her the top. ' Confound, Miss Abigail l"  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7736-00000056"/> And staggering through the door-way, his eyes glared like those of a wild beast. "What are those things!" he ex- claimed, pointing towards the notes  lying on the table. "Bring them here!" She obeyed and handed them to him, one by one. He was hardly sober enough to read; nevertheless, was still able to under- stand that they were written to inform i her village acquaintances of her ap- ( preaching departure from Eastchester l -and as this was merely anticipating what he himself had intended doing, he a of course nodded approvingly. It was not until he came 4to a half d sheet of paper which was folded into ii quite a small compass, and rather crim- w pled, that his lips parted and he burst sI into a derisive laugh. "Ha! :my dear Dick,'indeed; quite g, loving-ha, ha!" he said, then looking at maliciously at her, "your dear youth," m he said, will have a hard time of it, be- th fore long. 'Twill be all the better for him, though, in the end, for he has never dc yet known what it is to work; Hereaf- jo3 ter he will have to put his own shoulder so to the wheel, as Nat Gregory, who sup- me ported him, is in jail, or soon will be. po The constables are on his track." the Then reading on, he came to where an( she urged the lad to emigrate, and iml again he laughed; "Hal you'd likeido]   ay, him to follow you, eh? well, we'll see ;', ild and as he spoke, he bundled the notes together and stuffed them into his coat x- pocket, assuring her they would be sont es to their destination that very day. 1"  Now, he really meant to keep his n, word, simply erasing with his pen-knife the address of the aunt whom Lizzie 1; expected topvisit. Presently he entered r- his own chamber, which was just opI o- n site his daughter's; then he stooped )- down, and with his eye to the key-hole, r began watching her. g  "There come   the tears," he said, a-nd all on account of that young scaimp, whom she thinks more of than she ever f did of me; confound my wife for adopt- ) ing her, and then, tob, for making such a - will; itgwas the only piece of business tshe ever dared transact without miy con- sent; and curse that faint-hearted Abi- gail for letting the crazy man escape and lay eyes on his child. But, never mind, it will soon be over with both of them." Presently, Lizzie pushed her own door to, so that he, could no longer en- joy the sight of her grief; but he con- soled himself by sitting down and com- mencing the task of altering certain portions of her letters, here erasing, there adding a few words of his own; and considering the whiskey he had imbibed, the work was quite skilfully done.   CHAPTER XVI.   IT was July when Mr. Everet and his' litt daughter paid their third visit to ret the cabin.             o The second, as we know, was on the the day when Lizzie sat in her window co watching Dick and Harriet strolling the through the fields together. On that or( occasion the banker himself had spent th the greater part of the time driving ha about the neighborhood, enquiring the a value of land, and trying to find a of couple of farms which would suit him, as he had a particular reason for not th being satisfied with only one. He had ov been much disappointed in not finding fe Nat at home; and when the lad, draw- w incg him aside, whispered to him the co fears he entertained for the young man's a safety, his disappointment gave way to e sorrow-not alone on account of the h taxidermist himself, -but because he M knew what a loss Gregory would prove to Ellen, whose protector he was. t It may be wondered why Solomon t Onderdonk had permitted this once t happy family to remain so long on his 1 acre of ground, instead of turning them off, as he had promised the old maid he would. Well, reader, it was entirely owing to Greg;ory's forethought, he having paid the whole quarter's rent in advance, before starting off on his expedition, thus providing against the possibility of Ellen and Dick being disturbed duringr his absence, which he believed would not be extended beyond a month, or six wtreks at most. That morning, When he bade therh good-bye, he had   little dreamt how soon they would have reason to be thankful for what he had done. As we may naturally suppose, the rich man and his daughter had be- come more and more interested in these indigent people; and ,it was in order that they might be near to them that the two places which the banker had just purchased were not more than a mile apart, though on different sides. of the village. On this their third visit, however, the marked changed which had come Iover the young woman caused them to * feel. alarmed. Her anxiety for Nat, - which, as days and weeks flew by, be- 6 came greater, was not shown in tears s and lamentations, but, as Dick express- ed it, "she sits by the hour staring at e his desk and clock and hardly speaks a e word." e  Her sight, moreover, was almost gone, and a constant hacking cough-- n the too certain harbinger of consumnp- :e tion-had begun. Even the lad ap- is peared different; not so ready to take m Harriet through the woods, and mead- id ows as he had been the first and second time they met; and when the name of to Lizzie was mentioned, he turned away id to hide his tears. Bet, It was plain to the rich man's daugh- mn, ter that all her diamonds and bracelets. ity had not succeeded in shaking his de- ed votion to her rival; and yet, although red it wounded her pride, she could not. th, help admiring him all the mote for it. ng,  In the garden Dick had lab3r:ed in- -ad dustriously, albeit there was gei.: "ly  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7736-00000057"/> a book lying on the ground near him. The path to the little gate was kept neatly sanded; and more than once, when the cross old maid had driven past, she had found him sweeping and doing what was properly Ellen's work. It had caused him some astonish- ment thatJ Lizzie, who had written to several of the village girls informing them that she was going away to a dis- tant State, should not have favored him with a single line. And when he had inquired how he ought to address a let- ter to her, he found that she had not specified to anybody exactly where the aunt lived whom she was about to visit. 1 "Father has something for you," said r Harriet, placing herself upon a bench ' beside the young woman, "' which will help make you happy again. He will 1 do his best to discover what has become i -of Mr. Gregory; and, moreover, we in- L tend to settle down as plain country people, not far from here, and-- "She c vas on the point of adding that her s parent would afford them the means -)f living much more comfortably than s heretofore, but checked herself, for she th :felt that it would not be in good taste b Jo make any boast of what his wealth A ,might accomplish.       - h While she was telling Ellen this, cc Dick stood;.in front of her dressed in of -the same suit which he had brought I away with him from her reception, and er 'which Mr. Everet had kindly requested S :him to retain. But they were sadly worn, for he possessed no other clothes; de and the shoes, which were almost new sh ,.when he first put them  on, were hi: hardly recognizable, no blacking brush having touched them since they left St. the John's Square; and one was already so ,breaking out at the toes. While he ha :stood thus with folded arms and eyes de iastened on the ground, apparently not fee   n. listening 'to what was said, Harriet pt thought she had never seen h!m look so e, handsome before; but alas, it was evi- n1 dent his heart was far away. At length id Ellen asked him to procure a bunch of k. honey-suckles, which grew only a short h- distance from the house; and as he to started to go Harriet determined to ac- g company him: "- "For who knows," she thought (" but n the green woods may unseal his d lips, and make his eyes sparkle again. t- When he saw me first he was so differ- t ent 1" e  "Are you not glad," .she asked when  they found themselves threading the I narrow way between the cedar trees, h " that we are to live near Eastchester?" l  "Yes, very!" answered Dick; -, El- 1 len needs-friends, and I am sure noth- \ ing, except Gregory's return, would give - her more pleasure." "And I will learn all about milking cows, and raising chickens and turkeys," she continued. "Sister could teach you all that, if she only had her eyesight," responded the youth. "But your settling here will be a very happy thing for me, too." And ashe said this, the young lady's heart beat quicker. "Because," he continued, "I shall then be free to go off and search for Lizzie. Yes, I vow I will findher! I know I am only sev- enteen, yet I will prove a match for Solomon Onderdonk 1" These words fell on her ears like a death-knell, taking away the last hope she had too fondly indulged of winning his love. "And does Lizzie really resemble that portrait which I hear you admired so much the day you visited us?  I have brought it with me--look!" en- deavoring, as she spoke, to conceal her feelings,  f    Dick turned eagerly towards her, and seized the miniature which she held out to him; "Ohj yes, very  and often have I thought of it since 1 She is not really Mr. Onderdonk's daughter, and can't tell who her parents were. Who knows but----" "Hush, not so loud," said Harriet; "see, there are/ persons yonder who may be listening." Her companion raised his eyes, and lo I who should he behold seated un- der the hickory tree by the spring, but Solomon and Prudence, the former with a scowl on his face, as though an- noyed at beinc discovered; while the countenance of the latter wore a wild expression, and any one might have sworn she had been plotting mischief. "The fiends!" whispered Dick, pull- ing his friend's sleeve. "Let us go back; I can get the honeysuckles some other time." So, with scarcely another word, they retraced their steps. Just before reaching the cabin, however, he stopped, and, with a look of awe de- picted on his counterrnance, said : ( That woman was Prudence Mather, who lives with her sister Abigail, by thle creek at the end of our lane; and do you know, I believe her house is the abode of evil spirits? I do, indeed!" At such an idea, Harriet of course smiled, and almost fancied his brain had become affected at .the loss of Lizzie.   "Oh, I see you are like everybody else!" he exclaimed, reproachfully; you laugh at me for being superstitious. But doesn't Scripture tell about ghosts and witches; and are there no such things now-a-days?" To this Harriet made no reply, for she belonoed to that numerous class of Christians whose faith is bounded by what they can see and feel; and who consider not a few of the events recorded in the Bible as only so many nursery tales. Shortly after rejoining Mr. Everet and Ellen, the former pro- posed that they should leave for the city, although they had only spent an hour at the cabin. The shortness of the visit may be accounted for from the fact that he wished to make calls at the two farms which he had purchased in the neighborhood. So, bidding the young woman and the lad good-bye, and promising that ere long he would see them again, the banker and his daughter entered their barouche, and were on the point of leaving, when the former made a sighn to Dick to approach nearer, and placing in his hand a large envelope, requested him to read the pa- per enclosed to Ellen, and then take good care of it. 'Ihis, of course, Dick promised to do; and as they drove off, Harriet thought she had not seen such a happy expression on her parent's face. for many a long day.  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7736-00000058"/> CHAPTER XVI L   SEVERAL weeks had now elapsed, and the end of the quarter, for which Nat had paid Mr. Onderdonk in ad- vance, was drawing to a close ; and still there came no news of the young man; while the vague hints and the ominous sh akes of the head, to which Prudence treated Dick and Ellen every time she saw them, tended greatly to increase their anxiety. Were he anywhere in the land of the living, it seemed as if he ought surely to write; and Dick half suspected the village postmaster of being in league with Solomon, who no doubt was wicked enough to intercept any letter which 'Gregory might send. One evening Dick and Ellen were seated in the cabin, both too much oc- cupied with their own thoughts, to speak. The former was. holding in his hand the last book which Lizzie had lent . him, and his eyes fixed upon her name N written on the fly leaf. She, too, had not yet been heard from; and there X were moments when he ground his s teeth and made resolves which boded n no good to the girl's foster-father. l Harriet, who  had really settled t ,down on one of the farms purchased c by her father, and become as much h like a country maiden as one could ex- e pect, under the circumstances, had just c visited the cabin and left her favorite several books to read. She had, more- s over, during her visit, sung a number of n Italian airs; and in fact exerted her- r self to the utmost to cheer the drooping A spirits of the inmates, but unavailingly.   I "God grant he may soon return!', t ejaculated Ellen, thus breaking the long - silence. "Yes, sister," responded Dick, "Mr. Everet's generous act will fill his heart with joy ; for he will not have to toil so hard; and if he arrives before the first of next month, we will all move into the new house together. I'll persuade him to hire a farm wagon, and we'll each of us have a fish horn, and blow. it into Grumpy Solomon's ears as we pass. And if Lizzie could only be with us, how perfectly happy I'd 'be! I'll never lose sight of her again, if I get her back; no, never! I'm certain she didn't go off of her own accord." Ellen smiled at the idea of the simple youth fancying himself able to defy Mr. Onderdonk, and yet she could not help admiring his spirit; and, indeed, what a tame, prosaic world this would be, without a few such fellows as Dick in it! The dwelling alluded to above, and which they were soon to occupy, was situated on a fine twenty-acre lot, one mile north of Eastchester, and had been bought by the rich man expressly for the miller's daughter; and it was the deed of this property which he had handed to the lad, enclosed in the lar-ge envelope alluded to in the preceding chapter. At present the abode was undergoing some necessary repairs, some new fur niture placed in it, etc., but was to be ready for their reception by the first of August. "And there's a bran new desk in one   of the rooms," said Dick, " a splendid clock, and a looking-glass big enough to see my whole figure in; besides a small library; and, in fact, from what I saw when Miss Everet took me there yesterday, I think Grumpy's house, though it may be larger, won't be as fine."  Hark!" cried Ellen, suddenly in- terrupting him and raising her hands, while a gleam of joy lighted up her-pale face. "'Tis some one on horseback," said the lad, " perhaps Mr. Onderdonk go- ing to visit Prudence. Hang 'em both!" But the rider, whoever he was, had come to a halt in front of their gate; and Dick, quickly snuffing the candle, e took his stand near the door, so as to be prepared for friend or foe. As the re- tired distiller had a day or two before threatened to come and thrash him for calling him "Grumpy," he was appre- hensive the horseman was that individ- ual, anrid the object of his visit was to carry his-threat into execution. He had barely posted himself, however, when a knock was heard, and Ellen's heart sank within her, for she knew if it had been Gregory, he would have rushed in at once. The youth hesitatingly lifted the latch, and to his astonishment he beheld an elderly gentleman, attired in a black suit, with a white cravat, and a pair of gold spectacles; his silvery hair flowing over his shoulders. "It is the crazy man I saw at the old maids'!" cried he, stepping back out of reach of the stranger's arms, which were stretched forth as if to grasp him. "Jump out of the window, Ellen; save yourself!" exclaimed Dick, drop- ping the candle, and boldly seizing the intruder by the collar.   "Ha, ha I! You do not know me  ha, ha, ha!" roared the mysterious in- dividual. "Merciful heaven I it's Gregory!" cried the young woman; "that's his voice, and no mistake!" "H gue-guess so," answered ' Dick, gasping for breath, for Nat had now caught him in his arms and was hugging him like a bear. "It's nobody else!" said the taxider- mist, releasing Dick and then rushing towards Ellen, " and I'm glad to find this disguise so perfect, for my safety from arrest, as well as fame and fortune, depend on it." The lad now picked up the candle and remained a moment staring at him, as though he were still in doubt of his being the real genuine Nat; while the young woman, as her lover embraced her, was too much overcome by her feel- ings to speak. "But, Ellen," he con- tinued, presently holding her off a little, the better to see her countenance, "you have been ill!" ' And could I help it?" murmured Ellen, turning her almost sightless eyes towards him ; "' you staid away so long, and nobody knew what had befallen you." "Well, indeed," he resumed, "'twas a narrow escape from hanging or states- prison; yes, it came very near being murder." "Murder!" exclaimed the youth and Ellen, both at once. "Yes, murder. But I read 'in the papers that Mr. Onderdonk didn't die, after all. Ha, he's got a tough stom- ach, for I ldicked him hard enough to send the life out of him." The genius now gave them a detail- ed account of the combat at Yonker's, and ended by telling them that Solo- mon had offered a large reward for his  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7736-00000059"/> arrest, and that the constables were searching for him, high and low. He told them, too, how generous Mr. Ever- et had been in purchasing his whole collection of stuffed birds and animals; and as he spoke he pulled out of his pocket and threw down on the desk a purse full of gold, and was about giv- ing an outline of what his plans were for the future, when Dick interrupted him, saying: "And that gentleman has also been most kind to us. He has given Ellen a farm with a good house on it, into which we will move next week. Oh, what fun it will be screaming at Grumpy Solomon as we go past his place, for I hate him worse than ever!" You see," remarked Ellen, leaning on Nat's shoulder, "Dick has had two 'persons to grieve for, not only were you missing, but so was Lizzie, and she is yet in some unknown spot. But I tell c him to trust in God, and that all will s be right at last. Things indeed begin ' to look brighter already."    1 "Yes they do i" said Nat, cracking I his knuckles in token of his joy. "I've t had a stroke of inspiration; and even h without Mr. Everet's assistance we \ should be on the road to fortune. Now, ] if you wish, I will briefly unfold my t scheme, which must, however, remain a u profound secret between us; even to s Lizzie, Dick, When she comes back, it y must not be revealed."      ti "I What I am about to tell," he con- tinued, " may make you smile, but that a shan't discourage me, for all great un- d dertakings have been scoffed at at the C beginning. Richard bring me a piece of a bread-fresh, if you have it."   k "Now," he resumed, rolling a few d crumbs together between the palms of his hands until they assumed the shape " of little balls, and then giving them to p   e Ellen to feel, "these are to be called e 'blood pills'-easy to make, ei? And r- here," pulling from his pocket a solid e sheet of foolscap, " here is the adver- ; tisement, which will not only be print- s ed in the newspapers but likewise writ- a ten in glaring letters on every rock in - the land. Listen and I will read it: "s Gregory's Magic Blood Pills. A purely i vegetable compound, and sovereign remedy for all diseases of the throat, i stomach, heart, and liver. Joy cometh to the afflicted! The millenium ap- proaches!" "Short and sweet!" remarked Dick, striving to appear grave. "I already see Prudence Mather dosing herself with them; I know she's out of order some- where, or she'd not be so snarly. Grumpy, too, will patronize them." "The fact is," continued Nat, taking no notice of the interruption, but ad- dressing himself solely to Ellen, whose scruples he was anxious to remove, "we live in the age of humbug, and this medicine is certainly an imposition. But then it is a very innocent one, for the pills will injure no man, not even if he swallow half a bushel of 'em ; and it will be a great consolation to know that I have kept thousands of patients from taking the horrid trash which the 'reg- ular-practice' quacks are so fond of pre- scribing. Oh, dearest, do not shake your head, what harm is there in doing this?" "By jingo! it's a sublime idea!" again interrupted Dick, rolling half a dozen crumbs between his hands as Gregory had done, then throwing them all into his mouth at once. "Easiest kind of physic to take. I wonder you didn't think of it before." "But, Nat," said the young woman, "are you really in earnest? For my part I could not approve of your mak-   ing money in such a way, for it does not seem honest." "Oh, Ellen! if the dedr public never has anything worse done to it, than what I propose doing, 'twill get off cheap!" "Owing to that. unfortunate occur- rence at Yonker's, it would not be pos- sible for me to stay at home just yet, for if I did I would be discovered, and probably put in prison, and it will be necessary for me to remain disguised until Mr. Onderdonk and Prudence have cooled down a little; but when this difficulty is forgotten, I'll come back with plenty of money in my pock- et-throw off my wig and spectacles, and then nothing but death shall ever part us again." ("And I," remarked Dick, " will be just as anxious as sister to have you here, for I cannot leave her alone, and go off in search of Lizzie." "And when the happy day arrives: that will see us all once more united, I move that we bid farewell .to this part of the country, and go west; yes, clear to the Pacific i." resumed Gregory. "Oh, Ellen! do not sigh, I am not a dreamer. There are bright days in store for us." The young woman vainly endeavor- ed to smile, but-her heart was too full; nor did she say anything further to dis- courage Nat, who was evidently bent on carrying out the plan which he called inspired; and when he whispered in her   ear a few fond words, she said "I will pray for you!" The conversation now came to an end, and the taxidermist went out with Dick to attend to his horse, which all this while had been left hitched to the gate post, in front of the cabin. "- I guess it's time for me to go to roost, myself," said Gregory, "for I must be off by break of day. But you shall not be so long again without hear- ing from me. I will give you my ad- dress, Richard, and I beg you will write often and tell me all about Ellen; and if her health fails, I'll return im- mediately, and brave Grumpy Solomon and all his constables." In less than a quarter of an hour af- ter this the cabin was silent, the family had retired to rest, and the mice had a great feast on the crumbs of bread that had been scattered about the floor. Dick was soon in dream-land, and be- held Prudence dosing herself with Nat's blood pills; and, indeed, many others seeking relief from their ailments in this wonderful medicine. Finally, he dream- ed that he saw Nat grinning and heard him give his knuckles a violent crack- ing, and at that instant he awoke, and by the light which streamed in through the hole cut in the side of the house, he realized that the day had dawned; and starting up and, turning his eyes to- wards Gregory's couch, he found that the genius had departed.  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7736-00000060"/> CHAPTER XVIII.   SUMMER has passed, and the frosty October mornings have come. The leaves upon the trees have exchanged their green for tints of crimson and gold ; and Harriet Everet, who had never before past an Autumn in the country, wondered why fashionable people flocked into town at the very season when nature is attired in her most gorgeous apparel. The farm which her father had pur- chased, was, as we have already said, about a mile west of the village, and comprised a little more than seventy acres. This, it is true, was not a very large place, yet there was upon it every- j thing required to make it an agreeable i country home. The dwelling stood E about a hundred yards from the high- x way, and was reached by a lane, lined r on either side with locust trees, while c behind the house was an apple orchard, ii a favorite resort oft truant shool-boys, l who   frequently were seen throwing h stones up at the fruit; and why not, s since they knew the only punishment sl they would receive, if caught, would be tl a  gentle reproof from  Harriet, who m would afterwards fill their pockets and hi tell theln to ask permission the next time they wanted any?      H The well was deep and the water de- in licious, and we believe that nothing in had contributed so much to make Mr. f,( Everet hale and hearty again as the draught which he used to take out of wa the iron-bound bucket. To  see him the now, one would hardly believe him the loc same being, so straight does he hold get   sty; himself, and so cheerfully does he tall 'he to his daughter as they ramble together ;ed over the wheat stubble, admiring the nd quails, which seem to prefer his fields ad to those of his neighbors, for they cer- he tainly flock here in great numbers. )le He appears never to tire of looking ry at his indian corn, and the blue jays er which peck away at the golden ears, so unconcernedly, although he may be r- standing close to them. Indeed, we d, almost believe the crows have a spice id of contempt for Mr. Everet, for they ;y hop about and caw by the hour, within 2y easy stone's throw of the rock where r- he sits reading his "Agriculturist," say- e ing, perhaps, to each other, "He's d green ; he don't know enough to drive - us away!"But these saucy birds were d mistaken if they supposed their depre- e dations were borne so calmly, through , ignorance on his part of the thefts they , were committing. The truth is, his, r health of mind and body had become , so completely restored under the clear sky and in the delicious country air, that he could not find it in his heart to make war upon anything he saw around him. But if his face bore the hue of health, Harriet, on the contrary, had less color in her cheeks now than when she dwelt in the city;- and he was beginning to feel solicitous on her account. "  Tell me," he said one morning to- wards the middle of October, while they were walking between the rows of locust trees, " are you not longing to get away from here?"   i' No, father, no 1" she exclaimed. I love my new home, and would not change it for the whole of St. John's Square, with all its gaiety and its ef- feminate, conceited people." He pursued the subject no further, for there was something in her manner which showed that it was painful to her; nevertheless, he could not help studying her countenance, and wonder- ing how it was that she who had for- merly been so buoyant and full of life, now rarely opened her lips unless she was spoken to. Presently they stopped, and seating themselves upon his favorite rock, which was covered with a soft carpet of moss, they began to read. The farmer, for we can no longer style him banker, had become deeply interested in bees, and there was a chapter on these in- sects which he wanted to finish this forenoon; while his daughter unfolded a letter that had reached her the day before, which had already been several times perused, and which she was now going to read over again. As it may prove interesting, we will take the liberty of peeping over her shoulder and read it, too: No. - St. John's Square, } October i6th, 1839.  MY DEAR MSS EVERET; I have already written you a dozen epistles since you left New York, but to none of them have I received an an- swer, in consequence of which silence on your part my state of mind can hardly be conceived. My health is giving way under this dreadful state of suspense; and when I look in the mir- ror I can hardly realize that it is my own person that is reflected thereby. The club has no longer any charms for me, and I ride up and down town in an omnibus, from breakfast to dinner time, just to dispel corroding thoughts. Really, I begin to fear I shall become distracted. If I have offended you in1   any possible way, say but the word and I will hasten to your father's plantation (mother declares that it is not a farm), and on bended knees will crave pardon. Father is rapidly sinking, and will hard- ly live till Christmas; and yet, (would you believe it?) mother says I ought to leave at once for Andalusia, on account of my lungs. Now, truly, it puzzles me to know why she wishes me to exile myself; and yet, dearest Harriet, if I could only carry you with me, I would cheerfully go to the remotest corner of the earth. Yes, and were it even Kam- scatlka, 1 would think it a paradise. Oh 1 do not, I entreat you, refuse to correspond! Would to heaven some fairy would fold me up in this letter, that I might once more feel the touch of your hand. Yours, devotedly, JAMES MERRYWEATHER, JR. When she commenced reading, there was a slight flush upon her counte- nance, which, however, quickly disap- peared ; and after she had finished and thrust the letterlagain into her pocket, she became as moody as before. Poor Harriet! how fondly she loved Dick ; and yet whenever she went to visit Ellen in her new home, the youth rarely opened his lips ; and if his eyes flashed it was only when the name of Solomon Onderdonk was mentioned. But as we have already said, she admir- ed him all the more for his constancy, which stood proof against the power of wealth; for although living in a farm house, it was easy for the world to dis- cover that Mr. Everet was a rich man, and that none but a person far above Dick in the social scale, according to Mrs. Merryweather's standard, might presume to woo his daughter. As for her feelings towards James Merryweather, they had not been changed in the least by his passionate letters, which had all been duly re- ceived. She never had really loved him,  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7736-00000061"/> and deeply regretted the pain which her present coldness was causing him. He was so persevering, too, that she feared, unless a firm and decided an- swer was sent to this last appeal, he might appear before her some bright morning, and make his suit in person. She had at one time been under' the impression that he sought her hand for the sake of her fortune only; but since he had written these notes, she no longer believed him actuated by sor- did motives, but that his protestations of love were sincere. "And who knows," she thought as she sat with her face bu-ried in her hands, " but he may really go distracted about me! O Dick I Dick!" "I wish, my daughter," said Mr. Everet, as he finished the last page of f his book, " that you would read this J treatise on -bee culture, for I intend next I Spring to have a great many hives, and you will have -the charge of them. But, t Harriet, you are ill!"      c "No, no!" she replied, starting, and g looking confused. "I was thinking, sir----"  "Of the gay season which will so h soon commence in New York.   Well, if you shall go back and enjoy yourself; b it was cruel in me to----"  "No, never "  responded Harriet, cc her manner indicating that she had ful- al ly made up her mind to associate no y more with the fashionable set, among whom, for a brief season, she had been in the fairest of the fair.      a "If I were to return," she continued, be bowing her head to hide a tear, "I ex could not feel-as I once did."   ep "Strange world 1" -thought her pa- fin rent; "when I was miserable, she was .  so cheerful I and now, just as every- thing has become sunlight to me, she ler droops, and looks paler than I everfrer   h did. There seems to be a skeleton in i. every closet l" e  They were now about to separate, the - father to look at some workmen who e were building a stone wall, his daughter t to feed her poultry, when they were ar- rested by the approach of Dick, who in r; one hand carried a superb bouquet, and [' in the other -a letter. t  After the first words of greeting were over, the lad, who was dressed in a plain, but substantial suit of clothes, presented the flowers to Harriet, whose heart immediately began to flutter; but before she had done thanking him, he smiled and whispered : "They're not a present from me, Miss." At once her color changed, and it flashed upon her mind that it was James who had sent them, perhaps brought them himself. "And he may be even now," she thought, "lurking behind some fence or tree, watching me with his opera- glass." But Dick, when she urged him to ex- plain, declared that a servant in livery had met him in the village and asked if he would not take charge of letter and bouquet and bring them here. He then handed her the missive, which she felt certain came from James, but a glance at the writting proved it to be from that young gentleman's mother. She tore it open, and was about read- ing it, when a tiny black ball rolled out and fell upon her lap. What it might be, she could not imagine; and after examining it a moment, she began the epistlein hopes that she would there find an explanation. It ran thus: " DEAR HARRIET :" Being no longer able to remain si- lent, I have determined to open 'a cor- respondence with you, which I hope   may prove mutually agreeable-to me, because I wish to get tidings of your father, in whose welfare I take such a deep interest; and to you, because I shall be able to furnish a minute ac- count of all that occurs in New York society. We missed you ever so much at Saratoga and Newport this season, and hundreds have pressed me to give them your address; and you need not be astonished if some day you have a surprise party on the plantation. How does your father endure his exile? I know why he has fled from the world-it is a great secret-but tell him, my dear, that he must not de- spair I These japonicas and roses which I send will remind -him of other days. I made up the bouquet myself, intend- ing it as a present for him ; but do not mention this, for I know that he wishes to forget and be forgotten. Let him inhale their fragrance, however, and re- member the donor. The pill which 1 enclose is called "Gregory's magic blood pill;" and, upon my word, it's effect on the spirits is indeed magical, and that is why I wish Mr. Everet to try it. Urge him to buy a box of them, for although they only appeared this Summer they are already celebrated and can be procured at any drug store. Tell him that lif he can manage to endure the wilderness until Spring, all will be right. As for my poor husband, he is failing day by day, and if suffer- ings in this life can form any claim to happiness in the next, then he will surely be in the seventh heaven. Oh! what a dreadful blow his death will be! for I then will find myself a lonely widow. But if you and your father will only not forget me, it will prove a great consolation. "Love not, for what you love may die," the poet says. Oh I little did I dream that I would outlive my husband! I winmce so delicate I and when I   contemplate him lying in the cold, cold ground-Oh, Harriet! it is terrible! Do not fail, dearest, to answer this, and go into details about your present mode of life ; and remember me kind- ly to your father. Your true friend, MARY MERRYWEATHER. "Mrs. Merryweather asks after you, sir, and bids me let you smell these flowers," said Harriet, placing the bou- quet in his hands. "But I wish she would not write to me, her letters are so full of nonsense." "But she is the leader of fashionable society, my daughter; better corres- pond with her than not," replied Mr.' Everet, who regretted more and more' that he had broken up his city home and brought Harriet to this retired spot. "When we go back, she may be of great service to you." 1"But I repeat, sir, I do not care for New York; I beg of you to let me re- main. here." "No," whispered Dick, who bad thrown himself on the rock beside her, "do not abandon Ellen; her cough is 'growing worse, and she's getting more feeble every day." Harriet was about to say something to comfoirt the youth, when he started up, and, with an expression of anger on his countenance, exclaimed : "There comes Grumpy Solomon!" and immediately seizing her hand, he pressed it warmly between his, then begging her to put no faith in anything Mr. Onderdonk might say, he hurried off in an opposite direction.  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7736-00000062"/> CHAPTER XIX.   ,yES, he is working hard against us, and so is Prudence," said Dick to Ellen, as she sat in an easy chair that evening, close by the tea-table, not caring to eat, for her appetite was all gone, but listening attentively to every word that dropped from the lips of the youth. "I'm sure, how ever, Miss Everet and her father won't believe his lies, though he is very oily, and can talk religion as well as Parson Jeremiah." "Well, indeed, what is there he can say against me or you, or even against Nat?" exclaimed the young woman, "for certainly Gregory was right to de- fend himself when he was attacked in Yonker's; and if he happened to kick Mr. Onderdonk rather too hard, it was ] in self-defence. But; pray, what are I the stories he is telling about us?" For a moment the youth sipped his tea without answering, for, in truth, he s could not repeat the scandal which had t been spread abroad concerning her. His own indignation against Solomon n was already so great that he could with n difficulty restrain himself from com- mitting some overt act; and he feared so that if she knew the truth, it might be h more than she could bear in her present 1 delicate state, when the least excitement fc biought on a  spell of coughing. "Well, sister, Grumpy swears that I'm a  vagabond, and that I ought to be D turned out of the house; and he de- clares, too, that I used to steal his t books, just because one which Lizzie pC   s,! had lent me was found in the cabin af ck ter wel eft." at  "Oh brother if that is all, you musn't ot mind." " "But it isn't; and yet it's all I can ry tell you of, sister. Please don't ask me ie anything further; what I said is true; Mr. Onderdonk is doing his best to in- d jure us in the estimation of Miss Har- h riet and her father; and if they do put s faith in his atrocious falsehoods, then let us leave here and go to Ohio, where Lizzie is-and yet it wouldn't astonish t me a bit if she were much nearer East- chester than Ohio." "What reason have you for thinking 1 so?" "Humph," continued Dick, shaking his head, "I have, indeed, no positive , proof; still there are moments when I can't help believing Prudence has her again locked up in the stone house- she's bad enough to do anything Grumpy tells her to." 'Nonsense, brother, nonsense--do not allow such thoughts to occupy your mind." "Well, you know that Gregory him- self hints at it in his last letter; and as he spoke he drew from his pocket the letter in question and reperused the following portion of it : "NEW LONDON, Conn.,) October Ist, I859. v DEAR RICHARD, This is the third time I have written, and I have in return received two let- ters from you, so thus far our corres- pondence has gone on swimmingly.   My prospects are growing brighter and 'brighter, and at the rate my pills are now selling it will not take long for me to make a fortune. Of course the ' re- gular-practice quacks ' are doing their utmost to put me down, but in vain. A wealthy and influential citizen, of New London, who for years had been suffering from neuralgia, and had tried every doctor in Connecticut, and he swallowed physic enough to start a re- spectable drug-store, was cured by a sin- gle box of my pills ; and he was so re- joiced at recovering his health, that he sought me out, embraced me right in the main street before hundreds oft people, and then introduced me to the i crowd as the greatest benefactor of the i human race that had lived since the i fall of the Roman Empire, and that, I, believe, was a good while ago. I need not tell you how I felt at that moment. I endeavored to remain calm and not grin or crack my knuckles, but I couldn't; and. I said to myself, "What a power there is in humbug when right- ly applied." This gentleman saved me, moreover, a considerable sum of money, for he insisted on paying my hotel bill, and then again he was instrumental in procuring me a public reception in a big building called the Academy of Science, and ever since then my name has been on every citizen's tongue, and several mothers have christened their babies after me. Already my medicine is widely known in the rural districts, for on every rock, stone wall, and barn door, are painted the words "Gregory's Magic Blood Pills," so that the country folks, as they go by, can't help seeing them. In fact, my business has increased so, rapidly that I have been obliged to procure a partner, and a very fine fellow he is. His name is Jeremiah Conklin. All his life, until he met me, had been spent in hoeing corn and raising pumpkins; and I do believe he would have turned into a vegetable at last, if I had not rescued him from his danger-by point- ing out the folly of trying to grow rich on a farm, and given him a chance in my line. Of course I didn't tell him what the pills are made of-and, in fact,   he didn't seem to care about knowing, so long as we sold plenty of 'em. Even I you, Richard, could not guess how I manufacture them, Why, in half a minute I can make hundreds. You see, I have invented a machine with a I pair of steel fingers to it, and a roller that picks out ever so many pieces of bread at a time, and turns them into little balls in the twinkling of an eye- after which, it boxes them up, and there they are all ready for sale." Thus far did Dick peruse the letter in silence, for he knew how much Ellen regretted the mode in which her lover !was making money, and he did not want to cause her pain by reminding her of it. Now, however he commenced * reading aloud: "I cannot tell you, Richard, how thankful I am that you and dear Ellen are in such a snug home, with kind friends near, and that Ellen's health is improving. (We will here mention that the young woman had begged Dick not to write any bad news concerning her- self.) And I dare say you will both pass a very comfortable winter-fot the sum which I remit in this letter will supply all your wants for so ne time to come. Lizzie, I am sorry to hear, has j not yet written to you. Well, I have cogitated on her case a good deal this past week, and have come to the con- elusion that she is closer to you than you imagine. I can't believe she would stay in Ohio and not send you a line, if only to let you know her address. Yes, depend upon it, there is some dark piece of work going on between Mr. Onderdonk and  L'IL Uicnce Mather. Why, years ago, there was a gentleman named Alexander Norris who disap- peared most mysteriously, and it was in Eastchester he was last seen; and I once heard an old chap, who is now dead, say that Solomon used to turn pale whenever this was spoken of in nis presence; and pretended to have the ague, so lolks wouldn't wonder at his trembling. The eldest of the old maids is his match in everything, and between them bcah there would be no scruple  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7736-00000063"/> about shutting Lizzie up in the house by the creek until her death, for I learn that the land on which Grumpy has ; built his large mansion belongs to her; and if she were out of the way the title would vest in him. But on this sub- ject I will say nothing further at pres- ent- -"a word to the wise is sufficient. ' Just-ask Solomon some day if Lizzie is not with the Miss Mather's, and watch if he gets nervous at the question; and if he does, let me know immediately. j Now, Richard, give lots of love to I Ellen, and tell her I know she must be t praying hard for my success, as the gold is pouring in so fast that I can hardly count it. Tell her, too, that by 3 Spring I will pay you another visit, and I perhaps stay with you for good.  t Your affectionate cousin, NAT GREGORY.  d "What a happy day that will be! tW Oh I may Spring soon come!" exclaim- E ed the young woman. "Yes, sister, winter will pass quick- l ly, and happily, too, for I will read to b you evenings, and will write to Nat very often; in fact do everything you ,I wish; and you won't have to speak in half a dozen times to get me to move, as you did when we lived on mill-lane." "I have no doubt that you will make thE me as comfortable as you can, but Miss an Everet says she is going to hire a wo- the man to come and do the house-work." of "Indeed! How very kind.  But do ren you know, sister, I feel sorry to see her sut living so far from all those rich friends sell   se who came to visit her at her city home rn the day I'was there. She does not seem so happy as when I first met her le last Spring. I think she feels lonely )- here, and yet she declares she prefers 3- the country." "^   (Perhaps she says that in order to h please her father. How is he?" asked d Ellen, who, being quite blind, could not judge of Mr. Everet's appearance when o he called on, her, which he did several e times a week. e  "Oh, he looks as brown as a hazel- t nut, and says that he never knew what i life was until he came here. Every- thingf pleases him ; and I've seen him watch the swallows by the hour as they darted over his meadows; and the only time I ever saw him frown was once when I began throwing stones at them. He rises before the sun, and actually chops, or rather tries to chop, his own wood.  But, sister----' and here Dick burst out laughing, and it was some minutes before he was able to' resume. "But, sister, he--he's a believer in-- in -" "W ell, in what, brother?" "In Gregory's blood-pills I He has them sent by mail from New York!" and he rubbed his hands, and was on the point of launching forth into praises of the young man's inspiration, when he remembered that it was not a pleasant subject to Ellen, and he -checked him- selfL   CHAPTER XX.   ONCE -more we find ourselves at the stone house by the creek; but months have gone by since we last saw it. Summer, Autumn, and Winter have fled, aad Spring has returned. It is sun-set, and in the room where once the crazy man was confined, and as close to the window as the iron bars will permit, is a girl whom we know, and yet so thin and haggard has she become, that we can hardly recognize in her the once blooming Lizzie Onder- donk. Verily, Prudence and Solomon have played their part well, and now their fiendish work would seem almost ac- complished. Indeed, nothing but Abi- gail's care, and the words of hope which she has secretly whispered to the prisoner, have kept the -life in her so long. On the table where Norris used to play solitaire, lies a manuscript written by the elder sister, and left here ex- pressly- for the girl to read, which is well calculated to make the blood run cold, for it is full of stories about the mysterious occurrences which, during these latter years, have rendered this abode so gloomy. First, as if to begin with what was most horrible, is a de- tailed account of Harvey's suicide, and coupled with it is the expressed belief that the house is haunted by his. spirit--in proof of which the frequent hearing of footsteps, the rappings on the walls, and the moving of the furni- ture about the rooms, are adduced. s Once only had the prisoner ventured   to turn over a few of its pages; and when she asked the younger sister to r tell her what she supposed these mani- festations were, the poor creature shud- dered and replied with bated breath, "It's the devil!" During the first week of her confine- ment she had indulged the belief that Mr. Onderdonk intended merely to gratify a whim of Prudence, and that before many days she would be re.- leased, and sent off to visit her aunt. But weeks became months, and still her father did not come near her. Oh! how often did she think of Dick, Greg- ory, and Ellen, but more especially of the sun-burnt youth. On one occasion Prudence brought her supper, instead of Abigail, and told her that Dick was not living in the cabin now, but in a much finer house, and was going to marry a rich young lady from New York, and of course this recalled to her mind the stranger whom she had seen walking one day with the lad across the field opposite her father's house. Still, she refused to believe he had so soon forgotten her, and gave no credence to the story. At length certain ominous remarks of Abigail's roused her to a sense of the fate which was being prepared for her ; and this evening, as she sat watch- ing the last rays of the setting sun upon the surface of the creek, there came over her a feeling of despair; for al- though the younger of the old maids was,evidently disposed to help her, the awe in which she stood of Prudence  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7736-00000064"/> would more than likely prevent her from taking any decided steps for her deliverance. While she thus sat musing, footsteps were heard in the entry, the key softly turned in the lock, and Abbe glided in, appearing greatly agitated; and having closed the door, locked it again, then advanced on tip-toe. It was evi- dent she had some important commu- nication to make, and Lizzie anticipat- ed her by exclaiming-- "Pray, what is the matter?" Husli! not now-by   and by," ' whispered the woman, whose counte- nance showed increased agitation. "If 1 I am discovered it will' be the last of  me; aye, and of you, too. And she t stood for a while listening, and hardly 2 daring to breathe. Hearing her sister i calling loudly to her from below, she a gasped "I must be off, but trust in me P -I'll come back again soon and tell b you what I want you to do."    h She now hurried away, leaving Liz- h zie in a perfect state of bewilderment. a After Lizzie had partially recovered u] from the effects of the strange words, ul and the still stranger demeanor of Miss Abigail, she sought the little window of her prison. The moon was shining a brightly, and by its light she beheld wi two persons--a man and a  woman- wi moving along the edge of the creek. ha They were sauntering side by side to- wards a  skiff which lay fastened to a an stake on the meadow, and which had wa floated uselessly there for many a day -the village boys not liking to come rat to fish, since Dick had told them such yoi strange stories about the place-on pie reaching which, they stopped, and seemed to be debating some question Li; with great earnestness. Thus they oc- me cupied about half an hour, when they Wf turned and walked towards the house. be   her She heard them enter, and the discus- her sion appeared not yet ended, for there were angry voices below, and once she ips thought she heard Abigail replying tly boldly to something which had been ed said to her. As we may imagine, the nd captive felt very uneasy, divining that in, some mischief was on the tapis. The vi- clock struck ten, and still the talking u- continued. At length it grew less loud, it- and towards midnight it ceased alto- gether, when she ventured to throw-her- self on her couch. But her eyes could " only remain closed for an instant, then e- they would open again and turn towards If the manuscript which Prudence had )f cautioned her sister not to remove from e the table. No wonder, then,-that Liz- y zie's mind became filled with strange r ideas; and the few pieces of furniture, e as the moonbeams fell upon them, ap- e peared changed into weird, fantastic 1 beings. After a  while she fell into a half unconscious state, which might - hardly be called sleep, but soon was awakened by something cold pressing [ upon her forehead. She was about to , utter a shriek, when a voice whispered "Hush, hush!" "Oh!" she continued, "I have had a  hard time since I left you! O that wicked man I and my sister, too, is very wicked. But I knew it would end as it has; 1 said so from the beginning." The woman now commencedto weep, and it was some minutes before she was able to resume; "But I'm determined that you, at any rate, shall not be harmed. I will save you, and then let them do what they please with me." "Mercy I am I in a dream!" cried Lizzie, clutching her arm. "Oh tell me, Miss Abigail, am I in a dream? What sin have I committed that I should be persecuted in this way?"   "'Twas a foul piece of business from the very beginning!" muttered the old maid. "Some blood may be shed.; but I vow it shall not be yours." "Speak I tell me," continued the girl " can we not both escape? There is the door; let us flee to the village." "No, your father is sleeping on a mattress at the foot of the steps ; it can- not be done to-night. But take this piece of wood, and put it in the key hole after I have gone out; it will pre-   vent anybody from turning the lock. Should he attempt to break down the door, he'll have to kill me before my sister's eyes, for I shall defend you as long as I have a breath left, Three low taps will be a signal that I want to be let in, and then you may clear the key hole. Now I must return to my own chamber, as sister or Mr. Onderdonk might come prowling about. Good night." And kissing her on the cheek, Abbe softly withdrew.  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7736-00000065"/> CHAPTER XXT.   UNDOUBTEDLY one of the most difficult things in the world is to hide ourselves from those whom we do not desire to be particularly intimate with. At least so thought Harriet Everet the first time she beheld Mrs. Merryweather driving up the lane in her barouche. It was the last week of March, 1840. The frost was coming out of the ground, and the wheels, as they sank in the deep ruts, made it heavy work for the horses; but still the coachman urged them briskly on, for the haughty lady was impatient and was turning her eyes first on one side, then on the other, in hopes of catching a glimpse of the re- tired banker. She had not paid him an earlier visit because she thought it would only serve to harrow his feelings; whereas now she could present herself before him with glad tidings on her lips. "She is in mourning!" said Harriet, as she stood in front of the farm-house where she had been for the last ten minutes watching some bees which were just returning from their hives after their winter's repose. "Mr. Merryweather must be dead 1" "What a dreary, God-forsaken spot!" f thought the leader of fashion, glancing  at the grey stone wall and leafless trees.  "And all this on my account I But he s shall be an exile no longer l" Then  biddingpthe coachman drive still faster, a she arrived in another moment at the door. The meeting was a cordial one, at 1 least on the part of Mrs. Merryweather.:    t Harriet had nothing to do but allow , herself to be embraced, and as she felt ) the tears dropping upon her neck, she entertained a kindlier feeling for the t lady than she ever had before; for now, indeed, Mrs. Merryweather was a lone- ly widow, and had come here to seek consolation. 'My daughter!" were the first words the latter uttered, followed by a hys- terical sob, "Oh, my daughter, he- suf- fered very much, and now it's all over! He has gone to his eternal reward." Here her voice became so choked that she could proceed no further, but lean- ed with all her weight on Harriet, who found her a heavy burthen to support. I' How is your beloved parent?" she whispered after an interval of silent grief. "'You are much paler, yourself, my daughter; your face, doubtless, is the reflection of his own unhappiness. But it's over at last. Mny poor dear husband! what a sufferer he was!" Her arms were now thrown around Miss Everet's neck, and the young lady was beginning to feel decidedly uncom- fortable. Presently Mr. Everet's step was heard approaching, and in another mo- ment he stood before them, clad in a shabby coat, with his pants tucked in- side of his boots, and looking, as lihe was fond of expressing it, " as hearty as a buck." At first he scarcely recognized the visitor, in her sable attire, and she, on her part, hardly recognized Mr. Everet. As she scanned his ruddy, jovial coun-   tenance, therefore, she was startled,:for n it was evident his rustic home had: not t increased his unhappiness. . Harriet expected to-witness a fresh burst of grief at the meeting between the widow and her father, but in this d she was disappointed. It is true- the n pearly drops did for an instant glisten I on the eyelids of the bereaved lady, but only for an instant, and then there stole over her countenance such an ex- r pressionof joy, that Mr.' Everet, as he c took her by the hand, and led her to a seat on the stoop, might have fancied t her a saint in ecstacy.  "He was a Christian," she murmur- - ed, and that consoles me in his loss. I know he li's in bliss. You, si(, who  are a widoWer, can tell how much relig- j ion sustains one in these moments of- bereavement." For a brief period there was silence. Mr. Everet, who had always been on most intimate terms withethe late Mr. Merryweather, felt his loss keenly ; and the shortness. and uncertainty of life were strongly impressed upon him by this sad news. Not wishing, however, to give way too much to solemn thoughts, lest his former depression of spirits might re- turn, he said: "Let us go and see the farm, madam. I have a superb litter of young pigs, and some very fine calves, which I should like to show you." Another start, and again she scanned his features that she might read his thoughts. "Catt it be his intention to propose to me in the barn-yard? Or is this all a delusion on my part?" she said, as she rose with a fluttering heart to ac- company him. But while they were waiting a moment for Harriet, who had   run up stairs to get her a thicker shawl to wear, the gentleman continued: "What has become of James? He . has not. paid us a single visit since we have been here." "Well, sir, my son has been very delicate all winter, and unless he takes my advice and goes to a milder clime, I fear he will go into a decline." "But I declare, here he comes!" ex- claimed Mr. Everet, "and riding very- rapidly, too. Ho! Robert!" he called out to a hired boy- who was at work near the house, "go and take charge of that gentleman's horse." "'Perverse youth!" muttered Mrs Merryweather, grinding her teeth. "I knew I'd overtake you," exclaim- ed her son, springing from the saddle, just as Harriet appeared with the shawl. No sooner did the latter see -him than she stopped and was about to retire, when he prevented her by quickly ad- vancing and placi,ng'himself at her side. "Mother wants, me to go to Spain,. but I never shall!" he said in a tremu- ' lous voice. "Never, Miss Everet, un- til-- " here he sighed, and left the phrase unfinished. I It were perhaps better, sir, for you. i to follow her advice," replied the young - lady. This remark had anything but. encouragement in-it for the persevering * suitor; hut Harriet, divining the object. , of his visit, deemed it advisable, at. I .once, to check further overtures on his part in the direction of a proposal of d marriage. S  "It's a fair race between us," solilo-- quized Mrs. Merryweather, eyeing them e both like a lynx. "Oh! if Mr. Everet. "would only speak out his sentiments, iS at once, my agony would be over. How. c- terrible is a state of suspense."' re  Presently Harriet and James entered; d the parlor, and the widow slipped her  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7736-00000066"/> arm through Mr. Everet's and went off to view the little pigs and calves. "How delightful the country is!" he exclaimed as they walked towards the barn; "how foolish men are to wear themselves out in the city." "Your health is better, then, sir?" "Why, look at met ha, ha! lWhat- ever ailments I may have had are all gone. I feel young again, and frisky as a lamb, in fact, all I needed was out- door life." "Oh my!" exclaimed Mrs. Merry- weather, leaning heavily on ;his arm, "Please take me back, sir; I'm grow- ing faint."            j But before he could respond to this ( request she sank to the ground. ,In a I few moments the whole household was e gathered round her, Harriet holding a t vinaigrette to her nostrils; while James E gazed at the lovely maiden, and looked i very much dejected.  Mr. Everet was h ,engaged in fanning the unhappy lady, and at the same  time gave orders to h have a  horse saddled and a doctor I brought as quickly as possible. The si swooning lady soon recovered, however, n   ff and his services were not required. "Pray allow us to carry you in doors, e madam, you are still weak,' said Mr. e Everet. r  "I am quite able to walk, sir," she answered in a tone which surprised everybody. "It was this chilly dismal air that brought on the attack; all I 1 want is to get back to New York. I beg of you to order my carriage." "But it is going to rain," said Mr. Everet; " do remain at least until the sky clears; you must not leave us just yet." But in a few minutes she was seated inf her carriage--an open one-and driving off, to the great regret of coach- man and groom, who cast sundry un- easy glances up at the clouds; and to the ro small mortification of the retired banker and his daughter, who could not imagine what they had done to offend her. It only remains to add that James had pressed his suit to a crisis with Harriet, and that he had full cause to sympathise with his mother, for he had met with a prompt refusal.   CH:APTER XXIL.   MRS. MERRYWEATHER never made a second visit to Mr. Everet's "plantation," as she had been wont to term it, but lived in seclusion, deeply impressed with the vanity of sublunary things. The only consolation she seem- ed to have was that her son met with no better success than herself, verify- ing, in her case, the truth of the maxim, "misery loves company." Rapidly the Spring days were pass- ing with Mr. Everet, to whom all was joy and sun-shine-but not so with his daughter. Thie efforts she made, how- ever, to conceal her feelings were so successful, that her parent began to flatter himself she was becoming like her former self again, If her cheeks were yet colorless, there was more fre- quently a smile on her lips; and if she did not laugh as merrily as had been her wont, at least she rarely sighed. ' "Father loves the country," she would say to herself as she accom- panied him to the different parts of the, farm, " and I must appear happy for his sake. Yes, it was wrong ever to let him see my grief." To Ellen and Dick, during the past. winter, shehad been perfectly devoted; and it is difficult to say what they would have done without her. It is true Grogory had frequently sent them letters containing 'money, and cheered them by promises to re- turn in April. But the youth had been taken ill, shortly after New Year's, with scarlet-fever; and the young woman's cough had continually grown worse;   so that, although they were in a much more comfortable dwelling than the cabin on mill-lane, they yet would have suffered many deprivations but for Harriet's kindness. During his con- valescence, Dick had been greatly amused by the stories she would relate at his bed-side. And once, when she recited to him how her father had dis- covered the moss entirely scraped from a favorite rock of his, and defaced by the words, "Gregory's Magic Blood Pills," he laughed immoderately. The very first question he asked, after the fever left him, was in relation to Lizzie Onderdonk; and nothing would paci- fy him but a promise from Harriet that she would start off to Eastchester, without delay, and efideavor to obtain tidings of the girl. He had confided to her Gregory's suspicions that she was shut up in the stone house by the creek, and urged her to ask Solomon about it. In compliance with this request, Harriet took an early opportunity to visit Eastchester, but all her efforts to obtain information concerning the miss- ; ing young girl were futile. She found, tduring her brief stay, however, that al- though few of the village people liked Mr. Onderdonk, the worst accusation that was brought against him, was that he was irritable and close-fisted. Astin nearly all American villages, the population of this one had materi- ally changed in the course of the past twenty years; and those who might ;perhaps have told her about Harvey  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7736-00000067"/> Mather, the publican and bosom friend of Solomon, and whispered the dark suspicions which at one time had arisen concerning the .disappearance of Alex- ander Norris, were either dead or had migrated to the Western country., It was about a week after the sudden departure of Mrs. Merryweather' from th'e ' plantation,"' that Harriet and her father were returning at rather a later hour than usual from a visit to Ellen and Dick. ' They were going briskly along the high-way when suddenly they came upon a man, with a lantern hung on his arm, painting something on the stone-wall near by. "I've found you  out- at last," -exclaimed Mr. Everet. l "You're  the fellow  who disfigures the landscape with magic blood pill 1 advertisements."  "Yes, I'm general superintendent of I this branch of the business, although, b properly speaking, I am Dr. Gregory's m partner," answered the stranger.  A "Dear me!" exclaimed Mr. Everet, r leaning towards the speaker so as to a obtain a better view of his face, 't is 'it b possible you are Jeremiah Conklin?" w "That's my name," responded- the Y man, with no little surprise.   ir "Well, my friend, don't you know w me? 'I am Ambrose Everet, who start- it ed off from Vermont with you, years al ago!"            -  n "You don't say!" cried the pill agent, hi holding up his lantern to obtain a better re view of the retired banker. :-"Is that B1 really you?  Well, well, I am glad to bu meet you," and he grasped his old be friend's hand as he spoke, and shook it go heartily. Ve need hardly add that he lai was invited to pass the night under the roof of his former playmate.  . tel While in conversation with Mr. Ev- on eret, Dr. Gregory's partner happened of to notice the portrait which had so thl   nd much attracted Dick's notice while on irk his visit-to St. John's Square, and sud- en denly breaking the thread of his dis- ex- course, he exclaimed- lad "Why, as I live, that ic the very im- age of a person who came to my house en about seventeen years ago. An unfor- m tunate creature she was, but oh, how er handsome!" er  He now proceeded to relate how one en night, just as he was on the point of re- ly tiring to bed after a hard day's mow- ay ing, a female, in the habilirnents of ig mourning, knocked at the door, and re begged admittance, as she was suffer- mu ing.  "Of course my wife received her t. kindly," he continued, "(and made her ;s as comfortable as we could ; and after "being with us a couple of days, she gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl. f But she hardly lived long enough- to I, hear them cry. I never could discover s who she was, or where she came from. As for the children, I determined to t, raise them myself. The girl, however, ) a sweet dear little thing, was adopted t before she was a  year old by a man who said he lived in the State of New York, and unless I am greatly mistaken in this very county; his name was- -was-let me think-well, never mind, it has escaped me; that is immateri- al, however. As for the boy, having none of my own, I concluded to keep him just as long as he was willing :. remain, for he promised to be smart. But one day what should the brat do but startloff without telling me or any- body else on the farm where-he was going to,and since then I have never laid eyes on him." Harriet, who had been listening at- tentively, remembered that Dick had once mentioned how like this portrait of Emma  P---- as to Lizzie; and the idea occurred to her that perhaps.   she was this very lady's daughter, and that the lad might be the girl's own twin-brother. '- Was the person who adopted the infant named Solomon Onderdonk?" she asked with a beating heart. "That's the very name, Miss!" cried Conklin. I recollect repeating it over and over again so as not to forget it, for I felt as if I'd like to know how the little critter turned out, for she was an uncommon fine baby. But how came you to make such a good guess?" Immediately Harriet began relating what Dick had told her about the pic- ture, adding that Mr. Onderdonk had never treated Lizzie very kindly, and that once when she Was down at the old maids', where he had sent her as a punishment, the youth had rescued her from the hands of a mysterious being, who was calling her his "dear Emma!" And she ended by saying she believed Lizzie and Dick might be the same children who were born in Mr, Conk- lin's house. "Your words have awakened dark suspicions in my breast," exclaimed her father. "Who knows-but stop-it is too soon to accuse Mr. Onderdonk and the Miss Mathers of such a crime. Alexander Norris, who seduced poor Emma, went off to Australia, at least so everybody believed." "( Humph! did he have any money with him the day he started?" inquired Mr. Conklin. ( Yes, some thousands of dollars, all that remained of a large fortune which he had lost in gambling."   "Well, I wonder if he passed through Eastchester, on his way to that strange country.?" "That I do not know." "But Ellen Fowler has told me," in- terrupted Harriet, " that a gentleman from New York, named Norris, had sol- emnly promised to come to- the village and buy her father's property the day it was to be sold. And she says that he did make his appearance in East- chester early in the morning, but that suddenly he was lost sight of, and Har- vey Mather, to whom the place was mortgaged, was thus able to bid it in at a very low figure." ," Ahl " exclaimed the pill agent, "we're on the track." Just at this moment the sound of foot- steps was heard on the porch, followed in,an instant by several rapid knocks, which caused Harriet and her parent to start, for they feared Ellen might have grown suddenly worse. Indeed, the physician had told them that; in any of her violent coughing spells she might burst a blood vessel and die. They hastened to the door to see who it was seeking admission at this late hour. In an instant the door flew open, r and lo I who should they behold stand- ing before them, his face as white as a. sheet, but Dick, bearing in his arms a I fainting girl. I  "Do not lose a moment 1" he cried, fly, fly to the stone house by the creek, I and save Mis Abigail." And he had i hardly spoken these words when he fell in a swoon at their feet  .  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7736-00000068"/> CHAPTER XXIII.   TFIE night following the    one which Miss Abigail came to Liz- zie's room to put her on her guard, the latter was sitting, as usual, at the win- dow. She could distinguish nothing, however---not even a star-for, the sky was clouded, and it would have been difficult for anyone to see even his hand before his face; and the east wind as itstruck the side of the building caused {; the window-panes to rattle dismally.-  But if outside, as well as in her apart- X ment, all was obscure, it was quite other- e wise- below stairs. There we behold g Solomon  'Onderdonk and Prudence t conversing in undertones, and on the c old maid's countenance is the same w satanic expression which always caused hi her sister to shudder; while the face a of her companion ,is paler than her in own, and his voice tremulous, Her arms are crossed upon her breast, her lips, except when she is speaking, are tu pressed firmly together, and hanging down from her right hand is a stout rope.               the "I Well, Solomon,' she said, "I told you when we first undertook. this job, yol that I'd see Jit carried through to the loc end, and ' F1 keep my word, so the sooner we, begin.,the sooner 'twill be her over, and both of us breathing, freer.. lose Abbe's tears shall not influence me any mos longer."  As she spoke, she coiled the be rope up and led the way swiftly but thrc noiselessly to the cellar door, which she half opened, then holding tie- caindle in R such a  way that as much light as pos- set N sible might be thrown into the subter-: the-   on Iranean chamber, she encouraged him Liz- to descend. the  No sooner did the crazy being, who, vin- as we rememnber, was confined here ng, more than six months before, catch a iky glimpse of his figure, than he broke :en out into boisterous laughter, which, nd it was feared would arouse Abigail-- as who at this moment was asleep.-when ed {a plaster, made expressly for the pur- [y.! pose, was placed over his muuth. Then rt- rolling him over on his face, with more :r- energy than the old maid would have Id given him credit for, Mr. Onderdonk :e tied the arms of the poor victim se- te curely together, with the rope which. e was thrown  down to him, To drag d him to the ladder, was but the work of e a moment, and Solomon was about lift- r ing him up when he paused : r  "Hark 1 what's that 1" he exclaimed. "Nothing, man, nothing!  Don't  turn so white," whispered Prudence. "But I  did hear something." "'Twas only Tommy   knocking over the milk pan in the kitchen." "Are you sure?" he gasped. "Is your sister asleep? Is Lizzie's door locked, eh?" "You fool 1" said the woman, losing her temper. ." Do make haste, and not lose precious time. Remember it's al- most ten o'clock; in; six hours it will be daylight  And after we've got through with Norris, our job is only half finished." Reassured by her coolness, he now set vigorously to work, and lifting up the prisoner as if he were a feather,   '(the unfortunate creature being indeed me only skin and bone), he mounted the me ladder" and in another moment was mE following Prudence out of the house. It did not take them long to reach in the stake to which the skiff was fasten- T1 ed; then placing his burthen in the bu bottom of it, Solomon took the oars, ga and with the old maid seated in the of stern, pushed off into the stream. The in state of the tide suited their designs hi exactly, as it was about half ebb. es The oars, too, had been muffled; and al the woman, as she watched the speed they were, making down the creek,  scratched her nose with satisfaction. It had been their intention, at first, to take the girl along and make way U with her at the same time, but Solomon t feared tha t the boat was not quite large i enough to hold four; and, besides, Miss h Abigail had seemed unusually restless, and they concluded to wait until she should be in a sound slumber before s venturing into Lizzie's chamber. Twice before reaching Pelham bridge, c Mr. Onderdonk ceased rowing, and t listened attentively to hear if any other ( persons were moving about on the water. At one time he fancied a boat 7 was approaching from the Westchester side; he asked the old' maid whether she did not hear anything, his voice ' trembling so much that she was tempt- ed to box his ears. "Nobody's coming, man I" she re- plied. "But, if there were, sooner than not make a clean job of this, I'd knock a hole through the bottom of the skiff and sink us- all three just where we are. But, quick1 'row on, or, it will be morning before we get through; If you're scary, give me the oars."  Shamed into something like courage by this last remark, he' pulled on. to- wards the bridge-and in a few mo-   ments they passed it. .Theshores im- mediately widened, and the danger of meeting other boats became lessened. There were only two lights to be seen in any direction-one, the beacon at Throgg's Neck; the other, the lamp burning in the bed-room of the toll- gate-keeper's dwelling, at the west end of the bridge; and this he watched so intently, that he paid no heed at all to his boat, which came within a few inch- es of striking a huge rock that towered above the surface. "Mind yourself!" growled Prudence. "( Right hand oar, hard!" In a moment they had darted by, just grazing the seaweed and waking up a gull which flew screaming over the water. To Solomoni the bird's cry :sounded ominous, and quite unnerved him. , "How would it do," he inquired, , stopping a second time and listening, - "to put the crazy man on the outer cuby (ope of two reefs which lie close I to Locust Point, and at certain states rof the tide uncovered), and there leave e him for the water to wash him away t when it rises? We might even risk tak- r ing off the plaster, for folks ashore are  all in their beds, and wouldn't hear him :e singing, and we might also unfasten his t arms. Then, you see, when he'd be drowned, the public would call it sui- e cide. What say you?" er : "Coward l' hissed his companion. 'd ," No such half and half work for me, I he want to make a clean job I! Weak as he re is, he might swim ashore if you left him ill on the rock; or somebody might come If and rescue him, No, when he quits this bbat, it shall only be to follow this ge stone which i have tied to the end of to- the rope. It's heavy,and :will anchor n o- him safely among the lobsters and  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7736-00000069"/> sharks of the middle ground; so pull on!' He knew better than to stop and ar- gue the point, so he once more rowed as fast as he could, and soon reached a point about a mile southwest of City Island. Here there were mno oyster stakes planted, because of the depth of water; nor did sloops and' schooners make it an anchorage, it being almost in the channel, and consequently just the place  to sink their victim. "Now, easy," said Prudence. "It seems to me we're far enough from the c shore; let's stop and listen."?' And as 1 she spoke, her own heart, for the first h time since leaving the mill, began to throb violently.         tl , The Sound was very still; nothing a could be heard but the waves, as they h broke against the side of the skiff, 'dashing the spray into their faces. m "Well, slide him off!" she presently ca exclaimed, after having satisfied herself A that no other persons were near. wl In another moment there was a wl heavy plunge in the water; for an in- lat stant the surface sparkled with phos- to phorescent light, then all was black an again; and the cold drops started out so; upon Solomon's- face.       sh5 Prudence, herself, seemed to have a ed momentary compunction of conscience, coN but soon recovering her self-possession, a s her features assumed a  sardonic sfmile. to  "'You see," she said, "what a simple was job it was. Ha!, pity that I  spared the him so many years for Abbe's sake. so i Bu]t, better late than nhever; and 'no' was there'll be no fears of having our right blo( to the stone house and: mill question- bee ed." While she was speaking, her ac- T complice sat stiff and mute, while the rust boat] which was drifting with the tide, rem had already gone some distance from wise   pull the fatal spot; a fact which neither of them seemed to realize. Suddenly lar- Solomon started, and exclaimed : wed  "Good God I what is that?" point- ed a ing towards a strange-looking object City moving noiselessly over the surface within a few feet of them. "For shamne! kes scared at a buoy!" rejoined, the old- :er; maid. "If that's the way you're going e it to act every time you see anything in the thp dark, hereafter, you'd better tumble ace overboard yourself. .How will you feel when the sun rises to-morrow, and all :It Eastchester greets you? Oh, if your he chattering teeth betray the deed l" as Here. she shook her bony forefinger at rst him and muttered a curse. to  We will now leave the murderers on their way back to the creek and return ig and see what occurred, in the stone ;y house after their departure. If, For about an hour, everything re- mained quiet, with the exception of the y cat, which kept howling for its mistress. If At length its cries aroused Abigail, whose sleep had been very fit-ful, and a who made her appearance in the entry, - lamp inhand, and clad in hernightgown, ;- to see what was the matter! for, by the k animal's actions, she conjectured that t something had gone wrong. At once she opened her sister's room and look- ied in, and her heart sank when she dis- , covered that it was vacant. Then, with a sickening sensation, she hurried down to the cellar. Here the dreadful-truth was revealed; the vault was empty-- the prisoner, whose life she had tried so hard to persuade her sister to spare, was gone! and at, the thought of the bloody act which had probably already been committed, she shook with terror. Then, with a desperate energy, she rushed up the staircase again, for she remembere d that Lizzie's life was like- wise in danger. Indeed, might not   she, too, have been taken from her pris-  on and murdered? To her joy, how- th ever, she heard the girl's voice within; rig and as soon as the piece of iwood was w removed from the key-hole, the door e s was opened.            L "Ask me no questions," gasped Ab- fo be; "quick-flee at once-run to the se village as fast as you can!"  hb Lizzie did not wait to ask what these I words meant. She knew some peril menaced her; and without even stop- c ping to dress, she ran down stairs and I out into the lane. But she had not C proceeded many steps-before she began tc to reflect on her singular position. Mr. Onderdonk's hand raised against her r -Ellen and Dick no longer living where I they once did-perhaps moved to a t distant part of the country-herself 1 without a penny, where could she go I for succor? What would the world say . when they saw her robed as she was? Would they believe her story? But while these thoughts passed through her mind she came'to Gregory's cabin, and as the night was now not quite so dark, she could see that the door was wide open, and the gate torn off its hinges. Soon she reached Eastchester, but although she walked from one end of it to the other; not a solitary person did she meet. Thiis, however, was nothing remarkable, as it was nearly midnight. At last she fell in with a colored woman whom she knew, and of whom she inquired if Ellen Fowler still dwelt in the neighborhood-and if so, where. The woman kindly offered to conduct her to the house, and her ser- vices were gladly accepted.   "This is it, Miss," she said, after they had walked about a mile, " and a right nice little farm she has, too; and when Mr. Gregory comes back, if he ever does, 'twill pay him to cultivate it." Lizzie now warmly thanked her guide for going so far out of her own way to serve her-then hastened towards the house. The second knock brought Dick to the door. "Why is this you, Lizzie?" he ex- claimed, clasping her in his arms, " oh, I knew 'twas a lie-you've not been to Ohio-but tell me, what have they done to you?" glancing at her bare feet. With as calm a voice as she could com- mand, she briefly related how she had been confined in the stone house during the winter-how a horrible crime had been plotted-how Abigail, only half an hour before,'had bade her escape,and that -she was in dread lest this tender-heart- ed old maid might herself be in peril at the hands of Solomon and Prudence. She concluded by urging him to make all possible haste to rescue her. "Yes, I shall go at once," he re- plied; "but do you stay here until I s come back." "No, take me with you; take me 1 with you l" she cried. "Oh do not 1 leave me!" clinging to his arm and de- s daring they should ,never be separated again. f  Of course he could not compel her "to stay, so hand in hand they hastened, as we have already seen, to Mr. Ever- o et's-; where just as they reached the r- threshold, the girl's strength gave way and she fainted.  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7736-00000070"/> CHAPTER XXIV.   CLOUDS were still hiding the stars from view, when the boat contain- ing the murderers reached the spot near the mill, whence they had started three hours before. There was a marked difference in the appearance and demeanor of the guilty pairas they rtepped upon the bank. While the woman had become quite herself again, her companion, on the contrary, was trembling from head to foot. ,. Don't letyour teeth chatterso, manl" she whispered. "l Remember that only half our work is done." To this he made no reply, but turned  his eyes towards they horizon, as if to see whether day-light was approaching. I When they reached the house, the t old maid was not a little startled at a finding the door wide open, for she had c left it closed. It was with some feeling h of apprehension that she groped her e way to the kitchen to get the lamp z which had been left upon the table; h and having lighted it, she went up stairs tk to ascertain if all was safe; while Solo- mon threw himself into the nearest O chair and groaned audibly.    a "What now, Abbe! What's the mat- T ter, woman?"' she exclaimed, when, on ,fri reaching the top of the stair-case, she "  beheld her sister lying prostrate on the we floor. It was some moments before If the poor creature could respond to this ca inquiry, so enervated had she become sta on the return of her sister and Solo- ant mon Onderdonk from such an errand   ars of wickedness; but at length, summon. tin- ing all the energy she could command, lot, she exclaimed:; ed  "The girl is safe; do what you please with me!"   ;a. .  . in  Mr Onderdonk, actuated either by he fear of being left alone, or curiosity to he witness the interview between the sis- ters, soon joined his accomplice; when te Abbe informed him that his daughter he had escaped, and gone to arouse the to people of the village. "OO Lord!" he gasped, s we are un- !" done! I knew you would betray us i" y And as he spoke he clenched his fists and stamped his foot frightfully near d the head of the prostrate woman. " Prudence repaired in haste to the  prison-chamber,.with a view of testing e the truth of .her sister's declaration, t and made diligent search for the object of her nefarious designs, but finding her sister's words verified, she return- ed to the lower floor in a perfect fren- zy, exclaiming, as her eyes fell upon her participant in the awful tragedy that had been enacted      - "Yes, Solomon, our hour has come 1 Oh, Abbe, Abbe! little good shall it avail you. Our fate shall be yours." Then addressing herself to her male friend, she said in a more subdued tone "Solomon, stay here an instant and watch her-I mustgo below and listen If they're not coming, we may yet es- cape. And thus saying, she ran down stairs, leaving him wringing his hands and sobbing like a child. "Wretch!" said Abigail, as soon as   she found herself alone with him, "you'll not escape punishment-you deserve the gibbet, and no doubt will get your deserts!" So enraged was he at these words, that he brought his right foot down with fearful force upon the head of the prostrate woman, depriving her, for several moments, of consciousness. Prudence now came rushing back- laughing wildly, and with arms ex- tended-- "I hear 'em-I hear 'emr!" she shrieked, " they're coming-ha! ha! I don't care now-ha! ha! We three will be warm enough to-night--ha! ha! -don't you hear it?" Mr. Onderdonk, half paralyzed with fear, fancied he heard a curious sound below, and there was a smell like that of burning wood. "My God, you've set the house on fire," he cried. ' This was literally true. Already the smioke was beginning to curl'up the stair-case, to the franiitic delight of Pru- dence, and the dismay of her compan- ion in crime. " Roasting ain't as bad as hanging!" she exclaimed. "No, you shan't get away," she continued, grasp- ing him by the waist as he turned to escape. "No Solomon, we musn't sep- arate now-we shall go to perdition to- gether, ha, ha! "He struggled, but she held him as in a vise. "The door below is locked," she vociferated, "and the key is in my pocket. Ha! ha 1" "Let me go!" he screamed, savagely biting at her arm. "If it hadn't been for you and your cursed brother I'd never have got into this fix." "Don't lie, man---don't lie ! 'Twas you who put it into our heads. Ha! see, the flames are close to us." For several moments there was a mortal struggle between them, but the   woman's strength prevailed--although, in her efforts to preserve her hold on his waist, she was unable to defend her arms and face from his teeth and nails. In another moment her voice changed from railings and expressions of demo- niacal joy to those of anguish. The sparks had reached her gown, and it was soon in a blaze. Still she clung to Solomon bravely. Higher and higher the flames were rising. Her agony was. indescribable; and summoning all her energies, she pushed him before her to- wards the stair-case; then, with one mad scream, she fell with him into the burning mass beneath. At this fearful juncture, Mr. Everet and Jeremiah Conklin reached the scene, and in the light of the confla- gration they could distinguish the figure of a woman, halfway out of one of the second story windows. It was Abigail; who, as they approached, implored them to save her. Procuring a ladder, the pill agent boldly mountedl it, and' with much difficulty rescued the poor creature from her perilous situation; not, however, in time to prevent her from being fatally injured. Shortly after her rescue, the roof of the building fell in with a loud crash, and the flames shot up heavenward, lighting up the landscape, and present- ing .a magnificent spectacle. The flames, in their mad fury, seemed to be avenging the persecutions inflicted upon the victims of mercenary aspirations and demoniacal hate, and in a brief pe- riod naught remained of the stone house but its blackened walls. Abbe, in a perfectly helpless condi- tion, was conveyed to Mr. Everet's ! house, where Dick, Harriet and Lizzie immediately gathered around her and did. all in their power to alleviate her sufferings. A physician was summoa-  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7736-00000071"/> ed to the bed-side of the sufferer, but her injuries were pronounced of a fatal character and as probable to termnin- ate life in a few hours. Nevertheless, she summoned sufficient, strength to make a full confession of all she knew in relation to the crazy man, who for so long a time had, been confined in the Northeast room. It seems that on the day when Ger- rard Fowler's farm was sold under the decree of foreclosure, Alexander Norris, who had come prepared to buy it, in compliance with his promise to Ellen, was enticed, by Harvey Mather and ] Solomon Onderdonk, into the woods 1 skirting mill-lane, where he was seized, 1 gagged, and carried to the creek, That night he would have been murdered, r outright,. had not Abigail's entreaties 1i induced Prudence and her brother to p spare his life.          o She related, too, how her sister and ii Mr. Onderdonk had conspired against fe Lizzie, whose thin hand she frequently, fl   at pressed to her parched lips as she spoke. il  She then asked to see Ellen Fowler, i- and when informed that the young wo- s, man was ill, and not able to be pres- o ent, she begged .Mr. Everet to bring, v as quickly as possible, pen ink and pa- o per, as she wanted to make a will. Al- e though not a lawyer, the retired banker was competent to draw up the required - instrument in legal form, by the terms : of which the property on Hutchison's , Creek was bequeathed to the miller's daughter. And after Abbe had signed her name to it, her mental sufferings ap- peared to diminish. A heavy load had been taken off her conscience, and she felt resigned to die. The exertion of speaking proved too much for the little strength that was left her, and she fell into a state of stu- por. At length her eyes grew fixed up. on the ceiling, her fingers ceased pluck ing the quilt, and when the clock struck four in the morning, her spirit took its flight to the other world.   [CHAPTER XXV.   AN eventful morning in the history t1 of Dick's life, as well as that of 1 Lizzie, was the one which followed the 1 death of Abigail. An early breakfast was just over, and 3 the youth was about returning to El- len's, accompanied by the girl, when Harriet rushed into the parlor, and drawing up a chair, placed herself be- tween them, and bade them both sit down a moment, as she had something to communicate of the highest impor- tance to them personally. "You love Lizzie dearly, do you not?" she asked, addressing Dick, who, however, made no reply, but remained gazing fondly on Solomon's daughter, whose face was all in a glow. "Well, you ought to love her, and with all your heart, too,' she continued, smil- ing, " for she is your own twin-sister." The expression of incredulity and of astonishment which was depicted on Dick's countenance, and on that of the girl, when they heard this, is beyond our power to describe. Presently, however, Mr. Conklin ap- peared, and placing himself beside them, related all he knew of their his- tory. He told Dick, whom he had fully recognized the evening previously, that he it was from whom he (Dick) had ab- sconded when he was only nine years old, and congratulated him on having become such a fine, smart-looking fel- low. After Dick had scrutinized his fea- tures for a while, he became convinced   that the pill-vender was no other than his former employer, and so expressed his conviction. "And ain't you glad you've found your sister?" continued Jeremiah, as he noticed that one of Lizzie's hands was clasped in that of her brother. "Of course I am," responded Dick, leaning towards his sister and giving her a cordial embrace. "I must accompany you to Ellen's," said Harriet, after a pause, "-for there is something highly important to corn, municate .to her also." The revelations already made to the youth served to almost stupefy him, and the announcement that still further mys- teries were to be unfolded excited both his wonder and curiosity. ("But whatever it is," he said to him- self, "'twon't upset me as much as this has." In a few moments a vehicle was at the door, into which he mounted with Lizzie and Harriet, while in another one, close behind, followed Mr. Everet and his friend.   When they reached Eastchester they found the whole place in commotion. Groops of people were standi ng in the middle of the street, and in front of the t tavern; some gesticulating, some listen- ing, with countenances as solemn as judges; while others seemed to be in , great glee. It was evident that the - burning of the stone house had proved a perfect godsend to the gossips of the t- township, who had assembled the whole i population, around them in order to  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7736-00000072"/> compare notes, make conjectures as to the cause of the conflagration; and, in fact to relieve themselves of much pent up bile. Mr. Everet bade Dick continue on to Ellen's, as himself and Mr. Conklin intended to remain here a while in order to go before a justice of the peace, and make a statement of what i they knew concerning the recent catas- t trophe, and also to summon a coroner to hold an inquest overAbigail's body. t "Well, ain't so sorry that it's hap- c pened!" exclaimed a withered crone, s haranguing a knot of congenial spirits. et "I don't know that witches exist now- wm a-days; but if they do, then I say Pru- es dence Mather was one."      po "That's so l" chimed half a dozen voices at once.  "And Solomon On- the derdonk," continued the same speaker, drc "was no such saint as folks thought he arr was. But who knows anything of Miss cha Abigail Is she dead yet? I did hear Dic say she was lying burnt at Everet's an house."              whir "Poor Abbe!" exclaimed a  number coui of villagers. "She was a  good deal cons better than her sister, for she never gueE joined her in trying toprejudice people and against Ellen Fowler."       Sh: Just as this was said, Mr. Everet deatd reached the group, and was at once re- derd' cognized {and greeted with cries of Abig "Tell us all about this matter, Mr. ofhe Everet!"             care   It was with no small difficulty that tion v he was able to force a passage for his groun team up to the Justice's office, and Pre while engaged with that functionary, and tt the crowd kept increasing, till at length, " Ye on his re-appearance in the street, it mured had become so dense that he found it maling utterly impossible to reach his carriage, and th; Thanks, however, to the shrewd Jere- upon ii   s as to miah, who persuaded the people that tnd, in if they .would make room, his friend h pent would favor them with a few remarks, the retired banker escaped a severe Je on crushing. And when he stood upright ,nklin in his carriage, and opened his lips, the le in silence was profound. F the Afr. Everet, however, merely spoke what for a minute or two, and then g ive way atas- to Mr. Conklin, who was a much more oner fluent speaker, and when the latter ody. took the stand he was greeted with:ro- hap- ciferous cheers, for the eager crowd one, seemed to be convinced that he was rits. endowed with the caia ver-borzw, and ow- would satisfy their curiosity to the full- ?ru- est extent. And they were not disap- pointed. zen  Having transacted their business in )n- the village, Mr. Everet and his friend er, drove on to Ellen Fowler's, and on their he arrival found the invalid in a rocking. ss chair, attended by Harriet, Lizzie and ar Dick. She was just recovering from t's an unusually severe fit of coughing, which had so enfeebled her that she or could not speak. She manifested her l1 consciousness of the presence of her r guests. however, by a- pleasant smile eand a motion of the hands. She had already been told of the t death of the old maids, and Mr. On- derdonk, as well as of the will by which Abigail had restored to 'her the home of her childhood. But why should she care now for broad acres, when her por- tion would soon be a narrow plot of ground in the church yard? Presently however her lips moved, and the hectic flush grew deeper. "Yes, he shall have it all 1" she mur- mured. "  His pills may not succeed in making him as rich as he anticipates, and this will do for him to fall back upon in case of need."   CHAPTER XXVI.   T EN days have elapsed since the burn- ing of the old maids' home. With scarcely a single glance 'at the lovely scenery around him, but driving along the Boston post road towards Eastches- ter, at as rapid a rate as his nag can trot, and with an expression of intense eagerness on his 'face, behold the re- doubtable hero of our story. He may be a shade paler than when we met him last, but he certainly ap- pears more genteel in his new suit of clothes and-well-polished boots. "Ha! what fun 'twill be to see Solo- mon and Prudence biting their lips!" he soliloquized, as he shifted the reins from one hand to the other, in order to crack all his knuckles. "And how the village folks will wonder where I got my money from 1' Truly, there is nothing like humbug, say what you will." Then leaning forward to get a better view through the branches of the elms which stretched across the road- "Yes'," he continued, gently touch- ing his horse with the whip, " that must be the house; they told me it stood close to the turnpike, and had a couple of cedars near the entrance." Presently he turned off from the highway and passed through the gate, which stood wide open; and, as his wagon rolled along, his heart beat quicker, for now at last he was near his beloved. 9"Lots of tracks," he said, noticing a number of hoof marks in the lane. "I dare say Richard often takes her out   driving; what a good fellow he is." In a brief period he arrived at the new home of his betrothed. Scarcely waiting for the vehicle to stop, he sprang to the ground, then up the toop and knocked loudly at the door. "If Richard's reading the most in- teresting book in the world, he'll surely hear that," he said, grinning and stamp- ing his feet impatiently. After waiting a second ortwo-which appeared like an h6ur to him-the door slowly, almost solemnly, opened, and a long-featured individual,' with specta- cles, presented himself, and glqancing at him an instant, remarked: t Brought the coffin, I suppose?" It was all the undertaker said; at least Nat heard no more, for in an in- stant he was seized .with vertigo and sank to the floor. On returning to- consciousness, he saw Dick standing before him, weeping bitterly, and well might he lament El- len's loss, for she had been like a moth- ; er to him. , "Where is she?" inquired Gregory, in a subdued tone. Without speaking a word, the lad led the way up to the second story, where he stopped and pointed towards one of the rooms. For a moment the young man re- mained with his hand on the knob, dreading to enter; and in that brief space, oh, what thoughts rushed upon himm! Ellen, whom he had so tenderly loved, and to whom he expected soon  &#xD;<pb n="144" xml:id="VAC7736-00000073"/> to be united in the holy bonds of mat- rimony, was no longer of the earth. Another step, and he would gaze upon her lifeless corpse. But when, finally, he summoned courage to enter, and saw the pallid 1 face, the hands crossed on the breast, the wreath of flowers on the pillow, he calmly advanced to the bedside, and there assumed a kneeling posture, which he maintained for several min- uteS, and until the func 'al services were about to commence--when, rising, and without opening his lips or even look- ing up, he hurriedly left the chamber,  dashed down stairs, not noticing Dick, who vainly endeavored to catch his arm as he rushed past. "Don't abandon me!" cried the  youth, following and overtaking him  , just as he reached the gate.  "No, Richard, no I But for a while I must be left alone," answered Grego-  ry in a hollow voice.  But whither he was going he cared t not; everything seemed to him in a state of chaos, and he continued on, as b it were blindly, till he found himself in  the vicinity of the deserted cabin. a Here let us leave him, seated on the 1] threshold of his former home; his eyes P fixed upon the path, now overgrown i with weeds, and which Ellen had so t1 often trodden-the scene, in a word, of h so many joyous moments to all the in- h &amp;   - mates of the humble abode in former years. A few words more and our story is ended. When Dick found that Lizzie was his sister, he allowed the admiration which he had always entertained for Harriet Everet to ripen into love; and it is scarcely nces- sary to add that, ere long, they weie mar- ried. Of course the world could say noth- ing against this union, when it learned that the youth was the legitimate son of Alex- ander Norris. James Merryweathcr, in time, became resigned to the loss of the prize he had so much coveted, and was more successful in winning the affections of the black-eyed Lizzie. Mrs. Merryweather-disgusted with the world-became a Shaker, and went to dwell in Lebanon; where, it is said, she died shortly after, of an affection of the spleen. Mr. Everet remained a widower-a healthy and happy one-and ended his days with his son-in-law, who had wisely concluded to spend only four months of the year in the city, and the other eight on the farm. Nat Gregory, tQ whom Ellen Fowler had bequeathed her property on Hutehison's creek, instead of rebuilding the stone house, allowed the bats to occupy the ruins; and having instructed Dick to keep the taxes paid, took his departure for the West. Whether or not he be still among the liv- ing, is more than we can tell. According to last accounts, he was said to be worth his million, making everybody glad around him, but himself not a happy man.   THE END.   &#xD;</p>
