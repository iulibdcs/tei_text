            <opener>
               <salute>MY DEAR BRIDGE:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SOME of the more crabbed of my critics, I understand, have pronounced your friend
               egotistical, indiscreet, and even impertinent, on account of the Prefaces and
               Introductions with which, on several occasions, he has seen fit to pave the reader's
               way into the interior edifice of a book. In the justice of this censure I do not
               exactly concur, for the reasons, on the one hand, that the public generally has
               negatived the idea of undue freedom on the author's part, by evincing, it seems to
               me, rather more interest in these aforesaid Introductions than in the stories which
               followed,—and that, on the other hand, with whatever appearance of confidential
               intimacy, I have been especially careful to make no disclosures respecting myself
               which the most indifferent observer might not have been acquainted with, and which I
               was not perfectly willing that my worst enemy should know. I might further justify
               myself, on the plea that, ever since my youth, I have been addressing a very limited
               circle of friendly readers, without much danger of being overheard by the public at
               large; and that the habits thus acquired might pardonably continue, although
               strangers may have begun to mingle with my audience.</p>
            <p>But the charge, I am bold to say, is not a reasonable one, in any view which we can
               fairly take of it. There is no harm, but, on the contrary, good, in arraying some of
               the ordinary facts of life in a slightly idealized and artistic guise. I have taken
               facts which relate to myself, because they chance to be nearest at hand, and likewise
               are my own property. And, as<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6669-00000003"/> for egotism, a
               person, who has been burrowing, to his utmost ability, into the depths of our common
               nature, for the purposes of psychological romance,—and who pursues his researches in
               that dusky region, as he needs must, as well by the tact of sympathy as by the light
               of observation,—will smile at incurring such an imputation in virtue of a little
               preliminary talk about his external habits, his abode, his casual associates, and
               other matters entirely upon the surface. These things hide the man, instead of
               displaying him. You must make quite another kind of inquest, and look through the
               whole range of his fictitious characters, good and evil, in order to detect any of
               his essential traits.</p>
            <p>Be all this as it may, there can be no question as to the propriety of my inscribing
               this volume of earlier and later sketches to you, and pausing here, a few moments, to
               speak of them, as friend speaks to friend; still being cautions, however, that the
               public and the critics shall overhear nothing which we care about concealing. On you,
               if on no other person, I am entitled to rely, to sustain the position of my
               Dedicatee. If anybody is responsible for my being at this day an author, it is
               yourself. I know not whence your faith came; but, while we were lads together at a
               country college,—gathering blue-berries, in study-hours, under those tall academic
               pines; or watching the great logs, as they tumbled along the current of the
               Androscoggin; or shooting pigeons and gray squirrels in the woods; or bat-fowling in
               the summer twilight; or catching trouts in that shadowy little stream which, I
               suppose, is still wandering riverward through the forest,—though you and I will never
               cast a line in it again,—two idle lads, in short (as we need not fear to acknowledge
               now), doing a hundred things that the Faculty never heard of, or else it had been the
               worse for us,—still it was your prognostic of your friend's destiny, that he was to
               be a writer of fiction.</p>
            <p>And a fiction-monger, in due season, he became. But, was there ever such a weary
               delay in obtaining the slightest recognition from the public, as in my case? I sat
               down by the wayside side of life, like a man under enchantment, and a shrubbery
               sprung up around me, and the bushes grew to be saplings, and the saplings became
               trees, until no exit appeared possible, through the entangling depths of my
               obscurity. And there, perhaps, I should be sitting at this moment, with the moss on
               the imprisoning tree-trunks, and the yellow leaves of more than a score of autumns
               piled above me, if it had not been for you. For it was through your
               interposition,—and that, moreover, unknown to himself,—that your early friend was
               brought before the public, somewhat more prominently than theretofore, in the first
               volume of Twice-told Tales. Not a publisher in America, I presume, would have thought
               well enough of my forgotten or never noticed stories, to risk the expense of print
               and paper; nor do I say this with any purpose of casting odium on the respectable
               fraternity of book-sellers, for their blindness to my wonderful merit. To confess the
               truth, I doubted of the public recognition quite as much as they could do. So much
               the more generous was your confidence; and knowing, as I do, that it was founded on
               old friendship rather than cold criticism, I value it only the more for that.</p>
            <p>So, now, when I turn back upon my path, lighted by a transitory gleam of public
               favor, to pick up a few articles which were left out of my former collections, I take
               pleasure in making them the memorial of our very long and unbroken connection. Some
               of these sketches were among the earliest that I wrote, and, after lying for years in
               manuscript, they at last skulked into the Annuals or Magazines, and have hidden
               themselves there ever since. Others were the productions of a later period; others,
               again, were written recently. The comparison of these various trifles—the indices of
               intellectual condition at far separated epochs—affects me with a singular complexity
               of regrets. I am disposed to quarrel with the earlier sketches, both because a mature
               judgment discerns so many faults, and still more because they come so nearly up to
               the standard of the best that I can achieve now. The ripened autumnal fruit tastes
               but little better than the early windfalls.<pb n="10-11 (Table of Contents) "
                  xml:id="VAC6669-00000004"/> It would, indeed, be mortifying to believe that the
               summertime of life has passed away, without any greater progress and improvement than
               is indicated here. But,—at least, so I would fain hope,—these things are scarcely to
               be depended upon, as measures of the intellectual and moral man. In youth, men are
               apt to write more wisely than they really know or feel; and the remainder of life may
               be not idly spent in realizing and convincing themselves of the wisdom which they
               uttered long ago. The truth that was only in the fancy then may have since become a
               substance in the mind and heart.</p>
            <p>I have nothing further, I think, to say; unless it be that the public need not dread
               my again trespassing on its kindness, with any more of these musty and mouse-nibbled
               leaves of old periodicals, transformed, by the magic arts of my friendly publishers,
               into a new book. These are the last. Or, if a few still remain, they are either such
               as no paternal partiality could induce the author to think worth preserving, or else
               they have got into some very dark and dusty hiding-place, quite out of my own
               remembrance and whence no researches can avail to unearth them. So there let them
               rest.</p>

               <head type="sub">A CHILDISH MIRACLE.</head>
               <p>ONE afternoon of a cold winter's day, when the sun shone forth with chilly
                  brightness, after a long storm, two children asked leave of their mother to run
                  out and play in the new-fallen snow. The elder child was a little girl, whom,
                  because she was of a tender and modest disposition, and was thought to be very
                  beautiful, her parents, and other people who were familiar with her, used to call
                  Violet. But her brother was known by the style and title of Peony, on account of
                  the ruddiness of his broad and round little phiz, which made everybody think of
                  sunshine and great scarlet flowers. The father of these two children, a certain
                  Mr. Lindsey, it is important to say, was an excellent but exceedingly
                  matter-of-fact sort of man, a dealer in hardware, and was sturdily accustomed to
                  take what is called the common-sense view of all matters that came under his
                  consideration. With a heart about as tender as other people's, he had a head as
                  hard and impenetrable, and therefore, perhaps, as empty, as one of the iron pots
                  which it was a part of his business to sell. The mother's character, on the other
                  hand, had a strain of poetry in it, a trait of unworldly beauty,—a<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000006"/> delicate and dewy flower, as it were, that had
                  survived out of her imaginative youth, and still kept itself alive amid the dusty
                  realities of matrimony and motherhood.</p>
               <p>So, Violet and Peony, as I began with saying, besought their mother to let them
                  run out and play in the new snow; for, though it had looked so dreary and dismal,
                  drifting downward out of the gray sky, it had a very cheerful aspect, now that the
                  sun was shining on it. The children dwelt in a city, and had no wider play-place
                  than a little garden before the house, divided by a white fence from the street,
                  and with a pear-tree and two or three plum-trees over-shadowing it, and some
                  rose-bushes just in front of the parlor windows. The trees and shrubs, however,
                  were now leafless, and their twigs were enveloped in the light snow, which thus
                  made a kind of wintry foliage, with here and there a pendent icicle for the
                  fruit.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Violet,—yes, my little Peony," said their kind mother; "you may go out and
                  play in the new snow."</p>
               <p>Accordingly, the good lady bundled up her darlings in woollen jackets and wadded
                  sacks, and put comforters round their necks, and a pair of striped gaiters on each
                  little pair of legs, and worsted mittens on their hands, and gave them a kiss
                  apiece, by way of a spell to keep away Jack Frost. Forth sallied the two children,
                  with a hop-skip-and-jump, that carried them at once into the very heart of a huge
                  snow-drift, whence Violet emerged like a snow-bunting, while little Peony
                  floundered out with his round face in full bloom. Then what a merry time had they!
                  To look at them, frolicking in the wintry garden, you would have thought that the
                  dark and pitiless storm had been sent for no other purpose but to provide a new
                  plaything for Violet and Peony; and that they themselves had been created, as the
                  snow-birds were, to take delight only in the tempest, and in the white mantle
                  which it spread over the earth.</p>
               <p>At last, when they had frosted one another all over with handfuls of snow, Violet,
                  after laughing heartily at little Peony's figure, was struck with a new idea.</p>
               <p>"You look exactly like a snow-image, Peony," said she, "if your cheeks were not so
                  red. And that puts me in mind! Let us make an image out of snow,—an image of a
                  little girl,—and it shall be our sister, and shall run about and play with us all
                  winter long. Won't it be nice?"</p>
               <p>"O, yes!" cried Peony, as plainly as he could speak, for he was but a little boy.
                  "That will be nice! And mamma shall see it!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," answered Violet; "mamma shall see the new little girl. But she must not
                  make her come into the warm parlor; for, you know, our little snow-sister will not
                  love the warmth."</p>
               <p>And forthwith the children began this great business of making a snow-image that
                  should run about; while their mother, who was sitting at the window and over-heard
                  some of their talk, could not help smiling at the gravity with which they set
                  about it. They really seemed to imagine that there would be no difficulty whatever
                  in creating a live little girl out of the snow. And, to say the truth, if miracles
                  are ever to be wrought, it will be by putting our hands to the work in precisely
                  such a simple and undoubting frame of mind as that in which Violet and Peony now
                  undertook to perform one,<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6669-00000007"/> without so much
                  as knowing that it was a miracle. So thought the mother; and thought, likewise,
                  that the new snow, just fallen from heaven, would be excellent material to make
                  new beings of, if it were not so very cold. She gazed at the children a moment
                  longer, delighting to watch their little figures,—the girl, tall for her age,
                  graceful and agile, and so delicately colored that she looked like a cheerful
                  thought, more than a physical reality,—while Peony expanded in breadth rather than
                  height, and rolled along on his short and sturdy legs, as substantial as an
                  elephant, though not quite so big. Then the mother resumed her work. What it was I
                  forget; but she was either trimming a silken bonnet for Violet, or darning a pair
                  of stockings for little Peony's short legs. Again, however, and again, and yet
                  other agains, she could not help turning her head to the window, to see how the
                  children got on with their snow-image.</p>
               <p>Indeed, it was an exceedingly pleasant sight, those bright little souls at their
                  tasks! Moreover, it was really wonderful to observe how knowingly and skilfully
                  they managed the matter. Violet assumed the chief direction, and told Peony what
                  to do, while, with her own delicate fingers, she shaped out all the nicer parts of
                  the snow-figure. It seemed, in fact, not so much to be made by the children, as to
                  grow up under their hands, while they were playing and prattling about it. Their
                  mother was quite surprised at this; and the longer she looked, the more and more
                  surprised she grew.</p>
               <p>"What remarkable children mine are!" thought she, smiling with a mother's pride;
                  and smiling at herself, too, for being so proud of them. "What other children
                  could have made anything so like a little girl's figure out of snow, at the first
                  trial? Well;—but now I must finish Peony's new frock, for his grandfather is
                  coming to-morrow, and I want the little fellow to look handsome."</p>
               <p>So she took up the frock, and was soon as busily at work again with her needle as
                  the two children with their snow-image. But still, as the needle travelled hither
                  and thither through the seams of the dress, the mother made her toil light and
                  happy by listening to the airy voices of Violet and Peony. They kept talking to
                  one another all the time, their tongues being quite as active as their feet and
                  hands. Except at intervals, she could not distinctly hear what was said, but had
                  merely a sweet impression that they were in a most loving mood, and were enjoying
                  themselves highly, and that the business of making the snow-image went
                  prosperously on. Now and then, however, when Violet and Peony happened to raise
                  their voices, the words were as audible as if they had been spoken in the very
                  parlor, where the mother sat. O, how delightfully those words echoed in her heart,
                  even though they meant nothing so very wise or wonderful, after all!</p>
               <p>But you must know a mother listens with her heart, much more than with her ears;
                  and thus she is often delighted with the trills of celestial music, when other
                  people can hear nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>"Peony, Peony!" cried Violet to her brother, who had gone to another part of the
                  garden, "bring me some of that fresh snow, Peony, from the very furthest corner,
                  where we have not been trampling. I want it to shape<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000008"/> our little snow-sister's bosom with. You know that
                  part must be quite pure, just as it came out of the sky!"</p>
               <p>"Here it is, Violet!" answered Peony, in his bluff tone,—but a very sweet tone,
                  too,—as he came floundering through the half-trodden drifts. "Here is the snow for
                  her little bosom. O, Violet, how beau-ti-ful she begins to look!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Violet, thoughtfully and quietly; "our snow-sister does look very
                  lovely. I did not quite know, Peony, that we could make such a sweet little girl
                  as this."</p>
               <p>The mother, as she listened, thought how fit and delightful an incident it would
                  be, if fairies, or, still better, if angel-children were to come from paradise,
                  and play invisibly with her own darlings, and help them to make their snow-image,
                  giving it the features of celestial babyhood! Violet and Peony would not be aware
                  of their immortal playmates,—only they would see that the image grew very
                  beautiful while they worked at it, and would think that they themselves had done
                  it all.</p>
               <p>"My little girl and boy deserve such playmates, if mortal children ever did!" said
                  the mother to herself; and then she smiled again at her own motherly pride.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, the idea seized upon her imagination; and, ever and anon, she took a
                  glimpse out of the window, half dreaming that she might see the golden-haired
                  children of paradise sporting with her own golden-haired Violet and bright-cheeked
                  Peony.</p>
               <p>Now, for a few moments, there was a busy and earnest, but indistinct hum of the
                  two children's voices, as Violet and Peony wrought together with one happy
                  consent. Violet still seemed to be the guiding spirit; while Peony acted rather as
                  a laborer, and brought her the snow from far and near. And yet the little urchin
                  evidently had a proper understanding of the matter, too!</p>
               <p>"Peony, Peony!" cried Violet; for her brother was again at the other side of the
                  garden. "Bring me those light wreaths of snow that have rested on the lower
                  branches of the pear-tree. You can clamber on the snow-drift, Peony, and reach
                  them easily. I must have them to make some ringlets for our snow-sister's
                  head!"</p>
               <p>"Here they are, Violet!" answered the little boy. "Take care you do not break
                  them. Well done! Well done! How pretty!"</p>
               <p>"Does she not look sweetly?" said Violet, with a very satisfied tone; "and now we
                  must have some little shining bits of ice, to make the brightness of her eyes. She
                  is not finished yet. Mamma will see how very beautiful she is; but papa will say,
                  'Tush! nonsense!—come in out of the cold!'"</p>
               <p>"Let us call mamma to look out," said Peony; and then he shouted lustily, "Mamma!
                  mamma!! mamma!!! Look out, and see what a nice 'ittle girl we are making!"</p>
               <p>The mother put down her work, for an instant, and looked out of the window. But it
                  so happened that the sun—for this was one of the shortest days of the whole
                  year—had sunken so nearly to the edge of the world that his setting shine came
                  obliquely into the lady's eyes. So she was dazzled, you must understand, and could
                  not very distinctly observe what was in the garden. Still, however, through all
                  that bright, blinding dazzle of the sun and the new snow, she beheld a small white
                     figure<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6669-00000009"/> in the garden, that seemed to
                  have a wonderful deal of human likeness about it. And she saw Violet and
                  Peony,—indeed, she looked more at them than at the image,—she saw the two children
                  still at work; Peony bringing fresh snow, and Violet applying it to the figure as
                  scientifically as a sculptor adds clay to his model. Indistinctly as she discerned
                  the snow-child, the mother thought to herself that never before was there a
                  snow-figure so cunningly made, nor ever such a dear little girl and boy to make
                  it.</p>
               <p>"They do everything better than other children," said she, very complacently. "No
                  wonder they make better snow-images!"</p>
               <p>She sat down again to her work, and made as much haste with it as possible;
                  because twilight would soon come, and Peony's frock was not yet finished, and
                  grandfather was expected, by railroad, pretty early in the morning. Faster and
                  faster, therefore, went her flying fingers. The children, likewise, kept busily at
                  work in the garden, and still the mother listened, whenever she could catch a
                  word. She was amused to observe how their little imaginations had got mixed up
                  with what they were doing, and were carried away by it. They seemed positively to
                  think that the snow-child would run about and play with them.</p>
               <p>"What a nice playmate she will be for us, all winter long!" said Violet. "I hope
                  papa will not be afraid of her giving us a cold! Shan't you love her dearly,
                  Peony?"</p>
               <p>"O, yes!" cried Peony. "And I will hug her, and she shall sit down close by me,
                  and drink some of my warm milk!"</p>
               <p>"O no, Peony!" answered Violet, with grave wisdom. "That will not do at all. Warm
                  milk will not be wholesome for our little snow-sister. Little snow-people, like
                  her, eat nothing but icicles. No, no, Peony; we must not give her anything warm to
                  drink!"</p>
               <p>There was a minute or two of silence; for Peony, whose short legs were never
                  weary, had gone on a pilgrimage again to the other side of the garden. All of a
                  sudden, Violet cried out, loudly and joyfully,</p>
               <p>"Look here, Peony! Come quickly! A light has been shining on her cheek out of that
                  rose-colored cloud! and the color does not go away! Is not that beautiful?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; it is beau-ti-ful," answered Peony, pronouncing the three syllables with
                  deliberate accuracy. "O, Violet, only look at her hair! It is all like gold!"</p>
               <p>"O, certainly," said Violet, with tranquillity, as if it were very much a matter
                  of course. "That color, you know, comes from the golden clouds, that we see up
                  there in the sky. She is almost finished now. But her lips must be made very
                  red,—redder than her cheeks. Perhaps, Peony, it will make them red, if we both
                  kiss them!"</p>
               <p>Accordingly, the mother heard two smart little smacks, as if both her children
                  were kissing the snow-image on its frozen mouth. But, as this did not seem to make
                  the lips quite red enough, Violet next proposed that the snow-child should be
                  invited to kiss Peony's scarlet cheek.</p>
               <p>"Come, 'ittle snow-sister, kiss me!" cried Peony.</p>
               <p>"There! she has kissed you," added Violet, "and<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000010"/> now her lips are very red. And she blushed a
                  little, too!"</p>
               <p>"O, what a cold kiss!" cried Peony.</p>
               <p>Just then, there came a breeze of the pure west wind, sweeping through the garden
                  and rattling the parlor windows. It sounded so wintry cold, that the mother was
                  about to tap on the window-pane with her thimbled finger, to summon the two
                  children in, when they both cried out to her with one voice. The tone was not a
                  tone of surprise, although they were evidently a good deal excited; it appeared
                  rather as if they were very much rejoiced at some event that had now happened, but
                  which they had been looking for, and had reckoned upon all along.</p>
               <p>"Mamma! mamma! We have finished our little snow-sister, and she is running about
                  the garden with us!"</p>
               <p>"What imaginative little beings my children are!" thought the mother, putting the
                  last few stitches into Peony's frock. "And it is strange, too, that they make me
                  almost as much a child as they themselves are! I can hardly help believing, now,
                  that the snow-image has really come to life!"</p>
               <p>"Dear mamma!" cried Violet, "pray look out, and see what a sweet playmate we
                  have!"</p>
               <p>The mother, being thus entreated, could no longer delay to look forth from the
                  window. The sun was now gone out of the sky, leaving, however, a rich inheritance
                  of his brightness among those purple and golden clouds which make the sunsets of
                  winter so magnificent. But there was not the slightest gleam or dazzle, either on
                  the window or on the snow; so that the good lady could look all over the garden,
                  and see everything and everybody in it. And what do you think she saw there?
                  Violet and Peony, of course, her own two darling children. Ah, but whom or what
                  did she besides? Why, if you will believe me, there was a small figure of a girl,
                  dressed all in white, with rose-tinged cheeks and ringlets of golden hue, playing
                  about the garden with the two children! A stranger though she was, the child
                  seemed to be on as familiar terms with Violet and Peony, and they with her, as if
                  all the three had been playmates during the whole of their little lives. The
                  mother thought to herself that it must certainly be the daughter of one of the
                  neighbors, and that, seeing Violet and Peony in the garden, the child had run
                  across the street to play with them. So this kind lady went to the door, intending
                  to invite the little runaway into her comfortable parlor; for, now that the
                  sunshine was withdrawn, the atmosphere, out of doors, was already growing very
                  cold.</p>
               <p>But, after opening the house-door, she stood an instant on the threshold,
                  hesitating whether she ought to ask the child to come in, or whether she should
                  even speak to her. Indeed, she almost doubted whether it were a real child, after
                  all, or only a light wreath of the new-fallen snow, blown hither and thither about
                  the garden by the intensely cold west wind. There was certainly something very
                  singular in the aspect of the little stranger. Among all the children of the
                  neighborhood, the lady could remember no such face, with its pure white, and
                  delicate rose-color, and the golden ringlets tossing about the forehead and
                  cheeks. And as for her dress, which was entirely of white, and fluttering in the
                  breeze, it was<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6669-00000011"/> such as no reasonable
                  woman would put upon a little girl, when sending her out to play, in the depth of
                  winter. It made this kind and careful mother shiver only to look at those small
                  feet, with nothing in the world on them, except a very thin pair of white
                  slippers. Nevertheless, airily as she was clad, the child seemed to feel not the
                  slightest inconvenience from the cold, but danced so lightly over the snow that
                  the tips of her toes left hardly a print in its surface; while Violet could but
                  just keep pace with her, and Peony's short legs compelled him to lag behind.</p>
               <p>Once, in the course of their play, the strange child placed herself between Violet
                  and Peony, and taking a hand of each, skipped merrily forward, and they along with
                  her. Almost immediately, however, Peony pulled away his little fist, and began to
                  rub it as if the fingers were tingling with cold; while Violet also released
                  herself, though with less abruptness, gravely remarking that it was better not to
                  take hold of hands. The white-robed damsel said not a word, but danced about, just
                  as merrily as before. If Violet and Peony did not choose to play with her, she
                  could make just as good a playmate of the brisk and cold west wind, which kept
                  blowing her all about the garden, and took such liberties with her, that they
                  seemed to have been friends for a long time. All this while, the mother stood on
                  the threshold, wondering how a little girl could look so much like a flying
                  snow-drift, or how a snow-drift could look so very like a little girl.</p>
               <p>She called Violet, and whispered to her.</p>
               <p>"Violet, my darling, what is this child's name?" asked she. "Does she live near
                  us?"</p>
               <p>"Why, dearest mamma," answered Violet, laughing to think that her mother did not
                  comprehend so very plain an affair, "this is our little snow-sister, whom we have
                  just been making!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear mamma," cried Peony, running to his mother, and looking up simply into
                  her face. "This is our snow-image! Is it not a nice 'ittle child?"</p>
               <p>At this instant a flock of snow-birds came flitting through the air. As was very
                  natural, they avoided Violet and Peony. But,—and this looked strange,—they flew at
                  once to the white-robed child, fluttered eagerly about her head, alighted on her
                  shoulders, and seemed to claim her as an old acquaintance. She, on her part, was
                  evidently as glad to see these little birds, old Winter's grandchildren, as they
                  were to see her, and welcomed them by holding out both her hands. Hereupon, they
                  each and all tried to alight on her two palms and ten small fingers and thumbs,
                  crowding one another off, with an immense fluttering of their tiny wings. One dear
                  little bird nestled tenderly in her bosom; another put its bill to her lips. They
                  were as joyous, all the while, and seemed as much in their element, as you may
                  have seen them when sporting with a snow-storm.</p>
               <p>Violet and Peony stood laughing at this pretty sight; for they enjoyed the merry
                  time which their new playmate was having with these small-winged visitants, almost
                  as much as if they themselves took part in it.</p>
               <p>"Violet," said her mother, greatly perplexed, "tell me the truth, without any
                  jest. Who is this little girl?"</p>
               <p>"My darling mamma," answered Violet, looking seriously into her mother's face, and
                  apparently surprised that she should need any further explanation, "I have<pb
                     n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6669-00000012"/> told you truly who she is. It is our
                  little snow-image, which Peony and I have been making. Peony will tell you so, as
                  well as I."</p>
               <p>"Yes, mamma," asseverated Peony, with much gravity in his crimson little phiz;
                  "this is 'ittle snow-child. Is not she a nice one? But, mamma, her hand is, oh, so
                  very cold!"</p>
               <p>While mamma still hesitated what to think and what to do, the street-gate was
                  thrown open, and the father of Violet and Peony appeared, wrapped in a pilot-cloth
                  sack, with a fur cap drawn down over his ears, and the thickest of gloves upon his
                  hands. Mr. Lindsey was a middle-aged man, with a weary and yet a happy look in his
                  wind-flushed and frost-pinched face, as if he had been busy all the day long, and
                  was glad to get back to his quiet home. His eyes brightened at the sight of his
                  wife and children, although he could not help uttering a word or two of surprise,
                  at finding the whole family in the open air, on so bleak a day, and after sunset
                  too. He soon perceived the little white stranger, sporting to and fro in the
                  garden, like a dancing snow-wreath, and the flock of snow-birds fluttering about
                  her head.</p>
               <p>"Pray, what little girl may that be?" inquired this very sensible man. "Surely her
                  mother must be crazy, to let her go out in such bitter weather as it has been
                  to-day, with only that flimsy white gown, and those thin slippers!"</p>
               <p>"My dear husband," said his wife, "I know no more about the little thing than you
                  do. Some neighbor's child, I suppose. Our Violet and Peony," she added, laughing
                  at herself for repeating so absurd a story, "insist that she is nothing but a
                  snow-image, which they have been busy about in the garden, almost all the
                  afternoon."</p>
               <p>As she said this, the mother glanced her eyes toward the spot where the children's
                  snow-image had been made. What was her surprise, on perceiving that there was not
                  the slightest trace of so much labor!—no image at all!—no piled-up heap of
                  snow!—nothing whatever, save the prints of little footsteps around a vacant
                  space!</p>
               <p>"This is very strange!" said she.</p>
               <p>"What is strange, dear mother?" asked Violet. "Dear father, do not you see how it
                  is? This is our snow-image, which Peony and I have made, because we wanted another
                  playmate. Did not we, Peony?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, papa," said crimson Peony. "This be our 'ittle snow-sister. Is she not
                  beau-ti-ful? But she gave me such a cold kiss!"</p>
               <p>"Poh, nonsense, children!" cried their good, honest father, who, as we have
                  already intimated, had an exceedingly common-sensible way of looking at matters.
                  "Do not tell me of making live figures out of snow. Come, wife; this little
                  stranger must not stay out in the bleak air a moment longer. We will bring her
                  into the parlor; and you shall give her a supper of warm bread and milk, and make
                  her as comfortable as you can. Meanwhile, I will inquire among the neighbors; or,
                  if necessary, send the city-crier about the streets, to give notice of a lost
                  child."</p>
               <p>So saying, this honest and very kind-hearted man was going toward the little white
                  damsel, with the best intentions in the world. But Violet and Peony, each seizing
                  their father by the hand, earnestly besought him not to make her come in.</p>
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6669-00000013"/>
               <p>"Dear father," cried Violet, putting herself before him, "it is true what I have
                  been telling you! This is our little snow-girl, and she cannot live any longer
                  than while she breathes the cold west wind. Do not make her come into the hot
                  room!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, father," shouted Peony, stamping his little foot, so mightily was he in
                  earnest, "this be nothing but our 'ittle snow-child! She will not love the hot
                  fire!"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, children, nonsense, nonsense!" cried the father, half vexed, half
                  laughing at what he considered their foolish obstinacy. "Run into the house, this
                  moment! It is too late to play any longer, now. I must take care of this little
                  girl immediately, or she will catch her death-a-cold!"</p>
               <p>"Husband! dear husband!" said his wife, in a low voice,—for she had been looking
                  narrowly at the snow-child, and was more perplexed than ever,—"there is something
                  very singular in all this. You will think me foolish,—but—but—may it not be that
                  some invisible angel has been attracted by the simplicity and good faith with
                  which our children set about their undertaking? May he not have spent an hour of
                  his immortality in playing with those dear little souls? and so the result is what
                  we call a miracle. No, no! Do not laugh at me; I see what a foolish thought it
                  is!"</p>
               <p>"My dear wife," replied the husband, laughing heartily, "you are as much a child
                  as Violet and Peony."</p>
               <p>And in one sense so she was, for all through life she had kept her heart full of
                  childlike simplicity and faith, which was as pure and clear as crystal; and,
                  looking at all matters through this transparent medium, she sometimes saw truths
                  so profound, that other people laughed at them as nonsense and absurdity.</p>
               <p>But now kind Mr. Lindsey had entered the garden, breaking away from his two
                  children, who still sent their shrill voices after him, beseeching him to let the
                  snow-child stay and enjoy herself in the cold west wind. As he approached, the
                  snow-birds took to flight. The little white damsel, also, fled backward, shaking
                  her head, as if to say, "Pray, do not touch me!" and roguishly, as it appeared,
                  leading him through the deepest of the snow. Once, the good man stumbled, and
                  floundered down upon his face, so that, gathering himself up again, with the snow
                  sticking to his rough pilot-cloth sack, he looked as white and wintry as a
                  snow-image of the largest size. Some of the neighbors, meanwhile, seeing him from
                  their windows, wondered what could possess poor Mr. Lindsey to be running about
                  his garden in pursuit of a snow-drift, which the west wind was driving hither and
                  thither! At length, after a vast deal of trouble, he chased the little stranger
                  into a corner, where she could not possibly escape him. His wife had been looking
                  on, and, it being nearly twilight, was wonder-struck to observe how the snow-child
                  gleamed and sparkled, and how she seemed to shed a glow all round about her; and
                  when driven into the corner, she positively glistened like a star! It was a frosty
                  kind of brightness, too, like that of an icicle in the moonlight. The wife thought
                  it strange that good Mr. Lindsey should see nothing remarkable in the snow-child's
                  appearance.</p>
               <p>"Come, you odd little thing!" cried the honest man, seizing her by the hand, "I
                  have caught you at last, and<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6669-00000014"/> will make
                  you comfortable in spite of yourself. We will put a nice warm pair of worsted
                  stockings on your frozen little feet, and you shall have a good thick shawl to
                  wrap yourself in. Your poor white nose, I am afraid, is actually frost-bitten. But
                  we will make it all right. Come along in."</p>
               <p>And so, with a most benevolent smile on his sagacious visage, all purple as it was
                  with the cold, this very well-meaning gentleman took the snow-child by the hand
                  and led her towards the house. She followed him, droopingly and reluctant; for all
                  the glow and sparkle was gone out of her figure; and whereas just before she had
                  resembled a bright, frosty, star-gemmed evening, with a crimson gleam on the cold
                  horizon, she now looked as dull and languid as a thaw. As kind Mr. Lindsey led her
                  up the steps of the door, Violet and Peony looked into his face,—their eyes full
                  of tears, which froze before they could run down their cheeks,—and again entreated
                  him not to bring their snow-image into the house.</p>
               <p>"Not bring her in!" exclaimed the kind-hearted man. "Why, you are crazy, my little
                  Violet!—quite crazy, my small Peony! She is so cold, already, that her hand has
                  almost frozen mine, in spite of my thick gloves. Would you have her freeze to
                  death?"</p>
               <p>His wife, as he came up the steps, had been taking another long, earnest, almost
                  awe-stricken gaze at the little white stranger. She hardly knew whether it was a
                  dream or no; but she could not help fancying that she saw the delicate print of
                  Violet's fingers on the child's neck. It looked just as if, while Violet was
                  shaping out the image, she had given it a gentle pat with her hand, and had
                  neglected to smooth the impression quite away.</p>
               <p>"After all, husband," said the mother, recurring to her idea that the angels would
                  be as much delighted to play with Violet and Peony as she herself was, "after all,
                  she does look strangely like a snow-image! I do believe she is made of snow!"</p>
               <p>A puff of the west wind blew against the snow-child, and again she sparkled like a
                  star.</p>
               <p>"Snow!" repeated good Mr. Lindsey, drawing the reluctant guest over his hospitable
                  threshold. "No wonder she looks like snow. She is half frozen, poor little thing!
                  But a good fire will put everything to rights."</p>
               <p>Without further talk, and always with the same best intentions, this highly
                  benevolent and common-sensible individual led the little white damsel—drooping,
                  drooping, drooping, more and more—out of the frosty air, and into his comfortable
                  parlor. A Heidenberg stove, filled to the brim with intensely burning anthracite,
                  was sending a bright gleam through the isinglass of its iron door, and causing the
                  vase of water on its top to fume and bubble with excitement. A warm, sultry smell
                  was diffused throughout the room. A thermometer on the wall furthest from the
                  stove stood at eighty degrees. The parlor was hung with red curtains, and covered
                  with a red carpet, and looked just as warm as it felt. The difference betwixt the
                  atmosphere here and the cold, wintry twilight out of doors, was like stepping at
                  once from Nova Zembla to the hottest part of India, or from the North Pole into an
                  oven. O, this was a fine place for the little white stranger!</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6669-00000015"/>
               <p>The common-sensible man placed the snow-child on the hearth-rug, right in front of
                  the hissing and fuming stove.</p>
               <p>"Now she will be comfortable!" cried Mr. Lindsey, rubbing his hands and looking
                  about him, with the pleasantest smile you ever saw. "Make yourself at home, my
                  child."</p>
               <p>Sad, sad and drooping, looked the little white maiden, as she stood on the
                  hearth-rug, with the hot blast of the stove striking through her like a
                  pestilence. Once, she threw a glance wistfully toward the windows, and caught a
                  glimpse, through its red curtains, of the snow-covered roofs, and the stars
                  glimmering frostily, and all the delicious intensity of the cold night. The bleak
                  wind rattled the window-panes, as if it were summoning her to come forth. But
                  there stood the snow-child, drooping, before the hot stove!</p>
               <p>But the common-sensible man saw nothing amiss.</p>
               <p>"Come, wife," said he, "let her have a pair of thick stockings and a woolen shawl
                  or blanket directly; and tell Dora to give her some warm supper as soon as the
                  milk boils. You, Violet and Peony, amuse your little friend. She is out of
                  spirits, you see, at finding herself in a strange place. For my part, I will go
                  around among the neighbors, and find out where she belongs."</p>
               <p>The mother, meanwhile, had gone in search of the shawl and stockings; for her own
                  view of the matter, however subtle and delicate, had given way, as it always did,
                  to the stubborn materialism of her husband. Without heeding the remonstrances of
                  his two children, who still kept murmuring that their little snow-sister did not
                  love the warmth, good Mr. Lindsey took his departure, shutting the parlor door
                  carefully behind him. Turning up the collar of his sack over his ears, he emerged
                  from the house, and had barely reached the street-gate, when he was recalled by
                  the screams of Violet and Peony, and the rapping of a thimbled finger against the
                  parlor window.</p>
               <p>"Husband! husband!" cried his wife, showing her horror-stricken face through the
                  window-panes. "There is no need of going for the child's parents!"</p>
               <p>"We told you so, father!" screamed Violet and Peony, as he reëntered the parlor.
                  "You would bring her in; and now our poor—dear—beau-ti-ful little snow-sister is
                  thawed!"</p>
               <p>And their own sweet little faces were already dissolved in tears; so that their
                  father, seeing what strange things occasionally happen in this every-day world,
                  felt not a little anxious lest his children might be going to thaw too! In the
                  utmost perplexity, he demanded an explanation of his wife. She could only reply,
                  that, being summoned to the parlor by the cries of Violet and Peony, she found no
                  trace of the little white maiden, unless it were the remains of a heap of snow,
                  which, while she was gazing at it, melted quite away upon the hearth-rug.</p>
               <p>"And there you see all that is left of it!" added she, pointing to a pool of
                  water, in front of the stove.</p>
               <p>"Yes, father," said Violet, looking reproachfully at him, through her tears,
                  "there is all that is left of our dear little snow-sister!"</p>
               <p>"Naughty father!" cried Peony, stamping his foot, and—I shudder to say—shaking his
                  little fist at the<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6669-00000016"/> common-sensible man.
                  "We told you how it would be What for did you bring her in?"</p>
               <p>And the Heidenberg stove, through the isinglass of its door, seemed to glare at
                  good Mr. Lindsey, like a red-eyed demon, triumphing in the mischief which it had
                  done!</p>
               <p>This, you will observe, was one of those rare cases, which yet will occasionally
                  happen, where common-sense finds itself at fault. The remarkable story of the
                  snow-image, though to that sagacious class of people to whom good Mr. Lindsey
                  belongs it may seem but a childish affair, is, nevertheless, capable of being
                  moralized in various methods, greatly for their edification. One of its lessons,
                  for instance, might be, that it behooves men, and especially men of benevolence,
                  to consider well what they are about, and, before acting on their philanthropic
                  purposes, to be quite sure that they comprehend the nature and all the relations
                  of the business in hand. What has been established as an element of good to one
                  being may prove absolute mischief to another; even as the warmth of the parlor was
                  proper enough for children of flesh and blood, like Violet and Peony,—though by no
                  means very wholesome, even for them,—but involved nothing short of annihilation to
                  the unfortunate snow-image.</p>
               <p>But, after all, there is no teaching anything to wise men of good Mr. Lindsey's
                  stamp. They know everything—oh, to be sure!—everything that has been, and
                  everything that is, and everything that, by any future possibility, can be. And,
                  should some phenomenon of nature or providence transcend their system, they will
                  not recognize it, even if it come to pass under their very noses.</p>
               <p>"Wife," said Mr. Lindsey, after a fit of silence, "see what a quantity of snow the
                  children have brought in on their feet! It has made quite a puddle here before the
                  stove. Pray tell Dora to bring some towels and sop it up!"</p>

               <head>THE GREAT STONE FACE.</head>
               <p>ONE afternoon, when the sun was going down, a mother and her little boy sat at the
                  door of their cottage, talking about the Great Stone Face. They had but to lift
                  their eyes, and there it was plainly to be seen, though miles away, with the
                  sunshine brightening all its features.</p>
               <p>And what was the Great Stone Face?</p>
               <p>Embosomed amongst a family of lofty mountains, there was a valley so spacious that
                  it contained many thousand inhabitants. Some of these good people dwelt in log
                  huts, with the black forest all around them, on the steep and difficult
                  hill-sides. Others had their homes in comfortable farm-houses, and cultivated the
                  rich soil on the gentle slopes or level surfaces of the valley. Others, again,
                  were congregated into populous villages, where some wild, highland rivulet,
                  tumbling down from its birthplace in the upper mountain region, had been caught
                  and tamed by human cunning, and compelled to turn the machinery of cotton
                  factories. The inhabitants of this valley, in short, were numerous, and of many
                  modes of life. But all of them, grown people and children, had a kind of
                  familiarity with the Great Stone Face, although some possessed the gift of
                  distinguishing this grand natural phenomenon more perfectly than many of their
                  neighbors.</p>
               <p>The Great Stone Face, then, was a work of Nature in her mood of majestic
                  playfulness, formed on the perpendicular side of a mountain by some immense rocks,
                  which had been thrown together in such a position as, when viewed at a proper
                  distance, precisely to resemble the features of the human countenance. It seemed
                  as if an enormous giant, or a Titan, had sculptured his own likeness on the
                  precipice. There was the broad arch of the forehead, a hundred feet in height; the
                  nose, with its long bridge; and the vast lips, which, if they could have spoken,
                  would have rolled their thunder accents from one end of the valley to the other.
                  True it is, that if the spectator approached too near, he lost the outline of the
                  gigantic visage, and could discern only a heap of ponderous and gigantic rocks,
                  piled in chaotic ruin one upon another. Retracing his steps, however, the wondrous
                  features would again be seen; and the further he withdrew from them, the more like
                  a human face, with all its original divinity intact, did they appear; until, as it
                  grew dim in the distance, with the clouds and glorified vapor of the mountains
                  clustering about it, the Great Stone Face seemed positively to be alive.</p>
               <p>It was a happy lot for children to grow up to manhood or womanhood with the Great
                  Stone Face before their eyes, for all the features were noble, and the expression
                  was at once grand and sweet, as if it were the glow of a vast, warm heart, that
                  embraced all mankind in its affections, and had room for more. It was an education
                  only to look at it. According to the belief of many people, the valley owed much
                  of its fertility to this benign aspect that was continually beaming over it,
                     illuminating<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6669-00000018"/> minating the clouds, and
                  infusing its tenderness into the sunshine.</p>
               <p>As we began with saying, a mother and her little boy sat at their cottage door,
                  gazing at the Great Stone Face, and talking about it. The child's name was
                  Ernest.</p>
               <p>"Mother," said he, while the Titanic visage smiled on him, "I wish that it could
                  speak, for it looks so very kindly that its voice must needs be pleasant. If I
                  were to see a man with such a face, I should love him dearly."</p>
               <p>"If an old prophecy should come to pass," answered his mother, "we may see a man,
                  some time or other, with exactly such a face as that."</p>
               <p>"What prophecy do you mean, dear mother?" eagerly inquired Ernest. "Pray tell me
                  all about it!"</p>
               <p>So his mother told him a story that her own mother had told to her, when she
                  herself was younger than little Ernest; a story, not of things that were past, but
                  of what was yet to come; a story, nevertheless, so very old, that even the
                  Indians, who formerly inhabited this valley, had heard it from their forefathers,
                  to whom, as they affirmed, it had been murmured by the mountain streams, and
                  whispered by the wind among the tree-tops. The purport was, that, at some future
                  day, a child should be born hereabouts, who was destined to become the greatest
                  and noblest personage of his time, and whose countenance, in manhood, should bear
                  an exact resemblance to the Great Stone Face. Not a few old-fashioned people, and
                  young ones likewise, in the ardor of their hopes, still cherished an enduring
                  faith in this old prophecy. But others, who had seen more of the world, had
                  watched and waited till they were weary, and had beheld no man with such a face,
                  nor any man that proved to be much greater or nobler than his neighbors, concluded
                  it to be nothing but an idle tale. At all events, the great man of the prophecy
                  had not yet appeared.</p>
               <p>"O, mother, dear mother!" cried Ernest, clapping his hands above his head, "I do
                  hope that I shall live to see him!"</p>
               <p>His mother was an affectionate and thoughtful woman, and felt that it was wisest
                  not to discourage the generous hopes of her little boy. So she only said to him,
                  "Perhaps you may."</p>
               <p>And Ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him. It was always in his
                  mind, whenever he looked upon the Great Stone Face. He spent his childhood in the
                  log-cottage where he was born, and was dutiful to his mother, and helpful to her
                  in many things, assisting her much with his little hands, and more with his loving
                  heart. In this manner, from a happy yet often pensive child, he grew up to be a
                  mild, quiet, unobtrusive boy, and sun-browned with labor in the fields, but with
                  more intelligence brightening his aspect than is seen in many lads who have been
                  taught at famous schools. Yet Ernest had had no teacher, save only that the Great
                  Stone Face became one to him. When the toil of the day was over, he would gaze at
                  it for hours, until he began to imagine that those vast features recognized him,
                  and gave him a smile of kindness and encouragement, responsive to his own look of
                  veneration. We must not take upon us to affirm that this was a mistake, although
                  the Face may have looked no more kindly at Ernest than at all the world besides.
                  But the secret<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6669-00000019"/> was, that the boy's tender
                  and confiding simplicity discerned what other people could not see; and thus the
                  love, which was meant for all, became his peculiar portion.</p>
               <p>About this time, there went a rumor throughout the valley, that the great man,
                  foretold from ages long ago, who was to bear a resemblance to the Great Stone
                  Face, had appeared at last. It seems that, many years before, a young man had
                  migrated from the valley and settled at a distant seaport, where, after getting
                  together a little money, he had set up as a shopkeeper. His name—but I could never
                  learn whether it was his real one, or a nickname that had grown out of his habits
                  and success in life—was Gathergold. Being shrewd and active, and endowed by
                  Providence with that inscrutable faculty which develops itself in what the world
                  calls luck, he became an exceedingly rich merchant, and owner of a whole fleet of
                  bulky-bottomed ships. All the countries of the globe appeared to join hands for
                  the mere purpose of adding heap after heap to the mountainous accumulation of this
                  one man's wealth. The cold regions of the north, almost within the gloom and
                  shadow of the Arctic Circle, sent him their tribute in the shape of furs; hot
                  Africa sifted for him the golden sands of her rivers, and gathered up the ivory
                  tusks of her great elephants out of the forests; the East came bringing him the
                  rich shawls, and spices, and teas, and the effulgence of diamonds, and the
                  gleaming purity of large pearls. The ocean, not to be behindhand with the earth,
                  yielded up her mighty whales, that Mr. Gathergold might sell their oil, and make a
                  profit on it. Be the original commodity what it might, it was gold within his
                  grasp. It might be said of him, as of Midas in the fable, that whatever he touched
                  with his finger immediately glistened, and grew yellow, and was changed at once
                  into sterling metal, or, which suited him still better, into piles of coin. And,
                  when Mr. Gathergold had become so very rich that it would have taken him a hundred
                  years only to count his wealth, he bethought himself of his native valley, and
                  resolved to go back thither, and end his days where he was born. With this purpose
                  in view, he sent a skilful architect to build him such a palace as should be fit
                  for a man of his vast wealth to live in.</p>
               <p>As I have said above, it had already been rumored in the valley that Mr.
                  Gathergold had turned out to be the prophetic personage so long and vainly looked
                  for, and that his visage was the perfect and undeniable similitude of the Great
                  Stone Face. People were the more ready to believe that this must needs be the
                  fact, when they beheld the splendid edifice that rose, as if by enchantment, on
                  the site of his father's old weather-beaten farm-house. The exterior was of
                  marble, so dazzlingly white that it seemed as though the whole structure might
                  melt away in the sunshine, like those humbler ones which Mr. Gathergold, in his
                  young play-days, before his fingers were gifted with the touch of transmutation,
                  had been accustomed to build of snow. It had a richly ornamented portico,
                  supported by tall pillars, beneath which was a lofty door, studded with silver
                  knobs, and made of a kind of variegated wood that had been brought from beyond the
                  sea. The windows, from the floor to the ceiling of each stately apartment, were
                  composed, respectively, of but one enormous pane of glass, so transparently pure
                  that it was said to be a finer medium<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6669-00000020"/>
                  dium than even the vacant atmosphere. Hardly anybody had been permitted to see the
                  interior of this palace; but it was reported, and with good semblance of truth, to
                  be far more gorgeous than the outside, insomuch that whatever was iron or brass in
                  other houses, was silver or gold in this; and Mr. Gathergold's bed-chamber,
                  especially, made such a glittering appearance that no ordinary man would have been
                  able to close his eyes there. But, on the other hand, Mr. Gathergold was now so
                  inured to wealth, that perhaps he could not have closed his eyes unless where the
                  gleam of it was certain to find its way beneath his eyelids.</p>
               <p>In due time, the mansion was finished; next came the upholsterers, with
                  magnificent furniture; then, a whole troop of black and white servants, the
                  harbingers of Mr. Gathergold, who, in his own majestic person, was expected to
                  arrive at sunset. Our friend Ernest, meanwhile, had been deeply stirred by the
                  idea that the great man, the noble man, the man of prophecy, after so many ages of
                  delay, was at length to be made manifest to his native valley. He knew, boy as he
                  was, that there were a thousand ways in which Mr. Gathergold, with his vast
                  wealth, might transform himself into an angel of beneficence, and assume a control
                  over human affairs as wide and benignant as the smile of the Great Stone Face.
                  Full of faith and hope, Ernest doubted not that what the people said was true, and
                  that now he was to behold the living likeness of those wondrous features on the
                  mountain side. While the boy was still gazing up the valley, and fancying, as he
                  always did, that the Great Stone Face returned his gaze and looked kindly at him,
                  the rumbling of wheels was heard, approaching swiftly along the winding road.</p>
               <p>"Here he comes!" cried a group of people who were assembled to witness the
                  arrival. "Here comes the great Mr. Gathergold!"</p>
               <p>A carriage, drawn by four horses, dashed round the turn of the road. Within it,
                  thrust partly out of the window, appeared the physiognomy of a little old man,
                  with a skin as yellow as if his own Midas-hand had transmuted it. He had a low
                  forehead, small, sharp eyes, puckered about with innumerable wrinkles, and very
                  thin lips, which he made still thinner by pressing them forcibly together.</p>
               <p>"The very image of the Great Stone Face!" shouted the people. "Sure enough, the
                  old prophecy is true; and here we have the great man come, at last!"</p>
               <p>And, what greatly perplexed Ernest, they seemed actually to believe that here was
                  the likeness which they spoke of. By the road-side there chanced to be an old
                  beggar-woman and two little beggar-children, stragglers from some far-off region,
                  who, as the carriage rolled onward, held out their hands and lifted up their
                  doleful voices, most piteously beseeching charity. A yellow claw—the very same
                  that had clawed together so much wealth—poked itself out of the coach-window, and
                  dropt some copper coins upon the ground; so that, though the great man's name
                  seems to have been Gathergold, he might just as suitably have been nicknamed
                  Scattercopper. Still, nevertheless, with an earnest shout, and evidently with as
                  much good faith as ever, the people bellowed,</p>
               <p>"He is the very image of the Great Stone Face!"</p>
               <p>But Ernest turned sadly from the wrinkled shrewdness<pb n="44-45"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000021"/> ness of that sordid visage, and gazed up the
                  valley, where, amid a gathering mist, gilded by the last sunbeams, he could still
                  distinguish those glorious features which had impressed themselves into his soul.
                  Their aspect cheered him. What did the benign lips seem to say?</p>
               <p>"He will come! Fear not, Ernest; the man will come!"</p>
               <p>The years went on, and Ernest ceased to be a boy. He had grown to be a young man
                  now. He attracted little notice from the other inhabitants of the valley; for they
                  saw nothing remarkable in his way of life, save that, when the labor of the day
                  was over, he still loved to go apart and gaze and meditate upon the Great Stone
                  Face. According to their idea of the matter, it was a folly, indeed, but
                  pardonable, inasmuch as Ernest was industrious, kind, and neighborly, and
                  neglected no duty for the sake of indulging this idle habit. They knew not that
                  the Great Stone Face had become a teacher to him, and that the sentiment which was
                  expressed in it would enlarge the young man's heart, and fill it with wider and
                  deeper sympathies than other hearts. They knew not that thence would come a better
                  wisdom than could be learned from books, and a better life than could be moulded
                  on the defaced example of other human lives. Neither did Ernest know that the
                  thoughts and affections which came to him so naturally, in the fields and at the
                  fireside, and wherever he communed with himself, were of a higher tone than those
                  which all men shared with him. A simple soul,—simple as when his mother first
                  taught him the old prophecy,—he beheld the marvellous features beaming adown the
                  valley, and still wondered that their human counterpart was so long in making his
                  appearance.</p>
               <p>By this time poor Mr. Gathergold was dead and buried; and the oddest part of the
                  matter was, that his wealth, which was the body and spirit of his existence, had
                  disappeared before his death, leaving nothing of him but a living skeleton,
                  covered over with a wrinkled, yellow skin. Since the melting away of his gold, it
                  had been very generally conceded that there was no such striking resemblance,
                  after all, betwixt the ignoble features of the ruined merchant and that majestic
                  face upon the mountain side. So the people ceased to honor him during his
                  lifetime, and quietly consigned him to forgetfulness after his decease. Once in a
                  while, it is true, his memory was brought up in connection with the magnificent
                  palace which he had built, and which had long ago been turned into a hotel for the
                  accommodation of strangers, multitudes of whom came, every summer, to visit that
                  famous natural curiosity, the Great Stone Face. Thus, Mr. Gathergold being
                  discredited and thrown into the shade, the man of prophecy was yet to come.</p>
               <p>It so happened that a native-born son of the valley, many years before, had
                  enlisted as a soldier, and, after a great deal of hard fighting, had now become an
                  illustrious commander. Whatever he may be called in history, he was known in camps
                  and on the battle-field under the nickname of Old Blood-and-Thunder. This war-worn
                  veteran, being now infirm with age and wounds, and weary of the turmoil of a
                  military life, and of the roll of the drum and the clangor of the trumpet, that
                  had so long been ringing in his ears, had lately signified a purpose<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000022"/> pose of returning to his native valley, hoping to
                  find repose where he remembered to have left it. The inhabitants, his old
                  neighbors and their grown-up children, were resolved to welcome the renowned
                  warrior with a salute of cannon and a public dinner; and all the more
                  enthusiastically, it being affirmed that now, at last, the likeness of the Great
                  Stone Face had actually appeared. An aid-de-camp of old Blood-and-Thunder,
                  travelling through the valley, was said to have been struck with the resemblance.
                  Moreover, the schoolmates and early acquaintances of the general were ready to
                  testify, on oath, that, to the best of their recollection, the aforesaid general
                  had been exceedingly like the majestic image, even when a boy, only that the idea
                  had never occurred to them at that period. Great, therefore, was the excitement
                  throughout the valley; and many people, who had never once thought of glancing at
                  the Great Stone Face for years before, now spent their time in gazing at it, for
                  the sake of knowing exactly how General Blood-and-Thunder looked.</p>
               <p>On the day of the great festival, Ernest, with all the other people of the valley,
                  left their work, and proceeded to the spot where the sylvan banquet was prepared.
                  As he approached, the loud voice of the Reverend Doctor Battleblast was heard,
                  beseeching a blessing on the good things set before them, and on the distinguished
                  friend of peace in whose honor they were assembled. The tables were arranged in a
                  cleared space of the woods, shut in by the surrounding trees, except where a vista
                  opened eastward, and afforded a distant view of the Great Stone Face. Over the
                  general's chair, which was a relic from the home of Washington, there was an arch
                  of verdant boughs, with the laurel profusely intermixed, and surmounted by his
                  country's banner, beneath which he had won his victories. Our friend Ernest raised
                  himself on his tip-toes, in hopes to get a glimpse of the celebrated guest; but
                  there was a mighty crowd about the tables anxious to hear the toasts and speeches,
                  and to catch any word that might fall from the general in reply; and a volunteer
                  company, doing duty as a guard, pricked ruthlessly with their bayonets at any
                  particularly quiet person among the throng. So Ernest, being of an unobtrusive
                  character, was thrust quiet into the background, where he could see no more of Old
                  Blood-and-Thunder's physiognomy than if it had been still blazing on the
                  battle-field. To console himself, he turned towards the Great Stone Face, which,
                  like a faithful and long-remembered friend, looked back and smiled upon him
                  through the vista of the forest. Meantime, however, he could overhear the remarks
                  of various individuals, who were comparing the features of the hero with the face
                  on the distant mountain side.</p>
               <p>"'T is the same face, to a hair!" cried one man, cutting a caper for joy.</p>
               <p>"Wonderfully like, that's a fact!" responded another.</p>
               <p>"Like! why, I call it Old Blood-and-Thunder himself, in a monstrous
                  looking-glass!" cried a third. "And why not? He's the greatest man of this or any
                  other age, beyond a doubt."</p>
               <p>And then all three of the speakers gave a great shout, which communicated
                  electricity to the crowd, and called forth a roar from a thousand voices, that
                  went reverberating for miles among the mountains, until you might have supposed
                  that the Great Stone Face had poured its<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6669-00000023"/>
                  thunder-breath into the cry. All these comments, and this vast enthusiasm, served
                  the more to interest our friend; nor did he think of questioning that now, at
                  length, the mountain-visage had found its human counterpart. It is true, Ernest
                  had imagined that this long-looked-for personage would appear in the character of
                  a man of peace, uttering wisdom, and doing good, and making people happy. But,
                  taking an habitual breadth of view, with all his simplicity, he contended that
                  Providence should choose its own method of blessing mankind, and could conceive
                  that this great end might be effected even by a warrior and a bloody sword, should
                  inscrutable wisdom see fit to order matters so.</p>
               <p>"The general! the general!" was now the cry. "Hush! silence! Old
                  Blood-and-Thunder's going to make a speech."</p>
               <p>Even so; for, the cloth being removed, the general's health had been drunk amid
                  shouts of applause, and he now stood upon his feet to thank the company. Ernest
                  saw him. There he was, over the shoulders of the crowd, from the two glittering
                  epaulets and embroidered collar upward, beneath the arch of green boughs with
                  intertwined laurel, and the banner drooping as if to shade his brow! And there,
                  too, visible in the same glance, through the vista of the forest, appeared the
                  Great Stone Face! And was there, indeed, such a resemblance as the crowd had
                  testified? Alas, Ernest could not recognize it! He beheld a war-worn and
                  weather-beaten countenance, full of energy, and expressive of an iron will; but
                  the gentle wisdom, the deep, broad, tender sympathies, were altogether wanting in
                  Old Blood-and-Thunder's visage; and even if the Great Stone Face had assumed his
                  look of stern command, the milder traits would still have tempered it.</p>
               <p>"This is not the man of prophecy," sighed Ernest to himself, as he made his way
                  out of the throng. "And must the world wait longer yet?"</p>
               <p>The mists had congregated about the distant mountain side, and there were seen the
                  grand and awful features of the Great Stone Face, awful but benignant, as if a
                  mighty angel were sitting among the hills, and enrobing himself in a cloud-vesture
                  of gold and purple. As he looked, Ernest could hardly believe but that a smile
                  beamed over the whole visage, with a radiance still brightening, although without
                  motion of the lips. It was probably the effect of the western sunshine, melting
                  through the thinly diffused vapors that had swept between him and the object that
                  he gazed at. But—as it always did—the aspect of his marvellous friend made Ernest
                  as hopeful as if he had never hoped in vain.</p>
               <p>"Fear not, Ernest," said his heart, even as if the Great Face were whispering him,
                  "fear not, Ernest; he will come."</p>
               <p>More years sped swiftly and tranquilly away. Ernest still dwelt in his native
                  valley, and was now a man of middle age. By imperceptible degrees, he had become
                  known among the people. Now, as heretofore, he labored for his bread, and was the
                  same simple-hearted man that he had always been. But he had thought and felt so
                  much, he had given so many of the best hours of his life to unworldly hopes for
                  some great good to mankind, that it seemed as though he had been talking with the
                  angels, and had imbibed a portion of their<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6669-00000024"
                  /> wisdom unawares. It was visible in the calm and well-considered beneficence of
                  his daily life, the quiet stream of which had made a wide green margin all along
                  its course. Not a day passed by, that the world was not the better because this
                  man, humble as he was, had lived. He never stepped aside from his own path, yet
                  would always reach a blessing to his neighbor. Almost involuntarily, too, he had
                  become a preacher. The pure and high simplicity of his thought, which, as one of
                  its manifestations, took shape in the good deeds that dropped silently from his
                  hand, flowed also forth in speech. He uttered truths that wrought upon and moulded
                  the lives of those who heard him. His auditors, it may be, never suspected that
                  Ernest, their own neighbor and familiar friend, was more than an ordinary man;
                  least of all did Ernest himself suspect it; but, inevitably as the murmur of a
                  rivulet, came thoughts out of his mouth that no other human lips had spoken.</p>
               <p>When the people's minds had had a little time to cool, they were ready enough to
                  acknowledge their mistake in imagining a similarity between General
                  Blood-and-Thunder's truculent physiognomy and the benign visage on the mountain
                  side. But now, again, there were reports and many paragraphs in the newspapers,
                  affirming that the likeness of the Great Stone Face had appeared upon the broad
                  shoulders of a certain eminent statesman. He, like Mr. Gathergold and Old
                  Blood-and-Thunder, was a native of the valley, but had left it in his early days,
                  and taken up the trades of law and politics. Instead of the rich man's wealth and
                  the warrior's sword, he had but a tongue, and it was mightier than both together.
                  So wonderfully eloquent was he, that whatever he might choose to say, his auditors
                  had no choice but to believe him; wrong looked like right, and right like wrong;
                  for when it pleased him, he could make a kind of illuminated fog with his mere
                  breath, and obscure the natural daylight with it. His tongue, indeed, was a magic
                  instrument: sometimes it rumbled like the thunder; sometimes it warbled like the
                  sweetest music. It was the blast of war—the song of peace; and it seemed to have a
                  heart in it, when there was no such matter. In good truth, he was a wondrous man;
                  and when his tongue had acquired him all other imaginable success,—when it had
                  been heard in halls of state, and in the courts of princes and potentates,—after
                  it had made him known all over the world, even as a voice crying from shore to
                  shore,—it finally persuaded his countrymen to select him for the presidency.
                  Before this time,—indeed, as soon as he began to grow celebrated,—his admirers had
                  found out the resemblance between him and the Great Stone Face; and so much were
                  they struck by it, that throughout the country this distinguished gentleman was
                  known by the name of Old Stony Phiz. The phrase was considered as giving a highly
                  favorable aspect to his political prospects; for, as is likewise the case with the
                  Popedom, nobody ever becomes president without taking a name other than his
                  own.</p>
               <p>While his friends were doing their best to make him president, Old Stony Phiz, as
                  he was called, set out on a visit to the valley where he was born. Of course, he
                  had no other object than to shake hands with his fellow-citizens, and neither
                  thought nor cared about any effect which his progress through the country might
                  have upon<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6669-00000025"/> the election. Magnificent
                  preparations were made to receive the illustrious statesman; a cavalcade of
                  horsemen set forth to meet him at the boundary line of the state, and all the
                  people left their business and gathered along the wayside to see him pass. Among
                  these was Ernest. Though more than once disappointed, as we have seen, he had such
                  a hopeful and confiding nature, that he was always ready to believe in whatever
                  seemed beautiful and good. He kept his heart continually open, and thus was sure
                  to catch the blessing from on high, when it should come. So now again, as
                  buoyantly as ever, he went forth to behold the likeness of the Great Stone
                  Face.</p>
               <p>The cavalcade came prancing along the road, with a great clattering of hoofs and a
                  mighty cloud of dust, which rose up so dense and high that the visage of the
                  mountain side was completely hidden from Ernest's eyes. All the great men of the
                  neighborhood were there on horseback: militia officers, in uniform; the member of
                  Congress; the sheriff of the county; the editors of newspapers; and many a farmer,
                  too, had mounted his patient steed, with his Sunday coat upon his back. It really
                  was a very brilliant spectacle, especially as there were numerous banners
                  flaunting over the cavalcade, on some of which were gorgeous portraits of the
                  illustrious statesman and the Great Stone Face, smiling familiarly at one another,
                  like two brothers. If the pictures were to be trusted, the mutual resemblance, it
                  must be confessed, was marvellous. We must not forget to mention that there was a
                  band of music, which made the echoes of the mountains ring and reverberate with
                  the loud triumph of its strains; so that airy and soul-thrilling melodies broke
                  out among all the heights and hollows, as if every nook of his native valley had
                  found a voice, to welcome the distinguished guest. But the grandest effect was
                  when the far-off mountain precipice flung back the music; for then the Great Stone
                  Face itself seemed to be swelling the triumphant chorus, in acknowledgment that,
                  at length, the man of prophecy was come.</p>
               <p>All this while the people were throwing up their hats and shouting, with
                  enthusiasm so contagious that the heart of Ernest kindled up, and he likewise
                  threw up his hat, and shouted, as loudly as the loudest, "Huzza for the great man!
                  Huzza for Old Stony Phiz!" But as yet he had not seen him.</p>
               <p>"Here he is, now!" cried those who stood near Ernest. "There! There! Look at Old
                  Stony Phiz and then at the Old Man of the Mountain, and see if they are not as
                  like as two twin-brothers!"</p>
               <p>In the midst of all this gallant array, came an open barouche, drawn by four white
                  horses; and in the barouche, with his massive head uncovered, sat the illustrious
                  statesman, Old Stony Phiz himself.</p>
               <p>"Confess it," said one of Ernest's neighbors to him, "the Great Stone Face has met
                  its match at last!"</p>
               <p>Now, it must be owned that, at his first glimpse of the countenance which was
                  bowing and smiling from the barouche, Ernest did fancy that there was a
                  resemblance between it and the old familiar face upon the mountain side. The brow,
                  with its massive depth and loftiness, and all the other features, indeed, were
                  boldly and strongly hewn, as if in emulation of a more than heroic, of a Titanic
                  model. But the sublimity and stateliness, the grand expression of a divine
                  sympathy, that illuminated<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6669-00000026"/> the mountain
                  visage, and etherealized its ponderous granite substance into spirit, might here
                  be sought in vain. Something had been originally left out, or had departed. And
                  therefore the marvellously gifted statesman had always a weary gloom in the deep
                  caverns of his eyes, as of a child that has outgrown its playthings, or a man of
                  mighty faculties and little aims, whose life, with all its high performances, was
                  vague and empty, because no high purpose had endowed it with reality.</p>
               <p>Still, Ernest's neighbor was thrusting his elbow into his side, and pressing him
                  for an answer.</p>
               <p>"Confess! confess! Is not he the very picture of your Old Man of the
                  Mountain?"</p>
               <p>"No!" said Ernest, bluntly, "I see little or no likeness."</p>
               <p>"Then so much the worse for the Great Stone Face!" answered his neighbor; and
                  again he set up a shout for Old Stony Phiz.</p>
               <p>But Ernest turned away, melancholy, and almost despondent; for this was the
                  saddest of his disappointments, to behold a man who might have fulfilled the
                  prophecy, and had not willed to do so. Meantime, the cavalcade, the banners, the
                  music, and the barouches, swept past him, with the vociferous crowd in the rear,
                  leaving the dust to settle down, and the Great Stone Face to be revealed again,
                  with the grandeur that it had worn for untold centuries.</p>
               <p>"Lo, here I am, Ernest!" the benign lips seemed to say. "I have waited longer than
                  thou, and am not yet weary. Fear not; the man will come."</p>
               <p>The years hurried onward, treading in their haste on one another's heels. And now
                  they began to bring white hairs, and scatter them over the head of Ernest; they
                  made reverend wrinkles across his forehead, and furrows in his cheeks. He was an
                  aged man. But not in vain had he grown old: more than the white hairs on his head
                  were the sage thoughts in his mind; his wrinkles and furrows were inscriptions
                  that Time had graved, and in which he had written legends of wisdom that had been
                  tested by the tenor of a life. And Ernest had ceased to be obscure. Unsought for,
                  undesired, had come the fame which so many seek, and made him known in the great
                  world, beyond the limits of the valley in which he had dwelt so quietly. College
                  professors, and even the active men of cities, came from far to see and converse
                  with Ernest; for the report had gone abroad that this simple husbandman had ideas
                  unlike those of other men, not gained from books, but of a higher tone,—a tranquil
                  and familiar majesty, as if he had been talking with the angels as his daily
                  friends. Whether it were sage, statesman, or philanthropist, Ernest received these
                  visiters with the gentle sincerity that had characterized him from boyhood, and
                  spoke freely with them of whatever came uppermost, or lay deepest in his heart or
                  their own. While they talked together, his face would kindle, unawares, and shine
                  upon them, as with a mild evening light. Pensive with the fulness of such
                  discourse, his guests took leave and went their way; and, passing up the valley,
                  paused to look at the Great Stone Face, imagining that they had seen its likeness
                  in a human countenance, but could not remember where.</p>
               <p>While Ernest had been growing up and growing old, a bountiful Providence had
                  granted a new poet to this earth. He, likewise, was a native of the valley, but
                     had<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6669-00000027"/> spent the greater part of his life
                  at a distance from that romantic region, pouring out his sweet music amid the
                  bustle and din of cities. Often, however, did the mountains which had been
                  familiar to him in his childhood lift their snowy peaks into the clear atmosphere
                  of his poetry. Neither was the Great Stone Face forgotten, for the poet had
                  celebrated it in an ode, which was grand enough to have been uttered by its own
                  majestic lips. This man of genius, we may say, had come down from heaven with
                  wonderful endowments. If he sang of a mountain, the eyes of all mankind beheld a
                  mightier grandeur reposing on its breast, or soaring to its summit, than had
                  before been seen there. If his theme were a lovely lake, a celestial smile had now
                  been thrown over it, to gleam forever on its surface. If it were the vast old sea,
                  even the deep immensity of its dread bosom seemed to swell the higher, as if moved
                  by the emotions of the song. Thus the world assumed another and a better aspect
                  from the hour that the poet blessed it with his happy eyes. The Creator had
                  bestowed him, as the last, best touch to his own handiwork. Creation was not
                  finished till the poet came to interpret, and so complete it.</p>
               <p>The effect was no less high and beautiful, when his human brethren were the
                  subject of his verse. The man or woman, sordid with the common dust of life, who
                  crossed his daily path, and the little child who played in it, were glorified if
                  he beheld them in his mood of poetic faith. He showed the golden links of the
                  great chain that intertwined them with an angelic kindred; he brought out the
                  hidden traits of a celestial birth that made them worthy of such kin. Some,
                  indeed, there were, who thought to show the soundness of their judgment by
                  affirming that all the beauty and dignity of the natural world existed only in the
                  poet's fancy. Let such men speak for themselves, who undoubtedly appear to have
                  been spawned forth by Nature with a contemptuous bitterness; she having plastered
                  them up out of her refuse stuff, after all the swine were made. As respects all
                  things else, the poet's ideal was the truest truth.</p>
               <p>The songs of this poet found their way to Ernest. He read them, after his
                  customary toil, seated on the bench before his cottage door, where, for such a
                  length of time, he had filled his repose with thought, by gazing at the Great
                  Stone Face. And now, as he read stanzas that caused the soul to thrill within him,
                  he lifted his eyes to the vast countenance beaming on him so benignantly.</p>
               <p>"O, majestic friend," he murmured, addressing the Great Stone Face, "is not this
                  man worthy to resemble thee?"</p>
               <p>The Face seemed to smile, but answered not a word.</p>
               <p>Now it happened that the poet, though he dwelt so far away, had not only heard of
                  Ernest, but had meditated much upon his character, until he deemed nothing so
                  desirable as to meet this man, whose untaught wisdom walked hand in hand with the
                  noble simplicity of his life. One summer morning, therefore, he took passage by
                  the railroad, and, in the decline of the afternoon, alighted from the cars at no
                  great distance from Ernest's cottage. The great hotel, which had formerly been the
                  palace of Mr. Gathergold, was close at hand, but the poet, with his carpet-bag on
                  his arm, inquired at once<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6669-00000028"/> where Ernest
                  dwelt, and was resolved to be accepted as his guest.</p>
               <p>Approaching the door, he there found the good old man, holding a volume in his
                  hand, which alternately he read, and then, with a finger between the leaves,
                  looked lovingly at the Great Stone Face.</p>
               <p>"Good-evening," said the poet. "Can you give a traveller a night's lodging?"</p>
               <p>"Willingly," answered Ernest; and then he added, smiling, "Methinks I never saw
                  the Great Stone Face look so hospitably at a stranger."</p>
               <p>The poet sat down on the bench beside him, and he and Ernest talked together.
                  Often had the poet held intercourse with the wittiest and the wisest, but never
                  before with a man like Ernest, whose thoughts and feelings gushed up with such a
                  natural freedom, and who made great truths so familiar by his simple utterance of
                  them. Angels, as had been so often said, seemed to have wrought with him at his
                  labor in the fields; angels seemed to have sat with him by the fireside; and,
                  dwelling with angels as friend with friends, he had imbibed the sublimity of their
                  ideas, and imbued it with the sweet and lowly charm of household words. So thought
                  the poet. And Ernest, on the other hand, was moved and agitated by the living
                  images which the poet flung out of his mind, and which peopled all the air about
                  the cottage door with shapes of beauty, both gay and pensive. The sympathies of
                  these two men instructed them with a profounder sense than either could have
                  attained alone. Their minds accorded into one strain, and made delightful music
                  which neither of them could have claimed as all his own, nor distinguished his own
                  share from the other's. They led one another, as it were, into a high pavilion of
                  their thoughts, so remote, and hitherto so dim, that they had never entered it
                  before, and so beautiful that they desired to be there always.</p>
               <p>As Ernest listened to the poet, he imagined that the Great Stone Face was bending
                  forward to listen too. He gazed earnestly into the poet's glowing eyes.</p>
               <p>"Who are you, my strangely gifted guest?" he said.</p>
               <p>The poet laid his finger on the volume that Ernest had been reading.</p>
               <p>"You have read these poems," said he. "You know me, then,—for I wrote them."</p>
               <p>Again, and still more earnestly than before, Ernest examined the poet's features;
                  then turned towards the Great Stone Face; then back, with an uncertain aspect, to
                  his guest. But his countenance fell; he shook his head, and sighed.</p>
               <p>"Wherefore are you sad?" inquired the poet.</p>
               <p>"Because," replied Ernest, "all through life I have awaited the fulfilment of a
                  prophecy; and, when I read these poems, I hoped that it might be fulfilled in
                  you."</p>
               <p>"You hoped," answered the poet, faintly smiling, "to find in me the likeness of
                  the Great Stone Face. And you are disappointed, as formerly with Mr. Gathergold,
                  and Old Blood-and-Thunder, and Old Stony Phiz. Yes, Ernest, it is my doom. You
                  must add my name to the illustrious three, and record another failure of your
                  hopes. For—in shame and sadness do I speak it, Ernest—I am not worthy to be
                  typified by yonder benign and majestic image."</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6669-00000029"/>
               <p>"And why?" asked Ernest. He pointed to the volume;—"Are not those thoughts
                  divine?"</p>
               <p>"They have a strain of the Divinity," replied the poet. "You can hear in them the
                  far-off echo of a heavenly song. But my life, dear Ernest, has not corresponded
                  with my thought. I have had grand dreams, but they have been only dreams, because
                  I have lived—and that, too, by my own choice—among poor and mean realities.
                  Sometimes even—shall I dare to say it?—I lack faith in the grandeur, the beauty,
                  and the goodness, which my own works are said to have made more evident in nature
                  and in human life. Why, then, pure seeker of the good and true, shouldst thou hope
                  to find me, in yonder image of the divine!"</p>
               <p>The poet spoke sadly, and his eyes were dim with tears. So, likewise, were those
                  of Ernest.</p>
               <p>At the hour of sunset, as had long been his frequent custom, Ernest was to
                  discourse to an assemblage of the neighboring inhabitants, in the open air. He and
                  the poet, arm in arm, still talking together as they went along, proceeded to the
                  spot. It was a small nook among the hills, with a gray precipice behind, the stern
                  front of which was relieved by the pleasant foliage of many creeping plants, that
                  made a tapestry for the naked rock, by hanging their festoons from all its rugged
                  angles. At a small elevation above the ground, set in a rich frame-work of
                  verdure, there appeared a niche, spacious enough to admit a human figure, with
                  freedom for such gestures as spontaneously accompany earnest thought and genuine
                  emotion. Into this natural pulpit Ernest ascended, and threw a look of familiar
                  kindness around upon his audience. They stood, or sat, or reclined clined upon the
                  grass, as seemed good to each, with the departing sunshine falling obliquely over
                  them, and mingling its subdued cheerfulness with the solemnity of a grove of
                  ancient trees, beneath and amid the boughs of which the golden rays were
                  constrained to pass. In another direction was seen the Great Stone Face, with the
                  same cheer, combined with the same solemnity, in its benignant aspect.</p>
               <p>Ernest began to speak, giving to the people of what was in his heart and mind. His
                  words had power, because they accorded with his thoughts; and his thoughts had
                  reality and depth, because they harmonized with the life which he had always
                  lived. It was not mere breath that this preacher uttered; they were the words of
                  life, because a life of good deeds and holy love was melted into them. Pearls,
                  pure and rich, had been dissolved into this precious draught. The poet, as he
                  listened, felt that the being and character of Ernest were a nobler strain of
                  poetry than he had ever written. His eyes glistening with tears, he gazed
                  reverentially at the venerable man, and said within himself that never was there
                  an aspect so worthy of a prophet and a sage as that mild, sweet, thoughtful
                  countenance, with the glory of white hair diffused about it. At a distance, but
                  distinctly to be seen, high up in the golden light of the setting sun, appeared
                  the Great Stone Face, with hoary mists around it, like the white hairs around the
                  brow of Ernest. Its look of grand beneficence seemed to embrace the world.</p>
               <p>At that moment, in sympathy with a thought which he was about to utter, the face
                  of Ernest assumed a grandeur of expression, so imbued with benevolence, that<pb
                     n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6669-00000030"/> the poet, by an irresistible impulse,
                  threw his arms aloft, and shouted,</p>
               <p>"Behold! Behold! Ernest is himself the likeness of the Great Stone Face!"</p>
               <p>Then all the people looked, and saw that what the deep-sighted poet said was true.
                  The prophecy was fulfilled. But Ernest, having finished what he had to say, took
                  the poet's arm, and walked slowly homeward, still hoping that some wiser and
                  better man than himself would by and by appear, bearing a resemblance to the GREAT
                  STONE FACE.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>MAIN-STREET.</head>
               <p>A RESPECTABLE-LOOKING individual makes his bow, and addresses the public. In my
                  daily walks along the principal street of my native town, it has often occurred to
                  me, that, if its growth from infancy upward, and the vicissitude of characteristic
                  scenes that have passed along this thoroughfare during the more than two centuries
                  of its existence, could be presented to the eye in a shifting panorama, it would
                  be an exceedingly effective method of illustrating the march of time. Acting on
                  this idea, I have contrived a certain pictorial exhibition, somewhat in the nature
                  of a puppet-show, by means of which I propose to call up the multiform and
                  many-colored Past before the spectator, and show him the ghosts of his
                  forefathers, amid a succession of historic incidents, with no greater trouble than
                  the turning of a crank. Be pleased, therefore, my indulgent patrons, to walk into
                  the show-room, and take your seats before yonder mysterious curtain. The little
                  wheels and springs of my machinery have been well oiled; a multitude of puppets
                  are dressed in character, representing all varieties of fashion, from the Puritan
                  cloak and jerkin to the latest Oak Hall coat; the lamps are trimmed, and shall
                  brighten into noontide sunshine, or fade away in moonlight, or muffle their
                  brilliancy in a November cloud, as the nature of the scene may require; and, in
                  short, the<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6669-00000031"/> exhibition is just ready to
                  commence. Unless something should go wrong,—as, for instance, the misplacing of a
                  picture, whereby the people and events of one century might be thrust into the
                  middle of another; or the breaking of a wire, which would bring the course of time
                  to a sudden period,—barring, I say, the casualties to which such a complicated
                  piece of mechanism is liable,—I flatter myself, ladies and gentlemen, that the
                  performance will elicit your generous approbation.</p>
               <p>Ting-a-ting-ting! goes the bell; the curtain rises; and we behold—not, indeed, the
                  Main-street—but the track of leaf-strewn forest-land over which its dusty pavement
                  is hereafter to extend.</p>
               <p>You perceive, at a glance, that this is the ancient and primitive wood,—the
                  ever-youthful and venerably old,—verdant with new twigs, yet hoary, as it were,
                  with the snowfall of innumerable years, that have accumulated upon its
                  intermingled branches. The white man's axe has never smitten a single tree; his
                  footstep has never crumpled a single one of the withered leaves, which all the
                  autumns since the flood have been harvesting beneath. Yet, see! along through the
                  vista of impending boughs, there is already a faintly-traced path, running nearly
                  east and west, as if a prophecy or foreboding of the future street had stolen into
                  the heart of the solemn old wood. Onward goes this hardly perceptible track, now
                  ascending over a natural swell of land, now subsiding gently into a hollow;
                  traversed here by a little streamlet, which glitters like a snake through the
                  gleam of sunshine, and quickly hides itself among the underbrush, in its quest for
                  the neighboring cove; and impeded there by the massy corpse of a giant of the
                  forest, which had lived out its incalculable term of life, and been overthrown by
                  mere old age, and lies buried in the new vegetation that is born of its decay.
                  What footsteps can have worn this half-seen path? Hark! Do we not hear them now
                  rustling softly over the leaves? We discern an Indian woman,—a majestic and
                  queenly woman, or else her spectral image does not represent her truly,—for this
                  is the great Squaw Sachem, whose rule, with that of her sons, extends from Mystic
                  to Agawam. That red chief, who stalks by her side, is Wappacowet, her second
                  husband, the priest and magician, whose incantations shall hereafter affright the
                  pale-faced settlers with grisly phantoms, dancing and shrieking in the woods, at
                  midnight. But greater would be the affright of the Indian necromancer, if,
                  mirrored in the pool of water at his feet, he could catch a prophetic glimpse of
                  the noon-day marvels which the white man is destined to achieve; if he could see,
                  as in a dream, the stone-front of the stately hall, which will cast its shadow
                  over this very spot; if he could be aware that the future edifice will contain a
                  noble Museum, where, among countless curiosities of earth and sea, a few Indian
                  arrow-heads shall be treasured up as memorials of a vanished race!</p>
               <p>No such forebodings disturb the Squaw Sachem and Wappacowet. They pass on, beneath
                  the tangled shade, holding high talk on matters of state and religion, and
                  imagine, doubtless, that their own system of affairs will endure forever.
                  Meanwhile, how full of its own proper life is the scene that lies around them! The
                  gray squirrel runs up the trees, and rustles among the upper branches. Was not
                  that the leap of a deer? And there is the whirr of a partridge! Methinks, too, I
                  catch the<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6669-00000032"/> cruel and stealthy eye of a
                  wolf, as he draws back into yonder impervious density of underbrush. So, there,
                  amid the murmur of boughs, go the Indian queen and the Indian priest; while the
                  gloom of the broad wilderness impends over them, and its sombre mystery invests
                  them as with something preternatural; and only momentary streaks of quivering
                  sunlight, once in a great while, find their way down, and glimmer among the
                  feathers in their dusky hair. Can it be that the thronged street of a city will
                  ever pass into this twilight solitude,—over those soft heaps of the decaying
                  tree-trunks, and through the swampy places, green with water-moss, and penetrate
                  that hopeless entanglement of great trees, which have been uprooted and tossed
                  together by a whirlwind? It has been a wilderness from the creation. Must it not
                  be a wilderness forever?</p>
               <p>Here an acidulous-looking gentleman in blue glasses, with bows of Berlin steel,
                  who has taken a seat at the extremity of the front row, begins, at this early
                  stage of the exhibition, to criticize.</p>
               <p>"The whole affair is a manifest catch-penny!" observes he, scarcely under his
                  breath. "The trees look more like weeds in a garden than a primitive forest; the
                  Squaw Sachem and Wappacowet are stiff in their pasteboard joints; and the
                  squirrels, the deer, and the wolf, move with all the grace of a child's wooden
                  monkey, sliding up and down a stick."</p>
               <p>"I am obliged to you, sir, for the candor of your remarks," replies the showman,
                  with a bow. "Perhaps they are just. Human art has its limits, and we must now and
                  then ask a little aid from the spectator's imagination."</p>
               <p>"You will get no such aid from mine," responds the critic. "I make it a point to
                  see things precisely as they are. But come! go ahead! the stage is waiting!"</p>
               <p>The showman proceeds.</p>
               <p>Casting our eyes again over the scene, we perceive that strangers have found their
                  way into the solitary place. In more than one spot, among the trees, an upheaved
                  axe is glittering in the sunshine. Roger Conant, the first settler in Naumkeag,
                  has built his dwelling, months ago, on the border of the forest-path; and at this
                  moment he comes eastward through the vista of woods, with his gun over his
                  shoulder, bringing home the choice portions of a deer. His stalwart figure, clad
                  in a leathern jerkin and breeches of the same, strides sturdily onward, with such
                  an air of physical force and energy that we might almost expect the very trees to
                  stand aside, and give him room to pass. And so, indeed, they must; for, humble as
                  is his name in history, Roger Conant still is of that class of men who do not
                  merely find, but make, their place in the system of human affairs; a man of
                  thoughtful strength, he has planted the germ of a city. There stands his
                  habitation, showing in its rough architecture some features of the Indian wigwam,
                  and some of the log cabin, and somewhat, too, of the straw-thatched cottage in Old
                  England, where this good yeoman had his birth and breeding. The dwelling is
                  surrounded by a cleared space of a few acres, where Indian corn grows thrivingly
                  among the stumps of the trees; while the dark forest hems it in, and seems to gaze
                  silently and solemnly, as if wondering at the breadth of sunshine which the white
                  man spreads around<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6669-00000033"/> him. An Indian, half
                  hidden in the dusky shade, is gazing and wondering too.</p>
               <p>Within the door of the cottage you discern the wife, with her ruddy English cheek.
                  She is singing, doubtless, a psalm tune, at her household work; or, perhaps she
                  sighs at the remembrance of the cheerful gossip, and all the merry social life, of
                  her native village beyond the vast and melancholy sea. Yet the next moment she
                  laughs, with sympathetic glee, at the sports of her little tribe of children; and
                  soon turns round, with the home-look in her face, as her husband's foot is heard
                  approaching the rough-hewn threshold. How sweet must it be for those who have an
                  Eden in their hearts, like Roger Conant and his wife, to find a new world to
                  project it into, as they have, instead of dwelling among old haunts of men, where
                  so many household fires have been kindled and burnt out, that the very glow of
                  happiness has something dreary in it! Not that this pair are alone in their wild
                  Eden, for here comes Goodwife Massey, the young spouse of Jeffrey Massey, from her
                  home hard by, with an infant at her breast. Dame Conant has another of like age;
                  and it shall hereafter be one of the disputed points of history which of these two
                  babies was the first town-born child.</p>
               <p>But see! Roger Conant has other neighbors within view. Peter Palfrey likewise has
                  built himself a house, and so has Balch, and Norman, and Woodbury. Their
                  dwellings, indeed,—such is the ingenious contrivance of this piece of pictorial
                  mechanism,—seem to have arisen, at various points of the scene, even while we have
                  been looking at it. The forest-track, trodden more and more by the hob-nailed
                  shoes of these sturdy and ponderous Englishmen, has now a distinctness which it
                  never could have acquired from the light tread of a hundred times as many Indian
                  moccasins. It will be a street, anon. As we observe it now, it goes onward from
                  one clearing to another, here plunging into a shadowy strip of woods, there open
                  to the sunshine, but everywhere showing a decided line, along which human
                  interests have begun to hold their career. Over yonder swampy spot, two trees have
                  been felled, and laid side by side, to make a causeway. In another place, the axe
                  has cleared away a confused intricacy of fallen trees and clustered boughs, which
                  had been tossed together by a hurricane. So now the little children, just
                  beginning to run alone, may trip along the path, and not often stumble over an
                  impediment, unless they stray from it to gather wood-berries beneath the trees.
                  And, besides the feet of grown people and children, there are the cloven hoofs of
                  a small herd of cows, who seek their subsistence from the native grasses, and help
                  to deepen the track of the future thoroughfare. Goats also browse along it, and
                  nibble at the twigs that thrust themselves across the way. Not seldom, in its more
                  secluded portions, where the black shadow of the forest strives to hide the trace
                  of human footsteps, stalks a gaunt wolf, on the watch for a kid or a young calf;
                  or fixes his hungry gaze on the group of children gathering berries, and can
                  hardly forbear to rush upon them. And the Indians, coming from their distant
                  wigwams to view the white man's settlement, marvel at the deep track which he
                  makes, and perhaps are saddened by a flitting presentiment that this heavy tread
                  will find its way over all the land; and that the wild woods, the wild wolf,<pb
                     n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6669-00000034"/> and the wild Indian, will alike be
                  trampled beneath it. Even so shall it be. The pavements of the Main-street must be
                  laid over the red man's grave.</p>
               <p>Behold! here is a spectacle which should be ushered in by the peal of trumpets, if
                  Naumkeag had ever yet heard that cheery music, and by the roar of cannon, echoing
                  among the woods. A procession,—for, by its dignity, as marking an epoch in the
                  history of the street, it deserves that name,—a procession advances along the
                  pathway. The good ship Abigail has arrived from England, bringing wares and
                  merchandise, for the comfort of the inhabitants, and traffic with the Indians;
                  bringing passengers too, and, more important than all, a governor for the new
                  settlement. Roger Conant and Peter Palfrey, with their companions, have been to
                  the shore to welcome him; and now, with such honor and triumph as their rude way
                  of life permits, are escorting the sea-flushed voyagers to their habitations. At
                  the point where Endicott enters upon the scene, two venerable trees unite their
                  branches high above his head; thus forming a triumphal arch of living verdure,
                  beneath which he pauses, with his wife leaning on his arm, to catch the first
                  impression of their new-found home. The old settlers gaze not less earnestly at
                  him, than he at the hoary woods and the rough surface of the clearings. They like
                  his bearded face, under the shadow of the broad-brimmed and steeple-crowned
                  Puritan hat;—a visage resolute, grave, and thoughtful, yet apt to kindle with that
                  glow of a cheerful spirit by which men of strong character are enabled to go
                  joyfully on their proper tasks. His form, too, as you see it, in a doublet and
                  hose of sad-colored cloth, is of a manly make, fit for toil and hardship, and fit
                  to wield the heavy sword that hangs from his leathern belt. His aspect is a better
                  warrant for the ruler's office than the parchment commission which he bears,
                  however fortified it may be with the broad seal of the London council. Peter
                  Palfrey nods to Roger Conant. "The worshipful Court of Assistants have done
                  wisely," say they between themselves. "They have chosen for our governor a man out
                  of a thousand." Then they toss up their hats,—they, and all the uncouth figures of
                  their company, most of whom are clad in skins, inasmuch as their old kersey and
                  linsey-woolsey garments have been torn and tattered by many a long month's
                  wear,—they all toss up their hats, and salute their new governor and captain with
                  a hearty English shout of welcome. We seem to hear it with our own ears, so
                  perfectly is the action represented in this life-like, this almost magic
                  picture!</p>
               <p>But have you observed the lady who leans upon the arm of Endicott?—a rose of
                  beauty from an English garden, now to be transplanted to a fresher soil. It may be
                  that, long years—centuries, indeed—after this fair flower shall have decayed,
                  other flowers of the same race will appear in the same soil, and gladden other
                  generations with hereditary beauty. Does not the vision haunt us yet? Has not
                  Nature kept the mould unbroken, deeming it a pity that the idea should vanish from
                  mortal sight forever, after only once assuming earthly substance? Do we not
                  recognize, in that fair woman's face, the model of features which still beam, at
                  happy moments, on what was then the woodland pathway, but has long since grown
                  into a busy street?</p>
               <p>"This is too ridiculous!—positively insufferable!"<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000035"/> mutters the same critic who had before expressed
                  his disapprobation. "Here is a pasteboard figure, such as a child would cut out of
                  a card, with a pair of very dull scissors; and the fellow modestly requests us to
                  see in it the prototype of hereditary beauty!"</p>
               <p>"But, sir, you have not the proper point of view," remarks the showman. "You sit
                  altogether too near to get the best effect of my pictorial exhibition. Pray,
                  oblige me by removing to this other bench, and I venture to assure you the proper
                  light and shadow will transform the spectacle into quite another thing."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw!" replies the critic: "I want no other light and shade. I have already told
                  you that it is my business to see things just as they are."</p>
               <p>"I would suggest to the author of this ingenious exhibition," observes a
                  gentlemanly person, who has shown signs of being much interested, "I would
                  suggest, that Anna Gower, the first wife of Governor Endicott, and who came with
                  him from England, left no posterity; and that, consequently, we cannot be indebted
                  to that honorable lady for any specimens of feminine loveliness now extant among
                  us."</p>
               <p>Having nothing to allege against this genealogical objection, the showman points
                  again to the scene.</p>
               <p>During this little interruption, you perceive that the Anglo-Saxon energy—as the
                  phrase now goes—has been at work in the spectacle before us. So many chimneys now
                  send up their smoke, that it begins to have the aspect of a village street;
                  although everything is so inartificial and inceptive, that it seems as if one
                  returning wave of the wild nature might overwhelm it all. But the one edifice
                  which gives the pledge of permanence nence to this bold enterprise is seen at the
                  central point of the picture. There stands the meeting-house, a small structure,
                  low-roofed, without a spire, and built of rough timber, newly hewn, with the sap
                  still in the logs, and here and there a strip of bark adhering to them. A meaner
                  temple was never consecrated to the worship of the Deity. With the alternative of
                  kneeling beneath the awful vault of the firmament, it is strange that men should
                  creep into this pent-up nook, and expect God's presence there. Such, at least, one
                  would imagine, might be the feeling of these forest-settlers, accustomed, as they
                  had been, to stand under the dim arches of vast cathedrals, and to offer up their
                  hereditary worship in the old, ivy-covered churches of rural England, around which
                  lay the bones of many generations of their forefathers. How could they dispense
                  with the carved altar-work?—how, with the pictured windows, where the light of
                  common day was hallowed by being transmitted through the glorified figures of
                  saints?—how, with the lofty roof, imbued, as it must have been, with the prayers
                  that had gone upward for centuries?—how, with the rich peal of the solemn organ,
                  rolling along the aisles, pervading the whole church, and sweeping the soul away
                  on a flood of audible religion? They needed nothing of all this. Their house of
                  worship, like their ceremonial, was naked, simple, and severe. But the zeal of a
                  recovered faith burned like a lamp within their hearts, enriching everything
                  around them with its radiance; making of these new walls, and this narrow compass,
                  its own cathedral; and being, in itself, that spiritual mystery and experience, of
                  which sacred architecture, pictured windows<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6669-00000036"
                  /> dows, and the organ's grand solemnity, are remote and imperfect symbols. All
                  was well, so long as their lamps were freshly kindled at the heavenly flame. After
                  a while, however, whether in their time or their children's, these lamps began to
                  burn more dimly, or with a less genuine lustre; and then it might be seen how
                  hard, cold and confined, was their system,—how like an iron cage was that which
                  they called Liberty.</p>
               <p>Too much of this. Look again at the picture, and observe how the aforesaid
                  Anglo-Saxon energy is now trampling along the street, and raising a positive cloud
                  of dust beneath its sturdy footsteps. For there the carpenters are building a new
                  house, the frame of which was hewn and fitted in England, of English oak, and sent
                  hither on shipboard; and here a blacksmith makes huge clang and clatter on his
                  anvil, shaping out tools and weapons; and yonder a wheelwright, who boasts himself
                  a London workman, regularly bred to his handicraft, is fashioning a set of
                  wagon-wheels, the track of which shall soon be visible. The wild forest is
                  shrinking back; the street has lost the aromatic odor of the pine-trees, and of
                  the sweet fern that grew beneath them. The tender and modest wild-flowers, those
                  gentle children of savage nature that grew pale beneath the ever-brooding shade,
                  have shrunk away and disappeared, like stars that vanish in the breadth of light.
                  Gardens are fenced in, and display pumpkin-beds and rows of cabbages and beans;
                  and, though the governor and the minister both view them with a disapproving eye,
                  plants of broad-leaved tobacco, which the cultivators are enjoined to use privily,
                  or not at all. No wolf, for a year past, has been heard to bark, or known to range
                  among the dwellings ings, except that single one, whose grisly head, with a plash
                  of blood beneath it, is now affixed to the portal of the meeting-house. The
                  partridge has ceased to run across the too-frequented path. Of all the wild life
                  that used to throng here, only the Indians still come into the settlement,
                  bringing the skins of beaver and otter, bear and elk, which they sell to Endicott
                  for the wares of England. And there is little John Massey, the son of Jeffrey
                  Massey and first-born of Naumkeag, playing beside his father's threshold, a child
                  of six or seven years old. Which is the better-grown infant,—the town or the
                  boy?</p>
               <p>The red men have become aware that the street is no longer free to them, save by
                  the sufferance and permission of the settlers. Often, to impress them with an awe
                  of English power, there is a muster and training of the town-forces, and a stately
                  march of the mail-clad band, like this which we now see advancing up the street.
                  There they come, fifty of them, or more; all with their iron breastplates and
                  steel caps well burnished, and glimmering bravely against the sun; their ponderous
                  muskets on their shoulders, their bandaliers about their waists, their lighted
                  matches in their hands, and the drum and fife playing cheerily before them. See!
                  do they not step like martial men? Do they not manœuvre like soldiers who have
                  seen stricken fields? And well they may; for this band is composed of precisely
                  such materials as those with which Cromwell is preparing to beat down the strength
                  of a kingdom; and his famous regiment of Ironsides might be recruited from just
                  such men. In everything, at this period, New England was the essential spirit and
                  flower of that which was about to become uppermost in the mother-country.<pb
                     n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6669-00000037"/> Many a bold and wise man lost the fame
                  which would have accrued to him in English history, by crossing the Atlantic with
                  our forefathers. Many a valiant captain, who might have been foremost at Marston
                  Moor or Naseby, exhausted his martial ardor in the command of a log-built
                  fortress, like that which you observe on the gently rising ground at the right of
                  the pathway,—its banner fluttering in the breeze, and the culverins and sakers
                  showing their deadly muzzles over the rampart.</p>
               <p>A multitude of people were now thronging to New England: some, because the ancient
                  and ponderous frame-work of Church and State threatened to crumble down upon their
                  heads; others, because they despaired of such a downfall. Among those who came to
                  Naumkeag were men of history and legend, whose feet leave a track of brightness
                  along any pathway which they have trodden. You shall behold their life-like
                  images,—their spectres, if you choose so to call them,—passing, encountering with
                  a familiar nod, stopping to converse together, praying, bearing weapons, laboring
                  or resting from their labors, in the Main-street. Here, now, comes Hugh Peters, an
                  earnest, restless man, walking swiftly, as being impelled by that fiery activity
                  of nature which shall hereafter thrust him into the conflict of dangerous affairs,
                  make him the chaplain and counsellor of Cromwell, and finally bring him to a
                  bloody end. He pauses, by the meeting-house, to exchange a greeting with Roger
                  Williams, whose face indicates, methinks, a gentler spirit, kinder and more
                  expansive, than that of Peters; yet not less active for what he discerns to be the
                  will of God, or the welfare of mankind. And look! here is a guest for Endicott,
                  coming forth out of the forest, through which he has been journeying from Boston,
                  and which, with its rude branches, has caught hold of his attire, and has wet his
                  feet with its swamps and streams. Still there is something in his mild and
                  venerable, though not aged presence,—a propriety, an equilibrium, in Governor
                  Winthrop's nature,—that causes the disarray of his costume to be unnoticed, and
                  gives us the same impression as if he were clad in such grave and rich attire as
                  we may suppose him to have worn in the Council-chamber of the colony. Is not this
                  characteristic wonderfully perceptible in our spectral representative of his
                  person? But what dignitary is this crossing from the other side to greet the
                  governor? A stately personage, in a dark velvet cloak, with a hoary beard, and a
                  gold chain across his breast; he has the authoritative port of one who has filled
                  the highest civic station in the first of cities. Of all men in the world, we
                  should least expect to meet the Lord Mayor of London—as Sir Richard Saltonstall
                  has been, once and again—in a forest-bordered settlement of the western
                  wilderness.</p>
               <p>Further down the street, we see Emanuel Downing, a grave and worthy citizen, with
                  his son George, a stripling who has a career before him; his shrewd and quick
                  capacity and pliant conscience shall not only exalt him high, but secure him from
                  a downfall. Here is another figure, on whose characteristic make and expressive
                  action I will stake the credit of my pictorial puppet-show. Have you not already
                  detected a quaint, sly humor in that face,—an eccentricity in the manner,—a
                  certain indescribable waywardness,—all the marks, in short, of an original man,
                  unmistakably impressed, yet<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6669-00000038"/> kept down by
                  a sense of clerical restraint? That is Nathaniel Ward, the minister of Ipswich,
                  but better remembered as the simple cobbler of Agawam. He hammered his sole so
                  faithfully, and stitched his upper-leather so well, that the shoe is hardly yet
                  worn out, though thrown aside for some two centuries past. And next, among these
                  Puritans and Roundheads, we observe the very model of a Cavalier, with the curling
                  lovelock, the fantastically trimmed beard, the embroidery, the ornamented rapier,
                  the gilded dagger, and all other foppishnesses that distinguished the wild
                  gallants who rode headlong to their overthrow in the cause of King Charles. This
                  is Morton of Merry Mount, who has come hither to hold a council with Endicott, but
                  will shortly be his prisoner. Yonder pale, decaying figure of a white-robed woman,
                  who glides slowly along the street, is the Lady Arabella, looking for her own
                  grave in the virgin soil. That other female form, who seems to be talking—we might
                  almost say preaching or expounding—in the centre of a group of profoundly
                  attentive auditors, is Ann Hutchinson. And here comes Vane.——</p>
               <p>"But, my dear sir," interrupts the same gentleman who before questioned the
                  showman's genealogical accuracy, "allow me to observe that these historical
                  personages could not possibly have met together in the Main-street. They might,
                  and probably did, all visit our old town, at one time or another, but not
                  simultaneously; and you have fallen into anachronisms that I positively shudder to
                  think of!"</p>
               <p>"The fellow," adds the scarcely civil critic, "has learned a bead-roll of historic
                  names, whom he lugs into his pictorial puppet-show, as he calls it,
                  helter-skelter, without caring whether they were contemporaries or not,—and sets
                  them all by the ears together. But was there ever such a fund of impudence? To
                  hear his running commentary, you would suppose that these miserable slips of
                  painted pasteboard, with hardly the remotest outlines of the human figure, had all
                  the character and expression of Michael Angelo's pictures. Well! go on, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Sir, you break the illusion of the scene," mildly remonstrates the showman.</p>
               <p>"Illusion! What illusion?" rejoins the critic, with a contemptuous snort. "On the
                  word of a gentleman, I see nothing illusive in the wretchedly bedaubed sheet of
                  canvas that forms your back-ground, or in these pasteboard slips that hitch and
                  jerk along the front. The only illusion, permit me to say, is in the
                  puppet-showman's tongue,—and that but a wretched one, into the bargain!"</p>
               <p>"We public men," replies the showman, meekly, "must lay our account, sometimes, to
                  meet an uncandid severity of criticism. But—merely for your own pleasure, sir—let
                  me entreat you to take another point of view. Sit further back, by that young
                  lady, in whose face I have watched the reflection of every changing scene; only
                  oblige me by sitting there; and, take my word for it, the slips of pasteboard
                  shall assume spiritual life, and the bedaubed canvas become an airy and changeable
                  reflex of what it purports to represent."</p>
               <p>"I know better," retorts the critic, settling himself in his seat, with sullen but
                  self-complacent immovableness.<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6669-00000039"/> "And, as
                  for my own pleasure, I shall best consult it by remaining precisely where I
                  am."</p>
               <p>The showman bows, and waves his hand; and, at the signal, as if time and
                  vicissitude had been awaiting his permission to move onward, the mimic street
                  becomes alive again.</p>
               <p>Years have rolled over our scene, and converted the forest-track into a dusty
                  thoroughfare, which, being intersected with lanes and cross-paths, may fairly be
                  designated as the Main-street. On the ground-sites of many of the log-built sheds,
                  into which the first settlers crept for shelter, houses of quaint architecture
                  have now risen. These later edifices are built, as you see, in one generally
                  accordant style, though with such subordinate variety as keeps the beholder's
                  curiosity excited, and causes each structure, like its owner's character, to
                  produce its own peculiar impression. Most of them have one huge chimney in the
                  centre, with flues so vast that it must have been easy for the witches to fly out
                  of them, as they were wont to do, when bound on an aërial visit to the Black Man
                  in the forest. Around this great chimney the wooden house clusters itself, in a
                  whole community of gable-ends, each ascending into its own separate peak; the
                  second story, with its lattice-windows, projecting over the first; and the door,
                  which is perhaps arched, provided on the outside with an iron hammer, wherewith
                  the visiter's hand may give a thundering rat-a-tat. The timber frame-work of these
                  houses, as compared with those of recent date, is like the skeleton of an old
                  giant, beside the frail bones of a modern man of fashion. Many of them, by the
                  vast strength and soundness of their oaken substance, have been preserved through
                  a length of time which would have tried the stability of brick and stone; so that,
                  in all the progressive decay and continual reconstruction of the street, down to
                  our own days, we shall still behold these old edifices occupying their
                  long-accustomed sites. For instance, on the upper corner of that green lane which
                  shall hereafter be North-street, we see the Curwen House, newly built, with the
                  carpenters still at work on the roof, nailing down the last sheaf of shingles. On
                  the lower corner stands another dwelling,—destined, at some period of its
                  existence, to be the abode of an unsuccessful alchemist,—which shall likewise
                  survive to our own generation, and perhaps long outlive it. Thus, through the
                  medium of these patriarchal edifices, we have now established a sort of kindred
                  and hereditary acquaintance with the Main-street.</p>
               <p>Great as is the transformation produced by a short term of years, each single day
                  creeps through the Puritan settlement sluggishly enough. It shall pass before your
                  eyes, condensed into the space of a few moments. The gray light of early morning
                  is slowly diffusing itself over the scene; and the bellman, whose office it is to
                  cry the hour at the street-corners, rings the last peal upon his hand-bell, and
                  goes wearily homewards, with the owls, the bats, and other creatures of the night.
                  Lattices are thrust back on their hinges, as if the town were opening its eyes, in
                  the summer morning. Forth stumbles the still drowsy cow-herd, with his horn;
                  putting which to his lips, it emits a bellowing bray, impossible to be represented
                  in the picture, but which reaches the pricked-up ears of every cow in the
                  settlement, and tells her that the dewy pasture-hour is come. House after<pb
                     n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6669-00000040"/> house awakes, and sends the smoke up
                  curling from its chimney, like frosty breath from living nostrils; and as those
                  white wreaths of smoke, though impregnated with earthy admixtures, climb skyward,
                  so, from each dwelling, does the morning worship—its spiritual essence bearing up
                  its human imperfection—find its way to the heavenly Father's throne.</p>
               <p>The breakfast-hour being passed, the inhabitants do not, as usual, go to their
                  fields or workshops, but remain within door; or perhaps walk the street, with a
                  grave sobriety, yet a disengaged and unburthened aspect, that belongs neither to a
                  holiday nor a Sabbath. And, indeed, this passing day is neither, nor is it a
                  common week-day, although partaking of all the three. It is the Thursday Lecture;
                  an institution which New England has long ago relinquished, and almost forgotten,
                  yet which it would have been better to retain, as bearing relations to both the
                  spiritual and ordinary life, and bringing each acquainted with the other. The
                  tokens of its observance, however, which here meet our eyes, are of rather a
                  questionable cast. It is, in one sense, a day of public shame; the day on which
                  transgressors, who have made themselves liable to the minor severities of the
                  Puritan law, receive their reward of ignominy. At this very moment, the constable
                  has bound an idle fellow to the whipping-post, and is giving him his deserts with
                  a cat-o'-nine-tails. Ever since sunrise, Daniel Fairfield has been standing on the
                  steps of the meeting-house, with a halter about his neck, which he is condemned to
                  wear visibly throughout his lifetime; Dorothy Talby is chained to a post at the
                  corner of Prison-lane, with the hot sun blazing on her matronly face, and all for
                  no other offence than lifting her hand against her husband; while, through the
                  bars of that great wooden cage, in the centre of the scene, we discern either a
                  human being or a wild beast, or both in one, whom this public infamy causes to
                  roar, and gnash his teeth, and shake the strong oaken bars, as if he would break
                  forth, and tear in pieces the little children who have been peeping at him. Such
                  are the profitable sights that serve the good people to while away the earlier
                  part of lecture-day. Betimes in the forenoon, a traveller—the first traveller that
                  has come hitherward this morning—rides slowly into the street, on his patient
                  steed. He seems a clergyman; and, as he draws near, we recognize the minister of
                  Lynn, who was preengaged to lecture here, and has been revolving his discourse, as
                  he rode through the hoary wilderness. Behold, now, the whole town thronging into
                  the meeting-house, mostly with such sombre visages that the sunshine becomes
                  little better than a shadow when it falls upon them. There go the Thirteen Men,
                  grim rulers of a grim community! There goes John Massey, the first town-born
                  child, now a youth of twenty, whose eye wanders with peculiar interest towards
                  that buxom damsel who comes up the steps at the same instant. There hobbles Goody
                  Foster, a sour and bitter old beldam, looking as if she went to curse, and not to
                  pray, and whom many of her neighbors suspect of taking an occasional airing on a
                  broomstick. There, too, slinking shamefacedly in, you observe that same poor
                  do-nothing and good-for-nothing whom we saw castigated just now at the
                  whipping-post. Last of all, there goes the tithing-man, lugging in a couple of
                  small boys, whom he has<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6669-00000041"/> caught at play
                  beneath God's blessed sunshine, in a back lane. What native of Naumkeag, whose
                  recollections go back more than thirty years, does not still shudder at that dark
                  ogre of his infancy, who perhaps had long ceased to have an actual existence, but
                  still lived in his childish belief, in a horrible idea, and in the nurse's threat,
                  as the Tidy Man!</p>
               <p>It will be hardly worth our while to wait two, or it may be three, turnings of the
                  hour-glass, for the conclusion of the lecture. Therefore, by my control over light
                  and darkness, I cause the dusk, and then the starless night, to brood over the
                  street; and summon forth again the bellman, with his lantern casting a gleam about
                  his footsteps, to pace wearily from corner to corner, and shout drowsily the hour
                  to drowsy or dreaming ears. Happy are we, if for nothing else, yet because we did
                  not live in those days. In truth, when the first novelty and stir of spirit had
                  subsided,—when the new settlement, between the forest-border and the sea, had
                  become actually a little town,—its daily life must have trudged onward with hardly
                  anything to diversify and enliven it, while also its rigidity could not fail to
                  cause miserable distortions of the moral nature. Such a life was sinister to the
                  intellect, and sinister to the heart; especially when one generation had
                  bequeathed its religious gloom, and the counterfeit of its religious ardor, to the
                  next; for these characteristics, as was inevitable, assumed the form both of
                  hypocrisy and exaggeration, by being inherited from the example and precept of
                  other human beings, and not from an original and spiritual source. The sons and
                  grandchildren of the first settlers were a race of lower and narrower souls than
                  their progenitors had been. The latter were stern, severe, intolerant, but not
                  superstitious, not even fanatical; and endowed, if any men of that age were, with
                  a far-seeing worldly sagacity. But it was impossible for the succeeding race to
                  grow up, in heaven's freedom, beneath the discipline which their gloomy energy of
                  character had established; nor, it may be, have we even yet thrown off all the
                  unfavorable influences which, among many good ones, were bequeathed to us by our
                  Puritan forefathers. Let us thank God for having given us such ancestors; and let
                  each successive generation thank him, not less fervently, for being one step
                  further from them in the march of ages.</p>
               <p>"What is all this?" cries the critic. "A sermon? If so, it is not in the
                  bill."</p>
               <p>"Very true," replies the showman; "and I ask pardon of the audience."</p>
               <p>Look now at the street, and observe a strange people entering it. Their garments
                  are torn and disordered, their faces haggard, their figures emaciated; for they
                  have made their way hither through pathless deserts, suffering hunger and
                  hardship, with no other shelter than a hollow tree, the lair of a wild beast, or
                  an Indian wigwam. Nor, in the most inhospitable and dangerous of such
                  lodging-places, was there half the peril that awaits them in this thoroughfare of
                  Christian men, with those secure dwellings and warm hearths on either side of it,
                  and yonder meeting-house as the central object of the scene. These wanderers have
                  received from Heaven a gift that, in all epochs of the world, has brought with it
                  the penalties of mortal suffering and persecution, scorn, enmity, and death
                  itself;—a gift that, thus terrible to its<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6669-00000042"/>
                  possessors, has ever been most hateful to all other men, since its very existence
                  seems to threaten the overthrow of whatever else the toilsome ages have built
                  up;—the gift of a new idea. You can discern it in them, illuminating their
                  faces—their whole persons, indeed, however earthly and cloddish—with a light that
                  inevitably shines through, and makes the startled community aware that these men
                  are not as they themselves are,—not brethren nor neighbors of their thought.
                  Forthwith, it is as if an earthquake rumbled through the town, making its
                  vibrations felt at every hearthstone, and especially causing the spire of the
                  meeting-house to totter. The Quakers have come. We are in peril! See! they trample
                  upon our wise and well-established laws in the person of our chief magistrate; for
                  Governor Endicott is passing, now an aged man, and dignified with long habits of
                  authority,—and not one of the irreverent vagabonds has moved his hat. Did you note
                  the ominous frown of the white-bearded Puritan governor, as he turned himself
                  about, and, in his anger, half uplifted the staff that has become a needful
                  support to his old age? Here comes old Mr. Norris, our venerable minister. Will
                  they doff their hats, and pay reverence to him? No: their hats stick fast to their
                  ungracious heads, as if they grew there; and—impious varlets that they are, and
                  worse than the heathen Indians!—they eye our reverend pastor with a peculiar
                  scorn, distrust, unbelief, and utter denial of his sanctified pretensions, of
                  which he himself immediately becomes conscious; the more bitterly conscious, as he
                  never knew nor dreamed of the like before.</p>
               <p>But look yonder! Can we believe our eyes? A Quaker woman, clad in sackcloth, and
                  with ashes on her head, has mounted the steps of the meeting-house. She addresses
                  the people in a wild, shrill voice,—wild and shrill it must be, to suit such a
                  figure,—which makes them tremble and turn pale, although they crowd open-mouthed
                  to hear her. She is bold against established authority; she denounces the priest
                  and his steeple-house. Many of her hearers are appalled; some weep; and others
                  listen with a rapt attention, as if a living truth had now, for the first time,
                  forced its way through the crust of habit, reached their hearts, and awakened them
                  to life. This matter must be looked to; else we have brought our faith across the
                  seas with us in vain; and it had been better that the old forest were still
                  standing here, waving its tangled boughs, and murmuring to the sky out of its
                  desolate recesses, instead of this goodly street, if such blasphemies be spoken in
                  it.</p>
               <p>So thought the old Puritans. What was their mode of action may be partly judged
                  from the spectacles which now pass before your eyes. Joshua Buffum is standing in
                  the pillory. Cassandra Southwick is led to prison. And there a woman,—it is Ann
                  Coleman,—naked from the waist upward, and bound to the tail of a cart, is dragged
                  through the Main-street at the pace of a brisk walk, while the constable follows
                  with a whip of knotted cords. A strong-armed fellow is that constable; and each
                  time that he flourishes his lash in the air, you see a frown wrinkling and
                  twisting his brow, and, at the same instant, a smile upon his lips. He loves his
                  business, faithful officer that he is, and puts his soul into every stroke,
                  zealous to fulfil the injunction of Major Hawthorne's warrant, in the spirit and
                  to the letter.<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6669-00000043"/> There came down a stroke
                  that has drawn blood! Ten such stripes are to be given in Salem, ten in Boston,
                  and ten in Dedham; and, with those thirty stripes of blood upon her, she is to be
                  driven into the forest. The crimson trail goes wavering along the Main-street; but
                  Heaven grant that, as the rain of so many years has wept upon it, time after time,
                  and washed it all away, so there may have been a dew of mercy, to cleanse this
                  cruel blood-stain out of the record of the persecutor's life!</p>
               <p>Pass on, thou spectral constable, and betake thee to thine own place of torment.
                  Meanwhile, by the silent operation of the mechanism behind the scenes, a
                  considerable space of time would seem to have lapsed over the street. The older
                  dwellings now begin to look weather-beaten, through the effect of the many eastern
                  storms that have moistened their unpainted shingles and clapboards, for not less
                  than forty years. Such is the age we would assign to the town, judging by the
                  aspect of John Massey, the first town-born child, whom his neighbors now call
                  Goodman Massey, and whom we see yonder, a grave, almost autumnal-looking man, with
                  children of his own about him. To the patriarchs of the settlement, no doubt, the
                  Main-street is still but an affair of yesterday, hardly more antique, even if
                  destined to be more permanent, than a path shovelled through the snow. But to the
                  middle-aged and elderly men who came hither in childhood or early youth, it
                  presents the aspect of a long and well-established work, on which they have
                  expended the strength and ardor of their life. And the younger people, native to
                  the street, whose earliest recollections are of creeping over the paternal
                  threshold, and rolling on the grassy margin of the track, look at it as one of the
                  perdurable things of our mortal state,—as old as the hills of the great pasture,
                  or the headland at the harbor's mouth. Their fathers and grandsires tell them how,
                  within a few years past, the forest stood here, with but a lonely track beneath
                  its tangled shade. Vain legend! They cannot make it true and real to their
                  conceptions. With them, moreover, the Main-street is a street indeed, worthy to
                  hold its way with the thronged and stately avenues of cities beyond the sea. The
                  old Puritans tell them of the crowds that hurry along Cheapside and Fleet-street
                  and the Strand, and of the rush of tumultuous life at Temple Bar. They describe
                  London Bridge, itself a street, with a row of houses on each side. They speak of
                  the vast structure of the Tower, and the solemn grandeur of Westminster Abbey. The
                  children listen, and still inquire if the streets of London are longer and broader
                  than the one before their father's door; if the Tower is bigger than the jail in
                  Prison-lane; if the old Abbey will hold a larger congregation than our
                  meeting-house. Nothing impresses them, except their own experience.</p>
               <p>It seems all a fable, too, that wolves have ever prowled here; and not less so,
                  that the Squaw Sachem, and the Sagamore her son, once ruled over this region, and
                  treated as sovereign potentates with the English settlers, then so few and
                  storm-beaten, now so powerful. There stand some school-boys, you observe, in a
                  little group around a drunken Indian, himself a prince of the Squaw Sachem's
                  lineage. He brought hither some beaver-skins for sale, and has already swallowed
                  the larger portion of their price, in deadly draughts of fire-water<pb n="90-91"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000044"/> water. Is there not a touch of pathos in that
                  picture? and does it not go far towards telling the whole story of the vast growth
                  and prosperity of one race, and the fated decay of another?—the children of the
                  stranger making game of the great Squaw Sachem's grandson!</p>
               <p>But the whole race of red men have not vanished with that wild princess and her
                  posterity. This march of soldiers along the street betokens the breaking out of
                  King Philip's war; and these young men, the flower of Essex, are on their way to
                  defend the villages on the Connecticut; where, at Bloody Brook, a terrible blow
                  shall be smitten, and hardly one of that gallant band be left alive. And there, at
                  that stately mansion, with its three peaks in front, and its two little peaked
                  towers, one on either side of the door, we see brave Captain Gardner issuing
                  forth, clad in his embroidered buff-coat, and his plumed cap upon his head. His
                  trusty sword, in its steel scabbard, strikes clanking on the door-step. See how
                  the people throng to their doors and windows, as the cavalier rides past, reining
                  his mettled steed so gallantly, and looking so like the very soul and emblem of
                  martial achievement,—destined, too, to meet a warrior's fate, at the desperate
                  assault on the fortress of the Narragansetts!</p>
               <p>"The mettled steed looks like a pig," interrupts the critic, "and Captain Gardner
                  himself like the devil, though a very tame one, and on a most diminutive
                  scale."</p>
               <p>"Sir, sir!" cries the persecuted showman, losing all patience,—for, indeed, he had
                  particularly prided himself on these figures of Captain Gardner and his horse,—"I
                  see that there is no hope of pleasing you. Pray, sir, do me the favor to take back
                  your money, and withdraw!"</p>
               <p>"Not I!" answers the unconscionable critic. "I am just beginning to get interested
                  in the matter. Come! turn your crank, and grind out a few more of these
                  fooleries!"</p>
               <p>The showman rubs his brow impulsively, whisks the little rod with which he points
                  out the notabilities of the scene,—but, finally, with the inevitable acquiescence
                  of all public servants, resumes his composure, and goes on.</p>
               <p>Pass onward, onward, Time! Build up new houses here, and tear down thy works of
                  yesterday, that have already the rusty moss upon them! Summon forth the minister
                  to the abode of the young maiden, and bid him unite her to the joyful bridegroom!
                  Let the youthful parents carry their first-born to the meeting-house, to receive
                  the baptismal rite! Knock at the door, whence the sable line of the funeral is
                  next to issue! Provide other successive generations of men, to trade, talk,
                  quarrel, or walk in friendly intercourse along the street, as their fathers did
                  before them! Do all thy daily and accustomed business, Father Time, in this
                  thoroughfare, which thy footsteps, for so many years, have now made dusty! But
                  here, at last, thou leadest along a procession which, once witnessed, shall appear
                  no more, and be remembered only as a hideous dream of thine, or a frenzy of thy
                  old brain.</p>
               <p>"Turn your crank, I say," bellows the remorseless critic, "and grind it out,
                  whatever it be, without further preface!"</p>
               <p>The showman deems it best to comply.</p>
               <p>Then, here comes the worshipful Captain Curwen,<pb n="92-93"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000045"/> sheriff of Essex, on horseback, at the head of an
                  armed guard, escorting a company of condemned prisoners from the jail to their
                  place of execution on Gallows Hill. The witches! There is no mistaking them! The
                  witches! As they approach up Prison-lane, and turn into the Main-street, let us
                  watch their faces, as if we made a part of the pale crowd that presses so eagerly
                  about them, yet shrinks back with such shuddering dread, leaving an open passage
                  betwixt a dense throng on either side. Listen to what the people say.</p>
               <p>There is old George Jacobs, known hereabouts, these sixty years, as a man whom we
                  thought upright in all his way of life, quiet, blameless, a good husband before
                  his pious wife was summoned from the evil to come, and a good father to the
                  children whom she left him. Ah! but when that blessed woman went to heaven, George
                  Jacobs' heart was empty, his hearth lonely, his life broken up; his children were
                  married, and betook themselves to habitations of their own; and Satan, in his
                  wanderings up and down, beheld this forlorn old man, to whom life was a sameness
                  and a weariness, and found the way to tempt him. So the miserable sinner was
                  prevailed with to mount into the air, and career among the clouds; and he is
                  proved to have been present at a witch-meeting as far off as Falmouth, on the very
                  same night that his next neighbors saw him, with his rheumatic stoop, going in at
                  his own door. There is John Willard, too; an honest man we thought him, and so
                  shrewd and active in his business, so practical, so intent on every-day affairs,
                  so constant at his little place of trade, where he bartered English goods for
                  Indian corn and all kinds of country produce! How could such a man find time, or
                  what could put it into his mind, to leave his proper calling, and become a wizard?
                  It is a mystery, unless the Black Man tempted him with great heaps of gold. See
                  that aged couple,—a sad sight, truly,—John Proctor, and his wife Elizabeth. If
                  there were two old people in all the County of Essex who seemed to have led a true
                  Christian life, and to be treading hopefully the little remnant of their earthly
                  path, it was this very pair. Yet have we heard it sworn, to the satisfaction of
                  the worshipful Chief-justice Sewell, and all the court and jury, that Proctor and
                  his wife have shown their withered faces at children's bedsides, mocking, making
                  mouths, and affrighting the poor little innocents in the night-time. They, or
                  their spectral appearances, have stuck pins into the afflicted ones, and thrown
                  them into deadly fainting-fits with a touch, or but a look. And, while we supposed
                  the old man to be reading the Bible to his old wife,—she meanwhile knitting in the
                  chimney-corner,—the pair of hoary reprobates have whisked up the chimney, both on
                  one broomstick, and flown away to a witch-communion, far into the depths of the
                  chill, dark forest. How foolish! Were it only for fear of rheumatic pains in their
                  old bones, they had better have stayed at home. But away they went; and the
                  laughter of their decayed, cackling voices has been heard at midnight, aloft in
                  the air. Now, in the sunny noontide, as they go tottering to the gallows, it is
                  the devil's turn to laugh.</p>
               <p>Behind these two,—who help another along, and seem to be comforting and
                  encouraging each other, in a manner truly pitiful, if it were not a sin to pity
                  the old witch and wizard,—behind them comes a woman, with<pb n="94-95"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000046"/> a dark, proud face that has been beautiful, and a
                  figure that is still majestic. Do you know her? It is Martha Carrier, whom the
                  devil found in a humble cottage, and looked into her discontented heart, and saw
                  pride there, and tempted her with his promise that she should be Queen of Hell.
                  And now, with that lofty demeanor, she is passing to her kingdom, and, by her
                  unquenchable pride, transforms this escort of shame into a triumphal procession,
                  that shall attend her to the gates of her infernal palace, and seat her upon the
                  fiery throne. Within this hour, she shall assume her royal dignity.</p>
               <p>Last of the miserable train comes a man clad in black, of small stature and a dark
                  complexion, with a clerical band about his neck. Many a time, in the years gone
                  by, that face has been uplifted heavenward from the pulpit of the East
                  Meeting-house, when the Rev. Mr. Burroughs seemed to worship God. What!—he? The
                  holy man!—the learned!—the wise! How has the devil tempted him? His
                  fellow-criminals, for the most part, are obtuse, uncultivated creatures, some of
                  them scarcely half-witted by nature, and others greatly decayed in their
                  intellects through age. They were an easy prey for the destroyer. Not so with this
                  George Burroughs, as we judge by the inward light which glows through his dark
                  countenance, and, we might almost say, glorifies his figure, in spite of the soil
                  and haggardness of long imprisonment,—in spite of the heavy shadow that must fall
                  on him, while death is walking by his side. What bribe could Satan offer, rich
                  enough to tempt and overcome this man? Alas! it may have been in the very strength
                  of his high and searching intellect, that the Tempter found the weakness which
                  betrayed him. He yearned for knowledge; he went groping onward into a world of
                  mystery; at first, as the witnesses have sworn, he summoned up the ghosts of his
                  two dead wives, and talked with them of matters beyond the grave; and, when their
                  responses failed to satisfy the intense and sinful craving of his spirit, he
                  called on Satan, and was heard. Yet,—to look at him,—who, that had not known the
                  proof, could believe him guilty? Who would not say, while we see him offering
                  comfort to the weak and aged partners of his horrible crime,—while we hear his
                  ejaculations of prayer, that seem to bubble up out of the depths of his heart, and
                  fly heaven-ward, unawares,—while we behold a radiance brightening on his features
                  as from the other world, which is but a few steps off,—who would not say, that,
                  over the dusty track of the Main-street, a Christian saint is now going to a
                  martyr's death? May not the Arch Fiend have been too subtle for the court and
                  jury, and betrayed them—laughing in his sleeve, the while—into the awful error of
                  pouring out sanctified blood as an acceptable sacrifice upon God's altar? Ah! no;
                  for listen to wise Cotton Mather, who, as he sits there on his horse, speaks
                  comfortably to the perplexed multitude, and tells them that all has been
                  religiously and justly done, and that Satan's power shall this day receive its
                  death-blow in New England.</p>
               <p>Heaven grant it be so!—the great scholar must be right so lead the poor creatures
                  to their death! Do you see that group of children and half-grown girls, and, among
                  them, an old, hag-like Indian woman, Tituba by name? Those are the Afflicted Ones.
                  Behold, at this very instant, a proof of Satan's power and malice!<pb n="96-97"

                  smitten by a flash of Martha Carrier's eye, and falls down in the street, writhing
                  with horrible spasms and foaming at the mouth, like the possessed one spoken of in
                  Scripture. Hurry on the accursed witches to the gallows, ere they do more
                  mischief!—ere they fling out their withered arms, and scatter pestilence by
                  handfuls among the crowd!—ere, as their parting legacy, they cast a blight over
                  the land, so that henceforth it may bear no fruit nor blade of grass, and be fit
                  for nothing but a sepulchre for their unhallowed carcasses! So, on they go; and
                  old George Jacobs has stumbled, by reason of his infirmity; but Goodman Proctor
                  and his wife lean on one another, and walk at a reasonably steady pace,
                  considering their age. Mr. Burroughs seems to administer counsel to Martha
                  Carrier, whose face and mien, methinks, are milder and humbler than they were.
                  Among the multitude, meanwhile, there is horror, fear, and distrust; and friend
                  looks askance at friend, and the husband at his wife, and the wife at him, and
                  even the mother at her little child; as if, in every creature that God has made,
                  they suspected a witch, or dreaded an accuser. Never, never again, whether in this
                  or any other shape, may Universal Madness riot in the Main-street!</p>
               <p>I perceive in your eyes, my indulgent spectators, the criticism which you are too
                  kind to utter. These scenes, you think, are all too sombre. So, indeed, they are;
                  but the blame must rest on the sombre spirit of our forefathers, who wove their
                  web of life with hardly a single thread of rose-color or gold, and not on me, who
                  have a tropic-love of sunshine, and would gladly gild all the world with it, if I
                  knew where to find so much. That you may believe me, I will exhibit one of the
                  only class of scenes, so far as my investigation has taught me, in which our
                  ancestors were wont to steep their tough old hearts in wine and strong drink, and
                  indulge an outbreak of grisly jollity.</p>
               <p>Here it comes, out of the same house whence we saw brave Captain Gardner go forth
                  to the wars. What! A coffin, borne on men's shoulders, and six aged gentlemen as
                  pall-bearers, and a long train of mourners, with black gloves and black hat-bands,
                  and everything black, save a white handkerchief in each mourner's hand, to wipe
                  away his tears withal. Now, my kind patrons, you are angry with me. You were
                  bidden to a bridal-dance, and find yourselves walking in a funeral procession.
                  Even so; but look back through all the social customs of New England, in the first
                  century of her existence, and read all her traits of character; and if you find
                  one occasion, other than a funeral feast, where jollity was sanctioned by
                  universal practice, I will set fire to my puppet-show without another word. These
                  are the obsequies of old Governor Bradstreet, the patriarch and survivor of the
                  first settlers, who, having inter-married with the Widow Gardner, is now resting
                  from his labors, at the great age of ninety-four. The white-bearded corpse, which
                  was his spirit's earthly garniture, now lies beneath yonder coffin-lid. Many a
                  cask of ale and cider is on tap, and many a draught of spiced wine and aqua-vitæ
                  has been quaffed. Else why should the bearers stagger, as they tremulously uphold
                  the coffin?—and the aged pall-bearers, too, as they strive to walk solemnly beside
                  it?—and wherefore do the mourners tread on one another's heels?—and why, if we may
                     ask<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6669-00000048"/> without offence, should the nose
                  of the Reverend Mr. Noyes, through which he has just been delivering the funeral
                  discourse, glow like a ruddy coal of fire? Well, well, old friends! Pass on, with
                  your burthen of mortality, and lay it in the tomb with jolly hearts. People should
                  be permitted to enjoy themselves in their own fashion; every man to his taste; but
                  New England must have been a dismal abode for the man of pleasure, when the only
                  boon-companion was Death!</p>
               <p>Under cover of a mist that has settled over the scene, a few years flit by, and
                  escape our notice. As the atmosphere becomes transparent, we perceive a decrepit
                  grandsire, hobbling along the street. Do you recognize him? We saw him, first, as
                  the baby in Goodwife Massey's arms, when the primeval trees were flinging their
                  shadow over Roger Conant's cabin; we have seen him, as the boy, the youth, the
                  man, bearing his humble part in all the successive scenes, and forming the
                  index-figure whereby to note the age of his coëval town. And here he is, old
                  Goodman Massey, taking his last walk,—often pausing,—often leaning over his
                  staff,—and calling to mind whose dwelling stood at such and such a spot, and whose
                  field or garden occupied the site of those more recent houses. He can render a
                  reason for all the bends and deviations of the thoroughfare, which, in its
                  flexible and plastic infancy, was made to swerve aside from a straight line, in
                  order to visit every settler's door. The Main-street is still youthful; the coëval
                  man is in his latest age. Soon he will be gone, a patriarch of four-score, yet
                  shall retain a sort of infantine life in our local history, as the first town-born
                  child.</p>
               <p>Behold here a change, wrought in the twinkling of an eye, like an incident in a
                  tale of magic, even while your observation has been fixed upon the scene. The
                  Main-street has vanished out of sight. In its stead appears a wintry waste of
                  snow, with the sun just peeping over it, cold and bright, and tinging the white
                  expanse with the faintest and most ethereal rose-color. This is the Great Snow of
                  1717, famous for the mountain-drifts in which it buried the whole country. It
                  would seem as if the street, the growth of which we have noted so attentively,
                  following it from its first phase, as an Indian track, until it reached the
                  dignity of side-walks, were all at once obliterated, and resolved into a drearier
                  pathlessness than when the forest covered it. The gigantic swells and billows of
                  the snow have swept over each man's metes and bounds, and annihilated all the
                  visible distinctions of human property. So that now the traces of former times and
                  hitherto accomplished deeds being done away, mankind should be at liberty to enter
                  on new paths, and guide themselves by other laws than heretofore; if, indeed, the
                  race be not extinct, and it be worth our while to go on with the march of life,
                  over the cold and desolate expanse that lies before us. It may be, however, that
                  matters are not so desperate as they appear. That vast icicle, glittering so
                  cheerlessly in the sunshine, must be the spire of the meeting-house, incrusted
                  with frozen sleet. Those great heaps, too, which we mistook for drifts, are
                  houses, buried up to their eaves, and with their peaked roofs rounded by the depth
                  of snow upon them. There, now, comes a gush of smoke from what I judge to be the
                  chimney of the Ship Tavern;—and another—another—and another—from the chimneys of
                  other dwellings, where fireside comfort,<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6669-00000049"
                  /> domestic peace, the sports of children, and the quietude of age, are living
                  yet, in spite of the frozen crust above them.</p>
               <p>But it is time to change the scene. Its dreary monotony shall not test your
                  fortitude like one of our actual New England winters, which leaves so large a
                  blank—so melancholy a death-spot—in lives so brief that they ought to be all
                  summer-time. Here, at least, I may claim to be ruler of the seasons. One turn of
                  the crank shall melt away the snow from the Main-street, and show the trees in
                  their full foliage, the rose-bushes in bloom, and a border of green grass along
                  the side-walk. There! But what! How! The scene will not move. A wire is broken.
                  The street continues buried beneath the snow, and the fate of Herculaneum and
                  Pompeii has its parallel in this catastrophe.</p>
               <p>Alas! my kind and gentle audience, you know not the extent of your misfortune. The
                  scenes to come were far better than the past. The street itself would have been
                  more worthy of pictorial exhibition; the deeds of its inhabitants, not less so.
                  And how would your interest have deepened, as, passing out of the cold shadow of
                  antiquity, in my long and weary course, I should arrive within the limits of man's
                  memory, and, leading you at last into the sunshine of the present, should give a
                  reflex of the very life that is flitting past us! Your own beauty, my fair
                  townswomen, would have beamed upon you, out of my scene. Not a gentleman that
                  walks the street but should have beheld his own face and figure, his gait, the
                  peculiar swing of his arm, and the coat that he put on yesterday. Then, too,—and
                  it is what I chiefly regret,—I had expended a vast deal of light and brilliancy on
                  a representation of the street in its whole length, from Buffum's Corner downward,
                  on the night of the grand illumination for General Taylor's triumph. Lastly, I
                  should have given the crank one other turn, and have brought out the future,
                  showing you who shall walk the Main-street to-morrow, and, perchance, whose
                  funeral shall pass through it!</p>
               <p>But these, like most other human purposes, lie unaccomplished; and I have only
                  further to say, that any lady or gentleman who may feel dissatisfied with the
                  evening's entertainment shall receive back the admission fee at the door.</p>
               <p>"Then give me mine," cries the critic, stretching out his palm. "I said that your
                  exhibition would prove a humbug, and so it has turned out. So, hand over my
                  quarter!"</p>

               <head type="sub">A CHAPTER FROM AN ABORTIVE ROMANCE.</head>
               <p>BARTRAM the lime-burner, a rough, heavy-looking man, begrimed with charcoal, sat
                  watching his kiln, at nightfall, while his little son played at building houses
                  with the scattered fragments of marble, when, on the hill-side below them, they
                  heard a roar of laughter, not mirthful, but slow, and even solemn, like a wind
                  shaking the boughs of the forest.</p>
               <p>"Father, what is that?" asked the little boy, leaving his play, and pressing
                  betwixt his father's knees.</p>
               <p>"O, some drunken man, I suppose," answered the lime-burner; "some merry fellow
                  from the bar-room in the village, who dared not laugh loud enough within doors,
                  lest he should blow the roof of the house off. So here he is, shaking his jolly
                  sides at the foot of Graylock."</p>
               <p>"But, father," said the child, more sensitive than the obtuse, middle-aged clown,
                  "he does not laugh like a man that is glad. So the noise frightens me!"</p>
               <p>"Don't be a fool, child!" cried his father, gruffly. "You will never make a man, I
                  do believe; there is too much of your mother in you. I have known the rustling of
                  a leaf startle you. Hark! Here comes the merry fellow, now. You shall see that
                  there is no harm in him."</p>
               <p>Bartram and his little son, while they were talking thus, sat watching the same
                  lime-kiln that had been the scene of Ethan Brand's solitary and meditative life,
                  before he began his search for the Unpardonable Sin. Many years, as we have seen,
                  had now elapsed, since that portentous night when the IDEA was first developed.
                  The kiln, however, on the mountain-side, stood unimpaired, and was in nothing
                  changed since he had thrown his dark thoughts into the intense glow of its
                  furnace, and melted them, as it were, into the one thought that took possession of
                  his life. It was a rude, round, tower-like structure, about twenty-feet high,
                  heavily built of rough stones, and with a hillock of earth heaped about the larger
                  part of its circumference; so that the blocks and fragments of marble might be
                  drawn by cart-loads, and thrown in at the top. There was an opening at the bottom
                  of the tower, like an oven-mouth, but large enough to admit a man in a stooping
                  posture, and provided with a massive iron door. With the smoke and jets of flame
                  issuing from the chinks and crevices of this door, which seemed to give admittance
                  into the hill-side, it resembled nothing so much as the private entrance to the
                  infernal regions, which the shepherds of the Delectable Mountains were accustomed
                  to show to pilgrims.</p>
               <p>There are many such lime-kilns in that tract of country, for the purpose of
                  burning the white marble which composes a large part of the substance of the
                  hills. Some of them, built years ago, and long deserted, with weeds growing in the
                  vacant round of the interior, which is open to the sky, and grass and wild-flowers
                     rooting<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6669-00000051"/> themselves into the chinks
                  of the stones, look already like relics of antiquity, and may yet be overspread
                  with the lichens of centuries to come. Others, where the lime-burner still feeds
                  his daily and night-long fire, afford points of interest to the wanderer among the
                  hills, who seats himself on a log of wood or a fragment of marble, to hold a chat
                  with the solitary man. It is a lonesome, and, when the character is inclined to
                  thought, may be an intensely thoughtful occupation; as it proved in the case of
                  Ethan Brand, who had mused to such strange purpose, in days gone by, while the
                  fire in this very kiln was burning.</p>
               <p>The man who now watched the fire was of a different order, and troubled himself
                  with no thoughts save the very few that were requisite to his business. At
                  frequent intervals, he flung back the clashing weight of the iron door, and,
                  turning his face from the insufferable glare, thrust in huge logs of oak, or
                  stirred the immense brands with a long pole. Within the furnace were seen the
                  curling and riotous flames, and the burning marble, almost molten with the
                  intensity of heat; while without, the reflection of the fire quivered on the dark
                  intricacy of the surrounding forest, and showed in the foreground a bright and
                  ruddy little picture of the hut, the spring beside its door, the athletic and
                  coal-begrimed figure of the lime-burner, and the half-frightened child, shrinking
                  into the protection of his father's shadow. And when again the iron door was
                  closed, then reäppeared the tender light of the half-full moon, which vainly
                  strove to trace out the indistinct shapes of the neighboring mountains; and, in
                  the upper sky, there was a flitting congregation of clouds, still faintly tinged
                  with the rosy sunset, though thus far down into the valley the sunshine had
                  vanished long and long ago.</p>
               <p>The little boy now crept still closer to his father, as footsteps were heard
                  ascending the hill-side, and a human form thrust aside the bushes that clustered
                  beneath the trees.</p>
               <p>"Halloo! who is it?" cried the lime-burner, vexed at his son's timidity, yet half
                  infected by it. "Come forward, and show yourself, like a man, or I'll fling this
                  chunk of marble at your head!"</p>
               <p>"You offer me a rough welcome," said a gloomy voice, as the unknown man drew nigh.
                  "Yet I neither claim nor desire a kinder one, even at my own fireside."</p>
               <p>To obtain a distincter view, Bartram threw open the iron door of the kiln, whence
                  immediately issued a gush of fierce light, that smote full upon the stranger's
                  face and figure. To a careless eye there appeared nothing very remarkable in his
                  aspect, which was that of a man in a coarse, brown, country-made suit of clothes,
                  tall and thin, with the staff and heavy shoes of a wayfarer. As he advanced, he
                  fixed his eyes—which were very bright—intently upon the brightness of the furnace,
                  as if he beheld, or expected to behold, some object worthy of note within it.</p>
               <p>"Good-evening, stranger," said the lime-burner; "whence come you, so late in the
                  day?"</p>
               <p>"I come from my search," answered the wayfarer; "for, at last, it is
                  finished."</p>
               <p>"Drunk!—or crazy!" muttered Bartram to himself. "I shall have trouble with the
                  fellow. The sooner I drive him away, the better."</p>
               <p>The little boy, all in a tremble, whispered to his father,<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000052"/> and begged him to shut the door of the kiln, so
                  that there might not be so much light; for that there was something in the man's
                  face which he was afraid to look at, yet could not look away from. And, indeed,
                  even the lime-burner's dull and torpid sense began to be impressed by an
                  indescribable something in that thin, rugged, thoughtful visage, with the grizzled
                  hair hanging wildly about it, and those deeply-sunken eyes, which gleamed like
                  fires within the entrance of a mysterious cavern. But, as he closed the door, the
                  stranger turned towards him, and spoke in a quiet, familiar way, that made Bartram
                  feel as if he were a sane and sensible man, after all.</p>
               <p>"Your task draws to an end, I see," said he. "This marble has already been burning
                  three days. A few hours more will convert the stone to lime."</p>
               <p>"Why, who are you?" exclaimed the lime-burner. "You seem as well acquainted with
                  my business as I am myself."</p>
               <p>"And well I may be," said the stranger; "for I followed the same craft many a long
                  year, and here, too, on this very spot. But you are a new comer in these parts.
                  Did you never hear of Ethan Brand?"</p>
               <p>"The man that went in search of the Unpardonable Sin?" asked Bartram, with a
                  laugh.</p>
               <p>"The same," answered the stranger. "He has found what he sought, and therefore he
                  comes back again."</p>
               <p>"What! then you are Ethan Brand himself?" cried the lime-burner, in amazement. "I
                  am a new comer here, as you say, and they call <unclear>it</unclear> eighteen
                  years since you left the foot of Graylock. But, I can tell you, the good folks
                  still talk about Ethan Brand, in the village yonder, and what a strange errand
                  took him away from his lime-kiln. Well, and so you have found the Unpardonable
                  Sin?"</p>
               <p>"Even so!" said the stranger, calmly.</p>
               <p>"If the question is a fair one," proceeded Bartram, "where might it be?"</p>
               <p>Ethan Brand laid his finger on his own heart.</p>
               <p>"Here!" replied he.</p>
               <p>And then, without mirth in his countenance, but as if moved by an involuntary
                  recognition of the infinite absurdity of seeking throughout the world for what was
                  the closest of all things to himself, and looking into every heart, save his own,
                  for what was hidden in no other breast, he broke into a laugh of scorn. It was the
                  same slow, heavy laugh, that had almost appalled the lime-burner when it heralded
                  the wayfarer's approach.</p>
               <p>The solitary mountain-side was made dismal by it. Laughter, when out of place,
                  mistimed, or bursting forth from a disordered state of feeling, may be the most
                  terrible modulation of the human voice. The laughter of one asleep, even if it be
                  a little child,—the madman's laugh,—the wild, screaming laugh of a born idiot,—are
                  sounds that we sometimes tremble to hear, and would always willingly forget. Poets
                  have imagined no utterance of fiends or hobgoblins so fearfully appropriate as a
                  laugh. And even the obtuse lime-burner felt his nerves shaken, as this strange man
                  looked inward at his own heart, and burst into laughter that rolled away into the
                  night, and was indistinctly reverberated among the hills.</p>
               <p>"Joe," said he to his little son, "scamper down to the tavern in the village, and
                  tell the jolly fellows there that<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6669-00000053"/> Ethan
                  Brand has come back, and that he has found the Unpardonable Sin!"</p>
               <p>The boy darted away on his errand, to which Ethan Brand made no objection, nor
                  seemed hardly to notice it. He sat on a log of wood, looking steadfastly at the
                  iron door of the kiln. When the child was out of sight, and his swift and light
                  footsteps ceased to be heard treading first on the fallen leaves and then on the
                  rocky mountain-path, the lime-burner began to regret his departure. He felt that
                  the little fellow's presence had been a barrier between his guest and himself, and
                  that he must now deal, heart to heart, with a man who, on his own confession, had
                  committed the one only crime for which Heaven could afford no mercy. That crime,
                  in its indistinct blackness, seemed to overshadow him. The lime-burner's own sins
                  rose up within him, and made his memory riotous with a throng of evil shapes that
                  asserted their kindred with the Master Sin, whatever it might be, which it was
                  within the scope of man's corrupted nature to conceive and cherish. They were all
                  of one family; they went to and fro between his breast and Ethan Brand's, and
                  carried dark greetings from one to the other.</p>
               <p>Then Bartram remembered the stories which had grown traditionary in reference to
                  this strange man, who had come upon him like a shadow of the night, and was making
                  himself at home in his old place, after so long absence that the dead people, dead
                  and buried for years, would have had more right to be at home, in any familiar
                  spot, than he. Ethan Brand, it was said, had conversed with Satan himself in the
                  lurid blaze of this very kiln. The legend had been matter of mirth heretofore, but
                  looked grisly now. According to this tale, before Ethan Brand departed on his
                  search, he had been accustomed to evoke a fiend from the hot furnace of the
                  lime-kiln, night after night, in order to confer with him about the Unpardonable
                  Sin; the man and the fiend each laboring to frame the image of some mode of guilt
                  which could neither be atoned for nor forgiven. And, with the first gleam of light
                  upon the mountain-top, the fiend crept in at the iron door, there to abide the
                  intensest element of fire, until again summoned forth to share in the dreadful
                  task of extending man's possible guilt beyond the scope of Heaven's else infinite
                  mercy.</p>
               <p>While the lime-burner was struggling with the horror of these thoughts, Ethan
                  Brand rose from the log, and flung open the door of the kiln. The action was in
                  such accordance with the idea in Bartram's mind, that he almost expected to see
                  the Evil One issue forth, red-hot from the raging furnace.</p>
               <p>"Hold! hold!" cried he, with a tremulous attempt to laugh; for he was ashamed of
                  his fears, although they overmastered him. "Don't, for mercy's sake, bring out
                  your devil now!"</p>
               <p>"Man!" sternly replied Ethan Brand, "what need have I of the devil? I have left
                  him behind me, on my track. It is with such half-way sinners as you that he busies
                  himself. Fear not, because I open the door. I do but act by old custom, and am
                  going to trim your fire, like a lime-burner, as I was once."</p>
               <p>He stirred the vast coals, thrust in more wood, and bent forward to gaze into the
                  hollow prison-house of the fire, regardless of the fierce glow that reddened upon
                  his face. The lime-burner sat watching him, and half<pb n="110-111"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000054"/> suspected his strange guest of a purpose, if not to
                  evoke a fiend, at least to plunge bodily into the flames, and thus vanish from the
                  sight of man. Ethan Brand, however, drew quietly back, and closed the door of the
                  kiln.</p>
               <p>"I have looked," said he, "into many a human heart that was seven times hotter
                  with sinful passions than yonder furnace is with fire. But I found not there what
                  I sought. No, not the Unpardonable Sin!"</p>
               <p>"What is the Unpardonable Sin?" asked the lime-burner; and then he shrank further
                  from his companion, trembling lest his question should be answered.</p>
               <p>"It is a sin that grew within my own breast," replied Ethan Brand, standing erect,
                  with a pride that distinguishes all enthusiasts of his stamp. "A sin that grew
                  nowhere else! The sin of an intellect that triumphed over the sense of brotherhood
                  with man and reverence for God, and sacrificed everything to its own mighty
                  claims! The only sin that deserves a recompense of immortal agony! Freely, were it
                  to do again, would I incur the guilt. Unshrinkingly I accept the retribution!"</p>
               <p>"The man's head is turned," muttered the lime-burner to himself. "He may be a
                  sinner, like the rest of us,—nothing more likely,—but, I'll be sworn, he is a
                  madman too."</p>
               <p>Nevertheless he felt uncomfortable at his situation, alone with Ethan Brand on the
                  wild mountain-side, and was right glad to hear the rough murmur of tongues, and
                  the footsteps of what seemed a pretty numerous party, stumbling over the stones
                  and rustling through the underbrush. Soon appeared the whole lazy regiment that
                  was wont to infest the village tavern, comprehending three or four individuals who
                  had drunk flip beside the bar-room fire through all the winters, and smoked their
                  pipes beneath the stoop through all the summers, since Ethan Brand's departure.
                  Laughing boisterously, and mingling all their voices together in unceremonious
                  talk, they now burst into the moonshine and narrow streaks of fire-light that
                  illuminated the open space before the lime-kiln. Bartram set the door ajar again,
                  flooding the spot with light, that the whole company might get a fair view of
                  Ethan Brand, and he of them.</p>
               <p>There, among other old acquaintances, was a once ubiquitous man, now almost
                  extinct, but whom we were formerly sure to encounter at the hotel of every
                  thriving village throughout the country. It was the stage-agent. The present
                  specimen of the genus was a wilted and smoke-dried man, wrinkled and red-nosed, in
                  a smartly-cut, brown, bob-tailed coat, with brass buttons, who, for a length of
                  time unknown, had kept his desk and corner in the bar-room, and was still puffing
                  what seemed to be the same cigar that he had lighted twenty years before. He had
                  great fame as a dry joker, though, perhaps, less on account of any intrinsic humor
                  than from a certain flavor of brandy-toddy and tobacco-smoke, which impregnated
                  all his ideas and expressions, as well as his person. Another well-remembered
                  though strangely-altered face was that of Lawyer Giles, as people still called him
                  in courtesy; an elderly ragamuffin, in his soiled shirt-sleeves and tow-cloth
                  trousers. This poor fellow had been an attorney, in what he called his better
                  days, a sharp practitioner, and in great<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6669-00000055"
                  /> vogue among the village litigants; but flip, and sling, and toddy, and
                  cocktails, imbibed at all hours, morning, noon and night, had caused him to slide
                  from intellectual to various kinds and degrees of bodily labor, till, at last, to
                  adopt his own phrase, he slid into a soap-vat. In other words, Giles was now a
                  soap-boiler, in a small way. He had come to be but the fragment of a human being,
                  a part of one foot having been chopped off by an axe, and an entire hand torn away
                  by the devilish grip of a steam-engine. Yet, though the corporeal hand was gone, a
                  spiritual member remained; for, stretching forth the stump, Giles steadfastly
                  averred that he felt an invisible thumb and fingers with as vivid a sensation as
                  before the real ones were amputated. A maimed and miserable wretch he was; but
                  one, nevertheless, whom the world could not trample on, and had no right to scorn,
                  either in this or any previous stage of his misfortunes, since he had still kept
                  up the courage and spirit of a man, asked nothing in charity, and with his one
                  hand—and that the left one—fought a stern battle against want and hostile
                  circumstances.</p>
               <p>Among the throng, too, came another personage, who, with certain points of
                  similarity to Lawyer Giles, had many more of difference. It was the village
                  doctor; a man of some fifty years, whom, at an earlier period of his life, we
                  introduced as paying a professional visit to Ethan Brand during the latter's
                  supposed insanity. He was now a purple-visaged, rude, and brutal, yet
                  half-gentlemanly figure, with something wild, ruined, and desperate in his talk,
                  and in all the details of his gesture and manners. Brandy possessed this man like
                  an evil spirit, and made him as surly and savage as a wild beast, and as miserable
                  as a lost soul; but there was supposed to be in him such wonderful skill, such
                  native gifts of healing, beyond any which medical science could impart, that
                  society caught hold of him, and would not let him sink out of its reach. So,
                  swaying to and fro upon his horse, and grumbling thick accents at the bedside, he
                  visited all the sick chambers for miles about among the mountain towns, and
                  sometimes raised a dying man, as it were, by miracle, or quite as often, no doubt,
                  sent his patient to a grave that was dug many a year too soon. The doctor had an
                  everlasting pipe in his mouth, and, as somebody said, in allusion to his habit of
                  swearing, it was always alight with hell-fire.</p>
               <p>These three worthies pressed forward, and greeted Ethan Brand each after his own
                  fashion, earnestly inviting him to partake of the contents of a certain black
                  bottle, in which, as they averred, he would find something far better worth
                  seeking for than the Unpardonable Sin. No mind, which has wrought itself by
                  intense and solitary meditation into a high state of enthusiasm, can endure the
                  kind of contact with low and vulgar modes of thought and feeling to which Ethan
                  Brand was now subjected. It made him doubt—and, strange to say, it was a painful
                  doubt—whether he had indeed found the Unpardonable Sin, and found it within
                  himself. The whole question on which he had exhausted life, and more than life,
                  looked like a delusion.</p>
               <p>"Leave me," he said, bitterly, "ye brute beasts, that have made yourselves so,
                  shrivelling up your souls with fiery liquors! I have done with you. Years and
                     years<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6669-00000056"/> ago, I groped into your
                  hearts, and found nothing there for my purpose. Get ye gone!"</p>
               <p>"Why, you uncivil scoundrel," cried the fierce doctor, "is that the way you
                  respond to the kindness of your best friends? Then let me tell you the truth. You
                  have no more found the Unpardonable Sin than yonder boy Joe has. You are but a
                  crazy fellow,—I told you so twenty years ago,—neither better nor worse than a
                  crazy fellow, and the fit companion of old Humphrey, here!"</p>
               <p>He pointed to an old man, shabbily dressed, with long white hair, thin visage, and
                  unsteady eyes. For some years past this aged person had been wandering about among
                  the hills, inquiring of all travellers whom he met for his daughter. The girl, it
                  seemed, had gone off with a company of circus-performers; and occasionally tidings
                  of her came to the village, and fine stories were told of her glittering
                  appearance as she rode on horse-back in the ring, or performed marvellous feats on
                  the tight-rope.</p>
               <p>The white-haired father now approached Ethan Brand, and gazed unsteadily into his
                  face.</p>
               <p>"They tell me you have been all over the earth," said he, wringing his hands with
                  earnestness. "You must have seen my daughter, for she makes a grand figure in the
                  world, and everybody goes to see her. Did she send any word to her old father, or
                  say when she was coming back?"</p>
               <p>Ethan Brand's eye quailed beneath the old man's. That daughter, from whom he so
                  earnestly desired a word of greeting, was the Esther of our tale, the very girl
                  whom, with such cold and remorseless purpose, Ethan Brand had made the subject of
                  a psychological experiment, and wasted, absorbed, and perhaps annihilated her
                  soul, in the process.</p>
               <p>"Yes," murmured he, turning away from the hoary wanderer; "it is no delusion.
                  There is an Unpardonable Sin!"</p>
               <p>While these things were passing, a merry scene was going forward in the area of
                  cheerful light, beside the spring and before the door of the hut. A number of the
                  youth of the village, young men and girls, had hurried up the hill-side, impelled
                  by curiosity to see Ethan Brand, the hero of so many a legend familiar to their
                  childhood. Finding nothing, however, very remarkable in his aspect,—nothing but a
                  sun-burnt wayfarer, in plain garb and dusty shoes, who sat looking into the fire,
                  as if he fancied pictures among the coals,—these young people speedily grew tired
                  of observing him. As it happened, there was other amusement at hand. An old German
                  Jew, travelling with a diorama on his back, was passing down the mountain-road
                  towards the village just as the party turned aside from it, and, in hopes of eking
                  out the profits of the day, the showman had kept them company to the
                  lime-kiln.</p>
               <p>"Come, old Dutchman," cried one of the young men, "let us see your pictures, if
                  you can swear they are worth looking at!"</p>
               <p>"O, yes, Captain," answered the Jew,—whether as a matter of courtesy or craft, he
                  styled everybody Captain,—"I shall show you, indeed, some very superb
                  pictures!"</p>
               <p>So, placing his box in a proper position, he invited the young men and girls to
                  look through the glass orifices<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6669-00000057"/> of the
                  machine, and proceeded to exhibit a series of the most outrageous scratchings and
                  daubings, as specimens of the fine arts, that ever an itinerant showman had the
                  face to impose upon his circle of spectators. The pictures were worn out,
                  moreover, tattered, full of cracks and wrinkles, dingy with tobacco-smoke, and
                  otherwise in a most pitiable condition. Some purported to be cities, public
                  edifices, and ruined castles in Europe; others represented Napoleon's battles and
                  Nelson's sea-fights; and in the midst of these would be seen a gigantic, brown,
                  hairy hand,—which might have been mistaken for the Hand of Destiny, though, in
                  truth, it was only the showman's,—pointing its forefinger to various scenes of the
                  conflict, while its owner gave historical illustrations. When, with much merriment
                  at its abominable deficiency of merit, the exhibition was concluded, the German
                  bade little Joe put his head into the box. Viewed through the magnifying glasses,
                  the boy's round, rosy visage assumed the strangest imaginable aspect of an immense
                  Titanic child, the mouth grinning broadly, and the eyes and every other feature
                  overflowing with fun at the joke. Suddenly, however, that merry face turned pale,
                  and its expression changed to horror, for this easily impressed and excitable
                  child had become sensible that the eye of Ethan Brand was fixed upon him through
                  the glass.</p>
               <p>"You make the little man to be afraid, Captain," said the German Jew, turning up
                  the dark and strong outline of his visage, from his stooping posture. "But look
                  again, and, by chance, I shall cause you to see somewhat that is very fine, upon
                  my word!"</p>
               <p>Ethan Brand gazed into the box for an instant, and then starting back, looked
                  fixedly at the German. What had he seen? Nothing, apparently; for a curious youth,
                  who had peeped in almost at the same moment, beheld only a vacant space of
                  canvas.</p>
               <p>"I remember you now," muttered Ethan Brand to the showman.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Captain," whispered the Jew of Nuremburg, with a dark smile, "I find it to be
                  a heavy matter in my show-box,—this Unpardonable Sin! By my faith, Captain, it has
                  wearied my shoulders, this long day, to carry it over the mountain."</p>
               <p>"Peace," answered Ethan Brand, sternly, "or get thee into the furnace yonder!"</p>
               <p>The Jew's exhibition had scarcely concluded, when a great, elderly dog,—who seemed
                  to be his own master, as no person in the company laid claim to him,—saw fit to
                  render himself the object of public notice. Hitherto, he had shown himself a very
                  quiet, well-disposed old dog, going round from one to another, and, by way of
                  being sociable, offering his rough head to be patted by any kindly hand that would
                  take so much trouble. But now, all of a sudden, this grave and venerable
                  quadruped, of his own mere motion, and without the slightest suggestion from
                  anybody else, began to run round after his tail, which, to heighten the absurdity
                  of the proceeding, was a great deal shorter than it should have been. Never was
                  seen such headlong eagerness in pursuit of an object that could not possibly be
                  attained; never was heard such a tremendous outbreak of growling, snarling,
                  barking, and snapping,—as if one end of the ridiculous brute's body were at deadly
                  and most unforgivable enmity with the other. Faster and faster, round about<pb
                     n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6669-00000058"/> went the cur; and faster and still
                  faster fled the unapproachable brevity of his tail; and louder and fiercer grew
                  his yells of rage and animosity; until, utterly exhausted, and as far from the
                  goal as ever, the foolish old dog ceased his performance as suddenly as he had
                  begun it. The next moment he was as mild, quiet, sensible, and respectable in his
                  deportment, as when he first scraped acquaintance with the company.</p>
               <p>As may be supposed, the exhibition was greeted with universal laughter, clapping
                  of hands, and shouts of encore, to which the canine performer responded by wagging
                  all that there was to wag of his tail, but appeared totally unable to repeat his
                  very successful effort to amuse the spectators.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, Ethan Brand had resumed his seat upon the log, and moved, it might be,
                  by a perception of some remote analogy between his own case and that of this
                  self-pursuing cur, he broke into the awful laugh, which, more than any other
                  token, expressed the condition of his inward being. From that moment, the
                  merriment of the party was at an end; they stood aghast, dreading lest the
                  inauspicious sound should be reverberated around the horizon, and that mountain
                  would thunder it to mountain, and so the horror be prolonged upon their ears.
                  Then, whispering one to another that it was late,—that the moon was almost
                  down,—that the August night was growing chill,—they hurried homewards, leaving the
                  lime-burner and little Joe to deal as they might with their unwelcome guest. Save
                  for these three human beings, the open space on the hill-side was a solitude, set
                  in a vast gloom of forest. Beyond that darksome verge, the fire-light glimmered on
                  the stately trunks and almost black foliage of pines, intermixed with the lighter
                  verdure of sapling oaks, maples, and poplars, while here and there lay the
                  gigantic corpses of dead trees, decaying on the leaf-strewn soil. And it seemed to
                  little Joe—a timorous and imaginative child—that the silent forest was holding its
                  breath, until some fearful thing should happen.</p>
               <p>Ethan Brand thrust more wood into the fire, and closed the door of the kiln; then
                  looking over his shoulder at the lime-burner and his son, he bade, rather than
                  advised, them to retire to rest.</p>
               <p>"For myself, I cannot sleep," said he. "I have matters that it concerns me to
                  meditate upon. I will watch the fire, as I used to do in the old time."</p>
               <p>"And call the devil out of the furnace to keep you company, I suppose," muttered
                  Bartram, who had been making intimate acquaintance with the black bottle
                  above-mentioned. "But watch, if you like, and call as many devils as you like! For
                  my part, I shall be all the better for a snooze. Come, Joe!"</p>
               <p>As the boy followed his father into the hut, he looked back at the wayfarer, and
                  the tears came into his eyes, for his tender spirit had an intuition of the bleak
                  and terrible loneliness in which this man had enveloped himself.</p>
               <p>When they had gone, Ethan Brand sat listening to the crackling of the kindled
                  wood, and looking at the little spirts of fire that issued through the chinks of
                  the door. These trifles, however, once so familiar, had but the slightest hold of
                  his attention, while deep within his mind he was reviewing the gradual but
                  marvellous change that had been wrought upon him by the search to which<pb
                     n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6669-00000059"/> he had devoted himself. He remembered
                  how the night dew had fallen upon him,—how the dark forest had whispered to
                  him,—how the stars had gleamed upon him,—a simple and loving man, watching his
                  fire in the years gone by, and ever musing as it burned. He remembered with what
                  tenderness, with what love and sympathy for mankind, and what pity for human guilt
                  and woe, he had first begun to contemplate those ideas which afterwards became the
                  inspiration of his life; with what reverence he had then looked into the heart of
                  man, viewing it as a temple originally divine, and, however desecrated, still to
                  be held sacred by a brother; with what awful fear he had deprecated the success of
                  his pursuit, and prayed that the Unpardonable Sin might never be revealed to him.
                  Then ensued that vast intellectual development, which, in its progress, disturbed
                  the counterpoise between his mind and heart. The Idea that possessed his life had
                  operated as a means of education; it had gone on cultivating his powers to the
                  highest point of which they were susceptible; it had raised him from the level of
                  an unlettered laborer to stand on a star-lit eminence, whither the philosophers of
                  the earth, laden with the lore of universities, might vainly strive to clamber
                  after him. So much for the intellect! But where was the heart? That, indeed, had
                  withered—had contracted—had hardened—had perished! It had ceased to partake of the
                  universal throb. He had lost his hold of the magnetic chain of humanity. He was no
                  longer a brother-man, opening the chambers or the dungeons of our common nature by
                  the key of holy sympathy, which gave him a right to share in all its secrets; he
                  was now a cold observer, looking on mankind kind as the subject of his experiment,
                  and, at length, converting man and woman to be his puppets, and pulling the wires
                  that moved them to such degrees of crime as were demanded for his study.</p>
               <p>Thus Ethan Brand became a fiend. He began to be so from the moment that his moral
                  nature had ceased to keep the pace of improvement with his intellect. And now, as
                  his highest effort and inevitable development,—as the bright and gorgeous flower,
                  and rich, delicious fruit of his life's labor,—he had produced the Unpardonable
                  Sin!</p>
               <p>"What more have I to seek? What more to achieve?" said Ethan Brand to himself. "My
                  task is done, and well done!"</p>
               <p>Starting from the log with a certain alacrity in his gait, and ascending the
                  hillock of earth that was raised against the stone circumference of the lime-kiln,
                  he thus reached the top of the structure. It was a space of perhaps ten feet
                  across, from edge to edge, presenting a view of the upper surface of the immense
                  mass of broken marble with which the kiln was heaped. All these innumerable blocks
                  and fragments of marble were red-hot and vividly on fire, sending up great spouts
                  of blue flame, which quivered aloft and danced madly, as within a magic circle,
                  and sank and rose again, with continual and multitudinous activity. As the lonely
                  man bent forward over this terrible body of fire, the blasting heat smote up
                  against his person with a breath that, it might be supposed, would have scorched
                  and shrivelled him up in a moment.</p>
               <p>Ethan Brand stood erect, and raised his arms on high. The blue flames played upon
                  his face, and imparted the<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6669-00000060"/> wild and
                  ghastly light which alone could have suited its expression; it was that of a fiend
                  on the verge of plunging into his gulf of intensest torment.</p>
               <p>"O Mother Earth," cried he, "who art no more my Mother, and into whose bosom this
                  frame shall never be resolved! O mankind, whose brotherhood I have cast off, and
                  trampled thy great heart beneath my feet! O stars of heaven, that shone on me of
                  old, as if to light me onward and upward!—farewell all, and forever. Come, deadly
                  element of Fire,—henceforth my familiar friend! Embrace me, as I do thee!"</p>
               <p>That night the sound of a fearful peal of laughter rolled heavily through the
                  sleep of the lime-burner and his little son; dim shapes of horror and anguish
                  haunted their dreams, and seemed still present in the rude hovel, when they opened
                  their eyes to the daylight.</p>
               <p>"Up, boy, up!" cried the lime-burner, staring about him. "Thank Heaven, the night
                  is gone, at last; and rather than pass such another, I would watch my lime-kiln,
                  wide awake, for a twelvemonth. This Ethan Brand, with his humbug of an
                  Unpardonable Sin, has done me no such mighty favor, in taking my place!"</p>
               <p>He issued from the hut, followed by little Joe, who kept fast hold of his father's
                  hand. The early sunshine was already pouring its gold upon the mountain-tops; and
                  though the valleys were still in shadow, they smiled cheerfully in the promise of
                  the bright day that was hastening onward. The village, completely shut in by
                  hills, which swelled away gently about it, looked as if it had rested peacefully
                  in the hollow of the great hand of Providence. Every dwelling was distinctly
                  visible; the little spires of the two churches pointed upwards, and caught a
                  fore-glimmering of brightness from the sun-gilt skies upon their gilded
                  weather-cocks. The tavern was astir, and the figure of the old, smoke-dried
                  stage-agent, cigar in mouth, was seen beneath the stoop. Old Graylock was
                  glorified with a golden cloud upon his head. Scattered likewise over the breasts
                  of the surrounding mountains, there were heaps of hoary mist, in fantastic shapes,
                  some of them far down into the valley, others high up towards the summits, and
                  still others, of the same family of mist or cloud, hovering in the gold radiance
                  of the upper atmosphere. Stepping from one to another of the clouds that rested on
                  the hills, and thence to the loftier brotherhood that sailed in air, it seemed
                  almost as if a mortal man might thus ascend into the heavenly regions. Earth was
                  so mingled with sky that it was a day-dream to look at it.</p>
               <p>To supply that charm of the familiar and homely, which Nature so readily adopts
                  into a scene like this, the stage-coach was rattling down the mountain-road, and
                  the driver sounded his horn, while echo caught up the notes, and intertwined them
                  into a rich and varied and elaborate harmony, of which the original performer
                  could lay claim to little share. The great hills played a concert among
                  themselves, each contributing a strain of airy sweetness.</p>
               <p>Little Joe's face brightened at once.</p>
               <p>"Dear father," cried he, skipping cheerily to and fro, "that strange man is gone,
                  and the sky and the mountains all seem glad of it!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," growled the lime-burner, with an oath, "but he has let the fire go down,
                  and no thanks to him if five hundred bushels of lime are not spoiled. If I catch
                     the<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6669-00000061"/> fellow hereabouts again, I shall
                  feel like tossing him into the furnace!"</p>
               <p>With his long pole in his hand, he ascended to the top of the kiln. After a
                  moment's pause, he called to his son.</p>
               <p>"Come up here, Joe!" said he.</p>
               <p>So little Joe ran up the hillock, and stood by his father's side. The marble was
                  all burnt into perfect, snow-white lime. But on its surface, in the midst of the
                  circle,—snow-white too, and thoroughly converted into lime,—lay a human skeleton,
                  in the attitude of a person who, after long toil, lies down to long repose. Within
                  the ribs—strange to say—was the shape of a human heart.</p>
               <p>"Was the fellow's heart made of marble?" cried Bartram, in some perplexity at this
                  phenomenon. "At any rate, it is burnt into what looks like special good lime; and,
                  taking all the bones together, my kiln is half a bushel the richer for him."</p>
               <p>So saying, the rude lime-burner lifted his pole, and, letting it fall upon the
                  skeleton, the relics of Ethan Brand were crumbled into fragments.</p>

               <head>A BELL'S BIOGRAPHY.</head>
               <p>HEARKEN to our neighbor with the iron tongue! While I sit musing over my sheet of
                  foolscap, he emphatically tells the hour, in tones loud enough for all the town to
                  hear, though doubtless intended only as a gentle hint to myself, that I may begin
                  his biography before the evening shall be further wasted. Unquestionably, a
                  personage in such an elevated position, and making so great a noise in the world,
                  has a fair claim to the services of a biographer. He is the representative and
                  most illustrious member of that innumerable class, whose characteristic feature is
                  the tongue, and whose sole business, to clamor for the public good. If any of his
                  noisy brethren, in our tongue-governed democracy, be envious of the superiority
                  which I have assigned him, they have my free consent to hang themselves as high as
                  he. And, for his history, let not the reader apprehend an empty repetition of
                  ding-dong-bell. He has been the passive hero of wonderful vicissitudes, with which
                  I have chanced to become acquainted, possibly from his own mouth; while the
                  careless multitude supposed him to be talking merely of the time of day, or
                  calling them to dinner or to church, or bidding drowsy people go bedward, or the
                  dead to their graves. Many a revolution has it been his fate to go through, and
                     invariably<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6669-00000062"/> riably with a prodigious
                  uproar. And whether or no he have told me his reminiscences, this at least is
                  true, that the more I study his deep-toned language, the more sense, and
                  sentiment, and soul, do I discover in it.</p>
               <p>This bell—for we may as well drop our quaint personification—is of antique French
                  manufacture, and the symbol of the cross betokens that it was meant to be
                  suspended in the belfry of a Romish place of worship. The old people hereabout
                  have a tradition, that a considerable part of the metal was supplied by a brass
                  cannon, captured in one of the victories of Louis the Fourteenth over the
                  Spaniards, and that a Bourbon princess threw her golden crucifix into the molten
                  mass. It is said, likewise, that a bishop baptized and blessed the bell, and
                  prayed that a heavenly influence might mingle with its tones. When all due
                  ceremonies had been performed, the Grand Monarque bestowed the gift—than which
                  none could resound his beneficence more loudly—on the Jesuits, who were then
                  converting the American Indians to the spiritual dominion of the Pope. So the
                  bell,—our self-same bell, whose familiar voice we may hear at all hours, in the
                  streets,—this very bell sent forth its first-born accents from the tower of a
                  log-built chapel, westward of Lake Champlain, and near the mighty stream of the
                  Saint Lawrence. It was called Our Lady's Chapel of the Forest. The peal went forth
                  as if to redeem and consecrate the heathen wilderness. The wolf growled at the
                  sound, as he prowled stealthily through the underbrush; the grim bear turned his
                  back, and stalked sullenly away; the startled doe leaped up, and led her fawn into
                  a deeper solitude. The red men wondered what awful voice was speaking amid the
                  wind that roared through the tree-tops; and following reverentially its summons,
                  the dark-robed fathers blessed them, as they drew near the cross-crowned chapel.
                  In a little time, there was a crucifix on every dusky bosom. The Indians knelt
                  beneath the lowly roof, worshipping in the same forms that were observed under the
                  vast dome of Saint Peter's, when the Pope performed high mass in the presence of
                  kneeling princes. All the religious festivals, that awoke the chiming bells of
                  lofty cathedrals, called forth a peal from Our Lady's Chapel of the Forest. Loudly
                  rang the bell of the wilderness while the streets of Paris echoed with rejoicings
                  for the birth-day of the Bourbon, or whenever France had triumphed on some
                  European battle-field. And the solemn woods were saddened with a melancholy knell,
                  as often as the thick-strewn leaves were swept away from the virgin soil, for the
                  burial of an Indian chief.</p>
               <p>Meantime, the bells of a hostile people and a hostile faith were ringing on
                  Sabbaths and lecture-days, at Boston and other Puritan towns. Their echoes died
                  away hundreds of miles south-eastward of Our Lady's Chapel. But scouts had
                  threaded the pathless desert that lay between, and, from behind the huge
                  tree-trunks, perceived the Indians assembling at the summons of the bell. Some
                  bore flaxen-haired scalps at their girdles, as if to lay those bloody trophies on
                  Our Lady's altar. It was reported, and believed, all through New England, that the
                  Pope of Rome, and the King of France, had established this little chapel in the
                  forest, for the purpose of stirring up the red men to a crusade against the
                  English settlers. The latter took energetic measures to<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000063"/> secure their religion and their lives. On the eve
                  of an especial fast of the Romish church, while the bell tolled dismally, and the
                  priests were chanting a doleful stave, a band of New England rangers rushed from
                  the surrounding woods. Fierce shouts, and the report of musketry, pealed suddenly
                  within the chapel. The ministering priests threw themselves before the altar, and
                  were slain even on its steps. If, as antique traditions tell us, no grass will
                  grow where the blood of martyrs has been shed, there should be a barren spot, to
                  this very day, on the site of that desecrated altar.</p>
               <p>While the blood was still plashing from step to step, the leader of the rangers
                  seized a torch, and applied it to the drapery of the shrine. The flame and smoke
                  arose, as from a burnt-sacrifice, at once illuminating and obscuring the whole
                  interior of the chapel,—now hiding the dead priests in a sable shroud, now
                  revealing them and their slayers in one terrific glare. Some already wished that
                  the altar-smoke could cover the deed from the sight of Heaven. But one of the
                  rangers—a man of sanctified aspect, though his hands were bloody—approached the
                  captain.</p>
               <p>"Sir," said he, "our village meeting-house lacks a bell, and hitherto we have been
                  fain to summon the good people to worship by beat of drum. Give me, I pray you,
                  the bell of this popish chapel, for the sake of the godly Mr. Rogers, who
                  doubtless hath remembered us in the prayers of the congregation, ever since we
                  began our march. Who can tell what share of this night's good success we owe to
                  that holy man's wrestling with the Lord?"</p>
               <p>"Nay, then," answered the captain, "if good Mr. Rogers hath holpen our enterprise,
                  it is right that he should share the spoil. Take the bell and welcome, Deacon
                  Lawson, if you will be at the trouble of carrying it home. Hitherto it hath spoken
                  nothing but papistry, and that too in the French or Indian gibberish; but I
                  warrant me, if Mr. Rogers consecrate it anew, it will talk like a good English and
                  Protestant bell."</p>
               <p>So Deacon Lawson and half a score of his townsmen took down the bell, suspended it
                  on a pole, and bore it away on their sturdy shoulders, meaning to carry it to the
                  shore of Lake Champlain, and thence homeward by water. Far through the woods
                  gleamed the flames of Our Lady's Chapel, flinging fantastic shadows from the
                  clustered foliage, and glancing on brooks that had never caught the sunlight. As
                  the rangers traversed the midnight forest, staggering under their heavy burden,
                  the tongue of the bell gave many a tremendous stroke,—clang, clang, clang!—a most
                  doleful sound, as if it were tolling for the slaughter of the priests and the ruin
                  of the chapel. Little dreamed Deacon Lawson and his townsmen that it was their own
                  funeral knell. A war-party of Indians had heard the report of musketry, and seen
                  the blaze of the chapel, and now were on the track of the rangers, summoned to
                  vengeance by the bell's dismal murmurs. In the midst of a deep swamp, they made a
                  sudden onset on the retreating foe. Good Deacon Lawson battled stoutly, but had
                  his skull cloven by a tomahawk, and sank into the depths of the morass, with the
                  ponderous bell above him. And, for many a year thereafter, our hero's voice was
                  heard no more on earth, neither at the hour of worship, nor at festivals nor
                  funerals.</p>
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6669-00000064"/>
               <p>And is he still buried in that unknown grave? Scarcely so, dear reader. Hark! How
                  plainly we hear him at this moment, the spokesman of Time, proclaiming that it is
                  nine o'clock at night! We may therefore safely conclude that some happy chance has
                  restored him to upper air.</p>
               <p>But there lay the bell, for many silent years; and the wonder is, that he did not
                  lie silent there a century, or perhaps a dozen centuries, till the world should
                  have forgotten not only his voice, but the voices of the whole brotherhood of
                  bells. How would the first accent of his iron tongue have startled his
                  resurrectionists! But he was not fated to be a subject of discussion among the
                  antiquaries of far posterity. Near the close of the Old French War, a party of New
                  England axe-men, who preceded the march of Colonel Bradstreet toward Lake Ontario,
                  were building a bridge of logs through a swamp. Plunging down a stake, one of
                  these pioneers felt it graze against some hard, smooth substance. He called his
                  comrades, and, by their united efforts, the top of the bell was raised to the
                  surface, a rope made fast to it, and thence passed over the horizontal limb of a
                  tree. Heave-oh! up they hoisted their prize, dripping with moisture, and festooned
                  with verdant water-moss. As the base of the bell emerged from the swamp, the
                  pioneers perceived that a skeleton was clinging with its bony fingers to the
                  clapper, but immediately relaxing its nerveless grasp, sank back into the stagnant
                  water. The bell then gave forth a sullen clang. No wonder that he was in haste to
                  speak, after holding his tongue for such a length of time! The pioneers shoved the
                  bell to and fro, thus ringing a loud and heavy peal, which echoed widely through
                  the forest, and reached the ears of Colonel Bradstreet, and his three thousand
                  men. The soldiers paused on their march; a feeling of religion, mingled with
                  home-tenderness, overpowered their rude hearts; each seemed to hear the clangor of
                  the old church-bell, which had been familiar to him from infancy, and had tolled
                  at the funerals of all his forefathers. By what magic had that holy sound strayed
                  over the wide-murmuring ocean, and become audible amid the clash of arms, the loud
                  crashing of the artillery over the rough wilderness-path, and the melancholy roar
                  of the wind among the boughs?</p>
               <p>The New Englanders hid their prize in a shadowy nook, betwixt a large gray stone
                  and the earthy roots of an overthrown tree; and when the campaign was ended, they
                  conveyed our friend to Boston, and put him up at auction on the side-walk of
                  King-street. He was suspended, for the nonce, by a block and tackle, and being
                  swung backward and forward, gave such loud and clear testimony to his own merits,
                  that the auctioneer had no need to say a word. The highest bidder was a rich old
                  representative from our town, who piously bestowed the bell on the meeting-house
                  where he had been a worshipper for half a century. The good man had his reward. By
                  a strange coincidence, the very first duty of the sexton, after the bell had been
                  hoisted into the belfry, was to toll the funeral knell of the donor. Soon,
                  however, those doleful echoes were drowned by a triumphant peal for the surrender
                  of Quebec.</p>
               <p>Ever since that period, our hero has occupied the same elevated station, and has
                  put in his word on all matters of public importance, civil, military, or
                     religious.<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6669-00000065"/> On the day when
                  Independence was first proclaimed in the street beneath, he uttered a peal which
                  many deemed ominous and fearful, rather than triumphant. But he has told the same
                  story these sixty years, and none mistake his meaning now. When Washington, in the
                  fulness of his glory, rode through our flower-strewn streets, this was the tongue
                  that bade the Father of his Country welcome! Again the same voice was heard, when
                  La Fayette came to gather in his half-century's harvest of gratitude. Meantime,
                  vast changes have been going on below. His voice, which once floated over a little
                  provincial seaport, is now reverberated between brick edifices, and strikes the
                  ear amid the buzz and tumult of a city. On the Sabbaths of olden time, the summons
                  of the bell was obeyed by a picturesque and varied throng; stately gentlemen in
                  purple velvet coats, embroidered waistcoats, white wigs and gold-laced hats,
                  stepping with grave courtesy beside ladies in flowered satin gowns, and
                  hoop-petticoats of majestic circumference; while behind followed a liveried slave
                  or bondsman, bearing the psalm-book, and a stove for his mistress' feet. The
                  commonalty, clad in homely garb, gave precedence to their betters at the door of
                  the meeting-house, as if admitting that there were distinctions between them, even
                  in the sight of God. Yet, as their coffins were borne one after another through
                  the street, the bell has tolled a requiem for all alike. What mattered it, whether
                  or no there were a silver scutcheon on the coffin-lid? "Open thy bosom, Mother
                  Earth!" Thus spake the bell. "Another of thy children is coming to his long rest.
                  Take him to thy bosom, and let him slumber in peace." Thus spake the bell, and
                  Mother Earth received her child. With the self-same tones will the present
                  generation be ushered to the embraces of their mother; and Mother Earth will still
                  receive her children. Is not thy tongue a-weary, mournful talker of two centuries?
                  O, funeral bell! wilt thou never be shattered with thine own melancholy strokes?
                  Yea, and a trumpet-call shall arouse the sleepers, whom thy heavy clang could
                  awake no more!</p>
               <p>Again—again, thy voice, reminding me that I am wasting the "midnight oil." In my
                  lonely fantasy, I can scarce believe that other mortals have caught the sound, or
                  that it vibrates elsewhere than in my secret soul. But to many hast thou spoken.
                  Anxious men have heard thee on their sleepless pillows, and bethought themselves
                  anew of to-morrow's care. In a brief interval of wakefulness, the sons of toil
                  have heard thee, and say, "Is so much of our quiet slumber spent?—is the morning
                  so near at hand?" Crime has heard thee, and mutters, "Now is the very hour!"
                  Despair answers thee, "Thus much of this weary life is gone!" The young mother, on
                  her bed of pain and ecstasy, has counted thy echoing strokes, and dates from them
                  her first-born's share of life and immortality. The bridegroom and the bride have
                  listened, and feel that their night of rapture flits like a dream away. Thine
                  accents have fallen faintly on the ear of the dying man, and warned him that, ere
                  thou speakest again, his spirit shall have passed whither no voice of time can
                  ever reach. Alas for the departing traveller, if thy voice—the voice of fleeting
                  time—have taught him no lessons for Eternity!</p>

               <head>SYLPH ETHEREGE.</head>
               <p>ON a bright summer evening, two persons stood among the shrubbery of a garden,
                  stealthily watching a young girl, who sat in the window-seat of a neighboring
                  mansion. One of these unseen observers, a gentleman, was youthful, and had an air
                  of high breeding and refinement, and a face marked with intellect, though
                  otherwise of unprepossessing aspect. His features wore even an ominous, though
                  somewhat mirthful expression, while he pointed his long forefinger at the girl,
                  and seemed to regard her as a creature completely within the scope of his
                  influence.</p>
               <p>"The charm works!" said he, in a low, but emphatic whisper.</p>
               <p>"Do you know, Edward Hamilton,—since so you choose to be named,—do you know," said
                  the lady beside him, "that I have almost a mind to break the spell at once? What
                  if the lesson should prove too severe! True, if my ward could be thus laughed out
                  of her fantastic nonsense, she might be the better for it through life. But then,
                  she is such a delicate creature! And, besides, are you not ruining your own
                  chance, by putting forward this shadow of a rival?"</p>
               <p>"But will he not vanish into thin air, at my bidding?" rejoined Edward Hamilton.
                  "Let the charm work!"</p>
               <p>The girl's slender and sylph-like figure, tinged with radiance from the sunset
                  clouds, and overhung with the rich drapery of the silken curtains, and set within
                  the deep frame of the window, was a perfect picture; or, rather, it was like the
                  original loveliness in a painter's fancy, from which the most finished picture is
                  but an imperfect copy. Though her occupation excited so much interest in the two
                  spectators, she was merely gazing at a miniature which she held in her hand,
                  encased in white satin and red morocco; nor did there appear to be any other cause
                  for the smile of mockery and malice with which Hamilton regarded her.</p>
               <p>"The charm works!" muttered he, again. "Our pretty Sylvia's scorn will have a dear
                  retribution!"</p>
               <p>At this moment the girl raised her eyes, and, instead of a life-like semblance of
                  the miniature, beheld the ill-omened shape of Edward Hamilton, who now stepped
                  forth from his concealment in the shrubbery.</p>
               <p>Sylvia Etherege was an orphan girl, who had spent her life, till within a few
                  months past, under the guardianship, and in the secluded dwelling, of an old
                  bachelor uncle. While yet in her cradle, she had been the destined bride of a
                  cousin, who was no less passive in the betrothal than herself. Their future union
                  had been projected, as the means of uniting two rich estates, and was rendered
                  highly expedient, if not indispensable, by the testamentary dispositions of the
                  parents on both sides. Edgar Vaughan, the promised bridegroom, had been bred from
                  infancy in Europe, and had never seen the beautiful girl whose heart he was to
                  claim as his inheritance. But already, for several years, a correspondence had
                  been kept up between the cousins, and<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6669-00000067"/>
                  had produced an intellectual intimacy, though it could but imperfectly acquaint
                  them with each other's character.</p>
               <p>Sylvia was shy, sensitive, and fanciful; and her guardian's secluded habits had
                  shut her out from even so much of the world as is generally open to maidens of her
                  age. She had been left to seek associates and friends for herself in the haunts of
                  imagination, and to converse with them, sometimes in the language of dead poets,
                  oftener in the poetry of her own mind. The companion whom she chiefly summoned up
                  was the cousin with whose idea her earliest thoughts had been connected. She made
                  a vision of Edgar Vaughan, and tinted it with stronger hues than a mere
                  fancy-picture, yet graced it with so many bright and delicate perfections, that
                  her cousin could nowhere have encountered so dangerous a rival. To this shadow she
                  cherished a romantic fidelity. With its airy presence sitting by her side, or
                  gliding along her favorite paths, the loneliness of her young life was blissful;
                  her heart was satisfied with love, while yet its virgin purity was untainted by
                  the earthliness that the touch of a real lover would have left there. Edgar
                  Vaughan seemed to be conscious of her character; for, in his letters, he gave her
                  a name that was happily appropriate to the sensitiveness of her disposition, the
                  delicate peculiarity of her manners, and the ethereal beauty both of her mind and
                  person. Instead of Sylvia, he called her Sylph,—with the prerogative of a cousin
                  and a lover,—his dear Sylph Etherege.</p>
               <p>When Sylvia was seventeen, her guardian died, and she passed under the care of
                  Mrs. Grosvenor, a lady of wealth and fashion, and Sylvia's nearest relative,
                  though a distant one. While an inmate of Mrs. Grosvenor's family, she still
                  preserved somewhat of her life-long habits of seclusion, and shrank from a too
                  familiar intercourse with those around her. Still, too, she was faithful to her
                  cousin, or to the shadow which bore his name.</p>
               <p>The time now drew near when Edgar Vaughan, whose education had been completed by
                  an extensive range of travel, was to revisit the soil of his nativity. Edward
                  Hamilton, a young gentleman, who had been Vaughan's companion, both in his studies
                  and rambles, had already recrossed the Atlantic, bringing letters to Mrs.
                  Grosvenor and Sylvia Etherege. These credentials insured him an earnest welcome,
                  which, however, on Sylvia's part, was not followed by personal partiality, or even
                  the regard that seemed due to her cousin's most intimate friend. As she herself
                  could have assigned no cause for her repugnance, it might be termed instinctive.
                  Hamilton's person, it is true, was the reverse of attractive, especially when
                  beheld for the first time. Yet, in the eyes of the most fastidious judges, the
                  defect of natural grace was compensated by the polish of his manners, and by the
                  intellect which so often gleamed through his dark features. Mrs. Grosvenor, with
                  whom he immediately became a prodigious favorite, exerted herself to overcome
                  Sylvia's dislike. But, in this matter, her ward could neither be reasoned with nor
                  persuaded. The presence of Edward Hamilton was sure to render her cold, shy, and
                  distant, abstracting all the vivacity from her deportment, as if a cloud had come
                  betwixt her and the sunshine.</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6669-00000068"/>
               <p>The simplicity of Sylvia's demeanor rendered it easy for so keen an observer as
                  Hamilton to detect her feelings. Whenever any slight circumstance made him
                  sensible of them, a smile might be seen to flit over the young man's sallow
                  visage. None, that had once beheld this smile, were in any danger of forgetting
                  it; whenever they recalled to memory the features of Edward Hamilton, they were
                  always duskily illuminated by this expression of mockery and malice.</p>
               <p>In a few weeks after Hamilton's arrival, he presented to Sylvia Etherege a
                  miniature of her cousin, which, as he informed her, would have been delivered
                  sooner, but was detained with a portion of his baggage. This was the miniature in
                  the contemplation of which we beheld Sylvia so absorbed, at the commencement of
                  our story. Such, in truth, was too often the habit of the shy and musing girl. The
                  beauty of the pictured countenance was almost too perfect to represent a human
                  creature, that had been born of a fallen and world-worn race, and had lived to
                  manhood amid ordinary troubles and enjoyments, and must become wrinkled with age
                  and care. It seemed too bright for a thing formed of dust, and doomed to crumble
                  into dust again. Sylvia feared that such a being would be too refined and delicate
                  to love a simple girl like her. Yet, even while her spirit drooped with that
                  apprehension, the picture was but the masculine counterpart of Sylph Etherege's
                  sylph-like beauty. There was that resemblance between her own face and the
                  miniature which is said often to exist between lovers whom Heaven has destined for
                  each other, and which, in this instance, might be owing to the kindred blood of
                  the two parties. Sylvia felt, indeed, that there was something familiar in the
                  countenance, so like a friend did the eyes smile upon her, and seem to imply a
                  knowledge of her thoughts. She could account for this impression only by supposing
                  that, in some of her day-dreams, imagination had conjured up the true similitude
                  of her distant and unseen lover.</p>
               <p>But now could Sylvia give a brighter semblance of reality to those day-dreams.
                  Clasping the miniature to her heart, she could summon forth, from that haunted
                  cell of pure and blissful fantasies, the life-like shadow, to roam with her in the
                  moonlight garden. Even at noontide it sat with her in the arbor, when the sunshine
                  threw its broken flakes of gold into the clustering shade. The effect upon her
                  mind was hardly less powerful than if she had actually listened to, and
                  reciprocated, the vows of Edgar Vaughan; for, though the illusion never quite
                  deceived her, yet the remembrance was as distinct as of a remembered interview.
                  Those heavenly eyes gazed forever into her soul, which drank at them as at a
                  fountain, and was disquieted if reality threw a momentary cloud between. She heard
                  the melody of a voice breathing sentiments with which her own chimed in like
                  music. O, happy, yet hapless girl! Thus to create the being whom she loves, to
                  endow him with all the attributes that were most fascinating to her heart, and
                  then to flit with the airy creature into the realm of fantasy and moonlight, where
                  dwelt his dreamy kindred! For her lover wiled Sylvia away from earth, which seemed
                  strange, and dull, and darksome, and lured her to a country where her spirit
                  roamed in peaceful rapture, deeming that it had found its home.<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000069"/> Many, in their youth, have visited that land of
                  dreams, and wandered so long in its enchanted groves, that, when banished thence,
                  they feel like exiles everywhere.</p>
               <p>The dark-browed Edward Hamilton, like the villain of a tale, would often glide
                  through the romance wherein poor Sylvia walked. Sometimes, at the most blissful
                  moment of her ecstasy, when the features of the miniature were pictured brightest
                  in the air, they would suddenly change, and darken, and be transformed into his
                  visage. And always, when such change occurred, the intrusive visage wore that
                  peculiar smile with which Hamilton had glanced at Sylvia.</p>
               <p>Before the close of summer, it was told Sylvia Etherege that Vaughan had arrived
                  from France, and that she would meet him—would meet, for the first time, the loved
                  of years—that very evening. We will not tell how often and how earnestly she gazed
                  upon the miniature, thus endeavoring to prepare herself for the approaching
                  interview, lest the throbbing of her timorous heart should stifle the words of
                  welcome. While the twilight grew deeper and duskier, she sat with Mrs. Grosvenor
                  in an inner apartment, lighted only by the softened gleam from an alabaster lamp,
                  which was burning at a distance on the centre-table of the drawing-room. Never
                  before had Sylph Etherege looked so sylph-like. She had communed with a creature
                  of imagination, till her own loveliness seemed but the creation of a delicate and
                  dreamy fancy. Every vibration of her spirit was visible in her frame, as she
                  listened to the rattling of wheels and the tramp upon the pavement, and deemed
                  that even the breeze bore the sound of her lover's footsteps, as if he trode upon
                  the viewless air. Mrs. Grosvenor, too, while she watched the tremulous flow of
                  Sylvia's feelings, was deeply moved; she looked uneasily at the agitated girl, and
                  was about to speak, when the opening of the street door arrested the words upon
                  her lips.</p>
               <p>Footsteps ascended the staircase, with a confident and familiar tread, and some
                  one entered the drawing-room. From the sofa where they sat, in the inner
                  apartment, Mrs. Grosvenor and Sylvia could not discern the visiter.</p>
               <p>"Sylph!" cried a voice. "Dearest Sylph! Where are you, sweet Sylph Etherege? Here
                  is your Edgar Vaughan!"</p>
               <p>But instead of answering, or rising to meet her lover,—who had greeted her by the
                  sweet and fanciful name, which, appropriate as it was to her character, was known
                  only to him,—Sylvia grasped Mrs. Grosvenor's arm, while her whole frame shook with
                  the throbbing of her heart.</p>
               <p>"Who is it?" gasped she. "Who calls me Sylph?"</p>
               <p>Before Mrs. Grosvenor could reply, the stranger entered the room, bearing the lamp
                  in his hand. Approaching the sofa, he displayed to Sylvia the features of Edward
                  Hamilton, illuminated by that evil smile, from which his face derived so marked an
                  individuality.</p>
               <p>"Is not the miniature an admirable likeness?" inquired he.</p>
               <p>Sylvia shuddered, but had not power to turn away her white face from his gaze. The
                  miniature, which she had been holding in her hand, fell down upon the floor, where
                  Hamilton, or Vaughan, set his foot upon it, and crushed the ivory counterfeit to
                  fragments.</p>
               <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6669-00000070"/>
               <p>"There, my sweet Sylph!" he exclaimed. "It was I that created your phantom-lover,
                  and now I annihilate him! Your dream is rudely broken. Awake, Sylph Etherege,
                  awake to truth! I am the only Edgar Vaughan!"</p>
               <p>"We have gone too far, Edgar Vaughan," said Mrs. Grosvenor, catching Sylvia in her
                  arms. The revengeful freak, which Vaughan's wounded vanity had suggested, had been
                  countenanced by this lady, in the hope of curing Sylvia of her romantic notions,
                  and reconciling her to the truths and realities of life. "Look at the poor child!"
                  she continued. "I protest I tremble for the consequences!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, madam!" replied Vaughan, sneeringly, as he threw the light of the lamp on
                  Sylvia's closed eyes and marble features. "Well, my conscience is clear. I did but
                  look into this delicate creature's heart; and with the pure fantasies that I found
                  there, I made what seemed a man,—and the delusive shadow has wiled her away to
                  Shadow-land, and vanished there! It is no new tale. Many a sweet maid has shared
                  the lot of poor Sylph Etherege!"</p>
               <p>"And now, Edgar Vaughan," said Mrs. Grosvenor, as Sylvia's heart began faintly to
                  throb again, "now try, in good earnest, to win back her love from the phantom
                  which you conjured up. If you succeed, she will be the better, her whole life
                  long, for the lesson we have given her."</p>
               <p>Whether the result of the lesson corresponded with Mrs. Grosvenor's hopes, may be
                  gathered from the closing scene of our story. It had been made known to the
                  fashionable world that Edgar Vaughan had returned from France, and, under the
                  assumed name of Edward Hamilton, had won the affections of the lovely girl to whom
                  he had been affianced in his boyhood. The nuptials were to take place at an early
                  date. One evening, before the day of anticipated bliss arrived, Edgar Vaughan
                  entered Mrs. Grosvenor's drawing-room, where he found that lady and Sylph
                  Etherege.</p>
               <p>"Only that Sylvia makes no complaint," remarked Mrs. Grosvenor, "I should
                  apprehend that the town air is ill-suited to her constitution. She was always,
                  indeed, a delicate creature; but now she is a mere gossamer. Do but look at her!
                  Did you ever imagine anything so fragile?"</p>
               <p>Vaughan was already attentively observing his mistress, who sat in a shadowy and
                  moonlighted recess of the room, with her dreamy eyes fixed steadfastly upon his
                  own. The bough of a tree was waving before the window, and sometimes enveloped her
                  in the gloom of its shadow, into which she seemed to vanish.</p>
               <p>"Yes," he said, to Mrs. Grosvenor. "I can scarcely deem her 'of the earth,
                  earthy.' No wonder that I call her Sylph! Methinks she will fade into the
                  moonlight, which falls upon her through the window. Or, in the open air, she might
                  flit away upon the breeze, like a wreath of mist!"</p>
               <p>Sylvia's eyes grew yet brighter. She waved her hand to Edgar Vaughan, with a
                  gesture of ethereal triumph.</p>
               <p>"Farewell!" she said. "I will neither fade into the moonlight, nor flit away upon
                  the breeze. Yet you cannot keep me here!"</p>
               <p>There was something in Sylvia's look and tones that<pb n="144-145"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000071"/> startled Mrs. Grosvenor with a terrible
                  apprehension. But, as she was rushing towards the girl, Vaughan held her back.</p>
               <p>"Stay!" cried he, with a strange smile of mockery and anguish. "Can our sweet
                  Sylph be going to heaven, to seek the original of the miniature?"</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>THE CANTERBURY PILGRIMS.</head>
               <p>THE summer moon, which shines in so many a tale, was beaming over a broad extent
                  of uneven country. Some of its brightest rays were flung into a spring of water,
                  where no traveller, toiling, as the writer has, up the hilly road beside which it
                  gushes, ever failed to quench his thirst. The work of neat hands and considerate
                  art was visible about this blessed fountain. An open cistern, hewn and hollowed
                  out of solid stone, was placed above the waters, which filled it to the brim, but,
                  by some invisible outlet, were conveyed away without dripping down its sides.
                  Though the basin had not room for another drop, and the continual gush of water
                  made a tremor on the surface, there was a secret charm that forbade it to
                  overflow. I remember, that when I had slaked my summer thirst, and sat panting by
                  the cistern, it was my fanciful theory, that nature could not afford to lavish so
                  pure a liquid, as she does the waters of all meaner fountains.</p>
               <p>While the moon was hanging almost perpendicularly over this spot, two figures
                  appeared on the summit of the hill, and came with noiseless footsteps down towards
                  the spring. They were then in the first freshness of youth; nor is there a wrinkle
                  now on either of their brows, and yet they wore a strange, old-fashioned garb.
                  One, a young man with ruddy cheeks, walked beneath the<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000072"/> canopy of a broad-brimmed gray hat; he seemed to
                  have inherited his great-grandsire's square-skirted coat, and a waistcoat that
                  extended its immense flaps to his knees; his brown locks, also, hung down behind,
                  in a mode unknown to our times. By his side was a sweet young damsel, her fair
                  features sheltered by a prim little bonnet, within which appeared the vestal
                  muslin of a cap; her close, long-waisted gown, and indeed her whole attire, might
                  have been worn by some rustic beauty who had faded half a century before. But that
                  there was something too warm and life-like in them, I would here have compared
                  this couple to the ghosts of two young lovers, who had died long since in the glow
                  of passion, and now were straying out of their graves, to renew the old vows, and
                  shadow forth the unforgotten kiss of their earthly lips, beside the moonlit
                  spring.</p>
               <p>"Thee and I will rest here a moment, Miriam," said the young man, as they drew
                  near the stone cistern, "for there is no fear that the elders know what we have
                  done; and this may be the last time we shall ever taste this water."</p>
               <p>Thus speaking, with a little sadness in his face, which was also visible in that
                  of his companion, he made her sit down on a stone, and was about to place himself
                  very close to her side; she, however, repelled him, though not unkindly.</p>
               <p>"Nay, Josiah," said she, giving him a timid push with her maiden hand, "thee must
                  sit further off, on that other stone, with the spring between us. What would the
                  sisters say, if thee were to sit so close to me?"</p>
               <p>"But we are of the world's people now, Miriam," answered Josiah.</p>
               <p>The girl persisted in her prudery, nor did the youth, in fact, seem altogether
                  free from a similar sort of shyness; so they sat apart from each other, gazing up
                  the hill, where the moonlight discovered the tops of a group of buildings. While
                  their attention was thus occupied, a party of travellers, who had come wearily up
                  the long ascent, made a halt to refresh themselves at the spring. There were three
                  men, a woman, and a little girl and boy. Their attire was mean, covered with the
                  dust of the summer's day, and damp with the night-dew; they all looked woe-begone,
                  as if the cares and sorrows of the world had made their steps heavier as they
                  climbed the hill; even the two little children appeared older in evil days than
                  the young man and maiden who had first approached the spring.</p>
               <p>"Good-evening to you, young folks," was the salutation of the travellers; and
                  "Good-evening, friends," replied the youth and damsel.</p>
               <p>"Is that white building the Shaker meeting-house?" asked one of the strangers.
                  "And are those the red roofs of the Shaker village?"</p>
               <p>"Friend, it is the Shaker village," answered Josiah, after some hesitation.</p>
               <p>The travellers, who, from the first, had looked suspiciously at the garb of these
                  young people, now taxed them with an intention which all the circumstances,
                  indeed, rendered too obvious to be mistaken.</p>
               <p>"It is true, friends," replied the young man, summoning up his courage. "Miriam
                  and I have a gift to love each other, and we are going among the world's people,
                  to live after their fashion. And ye know that we do not<pb n="148-149"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000073"/> transgress the law of the land; and neither ye, nor
                  the elders themselves, have a right to hinder us."</p>
               <p>"Yet you think it expedient to depart without leave-taking," remarked one of the
                  travellers.</p>
               <p>"Yea, ye-a," said Josiah, reluctantly, "because father Job is a very awful man to
                  speak with; and being aged himself, he has but little charity for what he calls
                  the iniquities of the flesh."</p>
               <p>"Well," said the stranger, "we will neither use force to bring you back to the
                  village, nor will we betray you to the elders. But sit you here a while, and when
                  you have heard what we shall tell you of the world which we have left, and into
                  which you are going, perhaps you will turn back with us of your own accord. What
                  say you?" added he, turning to his companions. "We have travelled thus far without
                  becoming known to each other. Shall we tell our stories, here by this pleasant
                  spring, for our own pastime, and the benefit of these misguided young lovers?"</p>
               <p>In accordance with this proposal, the whole party stationed themselves round the
                  stone cistern; the two children, being very weary, fell asleep upon the damp
                  earth, and the pretty Shaker girl, whose feelings were those of a nun or a Turkish
                  lady, crept as close as possible to the female traveller, and as far as she well
                  could from the unknown men. The same person who had hitherto been the chief
                  spokesman now stood up, waving his hat in his hand, and suffered the moonlight to
                  fall full upon his front.</p>
               <p>"In me," said he, with a certain majesty of utterance, "in me, you behold a
                  poet."</p>
               <p>Though a lithographic print of this gentleman is extant, it may be well to notice
                  that he was now nearly forty, a thin and stooping figure, in a black coat, out at
                  elbows; notwithstanding the ill condition of his attire, there were about him
                  several tokens of a peculiar sort of foppery, unworthy of a mature man,
                  particularly in the arrangement of his hair, which was so disposed as to give all
                  possible loftiness and breadth to his forehead. However, he had an intelligent
                  eye, and, on the whole, a marked countenance.</p>
               <p>"A poet!" repeated the young Shaker, a little puzzled how to understand such a
                  designation, seldom heard in the utilitarian community where he had spent his
                  life. "O, ay, Miriam, he means a varse-maker, thee must know."</p>
               <p>This remark jarred upon the susceptible nerves of the poet; nor could he help
                  wondering what strange fatality had put into this young man's mouth an epithet,
                  which ill-natured people had affirmed to be more proper to his merit than the one
                  assumed by himself.</p>
               <p>"True, I am a verse-maker," he resumed, "but my verse is no more than the material
                  body into which I breathe the celestial soul of thought. Alas! how many a pang has
                  it cost me, this same insensibility to the ethereal essence of poetry, with which
                  you have here tortured me again, at the moment when I am to relinquish my
                  profession forever! O Fate! why hast thou warred with Nature, turning all her
                  higher and more perfect gifts to the ruin of me, their possessor? What is the
                  voice of song, when the world lacks the ear of taste? How can I rejoice in my
                  strength and delicacy of feeling, when they have but made great sorrows out of
                  little ones? Have I dreaded scorn like death,<pb n="150-151"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000074"/> and yearned for fame as others pant for vital air,
                  only to find myself in a middle state between obscurity and infamy? But I have my
                  revenge! I could have given existence to a thousand bright creations. I crush them
                  into my heart, and there let them putrefy! I shake off the dust of my feet against
                  my countrymen! But posterity, tracing my footsteps up this weary hill, will cry
                  shame upon the unworthy age that drove one of the fathers of American song to end
                  his days in a Shaker village!"</p>
               <p>During this harangue, the speaker gesticulated with great energy; and, as poetry
                  is the natural language of passion, there appeared reason to apprehend his final
                  explosion into an ode extempore. The reader must understand that, for all these
                  bitter words, he was a kind, gentle, harmless, poor fellow enough, whom Nature,
                  tossing her ingredients together without looking at her recipe, had sent into the
                  world with too much of one sort of brain, and hardly any of another.</p>
               <p>"Friend," said the young Shaker, in some perplexity, "thee seemest to have met
                  with great troubles; and, doubtless, I should pity them, if—if I could but
                  understand what they were."</p>
               <p>"Happy in your ignorance!" replied the poet, with an air of sublime superiority.
                  "To your coarser mind, perhaps, I may seem to speak of more important griefs, when
                  I add, what I had well-nigh forgotten, that I am out at elbows, and almost starved
                  to death. At any rate, you have the advice and example of one individual to warn
                  you back; for I am come hither, a disappointed man, flinging aside the fragments
                  of my hopes, and seeking shelter in the calm retreat which you are so anxious to
                  leave."</p>
               <p>"I thank thee, friend," rejoined the youth, "but I do not mean to be a poet, nor,
                  Heaven be praised! do I think Miriam ever made a varse in her life. So we need not
                  fear thy disappointments. But, Miriam," he added, with real concern, "thee knowest
                  that the elders admit nobody that has not a gift to be useful. Now, what under the
                  sun can they do with this poor varse-maker?"</p>
               <p>"Nay, Josiah, do not thee discourage the poor man," said the girl, in all
                  simplicity and kindness. "Our hymns are very rough, and perhaps they may trust him
                  to smooth them."</p>
               <p>Without noticing this hint of professional employment, the poet turned away, and
                  gave himself up to a sort of vague reverie, which he called thought. Sometimes he
                  watched the moon, pouring a silvery liquid on the clouds, through which it slowly
                  melted till they became all bright; then he saw the same sweet radiance dancing on
                  the leafy trees which rustled as if to shake it off, or sleeping on the high tops
                  of hills, or hovering down in distant valleys, like the material of unshaped
                  dreams; lastly, he looked into the spring, and there the light was mingling with
                  the water. In its crystal bosom, too, beholding all heaven reflected there, he
                  found an emblem of a pure and tranquil breast. He listened to that most ethereal
                  of all sounds, the song of crickets, coming in full choir upon the wind, and
                  fancied that, if moonlight could be heard, it would sound just like that. Finally,
                  he took a draught at the Shaker spring, and, as if it were the true Castalia, was
                  forthwith moved to compose a lyric, a Farewell to his Harp, which he swore<pb
                     n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6669-00000075"/> should be its closing strain, the last
                  verse that an ungrateful world should have from him. This effusion, with two or
                  three other little pieces, subsequently written, he took the first opportunity to
                  send, by one of the Shaker brethren, to Concord, where they were published in the
                  New Hampshire Patriot.</p>
               <p>Meantime, another of the Canterbury pilgrims, one so different from the poet that
                  the delicate fancy of the latter could hardly have conceived of him, began to
                  relate his sad experience. He was a small man, of quick and unquiet gestures,
                  about fifty years old, with a narrow forehead, all wrinkled and drawn together. He
                  held in his hand a pencil, and a card of some commission-merchant in foreign
                  parts, on the back of which, for there was light enough to read or write by, he
                  seemed ready to figure out a calculation.</p>
               <p>"Young man," said he, abruptly, "what quantity of land do the Shakers own here, in
                  Canterbury?"</p>
               <p>"That is more than I can tell thee, friend," answered Josiah, "but it is a very
                  rich establishment, and for a long way by the road-side thee may guess the land to
                  be ours, by the neatness of the fences."</p>
               <p>"And what may be the value of the whole," continued the stranger, "with all the
                  buildings and improvements, pretty nearly, in round numbers?"</p>
               <p>"O, a monstrous sum,—more than I can reckon," replied the young Shaker.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir," said the pilgrim, "there was a day, and not very long ago, neither,
                  when I stood at my counting-room window, and watched the signal flags of three of
                  my own ships entering the harbor, from the East Indies, from Liverpool, and from
                  up the Straits; and I would not have given the invoice of the least of them for
                  the title-deeds of this whole Shaker settlement. You stare. Perhaps, now, you
                  won't believe that I could have put more value on a little piece of paper, no
                  bigger than the palm of your hand, than all these solid acres of grain, grass and
                  pasture-land, would sell for?"</p>
               <p>"I won't dispute it, friend," answered Josiah, "but I know I had rather have fifty
                  acres of this good land than a whole sheet of thy paper."</p>
               <p>"You may say so now," said the ruined merchant, bitterly, "for my name would not
                  be worth the paper I should write it on. Of course, you must have heard of my
                  failure?"</p>
               <p>And the stranger mentioned his name, which, however mighty it might have been in
                  the commercial world, the young Shaker had never heard of among the Canterbury
                  hills.</p>
               <p>"Not heard of my failure!" exclaimed the merchant, considerably piqued. "Why, it
                  was spoken of on 'Change in London, and from Boston to New Orleans men trembled in
                  their shoes. At all events, I did fail, and you see me here on my road to the
                  Shaker village, where, doubtless (for the Shakers are a shrewd sect), they will
                  have a due respect for my experience, and give me the management of the trading
                  part of the concern, in which case, I think I can pledge myself to double their
                  capital in four or five years. Turn back with me, young man; for though you will
                  never meet with my good luck, you can hardly escape my bad."</p>
               <p>"I will not turn back for this," replied Josiah, calmly, "any more than for the
                  advice of the varse-maker, between whom and thee, friend, I see a sort of
                     likeness,<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6669-00000076"/> though I can't justly say
                  where it lies. But Miriam and I can earn our daily bread among the world's people,
                  as well as in the Shaker village. And do we want anything more, Miriam?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing more, Josiah," said the girl, quietly.</p>
               <p>"Yea, Miriam, and daily bread for some other little mouths, if God send them,"
                  observed the simple Shaker lad.</p>
               <p>Miriam did not reply, but looked down into the spring, where she encountered the
                  image of her own pretty face, blushing within the prim little bonnet. The third
                  pilgrim now took up the conversation. He was a sunburnt countryman, of tall frame
                  and bony strength, on whose rude and manly face there appeared a darker, more
                  sullen and obstinate despondency, than on those of either the poet or the
                  merchant.</p>
               <p>"Well, now, youngster," he began, "these folks have had their say, so I'll take my
                  turn. My story will cut but a poor figure by the side of theirs; for I never
                  supposed that I could have a right to meat and drink, and great praise besides,
                  only for tagging rhymes together, as it seems this man does; nor ever tried to get
                  the substance of hundreds into my own hands, like the trader there. When I was
                  about of your years, I married me a wife,—just such a neat and pretty young woman
                  as Miriam, if that's her name,—and all I asked of Providence was an ordinary
                  blessing on the sweat of my brow, so that we might be decent and comfortable, and
                  have daily bread for ourselves, and for some other little mouths that we soon had
                  to feed. We had no very great prospects before us; but I never wanted to be idle;
                  and I thought it a matter of course that the Lord would help me, because I was
                  willing to help myself."</p>
               <p>"And did n't he help thee, friend?" demanded Josiah, with some eagerness.</p>
               <p>"No," said the yeoman, sullenly; "for then you would not have seen me here. I have
                  labored hard for years; and my means have been growing narrower, and my living
                  poorer, and my heart colder and heavier, all the time; till at last I could bear
                  it no longer. I set myself down to calculate whether I had best go on the Oregon
                  expedition, or come here to the Shaker village; but I had not hope enough left in
                  me to begin the world over again; and, to make my story short, here I am. And now,
                  youngster, take my advice, and turn back; or else, some few years hence, you'll
                  have to climb this hill, with as heavy a heart as mine."</p>
               <p>This simple story had a strong effect on the young fugitives. The misfortunes of
                  the poet and merchant had won little sympathy from their plain good sense and
                  unworldly feelings, qualities which made them such unprejudiced and inflexible
                  judges, that few men would have chosen to take the opinion of this youth and
                  maiden as to the wisdom or folly of their pursuits. But here was one whose simple
                  wishes had resembled their own, and who, after efforts which almost gave him a
                  right to claim success from fate, had failed in accomplishing them.</p>
               <p>"But thy wife, friend?" exclaimed the young man, "What became of the pretty girl,
                  like Miriam? O, I am afraid she is dead!"</p>
               <p>"Yea, poor man, she must be dead,—she and the children, too," sobbed Miriam.</p>
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6669-00000077"/>
               <p>The female pilgrim had been leaning over the spring, wherein latterly a tear or
                  two might have been seen to fall, and form its little circle on the surface of the
                  water. She now looked up, disclosing features still comely, but which had acquired
                  an expression of fretfulness, in the same long course of evil fortune that had
                  thrown a sullen gloom over the temper of the unprosperous yeoman.</p>
               <p>"I am his wife," said she, a shade of irritability just perceptible in the sadness
                  of her tone. "These poor little things, asleep on the ground, are two of our
                  children. We had two more, but God has provided better for them than we could, by
                  taking them to himself."</p>
               <p>"And what would thee advise Josiah and me to do?" asked Miriam, this being the
                  first question which she had put to either of the strangers.</p>
               <p>"'T is a thing almost against nature for a woman to try to part true lovers,"
                  answered the yeoman's wife, after a pause; "but I'll speak as truly to you as if
                  these were my dying words. Though my husband told you some of our troubles, he did
                  n't mention the greatest, and that which makes all the rest so hard to bear. If
                  you and your sweetheart marry, you'll be kind and pleasant to each other for a
                  year or two, and while that's the case, you never will repent; but, by and by,
                  he'll grow gloomy, rough, and hard to please, and you'll be peevish, and full of
                  little angry fits, and apt to be complaining by the fireside, when he comes to
                  rest himself from his troubles out of doors; so your love will wear away by little
                  and little, and leave you miserable at last. It has Been so with us; and yet my
                  husband and I were true lovers once, if ever two young folks were."</p>
               <p>As she ceased, the yeoman and his wife exchanged a glance, in which there was more
                  and warmer affection than they had supposed to have escaped the frost of a wintry
                  fate, in either of their breasts. At that moment, when they stood on the utmost
                  verge of married life, one word fitly spoken, or perhaps one peculiar look, had
                  they had mutual confidence enough to reciprocate it, might have renewed all their
                  old feelings, and sent them back, resolved to sustain each other amid the
                  struggles of the world. But the crisis passed, and never came again. Just then,
                  also, the children, roused by their mother's voice, looked up, and added their
                  wailing accents to the testimony borne by all the Canterbury pilgrims against the
                  world from which they fled.</p>
               <p>"We are tired and hungry!" cried they. "Is it far to the Shaker village?"</p>
               <p>The Shaker youth and maiden looked mournfully into each other's eyes. They had but
                  stepped across the threshold of their homes, when lo! the dark array of cares and
                  sorrows that rose up to warn them back. The varied narratives of the strangers had
                  arranged themselves into a parable; they seemed not merely instances of woful fate
                  that had befallen others, but shadowy omens of disappointed hope, and unavailing
                  toil, domestic grief, and estranged affection, that would cloud the onward path of
                  these poor fugitives. But after one instant's hesitation, they opened their arms,
                  and sealed their resolve with as pure and fond an embrace as ever youthful love
                  had hallowed.</p>
               <p>"We will not go back," said they. "The world<pb n="158-159"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000078"/> never can be dark to us, for we will always love
                  one another."</p>
               <p>Then the Canterbury pilgrims went up the hill, while the poet chanted a drear and
                  desperate stanza of the Farewell to his Harp, fitting music for that melancholy
                  band. They sought a home where all former ties of nature or society would be
                  sundered, and all old distinctions levelled, and a cold and passionless security
                  be substituted for mortal hope and fear, as in that other refuge of the world's
                  weary outcasts, the grave. The lovers drank at the Shaker spring, and then, with
                  chastened hopes, but more confiding affections, went on to mingle in an untried
                  life.</p>

                  <p>HERE is a volume of what were once newspapers, each on a small half-sheet,
                     yellow and time-stained, of a coarse fabric, and imprinted with a rude old
                     type. Their aspect conveys a singular impression of antiquity, in a species of
                     literature which we are accustomed to consider as connected only with the
                     present moment. Ephemeral as they were intended and supposed to be, they have
                     long outlived the printer and his whole subscription-list, and have proved more
                     durable, as to their physical existence, than most of the timber, bricks, and
                     stone, of the town where they were issued. These are but the least of their
                     triumphs. The government, the interests, the opinions, in short, all the moral
                     circumstances that were contemporary with their publication, have passed away,
                     and left no better record of what they were than may be found in these frail
                     leaves. Happy are the editors of newspapers! Their productions excel all others
                     in immediate popularity, and are certain to acquire another sort of value with
                     the lapse of time. They scatter their leaves to the wind, as the sybil did, and
                     posterity collects them, to be treasured up among the best materials of its
                     wisdom. With hasty pens they write for immortality.</p>

                  <p>It is pleasant to take one of these little dingy half-sheets between the thumb
                     and finger, and picture forth the personage who, above ninety years ago, held
                     it, wet from the press, and steaming, before the fire. Many of the numbers bear
                     the name of an old colonial dignitary. There he sits, a major, a member of the
                     council, and a weighty merchant, in his high-backed arm-chair, wearing a solemn
                     wig and grave attire, such as befits his imposing gravity of mien, and
                     displaying but little finery, except a huge pair of silver shoe-buckles,
                     curiously carved. Observe the awful reverence of his visage, as he reads His
                     Majesty's most gracious speech; and the deliberate wisdom with which he ponders
                     over some paragraph of provincial politics, and the keener intelligence with
                     which he glances at the ship-news and commercial advertisements. Observe, and
                     smile! He may have been a wise man in his day; but, to us, the wisdom of the
                     politician appears like folly, because we can compare its prognostics with
                     actual results; and the old merchant seems to have busied himself about
                     vanities, because we know that the expected ships have been lost at sea, or
                     mouldered at the wharves; that his imported broadcloths were long ago worn to
                     tatters, and his cargoes of wine quaffed to the lees; and that the most
                     precious leaves of his ledger have become wastepaper. Yet, his avocations were
                     not so vain as our philosophic moralizing. In this world, we are the things of
                     a moment, and are made to pursue momentary things, with here and there a
                     thought that stretches mistily towards eternity, and perhaps may endure as
                     long. All philosophy that would abstract mankind from the present is no more
                     than words.</p>
                  <p>The first pages of most of these old papers are as soporific as a bed of
                     poppies. Here we have an erudite clergyman, or perhaps a Cambridge professor,
                     occupying several successive weeks with a criticism on Tate and Brady, as
                     compared with the New England version of the Psalms. Of course, the preference
                     is given to the native article. Here are doctors disagreeing about the
                     treatment of a putrid fever then prevalent, and black-guarding each other with
                     a characteristic virulence that renders the controversy not altogether
                     unreadable. Here are President Wigglesworth and the Rev. Dr. Colman,
                     endeavoring to raise a fund for the support of missionaries among the Indians
                     of Massachusetts Bay. Easy would be the duties of such a mission now! Here—for
                     there is nothing new under the sun—are frequent complaints of the disordered
                     state of the currency, and the project of a bank with a capital of five hundred
                     thousand pounds, secured on lands. Here are literary essays, from the
                     Gentleman's Magazine; and squibs against the Pretender, from the London
                     newspapers. And here, occasionally, are specimens of New England humor,
                     laboriously light and lamentably mirthful, as if some very sober person, in his
                     zeal to be merry, were dancing a jig to the tune of a funeral-psalm. All this
                     is wearisome, and we must turn the leaf.</p>
                  <p>There is a good deal of amusement, and some profit, in the perusal of those
                     little items which characterize the manners and circumstances of the country.
                     New England was then in a state incomparably more picturesque than at present,
                     or than it has been within the memory of man; there being, as yet, only a
                     narrow strip of civilization along the edge of a vast forest, peopled<pb
                        n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6669-00000080"/> pled with enough of its original
                     race to contrast the savage life with the old customs of another world. The
                     white population, also, was diversified by the influx of all sorts of
                     expatriated vagabonds, and by the continual importation of bond-servants from
                     Ireland and elsewhere, so that there was a wild and unsettled multitude,
                     forming a strong minority to the sober descendants of the Puritans. Then, there
                     were the slaves, contributing their dark shade to the picture of society. The
                     consequence of all this was a great variety and singularity of action and
                     incident, many instances of which might be selected from these columns, where
                     they are told with a simplicity and quaintness of style that bring the striking
                     points into very strong relief. It is natural to suppose, too, that these
                     circumstances affected the body of the people, and made their course of life
                     generally less regular than that of their descendants. There is no evidence
                     that the moral standard was higher then than now; or, indeed, that morality was
                     so well defined as it has since become. There seem to have been quite as many
                     frauds and robberies, in proportion to the number of honest deeds; there were
                     murders, in hot-blood and in malice; and bloody quarrels over liquor. Some of
                     our fathers also appear to have been yoked to unfaithful wives, if we may trust
                     the frequent notices of elopements from bed and board. The pillory, the
                     whipping-post, the prison, and the gallows, each had their use in those old
                     times; and, in short, as often as our imagination lives in the past, we find it
                     a ruder and rougher age than our own, with hardly any perceptible advantages,
                     and much that gave life a gloomier tinge.</p>
                  <p>In vain we endeavor to throw a sunny and joyous air over our picture of this
                     period; nothing passes before our fancy but a crowd of sad-visaged people,
                     moving duskily through a dull gray atmosphere. It is certain that winter rushed
                     upon them with fiercer storms than now, blocking up the narrow forest-paths,
                     and overwhelming the roads along the sea-coast with mountain snow-drifts; so
                     that weeks elapsed before the newspaper could announce how many travellers had
                     perished, or what wrecks had strewn the shore. The cold was more piercing then,
                     and lingered further into the spring, making the chimney-corner a comfortable
                     seat till long past May-day. By the number of such accidents on record, we
                     might suppose that the thunder-stone, as they termed it, fell oftener and
                     deadlier, on steeples, dwellings, and unsheltered wretches. In fine, our
                     fathers bore the brunt of more raging and pitiless elements than we. There were
                     forebodings, also, of a more fearful tempest than those of the elements. At two
                     or three dates, we have stories of drums, trumpets, and all sorts of martial
                     music, passing athwart the midnight sky, accompanied with the roar of cannon
                     and rattle of musketry, prophetic echoes of the sounds that were soon to shake
                     the land. Besides these airy prognostics, there were rumors of French fleets on
                     the coast, and of the march of French and Indians through the wilderness, along
                     the borders of the settlements. The country was saddened, moreover, with
                     grievous sickness. The small-pox raged in many of the towns, and seems, though
                     so familiar a scourge, to have been regarded with as much affright as that
                     which drove the throng from Wall-street and Broadway at the approach of a new
                     pestilence. There were autumnal fevers too, and a contagious and destructive<pb
                        n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6669-00000081"/> tive throat-distemper—diseases
                     unwritten in medical books. The dark superstition of former days had not yet
                     been so far dispelled as not to heighten the gloom of the present times. There
                     is an advertisement, indeed, by a committee of the Legislature, calling for
                     information as to the circumstances of sufferers in the "late calamity of
                     1692," with a view to reparation for their losses and misfortunes. But the
                     tenderness with which, after above forty years, it was thought expedient to
                     allude to the witchcraft delusion, indicates a good deal of lingering error, as
                     well as the advance of more enlightened opinions. The rigid hand of Puritanism
                     might yet be felt upon the reins of government, while some of the ordinances
                     intimate a disorderly spirit on the part of the people. The Suffolk justices,
                     after a preamble that great disturbances have been committed by persons
                     entering town and leaving it in coaches, chaises, calashes, and other
                     wheel-carriages, on the evening before the Sabbath, give notice that a watch
                     will hereafter be set at the "fortification-gate," to prevent these outrages.
                     It is amusing to see Boston assuming the aspect of a walled city, guarded,
                     probably, by a detachment of church-members, with a deacon at their head.
                     Governor Belcher makes proclamation against certain "loose and dissolute
                     people" who have been wont to stop passengers in the streets, on the Fifth of
                     November, "otherwise called Pope's Day," and levy contributions for the
                     building of bonfires. In this instance, the populace are more puritanic than
                     the magistrate.</p>
                  <p>The elaborate solemnities of funerals were in accordance with the sombre
                     character of the times. In cases of ordinary death, the printer seldom fails to
                     notice that the corpse was "very decently interred." But when some mightier
                     mortal has yielded to his fate, the decease of the "worshipful" such-a-one is
                     announced, with all his titles of deacon, justice, counsellor, and colonel;
                     then follows an heraldic sketch of his honorable ancestors, and lastly an
                     account of the black pomp of his funeral, and the liberal expenditure of
                     scarfs, gloves, and mourning-rings. The burial train glides slowly before us,
                     as we have seen it represented in the wood-cuts of that day, the coffin, and
                     the bearers, and the lamentable friends, trailing their long black garments,
                     while grim death, a most misshapen skeleton, with all kinds of doleful emblems,
                     stalks hideously in front. There was a coach-maker at this period, one John
                     Lucas, who seems to have gained the chief of his living by letting out a sable
                     coach to funerals.</p>
                  <p>It would not be fair, however, to leave quite so dismal an impression on the
                     reader's mind; nor should it be forgotten that happiness may walk soberly in
                     dark attire, as well as dance lightsomely in a gala-dress. And this reminds us
                     that there is an incidental notice of the "dancing-school near the
                     Orange-Tree," whence we may infer that the saltatory art was occasionally
                     practised, though perhaps chastened into a characteristic gravity of movement.
                     This pastime was probably confined to the aristocratic circle, of which the
                     royal governor was the centre. But we are scandalized at the attempt of
                     Jonathan Furness to introduce a more reprehensible amusement: he challenges the
                     whole country to match his black gelding in a race for a hundred pounds, to be
                     decided on Metonomy Common or Chelsea Beach. Nothing as to the manners of the
                     times can be<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6669-00000082"/> inferred from this
                     freak of an individual. There were no daily and continual opportunities of
                     being merry; but sometimes the people rejoiced, in their own peculiar fashion,
                     oftener with a calm, religious smile than with a broad laugh, as when they
                     feasted, like one great family, at Thanksgiving time, or indulged a livelier
                     mirth throughout the pleasant days of Election-week. This latter was the true
                     holiday-season of New England. Military musters were too seriously important in
                     that warlike time to be classed among amusements; but they stirred up and
                     enlivened the public mind, and were occasions of solemn festival to the
                     governor and great men of the province, at the expense of the field-officers.
                     The Revolution blotted a feast-day out of our calendar; for the anniversary of
                     the king's birth appears to have been celebrated with most imposing pomp, by
                     salutes from Castle William, a military parade, a grand dinner at the
                     town-house, and a brilliant illumination in the evening. There was nothing
                     forced nor feigned in these testimonials of loyalty to George the Second. So
                     long as they dreaded the reëstablishment of a popish dynasty, the people were
                     fervent for the house of Hanover: and, besides, the immediate magistracy of the
                     country was a barrier between the monarch and the occasional discontents of the
                     colonies; the waves of faction sometimes reached the governor's chair, but
                     never swelled against the throne. Thus, until oppression was felt to proceed
                     from the king's own hand, New England rejoiced with her whole heart on His
                     Majesty's birth-day.</p>
                  <p>But the slaves, we suspect, were the merriest part of the population, since it
                     was their gift to be merry in the worst of circumstances; and they endured,
                     comparatively, few hardships, under the domestic sway of our fathers. There
                     seems to have been a great trade in these human commodities. No advertisements
                     are more frequent than those of "a negro fellow, fit for almost any household
                     work;" "a negro woman, honest, healthy and capable;" "a young negro wench, of
                     many desirable qualities;" "a negro man, very fit for a taylor." We know not in
                     what this natural fitness for a tailor consisted, unless it were some
                     peculiarity of conformation that enabled him to sit cross-legged. When the
                     slaves of a family were inconveniently prolific,—it being not quite orthodox to
                     drown the superfluous offspring, like a litter of kittens,—notice was
                     promulgated of "a negro child to be given away." Sometimes the slaves assumed
                     the property of their own persons, and made their escape: among many such
                     instances, the governor raises a hue-and-cry after his negro Juba. But, without
                     venturing a word in extenuation of the general system, we confess our opinion
                     that Cæsar, Pompey, Scipio, and all such great Roman namesakes, would have been
                     better advised had they staid at home, foddering the cattle, cleaning
                     dishes,—in fine, performing their moderate share of the labors of life, without
                     being harassed by its cares. The sable inmates of the mansion were not excluded
                     from the' domestic affections: in families of middling rank, they had their
                     places at the board; and when the circle closed round the evening hearth, its
                     blaze glowed on their dark shining faces, intermixed familiarly with their
                     master's children. It must have contributed to reconcile them to their lot,
                     that they saw white men and women imported from Europe as they had been from
                        Africa,<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6669-00000083"/> and sold, though only for
                     a term of years, yet as actual slaves to the highest bidder. Slave labor being
                     but a small part of the industry of the country, it did not change the
                     character of the people; the latter, on the contrary, modified and softened the
                     institution, making it a patriarchal, and almost a beautiful, peculiarity of
                     the times.</p>
                  <p>Ah! We had forgotten the good old merchant, over whose shoulder we were
                     peeping, while he read the newspaper. Let us now suppose him putting on his
                     three-cornered gold-laced hat, grasping his cane, with a head inlaid of ebony
                     and mother-of-pearl, and setting forth, through the crooked streets of Boston,
                     on various errands, suggested by the advertisements of the day. Thus he
                     communes with himself: I must be mindful, says he, to call at Captain Scut's,
                     in Creek-lane, and examine his rich velvet, whether it be fit for my apparel on
                     Election-day,—that I may wear a stately aspect in presence of the governor and
                     my brethren of the council. I will look in, also, at the shop of Michael Cario,
                     the jeweller: he has silver buckles of a new fashion; and mine have lasted me
                     some half-score years. My fair daughter Miriam shall have an apron of gold
                     brocade, and a velvet mask,—though it would be a pity the wench should hide her
                     comely visage; and also a French cap, from Robert Jenkins', on the north side
                     of the town-house. He hath beads, too, and ear-rings, and necklaces, of all
                     sorts; these are but vanities—nevertheless, they would please the silly maiden
                     well. My dame desireth another female in the kitchen; wherefore, I must inspect
                     the lot of Irish lasses, for sale by Samuel Waldo, aboard the schooner
                     Endeavor; as also the likely negro wench, at Captain Bulfinch's. It were not
                     amiss that I took my daughter Miriam to see the royal waxwork, near the
                     town-dock, that she may learn to honor our most gracious King and Queen, and
                     their royal progeny, even in their waxen images; not that I would approve of
                     image-worship. The camel, too, that strange beast from Africa, with two great
                     humps, to be seen near the common; methinks I would fain go thither, and see
                     how the old patriarchs were wont to ride. I will tarry a while in Queen-street,
                     at the book-store of my good friends Kneeland &amp; Green, and purchase Doctor
                     Colman's new sermon, and the volume of discourses by Mr. Henry Flynt; and look
                     over the controversy on baptism, between the Reverend Peter Clarke and an
                     unknown adversary; and see whether this George Whitefield be as great in print
                     as he is famed to be in the pulpit. By that time, the auction will have
                     commenced at the Royal Exchange, in King-street. Moreover, I must look to the
                     disposal of my last cargo of West India rum and muscovado sugar; and also the
                     lot of choice Cheshire cheese, lest it grow mouldy. It were well that I ordered
                     a cask of good English beer, at the lower end of Milk-street. Then am I to
                     speak with certain dealers about the lot of stout old Vidonia, rich Canary, and
                     Oporto wines, which I have now lying in the cellar of the Old South
                     meeting-house. But, a pipe or two of the rich Canary shall be reserved, that it
                     may grow mellow in mine own wine-cellar, and gladden my heart when it begins to
                     droop with old age.</p>
                  <p>Provident old gentleman! But, was he mindful of his sepulchre? Did he bethink
                     him to call at the workshop of Timothy Sheaffe, in Cold-lane, and select
                        such<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6669-00000084"/> a grave-stone as would best
                     please him? There wrought the man whose handiwork, or that of his
                     fellow-craftsmen, was ultimately in demand by all the busy multitude who have
                     left a record of their earthly toil in these old time-stained papers. And now,
                     as we turn over the volume, we seem to be wandering among the mossy stones of a
                     burial-ground.</p>

                  <head>II. THE OLD FRENCH WAR.</head>
                  <p>AT a period about twenty years subsequent to that of our former sketch, we
                     again attempt a delineation of some of the characteristics of life and manners
                     in New England. Our text-book, as before, is a file of antique newspapers. The
                     volume which serves us for a writing-desk is a folio of larger dimensions than
                     the one before described; and the papers are generally printed on a whole
                     sheet, sometimes with a supplemental leaf of news and advertisements. They have
                     a venerable appearance, being overspread with the duskiness of more than
                     seventy years, and discolored, here and there, with the deeper stains of some
                     liquid, as if the contents of a wine-glass had long since been splashed upon
                     the page. Still, the old book conveys an impression that, when the separate
                     numbers were flying about town, in the first day or two of their respective
                     existences, they might have been fit reading for very stylish people. Such
                     newspapers could have been issued nowhere but in a metropolis the centre, not
                     only of public and private affairs, but of fashion and gayety. Without any
                     discredit to the colonial press, these might have been, and probably were,
                     spread out on the tables of the British coffee-house, in King-street, for the
                     perusal of the throng of officers who then drank their wine at that celebrated
                     establishment. To interest these military gentlemen, there were bulletins of
                     the war between Prussia and Austria; between England and France, on the old
                     battle-plains of Flanders; and between the same antagonists, in the newer
                     fields of the East Indies,—and in our own trackless woods, where white men
                     never trod until they came to fight there. Or, the travelled American, the
                     petit-maitre of the colonies,—the ape of London foppery, as the newspaper was
                     the semblance of the London foppery, as the newspaper was the semblance of the
                     London journals,—he, with his gray powdered periwig, his embroidered coat, lace
                     ruffles, and glossy silk stockings, golden-clocked,—his buckles, of glittering
                     paste, at knee-band and shoe-strap,—his scented handkerchief, and chapeau
                     beneath his arm,—even such a dainty figure need not have disdained to glance at
                     these old yellow pages, while they were the mirror of passing times. For his
                     amusement, there were essays of wit and humor, the light literature of the day,
                     which, for breadth and license, might have proceeded from the pen of Fielding
                     or Smollet; while, in other columns, he would delight his imagination with the
                     enumerated items of all sorts of finery, and with the rival advertisements of
                     half a dozen peruke-makers. In short, newer manners and customs had almost
                     entirely superseded those of the Puritans, even in their own city of
                     refuge.</p>
                  <p>It was natural that, with the lapse of time and increase of wealth and
                     population, the peculiarities of the early<pb n="172-173"
                        xml:id="VAC6669-00000085"/> settlers should have waxed fainter and fainter
                     through the generations of their descendants, who also had been alloyed by a
                     continual accession of emigrants from many countries and of all characters. It
                     tended to assimilate the colonial manners to those of the mother country, that
                     the commercial intercourse was great, and that the merchants often went thither
                     in their own ships. Indeed, almost every man of adequate fortune felt a
                     yearning desire, and even judged it a filial duty, at least once in his life,
                     to visit the home of his ancestors. They still called it their own home, as if
                     New England were to them, what many of the old Puritans had considered it, not
                     a permanent abiding-place, but merely a lodge in the wilderness, until the
                     trouble of the times should be passed. The example of the royal governors must
                     have had much influence on the manners of the colonists; for these rulers
                     assumed a degree of state and splendor which had never been practised by their
                     predecessors, who differed in nothing from republican chief-magistrates, under
                     the old charter. The officers of the crown, the public characters in the
                     interest of the administration, and the gentlemen of wealth and good descent,
                     generally noted for their loyalty, would constitute a dignified circle, with
                     the governor in the centre, bearing a very passable resemblance to a court.
                     Their ideas, their habits, their code of courtesy, and their dress, would have
                     all the fresh glitter of fashions immediately derived from the fountain-head,
                     in England. To prevent their modes of life from becoming the standard with all
                     who had the ability to imitate them, there was no longer an undue severity of
                     religion, nor as yet any disaffection to British supremacy, nor democratic
                     prejudices against pomp. Thus, while the colonies were attaining that strength
                     which was soon to render them an independent republic, it might have been
                     supposed that the wealthier classes were growing into an aristocracy, and
                     ripening for hereditary rank, while the poor were to be stationary in their
                     abasement, and the country, perhaps, to be a sister monarchy with England.
                     Such, doubtless, were the plausible conjectures deduced from the superficial
                     phenomena of our connection with a monarchical government, until the
                     prospective nobility were levelled with the mob, by the mere gathering of winds
                     that preceded the storm of the Revolution. The portents of that storm were not
                     yet visible in the air. A true picture of society, therefore, would have the
                     rich effect produced by distinctions of rank that seemed permanent, and by
                     appropriate habits of splendor on the part of the gentry.</p>
                  <p>The people at large had been somewhat changed in character, since the period of
                     our last sketch, by their great exploit, the conquest of Louisburg. After that
                     event, the New Englanders never settled into precisely the same quiet race
                     which all the world had imagined them to be. They had done a deed of history,
                     and were anxious to add new ones to the record. They had proved themselves
                     powerful enough to influence the result of a war, and were thenceforth called
                     upon, and willingly consented, to join their strength against the enemies of
                     England; on those fields, at least, where victory would redound to their
                     peculiar advantage. And now, in the heat of the Old French War, they might well
                     be termed a martial people. Every man was a soldier, or the father or brother
                     of a soldier; and the whole land literally echoed with the roll of the drum,
                     either beating<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6669-00000086"/> up for recruits among
                     the towns and villages, or striking the march towards the frontiers. Besides
                     the provincial troops, there were twenty-three British regiments in the
                     northern colonies. The country has never known a period of such excitement and
                     warlike life, except during the Revolution—perhaps scarcely then; for that was
                     a lingering war, and this a stirring and eventful one.</p>
                  <p>One would think that no very wonderful talent was requisite for an historical
                     novel, when the rough and hurried paragraphs of these newspapers can recall the
                     past so magically. We seem to be waiting in the street for the arrival of the
                     post-rider—who is seldom more than twelve hours beyond his time—with letters,
                     by way of Albany, from the various departments of the army. Or, we may fancy
                     ourselves in the circle of listeners, all with necks stretched out towards an
                     old gentleman in the centre, who deliberately puts on his spectacles, unfolds
                     the wet newspaper, and gives us the details of the broken and contradictory
                     reports, which have been flying from mouth to mouth, ever since the courier
                     alighted at Secretary Oliver's office. Sometimes we have an account of the
                     Indian skirmishes near Lake George, and how a ranging party of provincials were
                     so closely pursued, that they threw away their arms, and eke their shoes,
                     stockings, and breeches, barely reaching the camp in their shirts, which also
                     were terribly tattered by the bushes. Then, there is a journal of the siege of
                     Fort Niagara, so minute that it almost numbers the cannon-shot and bombs, and
                     describes the effect of the latter missiles on the French commandant's stone
                     mansion, within the fortress. In the letters of the provincial officers, it is
                     amusing to observe how some of them endeavor to catch the careless and jovial
                     turn of old campaigners. One gentleman tells us that he holds a brimming glass
                     in his hand, intending to drink the health of his correspondent, unless a
                     cannon-ball should dash the liquor from his lips; in the midst of his letter,
                     he hears the bells of the French churches ringing, in Quebec, and recollects
                     that it is Sunday; whereupon, like a good Protestant, he resolves to disturb
                     the Catholic worship by a few thirty-two pound shot. While this wicked man of
                     war was thus making a jest of religion, his pious mother had probably put up a
                     note, that very Sabbath-day, desiring the "prayers of the congregation for a
                     son gone a soldiering." We trust, however, that there were some stout old
                     worthies who were not ashamed to do as their fathers did, but went to prayer,
                     with their soldiers, before leading them to battle; and doubtless fought none
                     the worse for that. If we had enlisted in the Old French War, it should have
                     been under such a captain; for we love to see a man keep the characteristics of
                     his country.<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>

                     <p><ref target="#return_001">*</ref>The contemptuous jealousy of the British army, from the general
                        downwards, was very galling to the provincial troops. In one of the
                        newspapers, there is an admirable letter of a New England man, copied
                        from the London Chronicle, defending the provincials with an ability
                        worthy of Franklin, and somewhat in his style. The letter is remarkable,
                        also, because it takes up the cause of the whole range of colonies, as if
                        the writer looked upon them all as constituting one country, and that his
                        own. Colonial patriotism had not hitherto been so broad a sentiment.</p>
                  </note>
                  <p>These letters, and other intelligence from the army, are pleasant and lively
                     reading, and stir up the mind like the music of a drum and fife. It is less
                     agreeable to meet with accounts of women slain and scalped, and infants dashed
                     against trees, by the Indians on the frontiers<pb n="176-177"
                        xml:id="VAC6669-00000087"/> tiers. It is a striking circumstance, that
                     innumerable bears, driven from the woods, by the uproar of contending armies in
                     their accustomed haunts, broke into the settlements, and committed great
                     ravages among children, as well as sheep and swine. Some of them prowled where
                     bears had never been for a century, penetrating within a mile or two of Boston;
                     a fact that gives a strong and gloomy impression of something very terrific
                     going on in the forest, since these savage beasts fled townward to avoid it.
                     But it is impossible to moralize about such trifles, when every newspaper
                     contains tales of military enterprise, and often a huzza for victory; as, for
                     instance, the taking of Ticonderoga, long a place of awe to the provincials,
                     and one of the bloodiest spots in the present war. Nor is it unpleasant, among
                     whole pages of exultation, to find a note of sorrow for the fall of some brave
                     officer; it comes wailing in, like a funeral strain amidst a peal of triumph,
                     itself triumphant too. Such was the lamentation over Wolfe. Somewhere, in this
                     volume of newspapers, though we cannot now lay our finger upon the passage, we
                     recollect a report, that General Wolfe was slain, not by the enemy, but by a
                     shot from his own soldiers.</p>
                  <p>In the advertising columns, also, we are continually reminded that the country
                     was in a state of war. Governor Pownall makes proclamation for the enlisting of
                     soldiers, and directs the militia colonels to attend to the discipline of their
                     regiments, and the selectmen of every town to replenish their stocks of
                     ammunition. The magazine, by the way, was generally kept in the upper loft of
                     the village meeting-house. The provincial captains are drumming up for
                     soldiers, in every newspaper. Sir Jeffrey Amherst advertises for batteaux-men,
                     to be employed on the lakes; and gives notice to the officers of seven British
                     regiments, dispersed on the recruiting service, to rendezvous in Boston.
                     Captain Hallowell, of the province ship-of-war King George, invites able-bodied
                     seamen to serve his Majesty, for fifteen pounds, old tenor, per month. By the
                     rewards offered, there would appear to have been frequent desertions from the
                     New England forces; we applaud their wisdom, if not their valor or integrity.
                     Cannon of all calibres, gunpowder and balls, firelocks, pistols, swords, and
                     hangers, were common articles of merchandise. Daniel Jones, at the sign of the
                     hat and helmet, offers to supply officers with scarlet broadcloth, gold lace
                     for hats and waistcoats, cockades, and other military foppery, allowing credit
                     until the pay-rolls shall be made up. This advertisement gives us quite a
                     gorgeous idea of a provincial captain in full dress.</p>
                  <p>At the commencement of the campaign of 1759, the British general informs the
                     farmers of New England that a regular market will be established at Lake
                     George, whither they are invited to bring provisions and refreshments of all
                     sorts, for the use of the army. Hence, we may form a singular picture of petty
                     traffic, far away from any permanent settlements, among the hills which border
                     that romantic lake, with the solemn woods over-shadowing the scene. Carcasses
                     of bullocks and fat porkers are placed upright against the huge trunks of the
                     trees; fowls hang from the lower branches, bobbing against the heads of those
                     beneath; butter-firkins, great cheeses, and brown loaves of household bread,
                     baked in distant ovens, are collected under temporary shelters of<pb
                        n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6669-00000088"/> pine-boughs, with gingerbread, and
                     pumpkin-pies, perhaps, and other toothsome dainties. Barrels of cider and
                     spruce-beer are running freely into the wooden canteens of the soldiers.
                     Imagine such a scene, beneath the dark forest canopy, with here and there a few
                     struggling sunbeams, to dissipate the gloom. See the shrewd yeomen, haggling
                     with their scarlet-coated customers, abating somewhat in their prices, but
                     still dealing at monstrous profit; and then complete the picture with
                     circumstances that bespeak war and danger. A cannon shall be seen to belch its
                     smoke from among the trees, against some distant canoes on the lake; the
                     traffickers shall pause, and seem to hearken, at intervals, as if they heard
                     the rattle of musketry or the shout of Indians; a scouting-party shall be
                     driven in, with two or three faint and bloody men among them. And, in spite of
                     these disturbances, business goes on briskly in the market of the
                     wilderness.</p>
                  <p>It must not be supposed that the martial character of the times interrupted all
                     pursuits except those connected with war. On the contrary, there appears to
                     have been a general vigor and vivacity diffused into the whole round of
                     colonial life. During the winter of 1759, it was computed that about a thousand
                     sled-loads of country produce were daily brought into Boston market. It was a
                     symptom of an irregular and unquiet course of affairs, that innumerable
                     lotteries were projected, ostensibly for the purpose of public improvements,
                     such as roads and bridges. Many females seized the opportunity to engage in
                     business: as, among others, Alice Quick, who dealt in crockery and hosiery,
                     next door to Deacon Beautineau's; Mary Jackson, who sold butter, at the
                     Brazen-Head, in Cornhill; Abigail Hiller, who taught ornamental-work, near the
                     Orange-Tree, where also were to be seen the King and Queen, in wax-work; Sarah
                     Morehead, an instructor in glass-painting, drawing and japanning; Mary Salmon,
                     who shod horses, at the south-end; Harriet Pain, at the Buck and Glove, and
                     Mrs. Henrietta Maria Caine, at the Golden Fan, both fashionable milliners; Anna
                     Adams, who advertises Quebec and Garrick bonnets, Prussian cloaks, and scarlet
                     cardinals, opposite the old brick meeting-house; besides a lady at the head of
                     a wine and spirit establishment. Little did these good dames expect to reäppear
                     before the public, so long after they had made their last courtesies behind the
                     counter. Our great-grandmothers were a stirring sisterhood, and seem not to
                     have been utterly despised by the gentlemen at the British coffee-house; at
                     least, some gracious bachelor, there resident, gives public notice of his
                     willingness to take a wife, provided she be not above twenty-three, and possess
                     brown hair, regular features, a brisk eye, and a fortune. Now, this was great
                     condescension towards the ladies of Massachusetts Bay, in a threadbare
                     lieutenant of foot.</p>
                  <p>Polite literature was beginning to make its appearance. Few native works were
                     advertised, it is true, except sermons and treatises of controversial divinity;
                     nor were the English authors of the day much known on this side of the
                     Atlantic. But catalogues were frequently offered at auction or private sale,
                     comprising the standard English books, history, essays, and poetry, of Queen
                     Anne's age, and the preceding century. We see nothing in the nature of a novel,
                     unless it be "The Two Mothers, price four coppers." There was an American<pb
                        n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6669-00000089"/> poet, however, of whom Mr. Kettell
                     has preserved no specimen,—the author of "War, an Heroic Poem;" he publishes by
                     subscription, and threatens to prosecute his patrons for not taking their
                     books. We have discovered a periodical, also, and one that has a peculiar claim
                     to be recorded here, since it bore the title of "THE NEW ENGLAND MAGAZINE," a
                     forgotten predecessor, for which we should have a filial respect, and take its
                     excellence on trust. The fine arts, too, were budding into existence. At the
                     "old glass and picture shop," in Cornhill, various maps, plates, and views, are
                     advertised, and among them a "Prospect of Boston," a copper-plate engraving of
                     Quebec, and the effigies of all the New England ministers ever done in
                     mezzotinto. All these must have been very salable articles. Other ornamental
                     wares were to be found at the same shop; such as violins, flutes, hautboys,
                     musical books, English and Dutch toys, and London babies. About this period,
                     Mr. Dipper gives notice of a concert of vocal and instrumental music. There had
                     already been an attempt at theatrical exhibitions.</p>
                  <p>There are tokens, in every newspaper, of a style of luxury and magnificence
                     which we do not usually associate with our ideas of the times. When the
                     property of a deceased person was to be sold, we find, among the household
                     furniture, silk beds and hangings, damask table-cloths, Turkey carpets,
                     pictures, pier-glasses, massive plate, and all things proper for a noble
                     mansion. Wine was more generally drunk than now, though by no means to the
                     neglect of ardent spirits. For the apparel of both sexes, the mercers and
                     milliners imported good store of fine broadcloths, especially scarlet, crimson,
                     and sky-blue, silks, satins, lawns, and velvets, gold brocade, and gold and
                     silver lace, and silver tassels, and silver spangles, until Cornhill shone and
                     sparkled with their merchandise. The gaudiest dress permissible by modern taste
                     fades into a Quaker-like sobriety, compared with the deep, rich, glowing
                     splendor of our ancestors. Such figures were almost too fine to go about town
                     on foot; accordingly, carriages were so numerous as to require a tax; and it is
                     recorded that, when Governor Bernard came to the province, he was met, between
                     Dedham and Boston, by a multitude of gentlemen in their coaches and
                     chariots.</p>
                  <p>Take my arm, gentle reader, and come with me into some street, perhaps trodden
                     by your daily footsteps, but which now has such an aspect of half-familiar
                     strangeness, that you suspect yourself to be walking abroad in a dream. True,
                     there are some brick edifices which you remember from childhood, and which your
                     father and grandfather remembered as well; but you are perplexed by the absence
                     of many that were here only an hour or two since; and still more amazing is the
                     presence of whole rows of wooden and plastered houses, projecting over the
                     side-walks, and bearing iron figures on their fronts, which prove them to have
                     stood on the same sites above a century. Where have your eyes been, that you
                     never saw them before? Along the ghostly street—for, at length, you conclude
                     that all is unsubstantial, though it be so good a mockery of an antique
                     town—along the ghostly street, there are ghostly people too. Every gentleman
                     has his three-cornered hat, either on his head or under his arm; and all wear
                     wigs, in infinite variety,—the Tie, the Brigadier, the Spencer, the Albemarle,
                        the<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6669-00000090"/> Major, the Ramillies, the
                     grave Full-bottom, or the giddy Feather-top. Look at the elaborate
                     lace-ruffles, and the square-skirted coats of gorgeous hues, bedizened with
                     silver and gold! Make way for the phantom-ladies, whose hoops require such
                     breadth of passage, as they pace majestically along, in silken gowns, blue,
                     green, or yellow, brilliantly embroidered, and with small satin hats
                     surmounting their powdered hair. Make way; for the whole spectral show will
                     vanish, if your earthly garments brush against their robes. Now that the scene
                     is brightest, and the whole street glitters with imaginary sunshine,—now hark
                     to the bells of the Old South and the Old North, ringing out with a sudden and
                     merry peal, while the cannon of Castle William thunder below the town, and
                     those of the Diana frigate repeat the sound, and the Charlestown batteries
                     reply with a nearer roar! You see the crowd toss up their hats, in visionary
                     joy. You hear of illuminations and fire-works, and of bonfires, built on
                     scaffolds, raised several stories above the ground, that are to blaze all
                     night, in King-street, and on Beacon-hill. And here come the trumpets and
                     kettle-drums, and the tramping hoofs of the Boston troop of horse-guards,
                     escorting the governor to King's Chapel, where he is to return solemn thanks
                     for the surrender of Quebec. March on, thou shadowy troop! and vanish, ghostly
                     crowd! and change again, old street! for those stirring times are gone.</p>
                  <p>Opportunely for the conclusion of our sketch, a fire broke out, on the
                     twentieth of March, 1760, at the Brazen-Head, in Cornhill, and consumed nearly
                     four hundred buildings. Similar disasters have always been epochs in the
                     chronology of Boston. That of 1711 had hitherto been termed the Great Fire, but
                     now resigned its baleful dignity to one which has ever since retained it. Did
                     we desire to move the reader's sympathies on this subject, we would not be
                     grandiloquent about the sea of billowy flame, the glowing and crumbling
                     streets, the broad, black firmament of smoke, and the blast of wind that sprang
                     up with the conflagration and roared behind it. It would be more effective to
                     mark out a single family, at the moment when the flames caught upon an angle of
                     their dwelling: then would ensue the removal of the bed-ridden grandmother, the
                     cradle with the sleeping infant, and, most dismal of all, the dying man just at
                     the extremity of a lingering disease. Do but imagine the confused agony of one
                     thus awfully disturbed in his last hour; his fearful glance behind at the
                     consuming fire, raging after him, from house to house, as its devoted victim;
                     and, finally, the almost eagerness with which he would seize some calmer
                     interval to die! The Great Fire must have realized many such a scene.</p>
                  <p>Doubtless posterity has acquired a better city by the calamity of that
                     generation. None will be inclined to lament it at this late day, except the
                     lover of antiquity, who would have been glad to walk among those streets of
                     venerable houses, fancying the old inhabitants still there, that he might
                     commune with their shadows, and paint a more vivid picture of their times.</p>

                  <head>III. THE OLD TORY.</head>
                  <p>AGAIN we take a leap of about twenty years, and alight in the midst of the
                     Revolution. Indeed, having just closed a volume of colonial newspapers, which
                     represented the period when monarchical and aristocratic sentiments were at the
                     highest,—and now opening another volume printed in the same metropolis, after
                     such sentiments had long been deemed a sin and shame,—we feel as if the leap
                     were more than figurative. Our late course of reading has tinctured us, for the
                     moment, with antique prejudices; and we shrink from the strangely-contrasted
                     times into which we emerge, like one of those immutable old Tories, who
                     acknowledge no oppression in the Stamp-act. It may be the most effective method
                     of going through the present file of papers, to follow out this idea, and
                     transform ourself, perchance, from a modern Tory, into such a sturdy King-man
                     as once wore that pliable nickname.</p>
                  <p>Well, then, here we sit, an old, gray, withered, sour-visaged, threadbare sort
                     of gentleman, erect enough, here in our solitude, but marked out by a depressed
                     and distrustful mien abroad, as one conscious of a stigma upon his forehead,
                     though for no crime. We were already in the decline of life when the first
                     tremors of the earthquake that has convulsed the continent were felt. Our mind
                     had grown too rigid to change any of its opinions, when the voice of the people
                     demanded that all should be changed. We are an Episcopalian, and sat under the
                     high-church doctrines of Doctor Caner; we have been a captain of the provincial
                     forces, and love our king the better for the blood that we shed in his cause on
                     the Plains of Abraham. Among all the refugees, there is not one more loyal to
                     the back-bone than we. Still we lingered behind when the British army evacuated
                     Boston, sweeping in its train most of those with whom we held communion; the
                     old, loyal gentlemen, the aristocracy of the colonies, the hereditary
                     Englishman, imbued with more than native zeal and admiration for the glorious
                     island and its monarch, because the far intervening ocean threw a dim reverence
                     around them. When our brethren departed, we could not tear our aged roots out
                     of the soil. We have remained, therefore, enduring to be outwardly a freeman,
                     but idolizing King George in secrecy and silence,—one true old heart amongst a
                     host of enemies. We watch, with a weary hope, for the moment when all this
                     turmoil shall subside, and the impious novelty that has distracted our latter
                     years, like a wild dream, give place to the blessed quietude of royal sway,
                     with the king's name in every ordinance, his prayer in the church, his health
                     at the board, and his love in the people's heart. Meantime, our old age finds
                     little honor. Hustled have we been, till driven from town-meetings; dirty water
                     has been cast upon our ruffles by a Whig chambermaid; John Hancock's coachman
                     seizes every opportunity to bespatter us with mud; daily are we hooted by the
                     unbreeched rebel brats; and narrowly, once, did our gray hairs escape the
                     ignominy of tar and feathers. Alas! only that we cannot bear to die till the
                     next royal governor comes over, we would fain be in our quiet grave.</p>
                  <p>Such an old man among new things are we who now hold at arm's length the rebel
                     newspaper of the day.<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6669-00000092"/> The very
                     figure-head, for the thousandth time, elicits a groan of spiteful lamentation.
                     Where are the united heart and crown, the loyal emblem, that used to hallow the
                     sheet on which it was impressed, in our younger days? In its stead we find a
                     continental officer, with the Declaration of Independence in one hand, a drawn
                     sword in the other, and above his head a scroll, bearing the motto, "WE APPEAL
                     TO HEAVEN." Then say we, with a prospective triumph, let Heaven judge, in its
                     own good time! The material of the sheet attracts our scorn. It is a fair
                     specimen of rebel manufacture, thick and coarse, like wrapping-paper, all
                     overspread with little knobs; and of such a deep, dingy blue color, that we
                     wipe our spectacles thrice before we can distinguish a letter of the wretched
                     print. Thus, in all points, the newspaper is a type of the times, far more fit
                     for the rough hands of a democratic mob, than for our own delicate, though bony
                     fingers. Nay; we will not handle it without our gloves!</p>
                  <p>Glancing down the page, our eyes are greeted everywhere by the offer of lands
                     at auction, for sale or to be leased, not by the rightful owners, but a rebel
                     committee; notices of the town constable, that he is authorized to receive the
                     taxes on such an estate, in default of which, that also is to be knocked down
                     to the highest bidder; and notifications of complaints filed by the
                     Attorney-general against certain traitorous absentees, and of confiscations
                     that are to ensue. And who are these traitors? Our own best friends; names as
                     old, once as honored, as any in the land where they are no longer to have a
                     patrimony, nor to be remembered as good men who have passed away. We are
                     ashamed of not relinquishing our little property, too; but comfort ourselves
                     because we still keep our principles, without gratifying the rebels with our
                     plunder. Plunder, indeed, they are seizing everywhere,—by the strong hand at
                     sea, as well as by legal forms on shore. Here are prize-vessels for sale; no
                     French nor Spanish merchantmen, whose wealth is the birthright of British
                     subjects, but hulls of British oak, from Liverpool, Bristol, and the Thames,
                     laden with the king's own stores, for his army in New York. And what a fleet of
                     privateers—pirates, say we—are fitting out for new ravages, with rebellion in
                     their very names! The Free Yankee, the General Green, the Saratoga, the
                     Lafayette, and the Grand Monarch! Yes, the Grand Monarch; so is a French king
                     styled, by the sons of Englishmen. And here we have an ordinance from the Court
                     of Versailles, with the Bourbon's own signature affixed, as if New England were
                     already a French province. Everything is French,—French soldiers, French
                     sailors, French surgeons, and French diseases too, I trow; besides French
                     dancing-masters and French milliners, to debauch our daughters with French
                     fashions! Everything in America is French, except the Canadas, the loyal
                     Canadas, which we helped to wrest from France. And to that old French province
                     the Englishman of the colonies must go to find his country!</p>
                  <p>O the misery of seeing the whole system of things changed in my old days, when
                     I would be loth to change even a pair of buckles! The British coffee-house,
                     where oft we sat, brimfull of wine and loyalty, with the gallant gentlemen of
                     Amherst's army, when we wore a red-coat too,—the British coffee-house,
                     forsooth, must<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6669-00000093"/> now be styled the
                     American, with a golden eagle instead of the royal arms above the door. Even
                     the street it stands in is no longer King-street! Nothing is the king's, except
                     this heavy heart in my old bosom. Wherever I glance my eyes, they meet
                     something that pricks them like a needle. This soap-maker, for instance, this
                     Robert Hewes, has conspired against my peace, by notifying that his shop is
                     situated near Liberty Stump. But when will their misnamed liberty have its true
                     emblem in that Stump, hewn down by British steel!</p>
                  <p>Where shall we buy our next year's almanac? Not this of Weatherwise's,
                     certainly; for it contains a likeness of George Washington, the upright rebel,
                     whom we most hate, though reverentially, as a fallen angel, with his heavenly
                     brightness undiminished, evincing pure fame in an unhallowed cause. And here is
                     a new book for my evening's recreation,—a History of the War till the close of
                     the year 1779, with the heads of thirteen distinguished officers, engraved on
                     copper-plate. A plague upon their heads! We desire not to see them till they
                     grin at us from the balcony before the town-house, fixed on spikes, as the
                     heads of traitors. How bloody-minded the villains make a peaceable old man!
                     What next? An Oration, on the Horrid Massacre of 1770. When that blood was
                     shed,—the first that the British soldier ever drew from the bosoms of our
                     countrymen,—we turned sick at heart, and do so still, as often as they make it
                     reek anew from among the stones in King-street. The pool that we saw that night
                     has swelled into a lake,—English blood and American,—no! all British, all blood
                     of my brethren. And here come down tears. Shame on me, since half of them are
                     shed for rebels! Who are not rebels now! Even the women are thrusting their
                     white hands into the war, and come out in this very paper with proposals to
                     form a society—the lady of George Washington at their head—for clothing the
                     continental troops. They will strip off their stiff petticoats to cover the
                     ragged rascals, and then enlist in the ranks themselves.</p>
                  <p>What have we here? Burgoyne's proclamation turned into Hudibrastic rhyme! And
                     here, some verses against the king, in which the scribbler leaves a blank for
                     the name of George, as if his doggerel might yet exalt him to the pillory.
                     Such, after years of rebellion, is the heart's unconquerable reverence for the
                     Lord's anointed! In the next column, we have scripture parodied in a squib
                     against his sacred Majesty. What would our Puritan great-grandsires have said
                     to that? They never laughed at God's word, though they cut off a king's
                     head.</p>
                  <p>Yes; it was for us to prove how disloyalty goes hand in hand with irreligion,
                     and all other vices come trooping in the train. Now-a-days men commit robbery
                     and sacrilege for the mere luxury of wickedness, as this advertisement
                     testifies. Three hundred pounds reward for the detection of the villains who
                     stole and destroyed the cushions and pulpit drapery of the Brattle-street and
                     Old South churches. Was it a crime? I can scarcely think our temples hallowed,
                     since the king ceased to be prayed for. But it is not temples only that they
                     rob. Here a man offers a thousand dollars—a thousand dollars, in Continental
                     rags!—for the recovery of his stolen cloak, and other articles of clothing.
                     Horse-thieves are<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6669-00000094"/> innumerable. Now
                     is the day when every beggar gets on horse-back. And is not the whole land like
                     a beggar on horse-back riding post to the devil? Ha! here is a murder, too. A
                     woman slain at midnight, by an unknown ruffian, and found cold, stiff and
                     bloody, in her violated bed! Let the hue and cry follow hard after the man in
                     the uniform of blue and buff who last went by that way. My life on it, he is
                     the blood-stained ravisher! These deserters whom we see proclaimed in every
                     column,—proof that the banditti are as false to their stars and stripes as to
                     the Holy Red-cross,—they bring the crimes of a rebel camp into a soil well
                     suited to them; the bosom of a people, without the heart that kept them
                     virtuous—their king!</p>
                  <p>Here, flaunting down a whole column, with official seal and signature, here
                     comes a proclamation. By whose authority? Ah! the United States—these thirteen
                     little anarchies, assembled in that one grand anarchy, their Congress. And what
                     the import? A general Fast. By Heaven! for once the traitorous blockheads have
                     legislated wisely! Yea: let a misguided people kneel down in sackcloth and
                     ashes, from end to end, from border to border, of their wasted country. Well
                     may they fast where there is no food, and cry aloud for whatever remnant of
                     God's mercy their sins may not have exhausted. We too will fast, even at a
                     rebel summons. Pray others as they will, there shall be at least an old man
                     kneeling for the righteous cause. Lord, put down the rebels! God save the
                     king!</p>
                  <p>Peace to the good old Tory! One of our objects has been to exemplify, without
                     softening a single prejudice proper to the character which we assumed, that the
                     Americans who clung to the losing side in the Revolution, were men greatly to
                     be pitied, and often worthy of our sympathy. It would be difficult to say whose
                     lot was most lamentable, that of the active Tories, who gave up their
                     patrimonies for a pittance from the British pension-roll, and their native land
                     for a cold reception in their miscalled home, or the passive ones who remained
                     behind to endure the coldness of former friends, and the public opprobrium, as
                     despised citizens, under a government which they abhorred. In justice to the
                     old gentleman who has favored us with his discontented musings, we must remark
                     that the state of the country, so far as can be gathered from these papers, was
                     of dismal augury for the tendencies of democratic rule. It was pardonable in
                     the conservative of that day to mistake the temporary evils of a change for
                     permanent diseases of the system which that change was to establish. A
                     revolution, or anything that interrupts social order, may afford opportunities
                     for the individual display of eminent virtues; but its effects are pernicious
                     to general morality. Most people are so constituted that they can be virtuous
                     only in a certain routine; and an irregular course of public affairs
                     demoralizes them. One great source of disorder was the multitude of disbanded
                     troops, who were continually returning home, after terms of service just long
                     enough to give them a distaste to peaceable occupations; neither citizens nor
                     soldiers, they were very liable to become ruffians. Almost all our impressions
                     in regard to this period are unpleasant, whether referring to the state of
                     civil society, or to the character of the contest, which, especially where
                     native Americans were opposed to each other, was waged with the deadly
                        hatred<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6669-00000095"/> of fraternal enemies. It
                     is the beauty of war, for men to commit mutual havoc with undisturbed good
                     humor.</p>
                  <p>The present volume of newspapers contains fewer characteristic traits than any
                     which we have looked over. Except for the peculiarities attendant on the
                     passing struggle, manners seem to have taken a modern cast. Whatever antique
                     fashions lingered into the war of the Revolution, or beyond it, they were not
                     so strongly marked as to leave their traces in the public journals. Moreover,
                     the old newspapers had an indescribable picturesqueness, not to be found in the
                     later ones. Whether it be something in the literary execution, or the ancient
                     print and paper, and the idea that those same musty pages have been handled by
                     people once alive and bustling amid the scenes there recorded, yet now in their
                     graves beyond the memory of man; so it is, that in those elder volumes we seem
                     to find the life of a past age preserved between the leaves, like a dry
                     specimen of foliage. It is so difficult to discover what touches are really
                     picturesque, that we doubt whether our attempts have produced any similar
                     effect.</p>

               <head>THE MAN OF ADAMANT:</head>
               <head type="sub">AN APOLOGUE.</head>
               <p>IN the old times of religious gloom and intolerance, lived Richard Digby, the
                  gloomiest and most intolerant of a stern brotherhood. His plan of salvation was so
                  narrow, that, like a plank in a tempestuous sea, it could avail no sinner but
                  himself, who bestrode it triumphantly, and hurled anathemas against the wretches
                  whom he saw struggling with the billows of eternal death. In his view of the
                  matter, it was a most abominable crime—as, indeed, it is a great folly—for men to
                  trust to their own strength, or even to grapple to any other fragment of the
                  wreck, save this narrow plank, which, moreover, he took special care to keep out
                  of their reach. In other words, as his creed was like no man's else, and being
                  well pleased that Providence had intrusted him alone, of mortals, with the
                  treasure of a true faith, Richard Digby determined to seclude himself to the sole
                  and constant enjoyment of his happy fortune.</p>
               <p>"And verily," thought he, "I deem it a chief condition of Heaven's mercy to
                  myself, that I hold no communion with those abominable myriads which it hath cast
                  off to perish. Peradventure, were I to tarry longer in the tents of Kedar, the
                  gracious boon would be revoked, and I also be swallowed up in the deluge of wrath,
                  or consumed in the storm of fire and brimstone, or involved in<pb n="194-195"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000096"/> whatever new kind of ruin is ordained for the
                  horrible perversity of this generation."</p>
               <p>So Richard Digby took an axe, to hew space enough for a tabernacle in the
                  wilderness, and some few other necessaries, especially a sword and gun, to smite
                  and slay any intruder upon his hallowed seclusion; and plunged into the dreariest
                  depths of the forest. On its verge, however, he paused a moment, to shake off the
                  dust of his feet against the village where he had dwelt, and to invoke a curse on
                  the meeting-house, which he regarded as a temple of heathen idolatry. He felt a
                  curiosity, also, to see whether the fire and brimstone would not rush down from
                  Heaven at once, now that the one righteous man had provided for his own safety.
                  But, as the sunshine continued to fall peacefully on the cottages and fields, and
                  the husbandmen labored and children played, and as there were many tokens of
                  present happiness, and nothing ominous of a speedy judgment, he turned away,
                  somewhat disappointed. The further he went, however, and the lonelier he felt
                  himself, and the thicker the trees stood along his path, and the darker the shadow
                  overhead, so much the more did Richard Digby exult. He talked to himself, as he
                  strode onward; he read his Bible to himself, as he sat beneath the trees; and, as
                  the gloom of the forest hid the blessed sky, I had almost added, that, at morning,
                  noon, and eventide, he prayed to himself. So congenial was this mode of life to
                  his disposition, that he often laughed to himself, but was displeased when an echo
                  tossed him back the long, loud roar.</p>
               <p>In this manner, he journeyed onward three days and two nights, and came, on the
                  third evening, to the mouth of a cave, which, at first sight, reminded him of
                  Elijah's cave at Horeb, though perhaps it more resembled Abraham's sepulchral
                  cave, at Machpelah. It entered into the heart of a rocky hill. There was so dense
                  a veil of tangled foliage about it, that none but a sworn lover of gloomy recesses
                  would have discovered the low arch of its entrance, or have dared to step within
                  its vaulted chamber, where the burning eyes of a panther might encounter him. If
                  Nature meant this remote and dismal cavern for the use of man, it could only be to
                  bury in its gloom the victims of a pestilence, and then to block up its mouth with
                  stones, and avoid the spot forever after. There was nothing bright nor cheerful
                  near it, except a bubbling fountain, some twenty paces off, at which Richard Digby
                  hardly threw away a glance. But he thrust his head into the cave, shivered, and
                  congratulated himself.</p>
               <p>"The finger of Providence hath pointed my way!" cried he, aloud, while the
                  tomb-like den returned a strange echo, as if some one within were mocking him.
                  "Here my soul will be at peace; for the wicked will not find me. Here I can read
                  the Scriptures, and be no more provoked with lying interpretations. Here I can
                  offer up acceptable prayers, because my voice will not be mingled with the sinful
                  supplications of the multitude. Of a truth, the only way to heaven leadeth through
                  the narrow entrance of this cave,—and I alone have found it!"</p>
               <p>In regard to this cave, it was observable that the roof, so far as the imperfect
                  light permitted it to be seen, was hung with substances resembling opaque icicles;
                  for the damps of unknown centuries, dripping down continually,<pb n="196-197"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000097"/> had become as hard as adamant; and wherever that
                  moisture fell, it seemed to possess the power of converting what it bathed to
                  stone. The fallen leaves and sprigs of foliage, which the wind had swept into the
                  cave, and the little feathery shrubs, rooted near the threshold, were not wet with
                  a natural dew, but had been embalmed by this wondrous process. And here I am put
                  in mind that Richard Digby, before he withdrew himself from the world, was
                  supposed by skilful physicians to have contracted a disease for which no remedy
                  was written in their medical books. It was a deposition of calculous particles
                  within his heart, caused by an obstructed circulation of the blood; and, unless a
                  miracle should be wrought for him, there was danger that the malady might act on
                  the entire substance of the organ, and change his fleshy heart to stone. Many,
                  indeed, affirmed that the process was already near its consummation. Richard
                  Digby, however, could never be convinced that any such direful work was going on
                  within him; nor when he saw the sprigs of marble foliage, did his heart even throb
                  the quicker, at the similitude suggested by these once tender herbs. It may be
                  that this same insensibility was a symptom of the disease.</p>
               <p>Be that as it might, Richard Digby was well contented with his sepulchral cave. So
                  dearly did he love this congenial spot, that, instead of going a few paces to the
                  bubbling spring for water, he allayed his thirst with now and then a drop of
                  moisture from the roof, which, had it fallen anywhere but on his tongue, would
                  have been congealed into a pebble. For a man predisposed to stoniness of the
                  heart, this surely was unwholesome liquor. But there he dwelt, for three days
                  more, eating herbs and roots, drinking his own destruction, sleeping, as it were,
                  in a tomb, and awaking to the solitude of death, yet esteeming this horrible mode
                  of life as hardly inferior to celestial bliss. Perhaps superior; for, above the
                  sky, there would be angels to disturb him. At the close of the third day, he sat
                  in the portal of his mansion, reading the Bible aloud, because no other ear could
                  profit by it, and reading it amiss, because the rays of the setting sun did not
                  penetrate the dismal depth of shadow round about him, nor fall upon the sacred
                  page. Suddenly, however, a faint gleam of light was thrown over the volume, and,
                  raising his eyes, Richard Digby saw that a young woman stood before the mouth of
                  the cave, and that the sunbeams bathed her white garment, which thus seemed to
                  possess a radiance of its own.</p>
               <p>"Good-evening, Richard," said the girl; "I have come from afar to find thee."</p>
               <p>The slender grace and gentle loveliness of this young woman were at once
                  recognized by Richard Digby. Her name was Mary Goffe. She had been a convert to
                  his preaching of the word in England, before he yielded himself to that exclusive
                  bigotry which now enfolded him with such an iron grasp that no other sentiment
                  could reach his bosom. When he came a pilgrim to America, she had remained in her
                  father's hall; but now, as it appeared, had crossed the ocean after him, impelled
                  by the same faith that led other exiles hither, and perhaps by love almost as
                  holy. What else but faith and love united could have sustained so delicate a
                  creature, wandering thus far into the forest, with her golden hair dishevelled by
                  the boughs, and her feet wounded by the thorns? Yet, weary and faint though she
                  must have<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6669-00000098"/> been, and affrighted at the
                  dreariness of the cave, she looked on the lonely man with a mild and pitying
                  expression, such as might beam from an angel's eyes, towards an afflicted mortal.
                  But the recluse, frowning sternly upon her, and keeping his finger between the
                  leaves of his half-closed Bible, motioned her away with his hand.</p>
               <p>"Off!" cried he. "I am sanctified, and thou art sinful. Away!"</p>
               <p>"O, Richard," said she, earnestly, "I have come this weary way because I heard
                  that a grievous distemper had seized upon thy heart; and a great Physician hath
                  given me the skill to cure it. There is no other remedy than this which I have
                  brought thee. Turn me not away, therefore, nor refuse my medicine; for then must
                  this dismal cave be thy sepulchre."</p>
               <p>"Away!" replied Richard Digby, still with a dark frown. "My heart is in better
                  condition than thine own. Leave me, earthly one; for the sun is almost set; and
                  when no light reaches the door of the cave, then is my prayer-time."</p>
               <p>Now, great as was her need, Mary Goffe did not plead with this stony-hearted man
                  for shelter and protection, nor ask anything whatever for her own sake. All her
                  zeal was for his welfare.</p>
               <p>"Come back with me!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands,—"come back to thy
                  fellow-men; for they need thee, Richard, and thou hast ten-fold need of them. Stay
                  not in this evil den; for the air is chill, and the damps are fatal; nor will any
                  that perish within it ever find the path to heaven. Hasten hence, I entreat thee,
                  for thine own soul's sake; for either the roof will fall upon thy head, or some
                  other speedy destruction is at hand."</p>
               <p>"Perverse woman!" answered Richard Digby, laughing aloud,—for he was moved to
                  bitter mirth by her foolish vehemence,—"I tell thee that the path to heaven
                  leadeth straight through this narrow portal where I sit. And, moreover, the
                  destruction thou speakest of is ordained, not for this blessed cave, but for all
                  other habitations of mankind, throughout the earth. Get thee hence speedily, that
                  thou mayst have thy share!"</p>
               <p>So saying, he opened his Bible again, and fixed his eyes intently on the page,
                  being resolved to withdraw his thoughts from this child of sin and wrath, and to
                  waste no more of his holy breath upon her. The shadow had now grown so deep, where
                  he was sitting, that he made continual mistakes in what he read, converting all
                  that was gracious and merciful to denunciations of vengeance and unutterable woe
                  on every created being but himself. Mary Goffe, meanwhile, was leaning against a
                  tree, beside the sepulchral cave, very sad, yet with something heavenly and
                  ethereal in her unselfish sorrow. The light from the setting sun still glorified
                  her form, and was reflected a little way within the darksome den, discovering so
                  terrible a gloom that the maiden shuddered for its self-doomed inhabitant. Espying
                  the bright fountain near at hand, she hastened thither, and scooped up a portion
                  of its water, in a cup of birchen bark. A few tears mingled with the draught, and
                  perhaps gave it all its efficacy. She then returned to the mouth of the cave, and
                  knelt down at Richard Digby's feet.</p>
               <p>"Richard," she said, with passionate fervor, yet a gentleness in all her passion,
                  "I pray thee, by thy hope<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6669-00000099"/> of heaven,
                  and as thou wouldst not dwell in this tomb forever, drink of this hallowed water,
                  be it but a single drop! Then, make room for me by thy side, and let us read
                  together one page of that blessed volume,—and, lastly, kneel down with me and
                  pray! Do this, and thy stony heart shall become softer than a babe's, and all be
                  well."</p>
               <p>But Richard Digby, in utter abhorrence of the proposal, cast the Bible at his
                  feet, and eyed her with such a fixed and evil frown, that he looked less like a
                  living man than a marble statue, wrought by some dark-imagined sculptor to express
                  the most repulsive mood that human features could assume. And, as his look grew
                  even devilish, so, with an equal change, did Mary Goffe become more sad, more
                  mild, more pitiful, more like a sorrowing angel. But, the more heavenly she was,
                  the more hateful did she seem to Richard Digby, who at length raised his hand, and
                  smote down the cup of hallowed water upon the threshold of the cave, thus
                  rejecting the only medicine that could have cured his stony heart. A sweet perfume
                  lingered in the air for a moment, and then was gone.</p>
               <p>"Tempt me no more, accursed woman," exclaimed he, still with his marble frown,
                  "lest I smite thee down also! What hast thou to do with my Bible?—what with my
                  prayers?—what with my heaven?"</p>
               <p>No sooner had he spoken these dreadful words, than Richard's Digby's heart ceased
                  to beat; while—so the legend says—the form of Mary Goffe melted into the last
                  sunbeams, and returned from the sepulchral cave to heaven. For Mary Goffe had been
                  buried in an English church-yard, months before; and either it was her ghost that
                  haunted the wild forest, or else a dreamlike spirit, typifying pure Religion.</p>
               <p>Above a century afterwards, when the trackless forest of Richard Digby's day had
                  long been interspersed with settlements, the children of a neighboring farmer were
                  playing at the foot of a hill. The trees, on account of the rude and broken
                  surface of this acclivity, had never been felled, and were crowded so densely
                  together as to hide all but a few rocky prominences, wherever their roots could
                  grapple with the soil. A little boy and girl, to conceal themselves from their
                  playmates, had crept into the deepest shade, where not only the darksome pines,
                  but a thick veil of creeping plants suspended from an overhanging rock, combined
                  to make a twilight at noonday, and almost a midnight at all other seasons. There
                  the children hid themselves, and shouted, repeating the cry at intervals, till the
                  whole party of pursuers were drawn thither, and pulling aside the matted foliage,
                  let in a doubtful glimpse of daylight. But scarcely was this accomplished, when
                  the little group uttered a simultaneous shriek, and tumbled headlong down the
                  hill, making the best of their way homeward, without a second glance into the
                  gloomy recess. Their father, unable to comprehend what had so startled them, took
                  his axe, and, by felling one or two trees, and tearing away the creeping plants,
                  laid the mystery open to the day. He had discovered the entrance of a cave,
                  closely resembling the mouth of a sepulchre, within which sat the figure of a man,
                  whose gesture and attitude warned the father and children to stand back, while his
                  visage wore a most forbidding frown. This repulsive personage seemed to have been
                  carved in the same gray stone that<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6669-00000100"/>
                  formed the walls and portal of the cave. On minuter inspection, indeed, such
                  blemishes were observed, as made it doubtful whether the figure were really a
                  statue, chiselled by human art, and somewhat worn and defaced by the lapse of
                  ages, or a freak of Nature, who might have chosen to imitate, in stone, her usual
                  handiwork of flesh. Perhaps it was the least unreasonable idea, suggested by this
                  strange spectacle, that the moisture of the cave possessed a petrifying quality,
                  which had thus awfully embalmed a human corpse.</p>
               <p>There was something so frightful in the aspect of this Man of Adamant, that the
                  farmer, the moment that he recovered from the fascination of his first gaze, began
                  to heap stones into the mouth of the cavern. His wife, who had followed him to the
                  hill, assisted her husband's efforts. The children, also, approached as near as
                  they durst, with their little hands full of pebbles, and cast them on the pile.
                  Earth was then thrown into the crevices, and the whole fabric overlaid with sods.
                  Thus all traces of the discovery were obliterated, leaving only a marvellous
                  legend, which grew wilder from one generation to another, as the children told it
                  to their grandchildren, and they to their posterity, till few believed that there
                  had ever been a cavern or a statue, where now they saw but a grassy patch on the
                  shadowy hill-side. Yet, grown people avoid the spot, nor do children play there.
                  Friendship, and Love, and Piety, all human and celestial sympathies, should keep
                  aloof from that hidden cave; for there still sits, and, unless an earthquake
                  crumble down the roof upon his head, shall sit forever, the shape of Richard
                  Digby, in the attitude of repelling the whole race of mortals—not from heaven—but
                  from the horrible loneliness of his dark, cold sepulchre!</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>THE DEVIL IN MANUSCRIPT.</head>
               <p>ON a bitter evening of December, I arrived by mail in a large town, which was then
                  the residence of an intimate friend, one of those gifted youths who cultivate
                  poetry and the belles-lettres, and call themselves students at law. My first
                  business, after supper, was to visit him at the office of his distinguished
                  instructor. As I have said, it was a bitter night, clear starlight, but cold as
                  Nova Zembla—the shop-windows along the street being frosted, so as almost to hide
                  the lights, while the wheels of coaches thundered equally loud over frozen earth
                  and pavements of stone. There was no snow, either on the ground or the roofs of
                  the houses. The wind blew so violently, that I had but to spread my cloak like a
                  mainsail, and scud along the street at the rate of ten knots, greatly envied by
                  other navigators, who were beating slowly up, with the gale right in their teeth.
                  One of these I capsized, but was gone on the wings of the wind before he could
                  even vociferate an oath.</p>
               <p>After this picture of an inclement night, behold us seated by a great blazing
                  fire, which looked so comfortable and delicious that I felt inclined to lie down
                  and roll among the hot coals. The usual furniture of a lawyer's office was around
                  us,—rows of volumes in sheep-skin, and a multitude of writs, summonses, and other
                  legal papers, scattered over the desks and tables. But there were certain objects
                  which seemed to intimate<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6669-00000101"/> that we had
                  little dread of the intrusion of clients, or of the learned counsellor himself,
                  who, indeed, was attending court in a distant town. A tall, decanter-shaped bottle
                  stood on the table, between two tumblers, and beside a pile of blotted
                  manuscripts, altogether dissimilar to any law documents recognized in our courts.
                  My friend, whom I shall call Oberon,—it was a name of fancy and friendship between
                  him and me,—my friend Oberon looked at these papers with a peculiar expression of
                  disquietude.</p>
               <p>"I do believe," said he, soberly, "or, at least, I could believe, if I chose, that
                  there is a devil in this pile of blotted papers. You have read them, and know what
                  I mean,—that conception in which I endeavored to embody the character of a fiend,
                  as represented in our traditions and the written records of witchcraft. O! I have
                  a horror of what was created in my own brain, and shudder at the manuscripts in
                  which I gave that dark idea a sort of material existence. Would they were out of
                  my sight!"</p>
               <p>"And of mine, too," thought I.</p>
               <p>"You remember," continued Oberon, "how the hellish thing used to suck away the
                  happiness of those who, by a simple concession that seemed almost innocent,
                  subjected themselves to his power. Just so my peace is gone, and all by these
                  accursed manuscripts. Have you felt nothing of the same influence?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing," replied I, "unless the spell be hid in a desire to turn novelist, after
                  reading your delightful tales."</p>
               <p>"Novelist!" exclaimed Oberon, half seriously. "Then, indeed, my devil has his claw
                  on you! You are gone! You cannot even pray for deliverance! But we will be the
                  last and only victims; for this night I mean to burn the manuscripts, and commit
                  the fiend to his retribution in the flames."</p>
               <p>"Burn your tales!" repeated I, startled at the desperation of the idea.</p>
               <p>"Even so," said the author, despondingly. "You cannot conceive what an effect the
                  composition of these tales has had on me. I have become ambitious of a bubble, and
                  careless of solid reputation. I am surrounding myself with shadows, which bewilder
                  me, by aping the realities of life. They have drawn me aside from the beaten path
                  of the world, and led me into a strange sort of solitude,—a solitude in the midst
                  of men,—where nobody wishes for what I do, nor thinks nor feels as I do. The tales
                  have done all this. When they are ashes, perhaps I shall be as I was before they
                  had existence. Moreover, the sacrifice is less than you may suppose; since nobody
                  will publish them."</p>
               <p>"That does make a difference, indeed," said I.</p>
               <p>"They have been offered, by letter," continued Oberon, reddening with vexation,
                  "to some seventeen booksellers. It would make you stare to read their answers; and
                  read them you should, only that I burnt them as fast as they arrived. One man
                  publishes nothing but schoolbooks; another has five novels already under
                  examination."</p>
               <p>"What a voluminous mass the unpublished literature of America must be!" cried
                  I.</p>
               <p>"O! the Alexandrian manuscripts were nothing to it," said my friend. "Well,
                  another gentleman is just giving up business, on purpose, I verily believe, to
                     escape<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6669-00000102"/> publishing my book. Several,
                  however, would not absolutely decline the agency, on my advancing half the cost of
                  an edition, and giving bonds for the remainder, besides a high percentage to
                  themselves, whether the book sells or not. Another advises a subscription."</p>
               <p>"The villain!" exclaimed I.</p>
               <p>"A fact!" said Oberon. "In short, of all the seventeen booksellers, only one has
                  vouchsafed even to read my tales; and he—a literary dabbler himself, I should
                  judge—has the impertinence to criticize them, proposing what he calls vast
                  improvements, and concluding, after a general sentence of condemnation, with the
                  definitive assurance that he will not be concerned on any terms."</p>
               <p>"It might not be amiss to pull that fellow's nose," remarked I.</p>
               <p>"If the whole 'trade' had one common nose, there would be some satisfaction in
                  pulling it," answered the author. "But, there does seem to be one honest man among
                  these seventeen unrighteous ones; and he tells me fairly, that no American
                  publisher will meddle with an American work,—seldom if by a known writer, and
                  never if by a new one,—unless at the writer's risk."</p>
               <p>"The paltry rogues!" cried I. "Will they live by literature, and yet risk nothing
                  for its sake? But, after all, you might publish on your own account."</p>
               <p>"And so I might," replied Oberon. "But the devil of the business is this. These
                  people have put me so out of conceit with the tales, that I loathe the very
                  thought of them, and actually experience a physical sickness of the stomach,
                  whenever I glance at them on the table. I tell you there is a demon in them! I
                  anticipate a wild enjoyment in seeing them in the blaze; such as I should feel in
                  taking vengeance on an enemy, or destroying something noxious."</p>
               <p>I did not very strenuously oppose this determination, being privately of opinion,
                  in spite of my partiality for the author, that his tales would make a more
                  brilliant appearance in the fire than anywhere else. Before proceeding to
                  execution, we broached the bottle of champagne, which Oberon had provided for
                  keeping up his spirits in this doleful business. We swallowed each a tumblerful,
                  in sparkling commotion; it went bubbling down our throats, and brightened my eyes
                  at once, but left my friend sad and heavy as before. He drew the tales towards
                  him, with a mixture of natural affection and natural disgust, like a father taking
                  a deformed infant into his arms.</p>
               <p>"Pooh! Pish! Pshaw!" exclaimed he, holding them at arm's length. "It was Gray's
                  idea of heaven, to lounge on a sofa and read new novels. Now, what more
                  appropriate torture would Dante himself have contrived, for the sinner who
                  perpetrates a bad book, than to be continually turning over the manuscript?"</p>
               <p>"It would fail of effect," said I, "because a bad author is always his own great
                  admirer."</p>
               <p>"I lack that one characteristic of my tribe,—the only desirable one," observed
                  Oberon. "But how many recollections throng upon me, as I turn over these leaves!
                  This scene came into my fancy as I walked along a hilly road, on a starlight
                  October evening; in the pure and bracing air, I became all soul, and felt as if I
                  could climb the sky, and run a race along the Milky Way. Here is another tale, in
                  which I wrapt myself during a dark and dreary night-ride in the month of<pb
                     n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6669-00000103"/> March, till the rattling of the wheels
                  and the voices of my companions seemed like faint sounds of a dream, and my
                  visions a bright reality. That scribbled page describes shadows which I summoned
                  to my bedside at midnight: they would not depart when I bade them; the gray dawn
                  came, and found me wide awake and feverish, the victim of my own
                  enchantments!"</p>
               <p>"There must have been a sort of happiness in all this," said I, smitten with a
                  strange longing to make proof of it.</p>
               <p>"There may be happiness in a fever fit," replied the author. "And then the various
                  moods in which I wrote! Sometimes my ideas were like precious stones under the
                  earth, requiring toil to dig them up, and care to polish and brighten them; but
                  often, a delicious stream of thought would gush out upon the page at once, like
                  water sparkling up suddenly in the desert; and when it had passed, I gnawed my pen
                  hopelessly, or blundered on with cold and miserable toil, as if there were a wall
                  of ice between me and my subject."</p>
               <p>"Do you now perceive a corresponding difference," inquired I, "between the
                  passages which you wrote so coldly, and those fervid flashes of the mind?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Oberon, tossing the manuscripts on the table. "I find no traces of the
                  golden pen, with which I wrote in characters of fire. My treasure of fairy coin is
                  changed to worthless dross. My picture, painted in what seemed the loveliest hues,
                  presents nothing but a faded and indistinguishable surface. I have been eloquent
                  and poetical and humorous in a dream—and behold! it is all nonsense, now that I am
                  awake."</p>
               <p>My friend now threw sticks of wood and dry chips upon the fire, and seeing it
                  blaze like Nebuchadnezzar's furnace, seized the champagne-bottle, and drank two or
                  three brimming bumpers, successively. The heady liquor combined with his agitation
                  to throw him into a species of rage. He laid violent hands on the tales. In one
                  instant more, their faults and beauties would alike have vanished in a glowing
                  purgatory. But, all at once, I remembered passages of high imagination, deep
                  pathos, original thoughts, and points of such varied excellence, that the vastness
                  of the sacrifice struck me most forcibly. I caught his arm.</p>
               <p>"Surely, you do not mean to burn them!" I exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Let me alone!" cried Oberon, his eyes flashing fire. "I will burn them! Not a
                  scorched syllable shall escape! Would you have me a damned author?—To undergo
                  sneers, taunts, abuse, and cold neglect, and faint praise, bestowed, for pity's
                  sake, against the giver's conscience! A hissing and a laughing-stock to my own
                  traitorous thoughts! An outlaw from the protection of the grave—one whose ashes
                  every careless foot might spurn, unhonored in life, and remembered scornfully in
                  death! Am I to bear all this, when yonder fire will insure me from the whole? No!
                  There go the tales! May my hand wither when it would write another!"</p>
               <p>The deed was done. He had thrown the manuscripts into the hottest of the fire,
                  which at first seemed to shrink away, but soon curled around them, and made them a
                  part of its own fervent brightness. Oberon stood gazing at the conflagration, and
                  shortly began to soliloquize, in the wildest strain, as if Fancy resisted and
                  became riotous, at the moment when he would have compelled her<pb n="210-211"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000104"/> to ascend that funeral pile. His words described
                  objects which he appeared to discern in the fire, fed by his own precious
                  thoughts; perhaps the thousand visions which the writer's magic had incorporated
                  with these pages became visible to him in the dissolving heat, brightening forth
                  ere they vanished forever; while the smoke, the vivid sheets of flame, the ruddy
                  and whitening coals, caught the aspect of a varied scenery.</p>
               <p>"They blaze," said he, "as if I had steeped them in the intensest spirit of
                  genius. There I see my lovers clasped in each other's arms. How pure the flame
                  that bursts from their glowing hearts! And yonder the features of a villain
                  writhing in the fire that shall torment him to eternity. My holy men, my pious and
                  angelic women, stand like martyrs amid the flames, their mild eyes lifted
                  heavenward. Ring out the bells! A city is on fire. See!—destruction roars through
                  my dark forests, while the lakes boil up in steaming billows, and the mountains
                  are volcanoes, and the sky kindles with a lurid brightness! All elements are but
                  one pervading flame! Ha! The fiend!"</p>
               <p>I was somewhat startled by this latter exclamation. The tales were almost
                  consumed, but just then threw forth a broad sheet of fire, which flickered as with
                  laughter, making the whole room dance in its brightness, and then roared
                  portentously up the chimney.</p>
               <p>"You saw him? You must have seen him!" cried Oberon. "How he glared at me and
                  laughed, in that last sheet of flame, with just the features that I imagined for
                  him! Well! The tales are gone."</p>
               <p>The papers were indeed reduced to a heap of black cinders, with a multitude of
                  sparks hurrying confusedly among them, the traces of the pen being now represented
                  by white lines, and the whole mass fluttering to and fro, in the draughts of air.
                  The destroyer knelt down to look at them.</p>
               <p>"What is more potent than fire!" said he, in his gloomiest tone. "Even thought,
                  invisible and incorporeal as it is, cannot escape it. In this little time, it has
                  annihilated the creations of long nights and days, which I could no more
                  reproduce, in their first glow and freshness, than cause ashes and whitened bones
                  to rise up and live. There, too, I sacrificed the unborn children of my mind. All
                  that I had accomplished—all that I planned for future years—has perished by one
                  common ruin, and left only this heap of embers! The deed has been my fate. And
                  what remains? A weary and aimless life,—a long repentance of this hour,—and at
                  last an obscure grave, where they will bury and forget me!"</p>
               <p>As the author concluded his dolorous moan, the extinguished embers arose and
                  settled down and arose again, and finally flew up the chimney, like a demon with
                  sable wings. Just as they disappeared, there was a loud and solitary cry in the
                  street below us. "Fire! Fire!" Other voices caught up that terrible word, and it
                  speedily became the shout of a multitude. Oberon started to his feet, in fresh
                  excitement.</p>
               <p>"A fire on such a night!" cried he. "The wind blows a gale, and wherever it whirls
                  the flames, the roofs will flash up like gunpowder. Every pump is frozen up, and
                  boiling water would turn to ice the moment it was flung from the engine. In an
                  hour, this wooden town will be one great bonfire! What a glorious scene for my
                  next——Pshaw!"</p>
               <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6669-00000105"/>
               <p>The street was now all alive with footsteps, and the air full of voices. We heard
                  one engine thundering round a corner, and another rattling from a distance over
                  the pavements. The bells of three steeples clanged out at once, spreading the
                  alarm to many a neighboring town, and expressing hurry, confusion and terror, so
                  inimitably that I could almost distinguish in their peal the burthen of the
                  universal cry—"Fire! Fire! Fire!"</p>
               <p>"What is so eloquent as their iron tongues!" exclaimed Oberon. "My heart leaps and
                  trembles, but not with fear. And that other sound, too,—deep and awful as a mighty
                  organ,—the roar and thunder of the multitude on the pavement below! Come! We are
                  losing time. I will cry out in the loudest of the uproar, and mingle my spirit
                  with the wildest of the confusion, and be a bubble on the top of the ferment!"</p>
               <p>From the first outcry, my forebodings had warned me of the true object and centre
                  of alarm. There was nothing now but uproar, above, beneath, and around us;
                  footsteps stumbling pell-mell up the public staircase, eager shouts and heavy
                  thumps at the door, the whiz and dash of water from the engines, and the crash of
                  furniture thrown upon the pavement. At once, the truth flashed upon my friend. His
                  frenzy took the hue of joy, and, with a wild gesture of exultation, he leaped
                  almost to the ceiling of the chamber.</p>
               <p>"My tales!" cried Oberon. "The chimney! The roof! The Fiend has gone forth by
                  night, and startled thousands in fear and wonder from their beds! Here I stand—a
                  triumphant author! Huzza! Huzza! My brain has set the town on fire! Huzza!"</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>JOHN INGLEFIELD'S THANKSGIVING.</head>
               <p>ON the evening of Thanksgiving day, John Inglefield, the blacksmith, sat in his
                  elbow-chair, among those who had been keeping festival at his board. Being the
                  central figure of the domestic circle, the fire threw its strongest light on his
                  massive and sturdy frame, reddening his rough visage, so that it looked like the
                  head of an iron statue, all a-glow, from his own forge, and with its features
                  rudely fashioned on his own anvil. At John Inglefield's right hand was an empty
                  chair. The other places round the hearth were filled by the members of the family,
                  who all sat quietly, while, with a semblance of fantastic merriment, their shadows
                  danced on the wall behind them. One of the group was John Inglefield's son, who
                  had been bred at college, and was now a student of theology at Andover. There was
                  also a daughter of sixteen, whom nobody could look at without thinking of a
                  rose-bud almost blossomed. The only other person at the fireside was Robert Moore,
                  formerly an apprentice of the blacksmith, but now his journeyman, and who seemed
                  more like an own son of John Inglefield than did the pale and slender student.</p>
               <p>Only these four had kept New England's festival beneath that roof. The vacant
                  chair at John Inglefield's right hand was in memory of his wife, whom death had
                  snatched from him since the previous Thanksgiving. With a feeling that few would
                  have looked for<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6669-00000106"/> in his rough nature,
                  the bereaved husband had himself set the chair in its place next his own; and
                  often did his eye glance thitherward, as if he deemed it possible that the cold
                  grave might send back its tenant to the cheerful fireside, at least for that one
                  evening. Thus did he cherish the grief that was dear to him. But there was another
                  grief which he would fain have torn from his heart; or, since that could never be,
                  have buried it too deep for others to behold, or for his own remembrance. Within
                  the past year another member of his household had gone from him, but not to the
                  grave. Yet they kept no vacant chair for her.</p>
               <p>While John Inglefield and his family were sitting round the hearth with the
                  shadows dancing behind them on the wall, the outer door was opened, and a light
                  footstep came along the passage. The latch of the inner door was lifted by some
                  familiar hand, and a young girl came in, wearing a cloak and hood, which she took
                  off, and laid on the table beneath the looking-glass. Then, after gazing a moment
                  at the fireside circle, she approached, and took the seat at John Inglefield's
                  right hand, as if it had been reserved on purpose for her.</p>
               <p>"Here I am, at last, father," said she. "You ate your Thanksgiving dinner without
                  me, but I have come back to spend the evening with you."</p>
               <p>Yes, it was Prudence Inglefield. She wore the same neat and maidenly attire which
                  she had been accustomed to put on when the household work was over for the day,
                  and her hair was parted from her brow, in the simple and modest fashion that
                  became her best of all. If her cheek might otherwise have been pale, yet the glow
                  of the fire suffused it with a healthful bloom. If she had spent the many months
                  of her absence in guilt and infamy, yet they seemed to have left no traces on her
                  gentle aspect. She could not have looked less altered, had she merely stepped away
                  from her father's fireside for half an hour, and returned while the blaze was
                  quivering upwards from the same brands that were burning at her departure. And to
                  John Inglefield she was the very image of his buried wife, such as he remembered
                  her on the first Thanksgiving which they had passed under their own roof.
                  Therefore, though naturally a stern and rugged man, he could not speak unkindly to
                  his sinful child, nor yet could he take her to his bosom.</p>
               <p>"You are welcome home, Prudence," said he, glancing sideways at her, and his voice
                  faltered. "Your mother would have rejoiced to see you, but she has been gone from
                  us these four months."</p>
               <p>"I know it, father, I know it," replied Prudence, quickly. "And yet, when I first
                  came in, my eyes were so dazzled by the fire-light that she seemed to be sitting
                  in this very chair!"</p>
               <p>By this time, the other members of the family had begun to recover from their
                  surprise, and became sensible that it was no ghost from the grave, nor vision of
                  their vivid recollections, but Prudence, her own self. Her brother was the next
                  that greeted her. He advanced and held out his hand affectionately, as a brother
                  should; yet not entirely like a brother, for, with all his kindness, he was still
                  a clergyman, and speaking to a child of sin.</p>
               <p>"Sister Prudence," said he, earnestly, "I rejoice that a merciful Providence hath
                  turned your steps homeward,<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6669-00000107"/> in time for
                  me to bid you a last farewell. In a few weeks, sister, I am to sail as a
                  missionary to the far islands of the Pacific. There is not one of these beloved
                  faces that I shall ever hope to behold again on this earth. O, may I see all of
                  them—yours and all—beyond the grave!"</p>
               <p>A shadow flitted across the girl's countenance.</p>
               <p>"The grave is very dark, brother," answered she, withdrawing her hand somewhat
                  hastily from his grasp. "You must look your last at me by the light of this
                  fire."</p>
               <p>While this was passing, the twin-girl—the rose-bud that had grown on the same stem
                  with the cast-away—stood gazing at her sister, longing to fling herself upon her
                  bosom, so that the tendrils of their hearts might intertwine again. At first she
                  was restrained by mingled grief and shame, and by a dread that Prudence was too
                  much changed to respond to her affection, or that her own purity would be felt as
                  a reproach by the lost one. But, as she listened to the familiar voice, while the
                  face grew more and more familiar, she forgot everything save that Prudence had
                  come back. Springing forward, she would have clasped her in a close embrace. At
                  that very instant, however, Prudence started from her chair, and held out both her
                  hands, with a warning gesture.</p>
               <p>"No, Mary,—no, my sister," cried she, "do not you touch me. Your bosom must not be
                  pressed to mine!"</p>
               <p>Mary shuddered and stood still, for she felt that something darker than the grave
                  was between Prudence and herself, though they seemed so near each other in the
                  light of their father's hearth, where they had grown up together. Meanwhile
                  Prudence threw her eyes around the room, in search of one who had not yet bidden
                  her welcome. He had withdrawn from his seat by the fireside, and was standing near
                  the door, with his face averted, so that his features could be discerned only by
                  the flickering shadow of the profile upon the wall. But Prudence called to him, in
                  a cheerful and kindly tone:</p>
               <p>"Come, Robert," said she, "won't you shake hands with your old friend?"</p>
               <p>Robert Moore held back for a moment, but affection struggled powerfully, and
                  overcame his pride and resentment; he rushed towards Prudence, seized her hand,
                  and pressed it to his bosom.</p>
               <p>"There, there, Robert!" said she, smiling sadly, as she withdrew her hand, "you
                  must not give me too warm a welcome."</p>
               <p>And now, having exchanged greetings with each member of the family, Prudence again
                  seated herself in the chair at John Inglefield's right hand. She was naturally a
                  girl of quick and tender sensibilities, glad-some in her general mood, but with a
                  bewitching pathos interfused among her merriest words and deeds. It was remarked
                  of her, too, that she had a faculty, even from childhood, of throwing her own
                  feelings like a spell over her companions. Such as she had been in her days of
                  innocence, so did she appear this evening. Her friends, in the surprise and
                  bewilderment of her return, almost forgot that she had ever left them, or that she
                  had forfeited any of her claims to their affection. In the morning, perhaps, they
                  might have looked at her with altered<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6669-00000108"/>
                  eyes, but by the Thanksgiving fireside they felt only that their own Prudence had
                  come back to them, and were thankful. John Inglefield's rough visage brightened
                  with the glow of his heart, as it grew warm and merry within him; once or twice,
                  even, he laughed till the room rang again, yet seemed startled by the echo of his
                  own mirth. The grave young minister became as frolicsome as a school-boy. Mary,
                  too, the rose-bud, forgot that her twin-blossom had ever been torn from the stem,
                  and trampled in the dust. And as for Robert Moore, he gazed at Prudence with the
                  bashful earnestness of love new-born, while she, with sweet maiden coquetry, half
                  smiled upon and half discouraged him.</p>
               <p>In short, it was one of those intervals when sorrow vanishes in its own depth of
                  shadow, and joy starts forth in transitory brightness. When the clock struck
                  eight, Prudence poured out her father's customary draught of herb tea, which had
                  been steeping by the fire-side ever since twilight.</p>
               <p>"God bless you, child!" said John Inglefield, as he took the cup from her hand;
                  "you have made your old father happy again. But we miss your mother sadly,
                  Prudence, sadly. It seems as if she ought to be here now."</p>
               <p>"Now, father, or never," replied Prudence.</p>
               <p>It was now the hour for domestic worship. But while the family were making
                  preparations for this duty, they suddenly perceived that Prudence had put on her
                  cloak and hood, and was lifting the latch of the door.</p>
               <p>"Prudence, Prudence! where are you going?" cried they all, with one voice.</p>
               <p>As Prudence passed out of the door, she turned towards them, and flung back her
                  hand with a gesture of farewell. But her face was so changed that they hardly
                  recognized it. Sin and evil passions glowed through its comeliness, and wrought a
                  horrible deformity; a smile gleamed in her eyes, as of triumphant mockery, at
                  their surprise and grief.</p>
               <p>"Daughter," cried John Inglefield, between wrath and sorrow, "stay and be your
                  father's blessing, or take his curse with you!"</p>
               <p>For an instant Prudence lingered and looked back into the fire-lighted room, while
                  her countenance were almost the expression as if she were struggling with a fiend,
                  who had power to seize his victim even within the hallowed precincts of her
                  father's hearth. The fiend prevailed; and Prudence vanished into the outer
                  darkness. When the family rushed to the door, they could see nothing, but heard
                  the sound of wheels rattling over the frozen ground.</p>
               <p>That same night, among the painted beauties at the theatre of a neighboring city,
                  there was one whose dissolute mirth seemed inconsistent with any sympathy for pure
                  affections, and for the joys and griefs which are hallowed by them. Yet this was
                  Prudence Inglefield. Her visit to the Thanksgiving fireside was the realization of
                  one of those waking dreams in which the guilty soul will sometimes stray back to
                  its innocence. But Sin, alas! is careful of her bond-slaves; they hear her voice,
                  perhaps, at the holiest moment, and are constrained to go whither she summons
                  them. The same<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6669-00000109"/> dark power that drew
                  Prudence Inglefield from her father's hearth—the same in its nature, though
                  heightened then to a dread necessity—would snatch a guilty soul from the gate of
                  heaven, and make its sin and its punishment alike eternal.</p>

               <head>OLD TICONDEROGA.</head>
               <head type="sub">A PICTURE OF THE PAST.</head>
               <p>THE greatest attraction, in this vicinity, is the famous old fortress of
                  Ticonderoga, the remains of which are visible from the piazza of the tavern, on a
                  swell of land that shuts in the prospect of the lake. Those celebrated heights,
                  Mount Defiance and Mount Independence, familiar to all Americans in history, stand
                  too prominent not to be recognized, though neither of them precisely correspond to
                  the images excited by their names. In truth, the whole scene, except the interior
                  of the fortress, disappointed me. Mount Defiance, which one pictures as a steep,
                  lofty, and rugged hill, of most formidable aspect, frowning down with the grim
                  visage of a precipice on old Ticonderoga, is merely a long and wooded ridge; and
                  bore, at some former period, the gentle name of Sugar Hill. The brow is certainly
                  difficult to climb, and high enough to look into every corner of the fortress. St.
                  Clair's most probable reason, however, for neglecting to occupy it, was the
                  deficiency of troops to man the works already constructed, rather than the
                  supposed inaccessibility of Mount Defiance. It is singular that the French never
                  fortified this height, standing, as it does, in the quarter whence they must have
                  looked for the advance of a British army.</p>
               <p>In my first view of the ruins, I was favored with the<pb n="222-223"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000110"/> scientific guidance of a young lieutenant of
                  engineers, recently from West Point, where he had gained credit for great military
                  genius. I saw nothing but confusion in what chiefly interested him; straight lines
                  and zigzags, defence within defence, wall opposed to wall, and ditch intersecting
                  ditch; oblong squares of masonry below the surface of the earth, and huge mounds,
                  or turf-covered hills of stone, above it. On one of these artificial hillocks, a
                  pine-tree has rooted itself, and grown tall and strong, since the banner-staff was
                  levelled. But where my unmilitary glance could trace no regularity, the young
                  lieutenant was perfectly at home. He fathomed the meaning of every ditch, and
                  formed an entire plan of the fortress from its half-obliterated lines. His
                  description of Ticonderoga would be as accurate as a geometrical theorem, and as
                  barren of the poetry that has clustered round its decay. I viewed Ticonderoga as a
                  place of ancient strength; in ruins for half a century: where the flags of three
                  nations had successively waved, and none waved now; where armies had struggled, so
                  long ago that the bones of the slain were mouldered; where Peace had found a
                  heritage in the forsaken haunts of War. Now the young West Pointer, with his
                  lectures on ravelins, counterscarps, angles, and covered ways, made it an affair
                  of brick and mortar and hewn stone, arranged on certain regular principles, having
                  a good deal to do with mathematics, but nothing at all with poetry.</p>
               <p>I should have been glad of a hoary veteran to totter by my side, and tell me,
                  perhaps, of the French garrisons and their Indian allies,—of Abercrombie, Lord
                  Howe, and Amherst,—of Ethan Allen's triumph and St. Clair's surrender. The old
                  soldier and the old fortress would be emblems of each other. His reminiscences,
                  though vivid as the image of Ticonderoga in the lake, would harmonize with the
                  gray influence of the scene. A survivor of the long-disbanded garrisons, though
                  but a private soldier, might have mustered his dead chiefs and comrades,—some from
                  Westminster Abbey, and English church-yards, and battle-fields in Europe,—others
                  from their graves here in America,—others, not a few, who lie sleeping round the
                  fortress; he might have mustered them all, and bid them march through the ruined
                  gateway, turning their old historic faces on me, as they passed. Next to such a
                  companion, the best is one's own fancy.</p>
               <p>At another visit I was alone, and, after rambling all over the ramparts, sat down
                  to rest myself in one of the roofless barracks. These are old French structures,
                  and appear to have occupied three sides of a large area, now overgrown with grass,
                  nettles, and thistles. The one in which I sat was long and narrow, as all the rest
                  had been, with peaked gables. The exterior walls were nearly entire, constructed
                  of gray, flat, unpicked stones, the aged strength of which promised long to resist
                  the elements, if no other violence should precipitate their fall. The roof,
                  floors, partitions, and the rest of the wood-work, had probably been burnt, except
                  some bars of stanch old oak, which were blackened with fire, but still remained
                  imbedded into the window-sills and over the doors. There were a few particles of
                  plastering near the chimney, scratched with rude figures, perhaps by a soldier's
                  hand. A most luxuriant crop of weeds had sprung up within the edifice, and hid the
                  scattered fragments of the wall. Grass and weeds grew in the windows<pb
                     n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6669-00000111"/> dows, and in all the crevices of the
                  stone, climbing, step by step, till a tuft of yellow flowers was waving on the
                  highest peak of the gable. Some spicy herb diffused a pleasant odor through the
                  ruin. A verdant heap of vegetation had covered the hearth of the second floor,
                  clustering on the very spot where the huge logs had mouldered to glowing coals,
                  and flourished beneath the broad flue, which had so often puffed the smoke over a
                  circle of French or English soldiers. I felt that there was no other token of
                  decay so impressive as that bed of weeds in the place of the back-log.</p>
               <p>Here I sat, with those roofless walls about me, the clear sky over my head, and
                  the afternoon sunshine falling gently bright through the window-frames and
                  doorway. I heard the tinkling of a cow-bell, the twittering of birds, and the
                  pleasant hum of insects. Once a gay butterfly, with four gold-speckled wings, came
                  and fluttered about my head, then flew up and lighted on the highest tuft of
                  yellow flowers, and at last took wing across the lake. Next a bee buzzed through
                  the sunshine, and found much sweetness among the weeds. After watching him till he
                  went off to his distant hive, I closed my eyes on Ticonderoga in ruins, and cast a
                  dream-like glance over pictures of the past, and scenes of which this spot had
                  been the theatre.</p>
               <p>At first, my fancy saw only the stern hills, lonely lakes, and venerable woods.
                  Not a tree, since their seeds were first scattered over the infant soil, had felt
                  the axe, but had grown up and flourished through its long generation, had fallen
                  beneath the weight of years, been buried in green moss, and nourished the roots of
                  others as gigantic. Hark! A light paddle dips into the lake, a birch canoe glides
                  round the point, and an Indian chief has passed, painted and feather-crested,
                  armed with a bow of hickory, a stone tomahawk, and flint-headed arrows. But the
                  ripple had hardly vanished from the water, when a white flag caught the breeze,
                  over a castle in the wilderness, with frowning ramparts and a hundred cannon.
                  There stood a French chevalier, commandant of the fortress, paying court to a
                  copper-colored lady, the princess of the land, and winning her wild love by the
                  arts which had been successful with Parisian dames. A war-party of French and
                  Indians were issuing from the gate to lay waste some village of New England. Near
                  the fortress there was a group of dancers. The merry soldiers footing it with the
                  swart savage maids; deeper in the wood, some red men were growing frantic around a
                  keg of the fire-water; and elsewhere a Jesuit preached the faith of high
                  cathedrals beneath a canopy of forest boughs, and distributed crucifixes to be
                  worn beside English scalps.</p>
               <p>I tried to make a series of pictures from the old French war, when fleets were on
                  the lake and armies in the woods, and especially of Abercrombie's disastrous
                  repulse, where thousands of lives were utterly thrown away; but, being at a loss
                  how to order the battle, I chose an evening scene in the barracks, after the
                  fortress had surrendered to Sir Jeffrey Amherst. What an immense fire blazes on
                  that hearth, gleaming on swords, bayonets, and musket-barrels, and blending with
                  the hue of the scarlet coats till the whole barrack-room is quivering with ruddy
                  light! One soldier has thrown himself down to rest, after a deer-hunt, or perhaps
                  a long run<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6669-00000112"/> through the woods, with
                  Indians on his trail. Two stand up to wrestle, and are on the point of coming to
                  blows. A fifer plays a shrill accompaniment to a drummer's song,—a strain of light
                  love and bloody war, with a chorus thundered forth by twenty voices. Meantime, a
                  veteran in the corner is prosing about Dettingen and Fontenoye, and relates
                  camp-traditions of Marlborough's battles, till his pipe, having been roguishly
                  charged with gunpowder, makes a terrible explosion under his nose. And now they
                  all vanish in a puff of smoke from the chimney.</p>
               <p>I merely glanced at the ensuing twenty years, which glided peacefully over the
                  frontier fortress, till Ethan Allen's shout was heard, summoning it to surrender
                  "in the name of the great Jehovah and of the Continental Congress." Strange
                  allies! thought the British captain. Next came the hurried muster of the soldiers
                  of liberty, when the cannon of Burgoyne, pointing down upon their stronghold from
                  the brow of Mount Defiance, announced a new conqueror of Ticonderoga. No virgin
                  fortress, this! Forth rushed the motley throng from the barracks, one man wearing
                  the blue and buff of the Union, another the red coat of Britain, a third a
                  dragoon's jacket, and a fourth a cotton frock; here was a pair of leather
                  breeches, and striped trousers there; a grenadier's cap on one head, and a
                  broad-brimmed hat, with a tall feather, on the next; this fellow shouldering a
                  king's arm, that might throw a bullet to Crown Point, and his comrade a long
                  fowling-piece, admirable to shoot ducks on the lake. In the midst of the bustle,
                  when the fortress was all alive with its last warlike scene, the ringing of a bell
                  on the lake made me suddenly unclose my eyes, and behold only the gray and
                  weed-grown ruins. They were as peaceful in the sun as a warrior's grave.</p>
               <p>Hastening to the rampart, I perceived that the signal had been given by the
                  steamboat Franklin, which landed a passenger from Whitehall at the tavern, and
                  resumed its progress northward, to reach Canada the next morning. A sloop was
                  pursuing the same track; a little skiff had just crossed the ferry; while a scow,
                  laden with lumber, spread its huge square sail, and went up the lake. The whole
                  country was a cultivated farm. Within musket-shot of the ramparts lay the neat
                  villa of Mr. Pell, who, since the Revolution, has become proprietor of a spot for
                  which France, England and America, have so often struggled. How forcibly the lapse
                  of time and change of circumstances came home to my apprehension! Banner would
                  never wave again, nor cannon roar, nor blood be shed, nor trumpet stir up a
                  soldier's heart, in this old fort of Ticonderoga. Tall trees had grown upon its
                  ramparts, since the last garrison marched out, to return no more, or only at some
                  dreamer's summons, gliding from the twilight past to vanish among realities.</p>

               <p>THE following story, the simple and domestic incidents of which may be deemed
                  scarcely worth relating, after such a lapse of time, awakened some degree of
                  interest, a hundred years ago, in a principal seaport of the Bay Province. The
                  rainy twilight of an autumn day,—a parlor on the second floor of a small house,
                  plainly furnished, as beseemed the middling circumstances of its inhabitants, yet
                  decorated with little curiosities from beyond the sea, and a few delicate
                  specimens of Indian manufacture,—these are the only particulars to be premised in
                  regard to scene and season. Two young and comely women sat together by the
                  fireside, nursing their mutual and peculiar sorrows. They were the recent brides
                  of two brothers, a sailor and a landsman, and two successive days had brought
                  tidings of the death of each, by the chances of Canadian warfare, and the
                  tempestuous Atlantic. The universal sympathy excited by this bereavement drew
                  numerous condoling guests to the habitation of the widowed sisters. Several, among
                  whom was the minister, had remained till the verge of evening; when, one by one,
                  whispering many comfortable passages of Scripture, that were answered by more
                  abundant tears, they took their leave, and departed to their own happier homes.
                  The mourners, though not insensible to the kindness of their friends, had yearned
                  to be left alone. United, as they had been, by the relationship of the living, and
                  now more closely so by that of the dead, each felt as if whatever consolation her
                  grief admitted were to be found in the bosom of the other. They joined their
                  hearts, and wept together silently. But after an hour of such indulgence, one of
                  the sisters, all of whose emotions were influenced by her mild, quiet, yet not
                  feeble character, began to recollect the precepts of resignation and endurance
                  which piety had taught her, when she did not think to need them. Her misfortune,
                  besides, as earliest known, should earliest cease to interfere with her regular
                  course of duties; accordingly, having placed the table before the fire, and
                  arranged a frugal meal, she took the hand of her companion.</p>
               <p>"Come, dearest sister; you have eaten not a morsel to-day," she said. "Arise, I
                  pray you, and let us ask a blessing on that which is provided for us."</p>
               <p>Her sister-in-law was of a lively and irritable temperament, and the first pangs
                  of her sorrow had been expressed by shrieks and passionate lamentation. She now
                  shrunk from Mary's words, like a wounded sufferer from a hand that revives the
                  throb.</p>
               <p>"There is no blessing left for me, neither will I ask it!" cried Margaret, with a
                  fresh burst of tears. "Would it were His will that I might never taste food
                  more!"</p>
               <p>Yet she trembled at these rebellious expressions, almost as soon as they were
                  uttered, and, by degrees, Mary succeeded in bringing her sister's mind nearer to
                  the situation of her own. Time went on, and their usual hour of repose arrived.
                  The brothers and their brides, entering the married state with no more than the
                  slender means which then sanctioned such a step, had confederated<pb n="230-231"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000114"/> ated themselves in one household, with equal rights
                  to the parlor, and claiming exclusive privileges in two sleeping rooms contiguous
                  to it. Thither the widowed ones retired, after heaping ashes upon the dying embers
                  of their fire, and placing a lighted lamp upon the hearth. The doors of both
                  chambers were left open, so that a part of the interior of each, and the beds with
                  their unclosed curtains, were reciprocally visible. Sleep did not steal upon the
                  sisters at one and the same time. Mary experienced the effect often consequent
                  upon grief quietly borne, and soon sunk into temporary forgetfulness, while
                  Margaret became more disturbed and feverish, in proportion as the night advanced
                  with its deepest and stillest hours. She lay listening to the drops of rain, that
                  came down in monotonous succession, unswayed by a breath of wind; and a nervous
                  impulse continually caused her to lift her head from the pillow, and gaze into
                  Mary's chamber and the intermediate apartment. The cold light of the lamp threw
                  the shadows of the furniture up against the wall, stamping them immovably there,
                  except when they were shaken by a sudden flicker of the flame. Two vacant
                  arm-chairs were in their old positions on opposite sides of the hearth, where the
                  brothers had been wont to sit in young and laughing dignity, as heads of families;
                  two humbler seats were near them, the true thrones of that little empire, where
                  Mary and herself had exercised in love a power that love had won. The cheerful
                  radiance of the fire had shone upon the happy circle, and the dead glimmer of the
                  lamp might have befitted their reünion now. While Margaret groaned in bitterness,
                  she heard a knock at the street-door.</p>
               <p>"How would my heart have leapt at that sound but yesterday!" thought she,
                  remembering the anxiety with which she had long awaited tidings from her husband.
                  "I care not for it now; let them begone, for I will not arise."</p>
               <p>But even while a sort of childish fretfulness made her thus resolve, she was
                  breathing hurriedly, and straining her ears to catch a repetition of the summons.
                  It is difficult to be convinced of the death of one whom we have deemed another
                  self. The knocking was now renewed in slow and regular strokes, apparently given
                  with the soft end of a doubled fist, and was accompanied by words, faintly heard
                  through several thicknesses of wall. Margaret looked to her sister's chamber, and
                  beheld her still lying in the depths of sleep. She arose, placed her foot upon the
                  floor, and slightly arrayed herself, trembling between fear and eagerness as she
                  did so.</p>
               <p>"Heaven help me!" sighed she. "I have nothing left to fear, and methinks I am ten
                  times more a coward than ever."</p>
               <p>Seizing the lamp from the hearth, she hastened to the window that overlooked the
                  street-door. It was a lattice, turning upon hinges; and having thrown it back, she
                  stretched her head a little way into the moist atmosphere. A lantern was reddening
                  the front of the house, and melting its light in the neighboring puddles, while a
                  deluge of darkness overwhelmed every other object. As the window grated on its
                  hinges, a man in a broad-brimmed hat and blanket-coat stepped from under the
                  shelter of the projecting story, and looked upward to<pb n="232-233"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000115"/> discover whom his application had aroused. Margaret
                  knew him as a friendly innkeeper of the town.</p>
               <p>"What would you have, Goodman Parker?" cried the widow.</p>
               <p>"Lack-a-day, is it you, Mistress Margaret?" replied the innkeeper. "I was afraid
                  it might be your sister Mary; for I hate to see a young woman in trouble, when I
                  haven't a word of comfort to whisper her."</p>
               <p>"For Heaven's sake, what news do you bring?" screamed Margaret.</p>
               <p>"Why, there has been an express through the town within this half-hour," said
                  Goodman Parker, "travelling from the eastern jurisdiction with letters from the
                  governor and council. He tarried at my house to refresh himself with a drop and a
                  morsel, and I asked him what tidings on the frontiers. He tells me we had the
                  better in the skirmish you wot of, and that thirteen men reported slain are well
                  and sound, and your husband among them. Besides, he is appointed of the escort to
                  bring the captivated Frenchers and Indians home to the province jail. I judged you
                  would n't mind being broke of your rest, and so I stepped over to tell you.
                  Good-night."</p>
               <p>So saying, the honest man departed; and his lantern gleamed along the street,
                  bringing to view indistinct shapes of things, and the fragments of a world, like
                  order glimmering through chaos, or memory roaming over the past. But Margaret
                  staid not to watch these picturesque effects. Joy flashed into her heart, and
                  lighted it up at once; and breathless, and with winged steps, she flew to the
                  bedside of her sister. She paused, however, at the door of the chamber, while a
                  thought of pain broke in upon her.</p>
               <p>"Poor Mary!" said she to herself. "Shall I waken her, to feel her sorrow sharpened
                  by my happiness? No; I will keep it within my own bosom till the morrow."</p>
               <p>She approached the bed, to discover if Mary's sleep were peaceful. Her face was
                  turned partly inward to the pillow, and had been hidden there to weep; but a look
                  of motionless contentment was now visible upon it, as if her heart, like a deep
                  lake, had grown calm because its dead had sunk down so far within. Happy is it,
                  and strange, that the lighter sorrows are those from which dreams are chiefly
                  fabricated. Margaret shrunk from disturbing her sister-in-law, and felt as if her
                  own better fortune had rendered her involuntarily unfaithful, and as if altered
                  and diminished affection must be the consequence of the disclosure she had to
                  make. With a sudden step, she turned away. But joy could not long be repressed,
                  even by circumstances that would have excited heavy grief at another moment. Her
                  mind was thronged with delightful thoughts, till sleep stole on, and transformed
                  them to visions, more delightful and more wild, like the breath of winter (but
                  what a cold comparison!) working fantastic tracery upon a window.</p>
               <p>When the night was far advanced, Mary awoke with a sudden start. A vivid dream had
                  latterly involved her in its unreal life, of which, however, she could only
                  remember that it had been broken in upon at the most interesting point. For a
                  little time, slumber hung about her like a morning mist, hindering her from
                  perceiving the distinct outline of her situation. She listened with imperfect
                  consciousness to two or three volleys of a rapid and eager knocking; and first she
                  deemed the noise a matter of course, like the breath she drew; next, it<pb
                     n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6669-00000116"/> appeared a thing in which she had no
                  concern; and lastly, she became aware that it was a summons necessary to be
                  obeyed. At the same moment, the pang of recollection darted into her mind; the
                  pall of sleep was thrown back from the face of grief; the dim light of the
                  chamber, and the objects therein revealed, had retained all her suspended ideas,
                  and restored them as soon as she unclosed her eyes. Again there was a quick peal
                  upon the street-door. Fearing that her sister would also be disturbed, Mary
                  wrapped herself in a cloak and hood, took the lamp from the hearth, and hastened
                  to the window. By some accident, it had been left unhasped, and yielded easily to
                  her hand.</p>
               <p>"Who's there?" asked Mary, trembling as she looked forth.</p>
               <p>The storm was over, and the moon was up; it shone upon broken clouds above, and
                  below upon houses black with moisture, and upon little lakes of the fallen rain,
                  curling into silver beneath the quick enchantment of a breeze. A young man in a
                  sailor's dress, wet as if he had come out of the depths of the sea, stood alone
                  under the window. Mary recognized him as one whose livelihood was gained by short
                  voyages along the coast; nor did she forget that, previous to her marriage, he had
                  been an unsuccessful wooer of her own.</p>
               <p>"What do you seek here, Stephen?" said she.</p>
               <p>"Cheer up, Mary, for I seek to comfort you," answered the rejected lover. "You
                  must know I got home not ten minutes ago, and the first thing my good mother told
                  me was the news about your husband. So, without saying a word to the old woman, I
                  clapped on my hat, and ran out of the house. I could n't have slept a wink before
                  speaking to you, Mary, for the sake of old times."</p>
               <p>"Stephen, I thought better of you!" exclaimed the widow, with gushing tears, and
                  preparing to close the lattice; for she was no whit inclined to imitate the first
                  wife of Zadig.</p>
               <p>"But stop, and hear my story out," cried the young sailor. "I tell you we spoke a
                  brig yesterday afternoon, bound in from Old England. And who do you think I saw
                  standing on deck, well and hearty, only a bit thinner than he was five months
                  ago?"</p>
               <p>Mary leaned from the window, but could not speak.</p>
               <p>"Why, it was your husband himself," continued the generous seaman. "He and three
                  others saved themselves on a spar, when the Blessing turned bottom upwards. The
                  brig will beat into the bay by daylight, with this wind, and you'll see him here
                  to-morrow. There's the comfort I bring you, Mary, and so goodnight."</p>
               <p>He hurried away, while Mary watched him with a doubt of waking reality, that
                  seemed stronger or weaker as he alternately entered the shade of the houses, or
                  emerged into the broad streaks of moonlight. Gradually, however, a blessed flood
                  of conviction swelled into her heart, in strength enough to overwhelm her, had its
                  increase been more abrupt. Her first impulse was to rouse her sister-in-law, and
                  communicate the new-born gladness. She opened the chamber-door, which had been
                  closed in the course of the night, though not latched, advanced to the bedside,
                  and was about to lay her hand upon the slumberer's shoulder. But then she
                  remembered that Margaret would awake to thoughts of death<pb n="236-237"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000117"/> and woe, rendered not the less bitter by their
                  contrast with her own felicity. She suffered the rays of the lamp to fall upon the
                  unconscious form of the bereaved one. Margaret lay in unquiet sleep, and the
                  drapery was displaced around her; her young cheek was rosy-tinted, and her lips
                  half opened in a vivid smile; an expression of joy, debarred its passage by her
                  sealed eyelids, struggled forth like incense from the whole countenance.</p>
               <p>"My poor sister! you will waken too soon from that happy dream," thought Mary.</p>
               <p>Before retiring, she set down the lamp, and endeavored to arrange the bed-clothes
                  so that the chill air might not do harm to the feverish slumberer. But her hand
                  trembled against Margaret's neck, a tear also fell upon her cheek, and she
                  suddenly awoke.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>LITTLE DAFFYDOWNDILLY.</head>
               <p>DAFFYDOWNDILLY was so called because in his nature he resembled a flower, and
                  loved to do only what was beautiful and agreeable, and took no delight in labor of
                  any kind. But, while Daffydowndilly was yet a little boy, his mother sent him away
                  from his pleasant home, and put him under the care of a very strict schoolmaster,
                  who went by the name of Mr. Toil. Those who knew him best affirmed that this Mr.
                  Toil was a very worthy character; and that he had done more good, both to children
                  and grown people, than anybody else in the world. Certainly he had lived long
                  enough to do a great deal of good; for, if all stories be true, he had dwelt upon
                  earth ever since Adam was driven from the garden of Eden.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Toil had a severe and ugly countenance, especially for such
                  little boys or big men as were inclined to be idle; his voice, too, was harsh; and
                  all his ways and customs seemed very disagreeable to our friend Daffydowndilly.
                  The whole day long, this terrible old schoolmaster sat at his desk overlooking the
                  scholars, or stalked about the school-room with a certain awful birch rod in his
                  hand. Now came a rap over the shoulders of a boy whom Mr. Toil had caught at play;
                  now he punished a whole class who were behindhand with their lessons; and, in
                  short, unless a lad chose to attend<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6669-00000118"/>
                  quietly and constantly to his book, he had no chance of enjoying a quiet moment in
                  the school-room of Mr. Toil.</p>
               <p>"This will never do for me," thought Daffydowndilly.</p>
               <p>Now, the whole of Daffydowndilly's life had hitherto been passed with his dear
                  mother, who had a much sweeter face than old Mr. Toil, and who had always been
                  very indulgent to her little boy. No wonder, therefore, that poor Daffydowndilly
                  found it a woful change, to be sent away from the good lady's side, and put under
                  the care of this ugly-visaged schoolmaster, who never gave him any apples or
                  cakes, and seemed to think that little boys were created only to get lessons.</p>
               <p>"I can't bear it any longer," said Daffydowndilly to himself, when he had been at
                  school about a week. "I'll run away, and try to find my dear mother; and, at any
                  rate, I shall never find anybody half so disagreeable as this old Mr. Toil!"</p>
               <p>So, the very next morning, off started poor Daffydowndilly, and began his rambles
                  about the world, with only some bread and cheese for his breakfast, and very
                  little pocket-money to pay his expenses. But he had gone only a short distance,
                  when he overtook a man of grave and sedate appearance, who was trudging at a
                  moderate pace along the road.</p>
               <p>"Good-morning, my fine lad," said the stranger; and his voice seemed hard and
                  severe, but yet had a sort of kindness in it; "whence do you come so early, and
                  whither are you going?"</p>
               <p>Little Daffydowndilly was a boy of very ingenuous disposition, and had never been
                  known to tell a lie, in all his life. Nor did he tell one now. He hesitated a
                  moment or two, but finally confessed that he had run away from school, on account
                  of his great dislike to Mr. Toil; and that he was resolved to find some place in
                  the world where he should never see or hear of the old schoolmaster again.</p>
               <p>"O, very well, my little friend!" answered the stranger. "Then we will go
                  together; for I, likewise, have had a good deal to do with Mr. Toil, and should be
                  glad to find some place where he was never heard of."</p>
               <p>Our friend Daffydowndilly would have been better pleased with a companion of his
                  own age, with whom he might have gathered flowers along the roadside, or have
                  chased butterflies, or have done many other things to make the journey pleasant.
                  But he had wisdom enough to understand that he should get along through the world
                  much easier by having a man of experience to show him the way. So he accepted the
                  stranger's proposal, and they walked on very sociably together.</p>
               <p>They had not gone far, when the road passed by a field where some haymakers were
                  at work, mowing down the tall grass, and spreading it out in the sun to dry.
                  Daffydowndilly was delighted with the sweet smell of the new-mown grass, and
                  thought how much pleasanter it must be to make hay in the sunshine, under the blue
                  sky, and with the birds singing sweetly in the neighboring trees and bushes, than
                  to be shut up in a dismal school-room, learning lessons all day long, and
                  continually scolded by old Mr. Toil. But, in the midst of these thoughts, while he
                  was stopping to peep over<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6669-00000119"/> the stone
                  wall, he started back and caught hold of his companion's hand.</p>
               <p>"Quick, quick!" cried he. "Let us run away, or he will catch us!"</p>
               <p>"Who will catch us?" asked the stranger.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Toil, the old schoolmaster!" answered Daffydowndilly. "Don't you see him
                  amongst the haymakers?"</p>
               <p>And Daffydowndilly pointed to an elderly man, who seemed to be the owner of the
                  field, and the employer of the men at work there. He had stripped off his coat and
                  waistcoat, and was busily at work in his shirtsleeves. The drops of sweat stood
                  upon his brow; but he gave himself not a moment's rest, and kept crying out to the
                  haymakers to make hay while the sun shone. Now, strange to say, the figure and
                  features of this old farmer were precisely the same as those of old Mr. Toil, who,
                  at that very moment, must have been just entering his school-room.</p>
               <p>"Don't be afraid," said the stranger. "This is not Mr. Toil the schoolmaster, but
                  a brother of his, who was bred a farmer; and people say he is the most
                  disagreeable man of the two. However, he won't trouble you, unless you become a
                  laborer on the farm."</p>
               <p>Little Daffydowndilly believed what his companion said, but was very glad,
                  nevertheless, when they were out of sight of the old farmer, who bore such a
                  singular resemblance to Mr. Toil. The two travellers had gone but little further,
                  when they came to a spot where some carpenters were erecting a house.
                  Daffydowndilly begged his companion to stop a moment; for it was a very pretty
                  sight to see how neatly the carpenters did their work, with their broad-axes, and
                  saws, and planes, and hammers, shaping out the doors, and putting in the
                  window-sashes, and nailing on the clapboards; and he could not help thinking that
                  he should like to take a broad-axe, a saw, a plane, and a hammer, and build a
                  little house for himself. And then, when he should have a house of his own, old
                  Mr. Toil would never dare to molest him.</p>
               <p>But, just while he was delighting himself with this idea, little Daffydowndilly
                  beheld something that made him catch hold of his companion's hand, all in a
                  fright.</p>
               <p>"Make haste! Quick, quick!" cried he. "There he is again!"</p>
               <p>"Who?" asked the stranger, very quietly.</p>
               <p>"Old Mr. Toil," said Daffydowndilly, trembling. "There! he that is overseeing the
                  carpenters. 'T is my old schoolmaster, as sure as I'm alive!"</p>
               <p>The stranger cast his eyes where Daffydowndilly pointed his finger; and he saw an
                  elderly man, with a carpenter's rule and compasses in his hand. This person went
                  to and fro about the unfinished house, measuring pieces of timber, and marking out
                  the work that was to be done, and continually exhorting the other carpenters to be
                  diligent. And wherever he turned his hard and wrinkled visage, the men seemed to
                  feel that they had a task-master over them, and sawed, and hammered, and planed,
                  as if for dear life.</p>
               <p>"O, no! this is not Mr. Toil, the schoolmaster," said the stranger. "It is another
                  brother of his, who follows the trade of carpenter."</p>
               <p>"I am very glad to hear it," quoth Daffydowndilly;<pb n="242-243"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000120"/> "but, if you please, sir, I should like to get out
                  of his way as soon as possible."</p>
               <p>Then they went on a little further, and soon heard the sound of a drum and fife.
                  Daffydowndilly pricked up his ears at this, and besought his companion to hurry
                  forward, that they might not miss seeing the soldiers. Accordingly, they made what
                  haste they could, and soon met a company of soldiers, gayly dressed, with
                  beautiful feathers in their caps, and bright muskets on their shoulders. In front
                  marched two drummers and two fifers, beating on their drums and playing on their
                  fifes with might and main, and making such lively music that little Daffydowndilly
                  would gladly have followed them to the end of the world. And if he was only a
                  soldier, then, he said to himself, old Mr. Toil would never venture to look him in
                  the face.</p>
               <p>"Quick step! Forward march!" shouted a gruff voice.</p>
               <p>Little Daffydowndilly started, in great dismay; for this voice which had spoken to
                  the soldiers sounded precisely the same as that which he had heard every day in
                  Mr. Toil's school-room, out of Mr. Toil's own mouth. And, turning his eyes to the
                  captain of the company, what should he see but the very image of old Mr. Toil
                  himself, with a smart cap and feather on his head, a pair of gold epaulets on his
                  shoulders, a laced coat on his back, a purple sash round his waist, and a long
                  sword, instead of a birch rod, in his hand. And though he held his head so high,
                  and strutted like a turkey-cock, still he looked quite as ugly and disagreeable
                  greeable as when he was hearing lessons in the schoolroom.</p>
               <p>"This is certainly old Mr. Toil," said Daffydowndilly, in a trembling voice. "Let
                  us run away, for fear he should make us enlist in his company!"</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken again, my little friend," replied the stranger, very composedly.
                  "This is not Mr. Toil, the schoolmaster, but a brother of his, who has served in
                  the army all his life. People say he's a terribly severe fellow; but you and I
                  need not be afraid of him."</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said little Daffydowndilly, "but, if you please, sir, I don't want
                  to see the soldiers any more."</p>
               <p>So the child and the stranger resumed their journey; and, by and by, they came to
                  a house by the road-side, where a number of people were making merry. Young men
                  and rosy-cheeked girls, with smiles on their faces, were dancing to the sound of a
                  fiddle. It was the pleasantest sight that Daffydowndilly had yet met with, and it
                  comforted him for all his disappointments.</p>
               <p>"O, let us stop here," cried he to his companion; "for Mr. Toil will never dare to
                  show his face where there is a fiddler, and where people are dancing and making
                  merry. We shall be quite safe here!"</p>
               <p>But these last words died away upon Daffydowndilly's tongue; for, happening to
                  cast his eyes on the fiddler, whom should he behold again, but the likeness of Mr.
                  Toil, holding a fiddle-bow instead of a birch rod, and flourishing it with as much
                  ease and dexterity as if he had been a fiddler all his life! He had somewhat the
                  air of a Frenchman, but still looked exactly like the old schoolmaster; and
                  Daffydowndilly even fancied that he<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6669-00000121"/>
                  nodded and winked at him, and made signs for him to join in the dance.</p>
               <p>"O, dear me!" whispered he, turning pale. "It seems as if there was nobody but Mr.
                  Toil in the world. Who could have thought of his playing on a fiddle!"</p>
               <p>"This is not your old schoolmaster," observed the stranger, "but another brother
                  of his, who was bred in France, where he learned the profession of a fiddler. He
                  is ashamed of his family, and generally calls himself Monsieur le Plaisir; but his
                  real name is Toil, and those who have known him best think him still more
                  disagreeable than his brothers."</p>
               <p>"Pray let us go a little further," said Daffydowndilly. "I don't like the looks of
                  this fiddler, at all."</p>
               <p>Well, thus the stranger and little Daffydowndilly went wandering along the
                  highway, and in shady lanes, and through pleasant villages; and whithersoever they
                  went, behold! there was the image of old Mr. Toil. He stood like a scarecrow in
                  the corn-fields. If they entered a house, he sat in the parlor; if they peeped
                  into the kitchen, he was there. He made himself at home in every cottage, and
                  stole, under one disguise or another, into the most splendid mansions. Everywhere
                  there was sure to be somebody wearing the likeness of Mr. Toil, and who, as the
                  stranger affirmed, was one of the old schoolmaster's innumerable brethren.</p>
               <p>Little Daffydowndilly was almost tired to death, when he perceived some people
                  reclining lazily in a shady place, by the side of the road. The poor child
                  entreated his companion that they might sit down there, and take some repose.</p>
               <p>"Old Mr. Toil will never come here," said he; "for he hates to see people taking
                  their case."</p>
               <p>But, even while he spoke, Daffydowndilly's eyes fell upon a person who seemed the
                  laziest, and heaviest, and most torpid, of all those lazy, and heavy, and torpid
                  people, who had lain down to sleep in the shade. Who should it be, again, but the
                  very image of Mr. Toil!</p>
               <p>"There is a large family of these Toils," remarked the stranger. "This is another
                  of the old schoolmaster's brothers, who was bred in Italy, where he acquired very
                  idle habits, and goes by the name of Signor Far Niente. He pretends to lead an
                  easy life, but is really the most miserable fellow in the family."</p>
               <p>"O, take me back!—take me back!" cried poor little Daffydowndilly, bursting into
                  tears. "If there is nothing but Toil all the world over, I may just as well go
                  back to the schoolhouse!"</p>
               <p>"Yonder it is,—there is the schoolhouse!" said the stranger; for though he and
                  little Daffydowndilly had taken a great many steps, they had travelled in a
                  circle, instead of a straight line. "Come; we will go back to school
                  together."</p>
               <p>There was something in his companion's voice that little Daffydowndilly now
                  remembered; and it is strange that he had not remembered it sooner. Looking up
                  into his face, behold! there again was the likeness of old Mr. Toil; so that the
                  poor child had been in company with Toil all day, even while he was doing his best
                  to run away from him. Some people, to whom I have told little Daffydowndilly's
                  story, are of opinion that old Mr. Toil was a magician, and possessed the power of
                  multiplying himself into as many shapes as he saw fit.</p>
               <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6669-00000122"/>
               <p>Be this as it may, little Daffydowndilly had learned a good lesson, and from that
                  time forward was diligent at his task, because he knew that diligence is not a
                  whit more toilsome than sport or idleness. And when he became better acquainted
                  with Mr. Toil, he began to think that his ways were not so very disagreeable, and
                  that the old schoolmaster's smile of approbation made his face almost as pleasant
                  as even that of Daffydowndilly's mother.</p>

               <head>MAJOR MOLINEUX.</head>
               <p>AFTER the kings of Great Britain had assumed the right of appointing the colonial
                  governors, the measures of the latter seldom met with the ready and general
                  approbation which had been paid to those of their predecessors, under the original
                  charters. The people looked with most jealous scrutiny to the exercise of power
                  which did not emanate from themselves, and they usually rewarded their rulers with
                  slender gratitude for the compliances by which, in softening their instructions
                  from beyond the sea, they had incurred the reprehension of those who gave them.
                  The annals of Massachusetts Bay will inform us, that of six governors in the space
                  of about forty years from the surrender of the old charter, under James II., two
                  were imprisoned by a popular insurrection; a third, as Hutchinson inclines to
                  believe, was driven from the province by the whizzing of a musket-ball; a fourth,
                  in the opinion of the same historian, was hastened to his grave by continual
                  bickerings with the House of Representatives; and the remaining two, as well as
                  their successors, till the Revolution, were favored with few and brief intervals
                  of peaceful sway. The inferior members of the court party, in times of high
                  political excitement, led scarcely a more desirable life. These remarks may serve
                  as a preface to the following adventures, which chanced upon a summer night, not
                     far<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6669-00000123"/> from a hundred years ago. The
                  reader, in order to avoid a long and dry detail of colonial affairs, is requested
                  to dispense with an account of the train of circumstances that had caused much
                  temporary inflammation of the popular mind.</p>
               <p>It was near nine o'clock of a moonlight evening, when a boat crossed the ferry
                  with a single passenger, who had obtained his conveyance at that unusual hour by
                  the promise of an extra fare. While he stood on the landing place, searching in
                  either pocket for the means of fulfilling his agreement, the ferryman lifted a
                  lantern, by the aid of which, and the newly-risen moon, he took a very accurate
                  survey of the stranger's figure. He was a youth of barely eighteen years,
                  evidently country-bred, and now, as it should seem, upon his first visit to town.
                  He was clad in a coarse gray coat, well worn, but in excellent repair; his under
                  garments were durably constructed of leather, and fitted tight to a pair of
                  serviceable and well-shaped limbs; his stockings of blue yarn were the
                  incontrovertible work of a mother or a sister; and on his head was a
                  three-cornered hat, which in its better days had perhaps sheltered the graver brow
                  of the lad's father. Under his left arm was a heavy cudgel, formed of an oak
                  sapling, and retaining a part of the hardened root; and his equipment was
                  completed by a wallet, not so abundantly stocked as to incommode the vigorous
                  shoulders on which it hung. Brown, curly hair, well-shaped features, and bright,
                  cheerful eyes, were nature's gifts, and worth all that art could have done for his
                  adornment.</p>
               <p>The youth, one of whose names was Robin, finally drew from his pocket the half of
                  a little province bill of five shillings, which, in the depreciation of that sort
                  of currency, did but satisfy the ferryman's demand, with the surplus of a
                  sexangular piece of parchment, valued at three pence. He then walked forward into
                  the town, with as light a step as if his day's journey had not already exceeded
                  thirty miles, and with as eager an eye as if he were entering London city, instead
                  of the little metropolis of a New England colony. Before Robin had proceeded far,
                  however, it occurred to him that he knew not whither to direct his steps; so he
                  paused, and looked up and down the narrow street, scrutinizing the small and mean
                  wooden buildings that were scattered on either side.</p>
               <p>"This low hovel cannot be my kinsman's dwelling," thought he, "nor yonder old
                  house, where the moonlight enters at the broken casement; and truly I see none
                  hereabouts that might be worthy of him. It would have been wise to inquire my way
                  of the ferryman, and doubtless he would have gone with me, and earned a shilling
                  from the major for his pains. But the next man I meet will do as well."</p>
               <p>He resumed his walk, and was glad to perceive that the street now became wider,
                  and the houses more respectable in their appearance. He soon discerned a figure
                  moving on moderately in advance, and hastened his steps to overtake it. As Robin
                  drew night, he saw that the passenger was a man in years, with a full periwig of
                  gray hair, a wide-skirted coat of dark cloth, and silk stockings rolled above his
                  knees. He carried a long and polished cane, which he struck down perpendicularly
                  before him, at every step; and at regular intervals he uttered two successive
                  hems, of a peculiarly solemn<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6669-00000124"/> and
                  sepulchral intonation. Having made these observations, Robin laid hold of the
                  skirt of the old man's coat, just when the light from the open door and windows of
                  a barber's shop fell upon both their figures.</p>
               <p>"Good-evening to you, honored sir," said he, making a low bow, and still retaining
                  his hold of the skirt. "I pray you tell me whereabouts is the dwelling of my
                  kinsman, Major Molineux."</p>
               <p>The youth's question was uttered very loudly; and one of the barbers, whose razor
                  was descending on a well-soaped chin, and another who was dressing a Ramillies
                  wig, left their occupations, and came to the door. The citizen, in the mean time,
                  turned a long-favored countenance upon Robin, and answered him in a tone of
                  excessive anger and annoyance. His two sepulchral hems, however, broke into the
                  very centre of his rebuke, with most singular effect, like a thought of the cold
                  grave obtruding among wrathful passions.</p>
               <p>"Let go my garment, fellow! I tell you, I know not the man you speak of. What! I
                  have authority, I have—hem, hem—authority; and if this be the respect you show for
                  your betters, your feet shall be brought acquainted with the stocks by daylight,
                  to-morrow morning!"</p>
               <p>Robin released the old man's skirt, and hastened away, pursued by an ill-mannered
                  roar of laughter from the barber's shop. He was at first considerably surprised by
                  the result of his question, but, being a shrewd youth, soon thought himself able
                  to account for the mystery.</p>
               <p>"This is some country representative," was his conclusion, "who has never seen the
                  inside of my kinsman's door, and lacks the breeding to answer a stranger civilly.
                  The man is old, or verily—I might be tempted to turn back and smite him on the
                  nose. Ah, Robin, Robin! even the barber's boys laugh at you for choosing such a
                  guide! You will be wiser in time, friend Robin."</p>
               <p>He now became entangled in a succession of crooked and narrow streets, which
                  crossed each other, and meandered at no great distance from the water-side. The
                  smell of tar was obvious to his nostrils, the masts of vessels pierced the
                  moonlight above the tops of the buildings, and the numerous signs, which Robin
                  paused to read, informed him that he was near the centre of business. But the
                  streets were empty, the shops were closed, and lights were visible only in the
                  second stories of a few dwelling-houses. At length, on the corner of a narrow
                  lane, through which he was passing, he beheld the broad countenance of a British
                  hero swinging before the door of an inn, whence proceeded the voices of many
                  guests. The casement of one of the lower windows was thrown back, and a very thin
                  curtain permitted Robin to distinguish a party at supper, round a well-furnished
                  table. The fragrance of the good cheer steamed forth into the outer air, and the
                  youth could not fail to recollect that the last remnant of his travelling stock of
                  provision had yielded to his morning appetite, and that noon had found, and left
                  him, dinnerless.</p>
               <p>"O, that a parchment three-penny might give me a right to sit down at yonder
                  table!" said Robin, with a sigh. "But the major will make me welcome to the best
                  of his victuals; so I will even step boldly in, and inquire my way to his
                  dwelling."</p>
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6669-00000125"/>
               <p>He entered the tavern, and was guided by the murmur of voices, and the fumes of
                  tobacco, to the public room. It was a long and low apartment, with oaken walls,
                  grown dark in the continual smoke, and a floor, which was thickly sanded, but of
                  no immaculate purity. A number of persons—the larger part of whom appeared to be
                  mariners, or in some way connected with the sea—occupied the wooden benches, or
                  leather-bottomed chairs, conversing on various matters, and occasionally lending
                  their attention to some topic of general interest. Three or four little groups
                  were draining as many bowls of punch, which the West India trade had long since
                  made a familiar drink in the colony. Others, who had the appearance of men who
                  lived by regular and laborious handicraft, preferred the insulated bliss of an
                  unshared potation, and became more taciturn under its influence. Nearly all, in
                  short, evinced a predilection for the Good Creature in some of its various shapes,
                  for this is a vice to which, as Fast-day sermons of a hundred years ago will
                  testify, we have a long hereditary claim. The only guests to whom Robin's
                  sympathies inclined him were two or three sheepish countrymen, who were using the
                  inn somewhat after the fashion of a Turkish caravansary; they had gotten
                  themselves into the darkest corner of the room, and, heedless of the Nicotian
                  atmosphere, were supping on the bread of their own ovens, and the bacon cured in
                  their own chimney-smoke. But though Robin felt a sort of brotherhood with these
                  strangers, his eyes were attracted from them to a person who stood near the door,
                  holding whispered conversation with a group of ill-dressed associates. His
                  features were separately striking almost to grotesqueness, and the whole face left
                  a deep impression on the memory. The forehead bulged out into a double prominence,
                  with a vale between; the nose came boldly forth in an irregular curve, and its
                  bridge was of more than a finger's breadth; the eyebrows were deep and shaggy, and
                  the eyes glowed beneath them like fire in a cave.</p>
               <p>While Robin deliberated of whom to inquire respecting his kinsman's dwelling, he
                  was accosted by the innkeeper, a little man in a stained white apron, who had come
                  to pay his professional welcome to the stranger. Being in the second generation
                  from a French Protestant, he seemed to have inherited the courtesy of his parent
                  nation; but no variety of circumstances was ever known to change his voice from
                  the one shrill note in which he now addressed Robin.</p>
               <p>"From the country, I presume, sir?" said he, with a profound bow. "Beg leave to
                  congratulate you on your arrival, and trust you intend a long stay with us. Fine
                  town here, sir, beautiful buildings, and much that may interest a stranger. May I
                  hope for the honor of your commands in respect to supper?"</p>
               <p>"The man sees a family likeness! the rogue has guessed that I am related to the
                  major!" thought Robin, who had hitherto experienced little superfluous
                  civility.</p>
               <p>All eyes were now turned on the country lad, standing at the door, in his worn
                  three-cornered hat, gray coat, leather breeches, and blue yarn stockings, leaning
                  on an oaken cudgel, and bearing a wallet on his back.</p>
               <p>Robin replied to the courteous innkeeper, with such<pb n="254-255"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000126"/> an assumption of confidence as befitted the major's
                  relative. "My honest friend," he said, "I shall make it a point to patronize your
                  house on some occasion, when"—here he could not help lowering his voice—"when I
                  may have more than a parchment three-pence in my pocket. My present business,"
                  continued he, speaking with lofty confidence, "is merely to inquire my way to the
                  dwelling of my kinsman, Major Molineux."</p>
               <p>There was a sudden and general movement in the room, which Robin interpreted as
                  expressing the eagerness of each individual to become his guide. But the innkeeper
                  turned his eyes to a written paper on the wall, which he read, or seemed to read,
                  with occasional recurrences to the young man's figure.</p>
               <p>"What have we here?" said he, breaking his speech into little dry fragments.
                  "`Left the house of the subscriber, bounden servant, Hezekiah Mudge,—had on, when
                  he went away, gray coat, leather breeches, master's third-best hat. One pound
                  currency reward to whosoever shall lodge him in any jail of the province.' Better
                  trudge, boy, better trudge!"</p>
               <p>Robin had begun to draw his hand towards the lighter end of the oak cudgel, but a
                  strange hostility in every countenance induced him to relinquish his purpose of
                  breaking the courteous innkeeper's head. As he turned to leave the room, he
                  encountered a sneering glance from the bold-featured personage whom he had before
                  noticed; and no sooner was he beyond the door, than he heard a general laugh, in
                  which the innkeeper's voice might be distinguished, like the dropping of small
                  stones into a kettle.</p>
               <p>"Now, is it not strange," thought Robin, with his usual shrewdness, "is it not
                  strange, that the confession of an empty pocket should outweigh the name of my
                  kinsman, Major Molineux? O, if I had one of those grinning rascals in the woods,
                  where I and my oak sapling grew up together, I would teach him that my arm is
                  heavy, though my purse be light!"</p>
               <p>On turning the corner of the narrow lane, Robin found himself in a spacious
                  street, with an unbroken line of lofty houses on each side, and a steepled
                  building at the upper end, whence the ringing of a bell announced the hour of
                  nine. The light of the moon, and the lamps from the numerous shop windows,
                  discovered people promenading on the pavement, and amongst them Robin hoped to
                  recognize his hitherto inscrutable relative. The result of his former inquiries
                  made him unwilling to hazard another, in a scene of such publicity, and he
                  determined to walk slowly and silently up the street, thrusting his face close to
                  that of every elderly gentleman, in search of the major's lineaments. In his
                  progress, Robin encountered many gay and gallant figures. Embroidered garments of
                  showy colors, enormous periwigs, gold-laced hats, and silver-hilted swords, glided
                  past him, and dazzled his optics. Travelled youths, imitators of the European fine
                  gentlemen of the period, trod jauntily along, half-dancing to the fashionable
                  tunes which they hummed, and making poor Robin ashamed of his quiet and natural
                  gait. At length, after many pauses to examine the gorgeous display of goods in the
                  shop windows, and after suffering some rebukes for the impertinence of his
                  scrutiny into people's faces, the major's kinsman found himself near the steepled
                  building, still unsuccessful in his search. As yet, however<pb n="256-257"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000127"/> ever, he had seen only one side of the thronged
                  street; so Robin crossed, and continued the same sort of inquisition down the
                  opposite pavement, with stronger hopes than the philosopher seeking an honest man,
                  but with no better fortune. He had arrived about midway towards the lower end,
                  from which his course began, when he overheard the approach of some one, who
                  struck down a cane on the flag-stones at every step, uttering, at regular
                  intervals, two sepulchral hems.</p>
               <p>"Mercy on us!" quoth Robin, recognizing the sound.</p>
               <p>Turning a corner, which chanced to be close at his right hand, he hastened to
                  pursue his researches in some other part of the town. His patience now was wearing
                  low, and he seemed to feel more fatigue from his rambles since he crossed the
                  ferry, than from his journey of several days on the other side. Hunger also
                  pleaded loudly within him, and Robin began to balance the propriety of demanding,
                  violently, and with lifted cudgel, the necessary guidance from the first solitary
                  passenger whom he should meet. While a resolution to this effect was gaining
                  strength, he entered a street of mean appearance, on either side of which a row of
                  ill-built houses was straggling towards the harbor. The moonlight fell upon no
                  passenger along the whole extent, but in the third domicile which Robin passed
                  there was a half-opened door, and his keen glance detected a woman's garment
                  within.</p>
               <p>"My luck may be better here," said he to himself.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, he approached the door, and beheld it shut closer as he did so; yet
                  an open space remained, sufficing for the fair occupant to observe the stranger,
                  without a corresponding display on her part. All that Robin could discern was a
                  strip of scarlet petticoat, and the occasional sparkle of an eye, as if the
                  moonbeams were trembling on some bright thing.</p>
               <p>"Pretty mistress," for I may call her so with a good conscience, thought the
                  shrewd youth, since I know nothing to the contrary,—"my sweet pretty mistress,
                  will you be kind enough to tell me whereabouts I must seek the dwelling of my
                  kinsman, Major Molineux?"</p>
               <p>Robin's voice was plaintive and winning, and the female, seeing nothing to be
                  shunned in the handsome country youth, thrust open the door, and came forth into
                  the moonlight. She was a dainty little figure, with a white neck, round arms, and
                  a slender waist, at the extremity of which her scarlet petticoat jutted out over a
                  hoop, as if she were standing in a balloon. Moreover, her face was oval and
                  pretty, her hair dark beneath the little cap, and her bright eyes possessed a sly
                  freedom, which triumphed over those of Robin.</p>
               <p>"Major Molineux dwells here," said this fair woman.</p>
               <p>Now, her voice was the sweetest Robin had heard that night, the airy counterpart
                  of a stream of melted silver; yet he could not help doubting whether that sweet
                  voice spoke Gospel truth. He looked up and down the mean street, and then surveyed
                  the house before which they stood. It was a small, dark edifice of two stories,
                  the second of which projected over the lower floor; and the front apartment had
                  the aspect of a shop for petty commodities.</p>
               <p>"Now truly I am in luck," replied Robin, cunningly, "and so indeed is my kinsman,
                  the major, in having so pretty a housekeeper. But I prithee trouble him to step to
                  the door; I will deliver him a message from his friends<pb n="258-259"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000128"/> in the country, and then go back to my lodgings at
                  the inn."</p>
               <p>"Nay, the major has been a-bed this hour or more," said the lady of the scarlet
                  petticoat; "and it would be to little purpose to disturb him to-night, seeing his
                  evening draught was of the strongest. But he is a kind-hearted man, and it would
                  be as much as my life's worth to let a kinsman of his turn away from the door. You
                  are the good old gentleman's very picture, and I could swear that was his
                  rainy-weather hat. Also he has garments very much resembling those leather
                  small-clothes. But come in, I pray, for I bid you hearty welcome in his name."</p>
               <p>So saying, the fair and hospitable dame took our hero by the hand; and the touch
                  was light, and the force was gentleness, and though Robin read in her eyes what he
                  did not hear in her words, yet the slender-waisted woman in the scarlet petticoat
                  proved stronger than the athletic country youth. She had drawn his half-willing
                  footsteps nearly to the threshold, when the opening of a door in the neighborhood
                  startled the major's house-keeper, and, leaving the major's kinsman, she vanished
                  speedily into her own domicile. A heavy yawn preceded the appearance of a man,
                  who, like the Moonshine of Pyramus and Thisbe, carried a lantern, needlessly
                  aiding his sister luminary in the heavens. As he walked sleepily up the street, he
                  turned his broad, dull face on Robin, and displayed a long staff, spiked at the
                  end.</p>
               <p>"Home, vagabond, home!" said the watchman, in accents that seemed to fall asleep
                  as soon as they were uttered. "Home, or we'll set you in the stocks, by peep of
                  day!"</p>
               <p>"This is the second hint of the kind," thought Robin. "I wish they would end my
                  difficulties, by setting me there to-night."</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, the youth felt an instinctive antipathy towards the guardian of
                  midnight order, which at first prevented him from asking his usual question. But
                  just when the man was about to vanish behind the corner, Robin resolved not to
                  lose the opportunity, and shouted lustily after him,—</p>
               <p>"I say, friend! will you guide me to the house of my kinsman, Major Molineux?"</p>
               <p>The watchman made no reply, but turned the corner and was gone; yet Robin seemed
                  to hear the sound of drowsy laughter stealing along the solitary street. At that
                  moment, also, a pleasant titter saluted him from the open window above his head;
                  he looked up, and caught the sparkle of a saucy eye; a round arm beckoned to him,
                  and next he heard light footsteps descending the staircase within. But Robin,
                  being of the household of a New England clergyman, was a good youth, as well as a
                  shrewd one; so he resisted temptation, and fled away.</p>
               <p>He now roamed desperately, and at random, through the town, almost ready to
                  believe that a spell was on him, like that by which a wizard of his country had
                  once kept three pursuers wandering, a whole winter night, within twenty paces of
                  the cottage which they sought. The streets lay before him, strange and desolate,
                  and the lights were extinguished in almost every house. Twice, however, little
                  parties of men, among whom Robin distinguished individuals in outlandish attire,
                  came hurrying along; but though on both occasions they paused to<pb n="260-261"
                     xml:id="VAC6669-00000129"/> address him, such intercourse did not at all
                  enlighten his perplexity. They did but utter a few words in some language of which
                  Robin knew nothing, and perceiving his inability to answer, bestowed a curse upon
                  him in plain English, and hastened away. Finally, the lad determined to knock at
                  the door of every mansion that might appear worthy to be occupied by his kinsman,
                  trusting that perseverance would overcome the fatality that had hitherto thwarted
                  him. Firm in this resolve, he was passing beneath the walls of a church, which
                  formed the corner of two streets, when, as he turned into the shade of its
                  steeple, he encountered a bulky stranger, muffled in a cloak. The man was
                  proceeding with the speed of earnest business, but Robin planted himself full
                  before him, holding the oak cudgel with both hands across his body, as a bar to
                  further passage.</p>
               <p>"Halt, honest man, and answer me a question," said he, very resolutely. "Tell me,
                  this instant, whereabouts is the dwelling of my kinsman, Major Molineux!"</p>
               <p>"Keep your tongue between your teeth, fool, and let me pass!" said a deep, gruff
                  voice, which Robin partly remembered. "Let me pass, I say, or I'll strike you to
                  the earth!"</p>
               <p>"No, no, neighbor!" cried Robin, flourishing his cudgel, and then thrusting its
                  larger end close to the man's muffled face. "No, no, I'm not the fool you take me
                  for, nor do you pass till I have an answer to my question. Whereabouts is the
                  dwelling of my kinsman, Major Molineux?"</p>
               <p>The stranger, instead of attempting to force his passage, stepped back into the
                  moonlight, unmuffled his face, and stared full into that of Robin.</p>
               <p>"Watch here an hour, and Major Molineux will pass by," said he.</p>
               <p>Robin gazed with dismay and astonishment on the unprecedented physiognomy of the
                  speaker. The forehead with its double prominence, the broad hooked nose, the
                  shaggy eyebrows, and fiery eyes, were those which he had noticed at the inn, but
                  the man's complexion had undergone a singular, or, more properly, a two-fold
                  change. One side of the face blazed an intense red, while the other was black as
                  midnight, the division line being in the broad bridge of the nose; and a mouth
                  which seemed to extend from ear to ear was black or red, in contrast to the color
                  of the cheek. The effect was as if two individual devils, a fiend of fire and a
                  fiend of darkness, had united themselves to form this infernal visage. The
                  stranger grinned in Robin's face, muffled his parti-colored features, and was out
                  of sight in a moment.</p>
               <p>"Strange things we travellers see!" ejaculated Robin.</p>
               <p>He seated himself, however, upon the steps of the church-door, resolving to wait
                  the appointed time for his kinsman. A few moments were consumed in philosophical
                  speculations upon the species of man who had just left him; but having settled
                  this point shrewdly, rationally, and satisfactorily, he was compelled to look
                  elsewhere for his amusement. And first he threw his eyes along the street. It was
                  of more respectable appearance than most of those into which he had wandered, and
                  the moon, creating, like the imaginative power, a beautiful strangeness in
                  familiar objects, gave something of romance to a scene that might not have
                  possessed it in the light of day. The irregular and often quaint architecture<pb
                     n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6669-00000130"/> tecture of the houses, some of whose
                  roofs were broken into numerous little peaks, while others ascended, steep and
                  narrow, into a single point, and others again were square; the pure snow-white of
                  some of their complexions, the aged darkness of others, and the thousand
                  sparklings, reflected from bright substances in the walls of many; these matters
                  engaged Robin's attention for a while, and then began to grow wearisome. Next he
                  endeavored to define the forms of distant objects, starting away, with almost
                  ghostly indistinctness, just as his eye appeared to grasp them; and finally he
                  took a minute survey of an edifice which stood on the opposite side of the street,
                  directly in front of the church-door, where he was stationed. It was a large,
                  square mansion, distinguished from its neighbors by a balcony, which rested on
                  tall pillars, and by an elaborate Gothic window, communicating therewith.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps this is the very house I have been seeking," thought Robin.</p>
               <p>Then he strove to speed away the time, by listening to a murmur which swept
                  continually along the street, yet was scarcely audible, except to an unaccustomed
                  ear like his; it was a low, dull, dreamy sound, compounded of many noises, each of
                  which was at too great a distance to be separately heard. Robin marvelled at this
                  snore of a sleeping town, and marvelled more whenever its continuity was broken by
                  now and then a distant shout, apparently loud where it originated. But altogether
                  it was a sleep-inspiring sound, and, to shake off its drowsy influence, Robin
                  arose, and climbed a window-frame, that he might view the interior of the church.
                  There the moonbeams came trembling in, and fell down upon the deserted pews, and
                  extended along the quiet aisles. A fainter yet more awful radiance was hovering
                  around the pulpit, and one solitary ray had dared to rest upon the opened page of
                  the great Bible. Had nature, in that deep hour, become a worshipper in the house
                  which man had builded? Or was that heavenly light the visible sanctity of the
                  place,—visible because no earthly and impure feet were within the walls? The scene
                  made Robin's heart shiver with a sensation of loneliness stronger than he had ever
                  felt in the remotest depths of his native woods; so he turned away, and sat down
                  again before the door. There were graves around the church, and now an uneasy
                  thought obtruded into Robin's breast. What if the object of his search, which had
                  been so often and so strangely thwarted, were all the time mouldering in his
                  shroud? What if his kinsman should glide through yonder gate, and nod and smile to
                  him in dimly passing by?</p>
               <p>"O that any breathing thing were here with me!" said Robin.</p>
               <p>Recalling his thoughts from this uncomfortable track, he sent them over forest,
                  hill, and stream, and attempted to imagine how that evening of ambiguity and
                  weariness had been spent by his father's household. He pictured them assembled at
                  the door, beneath the tree, the great old tree, which had been spared for its huge
                  twisted trunk, and venerable shade, when a thousand leafy brethren fell. There, at
                  the going down of the summer sun, it was his father's custom to perform domestic
                  worship, that the neighbors might come and join with him like brothers of the
                  family, and that the wayfaring man might pause to drink at that fountain,<pb
                     n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6669-00000131"/> and keep his heart pure by freshening
                  the memory of home. Robin distinguished the seat of every individual of the little
                  audience; he saw the good man in the midst, holding the Scriptures in the golden
                  light that fell from the western clouds; he beheld him close the book, and all
                  rise up to pray. He heard the old thanksgivings for daily mercies, the old
                  supplications for their continuance, to which he had so often listened in
                  weariness, but which were now among his dear remembrances. He perceived the slight
                  inequality of his father's voice when he came to speak of the absent one; he noted
                  how his mother turned her face to the broad and knotted trunk; how his elder
                  brother scorned, because the beard was rough upon his upper lip, to permit his
                  features to be moved; how the younger sister drew down a low hanging branch before
                  her eyes; and how the little one of all, whose sports had hitherto broken the
                  decorum of the scene, understood the prayer for her playmate, and burst into
                  clamorous grief. Then he saw them go in at the door; and when Robin would have
                  entered also, the latch tinkled into its place, and he was excluded from his
                  home.</p>
               <p>"Am I here, or there?" cried Robin, starting; for all at once, when his thoughts
                  had become visible and audible in a dream, the long, wide, solitary street shone
                  out before him.</p>
               <p>He aroused himself, and endeavored to fix his attention steadily upon the large
                  edifice which he had surveyed before. But still his mind kept vibrating between
                  fancy and reality; by turns, the pillars of the balcony lengthened into the tall,
                  bare stems of pines, dwindled down to human figures, settled again into their true
                  shape and size, and then commenced a new succession of changes. For a single
                  moment, when he deemed himself awake, he could have sworn that a visage—one which
                  he seemed to remember, yet could not absolutely name as his kinsman's—was looking
                  towards him from the Gothic window. A deeper sleep wrestled with and nearly
                  overcame him, but fled at the sound of footsteps along the opposite pavement.
                  Robin rubbed his eyes, discerned a man passing at the foot of the balcony, and
                  addressed him in a loud, peevish, and lamentable cry.</p>
               <p>"Hallo, friend! must I wait here all night for my kinsman, Major Molineux?"</p>
               <p>The sleeping echoes awoke, and answered the voice; and the passenger, barely able
                  to discern a figure sitting in the oblique shade of the steeple, traversed the
                  street to obtain a nearer view. He was himself a gentleman in his prime, of open,
                  intelligent, cheerful, and altogether prepossessing countenance. Perceiving a
                  country youth, apparently homeless and without friends, he accosted him in a tone
                  of real kindness, which had become strange to Robin's ears.</p>
               <p>"Well, my good lad, why are you sitting here?" inquired he. "Can I be of service
                  to you in any way?"</p>
               <p>"I am afraid not, sir," replied Robin, despondingly; "yet I shall take it kindly,
                  if you 'll answer me a single question. I've been searching, half the night, for
                  one Major Molineux; now, sir, is there really such a person in these parts, or am
                  I dreaming?"</p>
               <p>"Major Molineux! The name is not altogether strange to me," said the gentleman,
                  smiling. "Have<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6669-00000132"/> you any objection to
                  telling me the nature of your business with him?"</p>
               <p>Then Robin briefly related that his father was a clergyman, settled on a small
                  salary, at a long distance back in the country, and that he and Major Molineux
                  were brothers' children. The major, having inherited riches, and acquired civil
                  and military rank, had visited his cousin, in great pomp, a year or two before;
                  had manifested much interest in Robin and an elder brother, and, being childless
                  himself, had thrown out hints respecting the future establishment of one of them
                  in life. The elder brother was destined to succeed to the farm which his father
                  cultivated in the interval of sacred duties; it was therefore determined that
                  Robin should profit by his kinsman's generous intentions, especially as he seemed
                  to be rather the favorite, and was thought to possess other necessary
                  endowments.</p>
               <p>"For I have the name of being a shrewd youth," observed Robin, in this part of his
                  story.</p>
               <p>"I doubt not you deserve it," replied his new friend, good-naturedly; "but pray
                  proceed."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, being nearly eighteen years old, and well-grown, as you see,"
                  continued Robin, drawing himself up to his full height, "I thought it high time to
                  begin the world. So my mother and sister put me in handsome trim, and my father
                  gave me half the remnant of his last year's salary, and five days ago I started
                  for this place, to pay the major a visit. But, would you believe it, sir! I
                  crossed the ferry a little after dark, and have yet found nobody that would show
                  me the way to his dwelling;—only, an hour or two since, I was told to wait here,
                  and Major Molineux would pass by."</p>
               <p>"Can you describe the man who told you this?" inquired the gentleman.</p>
               <p>"O, he was a very ill-favored fellow, sir," replied Robin, "with two great bumps
                  on his forehead, a hook nose, fiery eyes,—and, what struck me as the strangest,
                  his face was of two different colors. Do you happen to know such a man, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Not intimately," answered the stranger, "but I chanced to meet him a little time
                  previous to your stopping me. I believe you may trust his word, and that the major
                  will very shortly pass through this street. In the mean time, as I have a singular
                  curiosity to witness your meeting, I will sit down here upon the steps, and bear
                  you company."</p>
               <p>He seated himself accordingly, and soon engaged his companion in animated
                  discourse. It was but of brief continuance, however, for a noise of shouting,
                  which had long been remotely audible, drew so much nearer that Robin inquired its
                  cause.</p>
               <p>"What may be the meaning of this uproar?" asked he. "Truly, if your town be always
                  as noisy, I shall find little sleep, while I am an inhabitant."</p>
               <p>"Why, indeed, friend Robin, there do appear to be three or four riotous fellows
                  abroad to-night," replied the gentleman. "You must not expect all the stillness of
                  your native woods, here in our streets. But the watch will shortly be at the heels
                  of these lads, and—"</p>
               <p>"Ay, and set them in the stocks by peep of day," interrupted Robin, recollecting
                  his own encounter with the drowsy lantern-bearer. "But, dear sir, if I may trust
                  my ears, an army of watchmen would never make head against such a multitude of
                  rioters. There were<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6669-00000133"/> at least a thousand
                  voices went up to make that one shout."</p>
               <p>"May not a man have several voices, Robin, as well as two complexions?" said his
                  friend.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps a man may; but Heaven forbid that a woman should!" responded the shrewd
                  youth, thinking of the seductive tones of the major's housekeeper.</p>
               <p>The sounds of a trumpet in some neighboring street now became so evident and
                  continual, that Robin's curiosity was strongly excited. In addition to the shouts,
                  he heard frequent bursts from many instruments of discord, and a wild and confused
                  laughter filled up the intervals. Robin rose from the steps, and looked wistfully
                  towards a point whither several people seemed to be hastening.</p>
               <p>"Surely some prodigious merry-making is going on," exclaimed he. "I have laughed
                  very little since I left home, sir, and should be sorry to lose an opportunity.
                  Shall we step round the corner by that darkish house, and take our share of the
                  fun?"</p>
               <p>"Sit down again, sit down, good Robin," replied the gentleman, laying his hand on
                  the skirt of the gray coat. "You forget that we must wait here for your kinsman;
                  and there is reason to believe that he will pass by, in the course of a very few
                  moments."</p>
               <p>The near approach of the uproar had now disturbed the neighborhood; windows flew
                  open on all sides; and many heads, in the attire of the pillow, and confused by
                  sleep suddenly broken, were protruded to the gaze of whoever had leisure to
                  observe them. Eager voices hailed each other from house to house, all demanding
                  the explanation, which not a soul could give. Half-dressed dressed men hurried
                  towards the unknown commotion, stumbling as they went over the stone steps, that
                  thrust themselves into the narrow foot-walk. The shouts, the laughter, and the
                  tuneless bray, the antipodes of music, came onwards with increasing din, till
                  scattered individuals, and then denser bodies, began to appear round a corner at
                  the distance of a hundred yards.</p>
               <p>"Will you recognize your kinsman, if he passes in this crowd?" inquired the
                  gentleman.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I can't warrant it, sir; but I'll take my stand here, and keep a bright
                  look-out," answered Robin, descending to the outer edge of the pavement.</p>
               <p>A mighty stream of people now emptied into the street, and came rolling slowly
                  towards the church. A single horseman wheeled the corner in the midst of them, and
                  close behind him came a band of fearful wind-instruments, sending forth a fresher
                  discord, now that no intervening buildings kept it from the ear. Then a redder
                  light disturbed the moonbeams, and a dense multitude of torches shone along the
                  street, concealing, by their glare, whatever object they illuminated. The single
                  horseman, clad in a military dress, and bearing a drawn sword, rode onward as the
                  leader, and, by his fierce and variegated countenance, appeared like war
                  personified: the red of one cheek was an emblem of fire and sword; the blackness
                  of the other betokened the mourning that attends them. In his train were wild
                  figures in the Indian dress, and many fantastic shapes without a model, giving the
                  whole march a visionary air, as if a dream had broken forth from some feverish
                  brain, and were sweeping visibly through the midnight streets. A mass of people,
                  inactive, except as applauding<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6669-00000134"/>
                  spectators, hemmed the procession in; and several women ran along the side-walk,
                  piercing the confusion of heavier sounds with their shrill voices of mirth or
                  terror.</p>
               <p>'The double-faced fellow has his eye upon me," muttered Robin, with an indefinite
                  but an uncomfortable idea that he was himself to bear a part in the pageantry.</p>
               <p>The leader turned himself in the saddle, and fixed his glance full upon the
                  country youth, as the steed went slowly by. When Robin had freed his eyes from
                  those fiery ones, the musicians were passing before him, and the torches were
                  close at hand; but the unsteady brightness of the latter formed a veil which he
                  could not penetrate. The rattling of wheels over the stones sometimes found its
                  way to his ear, and confused traces of a human form appeared at intervals, and
                  then melted into the vivid light. A moment more, and the leader thundered a
                  command to halt: the trumpets vomited a horrid breath, and then held their peace;
                  the shouts and laughter of the people died away, and there remained only a
                  universal hum, allied to silence. Right before Robin's eyes was an uncovered cart.
                  There the torches blazed the brightest, there the moon shone out like day, and
                  there, in tar-and-feathery dignity, sat his kinsman, Major Molineux!</p>
               <p>He was an elderly man, of large and majestic person, and strong, square features,
                  betokening a steady soul; but steady as it was, his enemies had found means to
                  shake it. His face was pale as death, and far more ghastly; the broad forehead was
                  contracted in his agony, so that his eyebrows formed one grizzled line; his eyes
                  were red and wild, and the foam hung white upon his quivering ing lip. His whole
                  frame was agitated by a quick and continual tremor, which his pride strove to
                  quell, even in those circumstances of overwhelming humiliation. But perhaps the
                  bitterest pang of all was when his eyes met those of Robin; for he evidently knew
                  him on the instant, as the youth stood witnessing the foul disgrace of a head
                  grown gray in honor. They stared at each other in silence, and Robin's knees
                  shook, and his hair bristled, with a mixture of pity and terror. Soon, however, a
                  bewildering excitement began to seize upon his mind; the preceding adventures of
                  the night, the unexpected appearance of the crowd, the torches, the confused din
                  and the hush that followed, the spectre of his kinsman reviled by that great
                  multitude,—all this, and, more than all, a perception of tremendous ridicule in
                  the whole scene, affected him with a sort of mental inebriety. At that moment a
                  voice of sluggish merriment saluted Robin's ears; he turned instinctively, and
                  just behind the corner of the church stood the lantern-bearer, rubbing his eyes,
                  and drowsily enjoying the lad's amazement. Then he heard a peal of laughter like
                  the ringing of silvery bells; a woman twitched his arm, a saucy eye met his, and
                  he saw the lady of the scarlet petticoat. A sharp, dry cachinnation appealed to
                  his memory, and, standing on tiptoe in the crowd, with his white apron over his
                  head, he beheld the courteous little innkeeper. And lastly, there sailed over the
                  heads of the multitude a great, broad laugh, broken in the midst by two sepulchral
                  hems; thus, "Haw, haw, haw,—hem, hem,—haw, haw, haw, haw!"</p>
               <p>The sound proceeded from the balcony of the opposite edifice, and thither Robin
                  turned his eyes. In front of<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6669-00000135"/> the Gothic
                  window stood the old citizen, wrapped in a wide gown, his gray periwig exchanged
                  for a night-cap, which was thrust back from his forehead, and his silk stockings
                  hanging about his legs. He supported himself on his polished cane in a fit of
                  convulsive merriment, which manifested itself on his solemn old features like a
                  funny inscription on a tomb-stone. Then Robin seemed to hear the voices of the
                  barbers, of the guests of the inn, and of all who had made sport of him that
                  night. The contagion was spreading among the multitude, when, all at once, it
                  seized upon Robin, and he sent forth a shout of laughter that echoed through the
                  street;—every man shook his sides, every man emptied his lungs, but Robin's shout
                  was the loudest there. The cloud-spirits peeped from their silvery islands, as the
                  congregated mirth went roaring up the sky! The Man in the Moon heard the far
                  bellow; "Oho," quoth he, "the old earth is frolicksome to-night!"</p>
               <p>When there was a momentary calm in that tempestuous sea of sound, the leader gave
                  the sign, the procession resumed its march. On they went, like fiends that throng
                  in mockery around some dead potentate, mighty no more, but majestic still in his
                  agony. On they went, in counterfeited pomp, in senseless uproar, in frenzied
                  merriment, trampling all on an old man's heart. On swept the tumult, and left a
                  silent street behind.</p>
               <p>"Well, Robin, are you dreaming?" inquired the gentleman, laying his hand on the
                  youth's shoulder.</p>
               <p>Robin started, and withdrew his arm from the stone post to which he had
                  instinctively clung, as the living stream rolled by him. His cheek was somewhat
                  pale, and his eye not quite as lively as in the earlier part of the evening.</p>
               <p>"Will you be kind enough to show me the way to the ferry?" said he, after a
                  moment's pause.</p>
               <p>"You have, then, adopted a new subject of inquiry?" observed his companion, with a
                  smile.</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, sir," replied Robin, rather dryly. "Thanks to you, and to my other
                  friends, I have at last met my kinsman, and he will scarce desire to see my face
                  again. I begin to grow weary of a town life, sir. Will you show me the way to the
                  ferry?"</p>
               <p>"No, my good friend Robin,—not to-night, at least," said the gentleman. "Some few
                  days hence, if you wish it, I will speed you on your journey. Or, if you prefer to
                  remain with us, perhaps, as you are a shrewd youth, you may rise in the world
                  without the help of your kinsman, Major Molineux."</p>
