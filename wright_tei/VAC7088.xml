APPLETON AND COMPANY, in the Clerk's office of the District Court for the Southern District of New York.   CHESTNUT WOOD. oo  CHAPTER   I. NOT far from the spot so celebrated as having given birth to that beautiful "Legend of the Sleepy Hollow," lay nestled among high hills the little village of Hymeswold. It was settled by the Dutch early in the period of their occupation of the country, and seemed to the quiet, leisure-loving old burgomaster to be the spot where, notwithstanding Bible tes- timony, the garden of Eden must certainly have been loca- ted. There stretched out rich green fields, intersected by lines of thick woods, hemmed in on three sides byla mountain range, and on the fourth invitingly open to the warm sun of the south. For years it seemed fully to have imbibed the spirit of its owners, and in very truth to possess all the characteristics of an old Dutch family. Not a sound from the world without disturbed its repose. It laughed when the sky above sent down its cheerful smile full upon it, or it wept when the dark clouds hung over its high hill tops, and dropped one by one their weight of tears   &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7088-00000003"/> 4 CHESTNUT WOOD. upon its sympathizing bosom. Through the very centre of the town, free and unconfined, bubbling and babbling as in its mountain home; ran the little river of C . Not a wheel had it to turn even for the sawing of those old logs, which lay so invitingly upon its banks. Singular natural advantages the place offered for money- making. people; but more singular still, none had ever madrs their way there. ' Where the fathers were born, there we;'e born the grandsons, and side by side, in the still church-yard slept those of kin, even to the third and fourth generation. Hymeswold had its three public buildings,-its meeting- house, its school-house, and its tavern. The first had a pastor and his flock, a bell and a sexton. The school had its teacher and its pupils, its mischief and its idleness; and the tavern had its jolly old landlord, its bar, its whittled ale-benches, and the portrait of the round rubi- cund visages of the Dutchmen, who had smoked and drank beneath its hospitable roof, all smiling and nodding in a most welcoming manner from the one merry face which, painted on the sign-board, bore under it the name of the Rising Sun. Very few strangers, however, came to be warmed and cheer- ed by its beams, for although Hymeswold was not many miles distant from that Babel of a Gotham, whose restless, noisy, chaffering soul was ever seeking, and ever finding, new outlets for its busy, working energies, it had been so far for- gotten. jQuiet and peaceful as the Sleepy Hollow itself, it had hardly for years wakened sufficiently from its long nap, to be conscious that it had an existence, or really belonged to young and growing America. It was really, therefore, quite an event, when a carriage containing a gentleman and his servant stopped one morning at the Rising Sun. A little crowd of villagers began to gather immediately   around it, but the occupants both looked grave and forbid- ding, and answered the somewhat noisy welcome of the land- lord with only a few impatient words. The orders which they gave were brief and simple, the servant's equally so with the master's, and no means could be found by those, who stood gaping around, to gratify their curiosity. After breakfast they both walked away, and did not re- turn again until night, and on the following morning, at pre- cisely the same hour on which they had arrived, the carriage was again at the door, and they departed as quietly as they had come. Just a week from the day on which they left, a little, ac- tive but also silent man made his appearance, and it soon be- gan to be noised about, that he had come down from New- York to buy up the whole town of Hymeswold. If a mine of gold had opened suddenly, beneath the feet of the quiet villagers, they would not have been more completely bewil- dered. The patches of ground which year after year had yielded only potatoes, or at best sheaves of golden wheat, seem- ed now to be about to yield a golden harvest of another kind, and the little man in black as he walked around the different farms, carefully surveying them, if he had carried in his hand the magic wand, which turned to gold every thing it touched, would not have been looked upon with more veneration, or more effectually have aroused the slumbering spirit of cu- pidity. Hymeswold awoke quickly, like a man whose quiet after-dinner doze, is suddenly interrupted by feeling a strange hand attempting to meddle with his well-filled purse. Forget- ful of its old Dutch origin it became at once fairly American, must we say it, almost Yankee, and when it came to matters of dollirs and cents, showed itself as capable of driving a bargain as the little city-bred lawyer himself. But it was of no use. A small farm consisting of about seventy-five acres, six of which was covered by a, sheet of  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7088-00000004"/> 6         CHESTNUT WOOD. water, was all that was purchased, and for this, the full value to the tenth of a cent was strictly and honestly paid, but no more. The farm, too, was situated at some distance from the vil- lage, so that the common intercourse carried on between neighbors would be prevented, and the disappointed villagers were obliged to sink back into their former quiet life, with- out so much as the pleasure of relieving their vexation, by complaints agaiist the new comer; for his agent had taken special pains not to communicate any circumstances connect- ed with him, other than his name and present residence in New-York city. Did the gentleman intend to build a house? Did he in- tend to reside there throughout the year? What was his business? What was his property? Had he any family? How old might he be? These, and many other questions always received the same answer. "If you wish to know, I will give you his address and you may go to New-York and inquire of him. My business is only to buy a farm." But there was one active, energetic spirit in this same town of Hymeswold, of whose inquiries he could not be so easily rid. At the baptismal font, he certainly bore the re- spectable name of "Jeremiah Goldsmith," but it was proba- bly the only time in which he was called other than "Jerry," or, since he had grown to man's estate, "Jerry Goldsmith." He had made his appearance in the village, some five years before the date of this tale, bringing with him only a small bundle, which the landlady of the Rising Sun avers to this day, contained only one coarse shirt, and a pair of blue yarn stockings. "He had come," he said, "f from down east, and had a notion of settling there, to see if he couldn't make a living. He had learned the carpenter's trade, but could turn his hand to almost any honest calling."   CHESTNRT WOOD.         7 He was man of all works, would go out to haying in hay season. He wondered if that pretty little gal Ruth would have found any ears of corn to have gleaned after him if he had been Boaz. He would have bet a sixpence she wouldn't; he did his work thorough. "He could build houses, raise a barn, drive a plough, butcher an ox, make cider, graft trees, dig a ditch, shoe a horse, put a new tire on a wheel, or do farming, buying and selling in general or particular, cuter than any other man in all the States, and he didn't care who said to the contrary. The men might suit themselves by calling on him for just what they wanted, and for the women there was no end to the jobs he could do for them, only try him and see! He could cob- ble shoes, weld old iron, solder leaking tins, set up leaches for soap, churn butter, milk cows, make gardens. In short, live and work he would, so with leave or without, it matter- ed little to him, he settled down in Hymeswold." At first the inhabitants were a little shy of him, but they soon found that for once a Yankee was as good as his word, and Jerry's long, lank figure, with his bushy hea4 of light curling hair, his laughing blue eye, and his rathp delicate features might be seen every where, and about every thing that was to be done. It was not of the slightest consequence to Jerry how many, or how different were his engagements. He would make a dozen for as many things to be done all at the same time, and such was his imperturbable good nature, that no shaft of anger or of reproach for the eleven who were disappointed, could reach him. Many days in Jerry's life were like the one on which the news of the arrival of strangers in Hymeswold reached him. He had made, for that very morning, a variety and multiplicity of engagements, which would have completely confused a more sensitive conscience.  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7088-00000005"/> 8         CHESTNUT WOOD. He had told Squire Sampson that " he would come as sartain as he was alive and raise his new barn. He had promised Dr. Thomson to plough a piece of land,-Mrs. Simp- son to shake her parlor carpet,-Mrs. Arms to work in her garden, and a farmer to go down and clean out his well." His intention was to go to Mrs. Arms to work, and there he went, but for once he was destined not to escape scathless. While he was turning up the rich soil in large manful shovel- fuls, he saw the squire's white head looking over the gar- den fence. "Squire! good morning," said he with great gravity. "How is that barn of yourn coming on. Mighty nice it will be, and them 'ere gray colts are handsome enough to live in a parlor. We'll have it nice and snug for them agin cold weather, won't we, squire. Going to paint it?" "I think we will have it raised first!" said the squire smiling in spite of his displeasure. "What is your promise worth, Jerry?" "Well now, squire, I meant to come,xstain as the world, but you see Mrs. Arms, she is a widder you know, and it kind o' seemed as if I ought to attend to her first." The squire was said to have rather a penchant for the rich widow, and a noise at one of the window blinds warn- ed him, that he might as well accommodate his rebukes to gentle ears, so he only said: "I tell you what, Jerry, if you fail me to-morrow, I will send to Charlton for a man, and you may go whistle for the next job you want from me." "Squire, I am your man," said Jerry, and to his digging he went again, but not many spades full had he thrown up, when Mrs. Simpson's little Sally came running into the gar- den. With her little pug nose more elevated than ever, in a very decided tone she said:    CHESTNUT WOOD.         9 "My marm wishes me to say to you, Mr. Jerry Gold- smith, that all the yellow in her carpet has gone, and the red is going too, as fast as it can, and if you want to see her laid in spasmodic convulsions at your feet, you had better not collie." "Faded? you don't how!" said Jerry, letting his spade fall. "That 'ere was the prettiest carpet in all Hymeswold, and I. wouldn't have nothing happen to it now, nor your marm neither, for all the world. So you run and tell her I'll step in as I go home to dinner." Hardly had he disposed of her, when he took great pains not to see the doctor's sulky which stopped opposite him in the street. But the doctor without waiting for recognition called out: "Halloo there, you Jerry! You deserve to take my whole saddle-bag of medicines, vials and all, for keeping those oxen waiting. Why don't you come?" "Couldn't think of taking your medicine," said Jerry with a sly laugh, ' unless you pay well for it, and don't know about it then. Aint very fond of doctor stuff. 'Twas too bad, now wasn't it, that you couldn't get those steers. It's such a prime day for ploughing." "I have had them waiting there these two hours, Jerry; no getting off that way." "Got them?" repeated Jerry with a stare of surprise. "I heard the man was using them, and you couldn't have them no way. Why, I should have 'lotted on coming, if I had know'd it." On his way home, Jerry encountered the farmer soaking wet, from the water in his well. He was tired and cross, and vented both in no very gen- tle expressions on Jerry's head. "Be6n down there alone, all alone, Mr. Buntz 2 " said Jer- ry. i Why I should have thought it was as much as your 1*  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7088-00000006"/> 10         CHESTNUT WOOD. life was worth. I wouldn't have had you for nothing, if I had known of it." Another burst of angry words and Jerry escaped, but loitered as he came to the Rising Sun, to learn'what wonder- ful event could have drawn the little crowd together there. Many were ready to tell of the arrival of the strangers, and many more to offer a surmise as to their business, and who they might be. Jerry listened attentively to every word, and waited with much impatience for the denouement which afterwards took place. When he heard this, he said triumphantly to himself: "I am his man; nobody could suit me better, and I'll make him say afore he has done with me, nobody could suit hinp so well. For sartain my fortune is made, and I always somehow know'd sooner or later that it would be." Ah Jerry! that is all very well. But between you and the new comer, that rich Mr. Atherton from New-York, there yawns a wider gulf than money, or rank, or age can make. He has, as the world goes, a singular habit of speak- ing the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. He abhors even-the shadow of a falsehood. He can forgive and forget any thing better than the slightest deviation from the straight path of rectitude. He would sooner see you starve than employ you twice, if once, only once, Jerry, you failed in a tithe of what you had promised him; and you hold your words and promises so light, that it may fairly be ques- tioned whether to your moral sense there exists any distinc- tion between right and wrong, truth and falsehood.   CH APTER II. EARLY during the spring, after the purchase of Mr. erton's farm, at IIymeswold, there began to be indicati putting the land in order, and erecting a house upon it one time, a wagon containing some twelve stout, sobe: ing Irishmen, with axes and spades, and other nec working utensils, drove into town, and board was er for them at the '"Rising Sun." At another time two somely-dressed gentlemen, both of whom, the village: sure, must be Mr. Atherton, were seen walking lei around the grounds, and making great use of some large instruments, such as had never before been brought to I wold. This occupation lasted for many days, and the interest evinced in it by the villagers seemed rather to : than annoy the strangers. Their questions were ans for the most part, good-naturedly, though the amount formation given, was rather such as to suit the inclinai the giver than the seeker. Tree after tree, venerab] the weight of years, which hung heavy upon its branch felled. Here and there spots were cleared of different sit shapes, evidently adapted to some particular use, and a' on with a directness and unity that were quite a puzzle industrious but rather random working countrymen. i the most frequent visiters to the place was Jerry. I ' \ looked with eager eyes for an opening in which his s \  might be required, but so far in vain. Each man h  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7088-00000007"/> 12         CHESTNUT WOOD. assigned task, and besides this, there seemed to be really noth- ing to do. The two gentlemen soon put away the brass in- struments, and then walked leisurely around, with apparent- ly no occupation. Jerry contrived to put himself often in their way, and to address to them remarks, as irrelevant to the real wish of his heart, as if he were only an unconcerned spectator. He soon decided that neither of these was Mr. Atherton, and he had quite a fancy for going to head-quar- ters when he wished any thing. Fortunately for him, he had not to wait many weeks, for waiting was very irksome to his energetic nature, before- Mr. Atherton came. His keen eye at once recognized the master, and the very second morn- ing after his arrival, he started for the much-wished-for in- terview. He found Mr. Atherton walking up and down in the largest clearing, and approaching him, he raised, with an awkward but native politeness, the torn brim of his well worn straw hat. "A pleasant day, sir," he said, in a not very diffident toner "The day does very well," said Mr. Atherton, return- ing his bow with some ceremony, which seemed to say more than his words, "I don't know that it is any of your business how the day is." "A nice place you have of it here," returned Jerry, noth- ing abashed, " and mighty cheap you got it too, sir. That little man in black you sent down here, was a 'cute kind of a chap. I never seed any body that could drive a better bar- gain.- He understood matters and things any how you could fix it." "Better than some other people do, I should judge,"' said Mr. Atherton dryly. "You look like a working man; pray, have you nothing- to do? ' "I shouldn't, be surprised if I had," said Jerry with a comical laugh. "There are at least a dozen men waiting for me   CHESTNUT WOOD. now; all on 'em good pay too, besides some four or five that I 'spose I shouldn't get much of nothing for." '"I should think you had better go and attend to some of them," said Mr. Atherton, and walked away. This was new treatment for Jerry. He had never yet in his life been foiled in any thing he had really attempted to do, and so when he tried- to whistle as he saw Mr. Atherton dis- appearing behind the trees, he found it was not quite as na- tural as usual; the tune would not come. But this was only for a moment; he was fertile in expedient, and before Mr. Atherton had time to cross the spot where his men were busy at work, Jerry had taken a short cut and was there before him. As Mr. Atherton approached, he stood looking on at the blows of a strong Irishman who was felling a good sized tree. "Why don't you strike at it, fellar?" said he in a good- natured tone. "Faith an' I do," said the Irishman, coming down thick and-fast with blows that might have felled an ox. "Yes! but you keep pick, pick, pick at it," said Jerry, " as if you was afraid of it. Strike a blow man, and done with it!" The heavy axe fell with the strength of a giant, butl.-; blow was ill-directed, and accomplished little.  ?;;ib? Jerry laughed; the other workmen dropped their axes, and stood looking on; Mr. Atherton had approached, and also stood still. Now, thought Jerry-now or never, is my time. "Let me hove hold of your axe," he said; "I'll bring down that 'ere at two strokes, or I'll stand treat to the whole on ye, all around." "Give it to lim!-give it to him, Pat!" shouted the gang. "Let's see him do it." Pat handed the axe, and Jerry took it. " La!" said he,  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7088-00000008"/> "        CHESTNUT WOOD. as he shook it in his hand, " this 'ere thing a'nt worth a cent. Ha'nt none on ye, got a better one?" A dozen han- dles were turned toward him, in a moment. He took sev- eral, examined them carefully; run his finger over the glistening edge; and having satisfied himself with the one he held, walked up to the tree, and looked carefully at it. "Two blows, did I say; ' said he, as he finished his survey. "Two; well now, I guess it will take four-and them pretty confounded smart ones-to bring it down. It's four is it, boys?" "No-no-two-two is all!" they answered in a breath. "Come now! that's hard on a fellar," said Jerry look- ing around with an imploring look; "why Samson nor Goliah, nor any of them small men, couldn't have done it at two-say four, and be fair!" "Two! or the treat-" was his only answer. ' That's too bad," said Jerry-" never got so caught afore in my life, and never will agin, I say for't: why there aint one on you that could do it under a dozen good round blows, and now expect me to do it at two, taint fair, and I'll stick to it. Is it now, Mr. Atherton?" The face of the gentleman addressed had gradually re- laxed its grave, stern expression, and now he looked pleased in spite of himself, to see the vaunting Yankee so fairly caught, and he said: "Words cost less than work. Give Pat his axe again." "So you think," answered Jerry, "I ought to have four. Well, I thought you would, but these Paddies are terrible hard on treats; they would drink up in an hour more than I could earn in a month; so here's for it," and with the most comical of all winks at Mr. Atherton, he drew off, and in an instant the tree cracked and shivered beneath his axe. '"There!"said he, throwing it down as the bending and swaying of the limbs gave notice that the tree was about to   CHESTNUT WOOD. fall. "The second blow any of you may have. Pat hir is welcome to it if he wants it." Hardly had he fin' these words before it lay at their feet, and all saw thai second was needed only to sever some loose pieces of be Jerry laughed-so did they all-and Mr. Atherton "That was well done, my man! Have you a trade?" t I am jack at all trades," answered Jerry. And master-" began Mr. Atherton. "Yes, sir," said Jerry, interrupting him, " and m of none; but I am a larnt carpenter, and if you should any help about building that 'ere house of yourn, I sl like to work for you." "And what is your name?" "Jerry Goldsmith, fromn down east." "Yes, I knew that some time ago," said Mr. Athe smiling. "Well, if you understand work pretty well, pei I may employ you when I begin to build. Are you any I of an architect?" "Why, yes, sir," answered Jerry, "I shouldn't be prised if I was. I am almost any thing that is honest.' "But I mean," said Mr. Atherton, " do you under, planning and overseeing the erection of a building?" "I am just as handy at it," answered Jerry, " as a at a ball. That's my profession, sir! La! now, there b a house nor a barn been built about here this five year, I haven't had the planning, and for the matter of that, of the building on't. These Dutchmen," said he, low his voice, and approaching a little nearer Mr. Athe "don't kinder know how to use their hands as we Yai do. They seem to be sort of slow moulded, you knom and I can't find none on 'em that can drive a nail quite q ly enough to suit me. They are always at my heels o: elbows, when I am working along with them. Sometin makes me e'enamost swear."  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7088-00000009"/> 16         CHESTNUT. WOOD. Mr. Atherton smiled. "Well, Jerry," he said, come to me to-morrow, and I will have a little talk with you, and if you have as many jobs to do, as you said you had an hour ago, it is quite time you were about them." Jerry had now all he wished, and much more than he had dared to hope, after his first interview with Mr. Ather- ton, so 'he went to fulfil his promises in the best way he could. The next morning he was for once punctual to his engage- ment, and with an easy familiarity quite unknown to Mr, Atherton, during his city life, he entered his room with his hat on his head and seated himself. Mr. Atherton bent on him, for an instant, a look of dis- pleasure, but it was only for an instant. Quickly recovering himself, he said: "Well, Jerry, I see that among all your other accom- plishments, you have never learned your manners." "No, sir! I never went to a manners school in my life," answered Jerry. "I don't think there were many on 'em taught in the town where I had my broughten up." His face was perfectly sober. Mr. Atherton was puzzled to know whether he had understood him; therefore he said nothing more, but went immediately to business. A half hour served to put him completely in possession of the leading traits in Jerry's character, and he found that rightly tutored and used, he had hold of a piece of humanity of which he could make excellent capital, but this tutoring was more of an undertak- ing than even he dreamed. "Jerry," he said, as Jerry rose to go, "you are, I see, in the habit of promising just ten times more than you can perform. Now, man! the very first time I catch you lying to me in this way, is the very last time I shall employ you. Good morning." "Now! I say for't," said Jerry, as he closed the door   /I, ). a     CHESTNUT WOOD. after him, ' if that 'ere man ain't a sharper, then I don't know; why, I feel as if I had themylaguy nettles all over me. I had rather be put up to be fired at on muster day by the whole militia, than stand such a hauling over. Why, I am as used to lying as I am to breathing, and how a man's to stop all at once is as bad as it would be, to sew me up in a feather-bed, and then tell me to walk about. It seems as if I should burst. Whew!" and Jerry drew a very long breath by way of immediate relief. But there was no help for it now. Jerry, as well as Mr, Atherton, was cast upon the great ocean of life, and the waves had for years borne them ever nearer and yet nearer one an- other, and now, and here, the waters were to meet and min- gle, nor be again separated, until they reached the " voiceless shore."  Mr. Atherton was just commencing the declining years of life, but he had long since exhausted both its sorrows and its joys. Of a grave, stern and taciturn disposition, he had mingled with men, but had never been of them. His mind was strong and active, his principles were high toned, and consequently strict. He had expected and demanded much, he had found and received but little; therefore, when the hairs upon his head were growing silvered, a disappointed and rather morose man, he sought a solitary home, away from the bustle and noise of life, where, unknowing and unknown, he might spend what yet remained to him of his allotted time. He brought with him the resources of a self-cultivation per- severed in amid the more pressing claims of business, but that was all of enjoyment that he had garnered up for himself, during those long, long years that were now only with the past. His life was now without an object, almost without a wish. He had yet to try the experiment whether such an one is worthy the trouble needed for its preservation.   &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7088-00000010"/> CHAPTER    III. NEAR the borders of the lake which has been already men- tioned, as making a part of Mr. Atherton's farm, there stood a small brown hut. It had gone very much to decay. The bricks which formed the chimney had fallen away, one by one, as if tired of so long standing sentinels upon the decaying roof, or as if, faithful old friends that they had been, they felt the fire going out upon the hearth-stone, and could not abide the desolation that must follow. Loose shingles flap- ped to and fro, impatient also to be gone. They were mer- ciless and cared little for the cold and the winter stormns, they made way for to enter beneath them. Large cracks yawned in the sides. The door swung upon broken hinges, and the two small windows boasted scarcely a light of glass. Stiff brown paper, bundles of old rags, and one steeple-crowned hat, that looked as if it might have been found upon some of the famous battle-fields around Hymeswold, took their place. It was a perfect picture of desolation and decay, and yet it stood amid a scene of- life and beauty seldom surpassed. The glassy, sparkling lake lay mirrored out before it. The sky and the clouds curtained it above, and so faithfully did the waters reflect them that they seemed to carpet it beneath. The tall old forest trees twined and intertwined their brawny arms around and over it as if to guard it from all harm, the sloping banks spread their soft velvet grass on both sides, and here had lived through years of a, careless, easy life, old   CHESTNUT WOOD. Pomp and his wife Dinah. No children had they, and they wished for none. It was enough of earthly happiness, now that ;" old massa " was gone (he had been ae slave in early life), for Pomp to sit with his pipe in his mouth, through the long summer days, on that same green bank, and draw up, if he and the fish were both in the mood, those fine large pickerel, which formed his support, both for "home con- sumption and foreign trade," as he used to say. Pomp once read newspapers, before he lost his eyesight or his spectacles, it did not matter much which. Parties came often to fish with him in his boat upon the lake, and then, though his arma was now too powerless to lift the oar, he could guide to the best spots, and many a moment he whiled away with stories of olden time. Dinah kept a rich store of cakes and root beer, and the lake would have lost half its charm to its visitors had they missed the shining, happy face and good refreshments of the one, or the merry story and lucky fishing of the other; and so it came to pass that this beautiful little lake-this exqui- site masterpiece of Nature's handiwork-instead of having bestowed upon it some such poetical name as it richly deserv- ed, was christened for the old negro, "Pomp's Pond; " and never failed to suggest to the comnmonplace Dutch people of Hymeswold, not its own perfect self, but Pomp-with his red handkerchief tied tightly over his bald head and low fore- head, his wrinkled face and sharp black eye, and his little bent figure clad in red flannel shirt and blue homespun trow- sers; or Dinah, with her cap and short gown, white as the driven snow, and her short black petticoat, her clothes always whole and always clean. Old Pomp, at the time that Mr. Atherton purchased the lake, had passed away, and was almost forgotten; but Dinah who was many years his junior, still lived in the old hut, though every thing seemed to have gone to ruin but herself.   &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7088-00000011"/> Lao        CHESTNUT WOOD. She was beginning to feel the infirmities of age, and often in the poetical language so natural to her race, would say, in answer to inquiries about her situation, ' Ah; Missis! the feather was lost from Dinah's cap when old Pomp died." Many attempts had been made to remove her to tihe alins- house. It was feared that she would perish from cold and want during some of those winter storms, with which thile climate abounded, but she had resisted every effort. '"She had never," she said with much indignation, " done any crime; she was wicked enough, she knew; but God was mer- ciful, and for the- blessed Saviour's sake would forgive her. She could not go to prison, and a prison it surely would be to her. Oh, she would rather die, for the grave was not so dreary and desolate a place, and then, too, it would be only this poor, perishing, black body that would be laid there. Her soul would be with old Pomp and her Saviour, singing --singing-never weary, with the sparkling crown and the golden harp," and sol;the old creature would talk on, until those who came to persuade her, went away themselves per- suaded that whatever little might remain to Dinah of earthly comfort here, there was laid up for her rest and plenty in heaven. Matters, however, now seemed to have approached a crisis. The old hut had been sold to Mr. Atherton with the land, and an early notice had been given to Dinah, that she must find a new home, for it was too unsightly an object to be allowed to remain. This intelligence had been communi- cated by the little man in black, in the short business man- ner which marked all his proceedings. He hardly stopped to notice the poor black woman, as she dropped, like one who had received a death-blow, into the chair, from which she had risen so smilingly to welcome him ; and as he turned from the door he did not hear the half-smothered ejaculations of '"Oh God! oh my blessed Saviour! help! help poor Dinah!" He did not see-no one did but God-those bitter tears   X1      -      CHESTNUT WOOD. that rolled slowly down her furrowed cheeks. He walked happily away, for his business was easily- and thoroughly accomplished, nor ever dreamed that he had left behind hin a breaking heart. It would have mattered little if he had; a heart, to be of value to him, must be set in diamonds and clasped about with finest gold. After his departure, DDinah sat rocking herself in her old arm-chair back and forth with that short, energetic motion, which is so often found to be relief to overburdened feeling. Not a breath of the sale of t i  house had before reached her. She had sat with the cold creeping over her aged frame awd stiffening and filling with rheumatic pains all her joints. She had been hungry, with nothing to eat, and faint and weak, with nothing to relieve her. She had sat through storm and shine, through winter and summer, and borne and suffered much, but the old roof was over her head. There stood the chair in which Pomp had always sat; there in the little shelf made within the large fireplace, lay his pipe, as he him- self had lain it; it had never been disturbed since. There, upon -that round oaken table, was his Bible. Dinah had never learned to read, but it contained within its well-worn leather binding, all that was left to her of hope and comfort. Pomp had loved it too; and so carefully had she watched him as he spelt it slowly out to her, that now she could turn to each page that had upon it the words he used to love, and passing her finger slowly over tlhem, could repeat from a well-stored memory, those precious gifts of God to his poor ignorant chil- dren ; and now when between her and her final rest there could remain but a few short fleeting days, or at most years, she must leave them all, for the house was sold! Dinah ]:ert repeating these words to herself, in a low mnonotonous tone: "The house is sold-the house is sold-I anust go. God have mercy upon poor old Dinah!"Mechanically she sought her Bible; her finger rested as it was wont, upon the rubbed &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7088-00000012"/> -. g23- CHESTNUT WOOD. words, but her memory was confused, and from her lips came only the words, "C God have mercy on poor old Dinah!" Three weeks from the day that Mr. Athertowns agent made his first call upon her, he walked again to the lake to insure the house being demolished before it should meet his employer's eye. He had given orders to that effect, and to his astolnishment, as he approached it, he saw the blue smoke curling slowly up from its broken chimney. "The black nigger!" he said indignantly, "she shall tramp before night. I'll have no trifling in this way. I don't see what the men meant by leaving her here." ' Here, nigger!" said he, pushing the door rudely open, ( you let me find you here when the sun sets to-night, and I will burn the house over your head, and you in it. Do you hear? None of your tricks to me!" he continued, as Dinah, at once recognizing him, threw herself upon her knees before him. "Use your old trotters to take yourself away. I don't think you can do better." "Oh, Massa! i assa! for God's sake!" gasped Dinah. "Hold your tongue, you nigger you, and be off with your- self, if you know which side your bread is buttered. Don't let me catch you here at sundown; that is all." So saying, he turned quickly and walked away; but he had gone but a few steps from the house, when seeming to recollect something which he had forgotten, he returned. "Old woman," said he, in a little more gentle tone, " perhaps you can't walk and carry all your duds as far as you will want to go; so I shall send round a team to take you; be all ready; there is no such thing as waiting when I am about." Dinah had not yet risen from her knees. She remained in the same attitude and with the same expression of utter despair upon her countenance that she had when he had left; and in after years that cold, business man, or rather machine, could forget many things more easily, than he could that help-   CHESTNUT WOOD. less old negro. Many times, when his hand had been hard upon the poor, and he had ground out from them their last farthing, there would come before him in the still twilight, or that stiller midnight hour, not the image of those he had late- ly wronged, but that of the black Dinah, and her kneeling posture upon the hard floor. Dinah felt sure now that her time had come; that time so long the most dreaded of her life, when she must go to the alms-house. She had no preparation to make; she had neither the heart nor the ability for it, and so, slowly rising from her knees, she seated herself for the last time in her old chair, and sat listening, without being conscious of it, for the sound of the wheels that should convey her away for ever. Her lips moved constantly in prayer, and He, whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain, was present in that ruined negro hut, and into that poor old broken heart was pouring At streams of consolation, bright hopes of the happy home-- the new "house, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. " Toward night, the wagon was heard, rumbling down the broken and uneven road that led to the lake. It stopped before the door, and Jerry, who had been deputed for this task, but not informed of Dinah's unwillingness to go, put his good-natured face inside of the door and said: "Good arternoon Dinah! Come to gin you a ride." The old woman looked at him, but with such a strange, vacant ex- pression, that Jerry was frightened and stood still. "I Isay, Dinah! '-said he, beginning at length to suspect the real state of the case, "Don't you want to go along with me? This is a terrible lonely kind of a place. I wouldn't live here for nothing. You are a dropping all to pieces, and the first tight wind that canme wouldn't leave a beam a standing, then you would be bad on't you know, if you were here all alone." &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7088-00000013"/> 24        CHESTIUT WOOD. Dinah's face began to show a little more sign of intelli- gence, and Jerry saw, and eagerly pursued his advantage: "Come now! get on your bonnet, and tell me what I'm to take. You'll find things proper nice at that 'ere new house you are going to." Dinah shuddered. "So you won't want to take much. Here is this 'ere old chair, and this 'ere table, and the Bible; we won't leave Pomp's Bible will we, Dinah?" Dinah made a rapid motion to take it, and Jerry gave it to her. "There! hold tight on to it. I shouldn't be surprised if you had pulled out some of the leaves a read- ing it so much." Dinah clasped it closer, and opening her lips for the first time said, "God have mercy on poor Di. nah!" "There Dinah!" said Jerry soothingly, as he would have spoken to a suffering child, " don't go to taking on, 'cause that would eny jest kill me. Get your bonnet and we'll have the beautifullest ride you ever did take." "God have mercy on poor Dinah!" was his only answer. "Well, God will have mercy on ye, Dinah. And if they abuse ye up there where you are a going, He'll punish them, the terriblest you ever seed. I should not wonder, not a bit, now Dinah, if hle rained down fire and brimstone on 'em, and burnt 'em up, or opened the earth into a terrible great hole and swallowed 'em right up, and if lie don't 'tend to it, Di- nah, in proper time, you jest let Jerry know, and he will. You shall be seen to, and looked arter, that you may make your mind easy about. Fetch your bonnet now, Dinah, that is a good woman," and lifting up the old table, he deposited it in his wagon, and came back. Dinah had risen mechanically as she saw it leaving the house, and was following it, as he entered. "Stop, Dinah," said he. "Youha'nt got your bonnet."' Dinah turned back, and going to an old chest, drew from it a yellow and red shawl, probably Pomp's bridal present to   CHESTNUT WOOD.         25 her; throwing it over her head, she went again to the door. "Now, I say," said Jerry to himself, " if she don't make a picture, I never saw one. I don't believe the critter owns a bonnet, for come to think on't, she has not been out of the house, up to Hymeswold thee 'twenty year. Laful massy! what is to be done. ThePe an't no use making any bones about it, and the sooner it's over, bonnet or no bonnet, the better for her." But Jerry was not quite quick enough. No sooner had Dinah caught sight of the table in the wagon than her whole heart seemed to fail her. Rushing back into the house, she threw herself upon the floor and gave vent to her grief in sobs and groans, and ejaculations that went to Jer- ry's heart. He dropped the chair, and the changes his coun- tenance underwent, were very significant of his feelings. At first his large blue eyes were opened with the utmost aston- ishment. Then, as he began to comprehend what was taking place, the color filled his brown cheeks; and at the last out- burst from poor Dinah, the tears rushed into his eyes and fell down unheeded upon the floor. When Dinah ceased, he wiped them hastily from his cheeks with the back of his rough hands, and clearing his throat with a short guttural hem! as if he would at once subdue and conceal the emotion that was choking him, he said.: "Now Dinah! don't-don't-for pity's sake, don't." God forgive me! I am a poor sinful creature " said Dinah, suddenly rising calm and quiet. "I mistrust him and an't willing to venture Him, to do as He has a mind to with a poor old nigger; but it's awful hard, Massa Jerry." "It is hard, now I say Dinah, an't it?" said Jerry catch- ing at once the new cheerfulness with which she spoke. "And as true as my name is Jerry Goldsmith, you shan't stay an hour longer in that work 'ous, than I can find a nice comfort- 4 ale kind of a place for you. so don't take it no more to heart, .!!    2 r^i e        ;^ $  'sX*  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7088-00000014"/> --6b        CIti STlNUT 'Ar OO1). -no more than you can help it, you know what I mean Di- nah." The two went out, and Jerry lifted Dinah as carefully into the high wagon as if she had been his own aged mother, and in so doing he received that reward which never yet was known to fail, even to those who give the cup of cold water. When they reached the door of the alms-house, a crowd of men, women and children, were called together by the sound of the coming wheels. Dinah involuntarily hid her face in her hands; the dreadful image, which had haunted the latter years of her life, was now before her, and there in truth she was, surrounded by all the po'rty and sin which she so loathed. The boys commenced to bhout, as they saw who it was, and the gay covering she wore upon her head, in the place of a bonnet; but one angry look from Jerry, and the lifting up of his heavy whip, with a somewhat threat- ening attitude, hushed every sound from among them, and it was icot until Dinah commenced ascending the steps of the house, that any one accosted her. "Dinah Lovejoy," said a mild-looking old woman, as she approached Dinah, and took hold of her passive hand, "I am glad to see you,-better late than never. I have been faiting for you here ten year come next Christmas. That was the year after your old Pomp died, you know." "Yes, yes!"said Dinah, looking wildly around her, " on- ly let me go in." "Move away, good people," said Jerry with some au- thority in his voice, " and let us come in. We are in' a hurry.' " "Time an't dear here, Mr. Jerry Goldsmith," said an- other of the paupers. "We have a plenty of that article and some to spare, so, I imagine the old woman will find out be- fore she has done with us." Jerry had taken hold of Dinah's arm, and was drawing   CHESTNUT WOOD.         2'. her along, but he found himself continually stopped until Dinah looked bewildered and ready to fall; then pushing the paupers to the right and left without any more hesitation, he soon reached the door of Dinah's room, and entering, locked it after them. Nothing would have been more agreeable to Jerry's feel- ings than to have sat down and staid with Dinah,until she be- gan to be more at home ; but this he knew he could not do; so after a few moments spent in most voluble praise of every thing around her,-not one word of which did she seem to comprehend,-he went to the wagon, and returned bringing the table and chair. Dinah was standing just where he had left her. He drew her into the chair, and taking from her tight hold the Bible, spread it open to a well-worn page upon her knee. Mechanically her finger began to move, and her lips to repeat the verse: "When I am old and gray-headed, oh, then forsake me not. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff, they support me." "Now is my time," thought Jerry, "I will slip out when she is busy at that. There is nothing, somehow, seems to comfort her but the Bible, and every body knows it. There," continued he, as once more in his wagon, he turned his horse's head and jogged slowly away, " that is the hardest day's work I have done since I have been in Hymeswold, and I wouldn't do another like it, if Mr. Atherton would give me a fifty-dol- lar bill.

But, Jerry, those very tears are of infinitely more value to you than all the fifty-dollar bills the world can boast!

Jerry's faithfulness and energy were fast making him a favorite, and his originality and quaintness never fail- ed to amuse him. "How is this, Jerry!" he said, "I thought you had work enough for two men, in getting that lumber all piled, and here you are off riding before sundown."  "I got that done, sir," answered Jerry, " some hours ago, and Mr. Derby, that's your agent's name I suppose, sent me to do another job that he'll never catch me at again.' "And pray, what is that?" asked Mr. Atherton, in sur- prise. "Why, to move that poor old soul, black Dinah, from the house where she has lived these hundred year, for all I know; and she took on so, it was enough to kill a feller. I ain't Very tough at such jobs, Mr. Atherton," continued Jerry, half apologetically, " somehow I never could bear, even when I was a little boy, to break up robins' nests, and I have often left a hole full of pizen young sarpents alone, rather than see them chasing about so like mad, and seeming to feel so hurt about it too. I'm chicken-hearted, I know, my mother al- ways said I was, when I was at home, and I don't get none the better on't, the older I grow, as I see." ' But who is Dinah, and where did she live?" asked Mr. Atherton, without taking any notice of Jerry's self-condem- natory remarks. "She was Pomp's wife, and lived down by the pond," an- swered Jerry, " and her house is as old as the hills, and as rotten as dirt, for all that I know; still, it was like tearing out her eyes to take her away; it was as much home to her, as the best of ours is to us." ' Drive me down there, Jerry, and let me see what you are talking about," said Mr. Atherton, springing with a very light step, for one of his years, into the wagon. Jerry #pplied the whip in good earnest. He had a hap.   CHESTNUT WOOD.         29 / / py feeling, he could not tell why, at his heart. He felt al- mnost afraid that Mr. Atherton would change his mind, and ask to be put down before he could get him there, so he drove on jehu-like, nor tightened rein until they stopped before old Dinah's house. "Oh, miserable enough!" said Mr. Atherton, fvith strong feelings of disgust struglining in his voice. "How could the people of Hymeswold suffer a human being to live in such a place?" "They didn't want to have her, sir," answered Jerry, "and they did their best to get her to the alms-house; but she wouldn't go. She said if it would please God to take her to Heaven, she should love to depart, but she wasn't wicked enough to be put with so many bad people, land had rather starve or freeze here alone than live longer here." "What sort of a woman is she, Jerry?". "The very prayerfullest, Biblereadingest, Christianest sort of a woman you ever saw." "said Mr. Atherton, in a tone which seemed to imply that such traits were entirely at variance with his fa- vorite ideas of truthfulness. "Yes," said Jerry, quickly understanding the implica. tion, and there an't no hypocrite about her, either. You should have heard how she prayed, when she found she mustgo. Most persons would have been calling on Mr. Atherton, but she called only on God. I would rather stand a whole mi- litia on training day, than such prayers again, they seemed as if she felt so awful bad." Mr. Atherton surveyed the house with the greatest care and in silence; at length he said: "Jerry, Mr. Derby was right. This old shell must come down. It's liable to fall any day; but I will tell you what. You say you are a carpenter. Now, if you will go to work and build this cottage up again, in a masterly-nmaner--mind, 'It  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7088-00000016"/> 30         CHESTNUT WbpD. I say masterly manner-and get it done by next Christmas, which is nearly four months from now, I will pay you well for it, and that old Dinah may come back and live and die here, for all that I care." Jerry's face was perfectly radiant with happiness. Mr. Atherton wondered as he looked at him, that he had never noticed what a handsome man he was before, but he went on to put the finishing stroke to his proposition-a proposition intended after all, more as a trial to Jerry's character, than arising from any good will toward Dinah. "But, Jerry, I allow you to do this, with only one res- ervation. You, yourself, shall appoint the day, before Christ- mas, on which the house is to be finished, and in case of fail- ure it shall revert to me, and I will hold myself at liberty to let it to any one I please. Now, remember, this is as certain as the laws of the Medes and Persians. Do you know what those were, Jerry?" "No, sir," answered Jerry, laughing and scratching his head; " but I am inclined to think they must have been pret- ty tarnal strict, if they were any ,of 'em like your'n." "So you call me very strict, do you?" said Mr. Ather- ton, his own features relaxing into a smile. "Well, there is an old saying that a 'strict master makes a good servant,' and we shall soon see how it is in your case. You may begin here as soon as you are ready." "Well, now, if it wasn't for taking you home," said Jer- ry, looking from the deepening twilight to the house, "I would make a pitch into those old walls afore night. I feel something as Samson did (the reader has already seen that Jerry was fond of Scripture illustration, and in this showed his pure descent fromn Puritan ancestry), when he put his arms around them pillars in that whapping big meeting-house, you know sir, the onie it tells about in the Bible, and shook   CHESTNUT WOOD.         31 it down. It seems to me, if I could get hlold of a good sized beam, I could rattle it all down like hail." ' Take care, Jerry," said Mr. Atherton, " if that is the way you are going to work, that you are not covered up in the ruins, as that same Samson was." "No danger of that, sir " said Jerry, laughing, "'cause you see I have my eyes." Mr. Atherton insisted upon walking home, partly because he wished to give Jerry an opportunity to go immediately to work, and partly because the stillness of the evening, and the beauty of the woods, were tempting to him. There was something in these quiet interviews with nature, which were soothing and refreshing to his worn-out heart. They were to him all he had hoped when he decided to exchange for theim the bustle .and turmoil of a city life, and to-night he was in a frame of mind to be benefited by gentle influences, for he had done a double good. One, the provid- ing a home for the destitute, and the other and scarcely less important, affording to an honest, kind heart, an opportunity to do for others. And indeed it is very true, Mr. Atherton, that you might have spent years in endeavoring to instil into Jerry's pervert- ed mind a love of truth, and never have accomplished it with any thing like the certainty of success which will await you now. Place an object-a noble objqbt-before a man, and let it be necessary to obtain it, that lie must conquer faults, or triumph over weaknesses, ten to o#e, if the man is worth the saving, the work is done.  -  Mr. Atherton was philosopher enough both to see and feel this. i   &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7088-00000017"/> CHAPTER IV. JEnRY GOLDSMTH was not the only person who had been tempted from New England by the verdant fields and rich soil of the Dutch State. , Here and there, marked by its more orderly and efficient tillage, the farm of a Yankee might be singled out, and the individuals by whom it was owned were almost always sure to possess, in a marked degree, the sec- tional peculiarities of the part of the country from whence they came. It was, however, rather singular that where a family had emigrated, the energy and intellect belonged rather to the wife, than to the husband. The necessity for the remove had originated in his want of ability to support a growing family at home, and in her determination that they should not only live, but be, in Yankee parlance, ' well to do in the world." So, when Mrs. Wallace proposed to her hus- band that they should take all their worldly goods, their three boys included, and seek a new home where land was better and cheaper; no one was surprised to hear that he readily consented, nor that the first letters were dated from Charl- ton, then felt to be as far removed from New England as Ore- gon is now. But the new home rapidly grew to be much more comfortable, as well as lucrative, than the old; and at the time from which this tale dates, a pretty house, as little Dutch in its arrangements and appearance as possible, and a   CHESTNUT WOOD.         33 snug farm bought and nearly paid for, rewarded the enterprise of the settlers. A fourth boy, too, had come to assist in farming, when he should have grown to man's estate, and not within many hundred miles of the city of New-York lived a more contented and happy family. At the close of a raw November day, when they had been j keeping, in spite of the want of a governor's proclamation, a real New England thanksgiving; the family were assem- bled in the clean, warm, well-lighted kitchen, to conclude their festivities by a merry round of home games. Even the baby was kept by some preternatural influence, wide awake, and the three eldest boys were not only allowed, but encour- aged to be as noisy and as lawless as they could. Suddenly, Charles, the eldest child, a boy of eight years, held up his finger in a listening attitude, and said: "Hush! I thought I heard a noise!  i:  "I should think it not unlikely," was his mother's ready answer. "There certainly has been some. Do you hear it now?" Her meaning was obvious, for the children were all listen- ing, and as still as a detected mouse; so, with a merry laugh at his own imaginings, the plays recommenced, and Charles was the most noisy of them all, when Stopping again with an ex- pression of almost terror on his face, he said: "Mother, I did hear 'it: it was a strange noise, like a child crying."  "A child laughing, you had better have said, Charles; but Walter," addressing her husband, " do open the door and see; soetmes a lost cat will cry very much like a child, and even a cat shall not go without shelter, on thanksgiving night."  Mr. Wallace opened the outef door, and with the three boys who had closely followed him, put his head out into the chill night air. }           2 * X! , ,.  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7088-00000018"/> 34         CHESTNUT WOOD. It was black and tempestuous; the wind moaned and groaned through the leafless limbs of the trees, or took up the dry and withered leaves and tossed them to and fro, with that rustling, crackling sound at once so frosty and so desolate. But these were all that was to be heard, and it was far too dark to use any other sense but the ear; so with a shiver which almost approached to a shudder, Mr. Wallace returned to the warm room. But Charles was not satisfied; he could not enjoy his sports again, and without his spirit in them, they were rap- Idly becoming rather sleepy affairs; when once more, and now so distinctly that the whole party started to their feet, the sharp, shrill wail of a child, as if the cry was forced from it by agony, rang through the house. "The lantern! quickly, Walter,' said Mrs. Wallace, taking a candle in her hand, and opening the door; but the wind immnediately extinguished it, and without waiting for her husband's slower movement, she went out alone in the dark, calling in her kindest tones- "Who is here, and what is the matter?" She listened with every nerve strained, and heard the sound of little feet coming with short quick steps towards her, and a cry of joy, so unlike the other, that it assured her at once of the presence somewhere near her, of a living child.         / Kindly she called again, and reached her hands out, feel- ing for the child in the darkness. The child was evidently groping about, with the hope of finding her, for the two sud- denly met, and with true maternal instinct, she lifted the child in her arms. "Come, come quickly," said the child, struggling to get down. "Mamma is very sick." "And where is your mamma?' "I  will show you. Come." "Is it far?"   CHESTNUT WOOD.         35 ' Not very. I have been calling you, but could not go so far away from mamma as the house."      i "What is the matter with your mamma?" "I do not know; she sat down and said she could not go any farther to-night, and now she does not speak to me." iMr. Wrallace now made his appearance with the lantern, and the child quickly guided them to the spot where her mo- ther lay. "Give me the lantern, and tak4 her up, Walter. I said I would not refuse shelter to a strange cat to-night, much less will I to a poor young thing like this. Lift her up carefully, for she looks like a broken lily now." It was not necessary to tell the kind-hearted man to be gentle, for he had never been otherwise to the least of God's creatures, and now he raised the sick woman, as if she were indeed the broken lily she so much resembled. The child took hold of Mrs. Wallace's hand, and kept close by her mother's side until they reached the house, then darting forward, she put a chair by the stove, and with an impressive gesture seemed to entreat them to place her mo- ther there. "She is not well enough to sit there; we must put her on the bed and warm her first," said Mrs. Wallace, under- standing the gesture. "Open the door into my bedroom, Charles." The boy instantly obeyed, then drew himself away in a frightened manner to his brothers. Mrs. Wallace was an able nurse, and it was not long be- fore the unexpected visitor began to feel the benefit of her attentions.  She opened her eyes, and looked with a wild stare about her. "Here is your child," said Mrs. Wallace, lifting the little girl upon the side of the bed. ' Were you looking for her?"  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7088-00000019"/> 36         CHESTNUT WOOD.  "Mamma," said she, in a sweet ringing voice, "here I am.  The mother looked earnestly from her to Mrs. Wallace, and made an effort to raise her hand, but she had not suffi- cient strength, and the expression of intense pain which this sense of her weakness seemed to give her, Mrs. Wallace could never forget. "Do not try to speak," she said, "you are in a safe home, and every thing shall be done for you and your child; only keep still until you are better." The woman gazed intently in Mrs. Wallace's face for a moment, then closed her eyes, and lay with as little appear- ance of life as if the spirit had already passed away; and the child creeping near to her, nestled her head upon her arm, and in a few minutes, without having been either warmed or fed, was soundly asleep. Mrs. Wallace felt almost inclined to awaken her, as she lay there so still, she seemed to her a silent rebuke for inhospitality; but she was too much accus- tomed to children ever to venture to disturb a first nap, and so she quieted her conscience by redoubling her attentions to the mother. Throughout the whole night she sat patiently and kindly by her bedside, putting her finger gently upon her lips, whenever she attempted to speak, and giving her from time to time, such restoratives as her condition seemed to require. She noticed, however, with alarm that the sick woman showed no inclination to sleep, but looked steadily either at herself or at the sleeping child. "Shut your eyes and try to sleep," she said, as the striking of the kitchen clock warned her of the approach of morning. The woman shook her head feebly. "I know you feel weak," she continued, "but sleep will be better for you than all my medicine." k   CHESTNUT WOOD.         37 "But not than your kindness," said the sick woman, speaking for the first time. "Poor child! you look as if you had fared but hardly. Give yourself no uneasiness; I will take care of you now, and this little thing too. See! how sweetly she sleeps. She is a very beautiful child. What is her name?' "Sybil Thornton." "Sybil! why, what astrange name. Whom do you call her for?" "My mother." ' Is your mother living now?" "No, she died many years ago." Notwithstanding Mrs. Wallace's duly inherited Yankee curiosity, she could not find it ip her heart to continue her questions, for the same look of pain passed over the mother's face; so she contented herself with smoothing and turning the pillow, and putting back the masses of hair which fell over the emaciated face. When day broke, and the sound of children's voices gave her warning that the younger part :  of the family were about to make their appearance, she said, Have you any friends you would like to have me send for to-day?" "None-I am dying. Let me die here with you." -   "A young thing like you to talk of dying, with such a darling child to live for, too," said Mrs. Wallace, cheerfully. "If you would only go to sleep, you would be ready when -  you woke up for a nice, warm breakfast, and feel all the bet- ter for it, Come I will drop this curtain, and while I go to attend to the children, you do your best to sleep. There is nothing like trying in this world." A faint smile played over the sick womans features, and with an effort, almost convulsive, she closed her eyes. ;   "There! that is a good child," said Mrs. Wallace, speak- ing as she would have to her own baby. "I will look in by-  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7088-00000020"/> 38         CHESTNUT WOOD. and-by, and if you do not sleep, and wish any thing, only let me know." True to her promise, after the children were dressed, and breakfast prepared, Mrs. Wallace looked in. To her joy, she found the mother asleep, but the child awake, and stealing into the room, she lifted Sybil carefully up, and was intending to take her away, when putting her hands together in a most supplicating manner, she said, "Please, ma'am, let me stay here!" Yes, you shall come back when your mamma wakens; but see, she is asleep now, and if you should stir you might trouble her." ' I will not stir." "Well, then, you may come back, but now you must be hungry." ' I do not wish to eat." Sybil's mother moved slightly, as if the whispered words had disturbed her, and without waiting for further parley she carried the child into the kitchen, where her husband and four boys were already sitting around the breakfast table. Sybil hid her face upon Mrs. Wallace's shoulder, but the good lady whispered: "Don't be afraid, dear! I am 'going to carry you into the boys' room, and comb out those tangled curls. Do you know you have slept in your clothes all night?" The child made no reply, but submitted to the process of washing and re-dressing with such a sad, quiet face, that Mrs. Wallace felt inclined several times to wipe away the tears which gathered in her own eyes. "What a beautiful child!" she exclaimed involuntarily, as she arranged the last of her long golden curls. ' Charles's hair was always curly too, but his is black as a raven's, and never inclined to grow very long. What a contrast there will be between you! Come! let me see how you look to-   , - CHESTNUT WOOD.         39 gether :" so saying, she pushed opened the door, and led the little stranger out, to introduce her to her new friends. "i Let her sit by me," said Tommy, the third boy. I will take good care of her." Sybil turned her large wondering eyes from him to Mrs. Wallace, and said: "I should like to, if you please, ma'am." "Certainly, you may sit just where you fancy; any of the children will soon learn to love you, and you must love them too. They have no little sister." "Yes, ma'am," said Sybil, in the same unchildish tone, so unchildish, that it always fell painfully upon Mrs. Wal- lace's ear, accustomed to the free prattle of her own little ones. Throughout the breakfast she did her best to make the children acquainted, but Sybil turned her eyes from one to another, and looked so soberly, that no one of the boys ventured to speak to her. As soon as they left the table, she stole noiselessly to her mother's door, and raised the latch as carefully as Mrs. Wallace could have done herself. "What a droll little thing she is!" she said, the moment the child was out of hearing. "She is twice as old now as her mother; and take them both together, they are the queerest couple I ever saw. Who do you suppose they are, Walter? and where could they have dropped from on such a night as last night? The mother looks as tender, and as delicate, as if she had been born and bred a lady, and she speaks like one too. I don't see what it means?" "I have been thiinking about them pretty much all night," answered her husband; "but I supposed you would find out something, as you were to be alone with the lady." "I don't know but she would have told me more, but she was so sick, I did not like to have her talk much. Perhaps i :  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7088-00000021"/> 4Q         CHESTNUT WOOD.            !? she may tell me to-day. They did not have a bundle with them, did they?" "No; I went out the first thing this morning to see, and I had rather chme to the conclusion that the woman was in- sane, and had taken the child, and wandered away down here, from New-York." "Perhaps she did; but she is no more insane than I am. I asked her if I should send for her friends, and she said, ' No, she only wanted to stay here and die ;' so she must feel pretty badly about something." "Well, wife, if you will take my advice, you will take good care of her, and won't ask her many questions. If she is a lady, there may be something whichl e will not like to tell; and if she says she does not wish any one sent for, I don't see that that is at all of any importance, just now, only I hope you will be able to make that sad-looking child smile before she comes to the table again. She made even me feel badly; and as for Charles, the boy played with, but did not swallow, one mouthful of his breakfast; and when she was not looking at him, he seemed perfectly fascinated by that little tearful face of hers." ' He is almost as odd for a child as she is-and now you ' --: watch him, and see if his first effort to amuse her is not made by carrying a story-book to her."             : Mrs. Wallace was alarmed when she again entered the sick woman's room, to see what a change had taken place  : since she had left it; she knew immediately that the sleep 1 had been the short slumber which is so often the precursor ! of death, and stepping back into the kitchen, she begged her husband to bring the village physician without any delay.  : "Do you not feel so well?" she inquired, as she again entered. The lady shook her head, but could not speak. "Let me raise you, that you may have a little freer air." I   CHESTNUT WOOD.          41 Mrs. Wallace raised her as gently as she would a sick infant, and a grateful smile rewarded her; but the final struggle had begun, and long before the slow-moving country physi- cian had arrived, his patient was beyond all mortal aid. Mrs. Wallace performed the last rites for her, not with- out that natural regret with which we see any thing that is fair, pass away from earth. Carefully and kindly she raised the child to kiss the cold lips, and clasp her arms around the still form; then almost terrified by the wild shriek of grief, which was the first emo- tion that Sybil had evinced, she forced her away, and still holding her in her arms, seated herself in her rocking-chair, and began soothing her and rocking her, as if she were quiet- ing her own child.                   , 0 "Hush, darling, hush! do not sob so! There, rest your little head against my bosom; I will love you, and take care of you, as if I were your mother. Be still! be still, dear child! Your mamma never will be sick again. I hope she has gone to that other world where she will be so very happy. Do not cry any more. See! you make Charlie cry too; he does not like to have you feel so badly; and here is Edward spinning his new top. Only look there! bow it flies around t Can you spin it? Here, Eddy, bring it nearer, Sybil will love to see you by-and-by." ; The sobs of the child and the humming of the top were the only sounds heard for some time in the room. Eddy} I wnith laudable perseverance, turned it around and around, I only looking up now and then, to assure himself that his mother was approving what he did; and Sybil, with her face still hidden upon Mrs. Wallace's shoulder, seemed as if she must already have more than exhausted a child's fountain of i tears; yet still she wept on and on, and Mrs. Wallace sooth- ed and quieted in the same gentle tones. "Mother! said Charles, at last, springing up from the I  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7088-00000022"/> 42         CHESTNUT WOOD. book, which he had been apparently quietly reading, "if  - you will let me,/I will read a story aloud about that little Alice Marten, whose mamma every one was so sure went to - 'Get it, Charlie, we should all?,':"e to hear it." Charles brought the book, and drawing his chair nearer to Sybil than he had ever ventured before, he began to read aloud. Gradually the sobs ceased, and before the tale was half completed, the little hands were withdrawn from her face, and Sybil's swollen eyes were fixed intently upon the reader.  }is voice faltered several times as he read some touching sentence, and every time it did so, Sybil raised her- ;  self a little more from Mrs. Wallace's shoulder, and when the boy's voice became choked, and the tears stood upon his cheeks, Sybil slipped from his mother's lap, and seated her- self on the floor close by his side. When he ha finished she said quietly:  "IMay I see your little book?" With a sly look, le slipped down alsd6upon the floor, and holding the book towards her, said: "There is a picture of little Alice planting flowers upon her mamma's grave. When ! it confes summer, I have a beautiful white rose, we will go. . together and plant it, just so, for your mamnma will we not?" F "Yes," answered Sybil, quietly.        '    : "And we will find some moss, and some myrtles," con-  tinued Charles, "just as Alice did, and we will go often  there together, as she went with her little brother." "Yes," again answered the child. X "Now, I  will spin my top for you again,' said Eddy,  coming up, and commencing the operation immediately.    I 'See, here, don't it go nice?"          -    ; "I do not love your top; I  like the story better."   ; "Then I   will read you another," said Charles. "Come,  et us sit near the stove together, or you may be cold."   I *     'I X g   CHESTNUT WOOD.          43 The children went hand in hand to the warm fire, and Charles read another and longer story, to every word of which Sybil listened with the greatest avidity. M3rs. Wallace busied herself around the room, but watched nevertheless these children very narrowly. It had a strange, old look, to see them sitting, with such grave faces, poring over a book. She would much have preferred to see them on the floor with the other children, spinning the top ; but she took good care not to interrupt them, and seized the opportunity to do several little things about the dead body, which she did not wish to have attract the notice of Sybil. Curiosity concerning the singular event which had taken place, drew many of the inhabitants of Charlton to Mr. Wallace's house, but neither of the worthy couple were peo- ple who would have been naturally inclined to gratify them, even if they had been able, as now they certainly were not; so, with many hard, unjust, and almost merciless conjec- tures, they looked upon the face of the fair young corpse, and went away to wonder and conjecture still. A quiet, private funeral-all the expenses of which, with- out one word of murmuring, 1Mr. Wallace defrayed-was in due time attended; and when Mrs. Wallace led Sybil back to her house, she felt as if God had, in some miraculous way, sent the child to be a comfort to her and her family. She clasped the little hand closely in hers, and made to herself a solemn promise that she would indeed be Sybil's mother. She had clothed her in simple mourning, and as she took off her .bonnet, she could hardly forbear again exclaiming aloud, "' Oh, how beautiful you are ]" but she contented her- self with lifting her up, and kissing her over and over again. "God has certainly s6nt her," she said that night to her husband, when they were alone together. ' She looks more  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7088-00000023"/> CHESTNUT WOOD. -I like an angel than a ththing else, and has such strange, old ye ways about her. I do wish I knew her history." -) "Have you examined the clothes her mother left?"    ' "No, not all; but they were, I felt as I touched them  fine and nice, such as you would have expected a lady to wear, and so were the child's. I will go now, and see if she had a pocket in her dress; perhaps there may be something there which will explain the mystery." In a few moments she returned, bringing a sealed letter  directed to " 31r. William Atherton, Hymeswold," and under the direction was written, "To be delivered to him in case  of my death, by any person into whose hands it may fall." "That must be some other yymneswold besides this one, thirty miles from us,7 said her husband, " for I know almost every man there, and never remember to have heard that name before. Put it away carefully, wife, and some day I  - will inquire about it."    ,               ; So the letter was carefully put' away, and in very trut h, soon forgotten.  Sybil was too much of an acquisition to wish to part with ; her, therefore it was a  great annoyance to Mrs. Wallace, when one day Charles discovered the letter hidden away'   :I among other choice papers, and brought it to light "The  ] hld had a way of making her love her," she said, which she 3ould not resist. She did not even ask her for a bit of bread ike the other children, but there was something so beseeching  n   her tones, that she never could have the heart to deny her :: any thirg; it was, therefore, well for her, and the child too, X hat she was as near an angel as she was. She had but one  4 Objection, and that was to her name. Sybil sounded so eathenish; if her mother had only called her Sally, or   I ,ouisa, or Martha, or even Jane, she should have liked it a reat deal better. It was queer what freaks people took  ito their heads about names sometimes."          .': -   j:i   (CIESTNUT WOOD.         45 It was, therefore, a great disappointment to her, when having the letter forced upon his attention, her-husband insisted that she was in duty bound to forward both child and letter to Hymeswold as soon as he could make the necessary inquiries. At first she would not listen to it, but fher husband knew well that a little reflection and no opposi- tion, was much the sitrcst way of bringing her right; so he left her to come to hier own conclusion about the matter, nor was he at all surprised, 1when, after a few days, she came to hlm to ask '" where Hlymeswold was, and the easiest way of reaching there with Sybil." Fortunately, Mr. Wallace easily learned that Mr. Ather- ton had recently moved into the Hymeswold near them, and a stage, which passed their own door every day, would put them down there at any time. But this time Mrs. Wallace found one reason after another, for deferring. Now it was because Sybil did not seem to have quite as many clothes as she needed; ; For nobody knew," she said, "what sort of folks they were at Mr. Atherton's." Again, a Sybil did not seem quite well, and it would be cruel to send a sick child away among strangers."  To-day, Charles would ask that ".she should stay until after the coming holiday,' and to-morrow little Tom would put up his rosy mouth and tease by a kiss, to have "Thibil tay until after she had made him one more new ball." To the astonishment of all, Sybil herself brought matters to a conclusion, by saying she should like to go, and when urged by Charles half in sorrow and half in anger, to say why, she only replied, so My mamma wished it." Well, if she must, she must, and there isno h elping it,:' ,was all the consolation Mrs. Wallace  could find; and like a brave person who goes to have a tooth drawn, she appointed the first day that should be pleasant, to be the one for the journey. As soon as this was decided, a great change was seen to 4  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7088-00000024"/> "t        CHESTNUT WOOD.  have taken place in Sybil. She ceased all play; she never sang. Charles said " the butterfly had flown away from her heart," and he, too, grew grave, and unwilling to have her long away from his sight. In his heart he hoped the sun would never shine again, and he could not help thinking, boy as he was, that clouds and rain were far preferable in the sky, than within his father's house. He could not tell exactly how he felt; he knew that he was uncomfortable and unhappy, and what was worse, felt quite inclined to blame Sybil for being willing, much more for asking to go away from them. He thought he was justly punished for always wanting to be hunting over the old books and papers, and he almost resolv- ed to take to farming with his father, and, give up all thought of his darling project of an education. Poor Charles! He warred against Fate as a great many older and wiser people do, when it crosses the path of their inclination or affec- tion. The first plea'sant day, every one of the family had been to assure themselves, again and again, that it was pleasant; but not a cloud as large as a man's hand was to be found, and even the most unwilling must be convinced. The bun- dle containing Sybil's scanty wardrobe was ready, and Charles was stationed at the gate to stop the stage when it should pass. As he stood there, swinging upon the hinges, and looking for the cloud of dust which should announce its most distant approach, he felt sorely tempted to let it go by, as if he did not see it; but a moment's reflection convinced him that this could do nothing but defer the separation, and he could not quite forget Sybil's expressed wish to go; so he waited patiently until the noise of wheels, and finally a sight of the well-known bay leaders, left no room to doubt, then gave the call to hurry his mother and Sybil out. When they  were fairly seated in the coach, the long whip was snapped, and the wheels began to turn around once Dmore. Charles    CIhESTNUT WOOD.         47 drew his straw hat over his eyes; he did not like his little brothers to see his tears; but they were there, and years after he remembered this parting with Sybil, as his first grief. Sybil sat close by her adopted mother's side. She did not weep, but she thought she had never been so sad before since the day her own dear mother died. Mrs. Wallace tried to amuse her, for she could not bear to see that still little pen. sive face by her side; it reminded her, too, of the child whose arms she untwined from her dead parent's neck; she would rather much have heard her cry aloud, or she could even have borne better to have had her happy and merry at the thought of leaving them. Not a cow lifted its sedate head from crop- ping the grass, to gaze at them as they rattled by, but Mrs. Wallace had some remark to make about it - not a little calf drew itself lazily from the road; or flock otsheep scampered over the walls, frightened by their approach; not a long row of geese, white and clean as if just emerged from their daily bath, cackled or ran after the stage, but some droll remark or simple pleasantry amused every one of the passengers-every one but Sybil. "I wish, Sybil," said Mrs. Wallace, at last having fairly wearied herself with her fruitless but good-natured efforts, "I wish you would put that little sober face out at that win- dow," motioning to the one nearest Sybil, "and take that pretty, happy one that you always had at home, into this. I a am tired seeing you lo6k so sober." Sybil made a faint effort to smile, but not even the con- e sciousness that many eyes were fixed upon her could enable : her to restrain her feelings any longer. The smile gradually I changed into a sob, and before }Irs. Wallace was aware of it, she had thrown herself weeping with incontrollable grief into her arms. / "Why, Sybil, child! what ails you?" asked Mrs. Wal- lace, almost frightened-she had never seen Sybil but once  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7088-00000025"/> 48         CHESTNUT WOO n) evince so much emotion-" don't cry so, darling; if you do  not want to go, you shall not, and that is all about it. I'll  stop the stage this minute and we will get out, and when the  other one comes, we will go right back, and you shall be my own little daughter, and sister to all those four boys of mine." Suiting the action to the word, she thrust her hand out  of the window, and was about calling the driver to stop, when Sybil, half choked with tears, drew her back. "No, no! Mammna Wallace!" she said, "my own mam- ma wished it, and I must go; but oh! I so much dread it. I love Charles, and John, and Samuel, and all, so much bet-  ter than I ever can new friends. May I come back and see  you sometimes, and will you see that none-not even little Tommy, forget me? Promise me-promise me!' " "You dear little thing," said Mrs. Wallace, taking the child into her lap and holding her as if she was a small in- fant, " they can't forget you, any one of them; nor ever will be so happy again until you come back to live with us. Yes,  I'll make that Mr. Atherton promise you may come, or I will  not leave you; and perhaps, Sybil," she said, a ray of hope  lighting up her face, "after all, the man may not be alive - : now, or if he is, may not care to take such a little crying girl : as you are. I am sure he would not want you if he were to see you now."  It was the first time a reasonable hope of returning had  been held out to Sybil, and her heart readily responded to it.  For the remainder of the journey she was quiet, but no lon-  ger sad, and when the church of Hymeswold was to be seen  from the high hill that overhung the village, Sybil had almost ceased to look upon it as her future home. The stage stopped at the Rising Sun. Of course there was no difficulty in ascertaining where Mr. Atherton lived. The house had been for some time completed, and Mr. Ath-   CHESTNUT WOOD;         49 orton had removed there from New-York with all the, family he had; a large Newfoundland dog, whom he called Neptune. The house was, as I have before said, at some little distance from the village. It had received from its owner the name of Chestnut Wood, on account of the grove of chestnut trees by which it was immediately surrounded. It was a long, irregular building, at first striking the be- holder as being without form or design, but a little nearer view showed that, with an eye to comfort, neither taste nor elegance in architecture had been forgotten. It was in the form of a cross, with Gothic front and wings, the centre reaching to the height of two stories and a half, but the wings, though high, of only one story, with irregular windows. The trees had been allowed to remain close by the walls of the house, but through them was cut a broad gravelled road, and near it a winding walk. Back of the house a large garden was laid out, and it was the astonishment of all Hymeswold that so much had been done in so short a time. A small green-house, already stocked with the rarest plants, was at- tached to one wing of the building which contained the libra- ry, and opened into it by large glass folding-doors. The library itself was elegantly fitted. The sides of the room were lined with rosewood book-cases, simple, but perfect in form, and between the cases was left room for pictures. These had been mostly purchased by Mr. Atherton when abroad, and were the works of the finest masters. Few American artists had been deemed worthy of filling a niche; but here and there a small spirited sketch bore a name which promis- ed that before long the new world should fairly compete with the old. In the centre of the room a Grecian table was filled with loose papers and a few well-worn books. Any one ac- customed to judge of the character of a man by the surround- ings of his home apartment, would have judged rightly of Mr. Atherton if they had said that the book-cases were filled 3 a  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7088-00000026"/> 50         CHESTNUT WOOD. with a well-chosen library to gratify his eye, and satisfy him that nothing was wanting to add to the completeness of the  library; but at the same time, his own choice in reading was very decided, and confined itself to a few well-studied authors. A luxurious arm-chair would have invited a common man more to repose than reflection; but Mr. Atherton's active business habits followed him even into his private life, and he enjoyed the good things of life without abusing them. At the time when the stage had dislodged its dusty, tired passengers, at the Rising Sun, Mr. Atherton had finished rather an unusually busy day's work, and had seated himself in this, his favorite apartment, in his favorite chair. He re- tained his city habits of late hours for his meals, and though the clock had just struck five, he had. but now risen from dinner. Accustomed as he was of late, to a solitary table, when he found himself to day still alone, in the large, des- olate library, he could not, do his best (and he was a man accustomed to an even self-controD, keep his eyes from look- ing at an empty place, left by the side of a portrait, evident- :. ly that of his wife. Twice he started from his chair, with the design of filling it' with some of the pictures that were around. but immediately sat down, though still seemingly . without the power of diverting his attention from the vacant : spot. He shut his eyes, hoping to be able to sleep, but there t still before him was the face he had loved best in life, but  which had long since been shut away from his sight; and the one which for years had hung beside it, where was it?? or where was she whose image it was?  Memory, once awakened, was not to be easily laid to rest, and the dark, I sullen cloud, that lowered upon his brow, was only a slight index to the state of his mind. It was seldom, very seldom,  that he allowed these storms of feeling; but this had been gathering week after week, and month after month, as he had completed one after another of the plans which should make   CHESTNUT WOOD.         51 Chestnut Wood a desirable home. Now, it -was nearly fin- ished; no expense or trouble had been spared upon it. It was perfect in its kind, and it was all for wzhat, he asked himself bitterly again and again. For the few short years which remained to him, of a desolate life, and then to be left to those strangers of whom he had neither known nor heard. - While occupied in these reflections, there was a timid ring at the door-bell. His servants were few, but well train- ed, and in a moment one entered, bringing a letter. He took it almost mechanically; so occupied had he been with his own sad thoughts, that he had hardly noticed the ring at the door, and it was not until his eye caught the handwriting of the direction, that he seemed to give it the least attention. Those fair Italian characters were not to be mistaken! A pang shot to his heart, and a deadly paleness oveipread his face; he had read the words, "To be given in case of my depth." "You may go, John," he said, with a hollow tone, which startled the man, but he immediately obeyed. Mr. Ather- ton attempted to break the seal of the letter,- he tried sev- eral times before he succeeded, and when at last it was open in his hand, not a word was visible to his dimmed and tearful vision. He closed his eyes, and the pent-up tide of affection and regret poured like lava over his soul. "Too late-too late!" burst from his lips. "She has gone, my beautiful Mary is dead. Miserable father that I am." The strong man was bowed like a child, and tears fast as rain fell from be- tween his fingers, as he pressed them closely over his face. He knew that the library door was opened affd shut several times. At seasons of great sorrow, our senses are often keenly alive, and impressions are made vividly upon th m which seem never to be conveyed to the brain. So it wa in this in- stance, and perhaps nothing less than the most violent meas- ures would have roused him to the consciousness that some- thing was expected of him.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7088-00000027"/> 52         CHESTNUT W\OOD. No one felt at liberty to use these-and therefore Mrs. Wallace and Sybil remained sitting in the hall without any notice being taken of them, for nearly an hour. Good Mrs. Wallace, who knew nothing of the contents of the letter, or the connection between the dead writer and the master of the house, evinced quite as much impatience and chagrin at their  detention, as was at all proper, and nothing prevented her taking Sybil and returning from whence she had come, but a  supplicating look in the child's face, which she had never been able to withstand. Sybil herself seemed awed and almost ter- rified by the elegance and stillness of the house. She clung closely to Mrs. Wallace, more closely than ever before, and would whisper, "Hush, hush! he will come soon," when- ever the woman made a rather noisy demonstration of her im- patience. John had gone often back and forth between the hall and the library, perhaps in quite as much trouble and embarrass= ment as apy one; and when Mrs. Wallace insisted that " she would wat no longer, and that if the man, Mr. Atherton, wanted the child, he might come for her to Charleton, -: she had doneeher duty," and rose to leave the house, he was in despair. He had never seen his master other than cold, and grave, and stern before, and would as soon have expected to have seen tears gush from the marble statues ,! that adorned the parlor, as from those dark eyes. He had  an intuitive feeling that there was something in the pale and beautiful face of that little child that would comfort ana g console him, if it could but be brought near to him, and yet he would never have dreamed it possible, to take her to him uncalled. As Mrs. Wallace stood with her hand upon the door,  ready to go, a new thought seemed to. occur to her: "Well!" she said, suddenly turning to John, "I will  tell you what, you may take this child in to where Mr. Ath-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         53 erton is; perhaps there is something in that letter that may make him glad to see her. I will wait here in the hall, and if there is not, why, just bring her back. The quicker the better." Sybil rose without a word, and walked in the direction in which she had seen John go. She opened the library door just as Mr. Atherton removed his hand from his face, and as he raised his eyes, he met those of the child, who had stopped, and was looking steadily upon him. There was nothing in the apparition which seemed to surprise him, yet he looked at her without saying a word; but there must have been something in the traces of tears upon his face, and his sad, subdued expression, which touched Sybil, for no longer hesitating, she advanced to his' side, and said, in a sweet, low voice:  "I came because my mother wished it, sir." "Your mother-and who was your mother, child?  he asked, absently. "She was poor-and sick-and is in heaven now, sir," a answered Sybil, in touching tones. Mr. Atherton opened his arms-the child came timidly to him-he folded her to his heart, and in that long embrace he expressed the hidden expiatory feeling of years. But suddenly, as he had taken the child to him, he put her from him. "Your name, child, what is it?" he said, almost sternly. "Sybil Thornton," said the child, for the first time trembling. "Sybil! That is well. You have your grandmother's  name-you have her eyes-heir hair-you speak like her. I cannot see your own mother, my lost Mary, but I accept you as her recompense." Poor little Sybil! She did not understand one word he was saying to her. She never dreamed that he was her  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7088-00000028"/> 54         CHESTNUT WOOD. grandfather. She remembered that she had always been said to resemble her mother, and what she was " accepted " for, or what " recompense " meant, was all a thing in the dark to'her, and ar she said: "And now, sir, you will let me go back to Mrs. Wallace, will you not?" "Mrs. Wallace! who is Mrs. Wallace?" asked Mr. Atherton, with one of those abrupt tones which startle so much oftener than soothe. "She has been my kind mamma, since my own mamma died; and she is waiting for me now in the hall. Please to . let me go to her, sir."  "I will go with you," said Mr. Atherton, rising. Sybil glided along before him with a soft, noiseless step, peculiar to her, and with a grave, but happy face, seat- ed herself close to Mrs. Wallace. She had been gone but a few moments, but the time to the impatient woman had seemed an hour, and she could hardly, in her anxiety to be  away from so inlhospitable a roof, take notice of its master, who was also standing beside her, watching, with a steady eye, the changes of her countenance. As soon as she be- came conscious of this, she said: "You are Mr. Atherton, I suppose?" lie simply bowed an answer. "Well! I brought the child here -because it was her  mother's wish, and I supposed I must; but it was much against my will, and if you have no very special objection, we will be going back again. Two hours is a good while  for a woman to sit in an entry, and I have seen better man- ners myself."  Mr. Atherton took no notice of what she said; he did  - not appear to hear her; and she went on:  "This child's mother died over a year ago." Mr. Ath-  erton uttered a groan, which went, in spite of her vexation, to  ' .  *          - * ,             ,4i   CHESTNUT WOOD.         55 Mrs. Wallace's heart, and in a softened tone, she continued, looking around her: "Perhaps you may not care to hear about it, or rather we should be alone; it does not co Sybil, darling as she is, any good to hear of such things; yet, I suppose, it is only proper that you should know them." Mr. Atherton motioned to the library door, and she fol- lowed him. Sybil remained in the hall, and sat with her little hands clasped, and her eyes cast down until Mrs. Wal- lace again made her appearance. 'The result of the inter- view was probably not very satisfactory to her, she was so demonstrative herself, that to be obliged to converse with groans only for her answer, was a new thing to her. She, however, had gathered from the emotion evinced, that Sybil's mother must have been a near relative of Mr. Atherton; that he had not treated her kindly, and now regretted it; and mak- ing such inferences as best suited her wishes, she thought he would not care to retain Sybil, but would be very willing that she should return with her to Charleton. Therefore, taking Sybil's hand, with only a common good afternoon, she passed out of the door, and the child with her. Mr. Atherton had remained in the library, and so lost did he seem to be to all external things, that he did not even appear to miss Mrs. Wallace, until he heard the large hall door close, and saw the retreating figures of the woman and little child pass before his window. To spring from it upon the walk, to snatch the child and bear her back, was but the work of a moment; and before Mrs. Wallace became fully aware what had taken place, Sybil was sitting upon her grandfather's knee, with one little arm around his neck, and the other hand busily engaged in wiping away the large tears which were rolling down his cheeks. "Well, I suppose," she said somewhat brusquely, as she entered through the same window, " that maeans Sybil is to stay here. If you had only said so, at first, it would  &#xD;<pb n="56" xml:id="VAC7088-00000029"/> 56         CHESTNUT WOOD. have saved a great deal of wonder, but for my part, I think you had better let her go back with me. She has become used to us, and she seems scared in this great, handsome house, without so much as a child-for I don't see any thing that looks like one-to play with. You had better let her go back with me to my four boys; there isn't one of them that does not dote upon her; and Charles and little Tom love her better than they do me. Come, Sybil, dear! kiss Mr. Atherton, and let us be going! The boys will be tired looking for us now, and I shouldn't wonder if Tommy, poor boy, was cross at being left alone all day. Come!" "Shall I go?" asked Sybil, looking in her grandfather's - face. Never," was his only answer, as he clasped her more closely to his heart. "I cannot go, mamma Wallace," said the child, after a few moments' silence. "You must not let the)boys forget me; and sometimes," she said, glancing timidly at her grand- father, "I shall come and see you. Shall I not, sir?" Mr. Atherton only bowed assent, and seemed unwilling, as Sybil tried to free herself from his arms., to lose her even for a short time. "I will return soon," she whispered softly, and glided from him. Once more taking Mrs. Wallace's hand, without one word of thanks from Mr. Atherton, the two walke d away. Sybil would fain have accompanied Mrs. Wallace to the Rising Suns, and remained with her until she left Hymes- wold; but Mrs. Wallace saw, by her little pale face, that she had already had more fatigue and excitement than she was able to bear, and so kissing her again, and again " good- bye," at the gate of the park, she qlittly wiped away the tears, which would come, and stood watching her until the slight figure was lost behind the large old trees; then with t    &#xD;<pb n="-57" xml:id="VAC7088-00000030"/> CHESTNUT WOOD.         57 many misgivings at the lonely condition in which she had left the child, and murmuring at that fate which had sepa- rated them, she walked quickly back to the Rising Sun. Had the same passengers occupied the stage with her on her return, that were there when she left home, they would hardly have recognized in the still, tearful woman, the one whose ready wit, and pleasant word, had amused them, all for Sybil's sake, on their ride down. Almost five miles be- fore she reached home, she saw a littl boy, with a straw hat and naked feet, come walking brisk. down the road. "If we were only near home," she said to herself, "I should be sure that was my Charles. How queer! that another boy should look so like him-pants on just like 's best ones-and a jacket too-well, now, that is funny!" With a mother's instinct, she put her head further and further from the window, as they came nearer to him, and when opposite, through the cloud of dust, she saw two little bright eyes looking anxiously to the stage. "Why, Charles! Charles Wallace!" she exclaimed, "where in the world are you going to?" "No further," answered the boy, still continuing his anx- ious look into the stage. "Where is Sybil?" "Left her at Hymeswold with a queer old man, her grand- father I guess," answered his mother, with an attempt to ( smile. "Stop, driver; this boy has walked to here to-day;  I guess we must give him a ride home." The driver had been watching the child some time before he could be seen by the passengers, and had been quite pleased by the sturdy, manful way in which he walked. He was therefore very willing to stop and lift him up into a seat be- side him, the inside of the coach being full, and so, though Charles had no opportunity of further conversation with his mother, he seemed to have no wish for it. It -was enough- for him that the sweet face he sought was not there. :{ib   &#xD;<pb n="58" xml:id="VAC7088-00000031"/> 58        CjHeESBNUT WOODY  After A1Xsf[P Warzllace left her, Sybil returned with slow and lingering feet to the house.

WE will now return to Jerry, whom, if we mistake not, we eft hard at work upon the old negro house by Pomp's Pond. Fortunately for him, it was a moonlight night, and although ie had neither the strength of Samson nor Goliah, :yet one part after another of the crazy old building yielded to the strength of his stalwart. arm, and by the time he began to feel really tired-that was a word which was not often found in Jerry's vocabulary-hardly any thing remained but the large stack of chimney, which seemed, as it stood now alone, as if it occupied a space nearly as large as that which had contained the who e house. As Jerry was looking at the destruction he had made, he exclaimed aloud: "Well, now, I ay if that 'ere old nigger could see how it looks here, I believe it would eeny just carry her off to that place where she wants to go so terrible bad; but it's well she can't, and it's well she han't got nothing but that old shawl to wear on her head, or some day she might come trotting back here, for sake of old times.

His home was at the small white house, owned andd   I I i I  &#xD;<pb n="62" xml:id="VAC7088-00000035"/> 62         CHESTNUT WOOD. kept by Miss Palmy Fitch. Miss Palmy was decidedly in the autumn of her life, but during its spring and somewhat lengthy summer, she had been the industrious tailoress of Hymeswold  The little boys whose jackets she had so ambi- tiously besprinkled with yellow buttons, had grown to be men, and she had made their wedding suits, and now their heads were covering with gray hairs, and still she made their clothes, though the fashion never altered, but their grandsons wre already beyond her cut, and patronized the new tailor in the smart shop with the bright red sign and golden letters. But Palmy had worked her share, and, stitched into those coarse garments many more precious hours of her life, than would have sufficed to have brought up a large family of prosperous children in the world. She hlad been obstinately determined since those young days in the spring, when the rich butcher jilted her, against matrimony, in every form and shape. Her customers always noticed that she was never so cross, though she was far from being famed at any time for good nature; still, she was never so positively ill-tempered as when the bashfulness of the bridegroom had betrayed him into an incautious delay respecting a very needful part of the marriage ceremony, and Miss Fitch-as she was then gra- ciously called-had to be coaxed in the most insinuating man- ner, to ply her needle with a little more than usual dispatch. She had been known once-but it was only once-for the storm it waked thoroughly frightened her, to adhere to her always expressed determination " of not killing herself be- cause folks choose to be such fools as to be married."' But the goose and the headless thimble had been good friends to her, a great deal better than many others' husband and children, and with the help of her neat thrifty habits, they had provided her now, in the shadowy autumn upon which she had for some time entered, as neat and pretty a home as there was in the village of Hymeswold. She had a i   I  &#xD;<pb n="-63" xml:id="VAC7088-00000036"/> CHESTNUT WOOD.         63 ittle sum laid up for the coming winter, if she should ive to see it--and if not, she had long since made up er min to whom, and to what, to bequeath her earthly ossession. She had never been like those poor solitary beings who raste so much of life in repinings and useless regrets. Sometimes there was a lonely spot in her heart, which even, he warm goose refused to fill. Sometimes she might have eeen surprised with a tear upon her cheek, or a sigh might ave been heard to echo through her lonely house,-but ,enerally, for the greater part of her time, Palmy stitched earns, and made button-holes, and sewed on buttons, as if hat were the chief end of her existence. From the first aoment she saw Jerry, she took a wonderful fancy to his ;ood-natured sunny face, She did his work cheaper than ny one else, and when he, in his quaint way, praised it " as it for a king," she would have given it to him for nothing, f he had only known and pursued his advantage. Suddenly he whole town of Hymeswold was thrown into astonishment )y Jerry's announcing that, "Miss Palmy, who he always Snowed was a clever critter, if you only took her the right ray, had axed him to come and live with her, promising him Lis board fqr nothing, if in winter he would do her chores, uch as digging paths and sawing wood, and in summer make ler bit of a garden." This story he told with many winks, ind much odd gesticulation, and he stood the whole artillery )f jokes, about " marrying the old maid," with quite as nuch sang froid, as if he had actually intended to commit such an enormity. Miss Palmy did not altogether escape, )ut she only pursed her mouth up a little closer, and wished -her usual wish on such occasions--"that people would  nind their own business, and not be always making such ools of themselves;" and so Jerry, who had some time since been able to exchange his little bundle for a good-sized    &#xD;<pb n="64" xml:id="VAC7088-00000037"/> "        CHESTNUT WOOD. trunk, put it upon Miss Palmy's wheelbarrow, and estab- lished himself quietly in her house. He took special pains always to be punctual at meals, never to be out after the clock had struck the hour of nine, and so he was, as Palmy often thought, no more trouble to her than a cat, nor half so much, for those "pesky creatures" were always her special aversion. This night, after the demolition of Dinah's house, Jerry knew he should be very late; and it must be confessed it was with some trepidation he found himself coming in sight of the town clock. The moon shone full upon it. Half- past twelve! I say, for't,--" said Jerry, stopping short and looking with a most supplicating expression upon the long, silent hands. "Half-past twelve!" he repeated again without moving. "I say, for't, who would have thought it? Now as like as not that old woman will have had hys- terics, and who knows but what I may have been the death of her-she sets a store by me. Now, if that ain't too bad; between two old women, one black and 'tother white, I don't see but I am like to have a night of it; whew! what is to be done? Well," said he, as he began to regain his courage, " it ain't so bad as if I had been off spreeing; and arter all I don't see any harm in working for a home for a homeless critter-so I'll hurry on, for if Miss Palmy is in a fit, she may need a doctor, or something;" so he quickened his steps, and in a few moments swung open the gate to the yard, and entered with as little noise as he could induce his cowhide boots to make.  But Palmy was not a person to have fits-excepting those of temper; and she was now, and had been, for the last two hours and a half, sitting with her little pug nose  pressed close up against the blinds of her bedroom window, looking and listening with all the eagerness of a 'young maiden watching for her lover.

Jerry's heart failed him again-he thought of the 3 and the doctor, and made more noise with the latch. Not a sound was heard in answer. He shook the door solutely with his strong hand. Miss Palmy began to shake r. sides, but very quietly. Pretty soon Jerry lifted the ining brass knocker-it looked more than usually bright him in the moonlight-and let it fall with a heavy sound. ilmy jumped in spite of herself-there was some authority that knock, yet she did not, lee a motion toward undo- g the door.      / Jerry, now really alarmed, left it, and went around to r bedroom window.

Ah! Miss Palmy, as that long, lank figure opened your bedroom door and stood in the kitchen before you, you would have given a great deal to have recalled that petu- lance which made you, after your hours of anxious watch, lock out the erring one! Had he been brought home sick or injured, there would have been no end to your kind, and patient, and almost tender nursing; but now he comes well and uninjured, it is a very different thing. When she saw that he was really there, she drew up her small and generally somewhat bent figure, and without deign- ing a word or look of recognition, swept by him into her room. "Thunder! she is only mad," said Jerry, as he heard the door close behind her. "If I had been sartain of that, you wouldn't have caught me taking all this pains, I can tell you; but there is no helping it now-and if she don't come out of her tantrums, she'll have to git her chores done by somebody else, not me. Women beat all nater when their spunk is up." With this comfortable reflection, Jerry went to his bed, and was soon so soundly asleep that not even a vision of Palmy dared intrude. His late night-work did not prevent his morning's early rising. He was up with the light, and went to some of the many little jobs he had engaged to do in the village. Jerry . could do a great deal of work in a short time, and do it  honestly; no one pretended to find fault with any thing  about him, but that they never could get him when they  : wanted him;  he was very slippery," they said, "and when ' you thought you had him tight, there he was off a mile, hard  at work for somebody else." Still every one was 'eager to  secure his services; and notwithstanding the many annoy- I / l;i J EF-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         67 ances to which he was constantly subjecting them, no one was more welcome when he really came. Daylight had quite reassured him, and when it came time to return to breakfast, he had almost forgotten Miss Palmy's anger of the night previous-still he opened the kitchen door and peeped in a little cautiously before he ven- tured. There was the neat table set as usual, but with only one plate. "Now I say!" ejaculated Jerry, " she is spunky yet. I may as well make a bold push for it first as last, it is neck or nothing-so here it is." "There, Miss Palmy," said he, as he pushed the door wide open, and went in--"I don't wonder you are mad at me; if I were you, I would turn a fellar that had served me such a trick right out of doors-it wouldn't be a bit more than he desarves. I know you muist have been terrible anxius."  Miss Palmy tossed her head-Jerry saw it, and put in; ' not about me, Miss Palmy. I ain't worth caring nothing about, I know; but to be left all alone-if I hadn't had the best reason in the world, I should be a terrible crittur." Palmy had been fidgeting about the kitchen, pulling out, and pushing in the dampers of her stove-lifting up the lid of the tea-pot, and stirring the potatoes, that were never so stirred before, in a most exemplary manner. She had not deigned to look at Jerry, or in any way to evince a know- ledge of his presence,-but when he came to a dead pause in his stream of self-abuse, she felt inclined to take the other side, and say in her frequently short and sweet manner, "' She didn't see any use in a person's making such a fool of themselves." But she managed to express it, as she thought, by an in- dignant toss of the head, and stirred the potatoes harder than ever.  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7088-00000040"/> 68         CHESTNUT WOOD. Jerry became desperate. He could have borne a whole storm of words, but this sulky silence, was, a woman's wea- pon, which he did not know very well how to meet. "Miss Palmy," he said at length, and it-was in a soberer tone, than she had ever heard hi speak before, ;" there ain't no use mincing matters; if you are mad at me, and are' going to stay so, the sooner I go away the bet- ter. I hope you will find some one else to live with you soon, and take good care of them vegetables, that are com- ing on right smart now. I'll pack my trunk, for this is a busy day with me, and I ain't no time to spare." Jerry left the kitchen, and in an incredibly short interval, made his appearance again, with his trunk in his arms. As he passed through the room, he saw there- were arrangements lyiade for breakfast for two. "Ah! she's getting over it," he thought. I' Well, she will have to be in a terrible hurry about it, for I am hungry as a bear." The breakfast smelt uncommonly savory to him, and it is an open question to this day, whether this, or the sight of Palmy, turning her back resolutely to him, and making a sound as if she had been crying moved him most. He was, however, tempted to make one more effort at conciliation-particularly, as she had evinced the wish that he should do so plainly, by put- ting his plate ready for him at table. "Miss Palmy," he said, " you have been very kind to me, and it makes me feel bad to go, but if I must, I must; I am sure, I didn't think you would take it so to heart-because I was out late working like a dog, to make a home for poor  old Dinah. If you had only heard how she took on. last night when I carried her to the alms-house-you would have I wondered I could stop to eat or sleep until I got her back : to the old place again." Palmy with her back still turned, gave one or two little  sobs. which Jerry heard distinctly.  *       tg   CHESTNUT WOOD.         6 "It was enough to make any one cry, Miss Palmy," he said, "and I don't wonder you do; I cried like a baby my- self;? and here Jerry sat down. He felt sure the combat was fought, and the victory won. Breakfast was speedily placed upon the table, and without another word from either, they commenced eating. Jerry had no wish that it should be a silent affair; so he talked very fast, and when it was over and he started for his day's work, he couldn't help smiling at the packed trunk, which stood in his way. "I'll lehve it there," he said, " until noon, at any rate. It's as well to scare her pretty thoroughly this time, it will save doing it again in a hurry." At noon, when Jerry returned to dinner, he was somewhat astonished to find it had disappeared. La, now!" said he, stopping short, " if these women ain't the beatingest set I ever came across! Well, the old wo- man had something oa lug of it, that time, any hpw. I shouldn't be surprised i1e had a crick in her back all winter to pay for it; 'but those who dance must pay the fiddler, " and with this philosophical conclusion, he went in, as if nothing had ever happened to disturb the even tenor of their way. Four months only to build the new cottage! It had seemed short enough to Jerry, when Mr. Atherton first proposed it; but how much shorter it grew"as days and weeks flew by. Mr. Atherton had so many new, " gimcracks," as Jerry called them, that they often seemed to him to double the work, and he called the things by " such awful hard names." Insteadof a plain " ruff," he wanted one with " a ve- randahLroof," and then where he had always made a porch, there must be a "vestibule." He wanted a cornice and an architrave, and so many " outlandish things," that Jerry felt sure more than once, that nothing of a home wouldl be left to Dinah, but a little square room all "set in gingerbread."  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7088-00000041"/> 70         CHESTNUT WOOD. Jerry's perplexed look, his frequent-" now do tell us," and "you don'tsay so," very much amused Mr. Atherton. Per- haps he took a little more pains, than was really necessary, to call things by their architectural names. The fact that Jerry was by no means wanting in strong good sense, as well as quick, ready wit, exposed him often in one way and another, to these trials. One thing, however, was a little ridiculous iR him, after he had learned the meaning of the new terms, nothing would induce him to use them. He in- sisted on calling the verandah the pizarra-and talked about the " mop board," and the " chimbley," and the " jists," until Mr. Atherton began to suspect him of some obstinacy in the frequent repetition. Poor Jerry! he really grew thin upon the business- / he had never been in the habit of being satisfied with a regular day's work and pay, such as would have proved sufficient for any other man ; he calculated to earn that,  and half as much again by the odds and ends, which he was always engaging, and now it seemed to him as if the good people of Hymeswold were possessed by a most unac- commodating spirit. They all wanted him, and wanted him at the same time. They had the feeling, that as they had given him employment, when he was a stranger, and had no- thing to recommend him, they had, now that he had made a good name for himself, a right over him, which it was an imposition upon them, in him, to try to resist. For the first two months of his probation, he bore gall this very good naturedly, but when the time was half out, he began to feel that the success of his whole future life  depended upon the accomplishment of this "job," at its pro- ; -per time. He learned now a whollynew lesson. He had been so accustomed to have every one waiting for him, that it was strange times when the mason promised him, as he  had often done that same mason, day after day, to come to  -ai   CHESTNUT WOOD.         71 his share of the work, and neglected to come. When he did make his appearance, Jerry was busy teaching himself to lay bricks, and if it were not for that dreaded day before Christmas, the mason would have been sent away while he built ' the chimbley." But it was all good for Jerry; it taught hilm in a few months a lesson, which otherwise he might not have learned in a whole'lifetime. By dint of working in season-and out of season-really, by passing through more discipline for making and keeping a promise- for a lesson in that class of practical trutths, which areapt to be held so lightly, by our whole working classes, the building of Dinah's house was worth more to Jerry than it could prove to the poor old creature herself; and we do not take at all into account that greatest of all influences-for ennobling a character, the power of doing good to others by self-sacrifice. Christmas was to come on a Wednesday, this year, and as Miss Palmy had been duly informed, Jerry remained at the cottage for the two previous nights, that he might work until nearly morning; and he 'wished, also, to be sure the new building was perfectly free from damp, so that old Dinah would run no risk of taking cold. Just as the clock struck twelve on Tuesday night, Jerry, who had rather deferred it until that moment, drove in the last nail that was needed to finish; and as his heavy strokes sounded far and near, through the still night, they made to his ear very sweet music. As the dead iron buried itself /  further and further in the wood, it seemed to become invest- i  ed with life, and Jerry held quite a discourse with it. "Well, I don't wonder," he said, " that you go in smart. I should think you would-kinder pleasant, ain't it now-to feel you are finishing up this tarnal job? Won't that 'ere old Dinah's eyes shine, like a cat's in the dark, when we bring her here to-morrow?

' A sweet, a very sweet sleep, Jerry had that night-lie did not waken until a loud knock at the, door-which he had carefully fastened to try the bolt, awakened him. He rub- bed his eyes, and could not recall, so tired was he with excitement, and hard work the day before, where he now was. Another knock, louder and more imperative than the first, soon settled his whereabouts. He knew it was Mr. Atherton. And sure enough, warmly wrapped up in a fur coat, there he stood, with a less stern, and much more benig- nant face than usual.  "I wish you a merry Christmas, Jerry!" he said, as he entered the house. "You are snugly settled in your bachelor quarters, I see." ' Yes, sir," answered Jerry, with comical gravity, only I am going to bring a woman here, by and by, and the mischief on't is-that she's na'ry as young nor as white, as I expected to marry. It is something of a disappointment to me, sir; but for all that, I wish you a very merry Christmas." 'It is not Miss Palmy Fitch, then?" said Mr. Ather- ton, with a scrutinizing look.' "Oh, la! no sir"-said Jerry, laughing outright. "If I had to choose from either, I would about as soon have Dinah as Palmy, not that they ain't both very nice folks, sir, but ' there is no accounting for likin But any how, I gucss it's Dinah, to-day, sir!   \ "So be it then, Jerry; you  e done your part like a- man, and now it only remains for me, to do mine as well. f' Here, Patrick!" said he, stepping to the door and motioning   CHESTNUT WOOD.         73 to a man upon a wagon, which he had stopped at a short distance from the house, "drive up-nd unload." Jerry was there by the time it came, to lend a helping hand, and soon the pantry was stocked with a greater sup- ply of groceries than Dinah had ever possessed at any one time during her whole life. The old furniture had been carefully stored away by Jerry-and every article was now restored as nearly as possible to the position it had occu- pied in the old house. All were there but the old oaken table and chair which had accompanied Dinah to the alms-house, not a thing had been injured or forgotten, not even old Pomp's pipe-for which Jerry had built a little shelf, like the one on which it always used to be in the old chimney. Directions were now given to Patrick to go around to the alms-house, after Jerry should leave with Dinah, and bring the chair, table, and Bible, and drive with all speed ba different road from the one thev should take, so to have m there when they should reach the house. Between elve and one, Jerry was to go-and a great puzzle it was o him how he should bring the old w   an without ex- posure.  "Now," he said to Pat, " if I was a woman, I could take my own clothes, you know; but I say, for't, how Dinah's little black head would look peeping out oA my coat, and the vest you know might be too tight for her," then Jerry laughed a very loud and a very happy laugh-but it did not help him out of his trouble. He thought of app'lying to Mr. 'Atherton, but Pat suggested that Mr. Atherton was not likely to have any more articles of female dress than Jerry himself-a fact which Jerry rather reluctantly recognized. The more he reflected upon it, the more troubled he became. "That old red and yellow shawl never could do," he said, half to Pat and half to himself. "It's as thin as vanity, and it is really awful to think of taking a fellow-creature out 34    VOL. i.-4   &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7088-00000043"/> 74         CHESTNUT 'WOOD.            'i without having her properly clothed this cold weather. There," he continued, his face suddenly lighting up, "I say, for't, if I havn't got it now! There is my blue frock-that sounds like a woman's garment, don't it Pat?--its warm, too, for it's all wool,-then she can put the yellow shawl right over it, and that will do'the- business," and so 'having arranged the mnatter, as he thought, in a most satisfactory manner, he put the last finishing-touches to furnishing the house, and went home to get the frock. Not a merrier heart to keep Christmas than his was there in Hymeswold, and so any one would have thought that heard him whistle as he went. Palmy heard him some time before he reached theJlouse, and knew that*Dinah was to go back to her old hom. - Her face was almost as happy as Jerry's when he opened the doom; and when he told her what he had come for, she laughed the best-natured laugh Jerry thought he had ever heard from her. "Now, Jerry, don't be rfo making a fool of yourself," she said. "How that old black woman would look in your blue frock!" The idea was very amusing to her-for the more she   . thought of it, the harder she laughed; but for Jerry to look at her face would have been enough, if there had been -nothing more. He stopped short-that was a great trick of - : his when he was partly astonished and partly troubled, and said--  "La, now, Miss Palmy, don't laugh at a feller. It's the only woman's thing I've got in the world. I guess she . would look queerer in my coat and pants-wouldn't she?" This idea seemed more ridiculous still to Palmy, for she : shook her sides as they had not been shaken before for full forty years. "Now, Jerry," said she, as soon as she could speak,   CHESTNUT WOOD.         75 "don't make a fool of yourself. Why, one sleeve of your coat would swallow Dinah all up. Only to think of" her!" and then followed another, to Jerry, appalling laugh. "Well, Aiss Palmy,"  said he, now in real trouble, "what shall I do? I ain't got nothing else-and I don't 1klnow no-women to be a borrowing of;. besides, she is a nig- . gcr, you know--and the white folks would as soon touch pisen, as any thing she has wore-though they jist as soon eat cakes she makes with her black- hands; and for one, I don't see any difference worth speaking on." ;' Why, perhaps then you don't know," answered Palmy, trying hard to subdue the laugh which yet would come out in little bursts, interlmittently, as chills come on after fever, "that a nigger's hands are as white inside as mine; and a neater person than old Dinah, there ain't in all Hymeswold. I should just as soon she would wear any thing of mine, as any body else."  "Well now, if that are ain't kind in your" said Jerry, catching at an idea which had never even suggested itself  - to him before. "That's mighty kind of you, Miss Palmy,  and I whnder I didn't think of your being "a woman afore; any old thing that's warm--that old hood, that's hanging up in the stoop. I declare I never thought about a bonnet be- fore-and how she would have looked bare headed, this cold day. Some old thing, Miss Palmy,-you are mighty kind." Nothing had been further from Palmy's thoughts, than to make any such offer--but even she could not now with- draw. Her inclination to laugh, however, was gone, and trouble seemed to have changed faces-for hers was clouded, and Jerry's all sunshine. What was to be done. It had been years since she had given away even as much as the value of a pin; and now to have to send a whole suit, and that a warm one, was as great a call upon her generosity as it was unexpected.  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7088-00000044"/> 76         CHESTNUT WOOD. "I don't Inow," she said, petulantly; "I ain't in the habit of lending things, but if I must I must." Jerry did not contradict her-and after being gone for some time, and a great deal of rummaging, she made her ap- pearance, carrying an old red plaid claak, which had been her mother's, and the hood from the entry. "Now, I say for it!" exclaimed Jerry, surveying both with the most intense admiration.' "That 'ere queen in the Bible, when she went to meet Solomon, couldn't have beat it. It's -a perfect beauty. I wonder now I'never saw you wear it, Miss Palmy." "Well, it is handsome," answered Palmy, Jerry's happy face beginning to make her feel good-natured in spite of her- lelf, " and you may tell Dinah I make her a Christmas pre- sent of it." "You beat all nature" said Jerry; "now who would lhave thought on't. I declare old Dinlal's made to-day,-and -the hood, too, Miss Palmy." i/ ' " "The hood, I/don't know about that," said Palmy. "I ' use that a great deal to run about in." "But- it ain't nigh as becoming as your other," said Jerry, coaxingly. "No-I know," answered Palmy, " and I rather think it isn't best to do things by halves-so you may give her that hood, Jerry." / Jerry began in great haste to roll the clothes up. Palmy helped him-aid dropping his blue frock, which he had held fast through all the previous interval, he started with even a happier heart than he had entered the house, to complete his business. He found old Dinah, where he might have found her al- most any afternoon since he left her at the arms-house, sit- ting in her large chair, with her Bible upon her knee, her lips moving, and her fingers tracing word after word. She   CHESTNUT WOOD.         " did not look up when Jerry entered. She supposed it was one of the many interruptions to which she was so liable, and when he said, "A merry Christmas to you, Dinah," a flush of sudden pleasure was discernible even in her dark face. Jerry had made her frequent visits since she had been there, but he had never, neither had any one else, told her of the new home which was preparing for her. Indeed, no one had known for what purpose the cottage was building but Mr. Atherton, Palmy Fitch, and himself. He there- fore found a new and very unexpected obstacle arising in making the matter known to old Dinah so as not to agitate her too much. He talked with her some time upon such subjects as he thought might be interesting to her, and then said, "Dinah, I have brought you a Christmas present from Miss Palmy Fitch. See here!" and he unrolled the cloak and hood before Dinah's wonderingeye. "Ain't that a perfect beauty now, Dinah?-put it on and let's see how it fits." Dinah got up quietly, and stood for the trial. Jerry put it on, and even attempted to tie the hood, over the white cap-strings, but he was so awkward about it that Dinah was fain to do it herself. When fairly equipped, Jerry went into ecstasies over her. "Come, Dinah," he ended with,-" it's a beautiful arternoon, and Christmas, too-suppose you go and take a ride with me; I will take you down to the old place, if you will." The words seemed to act upon Dinah like magic-she immediately turned to go out of the door. Jerry followed, and before the crowd, who did not at first know Dinah in her new dress, had time fully to recognize her, she was in the wagon, rat-- tling away over' the frozen grognd. Jerry had taken the precaution to put a buffalo into the vehicle, and often tucked it- down around Dinah as tenderly as if she were a younger and fairer companion.  ' He did not drive fast-the road was very rough, and he 4 '  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7088-00000045"/> 78     -   CHESTNUT WOOD. wished to be sure and allow ample time for Patrick to reach the house before him. But at length they came to the last patch of trees that hid it from view, and Jerry knew that it was quite time for Dinah to be informed of the change. Now Dinah, shouldn't you like to see a pretty little house with a pizarra, and all grown right up where tfiat oJd rackety thing was?  "No," said Dinah, very decidedly, " old house where old Pomp died; no new one while Dinah lives." Well, but Dinah," said Jerry, reining in his horse, "that 'ere old thing came down, all of it, one night; there wan't nothing left standing there next morning but the chnbley.' "God have mer4e on poor Dinah!" said she, with pre- cisely the same tone of piteous despair that had so troubled Jerry when he carried her away. "Oh, la! Dinah," he said quickly, " don't for pity's sake begin that again; the Lord has had mercy on you,-and so has Mr. Atherton,--sce what they have both made on pur-  pose for you.' The cottage was full in sight-the blue smoke curled up gracefully from the chimney, and a prettier, neater, more tasteful little home, never was given to any one before. The look of astonishment in Dinah's face was almost painful- but in a moment large tears began to roll down her cheeks, and she repeated in low tones to herself, "The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup-thou maintain- est my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in very pleasant places-yea, I have a goodly heritage." By the time she had finished these verses, they bad stopped at the door, and Jerry looking in to assure himself that all was right, came back to the wagon, and almost lifted Dinah out. The fire was burning cheerily, very cheerily--it cast its cheerful glow ^ over the room-it cast its warmth and light into Dinah's J   CHESTNUT WOOD.         79 chilled heart-it melted away in a moment all the frost and cold which had been gathering there ever since she left her homec-it brightened in her dim eye, and glowed upon her black visage, until'life and youth seemed almost again to rise from the flames. Nor did the glow and warmth of that fire end there; it lighted in Jerry's kind breast a flame which never went out -and which evdewhen he was old and infrm, as Dinah was now, burnt on unextinguished, and unextinguishable. Even Mr. Atherton, in the snug parlor of the Rising Sun, felt it creeping in through the windows and under the sills of the doors, and diffusing itself around the room, driving away those shades of loneliness and ennui which were wont to set- tle so darkly upon him. . )^y   &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7088-00000046"/> CHAPTER VI. BY the time the new house of Chestnut Wood was finished, Jerry had succeeded, as he said he should, in making him- self very necessary to Mr. Atherton. He had gradually given up all his other employers, and plenty was found for him to do, either in working at his trade, or in superintend- ing the laying out of the spacious grounds. He was not only now an honest workman, but, what he had (ver been before, trusty and truthful. It can hardly be supposed that he would have been so, had he been again exposed to the same temptation of wishing to please and serve every one; but with only one master, and one business, and a good be- ginning, he soon became Mr. Atherton's right-hand man. Mr. Atherton had urged Jerry's leaving Miss Palmy Fitch's, and coming to live as head gardener with himself- but this temptation Jerry had steadfastly resisted. There was something much more independent in having a home of one s own. The great house looked grand and very forbid- ding to him, and withal his good heart would not let him leave the ' poor lone woman," as he called her, entirely to herself. In spite of her many little infirmities she had been generally kind to him. Besides, it seemed to be a comfort e   ;^ krCHESTNUT WOOD.               81 to her to have him to depend upon--and uninteresting as ^ he was, Jerry felt a little flattered by the position. He had now been with Mr. Atherton more than a year, and every thing began to be " ourn " on the establishment. There was something in the generous style and finish, which was every where adopted, that was very congenial to his ideas of "spunk and slickness," two words which he used for enterprise and beauty, without reference or care for any dictionary whatever. He was perfectly at home about the house, particularly the library, and went in and out as he had inclination or business. Just after little Sybil had fallen to sleep upon the floor, with her head upon old Nep- tune, Jerry opened the door, with the slight knock which commonly announced his approach, and entered. "Well, now!" said he, stopping short as his eye rested upon the child, "if that ain't jest the prettiest pictur I ever seed, any how! Where in natur did she come from, Mr. Atherton?" He gradually sank his voice so that the last words were uttered in a low whisper, and Mr. Atherton only making a sign for him to be silent, without giving any answer, Jerry began to creep softly into the room upon the toes of his great cowhide boots. He threw his long body from side to side, accompanying each motion with a corresponding con- tortion of the face, as if that would take the squeak out of those noisy boots-but the more he tried, the vainer appear- ed to be his efforts, and at last stopping in despair he said, half to them and half to Mr. Atherton, -i  "Jarseph!" a common exclamation of his when in much trouble, "if I had both of Farmer Brown's pigs tied on to X my feet they couldn't squeak worse." X   But Jerry's boots might have made a great deal more noise, and they would not have wakened the tired sleeper; so he soon found, and advancing without fear, he bent over the VOL. .-4*  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7088-00000047"/> 82         CHESTNUT WOOD.      l beautiful child and seemed entirely lost in admiration and thought. At last looking up, he said, "Who is it, sir?" "My granddaughter, Sybil." ' Sybil; well now that is a funny name-but she is the prettiest creatur I ever see. What are you going to do with her-I mean who have you got to take care on her?" "I don't know, Jerry, I was just thinking of that my- self. Do you know any one?" '"Mrs. Giles, that is, your housekeeper, seems too short and sour like, to have the care of a child. I dare say she never had any of her own, did she?" "I don't know, but she is better suited to keep the ser- vants in order, than to look after a little motherless child- still there is no help for it to-night. Ring the bell for me, Jerry." John answered it, and Mrs. Giles was immediately sent for. A little short woman, with pinched features and small, keen, black eyes, appropriately dressed, made her appearance. She was the neatest and the smartest housekeeper in the world-but had spent so much of her life in quarrelling with  the flies, hunting up neglected dust, ferreting out dirty cor- ners, unravelling the knotty mysteries of small thefts, and fretting, and rating the servants, that she had necessarily acquired a sourness and acerbity of temper, which, as Jerry said, fully unfitted her for the care of those little beings who, in the morning of life, require to be fed so largely on kind looks and gentle words. Mrs. Giles had been aware-very little passed at Chest- nut Wood of which she was in ignorance-of the arrival of Mrs. Wallace and Sybil; she had indeed been p eeping over the banisters at them pretty much all the time they were kept in waiting in the hall, and had been both annoyed and vexed at what she considered a breach of politeness in    f-I      CHESTNUT WOOD.         83 her master. At last she became fairly puzzled at the move- ments and counter-movements which seemed to be taking place, and when she saw Sybil returning alone and entering the library, like one at home, she was obliged to come down from the dignified position, which she always endeavored to maintain, and inquire of John, " what it all meant." John was too glad, for once, to have the power in his own hands, to care to relinquish it. So he was obstinately dull through all the questioning and cross-questioning, and in the end Mrs. Giles knew just as much about the matter as she did when she had commenced. She had been all eyes and ears ever since, and had been repeatedly to the library- door to hear what was to be heard. John found her, there- fore, very near, when her presence was actually required, and she evinced no surprise at what might otherwise have been an unexpected sight-a little child asleep on the libra- ry floor. "This is my grandchild, Sybil," said Mr. Atherton, as she entered. "I wish you to prepare a room for her, and look after her for the present. You may take, as her room, the large east chamber that looks out upon the garden, and as soon as it is ready, bring Margy and take her up to it,- or stay, I will carry her myself." "And her luggage, sir? ) asked Mrs. Giles in a prompt business tone. "Sure enough, Mrs. Giles, I don't know what she brought, cl-  or if she brought any thing,"--a pang shot to Mr. Atherton's heart; "inquire of John." At this moment, John entered bringing a bundle tied up in a large blue and white handkerchief, which, he said, had just been sent down from the "Rising Sun." All seemed to recognize it, as the "missing luggage," and at a sign from -I:  Mr. Atherton, John carried it out. In a short space of timelMrs. Giles reappeared, the room  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7088-00000048"/> 84         CHESTNUT WOOD, was ready, and the child appearing to have no idea of wak- ing, before the next morning, was carefully lifted by Jerry, who seemed quite at home in the business, and to suppose itl was impossible for Mr. Atherton to accomplish it safely, and carried without disturbance to her room. Old Nep watched them until he saw that all was safe, then rising, shook his shaggy sides, as if he had been the most important actor in the little scene. The room to which Sybil was conveyed, was a very beautiful one. It was large and high, with two long win- dows, reaching nearly to the floor, and commanding fine views of the garden, the fields, and the hills beyond. It was fitted up with every little tasteful thing that is com- monly considered as belonging to a lady's apartment, and its use had been one of the puzzles to Mrs. Giles which she was very happy to have at last explained; for she immediately considered it as a settled point that the child had been expected aince Mr. Atherton determined to build, and move  into the country. She had been for the last seven years in his family, and had never so much as heard of the existence of the child, but she knew that there were some family incidents, which Mr, Atherton never would have inquired into, and that she had found, and been ordered to preserve with care, many articles which must have belonged to a young and accomplished female. This she had faithfully done, and the little Sybil now entered upon the inheritance uninjured. Whether Mrs. Giles was unused to a child's simple toi- let, or whether she was purposely a little rough, that she might awaken Sybil, it would be difficult to say; but certain it is, she wakened, and finding herself in a strange room, surrounded by strangers, she covered her face with both her little hands, and began to cry violently. "Why, how queer that is," said Mrs. Giles, suspending   CHESTNUT WOOD.         85 operations, and coming around in front of Sybil to get a view of her-what can be the matter with the child?" One kind word, and Sybil would have thrown her arms around her neck, stranger as she was, and sobbed her grief soon away; but there was something in the hard manner of the housekeeper which immediately dried her tears, and after a few deep suffocating sobs, she removed her hands from her face and quietly submitted to be made ready for bed. Mrs. Giles was somewhat surprised, when, instead of going directly, she saw Sybil kneel beside her bed, and fold- ing her little hands, and raising her head, heard her whisper her evening prayer. Then Margy, who had stood by, without daring to offer the slightest aid, approached Sybil, and with the warmth of a true Irish heart, as she lifted her from her knees said- "And it's a darlint of a child you are; you knows about praying, like a little angel, and I dare say it's sent you are from hiven, for it's more like the childers there, your'e for looking, than like flesh and blood; so honey I there! Margy will put you in as easy like," laying her down; "s now isn't that beautiful? I made it my very best for you, and sure I did." Sybil's lip trembled, she felt inclined to cry again, but she did not, although she kept tight hold of Margy's hand, after she had laid her down. "What is your name?" she asked softly. "Margy," answered the pleased girl. "Well, Margy, don't go away from me, stay with me." "Bless her little heart and soul, she is afraid," said Margy. "No, Margy wouldn't leave her for any thing in the world." And Margy faithfully kept her word; she sat by the child, and talked to her, and sung to her, until the little tired creature was once more soundly asleep. Then followed a long consultation between Margy and Mrs. Giles, for on such extra occasions, Mrs. Giles could :il  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7088-00000049"/> 86         CHESTNUT WOOD. afford to be both communicative and inquiring, and in the library, there followed also a consultation between Mr. Atherton and Jerry, the result of which shall be made known to the reader at some future time. The first thing the eyes of Sybil rested upon the next morning when she wakened was the broad good-humored face of Margy. For form and features it was as absolutely ugly a one as she had ever seen; but in the coarse yet tidy hair, the small gray eye, set in the head obliquely, and the little, very little pug nose, with a mouth broad and'large enough to make up for any deficiency in regard to beauty; there was visible so much kindness and almost gentleness of feeling, that if Sybil thought of her looks at all, she would have pronounced them very pleasing. Margy had been deputed by Mrs. Giles to take up the child when it was time to waken and dress her, but Mr. Atherton's orders had been that she should sleep as long as she could, so Margy had spent all the morning creeping in and out of Sybil's chamber looking at her as she lay asleep; and falling every moment more and more in love with the beautiful child. It is remarkable, with what unerring taste the eye of a simple uneducated person will select and appreciate what is fair and lovely. They seem to have given them, by intui- tion, what others more fastidious and better educated, ac- quire only by years of discipline. Sybil's first impulse was to throw her arms around Mar- gy's neck and ask her " where she was;" but before Margy with her fresh Irish brogue could explain it to her, Sybil remembered the whole. She had been accustomed while staying with Mrs. Wal- lace, to performing the more simple acts of her toilet her- self, so it seemed awkward and unpleasant to have to be bathed and dressed, as if she were a child instead of a little   ::      CHESTNUT WOOD.         87 girl, eight years old. But she was patient and quiet until Margy came to her hair, and then, such truly Irish work did she make, endeavoring to brush and comb the curls, that Sybil now laughed, and now would find the tears starting into her eyes, as some unlucky catch of the comb would threaten to separate half of her hair from her head. Such a looking fright as she was, when Mrs. Giles, attracted by the length of time which Margy was losing, came to see what had detained her. The hair was standing on end, all around her head; tears were in her eyes, and Margy was beginning to be in despair as she found the'greater her efforts to bring it into order, the more dishevelled and tangled it became. "Och! and indaad! Mrs. Giles," she said, as she saw mle housekeeper enter, "and the more I slick up Miss Sy- il's hair the more bad it is for looking, and I can't tell what has got into the craythur-the hair, I mean, for sure the child is a born angel." With a frizzly pate, I should think," answered Mrs. Giles in the same dry, hard tone, in which she had spoken to the child the night before. "I Here, give me the comb " She took it, and gave with it sundry little pulls and twitches, which if they did not really give Sybil as much pain, were in- finitely more annoying than Margy's efforts at hair-dressing. But the hair seemed to be now fairly out of temper, and Mrs. Giles, much to Sybil's dismay, was sending for ,her scissors to clip it into better shape, when she ventured to ask to be allowed to try it herself first. Mrs. Giles reluc- tantly consented, and Sybil going to a basin of water, wet it thoroughly, and before it had time to dry, bydint of much coaxing and pulling reduced it to order. When she was taken to the library to her grandfather, it hung in large massive curls about her neck, and had Mrs. Giles executed her pur- ;.'   &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7088-00000050"/> 88         CHESTNUT WOOD. pose of cutting it short, she would have lost a very great addition to her beauty. Her grandfather had been listening for a long time for the sound of that little foot upon the stairs. He had been tempted many times to steal up to her chamber, and assure himself that the whole had not been one of those waking dreams, which had so haunted and poisoned his lonely hours; but he had restrained himself, and strove to be content to wait until the child should appear ; and when the door open- ed, and the little creature, with her timid, gentle step, stole in, and came softly towards him, he could not resist the incli- nation to catch her in his arms, and press her to his heart. Sybil was more frightened than pleased, and when he placed her again upon the floor, looked around, as if anxious to make her escape. Neptune, who was in his accustomed place, seemed to understand her, for getting leisurely up, he walked with much dignity to the door of the conservatory, then stopping, looked back for Sybil to follow. "May I go, grandpapa?" said Sybil. The grandfather absently nodded acquiescence, his mem- ory was already far. away, living over hours, and scenes which, uncalled and unwished, had started up before him. With the help of Jerry, and Margy, and old Nep, Sybil soon became domesticated at Chestnut Wood, and not only domesticated, but in a fair way to be wholly spoiled. Her grandfather surrounded her with every toy and book suitable to her age; he ordered for her rich and costly dresses from the city, and contented himself in watching the deve- lopment of her character, without any special effort to mould, or improve it. He would frequently place little tests around her--some- times to try her generosity-sometimes, to try her temper, but most frequently of all to test her love of truth. When Sybil came off victorious--no one could 'be more (              .   ::/      CHESTNUT WOOD.         89 i  delighted; when she was found wanting, he became at once cold and stern-and the child who had no other punishment to fear-began to dread nothing so much, as to have grand- papa displeased. M r. Atherton owned a very choice box of shells; they had been collected for him by a friend in India, and they were prized,more as a gift from him, than for their own intrinsic value. These he occasionally allowed. Sybil to look at-having impressed fully upon her the necessity of hand- ling them with the greatest care. One day, when she was busy playing with them, her grandfather went out, and for want of a more agile companion, she had put Nep in the place and given him as many shells as. she took for herself-with each one, as she laid it down before him, giving him the caution, "not to break it." But, between them, the very largest and finest was broken into pieces. Sybil looked at it in terror; her first impulse was to re- turn the shells to their box, put the cover upon it, and put it away, where her grandfather was accustomed to keep it. This she did-then gathering up the bits, as they lay before Neptune's great paw, went to the window to throw them out. "But grandpapa will see them if I put them here," she said; "what shall I do?" Her doubts and unhappiness found vent in tears-and i; while she was crying, with her face hidden in her apron, she felt something cold touch her suddenly upon her cheek; she -  started very much alarmed, and looked up, to see Nep stand- ing alone by her side, with a very long face, and much won- der expressed in it. L/   ': Oh go away! you naughty dog," she said, pushing him from her; "you did it more than Hand grandpapa never looks soberly at you, only at Sybil-and he loves these shells so much-oh, you naughty, naughty dog!" Nep too  the matter very coolly, for finding his efforts at  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7088-00000051"/> 90         CHESTNUT WOOD. conciliation were useless, he turned and walked quietly away; but they were not quite as useless as ,they appeared, for the interruption gave Sybil an opportunity to become quiet. As the fear of reproof wore off, her own courageous na- ture spoke for itself; and taking the bits in her little hand, she tied on her bonnet, and went out to hunt up her grand- father. The first person she met, was Jerry. "Halloo, there- little Miss Sybil!" he called out, "where are you going, and what have you got in that pretty hand? My sakes,'7 said he, as he came nearer, " if she han't been a crying! Now, I'll bet a fourpence she has broke that big doll, or Mrs. Giles has been a, scolding her. Now, tell Jerry all about it." He took her up in his arms, and. laying her little lily face against his nut-brown one, she, began to cry again. "Tell Jerry, tell him," said the man, soothingly, ' that's a good girl; tell him and- he will mend your dolly, or whip naughty Mrs. Giles. Now tell him all about it." ' Where is my grandlfther, Jerry?" sobbed the child. u Grandpa! oh, he's gone down to the clearing, and won't be back'lhe;se two hours. " ' I muzst see him, Jerry--zozv, this minute." "Oh, but Sybil, you can't do that-your little feet can't carry you so far." "Then your big ones must, Jerry." "Now, that would be funny, to have a horse named Jer- ry, wouldn't it? and the very first hour I get for my own, you shall have a ride away down to Pomp's pond to see old Dinah. Won't that be nice?" , The child gave a ready assent, but still begged to be at least shown the way now. Jerry, however, was for once too busy to comply with her request; and carrying her to the house, as he thought, safely deposited her there. Sybil stood with pouting lip, and swelling heart, watch-   CHESTNUT 'WOOD.         91 ing him as lie went away. She had been of late all unused to being -denied, and now it seemed to her that it was very cruel, when she wanted to see her grandpapa so much ;! so when Jerry was hidden behind the trees, she slipped outi of the house, and went in pursuit of the " clearing.' Her broken shell was tightly clasped in one hand, and the other r resting upon Nep's head, who, seeing her go out a second timle alone, had consented to forget the offence he had re- ceived, and go with her. All trace of fear had faded from her heart, she had only one wish, that was to see her grand-- father, as quickly as she could. So she began to sing her little songs, and singing and talking to Ncp, she went happily on, she knew not where. It was a beautiful fall afternoon; the trees under which she walked were gay as gay could be; Ilolwr,she was running as fast as her feet could carry her, in pursuit of a bright yellow leaf, which the wind carried in its play along before her; and now would mlake Nep stand still, while she stood upon his back to reach that cluster of showy red, that hung so dazzlingly above her. But for all thlese things, she was not conscious that she stoppedlong; so, when it began to grow a little dark, she was much sur- - prised, and called "grandpapa" supposing the clearing to be very near. No grandpapa answered: and Sybil began to be afraid of the stillness, and the twilight. Before and be- hind her, and on each side, nothing was to be seen, but thick  woods; she did not know that she could trust herself to the care of Nep, and he would bring her out safely;, but she wandered on and on, now turning without knowing it, anid re- tracing her steps, and all the time calling " grandpapa, grand- papa I)  As it grew darker, she began to be very tired, and at last her little feet entirely refused to support her. The way had been rough, her shoes and stockings were torn, and when a brier brought the blood from her ankle, she sat down under a tree and soon cried herself to sleep. Nep lay close by her  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7088-00000052"/> 92         CI1HESTNUT WOOD. side, and put one of his large paws carefully over her. The bright stars peeped down upon her from between the thick leaves which canopied her, and she slept as quietly and as sweetly, as she would have in her own home'at Chestnut WNood.   CHAPTER VII. As it was growing dusk, Mr. Atherton returned from his walk to the clearing. It was later than he was accustomed to be out, since Sybil had claimed so much of his thoughts and time; but the winter was approaching, and there was much. which he wished to see finished, before the earth should be frost bound. Now, as he walked home with a quickened step, he thoughtiwith more than usual pleasure of the little foot that should come bounding out to meet him, and the sweet voice that should welcome him. He was, therefore, disappointed; when he had reached even the Library door, and yet no Sybil. There was some slight trepidation in his touch as he hastily opened it, and when he found it empty, he forgot the formality of a bell, but seeking Mrs. Giles, in- quired for Sybil. Mrs. Giles had supposed Sybil to be away with him, and had not thought of looking her up. In a moment ihe whole house was astir, and "Sybil," was eagerly called from every direction. No answer, not even a trace of the child. Margy, whose tears were more ready than her wits, after looking where she as sent, seated herself upon the door-step, and was bewail- ing with true Irish pathos-the " lost darlint, who for cer- I  tain had gone back to heaven, from whence she always knew she came; ; when the stern voice of Mr. Atherton recalled her to her duty, by-sending her to see if Sybil's hat was gone.  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7088-00000053"/> "         CCHESTNUT WOOD. It was not to be found, and now for the first time they missed Nep, and Mr. Atherton derived much comfort from the hope that the two were together. Still, not a moment was to be lost. It was growing rapidly dark, and providcd with lantern or torch lights, each one of the household even to Mrs. Giles, were soon scattered around the grounds in pursuit. The woods in every direction rang with Sybil's and Neptune's name, but no answer was returned. "To the PoLnd, but by different ways," had been Mr. Atherton's direction, and soon the lights might be seen from all points meeting there. Old Dinah, who always lay with her curtain up in front of her bed, so that when she could not sleep she might see, as she said, " the stars which carpet heaven;" to-night saw one light. after another, moving toward her house, and sud- denly filled with the idea that the great day of judgment had come, sat up in her bed-clasped her hands, and with no fear or hesitancy exclaimed, "The Son of man shall come in his glo01 and all the holy angels with him."' "Then shall he say unto them on his right hand, come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world!" But a knock from mortal hands upon her door soon disturbed these heavenly visions, and be- f she could answer, another, and another, with a violent effo Ton the part of the comer to open the door for himself, filled her with more fear than she had felt in view of the final destruction of the world. She Ilurried as fast as she  could to turn the lock, and Mr. Atherton, without waiting to ask her leave, stepped in, and looked around the room. "Sybil is not here!" le simply said. Dinah was too frighltened to answer, and Mr. Atherton, noticing her alarm, said gently, "Don't be fiightened, I have lost my little Sybil, and I thought perhaps she had strayed in here. Have you seen her to-day?   :?(-      (CIJESTTNUT AVOOD.      ,  95 - No sir, hot to-day,' said Dinah, calmed at once by his tone, and realizing what had happened. "She hasn't fallen into the pond, has she? Where is Jerry? The child is very fond of him; she may have gone. to Hymcswold after himn, and then he will bring her back as soon as she reaches  there.' "Thank you, Dinah, I shall feel mluch easier." Dinah could not think what she had done to make Mr. Atherton easier; for herself, the thought of Jerry, in case of trouble, had become second only to her reliance on a higher power, and it was natural to turn to him. Mr. Atherton having issued a-few brief directions for continuing the search in other pl ees, and feeling quite cer- tain that Sybil could not have fallen into the ind, because she never was allowed to go there without somle one with her, and without visiting Dinah-and also, because Neptune was too good a swimmer not to save her had she fallen in -started for Jerry's house. It was a long walk-but his impatience and anxiety doubled the distance; he began al- most to count his steps before Palmy's little white house came in sight. To open the gate and open the door was but the work of a moment. He forgot there was such a thing as a knocker--he Sonly remembered the lost child. Jerry and Mis' Palmy were sitting snugly around a lit- tle table. One ta1 and very white tallow candle stood be- tween them. Miss almy, with her spectacles upon the end of her nose, was busy stitching at one of those seams-the sewing of which seemed almost to have become second na- ture, and to be done about as mechanically as ladies of her age genelally use the knitting-needle. Jerry had a news- paper in his hand-it was a religious weekly-and taking, and punctually paying for it, had constituted a great part of Palmy's religion. This he used to read every evening aloud, beginning on Monday evening at the first word of the  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7088-00000054"/> 96         CHESTNUT WlOOD, first column, and ending on Sunday night at the end of the last. His "gifts were not in learning," as Jerry often said of himself-for he called his words all manner of things but what they really were; and had Miss Palmy been half as much interested in them. as in her seam, she would some- times have been sorely puzzled to find out their meaning. To-night he was in the midst of the detail of some shocking murder, when Mr. Atherton suddenly opened the door and entered. "Mercy on us!" exclaimed Palmy, dropping her work and turning as pale as a ghost. "Luddy!" said Jerry, about as much astonished as Palmy, but not quite so much frightened. When he saw who it was, his astonishment did not seem to abate. "Mr. Atherton, as I live! Well now, if I ain't beat-what's the matter at Chestnut Wood?" - Where is Sybil?" asked Mr. Atherton, with an effort to speak calmly.  "Sybil! why at home, and abed, I hope, Mr. Atherton." "No, Jerry; I returned home at dusk, and she was not there. We have all been out these two hours, and Dinal suggested that she might have come home with you." Jerry's face had undergone all manner of changes while Mr. Atherton was speaking, and after he had finished, he stood looking from him to Palmy, the perfect picture of dis- tress and perplexity; suddenly, however, his whole expres- sion changed, and shouting-" to the clearing-to the clearing" -he ran out of the house without waiting to explain his conduct.  Mr. Atherton called after him-but he might- as well have expected to shout to the winds, and receive an answer. Jerry had not thought of a lantern-of any thing but Sybil; and with such long strides did he measure the ground, that Mr. Athertoai was obliged to give up all hope of overtaking   ,.i .imtCXi5TrNUT WOOD.             97 him, and content himself with following with the best speed he could make to the clearing. Before he reached there, he met Jerry returning. She never got there," he said; "I have been over every inch of it; and called her too, but there is nothing to be seen or heard of her. Oh! Mr. Atherton, where is she ' "What made you go to the clearing, Jerry?" asked Mr. Atherton. "Why, don't you know? to be sure you don't-I never stopped to tell you, did I? Well now, about the middle of this arternoon, I was going by the house and met the child lhunting for you. She wouldn't tell me what she wanted, but she tried to coax me to carry her to you; and so I took her up and carried her home, and set her in the door, and promised to ride her away down to Dinah's to pay her for it some time, and I no more thought, nror nothing, but what she would stay there, still and good as she always is-but now I think on't, there was something in her eye which seemed to say, Jerry, you may go-but so shall I;' so-" "The matter is very plain," interrupted Mr. Atherton, the child wanted to come and meet me, and she has lost her way--she did not of course even know in what direction to go, did she?" "No, sir " answered Jerry, more promptly than usual. t A" erpe is Nep?" "Gone with her, I suppose. Both are mrissing." "Then she is safe from being hurt," said Jerry '"Better rouse the town, and have men out in all directions. .We can soon scour the country for as far as such a little thing could walk." Give direction for so doing quickly, Jerry! and to the point. Don't alarm the town-pick your men--let thou be trusty and sober, they shall not fail to be well paid-say so 4 1I to them from me."

I shall call the minister first --or perhaps you will step there yourself." -"No, Jerry, I shall return to the woods. I will not ivait for you even five minutes. Follow to the woods immlue- diately around the house; she is probably there." -Almost as soon as Mr. Atherton reached them, Jerry with his chosen menh were there also, and Mr. Atherton dis- ,-'\ tinctly heard him issuing orders in as clear and' precise a manner as he could have done himself. The men knew the woods well, much better than Mr. Atherton, and he heard the different localities portioned out with a distinctness which left himn little doubt that the child would soon be found. In a few minutes the woods seemed as if suddenly bursting into one large and instantaneous conflagration. The pine torches cast a lurid and almost fearful glare at a distance around them, and Mr. Atherton began to have fears from the fright which it might give Sybil should several or even one suddenly approach her. A rendezvous hadcl been appointed under a large oak tree, which was considered as rmarking the centre of-the woods, and here one after another of the seekers were rapidly gathering, each one hoping the other brought the child. The e was no word of exclamation or disappointment from any onl. They were a silent band that stood there awaiting further orders. To most, Sybil was an entire stranger; but there is sonlething in the word lost which tells strangely upon the feelings when it is applied to a little humnan being, and the dark night is shuttilg it still more entirely from view. "' Is there any hope left for this spot, Jerry?" asked 31r. Atherton, calmly. "None in the world," ;said Jerry; " a rabbit would hardly have hidden so as not to have been started to-night. We niAst separate for wider distances."   CHESTNUT WOOD.          99 "First," said the Rev. Mr. Rogers, who had answered promptly to this as to every other call for assistance, " let us ask God to keep the child in safety and guide us to her." Mr. Atherton made a sign of impatience, Mr. Rogers, without waiting for consent, in a few simple but) appropriate words invoked the Divine protection and blesing. * It was as mnusual an occurrence as the one which had drawn them out, but, like that, it was never forgotten by those present. The party again quietly separated-night was wearing on-the frosty air was keen, and the wind was rising in those short, fitful gusts, which indicate a coming storm; every one heard it, and knew that the life-of the child, if she should have fallen asleep, as she probably had, was be- cominng each hour more in peril. "Let us be sure as far askwe go," was Jerry's parting direction, " whistle to and call Nep often. He is somewhere with her, and will answer for her." 'What a weary night that was i! every part within what was supposed walking distance for a child was carefully searched, all with no success, and morning was beginning to dawn in Ilhe east. Daylight inspired fresh hope. Little clusters of three and four began to gather and form plans by themselves. Jerry and Mr. Atherton had completely ex- hausted all their invention, and were now more led than leading. In some way, the general direction seemed to have fallen'into Mr. Rogers' hands, and he was more used to spi- ritual than temporal guidance. It was at last determined, as a final resort, to drag the pond; and Dinah, as she rose at her usual early hour, fromn a bed whichll fears for the little lost child had made entirely sleepless, saw the men gathering upon the banks, with tyose fearful preparations, of which she had seen use made but too many times before. She did not need to ask a question, she understood it all, and taking her Bible, she drew her fin-  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7088-00000056"/> 100        CHESTNUT WOOD. ger slowly over this passage--"Qh God, be not far from me, oh my God, make haste for my help." Before th e net was cast into the water, a woman's voice was heard, calling with its utmost strength. Mister Atherton, indaad Mister Atherton-Jerry, Jerry Goldsmith, an' where is it you are. It's searching for you I've been this hour, and sure Nep has come home he'self to the house, and not a bit of a darlint child has he broufht with him, the sinner. IMay he niver go to hiven for it, niver -niver," and Margy's voice ended in a positive yell of anger. Jerry had not waited to hear her through, but strode away with the same long untiring step, with which he first started for the clearing. Nep heard him, before he reached the house, and came bounding out to meet him, with an eager bark. "Nep, where is your little mistress-where is Sybil?" Nep. answered by a short growl. "Lead the way! sir," said Jerry commandingly-"I am coming."  Nep sprang upon him, gave one loud bark, and started off, turning his head constantly for the first few steps to make sure that Jerry was following; and when he saw that he did, moving on, without turning his head again to the right or to the left. To Jerry's surprise, he passed directly through the woods which they -had first searched, over to a small patch nearly joining it, but which, in some mysterious manner, they had all forgotten. Here he bound- ed on before Jerry, too fast for Jerry to keep within sight of him, even though he exchanged his strides for a run; but Nep barked frequently, so as to serve as perfectly for a guide, as if he had kept in sight. There came then one loig loud bark of joy, and Jerry knew Sybil was found. In a moment he was on the spot. Nep's bark had just awakened her, she was rising from the ground, and rubbing her eyes with a face full of astonishment.   -,:":'     CHESTNUT WOOD.         101 Jerry caught her in his arms, and with a voice alymost loud enough to be hear4 by the borders of the pond, cried out, "Here she is-here she is." The woods echoed and re-echoed it, and the listening ear of Mr. Atherton caught it as it was dying distantly away. He could not distinguish t word; but his heart answered to the echo, "Here she is- my little Sybil is found." He reached the house at the same time that Jerry brought the child home.  Nep was walking most sedately by his side, and the child was prattling with a full, happy heart, of the beautiful- walk and the good nap she had with Nep's great face over her. The moment she saw her grand- father, she asked Jerry to put her down, and running up with the broken shell, which she had held tightly through the night, yet in her hand, she said- "Grandpapa, I am very sorry, but I did break your beautiful shell." "Dear child!"-the grandfather's heart was too full for words, and when Mr. Rogers, who had just come up, said, "Let us return thanks ;" with uncovered head, for the first time for many-many a long year, Mr.. Atherton acknow- ledged in person the existence of an ever-watchful God.    &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7088-00000057"/> CHAPTER   VIII. A FEW weeks after the events narrtd in the last chapter, and while the good people of Hymeswold were still busy ill talking over, and wondering at the possibility of a child being lost and staying out all night without harm, and Sybil and Neptune were hero and heroine, a very stylish-looking buggy, containing two gentlemen, drove up to the Rising Sun. One of these persons was apparently about thirty-five years old, a fine-looking man, with the bearing and deport- ment of a gentleman; the other was much younger, a,nd there was something in his air which was at once flashy anld tawdry. He would have been taken for the servant of the elder one, but for the easy familiarity with which he accosted ]him, and the freedom which he used in his presence. They called for a private room, and private dinner, which order rather amused mine 'host, as, excepting now and then a stray stage passenger, they were the only guests which he had had, or was likely to have for months. During the prepara- tion of dinner, the younger went out among the crowd col- lected around the door, and without joining much in the conversation, contrived to find out the name of the; prin- cipal resident of the village. Mr. Atherton was, of course, the greatest of their great men, and the loss of his grand-   -1 :-: .CHESTNUT WOOD.                  103 child, which had been the theme of their conversation before the carriage arrived, was related, with such additional cir- cumist ances as the narrator -thought would be. most likely to create an interest; and he certainly seemed to have siuc- ceeded, for the stranger asked many questions about both Mr. Atherton and the child, which met with a ready an- swer. Sybil was little less than an angel, and -Mr. Atherton not only worshipped her,- but had been heard to say, time and time again, ( that if any thing ever happened to that child, he should certainly make way with himself; for with all his wealth, life would be worth nothing without her"; so at least ran the story, and the listener seemed very willing to give credence to it a11. To his surprise, no one seemued to know the child's last name, " they had never heard her called any thing but Sybil, and as that was so outlandish, they supposed the other must be something like it." When dinner was placed upon the table, and a little bell had been put for them to ring if they should wish any thing more, the landlord retired and the strangers were alone to. getler. After a imoment's cautious observation of every part of the room, the younger rose, closed a closet door which had been left a crack open, looked from the window to assure himself it was too far front the ground to allow of eaves- droppers, and then drawing his chair closer to the elder, said in a low voice: "Brown, I have found it all out, without the least trouble; the child is here; the old man has adopted her and thinks every thing of her; she is beautiful and smart, and in every way just what we want: for once we are in the luck.'" Brown's face had undergone many changes while his comipanion was speaking, and now his only answer was an oath, with which we will not profane our pages. It was hard to tell whether it implied approbation or discontent; it   &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7088-00000058"/> 104        CHESTNUT WOOD, probably was a mixture of both; so the young man under- stood it, for he went on to say, "I don't see as we shall have to stay here at all, we will go to the place-Chestnut Wood, they call it-after dinner, anld I dare say we shall see the child playing around somc- wltere; there is no one there but the old man, herself, aiibd servants. We can see how she will do for us--and then, it she will, it's easy enough to manage the rest, you know." 1"I will tell you what," said Brown, springing up fron his chair, and speaking with much energy, " it isn't such an easy thing, Noah Billings, as you think, to take an innocent, happy child away from peace and plenty, and lead her such a life as she must lead with us; and I'll thank you to tall. sense. "' "And so will I you, Brown, and not, come with any of that'palaver, after we are fairly in for it. I can't see why the child is better now, than when you yourself made the plan in New-York to come for her-if she is, we shall have our trouble for our pains, I suppose."' "Well," said 3Brown, making a great effort to control some emotion, "I -don't know as she is-and I don't much' care what is done. It's too late," he muttered to Hiymself. "I will live now whvile I can-what matters it? 7, During the dinner-of which neither seemed inclined to partlike much-a few preliminaries were settled, and witl a cigar in his mouth, Billings sauntered out to inquire the road and distance to Chestnut Wood. Brown had sent him be- fore him, telling him that he would overtake hinm in a few moments; but, as the momnents engthenled, Billings began to feel uneasy, and was about to return, when he saw Brown with an unsteady step and flushed face coming to mneet him. He was nlot surprised; of late, Brown had iever engaged in any important business without first fortifying himself with a glass of brandy, and he had seen enough of its effects to   CHESTNUT WOOD.         105 know that they were immediate and passed quickly, leaving a dogged determination, which generally lasted until what- ever was before them to do, was done. Billings much pre- ferred this state to any other,-the changes fr m determina- tion to remorse and repentance-the flashing up of the fire that through years of sin and guilt was not yet quite ex- tinguished-was unpleasant to him. He was in momentary fear of its doing, what it sometimes had-breaking up the plot already formed. He was, therefore, very glad when he saw the condition Brown was in, as he came towards him; he felt as if, though naturally much the weaker man person- ally and mentally, he was now the stronger, and should direct matters pretty much his own way. Passing his arm through Brown's, a familiarity which he attempted for some time, but in vain, to resist-he steadied his step, and pretty soon had the satisfaction to find that it was stronger of itself; so after a short walk he with- drew his arm, Brown drew his hat down over his, face, and no one would have gathered from his appearance, that he was not perfectly sober. Neither of them seemed inclined to talk. Brown's mind was confused, a nd his thoughts only came in indistinct masses without order or connection. Billings was intent not only son the object specially before them, but with plans based upon it for the future. They were, therefore, upon Mr. 'Ath- erton's ground before they knew it, and within sight of the house. Suddenly there sprang out upon them with a growl which was almost terrific, a large dog. This they were un- prepared for, and Billings began to tremble--but Brown, with many awful oaths and imprecations, now kicked the dog, now struck at him with his large fist, and the more vio lent he became, the more frantic was the dog.  In a few minutes longer, he would probably have been severely in- jured-but just then, a little girl, with hat flying off and VOL.

"Nep--come here!" said the same childish voice--but in a very decided tone. "Come her--I am ashamed of you, sir."' Nep did not seem at all inclined to obey, but he left Brown, and standing a little distance from him kept up an uninterrupted series of deep and threatening growls. "Send away that dog, won't you, little girl?" said Bil- lings, coaxingly. "Yes, sir," said Sybil, walking forward and calling Nep after her. But Nep showed no intention of moving. He kept his eyes fixed upon the intruders, and placed himself in a most formidable attitude for attack. "That is an ugly beast of yours," said Billings, "Can't you send him home? 5' "He is not ugly; he is very good," answered Sybil; "but he is angry with you, and does not like you. You had better go away." a "Fair and easy, little girl," said Brown, starting to ap- proach Sybil-but Nep, as if he divined his object, sprang again upon him, and Brown, perfectly sobered by the severity of the attack turned around and set himself seriously to work to get free from the dog. Ire soon saw that blows only made' him more furious, and that his chance of escape was to walk quietly away,--this Billings had done as soon as he saw the dog spring the second time, and was already out of sight when Brown prepared to follow. As soon as Nep became thoroughly convinced that such was his intention, he left ,him, and contented himself with sending after him a specimen of what he should receive if he ventured there-again. When the two worthies once more joined company, it   By 4       CHESTNUT WOOD.         107 was with some slight alteration of tone and manner. Brown's profanity, as usual, seemed to serve him for a safety-valve; but Billings looked discomfited and vexed past endurance. So a dog Tyill cheat us out of her," he growled. "A mouse might cheat a coward like you out of your soul, if he should try it," angrily answered Brown. "What did you get by standing fight that time?" taunt- ingly asked Billings. "The knowledge that I am not a coward,:' said Brown. "That you are welcome to-and to the fight also, for all that I care,'5 answered Billings; (r what I want is the girl."  "And that you never shall have, while I live to prevent it," said Brown. "Poh-poh!" answered his companion. "It is bad enough without our quarrelling. What is to be done?" The question was quite to the point, and formed suffix cicnt topic for discussion while they slowly returned to the Rising Sun. When Nep became assured that the intruders had fairly gone, and had no intention of coming back, for the present at least, he turned around as quietly as if he had only been chasing a butterfly with his little mistress across the lawn, and-trotted after Sybil-who, not a little alarmed, was making all haste toward home. He overtook her before she reached home, and seemed to take as Cuite undeserved the ' Naugh- ty--naughty Nep,)' with which she received him.- The two told the story to Mr. Atherton-Sybil with her silver voice and excited face, and Nep with his lopping ears, panting sides, and half-shut eyes. There was something about it which disturbed Mr. Atherton.  He was a great believer-in the unfailing instincts of the canine race, and the unusual antipathy shown by Neptune he knew could not be without a cause.  He thought over every enemy whom he  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7088-00000060"/> 108        CHESTNUT WOOD. might be likely to have in the world., He had always been a strictly ho: est and honorable man; and so, in the dealings of his life, he could think of but one lwho would be likely to consider him in this light. Over that one he held the dread of the execution the law's severest penalties, and of him, therefore, he ha no fear. Yet it was with difficulty he dis. missed the mnafter from his mind, andihe found himself for several nights after the occurrence, seeing to the secure fastening of the house. But, alas! a dearer treaure than all the silver or gold was threatened, and of this he never even so much as dreamed.  Fortunately, however, Sybil had become so much alarmed by the unexpected combat which she had seen, that she did not like to venture far from home. She contented herself with playing in the gar- den, or going with Jerry to superintend the work; but nothing could persuade her to take Nep with them. She always made sure that he was safely shut up in the library before starting, and if he got out and followed them, she would rather return with him than stay. Jerry laughed at her, and almost scolded her for what he considered a foolish whim; and Mr. Atherton regretted it much, as removing a safeguard in which he had always felt the greatest confidence when the child was away from him. About a week after the first visit of the strangers to Chestnut Wood, Sybil, without;being conscious of it, strolled away in her play toward the gate which separated the woods directly around thi house from the rest. While she was busy building fences of little twigs, as she had seen Jerry do of large limbs, she heard her voice called by a child. She looked around in every direction, but not a person was to be seen-and she was beginning her quiet play again when she heiird, "Sybil-Sybil Thornton, don't you knovr me?  "No," said Sybil, throwing down the bushes and run- b   CHESTNUT WOOD.        109 ning out into the path. "I don't see you-I don't know who is calling me. Where are you?" "Here!" answered the same voice,-and she heard a, rattling at the gate. Running up to it she saw a little boy, gray with dust, with very red cheeks, and very black eyes, and close curling dark hair. He smiled a pleasant smile as she attempted to open the gate for him to come in-but he held it quite tightly on the outside, and said, "No, I can't stop to come in. I must be back to Charl- ton to-night. I only came to see you a moment. You know you said I must not forget you, and I wanted to show you that I had not." "Charles-dear Charlie," said Sybil, now recognizing him, and jumping up and down in perfect glee, " you must come, for I am all alone, and want some one to play with. Where is Mamma Wallace, and Jemmy, and little Joe,- didn't they cone with you?" ' No," said Charles, "I came alone, and no one knows it--so, Sybil, I must hurry back-that is, I didn't 'tell mother-but I told John Watson, and told him if I was not back by dinner-time, he must go in and tell mother, so she would not be troubled about me." "Oh, it's long, long past dinner-time," said Sybil. : I am ,so glad to see you. Come, you must never leave me again." The delighted boy no longer resisted the opening of the gate; coming in, he stopped, and began to brush off the dust, and said: "I know it's after dinner. Why, Sybil, thirty miles is much further that I thought it was; I have been two days. getting here."  "Two days! why Charlie," said Sybil, "isn't that a long time? How tired and hungry you must be." "Yes, but I don't care any thing for that. You see, Sy-  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7088-00000061"/> 8        -.

And I have' always meant since that day I walked to meet you in the stage, and you did not come?, to see you before you grew old and would not know me, and so I have done it-have not I, Sybil?  Sybil's happy face looked as if she thought he had done that, and a great deal more, and so she began to help him to shake off the dust, and by the time Jerry came up, Charles was quite in trim. : Halloo!" he said, as he saw two children,! who have we here?" "Why it is Charles Wallace-don't you know him, Jer- ry? said Sybil, running up to him. " Charles Wallace---and who is Charles Wallace, I should like to hear?" ' Mamma Wallace's boy, that I loved so much, and that was always kind to me when I lived at Charlton." "Well now, I never! How did you get here, Charlie?" "Walked," said Charles, half timidly. \' You're a man, every inch of you," said Jerry, survey- ing the handsome boy with much satisfaction. "Did your marm know you came?" Sybil hung her head, but seemed to feel quite relieved when Charles told the truth, ' I say, for't," exclaimed Jerry, " if that ain't a story that's worth the telling. Ain't you kind of hungry, Charlie?" "I shall do very well, answered Charles, until I am home again." "You're a smart one-how old are you, sir?" "Nearly eleven." "Bless me! I have known boys twice your age without half your spunk; when I was older than you are, I remem- ber crying like a big baby because I was hungry." if   ',,S      CI ESTNUT WOOD.        1" "But you would not now, would you? asked Charles. "Bless my heart, I don't know; it's a terrible feeling to have your stomach a asking away arter something, and not get it. Haven't you had any thing since you started?" "Two crackers, and as many apples as I wanted."  i Now, wouldn't a piece of bread and butter taste proper good? or say a doughnut, or a piece of pie-hey, Charlie? ' "Yes," said Charlie unhesitatingly; " but I can manage until I get home." - "You're, a proper nice boy, and you shall have a meal,  if I can beg, or borrow, or buy one foi you; so come along, Charlie-dinner first and play afterwards." The little fellow was sorely tempted, for indeed he was very hungry ; but was on the point of refusing, fearing it would separate him from Sybil, when she held out her hand to go with him, and he gladly consented. As the party started to go toward Chestnut Wood, two men, who had some time since stealthily approached, and been keeping watch of all Sybil's movements, from behind a clus- ter of trees near her, moved carefully away, but in an op-' p0site direction. A little distance from the gate, but so as not to be seen by a passer by, was fastened in the road the horse and buggy, which about a week before had stopped at the Rising Sun. As the two seated themselves in it, Billings gave utter- ance to curses both deep and loud; but in Brown's face there was almost an expression of pleasure; and certainly there was something very taunting in the tone in which he said,   - "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. You're a great kidnapper, Billings; I advise you to go to Africa, you would soon make your fortune there." "Not if I had you along," growled Billings.

Brown laughed-a coarse insulting laugh--but made no answer, and Billings, having by a furtive glance at his  face, assured himself that he was in no mood to be trifled with, wisely restrained the chagrin which his being twice foiled in an 'attempt had natturally occasioned; and so they drove away from Hymeswold in silence.

JERRY was not a little puzzled when he reached the house, to know whether he should take Charles in at the front door, and introduce him as company, or around to the kitchen, and after having a comfortable meal provided for him there, send him directly home. Charles's clothes certainly indica- ted-perhaps not poverty-but small means, and much care; still, there was something it the bearing of the boy, and in his handsome face, which was a better coat of arms than could be found in any volime of heraldic devices. Jerry did by no means feel certain what to do. He would not displease Mr. Atherton, in such a matter, neither would he for the world hurt the little fellow's feelings; but while he was debating with himself, in somewhat of a quandary, Sybil easily decided it, by bounding without waiting either for Charles or himself, into the front door, and bursting open that of the Library, called to her grandfather, who was sit- ting there quietly reading, Grandpapa!  grandpapa!  Charles Wallace  has come!  A cloud passed over Mr. Atherton's face. He had wished and meant after the handsome sum of money which he sent Mrs. Wallace, soon after Sybil came to him, to forget the existence of such a family; particularly, as with what he   &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7088-00000063"/> 1 14        CHESTNUT WOOD. thought arrogant pride, the money had been returned to him untouched. But before he had time to say one word ex- pressive of displeasure, Jerry appeared leading in the boy, who removed his cap, made his bow, and stood looking at him with so much childish wonder in his face, that he was  quite disarmed. "Where did you find that boy, Jerry?" he asked in a  , kinder tone than Jerry had ventured to expect.. He there-  fore was not slow in telling the whole story, and i reply to t it, Mr. Atherton only said,. And, Charles Wallace, you are a boy that speaks the  truth?" "I wouldn't be afraid to take an oath on't," said Jerry, without waiting for Charles to speak.  ( Let the boy speak for himself," said Mr. Atherton, i g somewhat sternly.  "I have been flogged for telling the truth twice, sir,"  said Charles, looking boldly up in Mr. Atherton's face, "but never once for a. lie."                 e. That are was too bad, now, wan't it though?" interrupt-  -ed Jerry again.-  "Well, suppose," said Mr. Atherton, without noticing  Jerry, " that I think you are deceiving me, and saying you walked when you know you came down in the stage; and beside, have had your breakfast, dinner and tea, ever since you left hdce; so I tell Jerry there, to ,take you and give you a hard whipping, and send you back." Sybil moved from her grandfather's knee, and going close up to Charles, took his hand, but did not say a word. The boy looked from Mr. Atherton to Jerry for amo- ment without speaking, then tightening his hold of Sybil's hand, and drawing himself up, he .said, "You must whip me, if you please, sir, it will be the third time for speaking only the truth."    CHESTNUT WOOD.         115 Mr. Atherton lookd at him in silence-he was pleased, but not yet convinced. The boy's eye did not quail before his, the child felt insulted, and his notle nature was roused, as is seldom the case with so young a child. "Suppose flien," at last said Mr. Atherton, slowly, so as to intimidate Charles if possible, " suppose I do not have you whipped, but make sure that' you walk back without eating (a norsel."  "It is what I mean to do, said the boy. I only came to see Sybil, not to stay. I have seen her, and now I will go, without being sent." He threw his arms around Sybil's neck, who stood motionless as a little statue; then, with a polite bow to Mr. Atherton, walked to the door. \ Jerry's face turned all manner of colors. . The restraint rwhich his habitual respect for Mr. Atherton imposed upon him, was fast wearing bff, when he saw a smile begin to play upon his master's lip. "All is safe," he whispered to him- self, " but I would rather stand a whole militia than him when he gets a searching up that truth matter; but Charlie has saved himself this time," and Jerry was right.  "Don't be in a hurry, my little man," said Mr. Atherton, in a changed and very kind manner; "come here." Charles stopped, but his eye was bright, and there was a red spot upon both of his cheeks. "Come," said Mr. Atherton, still more kindly, holding out his hand to him, "forget and forgive. Those who have Sybil's grandfather for a friend, must prove themselves of good metal." The boy did not wholly understand the words, but he did the look and tore, and he was quicker to forgive, than to take offence. Sybil too was again at his side, and ws leading him to her grandfather. Mr. Atherton took the child's hand, and looked him steadily in the face: "If I like you as well at the end of a month," he kaid, "I will make a man of you."  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7088-00000064"/> 1 16        CHESTNUT WOOD.  "That I will do for ysf, if I live, sir,' said Charles  iquickly.  Yes, sartain as the world," said Jerry, who was drink- ing in the scene in infinite delight, " you'll make your own way, or I'll lose my guess." "Well, we will see about the present then,"' sai'd Mr. . Atherton with a smil i "and first comes a dinner ell, boy." "Sartain," said lerry for him, " he must be e'eny jist fainting away now, for want of food, poor boy. I'd cry if I  were he, H know I would." "Then you would spoil your dinner, and not act half as much like a man as Charles does. Ring the bell and order dinner, then go to the Rising Sun-or stop, I will send'a few lines by you. The boy must remain here for the present." ' Mr. Atherton in his intention to keep Charles Wallace  for a short time as a member of his family, was acting n6t so much frorm present impulse, as from plans which he had been slowly maturing. He had always accustomed himself to viewing the pre- sent as only a stepping-stone to the future, and perhaps to this was owing, in. a great part, the success which had at-  tended his efforts to acquire wealth. To-morrow never was   sacrificed for to-day; and so with him life had no actual, 4 living present. The outlines of the coming future, which to others were dim and indistinct, to him had not only form  and featurethut bone and sinew, yes, even the throbbing pulse and beating heart. He met and grappled with it, as if it  were an armed giant, who must be conquered or would con-' quer; but this is the natural course taken by a strong mind and a weak faith. Intellectually, he felt the necessity for a superintending guiding hand in the unknown events before him, but his mind recognized no God, rested upon no firmer foundatidns than its own unaided powers. His hand bent the bow, and by the strength of his own right arm, guided I   , ,    Ct llEJ lTNUT WOOD.      117 by an unerring eye, he sent the arrow quivering to the mark. TI-e had not reached the years which he had now numbered, without being taught a different lesson, but he had never learned it; he considered himself thwarted only from the misconduct of others, not from any course of events which he could have foreseen, or controlled if he had. It had now been for some months becoming certain, that Sybil was in a fair way to be spoiled. Her naturally impe- rious, though sweet temper, had no one to oppose it. Every thing both in and out of the house was ordered as she-wish- ed; even old Nep had learned to give up his will to hers, and Jerry was fast becomipgt a perfect slave to all her little caprices. Her grandfather was the only person to whom she yielded at all, and even to him she would at times have. offered resistance, if she could have hidden her face so as not to encounter his eye. A few mornings before Charles's visit, he had been the unknown witness to a scene which had fully determined him in the conviction, that no time was to be lost in procuring a companion for Sybil. He was passing through the hall, when the sound of loud voices in Sybil's room attracted his attention, and caused him to stop to listen to what was going on. Mrs. Giles was finding fault with Margy in no very measured terms, for some omission of duty, and Margy was pleading and crying by turns, in a regular fit of Irish ex- citement and pugilism. Suddenly a little foot came down upon the floor with as much character and decision as ever  ' the grandfather himself had shown, and he heard Sybil say in angry tones, "Mrs. Giles, stop your noise! Margy sAzall do as she has a mind to, and you scold her if you dare. She is kind to me, and I love her a great deal better than I do you.  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7088-00000065"/> "8        CHESTNUT WOOD. She shall have clust when she pleases, and you may let her alone." Hoity toity, Miss Sybil!" said Mrs. Giles, in an astonished and rather confused tone. ' That is a pretty way for a little lady like you to be talking-and to be taking the part too of a slovenly servant girl. I should like to know what your grandfather will say when Itell him , " "I can tell you what he will say," answered Sybil, her voice growing sharp and angry. "He e-ill say-Margy is not a slovenly servant girl, but you are a cross old house- keeper, and he will send you away. I will tease him very hard to, and get some one who is not always scold-scdld- scold, from morning to night; and I will go this minute and beg hi-m, and then, dear Margy, you shall be happy, and leave the dust just where you fancy." She started to go, but Mrs. Giles caught her by her dress and stopped her, and Mr. Atherton, to his utter as- tonishment, heard blows quick and hard follow. "O1h, fie! for shame, Miss Sybil!" said Mrs. Giles, " to strike a poor old woman like me ;" and then came sobs as from some one whose feelings were deeply hurt.  There was silence for a moment. Mr. Atherton almost felt as if his life hung upon the next movement. It was as he  hoped. Sybil flung her arms around Mrs. Giles's neck, andcl  sobbing as if her heart was broken, pleaded for forgiveness,? with- many promises inever to do such a thing again. Probably the forgiveness was not very ,graciously given, li for the combatants separated almost immediately,'and M!r. Atherton went to his library to forml plans for the future. ; It was the day after tHiis occurrence that Charles Wal- ii lace made his appearance, and the grandfather resolved to keep him at the Wood for a few weeks, and watch what effect company had upon Sybil.

Something  of this necessity had been foreseen and sug- gested by Jerry to Mr. Atherton on the first night of Sybil's coning home, and had formnned even then the s abjet of their consultation after the child had beenlcarried away to bed; so Mr. Atherton, with his usual reliance upon Jerry's fore- thought, had hopes of findingsolne kind of a plall already formed-th cough e had no expectation of its being one in which he could conur without many important changes. He now sent for Jerry ,and waited rather inpatiently for is coming. Jerry was at work at some distane fron' the house, and  was somewhat       stace o   the lse, what sulprised, and not altogether pleased, to be summloned away; but le knew there was no doubting nor deferring an order received from head-quarters and so ame leisurely to the library.

Mr. Atherton was not mistaken.

We must do Jerry, and {Miss Fitch also, the credit to state, that they had thought as much of othelrs as of either Mr. Atherton or the petted Sybil; but we nmust for once tell the story ourselves, and not allow Jerry tlhe privilege. Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, the minister and minister's wife of the little parish of Hymeswold, were altogether peculiar people. He had worked his way up, first from the plough, where he ran the furrows crooked that he 'might read his book while he drove the horse, and was dismissed, as good for nothing, to a store, where he attended more faithfully to his business-but spellt every spare minute behind the counter busy with the Latin lesson which was to fit him for college. Then, having saved a little money, he went to the ) academy, and then to teaching a district school, until at last -/ the great bourne was reached, and he was enrolled a member ' of a New England College.  Good principles, correct habits, and a faithful performance of duty, with orly a tolerable modicum of talent, carried him through, and even sent him i with considerable reputation to join a theological school-- j from which he went forth amply qualified for the duties and j  responsibilities of a small,"country congregation. During  the last year of his preparatory course, he had wooed and won i-i3 the affections of a young lady remarkable for a certain odd- 'i ness and quaintness of character, and for very little besides. c If there were any accounting for such matters, it xwould have astonished every one that either should have preferred the other; but as there is not, all their mutual friends soon became accustomed to the matter, and ceased regarding it even as a joke.

Altogether, he looled like a man who was just fadtin out from life, as a magic-lantern piture disappears fom  caun- vas, or. like a daguerreotype which is s  oigh as to be hardly distinguishabl         so   as to be Irs.

I that is after all the only true basis of happiness in a married . . "fe; so she left her position in a rather dependent situatio i in the city, and moved, as the millister's wife, into the little town of Hymeswold.                      : Years passed quickly by--the salary was small, and poorly paid. They were hospitable, generous people, and to make the ends of the year meet in a manner becoming the  , station they occupied, it became necessary, first, thallt r. Rogers should shorten the study hours, and increase tle time spent in cultivating the little farm attached to. the par sonage; then, that the servant should be dismissed, and husband and wife both should fill that place; and finally, when after ten years of a childless life, a. little girl madehr e appearance, she was hailed both as a blessing and an il- cumbrance. Their ways of life were all now stereotyped  so were their habits of thought and feeling. The minister had not studied for years; he had hardly lived on what hie  had previously acquired-his mind, like his purse, was in a very empty condition, and neither seemed likely to be filled by this unexpected addition to their family. The child  proved feeble-so did the mnother. A wet nurse must be cm-  I ployed; (ad ir. Roers felt as if expenses were grow^i  beyond the means of ever being met. If just at this period of his life some one had whispered to him, that less of the kitchen and the cradle, and more of the study was the best way to improve affairs, it might have saved him--but no one did, and either himself or wife were the last persons in the  world to find it out. So he went on, year after year, ulntil his mind, instead of being filled up with theology, bcame e stored with the price of flour, butter, wood, and all the ne-  cessities of life-and the useful duties, which he still con- ! tinued to perform, vcre more haJbits thlan living acts of faith 3 and hope.  Of course, the lethargy of his own soul spread itself over X Xi   CHESTNUT WOOD.        123 the people, and Hymeswold was indulging in a spiritual nap, as deep as it had been long and dreamless. Yet all the people were much attached both to the minister and his wife. he was emphatically  a peacemaker, and never disturbed them on account of his small salary and poor pay. Yet he klept all the outward obscrvatccs of religioh in full play, and as 1ie was retiring  in disposition, they llad never yet been ashamed of him in public. There had been a report current among them, when he was first settled, that he had talent; and they supposed he had it still, whenever they should be at the pains to draw it out. Irs. Rogers was active and 'energetic among them ; in fact, drove them about as a good shepherd's wife is often seen to a flock of her husband's- sheep-not by going behind them and forcing them  on with the whip and the voice, but by go- ing before with a full dish of golden corn,-and as she rat- tled it with much noise, calling them in the most:winning manner to follow/after her: so Mrs. Rogers had her sewing societies, in which, as president, she set before the ladies the prizes to be gained by faithfulness and industry at their gatherings; or the prayer-meeting, in which she more than anlly one, managed to keep alive what remained of the vital spark within the mother's heart. Take them together, all the harm they did was the negative one-of not doing any good., The child-they called her Matilda, after -her great grandmother--grew at last, and became strong and well- even perhaps a little more hearty than other children. Mr. Rogers said it was " through the kindness of his Heav- enly Father.:' Mrs. Rogers feelingly averred, "It was that and her excellent nurse/" and so, in quiet thankfulness,! tile matter reste.  As might have been foretold, from the character of the parents, little IMattie possessed no ordinary traits.

She was a lively, thoughtless child, with naturally a good mind, but too much indolence. of disposition ever to use the'talents given her. Sometimes she would astonish her friends by a smart answer, or ready acquisition of know- ledge-but, as a general thing, she laughed and talked and grew, a specimen of good, hearty, physical development-- and for moral or mental traits, attracting no observation. So long as she was well and happy, the parents were con- tent; and Mattie would have stood a fair chance to have seen childhood bud into girlhood, and girlhood blossom into, womanhood, without more care than is commonly bestowed on a pet domestic animal, had not a visit from a spinster sister of her father's, fortunately for her, changed a little tile current of affairs. Miss Mary Rogers had reached the age of forty-five, with that rarest of all traits for one who had led a depend- ent life-an unsoured heart. The world had never been a play-room to her. She had been continually -surrounded by necessities, either actually existing, or called into life by her own turn of mind. She had warm affections-could love-and did love, with ardor; and if Aunt Mary had belonged to the class of those who prattle a good deal of their own feeling, she would many times had made the knowledge of hidden tears public, aind then, perhaps, she would have thrown around her maiden life some sentimental charm which was now wholly wanting. , No one thought of her but as a person who was willing to do ;&amp; all the good she could, and to whom it was a charity to ta afford every opportunity. So. no one was ever sick, or in e! trouble, in the town where she was, but a messenger was' H sent at once to inform her--and to her credit be it said, tlce : story was never told in vain. If our good deeds are written g ,.q   ^i   I   ^  /NK CHESTNUT WOOD.        125 for us in that eventful book, the knowledge of whose pages may never be ours here, certainly it would seem that against Aunt Mary's name must be found a long list of suffering alleviated., sorrow conforted, mourning with those that ' mourned, and rejoicing with those whho rejoiced, and all in so quiet and unassuming a manner that the actor was for- gotten in the action. She had, so far in his married life, had very little to do with her brother.  She felt that he had enough of energy and companionship in his wife, and that in their household she could not be needed to perform the  little acts of service with which she endeavored to prevent her presence being a burthen in other families,-but now, changes with the friends where she had spent three quiet and happy years, perhaps the most so of any since her young life, made it necessary that she should seek a new home- and a letter from Mrs. Rogers kindly and pressingly invited her to Hymeswold. Mattie had reached her tenth year, and had never seen Aunt Mary enough to have learned to love her, but was. childlike, very much pleased at the idea of hatving a new inmate in their quiet house. She was fillaed with plans for a week previous to her coming, and certainly no state arrival ever caused greater preparations than hers in the little par- sonage. The second-best chamber was carefully put in order, and Mattie, for days before the appointed one of Aunt Mary's coming, used to go with her duster and .remove every grains of dust which had dared deposit itself on the shining furni- ture. It was a chill, gray, autumn day; when the lumbering coach stopped at the door; and Miss Rogcrs had really ar- rived. The dead leaves whirled in little eddies around her feet as she stepped from the carriage-but she would not rush even then, so stooping, she removed them carefully,   &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7088-00000069"/> 126        CHESTNUT WOOD. before she looked up, to return the kiss and embrace of the b half-wild child, who had sprung from the house, and was clinging about her. But, delighted as she was, Mattie saw the act, and had many wondering questions to ask about it in the future. Aunt Mary soon became domesticated in Hymeswold. If she was to have no home of her own, she had long since resolved to go through life neither wailing the loss nor un- happy in consequence; in her own quiet way she had dis- covered that there is no surer means to keep the heart aching and restless than'to assume the outer show of happi- ness, and really not feel so,-therefore, excepting the tears of which I have spoken over the scaled fountain, that she knew might have welled up strong, pure, and deep, she smiled because she was happy, and interested herself as much in the people and the parish, and particularly in little Mattic, as if they had belonged to her alone. Mattie, she soon found, was as untrained and unformed as the kitten that she so constantly held in her arms; and perhaps it was not unpleasant to Aunt Mary to find here' a real object of want within the sanctity of her own home. Of the child's affections, she was sure; so was she of the parents' consent to her taking the full charge of her; and therefore she had not been a fortnight at the parsonage before she colmmenced a regular process of teaching for body, mind, and heart. Mattic was a difficult, but never a refractory pupil. She did not learn fast or Thoroughly; she showed that want of early training which, unless in cases of peculiar talent, 0no after teaching can ever fully supply. Aunt Mary often put  away the books with a sigh, and the conclusion that Mattic' i character would never have any depth,-still she was pleased  to see the child improving in lmany little habits which would  be essetial to her growing up to be a lady--and that Aunt k Mary's refined taste had long since destined her to be. :   The good people of Hymeswold were astonished at the change which was wrought in the external appearance of the child, and it was a constant subject of declamation with Miss 1Paliny Fitch, and of assertion, that "Miss Rogers would certainly be the making, of that child." So often had she reiterated it in Jerry's hearing that he had come to be quite of the opinion that nobody in the world could be equal to Miss Rogers in " bringing up a gal ;" so after due consulta- tion with Miss Palmy, he held himiself ready to name her to Mr. Atherton whenever his opinion on the point was re- quested. He was, therefore, prompt in his answer when the time came-and fortunately, it seemed rather to please Mr, Atherton, so that he resolved to lose no time in seeing and conversing with Miss Rogers relative to it, determining to make up his mind with regard to her character from his own personal observation, trusting to no one. - It would seem rather strange, but it was nevertheless a fact, that in the weak points of Mr. and. Mrs. Rogers's char- acter, there had gradually taken place an assimilation very like to that which is said to take place in the features after many years of wedded life. They had conle from the anti- podes nearer and nearer together, until all the rough edges had worn off, and they had mingled into one. As a philo- sophical fact, this was not to be wondered at; but to those / whlo had known them both in early life, and who th6ughtt little of the matter, it was an object of considerable specula- tion. In one thing perhaps, nmore than in any other, they perfectly harmonized,-it was a veneration for earthly great- nless, whether it came in the form of wealth, station, or famlily, it mattered not, only so the .position was above the common walk. That this was rather irreverent to their professional oc- cupation, it must be acknowledged; but, alas! they were not free from all the stains of humanity-and this was among  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7088-00000070"/> 128         CHESTNUT WOOD. their weaknesses. Chestnut Wood, and the great, rich nan that lived there, had long been an object of intense interest and veneration to them,-but as M3r. Atherton never wment to church, and never mingled with the inhabitants of Hymrnc.- wold, they had no excuse for intruding thleir acquaintatnce upon him, The occasion of Sybil's being lost, was thie o:.ly one on which 3tr. Rogers had ever been seen to speak to M1r. Atherton; and the kindness done him then had been so fully repaid by costly presents, that even that had not opened the closed door of Chestnut Wood., When Mr. Rogers called to inquire for the child, and return thanks for the gifts, Mr. Atherton was not at home-and he never ventured to go again. Great, therefore, was their astonishment when, on thle morning after Mr. Atherton's conversation with Jerry, Mattie came bounding into the house, and said that the man who lived at Chestnut Wood had opened their gate, and was coming up the walk to the front door. Mrs. Rogers dropped the cloth with which she was busy scouring the already white kitchen table, and flew to the study in which, for a -wonder, Mr. Rogers happened to be. She commenced tugging at the collar of the very old coat which, for econoimy's sake, he wore in the house, at the same time saying, "Brush- your hair, husband, (hick! quick! You must go to tlec door. Wait upon him right into the parlor--mind, the parlor-not the sitting-room." Thus suddenly attacked, TMr. Rogers rolled his pale blue eye with an odd mixture of alarm and astonishment painted in it. "Why, wife! wife!" said he, without mov- ingl, what is the mattcer-are you crazy? 7 "There, I told you so," answered his wife, the front knocker having at that moment fallen withll considerable noise, " and you haven't this old coat off yet." The knock was a language Mr. Rogers coimprehended-   CHESTNUT WOOD.          129 though he could not his wife; so he began in earnest, though considerably agitated by her evident excitement, to make the needed toilet preparation. But in their mutual haste, every thing went wrong. Mrs. Rogers held the coat, and Mr. Rogers tried much longer to find the sleeve than it would have taken him to put on his whole wardrobe by himself; and when at last he was fairly shaken down into the garment, the knocker had called again and Aunt Mary's quiet step was heard approaching the door. "There!" said- Mrs. Rogers again, in a tone of much disappointment; "I wanted you to go, and do the manners properly.  "Mary will do better," answered Mr. Rogers, apparently n much relieved ; ' but who is it?" "Why! Mr. Atherton, don't you know!" "I don't know, how should I? you have never told me before," and Mr. Rogers put the finishing touch to his erect lock of hair and started for the parlor; but as he opened the study door, he was somewhat chagrined to find the call intended not for himself but only for his sister. Mrs Ro- gers was, as she herself said, in fits;" she did her best to persuade her husband that he should go down to see that every thing was done properly, but he had too distinct a re- membrance of Mr. Atherton's .stern eye' to care to go un- asked. The call was long-very long it seemed to' the minister and his wife, and nothingut the large black eyes of little Mattie, looking inquiringly at them, prevented some visible exhibition of their curiosity, in the shape of ears applied to the keyhole or a peep through it. At length it was ended, and Mrs. Rogers opened the sitting-room door, as Mr. Ath- erton did that of the parlor; a slight bow was all the attention she received, and so solemn and grave did he look, that even  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7088-00000071"/> 130        CHESTNUT WOOD. her bold heart quailed before:!hin; and she saw him go out and close the outer door after him. Of' course, Aunt Mary was immediately besieged with questions, and fortunately for them, she had no desire to, keep them a minute in sus- pense. She spoke so quietly that it proved like pouring oil upon the fire of their excited feelings; but her mind was so fully occupied, that for once she was rather unmindful of others. "Mr. Atherton had called to converse with her about coming to Chestnut Wood, to take the charge of a little orphan granddaughter of his." ' The one that was lost?" interrupted Mr. Rogers, "I saw---- "Don't interrupt, husband," said Mrs. Rogers, whose curiosity was too alive to brook a moment's delay. No, my dear-I was only saying--- , a "Well, don't say; I want to hear Mary." '-3iss Rogers went on-- I told him I already had the care of one little girl," looking kindly at Mattie, " and I loved her so much I should not like to leave her;" the child put her arms around her aunt's neck and kissed her very audibly. "You didn't-did you?" said Mrs. Rogers, absolutely turning pale. "Yes, I'did," answered Aunt Mary, still more quietly; "but he said that was so much greater reason for wishing me to come, for Sybil needed a companion quite as much as a teacher, and I might bring Mattie with me." "Oh, the goodness of our Heavenly Father!" ejaculated  Mrs. Rogers, fervently. "Yes," answered Mr. Rogers, closing his eyes. A smile played for a moment around Aunt Mary's mouth, but she easily controlled it, and seemed waiting for the ex- pression of some more decided opinion. "What else, Mary?" asked Mrs. Rogers.    CHESTNUT WOOD.               131 "Nothing of consequence; we talked much about chil- dren, and edfcation in general, and he told me of Sybil's character." "And what did you decide?" "Nothing; the child is to be sent here this afternoon to see if we take at all to each other," said Aunt Mary, smiling, "if not, why that will decide the matter of itself, I sup- This vey afternoon" sad Mattie, her whole face '"This veoy afternoon?'" said 1lattie, her whole face radiant with delight, " what a play we will have!" "Now, Matilda Rogers," said her mother, in a most decided tone, "you needn't be for getting up any of your pranks, for that child is a little lady, and she is as rich as Croesus." Mattie wondered who Croesus could be, and where he lived, but she looked soberly, and she said nothing. Aunt Mary saw it, and drawing the child, whispered " that if she was only good and quiet, Sybil she knew would love her, for riches made no difference when one was kind; " but a shadow had fallen on the child's heart, and was not to be so easily removed. '"You have forgotten, Mary," said Mr. Rogers, " to men- tion what he will pay you, that is, what your salary is to be, and whether you are to board there or here." "Oh, I shall stay theie, of course, and we made no other definite arrangements. It is not settled yet that I go, you know. Nothing would induce me to if the child has been, as I am afraid she has, thoroughly spoiled." "Wonderful! It is wonderful! there, now, husband," suddenly exclaimed- Mrs. Rogers, waking up as from  a deep reverie, "how the Lord opens the door for us. If Mary hadn't come here to live with us, it might have been years before we got entrance into Chestnut Wood, and here now it is just the same as if we were to be one family; I declare it is surprising; and who knows but you may reach his, Mr.   &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7088-00000072"/> 132        CHESTNUT WOOD. Atherton's heart, I mean-and he may become a good man, and go to mccting, and in the end be one of our people." It may be, the Lord only knows," answered Mr. Rogers fervently, "I am sure I hope so." What an event for the parsonage! how each one in their different way, thought and dreamed over it for the rest of the day. Mr. Rogers saw sitting before him in No. 3, directly before the pulpit, the tall dignified figure he had so often wished there; and unknown even to himself, simple- hearted man as he was, he was preaching and praying at him through the day. Mrs. Rogers bought a new carpet, a shawl for herself, a hat for Mattie, and even ventured so far as a new sack for the iiinister, on the strength of the imaginary increase of salary; that is, she purchased these also in imagination; she was far too prudent to do so in reality. Aunt Mary was very thoughtful, and although the feel- ing of her heart found no expression in words, yet there was there much of silent thankfulness and hope, that at last, in His own good time, God had given her an object of affection, one, that it was right-it was her duty that she should cher- ish, and upon whom'she should lavish her garnered trea- sures. Mattie, half in anger and half in joy, arranged her little play-house; put the best dresses upon her rag dolls, and even had the liberty to take down to play vith that box of minia- ture china tea-cups and saucers, the more prized because so seldom enjoyed. It was a long morning at the parsonage, but like all other seasons it came to an end; a bright fire was kindled in the parlor, the toys duly arranged, and all the fanmily slth down to await the visitor. There they sat, looking and listening, for two hours. kometimes expecting to see a carriage and four white horses   CHESTNUT WOOD.        133 come dashing up the road, and then again, perhaps only an elegant buggy, with black driver, and a little child all clad in velvet and glistening with gold; so they were hardly inclined to recognize Jerry Goldsmith, as he was seen to turn from the street to their door, holding by her hand a little girl about Mattie's age, and quite as simply dressed. "Now, who can Miss Palmy Fitch have sent here?" said Mrs. Rogers, in a not very hospitable tone. "It's Sybil Thornton, I see her long curls," whispered Mattie. "May I run to the door?" ' Yes, my dear," said Aunt Mary, without waiting for the mother's permission-" run quickly." The child flew to the door, and down the steps, but stopped short as she came near Sybil. "Ah, Mattie, how are you," said Jerry, holding out his great hand to the child. "Here's your little playmate come to see you. Come and kiss her, and tell her you are glad to see her." The child stepped slowly forward, but Sybil, dropping Jerry's hand, sprang to her, and putting both arms around lMattie's neck, kissed her repeatedly. "She is affectionate at least," said Aunt Mary to herself. "That's good," said Mrs. Rogers aloud; " what a darling child-I love her already." The little girls came into the house with their arms lovingly around each other's necks, as if they had always been acquainted, and were very dear friends, and in a few minutes Sybil was as much at home and as happy as if she had been adopted into the family. It was in vain for Aunt Mary to seek any serious conversation with her; she might as well attempted to have caught a butterfly and tamed it to study books, as to draw one thought or look from the child, so fully wrapped up was she in her new plays and friends. That she was beautiful, one glance Was enough to show; that her dis-  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7088-00000073"/> 134        CHESTNUT WOOD, position was sweet but spirited, the soft yet energetic lan- " guage with which she addressed her dolls fully told; and as Aunt Mary with anxious eyes followed her from sport to sport, she became convinced that there, if not in Mattie, she should find a deep rich soil wherein to sow costly seeds. Jerry had staid long enough to see that affairs were going as he wished, then left, promising to call at dusk to take Sybil home; nor could any entreaties of Mrs. Rogers that the child might be permitted to stay to tea, prevail upon him to deviate in the slightest from )Mr. Atherton's- commands. "Come here, Sybil," said Miss Rogers, as it began to grow late, "come, and sit in my lap a little while; I want to talk with you." The child dropped the plaything she lheld in her hand and immediately obeyed. Aunt Mary put the long curls off her face, and kissing her affectionately, said, "Now tell me if you should like to be a good little girl, and study books, and learn to sew, and write, and a great many other useful things?" Sybil looked in her face a moment, aind then said, "I would rather play with Ma ttie, or Charlie, or old Nep." '"But you would like to play, and learn to be useful to, would you not?" "I had rather play. Mrs. Giles scolds me when she tries to make me sew, and all my picture books I have read'through many times." "If I were to come to Chesnut Wood, and bring Mat- tie with le, do you think you should be happy shut up some- times in a school-room with us, without playing? ' Sybil hesitated: "I should love dearly to have Mattie come," then she rolled her large eyes upon Aunt Mary, with- out any further answer. "Well, perihaps somle day I shall come and bring Mat- tie, but I do not know yet. Did you ever hear the story of   A' CHESTNtiT WOOD.                    135 the little boy, that never wanted to go to school, and said he should be so perfectly happy if he might always play." . "Do tell us, Aunt Mary," said Mattie, leaving her play and coming for the story she had learned to love so much. Sybil's eyes asked too, though she said not a word; so Miss Rogers began, and exerting herself as she saw she was gain- ing the children's attention, she succeeded in keeping it until Jerry knocked at the door ; then, had the satisfaction of having Sybil whisper as she bade her good-bye. "I will ask my grandpapa to let me come often to see you, dear Aunt Mary."  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7088-00000074"/> CHAPTER X. Mn. ATHERTON and Miss Rogers, without any thing more de- finite having passed between them, seemed to consider the matter of governess as quite settled.  Mr. Atherton had been much pleased with the good sense, education, and delicacy evinced by Miss Rogers, and with the keen insight into character for which he had always been remarkable, had been sure that if he had a greater op- portunity for search, he could not have satisfied hinself bet- ter; he therefore made such little domestic alterations as the presence of a new member of his family would render neces- sary, and only waited for some intimation that she was willing to come before he sent for her. In the mean time an event transpired, which convinced him that Sybil must be more carefully looked after than she had been. Old Dinah's pretty cottage had been, through Charles Wallace's visit, a place of common resort for the children. The sound of their voices as they came laughing and chat- ting through the woods, and their little feet as they crum- bled the dry leaves in their path, had become very sweet music to the lonely old woman, and she would watch for it through the day, and lie awake at night, to remember their pretty winning ways. As no harm had ever come to them, and as there was something in the character of Charles, which seemed to pro-   :.1           CCHESTNUT WOOD.         137 mise protection, they had been allowed to go freely wherever they wished. One beautiful afternoon, after having wearied themselves with picking up the bright leaves, and making themn into wreaths for Charlie's cap, and Sybil's curls, a sud- den thought occurred to Charles, which promised them much pleasure; so coming close up to Sybil he said, "Sybil. I read in my fairy book long ago, how there lived in the water some beautiful little beings, called mermaids, and how they sailed about in boats, so small and lovely, that if we could see them they would look like gold, and silver, and diamonds, and every thing else, that is pretty; now, I am sure that not one of all those things is half so beautiful as these splendid leaves, so let us make a little boat, and carry it down to the pond, and push it out upon the water; I am sure if these mermaids see it, one will come up and get in it, and take a ride." "Oh, yes, yes," answered Sybil, ' how pretty it will be. "Make haste, Charlie, and we will sail it right before Old Dinat's window, so that she can see the mermaid too." To work the children went, as busy as bees, and in a few moments they had twined and intertwined the long stems of the maple leaves, until they really made a little boat, in which Queen Miab herself need not have been ashamed to sail. With the greatest care they carried it safely to the pond, but before launching it, Sybil ran to the cottage to move Dinah's chair from its nook by the fireside to the win- dow. This intrusion upon her domestic regularity, the old woman in nowise disliked. As the child flew back to the pond she turned around, and kissed her little hand lovingly to the shining black face at the window, but she could not ;hnr Dinah's "God bless you, my darlingest, beautifullest child,' that came so feelingly from her old heart. Charles stood on the banks of the pond more earnest and interested in his work than many a rich' ship-owner, who  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7088-00000075"/> 138         CHESTNUT WOOD.  launches the craft that is to insure him bothl wealth and dis- tinction. The one was sent to that beautiful children's land, freighted with the rich treasures of hope and faith, in unseen % spiritual existence. The other was to bring back only the glittering perishing material gold, and yet the child must grow to be aman, and must take his chance of losing in the combat of life, even the mnemory of these earlier purer days. The little waves opened around the fairy boat, as it lay upon their glassy surface, then leaped up and down, and touched their cold lips to its bright leaves and welcomed it, as almost as beautiful as themselves, and bore it out, away froii the reach of the small hands that had placed it there. The children's delight was too intense for words. They  i stood with their lips parted, and their' eyes fixed upon its waverinog nmotion, expecting every momlent to see a tiny being  rise from the still waters and seat itself within it; but no, it : only danced on further and yet further, from the flat rock  on which they stood. and a fear that it would go so far away that they could no longer distinctly see it, prompted Sybil to seize a long pole that lay near them and reach out for it. It was a little beyond its length, and the more earnest as she llmet with a difficulty,- Sybil leanedi a little too far for-  ward, and fell into the water. kA scream from both the children followed: it was loud  and lleart-rending, such as is never heard but from lips iln  mortal terror. For an instant Charles hesitated; it was but aln instant, he sprang into the water, and vainly endeavored to roach Sybil, who had already sunk. The water just at this , ' point was very deep, and for that reason had been selected  as the place for the wharf, as the flat stone was called. As  Sybil rose, Charles sank, and. the children would have been! :i lost had not their screams reached the cars of Neptune, who' / had wandered away from them to amuse himself in the woods  J 1  ?"- I   CHESTNUT WOOD.        139 while they played. With a howl and a bound he leaped into the water, caught Sybil by her dress as it-was beginning to disappear again under the water, and brought her to the bankl; then with true Newfoundland instinct dashed back ;  aid bo"e the boy to the same spot, laying them side by side. -  It wts the saddest sight in Old Dinah's life, as having seen first one child and then the other disappear, her heart mis. gave her as to what had happened, and risinog with her tot- tering and uncertain footsteps, she hastened down to the pond. Nep was standing over them with as deep an expres- sion of humnan sympathy depicted on his rough face, as Dinah's wore, but there was none of that utter despair, nor brlolen-heartedness which distorted hers. Both were equally powerless of affording help, both equally conscious of it, and a group for a painter they made, as they clustered there be- side the still pond. "The Lord have mlercy on poor Dinah!" was the first expression that broke from Dinah's lips, and kneeling down hy thlcir side with clasped hands and streaming eyes, Dinah Poured forth a broken but fervent prayer, that we doubt not was heard above, for in a few nlmoments Nep's ears were bent to the ground in an attitude of deep attention; then he uttered a low, sharp bark, then another and another, until suddenly springing up, he dashed off into the woods, keep- irg up a  succession of short sounds, between a bark and a howl-sounds which Old Dinah never forgot, but started o  ften to hear, when the wind groaned mournfully through the old trees around her lonely cottage. She felt, as she Isal Nep disappear, that the'last hope for the children had gone with hin, and coveing  her face with her hands as if s 1e lust shut out theo sight before her, she dropped down on the  ground without making a single effort to restore the children. Excepting the power of prayer she had none left, so sudden and dreadful had the shock been; but it often ,   &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7088-00000076"/> "O        CHESTNUT WOOD. happens that God removes from us in our utmost need, all but the only means which he in his omnisciende knows will avail, but which seems to us in our ignorance worse than use- less. The first thing she remembered, was of hearing Jerry's well-known voice saying, "Whly! Nep, poor fellow! what in natur ails you -there! down sir,--leep still-behave yourself I say." By this time, Jerry had emerged from the wood, the dog leaping with his large paws repeatedly upon him, and in every way testifying his joy at his presence; but as Jerry came within sight of the group upon the bank of the pond, he stopped, then seeming to recognize it as a fiolic in which the children had persuaded even old Dinah to join, he set up a hearty laugh, and called out- "Well done! hurrah there, what you arter?" :No an- swer being returned, nor his presence even recognized, he laughed again louder, but quickened his steps. When suffi- ciently near, -it needed but one glance to tell Jerry the whole story, he only ejaculated, " marcy on me!" and lifting the insensible children, -one in one arm, and one in the other, as if they had been mere dolls, bore them to Dinah's house. The old woman followed, and upon the waves away unheed- ing for the little hands that had fashioned, and the little hearts that had loved it, danced on, the fairy boat, over the still treacherous water. And so live the ever fresh fancies of childhood, undimmed, unharmed, though the cold touch of reality may long since harve effaced them from our minds for ever! The children thad not remained sufficiently long in the water to require any very scientific means for restoration, and as Jerry applied those which the cottage afforded, first to one and then to the other, he had soon the pleasure of    seeing them open their eyes; and the first thing Sybil said as she became able to speak, was- Charlie, say, did the mermaid come?" "The child is crazy," said Jerry turning paler than he had when he first saw her. "Hear her talk!" "Jerry! what is the matter?" asked Sybil, looking at Charles, who lay motionless beside her. '"I don't know, only you have both been drowned, I suppose by the looks. How happened it, Dinah?" Dinah had not yet sufficiently recovered her scattered wits to be able to give any explanation; Jerry could only hear the words "save me, for the deep waters have come over me." "Yes, I know that, Dinah," he said gently, " but how hap- pened it? did the children fall in from the bank, or did they wade in, or what did they do?" "I went after my boat, and fell; but how came Charlie wet and sick?" said Sybil. Charlie smiled, but could not answer; and Jerry, seeing that he was not likely to find out much about the matter, and indeed that it was very little consequence that he should, removed the children's wet clothes, and having made up a large fire in the ample fire-place, heated two home- made blankets, the pride of old Dinah's housekeeping, so hot, that both children quite resented it; and wrapping them up in them, left them; to call Mr. Atherton and a physi- cian, with strict charge to them, and Dinah, that they should not move or talk, but should sleep until his return --a charge which their exhaustion obliged them both to keep, and hardly had Jerry left the house, before Dinah heard the low and measured breathing of childhood's sleep. "God be thanked. Praise the Lord, for Hle is good," she kept saying, in a low voice to herself, but she never re-  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7088-00000077"/> "2         CtIESTNUT WOOD. moved her eyes from  the little sleepers, or stirred, so fearful was she that they might awaken. Ir. Atherton was the first to reach the house. To t ssure himself Sybil had been saved, to see her, to hear her speak, to lnow that she really lived, absorbed every othlcr feeling. He came into the house Awith so much noise that Sybil wakened, and when he bent over her and claspedl her to ]his heart, she, was frightened and be- gan to cry. "' Hush, hush! my darling child," he said, mistaking the cause of her tears, "' I shall not blame you, only tell me how it happened." "I wanted my little boat, and I fell, I believe-I don't know. Did I1 Charlie " Charles had wakened also, and was quite refreshed and like himself. He told the story of the boat and the fall, and his own feeling that he could save Sybil, but how he did not reach her, and only heard dreadful sounds, until he found himself where he then was; but old Dinah, upon whose benumwhed faculties, the quiet sleep of the lchildren lwld had a restorative power, supplied the deficiency in tlhe story, alnd Nep added one more to the long chain of events which bound him so closely to his master. The dog had followed Jerry into the house and had lin down before the fire, drying his. wet hair, and watching tle children with as much solicitude as the most careful nurse. He came now, when Mr. Atherton called llim, and acklnow- ledged his caress with that unassuming gratitude, with which a noble nature receives thauns for favors bestowed, and li seemed perfectly to recognize the valuableness of the gift, when his master promised him a golden collar, with the day of the month and year engraved upon it on which h hlad saved his young mistress's life. '"And for you, my boy," Mr. Atherton said, laying 1lis   CHESTNUT NWOOD.         143 hand upon Charles's head, " you have shown yourself a valiant little fellow, and you and I shall neither of us forget it, when you are a nlan." Charles looked wonderingly in his face. He was not conscious of having done any thing that required praise; he lhad rather expected blame, though for what, he could not definitely determine. He was not perfectly recovered. He had had a double shock, that of seeing Sybil fall, and his own encounter with the water. He could not clearly tell why they had been in the water at all, or why they were where they were now. He wanted to ask many questions, but when he commenced, Mr. Atherton's finger was always laid upon his lip requiring silence. The time seemed long before the arrival of a physician, and when he did come, he was inclined to treat the whole affair-so free from harnm did the childrenappear, as nothing more than a good evening bath, and probably productive-of no more harm. He insisted that dry clothes should be sent for, and the children be permitted to walk home, or roather encouraged to run and play, so that active exercise might remove any chll which should remain in the system. It was almost a miracle to old Dinah, when she saw the two young things, who so short a time ago had lain like dead lilies upon the water's bank, moving about again as full of life and joy as they had beenll when Sybil drew her chair to the window. "Bless the Lord! bless the Lord! ' she constantly ejaculated. Notwithstanding their apparent freedom from injury the children were really much exhausted, and before reaching home, Sybil begged Jerry to take her in his arms, a request hle very willingly complied with, and Charlie lagged so often behind, that Mr. Atherton was obliged almost to drag him lolme. A sound night's rest made Charles perfectly well, but Sybil awakened feverish, and in much pain, and when Mr.  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7088-00000078"/> "4         CHESTNUT WOO), Atherton, who had been often, throuCgh the night, to assure himself that she was sleepingr was called to her, her little pale face, and the bright spots upon her cheek, alarmled him. He sent in haste first for Jerry, then for the physician, then for Miiss Rogers, -and seated himself by the bedside of the child, to soothe her, as best he could, until they should arrive. After her rescue from the water, bhe had felt no inclin.,- tion to recognize in the event the kindness of an Almighty Guardian. His better nature demanded a meed of gratitude, and he had listened to its demand; and quieted the feeling, by the promise of the collar to Nep, and the intention to do much in future life for the boy. HHe saw in it no God, but was pleasedand touched by the fervor with which old Dinah repeated aloud, as the children ran from her cottage. cu Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his benefits. Who reclcdemeth thy life from destruction, iwho crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercy." Indeed he had mused as he walked silently home, upon the comfort which theo old woman seemed to take out of her reli- gion; and while he thought her belief in it was a proof of her ignorance, yet his heart confessed that, while such a ignorance was bliss, it was folly to be wise." It was strange, that while upon every other subject he thought strongly, and to the point, upon this one most im- portant, he allowed his mind to satisfy itself writh vague fallacies, and weak reasonings. And if occasionally an event, like the one just narrated, brought eternity nearer to hil, he turned his eye away from  the light that might have illuminated the gloom, and said to himself, "There then would have been found rest."  As lie sat now listening to the short rapid breathing of his last earthly tie, there would come before him a vision of the quiet graveyard, and a little   t            CrCHESTNUT WOOD . mound rising by the two upon which the grass has grown and withered many times, and he shuddered as, he thought that there-there was the end of so much life, and thought, and feeling, and beauty. Oh! the cold grave is a dismal resting-place for' those iho believe not in the " green pastures, and the still waters " that lie beyond. The punishment for infidelity begins in the pain which the head makes for the heart here. The door of the sick chamber was opened cautiously, and Jerry with his boots off, and his blue yarn stockings answering the place of slippers, entered very softly. He had heard of Sybil's sickness as soon as he had reached the louse, and without waiting to be bidden, had crept up to her room; Mr. Atherton was in no mood to consider it an intrusion, but pointing to the child, said not a word. Jerry took the little hand in his so gently, that it would not have wakened a  restless infant, and putting his large blaclk thumb upon her pulse, endeavored to satisfy himself as to the amount of fever which it indicated. The result seemed unsatisfactory, for he dropped upon his knee, and did not remove his hand, nor his eye from Sybil, until the physician entered.   The opinion  was soon given: The child had a violent fever; but children usually were very sick, when they ailed at all. He could not say certainly, no one could, in the  first stages of a fever; but he saw, now, no particular cause of alarm. How was the  boy?  " No one had remembered Charles, and when they sent for him he was found sitting down on a little footstool he had brought from their play-room close by the door. He was pronounced  well, but sent immediately from  the room and told to stay by'the library fire, but so imploringly did he look up  in Jerry's face, that his kind heart could in no way withstand the  request, and saying,  "I will hold him; &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7088-00000079"/> "6        CHtIESTNUTr rWOO1). let him stay here, while I do. He feels kind of bad, an don't want to be sent away all alone," he took him in hi lap. The color came for a moment in Charles's face; hi thought it not quite manly to be held like a baby, and hl did not wish to stay without permission, so he looked inquir ingly at Mr. Atherton, who granted the request with-  Yes, boy, only keep still."' There is hardly a more helpless sight in the world thia a number of men surrounding a sick bed, it does not matte whether the sufferer be male or female; there seems to b no one to think, no one to act: woman's place,* it be part cularly any where in the world, is emphatically there. S they all felt, as they sat so still in Sybil's chamber; an never was being more cordially welcomed by anxious heart than Aunt Mary, as divested of shawl and hat, and in a uec but every-day dress, as if Chestnut Wood had always bee her home, she came quietly into the room. All rose from their seats, and Sybil, as if by instine wakened; as her eyes fell upon Miss Rogers, she exclaime in a happy voice, "Oh! dear Aunt Mary, how glad I am to see yot Have you come to' stay with me? I am sick. Last igl I dreamed such had dreams, and now I am so hot." "Yes, my darling," said Aunt Mary in so kind and gel tie a tone, that it went to every heart there with a feeling  infinite relief; "I have come to take care of you: and uno here; put your arms around my neck-there, I will make yc a nice cool place, now-gently-yes, that is right. Do( it feel pleasantly?" "Yes, cool and nice; I am thirsty, Aunt Mary.' Jerry went for cold water, and when he returned, i felt more than repaid by the child's sweet- "Thank you, Jerry, it is very, very nice." The prescriptions were given to Miss Rogers, althou   *-,I1: (']I\(IIESTNUJT       WOOD.         147 M Mrs. Giles, who had bustled in and out of the room seve- ral tines since Sybil was awake, stood by, expecting that the medicine would be her part of the care. But no, she was, as she soon found out, entirely superseded, for nursing was one of Miss Rogers's great excellencies, and she never felt inclined to have help when the patient re- quired much care. A composing draft was administered, and were requested to leave the room, not even except. ing the grandfather, and the little asking face of Charles. What a /w life had suddenly opened upon Aunt Mary! Sybil was in lined to talk for the first few minutes, but her medicine soon had its desired effect, and she sank into a quiet sleep ; so liss Rogers sat by her, and watched every breath as it came and went, and felt that her long lonely life was now ended that she had something to love, some- thing to do for, tha would repay her in affection. With th e yearnings of a warm heart, she appropriated that treasure to herself, and with faith and hope, strong but tremulous, she implored the blessing and guidance of Him, who had not forgotten nor forsaken her, when her path in life seemed to lie away from those scenes for which her nature was best iadapted. Specially to His care she commended the life of tihe dear child, a life upon whose slender thread seemed to hIang so many dearest hopes. Day after day passed, and the fever gained rapidly Aunt Mary scarcely left the bedside, for necessary rest, or re- ficeshiment. Mr. Atherton did not remain, though he was a frequilent visitor to the room. Sybil's fever had assumed a a bhraii form, and she was for the nost part either wander- ing or lying in a stupid state. It was no comfort to any one who loved her, to be with her now, though there was something gentle and touching in the visions which visited her bewildered mind. Frequently she would talk of the beautiful beings who were sitting in her little t),:t,. ald  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7088-00000080"/> "8       .   : S!

It had the double advantage of making Mr. Atherton feel still greater confidence in the choice he had made, and Mis Rlogers more free to develope her true nature, which wag her best. ' The prayer of the righteous availeth much, and while every earthly means was tried to save the child there was a silent unseen influence at work, of which Mi Atherton knew nothing, and probably would have thoughl nothing, had he known it. Aunt Mary prayed often, praye fervently, with tears and importunities that would not b refused, and God called back the pale angel, who had ente ed the room and stood waiting beside the bed, and to the litt fluttering heart he gave again the life-blood, and the falte ing pulses he commissioned to renew their task.

Ye after, wheimhe had grown to be a man, he retained a vi   CHESTNUT WOOD.          149 recollection of every thing that was done, and every word that was uttered in that still chamber. The ticking of the large lhall clock, loud and distinct as if it were slowly, but surely, measuring out what remained of the few moments of life, came back to him, when life was earnest and real, and preached to him, in solemn tones, of its briefness, and of that existence beyond the measurement of time. M3r. Atherton sat like a statue by the foot of the bed; he offered no assistance, he only nodded his assent im- patiently when Miss Rogers, as the day dawned, and' the child yet lived, asked that her brother might be sent for, to offer a prayer, if it might be, that she imight yet irecover. She had long wished to make this request, but as there had never dropped from Mr. Atherton even the slightest refer- ence to religious consolation, or hope, she had not dared to propose any thing of the kind before, but now, for the night she had seemed to stand almost within the confines of the spiritual world, and the objects seen removed still further from her all earthly fear. She could not let tlhec child die, and no voice rise audibly to God for the rich boon of her life. She could not have her enter that dark valley and shadow, and no rod and no staff have been asked to guide the little feeble feet through'its gloom. It was a relief to hler, when she obtained even the ungracious consent to send for her brother which the grandfather gave; and well she knew, that he would soon be with them. She heard-so still was all in and around thenm-his step uponll the walk leadii,-: to the house; she heard him noise- lessly open the hall-door, and meeting him, with a woman's ready tact, told him what she wished, and cautioned him not to notice or address Mr. Atherton. llr. Atherton did not look up as he entered the room, nor give any sign of recog- nition as he uttered in a few, brief se:lteneces, an appropriate  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7088-00000081"/> 150         CHESTNUT WOOD. prayer. Yet he heard it all, and the strong man's weal heart longed, as it never had before, for that Chtistian resig- nation which could lean, even in such times as this, upon a Flather's arm. It was a singular coincidence, thlat as the prayer was ended, nature made her first visible cffort at re- suscitation. A gentle perspil'ation broke out upon the little frane-the breathing immediately altelred, and the moanling was hushed in quiet sleep. "God be praised!" said MTiss Rogers, as she n1made her- self fully certain of the change, ("Sybil will live!" "Let us return thanks," said Mr. Rogers, in a tone which carried Mr. Atherton away to tihe scene of the reco- very of the lost child in the morning lighdt, gray and uncer- tain as it was now; and rising, for the first time, he stood with bowed head and folded hands, while the minister, in changed voice and manner, again approached the throne of the Eternal. Charles had crept into the room, and kneeling close by Sybil, with upturned face and wondering eyes, listened to each word of prayer-listened, and never forgot them. The work of 'restoration was slow. Life had so nearly wasted itself, that days and weeks passed and the child was still an invalid, and required careful nursing, patient and gentle nursing, too-and all this Aunt Mary gave her; and her grandfather filled her room with toys and books; and Jerry made little sleds and whistles-cut out grotesqlue- looking animals of wood, which he called horses, or cows, sheep, or dogs, or whatever creature he could fancy they re- seambled,- so Sybil had a menagerie all of her own ; and much joy she took out of it-for Charles, with an imagina- tion which was rather unduly developed for a child of his age, imbued them all with life; the children lived in a little world of their own, as real, and far more pleasing, than that   CHESTNUT WOOD.         151 which the cold winter winds and the snow shut them out fr'om0 enjoyingS, s It was now three nuonths since Charles first came to CIhcestlult Wood, and during that time he had grown much. aund developed more. He had been surrounded by books a:ld objects of whose very existence he had never before Ikown:n and now that lhis parents, his mother particularly, )eccamelc anxious for his return home, he felt, boy as he was, tlat it would be .a step back in life-and though he loved those he had left, yet he shrank from the work on the farm, and the poor teaching of the district school. But Mr. Atherton had no intention that he should re- turn to either. He sent Jerry home with him, and at the same time a1 request that the child might be given to him to educate, promising after all'had been done in the way of preparation that could be, he should himself be allowed to choose whatever business or profession he best liked. Of course the offer was not one to be refused-and be- fore spring came, Charles was placed in one of the best schools that could be found to fit for college. For a time Sybil mnourned sadly the loss of her play- mate-nor was she   easily reconciled, even whein Mattie Rogers was brought from the parsonage to keep her constant comnpany. It required  all the wisdom  and patience that Aunt Mary had   to bear with the whimns and caprices of which Sybil, now more spoiled thlan ever, from the unlimited indulgence which followed her sickness, daily was guilty,- and when it was determined that Mattie should live with them, Miss Rogers made a  regular part of the stipulation, both with Sybil and  her grandfather, that she should share equally with her in every thing. - She did not at all believe in spoiling the temper of one child for the pleasure of another; and if Mattie had been much less dear to  her than she really was, she would have  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7088-00000082"/> 152        CHESTNUT WOOD. made the same requisition.  Therefore, Mattie ccame to Chestnut Wood with rights and privileges equal in every re- spect to those of the young heiress, and Aunt lMary kept an equal watch over both. i   :I       CHAPTER XI. THE moral nature of the two little girls committed to her care became, as might be supposed from Miss Rogers's reli- gious character, an object of paramount interest and impor- tance to her. They were of such different natures, and so differently to be reached-if reached at all-that she was kept constantly on the alert, that an impression given to the one might not prove detrimental to the other. Mattie's religious education, strange to say, had been al- most as much neglected as Sybil's. Perhaps it may in part explain the fact, which there is no denying, that ministers' children are generally less inclined to serious thought and serious life than any others, when it is considered how con- stantly, in one form or another, the Christian course is brought before them. It becomes to them an every-day matter ; the frequent references to it deaden its vitality, and at last it is a mere matter of business-part of their parents' professional life; and comes to be regarded as a physician's child regards a patient-or a lawyer's a client. Mattie had certainly received sufficient verbal instruction, but had never once been made to feel the importance of religion as a rule for conduct. She was familiar with the Bible, and knew many of the more common hymns by heart; but that she could in any way be really accountable for her conduct--  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7088-00000083"/> 154        CHESTNUT WOOD. that she was making for herself an eternity of joy or sorrow, never entered her mind. She was as free from any self-in- posed moral restraint, as the wildest heathen that could be found upon the islands of the Pacific. Sybil, on the contrary, had never been taught her Bible. She had seldom, excepting when with Mrs. Wallace, been taken to church. The whole routine of-a religious educa- tion was as new to her as one would be in classics or mathe- matics. Aunt Mary was not, therefore, long in finding how wholly unoccupied the ground was, and taking advantage of it accordingly. Sybil had much the nobler nature of the two. She de- spised falsehood, selfishness, and meanness of all kind, be- cause they were melan. Mattie avoided them from fear of detection and punishment,-yet Mattie was much the most easily tempted; for her disposition was sweeter, and she would often yield a point when she ought not, for fear she miglt offend or hurt another's feelings. She had much less imperiousness, much less will, than Sybil; and would more easily wind herself around a common heart. Generally, she would become the favorite. But, fortunately for both, the children soon became at- tached to each other, and were really inseparable. Sybil, in their lessons, patiently taught Mattie what she so much more easily and thoroughly acquired-and both were, at the end of six months, making most satisfactory improvement in every respect. Aunt Mary felt rewarded, and more than re. warded. Mr. Atherton was pleased, and busied himself in devising plans which would aid Miss Rogers without at all interfering with her. He left her entirely to herself; nor did he incline, even to himself, to question the propriety of the time which she devoted to religious instruction. Reli- gion, he felt sure, made a beautiful, if not a necessary, trait in female character. There was dependence and gentleness   CHESTNUT WOOD.         155 which it inculcated; and a woman who thought and acted for herself, had never been to him an object of admiration-- hardly of respect. He liked men to be strong and inde- pendent thinkers-able to give a reason for the belief which they held; but he preferred that the gentler sex should walk more "I by faith, than by sight." He had not sought a Christian for his little Sybil's guide; but he was by no means displeased that unobtrusive and sincere piety formed the leading characteristic of Miss Rogers's heart and mind. A life more secluded, and without incident, than that which was now led by the inhabitants of Chestnut Wood, can hardly be imagined. Every thing in and about the house went on with clock-like order and regularity. Spring h ad come, and deepened into summer.  The farm was lworked under Jerry's careful eye. Mrs. Giles superintend- ed, with unerring nicety, all housekeeping matters; even Margy had learned, by dint of much fault-finding on the part of Mrs. Giles, and coaxing and loving from Sybil, to perform her part of the allotted task with neatness and dis- patch. She owed much, also, to words of quiet common- t sense teaching from Miss Rogers-and true to her nature, and her country, she was most grateful for them. Nep divided his time between the school-room and the library, almost seeming to prefer the jocund petting of his young, to the more sober notice of his old, friend. He wore his golden collar, which had been given to him according to promise, and as if that bound him to even more strict fidelity and watchfulness, he never left the side of the children when they were out at play. Jerry said, that if they went to see old Dinah, Nep was sure; no matter where he had been trotting before, to come between them and the water," and so, gradually, the anxiety which at first attended their absence from the house, wore away, and they were al- lowed to do pretty much as they chose in their play hours,  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7088-00000084"/> 156        CHESTNUT WOOD. One afternoon they had gone to visit Mattie's father and mother at the parsonage. Nep had been left at home, much against his own inclination; but little girls, like women, are sometimes subject to whims for which there is no ac. counting, and this the children were much determined upon. They had had a very merry afternoon, and as it was beginning to grow dusk, Mattie was seized with a great desire to re- main at home to tea. Sybil had not obtained any leave to do so, and did not like to stay without permission, so she left Mattie, and started alone for Chestnut Wood. As she shut the gate she could not help wishing Nep was with her, but she was not really timid, so beginning to sing a little song to herself, she walked and ran until she had passed the village, and was on the road which led directly home. Here she thought she heard the sound of coming wheels, and feeling quite sure that it was Jerry re- turning from his work, she seated herself on a stone by the road to wait his coming. The horse came fast, so much faster than Dobbin usually did, that once, but only once, it occurred to her whether she might not be mistaken, a dcl the rider be some one else. She walked a few steps forward, but it was growing darker and she felt more afraid, and more eager to see Jerry, so the wish making the hope stronger, she retraced her steps, and again seated herself. She had but a moment to wait; it was not Jerry but a covered carriage, not in common use in the country, and the horse flew over the road as never farmer urged his working beast in all Hymeswold. There was but one person in the buggy, a young man whom our readers have once before seen. He recognized Sybil, as soon as he came in sight of her, and with a dread- ful oath upon his lips urged forward his horse, as if the matter were one of life or death. Sybil was too much interested in the rapid motion of the   e1I       CCHESTNUT WOOD. -       157 vehicle, to notice any thing else; she sat with her eyes fixed intently upon the reeking, smoking horse, and was more amused by the sudden way in which he was brought to halt before her, than alarmed by the stopping. '"Your name, little girl," said a man leaping from the buggy, is, I believe, Sybil Thornton." "Yes, sir," said Sybil, beginning to tremble. And your grandfather," continued the man, "is old MSr. Atherton, that lives at a place they call Chestnut Wood." "Yes, sir," said Sbil, trembling more violently. "Well, you are th e very child I have come 'way down from New-York to see; now jump in here with me, and I will take you back with me." So saying, he took hold of her hand to lead her. "No, sir, I thank you," said Sybil, beginning to cry, and keeping her seat. "Oh yes," said the man, "I have a great many beauti- ful things to show you; besides, there is some one there, to whom you belong, who says you must come." "But indeed I will not," answered the child; her temper, notwithstanding the circumstances, rising as usual, at the use of the word nmust. "I will not go with you, so you must go away and leave me, for I do not like you at all." "Why, darling!" said the man with a grin which mdde Sybil, child as she was, recoil from him. "There's spunk there,-a bit of the daddy, eh. Well, after all, it's none the worse for it. Come now! you shall have a beautiful ride, and such pretty things, as never child saw before. That's a darling, jump right in, for I am in a hurry;" and so say- ing, he again attempted to lead Sybil towards the carriage. You must not touch me. Let me be," said she angrily, "or I will call Jerry and Nep, and then you will be sorry."  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7088-00000085"/> 158        CHESTNUT WOOD. "Where are they?" asked the man, looking around in a frightened manner. "I will call, and you will soon see," answered Sybil, " if you don't go right away." "Then there is no time to be lost, so here's for it," he said, lifting her in his arms, and notwithstanding her strug- gles to escape, seating her in the carriage; then springing in himself the rattling wheels drowned all the frantic cries for "Jerry and Nep," with which she filled the air. These were of no use; away went the carriage back to the great city from whence it had come, and with it poor little Sybii! Just as the sound of the wheels were dying away in the distance, Jerry with Dobbin and his cart, came lumbering on from an opposite direction. Nep had broken out from the house, and was trotting along quietly by his side. As Jerry heard the ringing noise of the horse's hoofs, as they seemed scarcely to touch the ground, he leaned his head for- ward and listened attentively, then exclaiming--"Don't that critter put into it,-it beats all natur!" he called to Dobbin, as if to inspire him with a little of the same spirit, and even ventured so far as to snap the whip, taking good care however that it should be at a safe distance from his side. When they came to the spot from which Sybil had been kidnapped, Nep stopped suddenly, and be- gan to snuff the air as if there were some mystery there which he could not quite fathom. He ran round and round by the stone upon which Sybil had sat several times, then, out into the middle of the street, giving short barks, his usual way of calling attention to any thing. "What is it, sir?" said Jerry, stopping Dobbin; " what do you smell? a hare, or a rat, or a woodchuck, or a weasel? say, old boy, what have you got hold on now " An angry growl expressed, in a very human way, Nep's dislike to the motives attributed to him.   CHESTNUT WOOD.        159 "Not any one 'un?" said Jerry, quickly understanding him; well; what then? Nep stood still close by the rock, wagging his tail, and looking imploringly in Jerry's face, so Jerry jumped from the wagon, and coming to the spot where Nep was, examined every thing with a great deal of care, but nothing was to be seen; and rather vexed by the delay it had been to him, he took no more notice of Nep's angry demonstration, but jumping into his wagon drove slowly away, leaving, as he said to himself, the dog to catch the thing when he could find it." Yet he could not quite divest himself of the feeling that something was wrong; so he looked back frequently for Nep, and when he found that he did not come, commenced a vigorous whistling for him, which sounded many miles through the still twilight. Sybil thought she heard him, and screamed for joy; but, alas! it I was too far away to be of any use to her. Nep answered it by repeated barks, but at last, finding they were of no avail in calling Jerry back, came slowly and indignantly away, with tail and ears erect, and altogether in such a mood as he was not often found. "Sartain something ails that critter!' said Jerry, as Nep came once more in sight; " he looks mad as a March hare ;how I wish he could speak; he would say more sense than most men, if he could, or I have lost my guess. Nep, poor fellow!" continued he, addressing the dog, "what ails you, eh, boy? A short angry growl was his only answer. "Mad! Well, I am sorry! but I don't see how I can help it. You will feel better, I guess, by and by." An indignant growl again, and Jerry laughed good- naturedly, and without taking any farther notice of the dog, drove towards home. As he was passing the parsonage, Mr. Rogers and Mattie came out, so he stopped to inquire where I  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7088-00000086"/> 160        CHESTNUT WOOD. Sybil was, and was not a little surprised to hear she had dared go home alone, at dusk. She's a timid child, and yet she is as bold as a lion when her spunk is up," he said; "I dare say she got home well enough, but it was a long walk for her, all by herself. I am kind of sorry she didn't wait." When the man who was driving Sybil heard her scream of joy, he turned very pale; he thought she must have seen and recognized some one, so, without daring to look himself, he applied whip and voice to hasten their already venture- some speed. The horse was one of fine mettle-worthy of a far better use; but he was true to his training, and flew away in a man- ner that would have defied Dobbin and Jerry, even had they known whom he was taking from them. So far, since they had started, the man had not addressed one word to Sybil, but as the distance between them and Hymeswold grew greater, he began to lose his fear of being overtaken, and at last, feeling quite safe, he turned to the little pale, frightened child by his side, and said, "Don't be frightened-nothing is going to hurt you; don't you love to ride?" "I wish you would stop, and let me go home."  ' You are going home, to a nice home, too, where you will have plenty of money to spend, and pretty things to play with, and nobody will hurt you, if you are only good and cunning, and do just as you are told." "I want to go back to my grandfather's," repeated Sybil, and began to cry. "Now that ain't sensible--crying won't help you; only. if you are a baby, you will have to be beaten, or shut up in the dark, where the bears will eat you at one great mouth- ful, so you had better stop." Sybil did stop, and not one word or sound escaped her   CHESTNUT WOOD.         161 lips again, through the whole of that fearful drive. It be. gan to grow darker and darker, and the driver reined in the horse, and was more careful. He had from time to time at- tempted to make the child talk, but as he could no longer see her, he concluded she had fallen to sleep, and congratu- lated himself that he had got through the crying so easily ; and taking out a cigar from the crown of his hat, and a match-box from his pocket, he proceeded to light it and smoke. Cigar followed cigar, and Sybil for a while forgot where she was, as she sat watching the fire, as it would gleam forth, and fade away like a fairy thing. Indeed she began to feel quite acquainted with it, and as if it were a friend, that she could talk to, if she were only alone with it. As she felt no inclination to sleep, though it was long past her usual bed-time, she caught the first viewlof the rows of light, that, twinkling away in the distance, gave notice of their approach to some large place. Soon, how- ever, the driver saw it too, and drawing a long breath, as if the prospect was quite a relief to him, he uttered two or three short oaths, applied the whip once more to the jaded horse, and dashed on toward the city. Nearer and nearer came the lights, and soon a sound, like the rumbling of dis- tant thunder; then they began to pass carriages, none of which Sybil could see, but the noise frightened her, and though she was very still, the tears streamed down her checks. Suddenly the carriage in which they were riding came to a stop; then it was violently jerked backwards and forwards, and then followed, from the man who was with her, and  another, who seemed very nrear, a volley of terrible oaths. The next moment Sybil felt herself thrown with violeiue upon the ground, and when she became conscious, she was surrounded by a crowd of men and boys, some with lan-   &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7088-00000087"/> 162        CHESTNUT  70OOD. terns, and all talking loud; and seeming very much ex- cited. A large, rough-looking man, with a lantern in one hand, held her in the other, and, as Sybil looked up in his face, she saw that he wore a band, with large white letters painted upon it, around his hat. He was looking kindly at her, asnd when he saw her open her eyes, he handed his lantern t)o a boy who stood near them, and taking from his pocket a- large yellow silk pocket handkerchief, commenced wiping her face. "Has it hurt her bad? '9 she heard the boy ask. "No, I think not,' answered the man, " but it looks ugly to see a child bleeding so. She must have hit the curb- stone!"' A dozen voices were ready to tell just where and how it happened, but none seemned to know whlat had become of the man with whom the child was riding, or to whom she could belong. Nothing was broken about the carriage, neither was the horse at all injured. It Iad beennimmediately righted after the upset, and the driver lhad gone ff with it, without noticing tho child. ' In that case," said the police-officcer " h /will be back soon, and I will wait here until his return. How the poor child bleeds and trembles. There," said he, in so gentle a voice that those who had only heard it, when engaged in some official duty, scarcely recognized it. " There, don5t be fright- ened, little girl; you are not much hurt, and we will have you safely home to your mother in a trice, after your father comes back for you." "Do not ret him touch me, will you, will you? Where am I?-where is Aunt Mary, and grandpa, and Margy? Oh1, where am I?" almost shrieked Sybil, as she lifted her head and looked at the strange figures and faces around lieF.   p .            CHESTNUT WOOD.         163 "Poor child! she seems scared," said the officer e Now don't worry, dear; you are safe-nobody shall touch you- nobody shall hurt you, and by and by Aunt Mary will "No she will not' nsid Sybil, recovering from her calm. "She is at Chestnut Wood, a great way off, and the wicked man has stolen me away frolm there. Take me home; oh, please, sir, take me home." 'Yes, you shall go home," said the man, soothingly; only wait a little, and don't be frightened."  A few words from him dispersed the crowd, and, much to Sybil's delight, she was left alone with him and the little boy, who held the lantern. Before they had waited long, a woman was seen hurrying through the street towards them. She stopped when she came where thley were, and looked carefully at them, without speaking; but at last, seeming assured that all was right, she asked in a pleasant voice, "if the child's name was not Sybil Thoraton? 'T "Yes," said Sybil. "Well,- I have come to take you homc," said the woman i; kindly. "Are you much hurt?" "Who sent you?" asked Sybil, giving her hand without the slightest hesitation. "Did grandpapa, or Aunt Mary, and where is Jerry? Why didn't he come?" "Oh, you will hear all about that when you get home; now, take right hold of my  hand, and walk as fast as you can, without talking; lfhat's a good girl." Sybil did as she was told, and the contented way in which she left  him would have satisfied the policeman that all was right, even if his suspicions had. been aroused; but they had not, and bitterly did he regret it afterwards. Sybil hurried on with her guide through streets which now began to be dimly lighted, but the lamps only served to bring to view the many dark holes and lurking corners,  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7088-00000088"/> 1'64        CHESTNUT WOOD1. without at all revealing what they might perhaps conceal. Sybil thought she felt less afraid where it was perfectly dark. There was something very fearful in the figures that were so constantly gliding by them; and in the roll and roar of carriages, near and distant. When .they crossed the street, she instinctively clung with both -hands to her com- panion, and so wljvry and faint and frighlltened was she that several times a slight impediment in her way nearly threw her down. Once and once only her companion spoke, then in a quick, angry voice, she asked, 'i Can't you keep on your feet, you awkward thing?" at the same time twitching vio- lently the little trembling hand she held. At length they came to a street which looked better and more habitable than any they had yet been in. - Before entering it, the woiman looked carefully about her, hesitated, retraced her steps, passed a man once, and then again, spoke in a low voice to him, and at last, seeming satisfied by his remark, went boldly on, up the nice looking street. After going half its length, sle lmade a sudden pause, looked steadily in at the open window of the house on the opposite side of the street, then crossed directly over, and -without any farther delay, entered. Sybil was now so nearly ex- hausted that she had taken no more notice of the -wollan's last movements than she would have had she gone directly into a, house. She was neither surprised nor frightened any longer by vrllat she saw and heard. She hardly was con- scious that the man who had stolen her from Chestnut Wood and another older had colme into the room to which the woman had taken her, and as they did not address them- selves directly to her, she soon fell asleep in her chair; nor would she probably have walkened again formany hours, lhad she not been roughly shaken and told to " wake up, and eat her supper, tnd then go to bed ; that was the place to sleep, not in a chair."   CAIESTNUT WOOD.        t65 When. Sybil opened her eyes, she was alone with the woman, and was too fatigued to notice any thing. or make a single inquiry; so she tried to swallow a few mouthfuls of the bread and butter which were put before her, but fell asleep afain befores she had finished them. She knew no- thing. more -until morning; then she was wakened, and by so strange a face and figure that she at first thought she must be still dreaming, and rubbed her eyes to force herself to see plainly. The figure was that of an old woman, so short and deformed that she certainly seemed more like the phantom of a troubled sleep than like a human creature. She was dressed in a dark, coarse, woollen dress, covered with patches of every shade and variety, from a light faded calico to black broadcloth. One   arm  was of the usual length, but the other was only as long as the upper joint of that one, and yet, at what should have been the elbow, there was a hand, slmall and rather shrivelled, but still perfect in its members. The shoulder to this arm was raised some inches above the other, acl, a large bunch grew out just behind it, upon her back. She had a  short neck, thick and firmly set, only it was as high above the raised shoulder as above the other tl erefore her head had a one-sided appearance, which made it look constantly as if it were going to drop off, or rather would, if it were not held on by so stout a neck. Her face was longo and very thin; a  wide, toothless mouth, seemed to stretch across it, from ear to ear; then her nose was large and crooked, like an eagle's beak ; her eyes small, gray, and' dored peculiarly ugly by a constant habit of winking, and hl0ole tout ensemble was surmounted by short hair, of a color, between black and gray, which'stood up literally on end, like porcupine's quills. When she saw Sybil was really awake, she said, in a whining, coaxing tone, which she had been for years accustomed to employ in her street. begging.  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7088-00000089"/> 166        CIIESTNUT'r wnOOD. ," Och darlint! and it's for waking up you are now, is it? Well, and a precious good morning it is to you, for a sweet child that you are--ou are." Sybil looked at her ill silenm t wlonder, but as the old wolllat put out her deformed arm to caress her, she screil- Cd, and covered her face with the bed-clothes. "Och darlint," said the creature, in the salle tone in which dle ad spoken before. "It is not afeard of old Mioll you ae, is it now; say is it?,' and Sybil felt her pulling the covering fronm off her face.

"What great fire?" said Sybil stopping; and looking at her. "Why, the fire that burned up your house where you used to live, and all your folks, and would have burnt you too, but I ran and caught you out, and saved you for mar- cy's sake." Sybil looked bewildered; she thought it lmust be so; she could account in no other way for the sudden changes which - had come upon her, so she desisted from undressing herself, and stood looking fron her clothes to the old woman, in a state of most pitiable confusion. The woman saw it, and following up her advantage, said in a wheedling tone: "Ah! and it's a good child I knew you would be, for a beauty you are, and you and old Moll will be the truest of friends, indeed and .indeed we will. You shall go out with 1me, and mlany a grand sight you shall see, only be a good child, and don't get mad at old loll; that's a darlint-a perfect jewel-a honey of a child. Come now, go to the parlor and I will give you your breakfast. Take hold of lmy and,"-and she extended her short arm, and leaned down to reach the child. Sybil shrank from her, which the old woman seeing only laughed, and catching hold of her long curls said, with a pall, ' Well, darlint, I ain't tickelar, this will do just as well, it's a handleony how; and that is all I want." Sybil's temper again flashed in her face, and she stood still, determined not to go, but some hard twitches quite   &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7088-00000090"/> 1i 08       rCnLESTNUT WOOD subdued her, and she followed the woman down stairs, on two, three pairs, she hardly knew how many,-for if she lat ged at all, her pace was quickened by harder and harder pull When she reached the room which the old woman had calle the parlor, she found herself in a low dark cellar, or rathl cellar kitchen. The walls had once been plastered, an even whitewashed, but now, the plastering was broken off i many places, and bits of the mortar hanging down with het and there a loose lathing, told tales of hard usage. Thea were three or four old chairs, and one pine table, but ever thing was so filthy, that it was difficult telling what the had originally been. "There!" said the old woman dropping Sybil's hai and pushing a chair towards her," sit down, darlint, and breakfast fit for a queen you shall be for having; only se there! and there! and there!" so saying, she opened tl door of a dark closet, and put upon the table first a plate o bread, on whose side Sybil saw thick white mould; then bit of broken potter's ware, containing a little gray mixtur. probably once salt, and lastly a few pieces of cold potato evidently picked out fronrt among many other substance Sybil turned away with ill-concealed disgust.

"Not so," said the man, shading his eyes with his hands. Oh, not so; that is so very, very like her." "Like who, sir?" asked Sybil. "No matter-go, child!" he said, with an altered voice and manner; " upon the third and fourth generation, it is - written, and the curse mnust come.

"It's a, dog, then, I am called for my pains, is it?" growled Moll, in tones not very unlike those of the animal  to which she had been compared. "Well, we will see.

Seeing that  ie received no answer, hle seated himself on a corner of the table by Twhich Sybil was sitting, and commenced druminmg a series of tunes upon it which perhaps were lusical to his car,-they certainly were not to any one's else. In this hle persevered inost indefatigably, fixing, at the sa-me tine, a very free gaze upon Sybil, until Brown, wlo soon began to exliibit malrks of annoyance, said,  And your business tlhis morning is making holes througl that table, or staring the child out of countenance, I suD- pose." "rWell, I don't know," said Billings, stopping suddenly;  the first thing is to exchancge these clothes-for a fuss  and a half there will be down there when they miss the child.

Sybil raised her head for a moment, when she lceard lier grandfather's name. and a, ray of joy passed ecfr her pale face-but it was gone in an instant as her eye fell uponl tle dark countenances of the two men. "I will go," saicd Billintgs, getting off from the table and moving toward the door, "and see what I can hunt u1 ip the way of girl's clothles-it is rather new business for me, but I tlhink I shall succeed.' "Let them be new and clean,'" surlily demanded Brown, as the other went out.   CHESTNUT WOO)D.  u' Perhaps you will suit yourself better," said Billings, putting his head back; " I am sure I have no objection to your trying." Brown answered only by a look, but it: was sufficient,. The door hastily closed, and Sybil heard with joy the man's footsteps die away upon the walk; then she-folded her hands and laid them upon the table, and soon finding she was un- molested, she laid her head down and fell asleep. The first thing of which she was conscious was hearing a woman's voice saying, "She is as stupid as a block; you may as well send her back, for you never will make any thing of her. She does nothing but sleep, as if she was a fool. Here, wake up, if there is any wake to you," and Sybil found herself shaken in no very gentle manner.  She found herself upon the table, with a roll of clothes for a pillow, and an old, but warin cloak thrown over her. The wild frightened  look lwhich she cast about her would have softened aly but hearts of stone, but she heard only a coarse laugh, and a rough hand pulled her on to the floor. This time she neither cried nor trembled, but drawing up her little figure to its full height, with a flashing eye she turned and confronted the girl who had thus unceremonli- ously interrupted her sleep ' "Who are you," she said, " and why am I here?" "La! Miss," said the girl, dropping a courtesy, and pre- tcending to be very much frightened, ' I declare this is as good as a play. Pray don't beat me!" "Answer me, then," said Sybil, turning pale, but ex- hiblting no sign of fear; ' who. are you, and where is my grandfather, and Jerry, and Aunt Mary?" "Oh, as for that, Miss," said the girl, again courtesying, "my name, is Nancy Lefavour, at your service, and as you have seen those folks you were speaking of since I have, you  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7088-00000094"/> 176         CHESTNUT WOOD. should know best where they are, and how they do, too, I suppose. Now, if it please your ladyship," dropping another courtesy, 'we will have no more of those airs; but those clothes you have on, and the sooner the better, as you are to take a walk with me, and see the beauties of the city." Sybil offered no resistance ; there was somethlg in tiie mlock humiliation of the girl which disarmed her more tlhan l blows would have done, and so she stood quite still, whle her own clothes were once more removed; but those which were put upon her now were whole and clean, though very  coarse and common; still she felt no repugnance to tlhem;  she only wondered whether she could be the same little girl  that was once so happy at Chestnut Wood.  A large bon- net, made of sti-'f pasteboard, covered over with dark calico, and a long full cape, gathered around the neck, was the    f covering she seemed to require for the street, and being soon made ready, Nancy took hold of her hand with a grasp which at once made Sybil recognize her as her companion of the night before, and the two left the house together.   CHAPTER XII, SOON after Sybil had left Mr. Rogers's house, on the evening when she was kidnapped from Hymneswold, Mrs. Rogers be- gan to bustle about and get tea. It seemed very pleasant to her to have lMattie at lhome again. Her mother's heart had yearned often after this only child, and many and many a lonely hour had come which neither "husband nor the. parish" could occupy; but she was too worldly-wise-too fond of looking forward, and acting with reference to that futu e day when the small stipend, misealled a salary, should ceasc and Mr. Rogers, with the chill of age fast benumbing what yet remained of vitality in his professional labor, should find himself superseded by a younger and more popular man. Mrs. Rogers, much more than the worthy minister himself, regarded this period of their lives with a dread similar to that with which many look forward to parting with dear invalid friends, rendered still dearer by the continual care and anxiety which every day of their lives brings with it, or to the final separation of themselves from every earthly interest or affection. If Mrs. Rogers had been asked sud- denly, "Which do you dread most--the day of your death, or the day of your ceasing to be the wife of the pastor of Hymeswold?" there is no doubt, if she had answered truly, which she would have said. VOL. I.-8-  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7088-00000095"/> 178         CHESTNUT WOOD.              It was this dreadful day that was to come that had re.  conciled her, more than any thing else, to the parting with  Mattie, and those little visits, when she could see the child,  and yet not interfere with her prospects, were gala days in-  deed to good Mrs. Rogers. A few years ago, Mattie would  -! have thought the table, spread purposely in compliment   ^ to her own little self, sufficiently elegant for any queen,;  but now she had become so accustomed to the luxury and refiement of the table at Chestnut Wood, that even this  ? prodigality on her mother's part seemed rather inferior to  W her, and she was tempted to expatiate on the vulgarity of  } eating with a two-pronged steel fork, when, seeing her father put nearly half of his tea knife into his mouth, in order to convey a bit of cream toast thither, her fastidious spirit was checked and she was forcibly reminded who and what she was. After tea was over, -she was disinclined to assist her mother in washing up the dishes, but her parents wisely uttered not one word of reproof; perhaps it was pleasing to the pride of her mother-it rather conveyed to her the promise of the future lady; and wlhat parents yet ever lived who did not wish to see their' children better off-higher up the ladder of life-than they had been themselves? M  lattie talked very fast she had much to tell her parents, and they many questions to ask, perhaps not always within the bounds of the strictest propriety, but then they were all one family, and what did it really mnatter?-so at least they reasoned. Time passed so quickly and so agreeably that the clock struck eight long before they expected it, and a very unwil- ling little party were they, when the last stroke warned them that Aunt 3lary would be expecting Mattie back, and per- haps feel anxious about her, if she was detained beyond t11e usual timee; so Mr. Rogers prepared to accompany her, and Mrs. togers rolled up a little napkin full of her really nice   CHESTNUT WOOD.          179 tea cakes for Aunt Mary and Sybil, then, with many kisses and farewells on both sides, Mattie once more left the pater- nal roof. The same sky was over her head-the same still patient stars were looking down upon her-as, clasping her father's hand, she walked safely and happily on--as were also watching poor little Sybil, when, trembling and afraid, the wild horse and his reckless driver were bearing her away farther and still farther from all she loved. It was not yet nine when they reached MrI. Atherton's house,- and as Mr. Rogers had been of late quite a frequent visitor to his sister, and sometimes also to Mr. Atherton, he ventured to go in and knock at the library door. Hf had been disappointed in seeing Mr. Atherton in pew No. 3, but not in finding the slip rented by him, and his name upon the list of those who paid small taxes for the " support of the gospel;" but though Aunt Mary and Sybil were always punctual in their attendance upon church, never once had thlle great man's" foot crossed the threshold of the sanctu- ary. He had hired the seat Miss Rogers had wished-had willingly given his consent to Sybil's attending with her- Iut generally spent the day himself shut up in his library, and SIiss Rogers took care that Sybil should not be a fre- quent visitor there. Mattie was always allowed to remain at the parsonage from Saturday night until Monday morning. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rogers had'for a time been very sore upon the subject of Mr. A therton's non-appearance. They considered it as an open disrespect, which might in the end injure their influence among their people; but there was no help for it, and they submitted with the best grace they could. In his intercourse with Mr. Atherton, Mr. Rogers never dared to hint at the subject, but twice ventured so far as to indulge in a little peroration on the " utility and beauty of the holy institution of the Sabbath." He always found Mr. Atherton gentlemanly, generally agreeable, and had suf-  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7088-00000096"/> O       .

To-night, Mr. Rogers found him sitting as usual by the ble, with his book in his hland, but he met him with an Un-  nmuon cordiality, his first salutation being-  cI Mr. Rogers!

"Sir, I beg your pardon, I don t know as I understood you. Sybil. not home--a Ialf h our ago-wlhy, she left the parsonage before darl." "Alone?" asled it.

It was not dark, and she could not be prevailed upon to stay without leave. She felt no fear-neither did we ; not so much as a dog was ever harmed by the good people of Hymeswold.  I think the child must have come home, and perhaps gone quietly to bed." "Not without Miss Rogers' knowledge," answered Mr. Atherton; "but we will soon know." John, who had im- mediately answered the bell, was dispatched to make inqui- ries-and in the mean time Mr. Atherton began to walk with very quick steps up and down the room, and Mr. Rogers to fidget most unceremoniously in his chair. John met Miss Rogers and Mattie upon the stairs. Miss Rogers had immediately taken the alarm on Mattie's entering her room without Sybil, and had only waited to draw from the frightened child the facts relating to Sybil's departure from the parsonage-therefore, when she reached the library, she looked at Mr. Atherton, and Mr. Atherton at her, with very little expression but that of blank aston- ishmlent.  "Whact can 'it mean?" at last asked Mr. Atherton, sharply. "What can it mzean?" answered Aunt Mary, without being conscious that she was only repeating his words. "What has become of Sybil, Mary?" asked Mr. Rogers, rising and coming close up to his sister. "Did not she come home an hour-no, 'most three hours ago?" "I have not seen her since she left at two, to go to the parsonage," answered Aunt Mary, slowly and much more calmly than she had spoken before. : I can think of nothing that could have kept her but perhaps going to Miss Palmy Fitch's, and spending the evening with Jerry." "In which case, she will soon be home," said Mr. Ather- ton, looking again at his watch. Now, it was as if time had suddenly become gifted with   &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7088-00000097"/> CHESTNUT W ouuu life, and each moment as it passed struck a heavy blow upon the heart, so sensibly did its passing make itself felt to the anxious ones who   were listening for the child. It was not, to be borne long' and before the hand of the watch pointed to half-past nine, the house was in commotion-all, even to little Mattie, prepa ring to go out in quest of Sybil. Mr. Atherton's and Mr. Rogers's thoughts went naturally back to ( the first time she was lost--but tht was under very different circumstances from those present now. Then she was but little child, and the country all around Chestnut Wood perfectly unknown to her. Now, not a rabbit or a squirel knew the  haunts better; ealch large old tree-each high rock-each spot of bright green turf, was as familiar for within miles around as the very environs of Chestnut Wood; they would as soon have espe cd old Nep to miss his way, as the little nature-loving Sybil. There was no hope that she was simply lost-,no fall--the sudden spraining of her anklec-or, they could not tell what; but certain it as, the child was gone! and so now they all stood in the library, with hats and bonnets, ready to go--ut where? r. Rogers felt an inclination to invite all to prayer--bt he had so certain a feeling that the child must be there, and Mr. Atherton continued to walk the room with such unequal and hurried steps, that it forced itself upon the good man's mind, in spite of his piety, that Lis was ai exception to the Bible commtand, ccPray without ceasing, and so he wisely restrained the language, which was so natural an out let to his own emotion, and stood, hat in hand, waiting once more to bear his part in the recovery of the lost one. "I do not see, Miss Rogers," said Mrt. Atherton, in an- swer to her earnest look for direction, '" any use in your, or ally of the women' of the house, going out at all; the child certainly is not lost any where around the house. I am afraid something more serious has happened to her, though  CHESTNUT WOOD.         183 of what nature I am entirely at a loss to divine.

"' And may I trouble you," said Ir. Rogers, in a voice which carried its apology for the request with it, " to call at the parsonage, and just say to Mrs. Rogers what has de- tained me. She is apt to feel a little troubled when I am out without her being aware of my whereabouts.'" '{ She shall be informed," answered Mr. Atherton, ab- ruptly-and without one other word the party broke up. Jerry was in bed, and had been for some time sound asleep, when M3r. Atherton's hand dropped the bright knock- er on Palmy Fitch's door. It started him upon his feet in an instant, and lifting his window-for he knew Palmy had been herself some time shut up in the bedroom below-he asked in as broad awake a tone as if he had been waiting for the slHmmons, " What is5t, Mr. Atherton? Nothing wrong at home, I hope?" "Sybil has gone," answered Mr, Atherton, " and we do not know where. Have you seen her?" ' You don't say so!" said Jerry, with a start, which Mr. Atherton heard, though he could not very distinctly see him. "Wa'al now, that beats all natur'!-what has got into that child? 9 She comes and goes like a witch-or-a," and Jerry forgot to finish his sentence in his haste to put on his clothes.

He scratched his head;  knocked his hat first on one side and then on another; uttered every ejac- lation his very copious vocabulary could supply; but all of no use He was completely at his wit's end. "You might put her blindfold any where within five miles of Chestnut Wood" he said, " and she would find her way back as true as a cat.

Sot if she ain't here, and she a in't there nary, why the question, Mr. Atherton, is--" said Jerry, stopping sud- denly and  looking him full il the face, "where in nature is she? More easily asked than answered, Jerry," answered Mr Atherton. "What can have become   of her?

"I say for't,1 said Jerry, taking off his hat and givig it a swing over his lead, " that's 'umn--that dumb crittu knows more tlhan any on us, and I eeny jest have a, mind to believe he has got a soul. How he took on, it was like mad; and yet-' Jerry stopped abruptly, "Ididn't find nothing there-and ten to one I shan't now;but that ther   o use telling-so come on, Mr. Atherton.

"About Nep, to be sure; and how he barked and growled, and smelt all around that big rock on the road. I thought he m ust smell a rat or a rabbit, or some such wer- min-but not a crittur could I see. Still there was a some- thing, that's sartain; and if he Qould speak, how convenient it would be just now." As they walked to the spot in the road from which Sybil had been taken, Jerry, whose mind: once put upoll  the alert, had becom e very active, was full of all manner of conjec- tures as to what could have become of the child, but we need not say all flr firom the truth of what had actually hap- It was too dark, even with the help of lanterns, to dis- tinguish more than a few feet from them; but Jerry, with- out difficulty, recognized the place upon which he had been stopped by Nep's importunities, and  again commenced a careful scrutiny of its surroundings. Not a tree, nor a shrub --hardly a tuft of long grass, that he did not turn over with his great hands to make sure that it contained no news of Sybil; but he forgot what to a less keen observer would have been the first object of examination,-the road, and the tracls which were very visibly marked upon it. Mr. Ather- ton noticed them, and called Jerry's attention' to them. As the lantern was swayed backwards and forwards, they could distinctly see the deeply indented hoofs of a horse's feet and the wheels of a carriage also; after tracing them on a few rods, the place where the carriage was turned, and the many prints mnade by the restless animal as his route was changed. Very few words were spoken as they made themselves aware of these facts; but when the question of the coming and going back of a vehicle was settled in both of their minds, Jerry put down the .lantern, and throwing himself flat upon the  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7088-00000099"/> 186         CHESTNUT WOOD. ground applied his ear to it, and continued for some time in. tensely listening. But in vain-the carriage which bore Sybil away was, by this time, fast nearing the great metrop- olis, and keen indeed must have been the sense whichh could discern its roll. After continuing in this posture for some time, Jerry raised himself with a shake like a giant's, and said, "There ain't no wheels within five miles now. I shouldn't be afraid to bet a five dollar bill, but I heard it-I know I did. The horse tore like lightning, and the wheels rattled like thunder. I wondered what had broke loose-'cause I knew there was no horse in Hymeswold that would go that rate, any how." ' When was it, Jerry?" asked Mr. Atherton.  "Why then, just afore Nep told me-as well as he could -poor crittur, that something had happened. I see it all now. She was a walking on home here,.and somebody over. took her, and she was so handsome like that they have run off with her. Poor child! poor child!" For a moment a visible tremor passed over Mr. Atlher- ton's firame, but it was only for a moment; for in the next, he  asked, in a low husky voice; "What could their object have been in taking so young a child?" "( To sarve their master, the old lion who goes about roar-  ing, I suppose," answered Jerry. "And one day he'll pay them up their wages, full, plump, with interest too, I hope." So firmly did the idea of Sybil's having been stolen take possession of their minds, that without making any further attempt to search for her, thley turned their steps, maste  and man together, for sorrow soon levels all distinction, to- wards Chestnut Wood. Again they walked on in silence-each was busy drawing his own inference,-each trying to form his plan for the fu- ture. Jerry's mind was one wild chaos of fears and per-   E             CHESTNUT WOOD.8 187 plexities. He knew very little of the great world, and no possible situation or wish could suggest to him an induce- ment to carry off so dear a child, not even the one, of her beauty, which- he Iad so promptly suggested to Ir. ther- ton, was of any account to *is soberer thouglt. His head must have been made of tough material, or it would certain- ly have been the worse for the rubs and knocks which he gave it while attempting to clear his ideas. Not so with Mr. Atherton. ThIis, unlike the other events whiceh had threatened to deprive him of Sybil, had roused within his breast everybad passion of his nature.  He felt as if an invisible power-that fate, under whose iron control, in spite of all his endeavors to resist, hie had ever been, wa pressing heavily upon him. Wounding him where he was most susceptible, divining the secret and most cherished portions of his heart, and rending them with a rude and unrelenting grasp. Therefore he roused himself  in his inight, and bra. e, again lst it, withstood the shock after the first assault like a statue carved out of solid rock.

The night passed quickly away. Not one, not even Mr. Rogers, after having nlade himlself sule that Mrs. Rogers knew where he was, seemed to feel any inclination to go to bed, and the pale gray light of the morninog, as it stole cheller- lessly in'upon- thenm, dawned -uLpon but one sleeper, and that was Mattie, who had laid her head in Aunt Marly's lap, and almost unnoticed, fallen soundly asleep. If they had been asked, not one could have told wlhy they had thus watched through the night, but there the day found theml ;- and even then they seemed reluctant to sepa- ratp, the only conclusion to which they had come, being to have handbills with a description of Sybil posted up in the different villages around, and Jerry sent out to inquire if any one had seen the carriage-the remembrance of the sound and the nmarks of which had so closely associated themselves with Sybil's disappearance. Jerry first went to see Dilnah. He knew the old woman had been alarmel by Mr. Rogers's visit and inquiries the night previous, and le thought it would be a comfort to the lonely soul to hear what had been done, or rather what hlad not,-so without caring for the extra length of the walk, his own personal trouble seldom coming between him and thle dictates of his kind heart, he went around by the pond, home to Miss Palmy Fitch's, to inform her more particularly of what had happened, and provide himself with his own trusty Dobbin. Both of these tlings were performed in half tlhe tilme it would have taken any other man, ancd Jerry founrd himself jolting away in the identical old wagon, that had be- come almost as'necessary a part of his excursions as Dobbin  himself. He went to the spot where the carriage had turned, wheeled Dobbin around just there, and after a few minutes observation learned to distinguish the broader track of the   IF            CHESTNUT WOOD.          89 wheels of the city vehicle fronm the narrower and deeper ones of the conutry made carts and wagons. Sometilmes a harder bit of ground would retain them so slightly that it was only by dismounting and loolin e oe  to the ground that Jerry could distinguish them at all; but (as it was still very early in the morning, and for the first part of the road very few, if any carriages had passed, he had no difficulty in driving straight on, as he felt sure, after Sybil. So. intent was he upon this, he neglected to inquire at the farm houses by which he passed, and it was not until he found that he was losing the decided nature of his guide, in others of nearly the same stamp, that he remembered the in- junctions Mr. Atherton had given him. At first he felt much chagrined, for Mr. Atherton had early taught him to obey orders strictly, but a little reflec- tion as to the necessity of taking advantage of a thing so soon obliterated as a track in the sand, made him come to the conclusion that he had done precisely what he ought, and what Mr. Atherton would have directed if he had known the circumstances. Very frequently now he was obliged to stop Dobbin, and get out to examine the road. He knew the exact width of the wheel and the size of the horse's feet as Kell as he knew his own, and perhaps better, thoughe had shod Dobbin and replaced the tire upon the wheel of hIis wagon many times since he had owned them. After going about fifteen miles from Hymeswold he was obliged to acknowledge to himself that he could no longer trust the guide he had so far followed, for track lay upon track, crossing and reecrossing' and hoof after hoof had beateen down each other's marks almost as soon as made. Very reluctantly he confessed the fact, and still more re- luctantly he turned his horse's head to retrace his steps, and make those, inquiries, which he now fervently wished he had not neglected. To  go on he knew was foolish, unless he  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7088-00000101"/> 190        CmHESTNUT WOOD. could be assured that Sybil had actually passed over the same road. 1 e didl not, however, drive far on his way back y without stopping at a house.      t It was a largo old Dutch-farml house, standing so inalmc- c  diately upon the road that he felt assured " no team could  make the noise that 'ere, one did, without folks hearing on't, if they were deaf as adders, and blind as bats" ,--lat con- neetion the eyes could have with the ears in this ase, Jerry not stopping very clearly to determine. An old woman *answered his hasty summons upon the door; she aus "deaf as an adder," and so Jerry found, after many ineffeptul at- tempts to mnake her hear and understand. H e pee ped over her shoulder into the large clean kitchen, but no one appear- ing there, he made his awkward bow, and drove on. Dii- culties, instead of discouraging hd lwys ha because et of inciting Jerry to redouble his exertions, andb eause h had failed at the first louse at which he had stopped, had made him resolve not to pass even brn without mfaking inquiries, if he could find a living being of whom to "ake them.

"Don't know nothing what you are a talking," ' answered the man, with a more unmusical voice than his grindstone, and about as hard a heart. "Well, now, that's amusing," ' persisted Jerry. ; That's hard'work you're about; if I could stop, I would give you a lift; I am used to the business, but I am a hunting up a little gal that's lost; perhaps you ain't a father your- self? :' "Should think not-only ten of them-eight girls and two boys,"' answered the man, a little more genially. "Oh, now!-no, you don't say so; well, I dare say you wouldn't take it terribly to heart if one of these days you should lose one of them gals; should you, though?" and Jerry gave a very knowing wink, that for the first time at- tracted the attention of the farmer. Stopping his work, he leaned upon the stone, and stared straight into Jerry's face. "You don't want a wife, do you?" he asked hesi- tatingly. "Why, yes, if I can find a smart likely gal that will have me, I mean to hitch on some day. I dare say, now, some of them eight are very likely, ain't they though?" "Shouldn't wonder," said the man, walking leisurely up to the wagon; "  who may you be, if I may be so bold?" Sartain, my name is Jerry Goldsmith, and my charac- ter you can find upon applying to Mr. Atherton, of Chest- nut Wood," said Jerry, a little less boldly, for never before in- his life had he come so near that terrible phantom of mnatrimony.  Eight girls actually in that very house, by his side; he took up the reins, but as he was about to start, he thought he would make one more effort to gain some intel- ligence of Sybil, so he said--  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7088-00000102"/> 192        CHESTNUT ttVOOD. "Mr. Atherton lost his granddaughter last night, and I am out looking after her; you said you hadn't seen nothing of her, I believe? ' The man now civilly inquired the particulars, and Jerry, who began to feel quite acquainted, related them in full. 'While they were talking, a boy of twelve years had conme out from the barn and joined them. When he heard the mention of " lost child," he seated himself upon one of the shafts, leaned himself familiarly against old Dobbin's back, and was soon all attention. Jerry had not noticed his approach, and was not a little surprised when he heard him cry out- "A little girl with a blue dress and white apron, and long yellow curls, and a big bonnet, like a boy's hat, on her head?" "Yes,- have you seen her?" demanded Jerry, springing firom his wagon, without being conscious what he was doing, and confronting the boy; ".say,.-ave you seen her?" "I saw,) said the boy, speaking slowly, and seeming to endeavor to recall every little particular, " just after dark when I was comling home from swimming, a horse and chaise come driving down the street like fury, and I stopped to see who could be kicking up such a dust. Well, I did not wait long, I tell you, for it came a tearing along, and when it was right opposite me, I looked in, and there was a man and a little girl, and the girl was crying, and seemed to feel bad, and so I tried to run along by them, to see if I could find out what the matter was, and I did keep up long enough to see just how she was dressed, so I should know her again any where." ('; Here's a quarter for you, boy,)' said Jerry, putting his hand quickly into his vest pocket and extracting it, " and thank you, too; which way were they going?"

Mr. Rogers had been into nearly every house in his parish making in- quiries. Aunt 3Iary had taken Mattie by the hand and carefully explored every nook and corner between Chestnut Wood and the parsonage, and the servants, each in their own way, had done their best. Margy was very, very sure tlhat Sybil had been taken away ,as the saints were, and would never again be found, out of heaven; so she, for thle most part, folded her hands, or threw herself upon her knees, and prayed fast, if not fervently ; and Mrs. Giles, the minu- time of whose housekeeping was sadly disturbed by these events, tried her best, for she had become as much attached to the child as there was power of loving in her withered heart, to be good-natured anrd. quiet, and nmuh her partial success added to the comfort of those around her.

Occasionally, during their consultations, le looked up in Jerry's face, with an dxpression which seemed to say, "You see, I knew best, you should have attended to me in time; " but it was all the reproof he allowed himself to utter, and, for the most part, he lay upon the library floor, near the door, with head erect, ears in the position of listening, and paws preparedfor a spring any moment he might, be wanted. When Jerry opened the door, he sprang upon him, as if more impatient than any of the others to hear whatever news he might have brought.  Whether he understood it, when he did hear iti, may be somewhat of a question, but lie lay down again, when it was finished, in the same attitude of waiting.

"Yes, sir, sartain," answered Jerry, but in an injured tone, which pierced through the rock, part way to Mr. Ath- crton's heart; so he said, "Jerry, I have a feeling that the child is lost to us for ever, and though I shall leave no means untried to find her, yet I have no hope of success."  "La, now, Mr. Atherton!" answered Jerry, in his turn becoming comforter, "I shall sarch, and sarch, and I'll rout out the whole city of York, every man, woman, or child of them, but I'll find her; and I'll tell you what," continued ihe doubling up his great fist, and the fire absolutely flashing from his eyes," I shouldn't like to be the fellar that carried her off, cause as how he'll catch it; I say for't, if he .don't.

Soon after Sybil had been carried away for the night, the dingy room was filled with a number of men and women, whose very presence would have been pollution to her--but none of the noise of those profane night orgies reached the quiet sleeper above; and though the air of the house reeked with the smell of coarse tobacco and coarser liquor, yet, in that little attic, a broken pane of glass admitted the pure breath of heaven and so, amid all the noxious influences Sybil slumbered on unharmed. The success with which Sybil had met in her first shop- ping, was a matter of much pride to Nancy; and she de- tailed it in full to her assembled companions. No one ex- hibited so much delight as Billings. He paid himself more I compliments than any one else seemed inclined to; and finally ended his eulogium by a taunt on the " milksopish- ness " of Brown, which, of course, drew an angry retort. Quarrels between these two were so frequent, that they seemed in no way to disturb the peace of the rest of the party.  They rather regarded it in the light of fun-as two large dogs are set upon each other and made to fight for the amusement of the bystanders. When there seemed to be any prospect that Brown's wrath would lul  l, -ol, with soime taunting word, or half-ceolcealed laugh, would rouse it again --and so there was for to-night a fair prospect that hard( words would come, as they so frequently do, to hard blows, when Nancy interfered. "Must you two be etarlnally quarelling?" she said. "I, for one, am tired to death of it, and will go awayv if there isn't a stop put to it.") "It is Brown's fault, not mine," said Billings, deprecat- ingly. "He's always picking fault with some of us--and   I CHESTINUT WOOD. 203 yet there is no hesitation about using us, when we are wanted to do a job. I go for fair play. Friend or enemy, is mny 1maximl. None of your half way for me. " Brown looked at him steAdily without answering. All the evil passions in his nature-and their name was Legioll -were aw-Iake, aind strugglig for mastery. He looked a if he couild I a-e seized Billings and torn him limlb from 1limbr;but h1e restrla'tied hinimself, and said, with a lov, steady voice, "Nancy is riglt--it is fool's play.

We would not, i re could, follow the plans and acts of that night; ite easy oliy o I' light of the year, and not particularly unlike another if we except a gratulatory vein in the man- ner of hillings, and a remorseful one in Brown. The hour was late when they separated, so late that when Nancy stole soly to her place by the side of Sybil, the morning stars shone dimly in through the window, and the first rays of light stlcanled up the eastern sky.  Alas! there was no morning star to rise over the darkness of Nancy's soul--no beam  of morning to brighten and gladden the long, long light. A child of shame-she was both born and reared to sin; and excepting the tenderness which little Sybil had pro- duced, her life had been one continued lin of crime a nd misery. An immortal soul--but in training for what an eternity! A knock upon her door roused her long before she should have awakened-the   slumber of guilt is  always light-she rose, and cautiously opened it, and to her sur- prise found Billings there. "Hush " he said , putting his finger upon his lip, "I have come up softly, so as not to awaken the rest of the house. Where is old Moll'?" "I don't know," said Nancy, fiightened. "Has any thing happened?" "Yes, but not much.  Only w e must, be  careful. They  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7088-00000108"/> 204         CHESTN UT woD. are out after that child. They have got lhandbills up all e around, offering a monstrous reward-five thousand dollars! and I have seen it--here-in the city." Itr-what?  "Wihy, that great terrible black dog, that came so near eating me up once. I had rather have a dozen constables after ime than that creature-so we must all keep close to- day, particularly the child. Don't let her go down from this rooml. And charge old Moll-but I will see her my- self. You look out, for that young one-it were as good as state prison for life, to have her found here now. It might lead to finding out every thing, you know." "Did you bring a handbill?" asked Nancy. (' No. I tried several times, but some one always seemedct to come in the way. Confound the girl. I wish she was where she came from." ' So do I," answered Nancy, more heartily than was her wont to speak. I told you you were a fool, when yT; u pro.. posed to bring her." 1' No help for it now," said Billings, turning away; "only keep her close--and if you go out, wear different c:.,lthes from what you did on the night you went to get her after we upset. That man Jenkins is a prying fellow, and the reward will set the whole of them upon the scent; let alone him, and he can smell such a thing a lmile off. I in- tend to wear red hair, green spectacles, and black broadcloth for a day or two-there is no such thing as being too care- ful. None of us are safe but Moll; and she is too wicked for the gallows, even." Then with a coarse laugh at his jest, he went carefully again over the stairs. Nancy's first thought was, what could be done to amuseo Sybil during her confinement, for such it seemed to her ; and while she was wondering, her eye fell upon the bookl whichh she had purchased the day before.   CHESTNUT WOOD.         205 Nancy knew her letters, and could spell out a few short words; but as she took this up, and turned over its pages, she found she could make no meaning of its hieroglyphic characters, yet she had a feeling that it would make the day pass more pleasantly for the little prisoner, and she deter- mlined there should be no want of more of the same kind. So she awakened Sybil, and telling her that if she tried to leave her room, somebody would " catch her and whip her, and per- haps kill her,'" she left her trembling with excessive fear, and went in search of old Moll. After she shut the door, she was drawn by an irresistible, curiosity to turn and look through the key-hole, in order to see what Sybil would do when left alone. She was not a little astonished to see her get up from her miserable bed, and kneeling down by it, clasp her little hands, and then the sound of her voice came to the listening girl. The words she used were new and strange to Nancy. They were as hieroglyphical as the printed words in the little book. Nancy had never before heard the accents of prayer, and she had therefore no recognition of the act. When Sybil arose from her knees, her face was bathed in tears, but there was a  gentle, heavenly expression there, which Nancy never forgot. It was the Spirit of God, speak- ing through the voice and look of the child. An hour afterwards, Sybil was very busy reading her new book, to which, as Nancy had surmised, she betook her- self at once for amusement, when she heard a hobbling step Upon the stairs, which she knew at once must be that of old Moll. Her first impulse was to escape, but there was but one door, and at that she soon heard Moll lifting the latch. When she saw her she was too frightened to move, so she sat still, and looked at her with such a piteous look that it would  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7088-00000109"/> 206         CHESTNUT WOOD. have reached the heart, had there been one to reach. Moll's had long since been turned to stone. "So you are up and dressed, you blessed darlint, are you?" she asked, as she closed the door carefully behind her.  ' Well, you are hungry, too, and I have brought a pint of milk and a roll of bread, fit for a princess; see here!" and the old woman set a bottle and a small bundle, done up in brown paper, down in a chair before Sybil. Sybil showed no inclination to touch either; therefore Moll removed the cork, and putting the bottle to her own mouth, seemed to take a pretty copious draught. "Nice-proper nice," she said, smacking her lips as she put it down; " fit for a princess. Ain't hungry, nor thirsty, either?-well, Ican eat, as well as drink; " so saying, she unrolled the paper, and brealJng off a liberal half of the roll, commenced munching it in a most satisfactory manner. Sybil could not have eaten a mouthful if it had been to save her life. All that she could see or think of was that hideous being before her, and that short stump of an arm, which she was in momentary expectation of feeling, for while she was eating, the old woman seemed to amuse herself with shaking this member of her body in a most threatening man- ner at Sybil, and accompanying these motions with awful grimaces. Sybil became faint and cold from fear, as these panto- mimic performances were continued. A word, a sound, any thing but that still room, and that dreadful sight. She could not remove her eyes; she seemed spell-bound. If her grandfather or Aunt Mary had been at the door calling her, she could not have made a movement or uttered a sound. The most deadly nightmare never benumbed the whole fa- culties as did that waking sight. A few minutes more, and Sybil would have fallen insensible; this the old woman per- ceived, and with a chuckling laugh she said-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         207 ' Bites when he doesn't bark sometimes. What is the matter with you, honey, darlint, sweet angel?  A convulsive shudder passed over Sybil; the spell was broken. This once she was saved, but she could not yet have moved or spoken.  She saw the old woman get up, tip up to her mouth the nearly emptied bottle, put in a few large mouthfuls the remainder of the bread, then, as if for the first time, perceiving the book, dart upon it, and hide it within the folds of the ragged shawl she wore upon her neck; but she was hardly conscious of what had passed; she only heard her as she went down stair after stair, with that crippled step. She sat a long time without moving, with her eyes fixed upon the door; but distant and more distant became the sound, and soon to the straining ear of Sybil it had ceased. She could never tell how much time sle passed in this posi- tion ; she only remembered that when she attempted to move she was sore, and in much pain, and could with difficulty throw herself upon her bed. She did not miss her book. Nancy first recalled her to a knowledge of its loss, and even then Sybil could not tell clearly what had become of it. Nancy, when during the day she stole up to assure her- self as to the child's well-being, was not a little alarmed by the condition in which she found her. Sybil was upon her face on the bed, her hands pressed so tightly over it that Nancy had to use force to draw them away. The child was stiff and cold, and there was a vacant stare about her eye which was almost that of a dead person. Nancy thought it must be want of food; she lifted the bottle-it was empty, and only some few   crumbs re- mained of the loaf of bread, so she felt sure she was not hungry. What ails you?" she asked, when she succeeded in arousing Sybil; are you asleep?"  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7088-00000110"/> 208        CHESTNUT WOOD. The child gave a terrified look around the room, but seeing no one but Nancy, she gained courage, and half rais- ing herself, she said- "Where is she? "/She!-who, what are you talking about?" asked Nancy, quite relieved to hear the child speak. "That-that dreadful-- " Sybil shuddered, and could not finish her sentence. "What has frightened you so?" asked Nancy, sitting down, with a kindness which surprised even herself, by Sybil's bed. a Have you seen or heard any thing? ' Sybil covered her face again with both her hands, for she had caught a sight of old Moll once more, entering the room. Nancy saw and understood it, and in a tone neither too kind or respectful, she said: "What do you want here?  "Want-oh, nothing, only to see how the darlint does, shut up here. I was for thinking-she might be lonely, like. There is no harm in that, I hope." "You have scared her most to death, in sonle way; what have you been doing to her? 7 "Does she say so?" asked the old woman, triumph- antly. "No, she don't speak; see bow she trembles. Take yourself off quick." As Moll showed no inclination to com- ply-only came nearer the bed-Nancy rose, and stamping impatiently on the floor, said, "Begone, or I'll-" "You'll what?" asked the woman, putting her one long arm akimbo, and extending the other as far as she could to match it; "what is it you will do, I should just like to know?" "Push you down stairs," answered Nancy, boldly ad- vancing towards Moll. "And get knocked down yourself for your pains; try it," said the creature in a threatening tone.   CHESTNUT WOOD.         209 Nancy's temper was fairly up; she went to the door, and setting it wide open, said: "There-take your choice; go, or I will push you." V Whether the old woman; as she looked at the flushed face and swelling veins of Nancy, felt that in an actual combat she should be the vanquished, and disliked the idea of being so summarily hastened down stairs, or whether she had -' other and more cunning reasons for making a retreat, it Twould be difficult to say, but certain it is she turned away, and Sybil once more heard her descend the stairs. "There! said Nancy, as she slammed the door after hecr. "The next time she plagues you, let me know, and I will pitch her out of the window, if it breaks every bone in her old body. Now, tell me, child, did she strike you, or lh it you in any way? Sybil shook her head, and said, '"She frightens me so.?' "What does she do to you? asked Nancy. "I don't know, she frightens me! "Well, don't be a little fool about it; she won't dare to hurt you, and if she does, only let me know." Sybil hung her head. She felt that Nancy was only half h inld, so she was not sorry when she went out, and she was alone again, though her little frame shook with fear, and she was, with her want of food and her terror, quite exhausted. A very anxious and restless day this proved to Billings. It seemed to him, so active were his fears, that every street and lamp-post held one or more of those handbills which were to him objects of such especial terror, and twice he had, in turning the corner of a street, suddenly come upon the long lank figure of Jerry, who, habited in his country dress, was looking about with keen, scrutinizing eyes, aI a asking some question, Billings did not stay to hear what, of as many persons as he could get to answer him. By his side walked Nep, and a precipitate retreat showed Billings's vivid lmemory of their former meeting.  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7088-00000111"/> 210         CHEaSTNUT WOOV. After t;he second encounter he resolved to secrete him- self in Nancy's house until such imminent danger should be passed, and it was to this fear that Nancy owed a second visit frotm him on the afternoon of thelsame day that he hlad roused her so unceremoniously in the morning. "Conscience makes cowards of us all," and a more timid, anxious band is seldom seen than that which sympalty in criime drew together ill that dark, danmp cellar-kitchen. Brown came in late.  He flung his hat on to the floor, sat down apart from the rest, alnd no one ventured to disturb the gloomy and moody man by a single question. Billings had expected a storm, and was quite satisfied at the pros- pect of escaping withlout one, so he conversed in a low tone with Nancy, taking care that only such subjects as Ymight be agreeable should be introduced. But all the care was in vain. The very pains which he took to avoid a subje ct which they all ihad nearest at heart, served only to exasperate Brown, who at last broke out with, "Why don't you talk of what you are thinking, Billings? It is no way to rid one's self of a halter to shut your eyes, and pretend you' don't see it when it, is around your neck. It will hang you, man, just as surely as if you-looked at it." There was something in the image suggested which was particularly displeasing to Billings, for he said, in a surly voice, "Who was talking about hanging? Not I." "But you had better be," interrupted Brown, "or else doing something to get out of this confounded scrape. Where is the child?" "Up stairs, safe as a bird in a cage," answered Billings, relieved to find it was not really of the gallows they were to speak, " and safe like to be, notwithstanding the five thousand dollars." Old Moll rose from her seat, and came a little nearer--   CHESTNUT WOOD.         2" she had for the first time heard of the reward. No one no- ticed the action, and Brown went on: "The handbills are posted all over the city. One would think every witch in the world had been at work, so quickly has it been done. The wh]ole police force is on the alert. That Jenkins that came up the night you upset and got into that row, llas remembered the child, and is willing to swear to the identity. He remembers you too, Billings, thouggh you thought you were off in the crowd before he had a chance to see you. And Nancy he has described to the police, so that if she sets her foot out of doors she will be nabbed. To-morrow will bring the old man himself down, for that long Yankee has already sent back the report of the police officer, and if he comes 1 shall be suspected, and if once on my trail he has stored up vengeance enough against me to ferret me out, if I were in the bowels of the earth, and he should walk over the spot, and this is what we have all got by this -confounded piece of unnecessaryy"-- "Humph!" said Billings, but wisely stopped with that ejaculation. Brown took no notice oflhim, but went on to say : "Something mlust be done. I must be off for one, and whether I succeed in making my escape is a matter of much doubt, for that reward makes as many vigilant eyes as it contttins dollars. One fifth part of that money might once"- Brown stopped suddenly, put his hand to his head, but re- collecting himself, went on with forced calmness--"At any rate I shall try for it to-night. If I succeed-well, and if not, let each one look out for himself. I shan't peach--of that you may be sure. "For the child-keep her close. To have her found now would be our certain ruin-but," and he fixed his eyes upon Nancy with a look which tried to read her soul, " mind that you treat her well--kindly--- like a lady as she is. Mind, I'  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7088-00000112"/> CHESTNUT WOOD. say," and his voice slightly trembled-" for if not, as sure as there is an injury of any kind--clay kind: do you hear me! inflicted upon her, I will hunt you up and revenge it-and that too, terrib/y!" His breath came hard-lhis eyes glared fearfully-and every one, even to old TMoll, trembled. He saw his advantage, and coming close to Nancy, said: "Swear to me, woman! that you will be kind to tlat child." "I swear," said Nancy, folding her hands in the manner she had been accustomed to, when taking an oath of secrecy. "Swear again," said Brown. "I swear," said Nancy, solemnly. "Swear once more, and as you keep your oath so be it done unto you." "I swear," repeated Nalncy, in the same slow, measured tone. "Now for you, Billings," said Brown, moving away from before Nancy, and drawing himself up to his full height as lie confronted the dastard--"You are a liar and a coward. I could no more trust your oath than your word, but-you understanid me-dare to do otherwise, and sooner or later I shall find you out. Beware! I say inow-beware!" Without another word he took up his hat and slowly went from the room. Behind, he left bitter hatred and deep ali- mlosities-with him, he took remorse-but. alas! no )cpzi- tence. For the ensuing week the city was excited by the report of the lost child. Mr. Atherton had. as Brown suspected, come immediately to the city, upon hearing of Jerry's suc- cess, and most active and vigorous measures were put on foot to unravel the mlystery. But those with whom they had to deal were old offenders, and had not entered upon the game without first counting the cost. Nancy and Billings kept almost entirely at home. If they ventured out at all,   CHESTNUT W'OOD.   213   it was only after dark, and then special pains was taken that their disguises should be often changed, and should be perfect. In the mean time, although Sybil had been kept close prisoner in the little attic, Nancy had been as good as her word, and had been kind to her. She had brought her her meals herself, and had seldom left her-so that Sybil had not seen old Moll at all-and although the child pined much for her home, and shed many silent tears, yet she was neither demonstrative nor intrusive with her grief, and therefore won both upon the respect and affection of Nancy. "No one can be wholly bad." Nancy had always felt, before little Sybil came among them, that she was shut out from God and man; that there was not in her a vestige of that humanity which smiled and looked happy, -as she passed it in the street-for her no friend-no Sabbath--no heaven-no God. "Without God, and without hope in the world," Nancy was only one of many such, poor thing! But this child-this blessed child-what a new life her gentle voice--her loving, tender words awakened. How passively, but how pleased Nancy would sit in that room, and listen to her and go away, and yet feel that she must come back. Why, Nancy did not ask herself, she only went and listened. At the end of a week the city marshal had made up his mind that there was no such child in the city-that if she had been brought there she must have been immediately taken away; and he relaxed his efforts to discover her, at the same time informing Mr. Atherton to what conclusion he had come, but Mr. Atherton had his own private reasons for believing otherwise; and though he went himself back to Chestnut Wood, he deputed Jerry to remain and continue his search as carefully as ever; but Jerry, though very use- ful in the country, was by no means as acute and sensible  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7088-00000113"/> CHESTNUTr k WOO D O here every thing was new to him, and he was so constantly 1posed upon that hle came to the very sagacious decision [at if Palmy Fitch were once to be put down in New York tere would be no living with her afterwards, for she would ::i? would be 3spise mankind too mulch to mnake it at all confortable.

A. intuitive sense of propriety, and delicacy, had always been her most charming traits, and the bold gaze of that bad mlan, filled her, she could not tell why, with anger and sUlrprise. She rose from her seat, as he entered, with the air of a tragic queen, and with t[ toss of her head, and a flash from her bright eye, haughtily  demanded ' what he wished . "  Billings was abashed for a momnent, but only for one; conll- ing up to her, he attempted to kiss her, at the same time saying, D(on't be cross, Child.

Sybil's lip curled-the color flew intoeher face, and witlh- out one particle of fear she said, wit}x an air of authority which Billings found it difficult to resist--' Leave me this moment, or I will scream to Nancy.

"She has been gone out of the house this half hour, so you may as well be plea- sant, and sit down, and have a nice talk with me. Come, you don't know how much I love you."  He attempted to take the  child's hand, but with the quickness of lightning she darted by him, down one pair of stairs, then another, and another. She did not think where, or wherefore, she only wanted to imake her escape. In one of the halls, tlhe door stood open that led into the street. She had no bon- net--she never remembered it-but flew down the steps, and found herself once more in the busy, noisy city-bitt alone e! Billings had followed her as fast as his unsteady step would allow. He reached the hall door, in time to see her running swiftly, with her long curls flying in the wind, away; he watched her a moment, she had turned a corner, and was lost to sight. Sobered instantly, he saw what his own folly had done. Long as she had been shut up in the attic, Nancy had never forgotten to turn the key upon the door; and yet all this caution when Sybil, not knowing herself imprisoned, would never have thought of an escape. Now, lie shad by his rudeness not only suggested the thing, but had also given the opportunity for its performance, and as he drew himself back, out of sight, he felt that he had been his own betrayer, and must now effect his escape without an instant's further delay.  He determined not to await the return of Nancy, but to leave her to suppose, that she had forgotten to lock the door, and Sybil had improved the time of her absence to Looling all round himn to make sure that Nancy was not, near to observe him, he slunk away with a much more self-condemlnatory feeling, than he was accustomed to be conscious of possessing.

"KE a caged bird, suddenly let loose, whose drooping heart and weary wing had almost forgotten the bright sunshine. and pure air, Sybil, after the first effort at escape, found herself with terror alone in the great streets of the stranger city. She did not slacken her pace but slightly.  She dared not look behind her. She pressed on-on, she knew or thought not whither. Many people stopped to look at her, as she went. Some called after her, but most forgot her, 'with the glance they gave, as she flew by.   As the ,walks became more and more crowded, her pace was inter- rupted, and soon she was so closely wedged in, by men, women, and children, that she found it difficult to make her iway, even slowly, forward. She suddenly became conscious that she was without covering, and with the ready instinct of her sex, she took off her dark calico apron, and pinned it over her head. She then drew it down over her face, and thus carefully concealing the long curls and beautiful face from ,sight, walked quickly on-quietly to all external appearance --but within that little breast, who shall say what violent emotions strove with the timid child.

Not one of all the hundreds that she saw, recognized the lost child. She was still, like the suddenly freed bird, desolate and alonle in the great city; The crowd had grown less and less.   She hlad passed finom the thoroughfares to the more retired part of New York, but she scarcely ceecded the ch1ange. In her ears, rang the sounds of wheels and the distant tramp of innuller. able feet. Her eyes were dim with anxious gazing; her feet refused to carry her further, so seating herself upon the steps of a-house, she began to cry bitterly. Not a sound did she utter, the tears came from the deep fountains of utter despair, and each fresh gush seemed to obliterate whatevcr remained of hope and trust.

She felt sure it must be this same star, and'she resolved to follow it, with a. lhalf poetical, half real hope, that it, too, might lead her to where she should find rest and safety. Dear child!--led by light from heaven--pure and holy such a guide; alas-! that as we go on in life, the mists and clouds obscure our vision, and for us seldom arises that glorious eastern star! Sybil heard, as she passed by many houses, the sound of happy voices. There were parents and children gather- ing together for the words of kindness, before parting for the night; there were fathers coming homle, and welcomes loud and cheerful. The air seemed filled with homne voices, but they fell coldly on the ear of the little wanderer. There was not, in one of them all, a recognition of her. Her reception at the only dwelling at which she had dared to stop was so unkind that she would rather be out with the stars than again hear such rough words, so, worn and weary, faint, sick, and full of pain, the child followed the moving star. If for a moment it was hidden behind a large building, or the spreading branches of some tree, she did not go back to find it, but with a quickened step, and an eye fixed upon the point where it shhould appear, she hastel'cd on until it was once more in sight.  Fortunately for Sybil, fatigue again overpowered her, so 'that she could not see that star set; she sank down once more, unable to proceed, but she had left the suburbs of the city, and now under a tree, with her eye fixed, as long as she could keep it open, upon the star, she fell asleep.  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7088-00000117"/> 222        CHESTNUT WOOD. A sound awakened her, and on opening her eyes, she saw that night was gone, that the sun was shining brightly, and that directly opposite her on the road a cart had stopped, and a iman was slowly getting out from it. She tried to rise, but could not, and the lman, keeping hi's eyes fixed upon 1her, and seeing her ineffectual attempt, said, "Little girl, what are you doing? Have you been here all night?" There was something kind in the voice of the man, but a strange face gave a feeling of alarm to Sybil now, and she looked at him without answering. "Say, child, " said the man, going up still nearer, ai ld looking her steadily in the face, "1 have you been here all night? Why don't you go home?" I' am going," said Sybil, a little encouraged by his voice "Where do you live?" Sybil did not wish to tell; she felt that she was entirely in his power, and sle dreaded being taken back to New-  York; so, after a moment's silence, she only said, "At my grandfather s. .

Her head was so hot, and her temples throb.  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7088-00000118"/> 924        CHESTNUT WOOD. bed so violently, that he was alarmed, and as soon as she be.  came quiet, he lifted her into his market cart, and mnaking for her a bed of the large warm overcoat, which his early morning visits to the city, with vegetables, obliged him to carry constantly with himn, he whispered to her ' not to tallk, but to try to go to sleep, while he drove quickly homne.*' Sybil was not inclined to disobey; she lay down upon tho coat, and fixing her large eyes upon him, seemed perfectly content. Gently as a mother would care for a sickl child, he covered her from the brisk morning air, and even his con- stant urging of his horse was done in a subdued tone. The motion of the cart was exceedingly painful to Sybil; once or twice she uttered a slight groan. It went to the good man's heart,-and half distracted between the wish to reach home quickly, and yet drive so as to make as little motion as he could, he more than once checked the horse with the determination of getting out, and carrying the child in his arms. But Charlton was yet fall five miles distant-- not-to be reachled on foot, with such a burden, for at least two hours. Two hours!  They seemed to him like tNo years. While casting his eyes uneasily about the cart, with  the wonder what could be done to make it more com- fortable, he saw, what in his excitement he had before en- tirely forgotten, his bright little tin pail, which his good wivf had put in over night containing the first breakfast,-the second being always smoking upon the table as he drove into the yard. What a treasure!-the good man would not at that mo- ment have exchanged it for this same pail filled with the purest gold. To check his horse, and spread its contents before the suffering child, was but the work of an instant-- and 'Sybil saw the whitest bread, and the most tempting bit of pie-but alas! not tempting to her now. She tried to eat-but she could not; and in a faint voice she asked for   CHESTNUT WOOD.         225 water.  Perhaps she bad heard the little brook that went singing by them where they stood,--perhaps, as she raised her head, her eye had caught a glimpse of the bright drops glowing like little stars in the sunlight. "Dear Papa Wallace! take me out," she said. It is so-so long since I have seen the brook; let me drink it- let me put it on my head. I am very hot-oh, it will do me so much good." And so the child leaned over the little stream, and the cooling waters ministered to her, as had the evening star! When she was put back in the wagon, she was much re- freshed, and seemed inclined to talk; but "Papa Wallace-," though very anxious to have the mystery solved, was too good a nurse to allow her to excite herself; and wheni spite of his gentle prohibition, she did tell m how s/uuenty she had been stolen away from Chestnut 'Wood, he thought slshe was wandering, and forced her to be quiet. How long these five miles seemed.  Many and many a time had Mr. Wrallace passed over them ; but they had been to him as :- only the link that bound together the two necessary parts of his labor--the garden, and the mnJaret-stall. He was so fhmiliar with every' hill, every stone, every way-mark, that they had ceased to have for him any existence. Now, for the first time for many years, he recognized them all, they seemed to put that much wished for home only at a greater distance, and then he was obliged to drive so much more slowly than usual, it appeared to him as if he should nev- cr reach there. But the house soon came in sight, just I where he had left it, though he had begun almost to believe it must have been spirited away to some remote region during his absence; and there at the gate stood his good wife, looking anxiously up the road in the direction in which he was coming. She wondered that he should bedriving so leisurely, VOLT,.

To be sure it was nicely kept--but then how was he to know that? Ste began to be impatient when she saw that he was safe, and without waiting for him to come up to the door, turned to go into the house. "Wife! wife!" she heard him call, " stop a minute;  but the horse's pace was not at all quickened; and so, af- ter fully satisfying herself that that was the fact, she once more put her hand upon the door-latch. 'i Wife! wife!  she- heard again-and this time he was nearer, so that she could distinguish the earnestness of the-tone. If the horse had stood still now, so would she. An unusual tone in the voice of one we love, has great power over us; it says more than the words it conveys; and before the wagon was fairly atthe:' door, Mrs.,Wallace was prepared for some strange thing;. So she peeped into it when it stopped, and when her eyes met those of Sybil, and she heard"I Maima Wallace,' she neither screamed nor evinced any of her common methods of indicating surprise; she only said, looking from Sybil to her husband, "John!'what does this mean-?" but at the same time she had lifted the child from the old overcoat in her great, loving arms, and was kissing her first on her forehead, then on her cheeks, and then on her dry, burning lips. "Where did she come from? The child has fever-see how she looks! Why, Sybil, darling child, what is the mat- ter with you?" The child's head had sunk slowly but heavily upon her neck. The little heart fluttered for a moment tumultuously against her own warm, motherly one; and when alarmed at her growing weight, and her silence, she raised her head, she saw that she had fainted. It was no time now for inq-uiries, and it was not until the unconscious stati-.ad been exchanged for one of deli- riU,P nnmd e-ve Itry  that could be before the nril   CHESTNUT WOOD.         227 of a physician, that Mrs. Wallace had time to ask, ' where she had been found?" Strange as it may seem, the news of the disappearance of Sybil from Chestnut Wood had not reached the ears of the Wallaces. They lived a very retired, quiet. life; Mr. Wallace in his daily visits to the city, neither hearing of nor thinking about any thing not connected with his stall; and excepting the occasional intercourse of a visit from Charles to Hymeswold, during his short vacations, nothing was seen or heard from there during the year. We must do Mrs. Wallace either the justice, or the injustice to say, that not- withstanding  all Mr. Atherton's subsequent kindness to them and their son, she had never quite forgotten or for- given her first. and only visit to him; and although she had always retained the liveliest affection for the little orphan Sybil, yet she had regarded her as one who was for ever sep- arated from her, and had accustomed herself to think of her anlmost as she would of a child whose little grave had been made in some distant land, so distant that she could not plant flowers upon it. After hearing what her husband had to- communicate, f she formed her own conclusions as to what had been the occasion of Sybil's being found alone and desolate upon the highway. She surmised that her treatment at home had been harsh, perhaps even violent, and that the child, abused beyond  the power of the little heart to endure, which she remembered as proud as well as fond, had run away from the tyranny which she was unable to resist. In her having been found as she had by her husband, Mrs. Wallace recognized an all- protecting Hand; and now as she stood by the unconscious sufferer, chafing her temples and soothing her, as only a mother can soothe, her warm heart was filled with gratitude that again she had been permitted to save so precious a life precious to her, and," she said, kissing the red cheek,  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7088-00000120"/> 228        CHESTNUT WOOD.  But poor Sybil could not thank her for her love,--she  could neither see nor hear the boys, as they gathered one by one, with soft steps, around the bed, and tried to recognize in the little, still figure, their "sister Sybil." Charles was away, still at school. He had done well, as well as his  fondest friends could wish; even Mr. Atherton had declared himself satisfied, and the promise of the boy was a subject, on which his teachers loved to dilate; for Charles had given the greatest proof of his capabilities that a boy can give, that of securing the respect and affection of his teachers.  He was the pride of Mrs. Wallace's life: the realization of many an ambitious dream, of which no one, not even her own husband, had even known her guilty. In the future, he was to be all, and how much that one little word colm- prised, that a mother's heart could ask. Now, as she watched over Sybil, there stole into her mind, she could hardly tell why, many thoughts of him; and in the grief and indignation which he would feel when he should hear what had taken place, she almost forgot her own-but it all tend- ed to confirm her in the resolution which she had early taken: to conceal Sybil's being with them entirely from the family at Chestnut Wood, until she could, in a most satis- factory manner, have the whole matter fully explained. She,  therefore, cautioned her husband and the physician, not to mention the child's being with her, and forbade her children making any allusion to it at school, or at play, among the children of the village; and thus having taken every pre- caution in her power, she set herself in earnest to nursing and saving the child. Sybil talked much about the star; so  much, that in after years Mrs. Wallace, keeping it all freshy  stored in her memory, was tempted to think the child had l been then suffering from an attack of insanity, not so much  owing to any bodily indisposition as to a wrong mental or- ganization.    CHAPTER XV. ON the evening of the daywhen the advertisement of Sybil's disappearance from Chestnut Wood was first seen by the men so nearly concerned in it, we have already spoken of Moll's attention being called to it, and her curiosity being shown by her exchanging her seat for one nearer the speaker. Since that time, Moll had been busy in devising plans, no suspicion of which, she took great pains, should come to Nancy's mind. For some hours of every day, as she sat in her accustom- ed seat, under one of the trees in the Park, selling apples and pea-nuts to whomever she could tempt to buy, she tried to spell out, letter'by letter, one of the handbills, of which she had made herself the possessor. Sometimes, by means of the bribe of an apple, or a handful of nuts, she would in- duce a child who could read, to repeat its contents to her, and so, in a few days, she could make it all out for herself. If she saw any one observing her, she would immediately hide it, and busy herself in the rearrangement of her eatables, -r, holding out the short arm, in a whining tone beseech "for the good Lord's sake, a little charity." To those whose hlome, or business, led them that way, she had become well known, and the old deformed apple-woman was as necessary a part of the Park as the trees themselves. To them she  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7088-00000121"/> 3C0 ifE:'TUT 0W OOD.  never seemed to have but one expression to her hideous face, and that was of hypocrtical misery. Sometimes she had been caught, as she made change for the gentlemen who  bought her applesf, with a look of intense delight and eun- ing as she mumubled over the sixpences she was to pay back, E but not often; her features had almost become stereo-  typed into those of an artful beggar, and as such she was  best known.   Several tiimes she had been arrested as a partaker in  some crime which lad been committed in the city; but H nothing could ever be clearly proved against her, and she  had escaped. She seemed, as Billings ha d aid of er, to  i be too bad, even for the gllows bt she ad made hrself so necessary to her companions, in o ny guilty scemes,  that they had not felt they could rid themselves of her.. . One morning she was missing from her accustomed sea  in the Park. Hardly one passed without noticing the fact, though no one gave a second thought to it; no one in the wide world would have missed Moll had she never been seen again.  On that same morning, eIoll had risen at her usual early  hour from the heap of old clothes in the corner of e closet  which made her bed, and with more care than she was wont to show, had exchanged her soiled and torn apron for a neater and more tidy one. She had put on an old-fashioned black bonnet; a large, brown shawl, well patched, but whole; and had hidden the clothes w1ich she took off in the very mniddl of that bundle which no other living being could have been tempted to unroll. Then, taking the basket conl taining her small- articles of merchandise, sh had stolen stealthily away' The basket w as not carriedfar. She had been accustomed to'store it *. the corner of a grocer elar, while engaged in othier business during the day, and thither now she bent her way. The man expressed no surprise   CHESTNUT WOOD.          231 when he saw her enter so early. He asked no question; he did not like to be asked them; and he had, at least, the merit in this one thing, of doing as he would be done by. He thought he heard the old woman mutter something, as she left the store; but as she did not directly address him, hoe still took no notice of her. That basket was never called for; yet for years it stood in the same corner until the sem- blance even of the apples had disappeared. And he never touched it-never considered it as belonging to any one but the old creature who had deposited it there. Perhaps, as Moll turned away from the door, there was a slighrt struggle in her mind. If there was, it was the first she had known for years, and the last. Certain it is, after going to a little distance from the shop, she returned to it, and put her fingers upon the latch, but she did not raise it; she turned quickly away, and said, "  Dog! am I?-old hag! am I?-cross, amr I?-vixen, am I?-beast! am I? Sworn at, cursed, kicked, beaten, insulted. Well, well, bite as well as bark; some teeth left yet," and the old creature grinned most horribly, and in so doing exposed to view two fangs, long, straight, but very yellow-all that remained of a for- mer fine set of teeth. It was still so early that the streets were very empty. So much the better for her; she was only afraid in a crowd; so, still with the grin upon her face, she bent her body forward, and seemed most carefully to adjust all her muscles to the exercise of walking. On the after- noon of the day -old Moll was seen thus making her way through the streets of the city, Sybil was flying down the same, with her long golden hair streaming behind her. That night they both reached the country-Sybil, after wandering weary hours around and around -the great city, and 'Moll before the sun had risen an hour high in the heavens. Fortunately they were upon different roads, for a meeting between the two now, in the excited state of Sybil's  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7088-00000122"/> 232        CHESTNUT WOOD. nervous system, might have proved fatal to her. For Moll there is no guiding star in the sky; she never looked up, and farther and farther yet shall her path diverge from the little heaven-directed child. The country was new to Moll. For years she had not   h been tempted, beyond the precincts of the city, and she hobbled on, mumbling to herself, as she became slowly con-:. : scious of the different world in which she now was. The birds were singing blithely, but not a sound of all their  happy music penetrated within her deafened ear. Tile earth : was teeming with sights, and sounds of life and beauty, but "the mind makes its own place," and in Moll's soul there was no sunshine, no song, no external world. Excepting that she-missed the noise of city streets-that a lonely deso- late sensation crept over her-she might as well have been sitting under the tree in the dusty Park. Mile after mile, without changing her pace-up-hill and down-now through  the still streets of the little- village, where a solitary manl  turned around to look at the strange pauper, or a busy house-  wife leaned upon her broom, beside the window, to make sure that she went by without coming in,- or a cur ran after and barked inhospitably at her heels, and now over long reaches of dusty unshaded turnpike, relieved only occasionally by a small patch of woods. Through all this, without making a  single inquiry, or turning her head to notice a single object, Moll took her silent way. She had only one purpose-thflat, cost what it might, she was determined to accomplish. Three days after Sybil and Moll left the city, Mr. Atherton was sitting alone in his library. He was not occu- pied, at least not visibly. He sat leaning back in his large arm-chair, with his hand over his face, and the lines about his mouth unusually stern and rigid, when a knock upon his window made him start and look up. Standing directly be- fore it, looking him steadily in the face, was a figure such as y    CHESTNUT WOOD. le never remembered to have seen before. It was an old woman, dusty and travel-stained, if any thing could be said to add an additional stain to the garments she wore. Mr. Atherton only noticed an old black bonnet, and a face with the most diabolical expression he ever saw. Startled, h motioned her authoritatively to go away, but upon this, being sure that she vas noticed, she began to make many expres- sive gestures, such as putting her hand to her mouth, and then attempting to raise the window. Still hIr. Atherton only motioned her awai , and seeing that she showed no in- clination to obey, he was about to ring and order John out, to enforce compliance, when a loud barking, and at the same time blows and oaths, caused him to hurry to the window' Nep, who had returned with Jerry from New-Yorik the day before, had sprung upon the woman, and she seemed in im- minent danger of being torn in pieces. Nor was his anger at all lessened by the kicks and abuse which he received. Mr. Atherton saw there was not a moment to be lost, and tiring up the window, could hardly prevail upon the dog to loosen his hold upon the woman. As soon as Nep did so without seeming at all alarmed, she approached  tr. Ather- ton, and waith a low curtsey, and the whine peculiar to her, said  "Your dog is almost as  hospitable as his master. I have comle far to speak to you." 'Go away, quickly!   woman, " answered M r. Atherton. "Make haste!--I can scarely keep this dog from fying at you ,again. Be still, Nep; down sir-be quiet, I say " Nep growled ominously, but crouched at his m aster's "Och, and indaad, it's send Ime away you vill, yo u w ill,' i ined  the wnoman, or-your dog  will tear me to pieces; ugly brute, and sh e returned Nep's look  with one ually f erocious, and certainly not as intelligent. "Well,  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7088-00000123"/> 234         CHESTNUT WOOD, . it's go away I will, and some future day you may remember this. Yes, away; oh, indeed, it's back I'll go, and who then  will be the loser, think you, Mr. Atlerton " she asked,  ^ suddenly raising her head, dropping the whine, and speakingir lile another person.  ": Here! if it's money you want, woman," and Mr. Ather. ton held out silver; "take it, and begone. I shall not try to keep this dog still much longer." "And if it's money I want," said Moll, taking the piece, what is it that you want? Something that all your money cannot buy." "I want nothing, woman " and the window of the li- brary went down with a violence which made the woman re. treat a few steps; but in a moment she was there again, beckoning and talking as before. l Now, I say for't," Mr. Atherton heard a voice say. "What in the world is this ; where did you come from " and Jerry stood before the window, by the side of the old wonan. "' None of my business, eh? ' Well, now, perhaps it ain't,  and then agin perhaps it is. What do you want? 'None  of my business,' again. That ar' is what I call sarsy, and i we don't trade in that sort of stuff down here at Chestnut Wood. Perhaps you may as well carry your goods to another market. Shan't go?' Well, now, perhaps you won't,  and then again perhaps you will; there is no saying what you can do, if you try hard. See Mr. Atherton?' Well, there he is," said Jerry looking in through the window. It's cheap looking at him through glass, but he ain't fold  of being specticled; so, as you have seen him, perhaps you  had better go. 'W1on't stir a step?' You're a tough one; perhaps that big dog, Nep, can help you a little," and here with commenced a series of very quick whistles, the hearing of which Nep, as if he knew what was wanted of him, only acknowledged by short knocks with his tail upon the floor,   CHESTNTUT WOOD.         235 though his eye was very eagerly asking leave to go of his master. The old woman looked for a moment in a fiightened mnanner around her, but she knew where the dog was, better than Jerry, and his threat had no other effect upon l1er.  "  If he comes, he will tear you into strings, like a rib- bin; you had better make tracks. 'Stay here till the day of judgment? ' Well, old crittur, it's well you know there is such a time, cause you ain't a m6mnent to spare in getting ready for it. "Come, Mr. Atherton has seen your pictur long enough, if you have got a glass frame," and here Jerry laughed heartily at his own joke. "I guess he'll excuse me if I take you down, and carry you off. Budge along." Except- ing the short answers which Jerry had so laconically repeated after her, the old woman had sat in sullen silence, but sud- denly a new thought seened to occur to her. "Tell your master," she said, looking with a look Jerry could not interpret, steadily in his face, ' that the next time lie wishes old Ioll, he may seek her; and here, return to himn this money, and say, I came not for one, but for a t/ousadidg dollars, and that he would give ne twice over for what I know; " then, returning to her whining tone, she con- tinued, "Och! and a shame it is, it is, to turn away a poor soul, nor even so much as give her a civil hearing. To tear cir and frighten her with a big brute of a dog, and not even o nmuch as a thank for her pains; .a sin and a shame it is, t is;" so saying, with an ominous shake of her short arm icarcr to Jerry's face than he was accustomed to see, she lobbled off. "The roaring lion!" ejaculated Jerry, as he watched cr go, "  only she has it on the upper, instead of the lower )art of her body; what chance on that little bit of an arm  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7088-00000124"/> 236         CIESTNUT WOOD. for a cloven foot. I dare say it was there, only I didn't happen to see it; it took me all aback so. If that don't beat all natur!" Jerry had a great mind to go in, and tell Mr. Atherton about the woman, but he must return to the city to-morrow, and had many little jobs to do before lie could go; so he wisely went about them, and left the tallking until after dark. But there was something in the old weo man which he could not banish from off his mind. Tlhe harder he worked, the more distinctly he seemed to see her, and that diabolical little arm became, at last, actually rounded off by the cloven foot. le felt uncomfortable; never was mortal man more free from fear, but then it was only of mortal foes; and the more he thought of this, the more sure he felt of the actual presence of the Evil One. He almost forgot Sybil; he worked away mechanically, yet did manly strokes, even so. He was recalling every word and look, and how he had dared to answer; and he felt the perspiration rolling in great drops off his face. He thought it was because he was lifting, with so mnuch strength, the huge stones that he wanted to place for the beginning of a wall. It was in fact, but it was also those cold drops which fear calls out, on the bravest'of us, sometimes. "Hang it " said he, suddenly dropping the bar with which he was tugging away at the stone. 'I ain't afraid of a thousand like her, nor of-not--no, not even the great roarer himself, unless I was caught doing a sin, and there's no sin in honest work. I'm troubled about Sybil; and every thing makes a child on me, and somehow, I have got it into my head, that this crittur in the little black bonnet, with that awful arm, has somewhat to do with her; no harm at any rate, in talking to Mr. Atherton about it, so I will just go and see him." On his way thither, Jerry revolved in his mind every thing which he could to give Mr. Atherton as a reason for his suspicions, and   C-irETNUT WOOD.        237 when he remembered the one thousand dollars, which she said she had come for, and the strange act of a beggar re- turning what had been already given her, he felt as if he had a certain clue to the spot where Sybil was. In his haste to reach Mr. Atherton, he forgot the common civilities of the house, and entered the library without knocking, and with his hat upon his head. Mr. Atherton looked at him with unfeigned surprise, but before he had time to speak, Jerry had broken out with "'That-that-that old roaring lion." Mr. Atherton rose alarmed, he thought Jerry had become suddenly insane; but without heeding him, Jerry went on: "I mean that old woman knows where Sybil is." Jerry!" "Yes, I verily believe she does. She said she came for a thousand dollars, and you-would give more than that to know what she knows-the old cloven-footed wretch, that she is!' "What has become of her?" "Don't know, nor can't tell; 'going about seeking whom she may devour,' I suppose. She looks as if she could have eaten the child all up, at one big mouthful." "Jerry, come to your senses, and tell me what you mean by all this nonsense" demanded Mr. Atherton, sternly. "Well now," said Jerry, rubbing his head violently, to set his ideas straight if he could, "I mean this "-and then, he detailed all of their conversation, in as intelligible a man- ner as he was able. When Jerry had thus unceremoniously entered the library, Mr. Atherton had been thinking of this same old woman. He was so far removed from the life of the city now, that very few paupers found their way to his door. Indeed, he could not recollect ever having seen one at Chest-  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7088-00000125"/> 238        CIWESTNUT WtOOD.  nut Wood before; and from the peculiar air and tones of old Moll, he at once recognized the accomplished city beg- gar. What could have brought her there, and why, after his very liberal gift, she still persisted in remaining, were  matters of some curiosity and wonder to him. In an unac- countable way, he too was beginning to link her appearance with Sybil's disappearance, when Jerry's story confirmed his half-awakaned suspicions. "Let us not lose one mo- ment in finding her," he said, "only shut up Ncp. 1Ie seemed as if he would have torn her in pieces." ' The dog has a soul. I know he scents the roaring.--I beg your pardon, Mr. Atherton, but somehow I can't get it out of my head, that she is-is-why, not a very good wo. man. Did you see her arm, sir?  "No, but I saw enough to know she is both wicked and ugly. Now, to our search; buk first let me speak to Miss Rogers.  he may return to the house, while we are gone; and it is best that she should know all that we do." "She won't be back-she went off mad as a March hare, and said you mighit hunt her up when you wanted her; thel old crittur, that she is. She will make terrible scarce of herself, particularly if she really has any thing to tell us. Well, we can hunt her up, and she ain't far off, withi tfho ' old hobbling limbs, I know." In two hours, Mr. Atherton and Jerry again miet. They had been up and down the road; through the cart-paths in the wood, and Jerry had most diligently searched all the out buildings. Moll was not to be found. "Now, I say for't," said Jerry, as he heard of 31r. Atherton's ill success. ' If this 'ere Chestnut Wood dont beat all natur' for'swallowing up people, then I don't know. There was Sybil lost once, and a terrible time we had to search her up. Then, off she goes again, and there's no sich thing as finding her; and then, here comes this twful   239 old crittur, whom it don't matter whether sheo"was ever found or not; as a general thing, nobody wants her, and all of a sudden she disappears. Why, it's jist as if the earth turned into pit holes, and the like. If you didn't live here, M-r. Atherton, I should be for thinking it was a sort of a Sodom and Gomorrah.  Ill luck take the varmint ; the woman, I mean, not the place!" After a little consultation, it was agreed that the vagrant, whomever she might be, would not be very likely to leave the place, without another attempt to see Mr. Atherton, and it was determined to let the night go over, without making any further attempt to discover her, Mr. Atherton having rather an annoying feeling, that she had been hid- den, and had amused herself by watching their fruitless search. Still, anxious hours, in spite of the apathy which he so much courted, intervened before the light of the next morning. The war between the head and the heart, be- tween Xthe strong self-reliance and the gentle pleadings of an affectionate, wounded nature, was fierce and long. Now the waves of feeling beat against a rock, and now nothing was left to struggle with the waters but the feeble grasp of a nerveless hand upon a straw. Jerry was surprised, upon reaching Palmy Fitch' at his accustomed hour, to find the little gate carefully tied up with a rope, which he sometimes used as a halter for Dob- bin. It was wound around and around so many times, that he came to the conclusion, some sudden whim had induced Miss Palmy to go out to take tea; and having forgotten to tell hilm, she had taken all this precaution, to prevent any intrusion of the neighbors' too neighborly cows into her bit of a garden; but when he had carefully untied it, and reached the door, what was his astonishment, to find that locked also- "La!" he said, giving his hat the customary knock back,  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7088-00000126"/> 240        CHESTNUT WO)OD.  it ain't the first time I have been locked out, but then it's  only jist tea-time now, and I am as punctual as the town clock." While he was looking about, not exactly knowing what to do for that important meal, which he seemed so likely to lose, he saw the little curtain of Miss Pally's bed- room window carefully drawn aside, and the next moment, the pug nose, and sharp eye, of the lady herself, peeping out from behind it, were visible, but no other part of her person. Encouraged by this partial glimpse of his landlady, he came up to the window, and began calling her, in no very gentle voice; in honest truth, even Jerry obstinate good nature was not quite proof agtst so uncalled-for a reception. But the nose and the eye quickly disappeared; the curtain was once more drawn closely, and after a delay, which tired Jer- ry's patience to its utmost, he heard the bolt withdrawn, and the latch lifted. "' Oh, Jerry!" said Miss Palmy, without waiting to give him an opportunity to ask a question, "I a so glad to see you." She made a sudden motion towards him, which in a younger and fairer person, might have sug- gested a reception not altogether displeasing to Jerry, but checking herself, as if a dim idea of what it might lead to, had dawned upon her mind, she said, "Come in quick, and let me bolt it!                     i  "La! now, Miss Palmy, what in natur' is to pay; you ain't skeered any, are you?" "Almost to death," answered the spinster, without a  blush of shame. "I never was so nearly scared out of my senses in my life." Jerry thought so, but he only looked for an explanation. "( Just after you went," broke out Miss Palmy, "I was sitting here, sewing away on John Tyler's coat-the new brown one, you know. Well, I was making button-holes- and a mighty nice piece of business it is-so I was earnest about it, without looking up. I heard a noise, but I didn't   (CIESTNUT' WOO).        241 think much of it, and pretty soon I heard it again. I was just turning the last corner, and couldn't have taken off my eyes if the house had been on fire, so," and Palmy really shuddered and looked around over both shoulders, " so I felt something touch my face, and I jumped, oh! I jumped half way across the room, coat and all, for there stood "-another shudder--" the most awful-looking creature I ever saw. She held out to me a thing--I don't know what it was-it looked like an arm, but it was only so long," measuring with her fingers. "I dropped the coat, as if I had been shot, and then she set up such a laugh-oh! I can hear it now-it was awful, awful!" "Wasn't it something like a roar?" asked Jerry, coming close up to Palmy, and bending his face down. "Didn't it, now, sound like the lion?" "I don't know," answered Palmy, without seeming to take much notice of his observation. "While I stood there looking at her, and she at me, she kept holding out that thing, and saying:             - "'Och, and can't ye shake hands with a poor body, and say ye're glad to see me?' "I don't think I answered a word-my tongue felt as if it had lead put right on it; but this didn't trouble her, for she came-she actually did-close up to me, and tried to get hold of my hand. Oh, how I screamed, and I caught up the coat, and threw it right in her face, whereupon she only laughed louder than she had before, and mumbling something about 'quite a present,' she deliberately folded up that coat- that bran-new brown coat of John Tyler's-took out an old ragged handkerchief from her pocket, and tying it in it, put it under her arm. All this time I couldn't say a word-no, not even if she had tied me up and carried me off, I was so terribly frightened; and then, sitting down in my rocking- VOL.

Suddenly, I found my tongue, and I gave it to her, but there she sat, rocking away, as if this was her house, and not mine, and not a word did she answer lme; she only said: "' Give me some dinner, I am hungry.' "Give me my coat, and be off!' I screamed, thinking she might be deaf, and not have heard me before; but she did, the vixen, for she held it out to me in that hand, and said, 'Why don't you take it?' and when I tried to, she drew it away again, and laughed once more. I could bear any thing but that laugh." "'I am not going,' she said, 'until I have something to eat, so, as there are no men folks to come,'-how she knew that I can't tell-' I will just sit still until you are ready to give it to me. Och! and indaad you wouldn't begrudge a poor crittur a bit to eat, would you? Indaad and indaad you wouldn't.' I could have beaten her, but it wouldn't have done any good," said Palmy, despondingly. "She would have been sitting there now, if I hadn't, and she ate just like a horse. She kept saying, ' more-more--more'- and I doubt whether there is a mouthful left for our supper. When she came to the last piece of bread, then asked for more, and I told her, up and down, she couldn't have it-she caught up the goose-my hot goose "-(ah! Palmy, that was the unkindest cut of alD-" and held it so near me that I do verily believe it scorched every hair off my head."  Jerry looked. Every gray hair lay just where it had lain ever since he had known her; he felt quite relieved. "Then, after she seemed satisfied, she got up, made an aw- ful face, and a courtesy, and saying,' Thank ye much and kindly for my dinner, and this handsome coat; you're very good-- very good, indaad,' she went away. What with the goose   CHESTNUT WroOD.        r3 and the coat, I couldn't move for some time, and when I did, I tied up the gate, locked the door, put the table and two chairs against it, and sat down to plan what I should do if she should come back." "-And what did you mean to do?" asked Jerry, with much curiosity. Palmy pointed to the stove; upon it was the tin boiler she used to boil her weekly washing in, filled to the brim with water, boiling and bubbling away, as he had never seen it before. "Well, what?-wash her?" he naturally asked. Palmy's little pug almost disappeared from sight. "No-scald her!" she said, very emphatically. "Take every bit of skin off her body!" "O Oh, no-that 'ere would be terrible cruel; you wouldn't do it, now-would you, Miss Palmy?" "Let her come and see-only let her try it," answered Miss Palmy, in a threatening tone. "Here is the dipper, all ready. I would have let her have it till there wasn't a single drop left." "That is, if she would have stood stock still and taken it, which, as it would have been kind of hot, perhaps she wouldn't like to do; but then there is no telling; it would have burnt the lion's hide, anyhow, and terrible glad on' I should be, for one."n It was late that night before the light went out in Palmy Fitch's little cottage. Between the strangeness of the visi- tor and the loss of the coat, and the surmises which Jerry and Mr. Atherton entertained as to the object of the old woman's visit to Chestnut Wood, there was so much that was strange that sleep seemed to have forsaken the quiet roof. Palmy felt a moral certainty that the old woman would return to get her lodging out of her as she had her dinner, and when she thought of her taunt, that there were no men folks to come home, she almost hoped she might, that she might show to her the stalwart form and handsome  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7088-00000128"/> 244         z lE TN U T WOOD.  face of her protector. Poor Palmy!-she had a woman's  heart, after all, and knew what it was to lean upon and be proud of the arm that protected her. One more home that night was destined to be disturbed by this unexpected visitor, and for this one we shall surely feel more sympathy than for all the others. Since Sybil's disappearance, old Dinah had seemed to every one who came to see her to be fast failing, both in health and spirits. She no longer welcomed her visitor with that bright smile which so lighted up her dark face, but with a startled look, said, "Oh, I thought it was she. Where is she?- has she forgotten old Dinah?" Aunt Mary was frequently with her; indeed her favor- ite resort was to the cottage of the old woman, for there she found what she so much loved-true, simple, unaffected piety. She not only gave comfort, but she derived much;  and many an hour might she be seen with old Pomp's Bible in her hand, reading those precious words, made doubly dear to the fading earthly vision of Dinah, by the promise of re- union and rest in that " glorious other world." It was sin- gular that upon the subject of religion Dinah's mind was clear and active as ever. Her love for her " dear Saviour- for the sparkling crown and the golden harp "-the pictures of gorgeous beauty in which that New Jerusalem constantly presented itself, while they showed all the fervid imaginationl peculiar to her race, showed also that though God may have hidden these things " from the wise and prudent," lhe often- times " reveals them unto babes." Aunt Mary had not bcee  to the cottage this afternoon. Dinah had missed her, or rather had missed the rich treat of a long reading, and was trying to compensate for it as best she could, when a step near the house caused her to shut the Bible. She thought Aunt Mary had come at last, but the smile upon her face   CHESTNUT WOOD..        24 died away as it fell upon the comer, who, in her turn, was not a little astonished at the sight of the old negro woman. For a moment they looked at each other in silence, and then Dinah, opening her Bible, began to repeat a verse in a slow solemn tone. "Oh, daft, is she?" said Moll, looking at her with an expression of scorn. "Well, it's just as well-I can sleep here to-night without being disturbed." Walking deliber- ately in, taking no further notice of her hostess, she took off her bonnet and shawl, rolled the coat tightly up in the latter, and sat down. After a few minutes, yawning and stretching herself, as if she felt fatigued, she commenced a careful survey of the apartment. She opened every drawer, looked into the little closet, but, as if feeling a sovereign contempt for what she saw, only said, "Pshaw! what trash!" and shut them, without touching their contents. Dinah fol- lowed her with a lack-lustre eye, and without the slightest effort to stop her. At last, Moll saw Pomp's pipe on the little shelf in the fire-place. "Any 'bacca?" she asked, for the first time speaking to Dinah. Dinah shook ler head. "I tell you, old nigger!" shouted Moll, in a loud tone, "you have got 'bacca, and you had better hand it out." Dinah made an eager motion towards the pipe, but Moll moved it out of her reach by putting it in her mouth. She saw at once, froi the condition of the pipe, that it must have been some time since it was used, and so, half-believing Dinah, or at least having sense enough to see that in her present condition she could get no tobacco from her, she put her hand dlown to the bottom of her own pocket, and drew out a piece, which, stufiS;g in, she lighted, and began delib- erately to smoke. Once more the funies fronm tlje old pipe circled up around the negro cottage-once mlore the delicate  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7088-00000129"/> 246        CHESTNUT WOOD. wreaths of smoke played before old Dinah's eyes, as they had done in days of yore, and kindly now, as then, fell they upon her fading senses, for she forgot her unwelcome visitor, and was back among those years long past, and now but sel- dom forgotten. Poor old Dinah!-she was cared for even then. Pipe after pipe was filled and wasted, and still sat that silent woman, like a foul phantom, by Dinah's hearth-stone. Daylight faded away. Darkness crept silently in through the small windows, and settled down on the room, on Dinah and on IMoll. Nothing disturbed it. The low breathing of the old negro's evening prayer was the only sound; no one stirred. By and by, Dinah was startled by a sudden loud noise. She had no thought as to what it might be-no wish to penetrate the darkness and discover; she was motionless, as if turned into bronze. Then there followed loud and measured breathing; it was from the spot where the strange figure had sat, and very slowly cane the. idea into Dinah's mind, that whoever or whatever it was, it had fallen asleep. Still she felt no inclination to stir. There she sat until the morning again dawned, and by its gray light she saw the woman upon the floor. What a spectacle she presented as she lay there, extended at full length-her dishevelled hair around her pinched and sharpened face in thick masses-her arms spread at full length, and her soiled and ragged clothes scarcely protecting the body they covered. She still slept soundly; she was exhausted bhher long walk, and to this Dinah probably owed it that she had escaped with so little molestation. Now, as she saw the deformed and hideous creature stretched out upon her floor, she began to tremble violently, and to wish for Jerry or Nep, or any living thing that could break the spell by which she seemed surrounded. Once she thought of stealing from the house while she slept, and going even to the workhouse for safety, but she could    CHESTNUT WOOD.         247 not take home with her, and she certainly could not leave it there, so she sat on, nor ever moved her eyes from the living thing before her. Moll was not accustomed to late sleeping, atnd the sun had risen before she, with some dreadful oaths 'at the hardness of her bed, and the soreness of her limbs, lifted herself with difficulty, and being once more fairly upon her feet, demanded her breakfast of Dinah. Dinah pointed to the closet-door. "Well! up with you, you old black toad, you, and get it for me. Don't you know enough to wait upon your betters?" Dinah did not stir, but looked in so vacant a manner at her, that Moll's conclusion of the night before that she must be either mad or an idiot, was confirmed. "Can't you stir?" she said, lifting old Pomp's cane, which still stood in the corner as he used to keep it, in a threatening manner. "Up wid ye, or-"   Dinah saw it descending upon her-but if the blow had killed her, she  :l could not have moved. Moll's intention, however, was to alarm her, and the cane only touched the border of the snow-white cap, but it fell upon Dinah's heart, and she never recovered the stroke. Her under-jaw dropped-her eyes distended-and with a heavy groan she fell forward from her chair upon the floor. Moll stood a moment by her side with the cane still lifted over her, but when she saw she did not stir, or give any signs of life, kicking the prostrate body with her foot, she said: * -.  . "And it's dead you are, is it-you black thing, you? Well, the sooner the better, seeing as how I didn't touch you; and now if there is any thing worth the having, I'll jist take it along with me-nobody will be the wiser, for nobody knows that ould Moll is here." She laughed a diabolical laugh-one precisely like that which so alarmed the lone Palmy Fitch. Shame on you, Moll: of all the shameful acts  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7088-00000130"/> 248        CHESTNUT WOOD. of a shameless life, never one which shall tell more against you in that dread day of account than that poor fallen, but God-loved negro woman! There was nothing of any value to be found; and in the alarm which Dinah's still body w-as beginning, in spite of her indifference, to force upon her, she made all haste to leave the cottage, forgetting, in her hurry, the new coat which she left as a elmeento against her. She had no intention of returning to London without seeing Mr. Atherton. She knew all the risks which she ran when she undertook the business; but she was urged by two motives, the strongest of which a wicked nature like hers is capable-the love of money and revenge. The money-the large reward promised; and the revenge-"Bites as well as barks;" she had repeated it to herself a hundred times on her way down. It had fed her when hungry-rested her when weary-been the sweetest of draughts when her lips were parched, and she could not stay to cool them in the flowing waters-could not; no,l Nature's pure gifts were not for such as her: they were spread all around her-but the chains that bound her from them were stronger than the fabled ones that were once wound around the struggling Tantalus, For a time she wandered in the woods. She knew it was very early, and so it would be of no use to go to Mr. Ather- ton; but she went as far from Dinah's house as she could, and picking up some dried acorns from under the trees, she munched them greedily like a famished animal. The first thing Mr. Atherton saw when he went into his  library in the morning, was the figure of Moll, standing stiff '  and still as he had seen it the previous day against the windoiw.  The moment she saw that she was recognized, she began the same motions that she had made before,'only more rapid, and apparently more in earnest; but this time Mr. Atherton   CIIESTNUT WOOD.        249 went immediately to the window, and raising it bade her enter. Moll's errand made her bold, and without waiting for a second invitation, she stepped at once into the room. "Your business, woman?" was his first salutation. i' Och! and indade," she began to whine. "Stop that, and come at once to the point," interrupted Mr. Atherton. This was new treatment to Moll, and she could not adjust herself to it easily. She began in the same tone three times, and each time was immediately brought to a stop. Mr. Atherton seemed to know by intuition with whom he had to deal. ' If you have nothing to do but whine, go as you came," he pointed to the window; "if you have, speak quickly--my patience is not of long dura- tion." Moll looked in his face-it was stern and passionless- and she began almost to fear that' the news she brought would not be of consequence enough to him to procure the reward. She looked to the window, half meditating an es- cape and return, without divulging the secret. This Mr. Atherton noticed, and to put an end to any further doubt, he said: "You come from New-York, and bring me news of my granddaughter. If it prove true, you shall not lose your re- ward. Speak freely-no one shall harm you.) "I do. You are a wise man," and now Moll spoke another language, " but I betray only for reward. What security have I, if I tell you where she is, that I shall re- ceive the money-the thousand dollars?" "The security of my word. I give no other." "But they would kill me if they knew it. Who shall protect me from them?" "Look here, woman!" said Mr. Atherton, starting sud- denly upon his feet with an energy which frightened Moll, VOL. i.-1 1   &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7088-00000131"/> 250        CIESTNUT WOOD. "I have borne just as much of this as I shall. Take your choice! Tell me at once what you know, or I will arrest you-confine you-and you shall tell, before a court of jus. tice, without the reward." Moll visibly trembled. She had thought the game pretty much in her own hands. She was alarmed to find she had at last met with a master. "Well, don't frighten a poor creature," she said, with a slight touch of the original whine. "You shall know,-only it was natural I should like to make sure of my pay." "You shall have it-go on." Moll had intended to contne her story simply to where Sybil now was-and so she did; nor could any threats or  promises prevail upon her to betray either the person by whom, or the object for which, Sybil had been stolen. The street and number of the house, even the very room, and the stairs leading to it, in which the child was confined, she gave with perfect accuracy and clearness; then said her task was over, and she would wait for " the reward, un- til they had Sybil safely in their possession." She appointed the place and time of meeting when she should receive it, and ended by simply assuring Mr. Ather- ton that she trusted his honor as a gentleman not to betray her either to the police or her own associates. "Make yourself easy," was the only answer she obtained; ( if you have not deceived us, you are safe; if you have, on your own head be it."  Mr. Atherton, Jerry, and Nep, were soon once more on their way to the city. Jerry was full of fears; he was sure no truth ever came out of the "roaring lion" yet, and Palmy Fitch's recital, and his own night's reflection, had only served to convince him that such a piece of flesh and blood could belong to no mortal. Mr. Atherton, on the contrary, felt quite sure of finding Sybil. His long city life had taught him that nothing is   CHESTNUT WOOD.         251 more rare than L honor among thieves," and that for so large a reward one should turn traitor, was neither new nor strange. Yet, so had he struggled against all hope of ever again see- ing the child, so dead and cold had he made his heart, that the warmth of returning life crept into it but slowly, very slowly. He was annoyed, and often frettsd, by Jerry's lo- quaciously expressed hopes and fears. His answers to them were brief, and far from hearty. All this Jerry saw; andi well as he thought he knew Mr. Atherton, his behavior now was to him a matter of much useless conjecture as they drove along. A search-warrant was quickly procured after reaching the city, and police officers, accompanied by Jerry and Nep, were soon on their way to Sybil's late home, if home such a place could be called. Moll had made no mention of the kitchen. There she had hoped Nancy would be; and hear- ing the officers enter the front door, would be able easily to make her escape-nor was she wrong. Nancy was there; and the authoritative manner in which the door was opened, without ringing or asking any leave, revealed to her the character of the comers. Hastily catching a small iron- bound box in her hand, she put on her bonnet, and the kitchen was empty long before the officers had satisfied them- selves that Sybil was not concealed in some of the upper rooms of the house. In the chamber where she had been kept, still remained the little books and toys which Nancy had brought to amus. her, and the sun-bonnet, which she had worn when out, hung carefully on a nail at the head of the bed. These were all precious relics to the girl; and they were not molested. They formed in themselves con- clusive evidence that a child had been there, and so far cor- roborated the old woman's testimony; but where was she now? It seemed impossible that the intended search could have been known to the inhabitants of the house, and the ,*  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7088-00000132"/> 252        CHESTNUT WOOD. child hastily removed; for not a moment had been lost, after the application was made, before the requisite authorities were on their way to the house. The officers looked very much annoyed. It was not often they were so easily foiled. Jerry was indignant beyond the power of even his vocabu- lary to express; and Nep stood wagging his tail, and snuf- fing around the bed and books in a manner as expressive of disappointment as any of the others. When they came to the kitchen, the marks of recent flight were more visible. The door had been left ajar, and a woman's shawl lay on the floor near it, as if it had slipped off as the wearer was pass- ing quickly out. Here, a very thorough search was made; all Moll's old bundles of rags and filth were drawn from their hiding-places, and unceremoniously emptied upon the floor. Nothing was found to add any farther proof to their suspicions, when Nep was heard to growl over some bricks in the hearth, and to commence tearing them up with his fore-paws with a great deal of quickness and celerity. All eyes were directed to him, but Jerry said, "Let him alone i He's cute; he knows more than the rest on us all put to- gether, now" The men laughed, but showed no inclillnation to disturb him. The bricks were too heavy for him to re- move far out of their places, but he contrived to push one so that he could pull up, with a delighted growl, a piece of blue calico.  "Sybil's gown, I say for't!" exclaimed Jerry, no longer waiting the movements of the dog, but giving him a push aside, and tearing up the bricks in an instant. There, to be sure, was Sybil's dress and apron, carefully folded and laid away in a small hole, which seemed made with care, under the bricks in the hearth. "This," said one of the police officers, stooping and ex- amiring the place carefully, " was made for something be- sides hiding children's clothes. Folks don't take so much   CHESTNUT WOOD.         253 pains for nothing. We have had our eyes on this house for some time-but not for a stolen girl. It's the last thing I should have thought of. They are a cunning set, these rogues, and you may nab them if you can. They are always just gone-as they are now; but come, up with the rest of the hearth-there is room here for more holes than one, and more hidden things than girls' frocks." In a few moments the bricks were all up; nothing appeared but this one place, -still this was sufficient to set their suspicions on the alert, and every plank and broken bit of wall was sounded and shaken in a way which showed the men were familiar with their business. Jerry took up the little clothes, and shaking them care- fully out, held them before him, and talked to them almost as he would have to the child herself. He felt a great in- clination to kiss them-but he glanced at his companions, and wisely forbore. Here, then, was indubitable proof that Sybil had been there; that she had been stolen, and kept carefully secreted. But again the question returned-where is she now? Jerry felt a cold shudder creep over him, for suddenly it had oc- curred to him that she might have been murdered. Her absence from the house; the careful manner in which the clothes were secreted; and the guilty appearance of the room, all confirmed the fear as soon as it suggested itself. With pale and trembling lips he asked the question of one of the officers. "Not unlikely," was his answer. "Examine the clothes, and see if there is any blood upon them." They dropped from Jerry's hand, as if a spirit had grasped them, and he gasped-out: "You-you look-I can't." The clothes were carefully looked over, but, excepting that they were more soiled, they looked no differently from   &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7088-00000133"/> 254        CHESTNUT WOOD. what they did when Sybil took them off. They were cer- tainly free from any marks of violence. Somewhat relieved, Jerry again folded them up, but he felt excited, and certainly very unlike himself. He was in haste to go back to Mr. Atherton. The air of the room grew so oppressive that he could scarcely breathe. Poor Jerry!- he was never so overcome before. How precious those little relics of the child grew to him, as he carried them; he would not have parted with them for the most saintly garments that ever were bequeathed by holy beings of old to worship. ping posterity, for Jerry had loved the child-loved her with all the strength of his great, rough, warm heart. To his sur- prise, he met Mr. Atherton not far from the house. He had remained away as long as he thought necessary for the securing of the child and the arrest of the thief, and then the suspense was no longer to be borne. He saw Jerry long before Jerry recognized him, and saw him alone. Stung almost to madness by the disappointment, he seized his arm, and with a grasp which made even those tough sinews ache, asked: "Where is-she?-answer quick." "Here are her clothes," said Jerry, holding out the dress. "But the child?" "Gone! ' Gone!" Mr. Atherton had not another question to ask. The life-blood flowed away from the heart, and it was cold and dead again. For several days a most active search was recommenced by the authorities, but of course with no more success. The child, they again felt assured, was not to be found within the city of New York, and this time they were right in their conclusion. Mr. Atherton and Jerry returned to Chestnut Wood.   CHESTNUT WOOD.        255 This war with Fate-woe to the mortal who undertakes it- for he can never come off conqueror! In some way, Moll became aware of the fact that Sybil was not to be found, and when Jerry went to the place appointed to meet her, she was not there. No search was made for her. A common belief in her faith all had. It was supposed that the child had been removed during her absence, and that she would be equally ignorant with themselves as to her present place of secretion. "If she finds out, she knows the way here, and will come for the money, no fear," said Jerry, and so, un- known almost to themselves, they rested their hopes for the future upon the old vagrant Moll. But Moll was by this time bitterly regretting the steps she had taken, and the assurance of the gift of the five thousand dollars would hardly have tempted her to do the same thing again. Back in New York, she found the whole world suddenly changed to her. She dared not put her foot in one of her former haunts. If the child had been found, she had intended to return and deny all knowledge of the matter, and this, she had no doubt, she should be able to make good. They were all accustomed to her absences; sometimes they had been made longer than was this, and only, so she returned with money, to show she had been employed in their common in- terests, no fault was found, or questions asked. Now, she should take money; they would presume it procured in the same way. She would for a time share with them in their concealments, and then, retaining a large share of the money, would have accomplished her two objects-revenge on all who had loved and protected the child, and a nice sum laid privately up for future use. How much pains she had taken to conceal her journey!- how her own knowledge of the country near New-York had enabled her to go straight on, without making a single in- quiry. How she had gone without food, and slept-when  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7088-00000134"/> CHESTNUT WOOD. sleep she did-under the fences, or in some solitary barn; and all for what?-to be discovered-to have the child re. moved-and to be herself shut out from every customary means of livelihood. She dared not even go for the old basket in the grocery cellar, and what mattered it, if shie could?-the seat under the tree was lost to her for ever! A very wretched being now was old Moll-not from regret or remorse-oh, no-there was not enough of good in her nature to be capable of either of these, but because she was foiled-because she had played for two prizes and lost them both. Success!-how often it is with us all, even the best of us, the touchstone upon which we try our actions.   CHAPTER XVI. WHEN the mind is troubled, the heart oppressed, and the hours go wearily on, as if Time were unwilling to bear away so sad a record, and paused in his flight to allow some brighter finger to trace the page, there is nothing which brings the relief equal to that found in doing good to others. Of all the better parts of our nature, whose indulgence is its own reward; this is the quickest and the surest, and-for the simple reason that we fo9rct ourselves. So was it with Aunt IMary. She had become so much attached to Sybil-so wrapt up ill the child's progress in mental and moral good-was so satisfied to have found an object to live and think for, that repaid her in kind for the affection bestowed-that she had been gradually withdrawing herself from all the minor interests which she had formerly taken in Mr. Rogers's "parish." In vain Mrs. Rogers sent her regular notices of the sew- ing society and female prayer-meetings. These were well enough when there was nothing else, but Aunt Mary, from her quiet and retiring habits of thought and feeling, had long considered herself a supernumerary in them, and been glad if an humble duty gave her a sufficient excuse for not at- tending. To the very sick she still remained the same "angel of comfort " that she had ever-been, but with this ex-  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7088-00000135"/> CHESTNUT WOOD. ception, she held very little intercourse with her former friends. "Heart full and hands full, I am at home, now, sister," she would say, in reply to Mrs. Rogers's animated expostu- lations. "These children are enough for a person not more competent than I am myself; youz are more than sufficient for all the wants of your people. Give the time to them that I save you in the education of Mattie." Mrs Rogers was always silenced, but she was one of those women who, though they have sense enough to stop talking, are very seldom really convinced of the right of any opinion but such as they themselves hold; so Aunt Mary, on nearly every visit to Hymcswold, had the same ground to go over, and always with equal success. But she was good-natured and patient, and adapted herself to the little foibles of her sex with most exemplary fortitude, and she was repaid in the love and confidence which she univer- sally received. At first the loss of Sybil fell upon her with a crushing power. When she found that she could not ac- celerate the search-that there was really nothing for her to do but wait'the event, whatever it might be-she asked for strength to bear the uncertainty, with- childlike confidence in Him who disposeth of all the events of life. She strove to make the affliction a matter of spiritual growth and dis- cipline; then to look about her for objects of interest and occupation. Mattie's lessons were steadily continued-Mr. Atherton wishing no change made in their arrangements un- til it was more sure that Sybil would never return; and, as I have said before, every day saw Aunt Mary a very wel- come visitor at old Dinah's cottage. After Mr. Atherton and Jerry had left for New-York, on the day of Moll's visit to Chestnut Wood, Aunt Mary, with her hand frequently upon her heart, as if external pressure could control internal emotions, went to pay her usual visit to the poor black   woman.  As she approached the cottage, she saw no smoke from its little chimney-a very unusual thing-for, at that hour in the morning, the usual house-cleaning was but just finished, and the fire had generally an important agency in the matter. Somewhat alarmed, Aunt Mary quickened her steps, and knocked a little louder than she was accustomed to upon the door. There was no answer, so, without waiting for a second attempt, she lifted the latche:d entered. There upon the floor lay Dinah, just as Moll had left her, but with returned consciousness. Her fall had been so vio- lent that she was unable to raise herself, but she was repeat- ing verses of the Bible in her same low, and, to Aunt Mary, remarkably sweet tone of voice. "But be not thou far from lme, O Lord! O my strength! haste thee to help me," she heard her say, as she closed the door. A joyful smile lit up the dark face, as her eyes fell upon Miss Rogers. It was not so much that help had come as that God had heard her poor sinful prayer, ':and, even when the words were upon her lips, had answered her request. Aunt Mary lifted her, without exclamation or question, from the floor, and having satisfied herself that she had really broken one of her limbs, helped her, sLe hardly knew how, to the bed, and laid her in it. During the time, though she must have suffered much severe' pain, Dinah ut- tered no word of complaint; not even a groan escaped her lips until she was fairly in bed, then, clasping her withered hands and looking up, she said: "God have mercy on poor old Dinah, and let her come up in the golden chariot." With what an experienced and gentle hand Aunt Mary ministered now to all her necessities! How carefully she adjusted the bed-how smoothly she spread the covering- how she soothed the aching limb, until pain, if not less vio-  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7088-00000136"/> t60         CHESTNUT WOOD. lent, was more easily borne, and then how refreshing the cup of hot tea and slice of buttered'toast, which she held while Dinah ate. From Dinah's imperfect narrative, she found it impos- sible to come to any clear idea of what had taken place. She had no doubt that some one had been in the cottage and had alarmed her, lbt whom, or for what object, she could by no means satisfy hersclf. The new brown coat, left upon the floor by Moll, afforded no clue; it only suggested that the visitor must have been a man. How to summon a doctor was now a great source of trouble to Aunt Mary.  She did not like to leave Dinah, suffering as she then was, to go back to Chestnut Wood, and the spot where the cottage stood was so lonely that no one ever passed it, and, at this season of the year, vis. itors were rare. She went down to the little lake manyl times, listened and looked in every direction, but no one was to be seen-only the branches of the old trees waved their long arms with that murmuring noise which makes the lone woods so eloquent.  No human sound was there.   How desolate it seemed to her; how gladly would she at that moment have exchanged it, with all its surpassing beauty, for the noise and bustle of any town, no matter how crowded, only so there was some one to speak to-some one who would bring help to poor old Dinah. At last it seemed evident to Aunt Mary that there was no help, that she herself must go to town, and while shee was trying to make Dinah understand why she must leave her, she heard a sound, as of a slow and cautious foot, Pp- proaching the house. She listened eagerly; it drew nearer- some one was certainly at last coming for her relief. S1he was hastening to open the door, when she saw a shadow before the window.  Slightly alarmed at the precautions which were taken, she drew back and stood out of sight, and   (rIESTNT17L WOOD.       261  then, after a moment, she saw a little black bonnet and a withered, ghastly face looking in through the panes. She evidently was not seen, for the figure came out more boldly, and standing now directly in fiont of the window, took a careful survey of as much of the room as the window exposed. Dinah saw it, and with a shriek, such as the pain h]ad not wrung from her, she said,  "God have mercy on poor old Dinah!   Aunt Iary made a step hastily forward ; the person saw her, but she had also heard Dinah's scream, and knew that she must still bo living, so, emboldened by the fact, with no intention of being frightened away by only one woman, she came in and shut the door behind her. The terror of Dinah was piteous to behold, but she had now a protector, and so both she and the intruder soon found. Aunt Mary recognized the woman as the same one who had come on the previous day to Chestnut Wood, and though prepared for her personal appearance, was not a little aston- ishcd at the effrontery with which she had entered and seated herself upon Pomp's favorite chair. At first, she did not address her; but in a whisper told Dinah not to fear, for she would see that no harm befell her. But she might have spared her efforts; for the image upon which, through the whole night Dinah's strained and painful vision had rested, she cou'd not think of when absent without trembling; and when present, it filled her with terror perfectly beyond her control. To remove the woman as quickly as possible was Aunt Mary's only resort; so turning to her, she said, in her Lind manner, "Do you want any thing here that I can do for you?" "Yes," answered Moll, readily; for the kind voice was the first one she had heard for years, and it disarmed her of her usual insolence. "Yes. I want my breakfast, and a coat I left here."  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7088-00000137"/> 2.692      ,5 C'H ESTNUT WOOD. "rYo, left the coat? then perhaps you can tell me how this accident came to happen to old Dinah." "Perhaps I can, and perhaps I can't; or shan't, pretty much the same thing, I imagine." "But you mzust, or you shall have neither your breal- fast nor the coat."' I Might makes right; if we were to try for the strongcsl, I would take my breakfast and the coat too." "(You will do no such thing.   I will give you your breakfast, and the coat, when you tell me how you came by it-but you must first go on an errand for me. This, I am sure," said Aunt Mary, speaking very kindly again, :' you will not refuse me. Dinah has broken her limb, anad is in great suffering. I want you to go to Chestnut Wood, and tell some one there to- send to Hymeswold for a phy- sician., Old Moll fixed her keen eyes upon Aunt Mary, as if she would read her soul. Had she seen there one fear, one fail tering of purpose, she would have uttered her derisive laugh, taken her breakfast and coat, and gone  But she found a force she had never to combat with before-the strength of moral courage: and the old wicked creature yielded to it as never in her whole life had she yielded to personal violence. u Give me breakfast," she said, " and when I go through Hymeswold, I will tell some one to send your doctor here.' "And the coat?" "Oh, the coat I must have, of course. What use could you make of it?" "Retturn it to its rightful owner." "And who is that?" "You must tell me-I don't know.'5 Moll laughed.

Aunt Mary had recognized Miss Palmy Fitch, and was glad to be able to restore what, if lost, would have been a source of much annoyance to her; so she spared no time in preparing something for Moll to eat,--and then, to her in- expressible surprise, saw th1e old creature go quietly away. There even seemed to be a tone of regret in the words which she addressed to Dinah as she passed her bed. "Old nigger! I didn't mean to scare you so.   You've no more pluck than a goose." For once, Moll kept her word: and Aunt  Iary had, in a much shorter time than she had anticipated, the pleasure of seeing the physician enter, and the knowledge that the fracture was by no means as serious as she had feared; so hlaving made arrangements with him to send immediately on his return a good nurse from flymeswold to the cottage, she began to feel inpatient to go home, hoping to receive news from her dear, lost Sybil.  IIow grateful and happy she would have felt if she could have seen Sybil now ! Sybil's sickness, on  her arrival at 3ir. Wallace's, had been occasioned more by her long-continued excitement than by di-sease. Her brain and nervous system had been taxed to the utmost; and when relief came-when she   found she was once more safe--all restraint over herself gave way, and she  lay insensible in the arms of "good  Mamma Wallace." A few- days sufficed to bring rest and quiet, both to body and mind; but she was still weak-still unable to give ally connected account of what had taken place; and very obstinately did 3Irs. Wallace persist in believing that she was the victim of a cruel grandfather's ill usage. Sybil was just beginning to sit up in her bed and amuse   &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7088-00000138"/> 264             WOFOEDSnTUT V( woo., herself with the boys, who still remained at home, and whose sole business seemed to be, to minister to her happiness and amusement, when one morning she was interrupted in her diversions by a loud knock upon the kitchen door. Whlat was her delight on hearing, as it opened, Jerry's well-klnown voice. She tried to move from her bed, and run in to see hm; but she was, far too weak, and to her repeated calls there was no answer returned. aWonudering that le was not sent in to see her, she lay listening to every sound, expect. ing each moment that he would enter her room. Suddenly against her door she heard two large paws thrust, and a low growl followed. "Nep-Nep!" she called. The dog heard, and answer. ed by one of those joyous barks with which he was accus- toimed to hail the return or those he loved. Jerry, who was busily engaged in telling 3Irs. Wallace about Sybil's disap- pearance, heard it quickly, and looking at her, said: "Charles ain't at home, is he?  "No," answered the good lady, somewhat confused. "What a terrible growling that dog of yours makes. I wish you would turn it out." "He smells something--he never makes that noise for nothing. Let him  alone; he won't do any harm  unless there's mischief aboardc-and then he'll put into it, for lihe has got his appetite terribly whetted up by prowling about there in the city so long for nothing. His teeth are sharp- set now. Hear the feller. He is talking as well as if he had a mouth to speak words with. I must see what's to "No-you are not going there until you have done your story-I want to hear about Sybil. You are just on -your way back from New-York, now, are you?" "Yes, sartain-and it's the third time I have been on a fool's errand--but I can't stand that bark, any how, Mrs.   WNVallace, so, witul your leave, I will just look in upon him." ,Jerry opened the kitchen door, and Nep bounded back to  ni, calling him with his short, quick barks, anld running bctiveen lint anld the door where Sybil was. To step for- -ird andi opea the door w17,as but the work of an instant, and Sybil, with a cry of joy, found herself in Jerry's arms. Nep too, would not be forgotten; he kept thrusting his cold nose between Jerry's great hands until he had attracted atcntiol cd cairle in for his share of caresses. Mrs. Wallace had followed, and when Jerry looked up, "was sLandlin looking at flnom with an expression most ludicrously composed of joy nd sorrowl. But the meeting in itself was a refutation of all her fears, and when she spoke it was to say: ' Well, I suppose it is best that you have found her, since you seemn so glad of it; but if I had had my own way, you would not have done it until I was a great deal surer of that grandfather than I am now." i r. tlelrtou, is it, you are talking about?" asked J0c', his joy forgotten in his surprise. "Why, there ain't "another such a man in all this world. He sre aof lzain.

It was long before she could make Jerry see this;   &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7088-00000139"/> 266         CHESTNUT WOOD. and when at last lie did, he stopped so suddenly and broke out with, "Now I say for't, the child hain't no more strength now than a lamb an hour old. Why, how she looks! jist," con. tinued Jerry, holding her out at arm's length, and carefully surveying her, " jist like a little blue violet when the sun has scorched it all up, and the poor thing is hanging its head down ready to die. Poor child-poor child! what she must have suffered! It will c'ny jist break her grandfather's heart.' Mrs. Wallace looked very incredulous, but wisely did not express her feelings-she only said: "I suppose, then, he must be told the child is here." "Yes, of course; why not? You don't mean to steal her nzow, do you, Mrs. Wallace?" "I should be glad to, if I could. She seems to belong to me, rather than to him." "I am afeard you would find a job of it to convince him; better not try it." "I have no idea of it; but the child is all tired out so soon-and if you ever get her home, you must go away now, *and leave her to rest." Jerry very reluctantly complied: but neither threaten- ing nor coaxing could induce Nep to move from the bed,- sitting down by it, he fixed his eyes upon Sybil with an ex- pression which said, as plainly as words could, "The others may go-I shall remain."  And Mrs. Wallace, touched by an affection so akin to her own feelings, showed no desire to remove him-only telling him, as if she were speaking to a child, "to keep still, and not make a noise wagging his great tail upon the floor." Nep obeyed,-and even Mrs. Wallace herself could not have been a more quiet and watchful nurse. Jerry's first impulse, after leaving the room, was to re-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         67 turn at once to Chestnut Wood; but this implied the neces- sity of parting so soon from Sybil, that Mrs. Wallace, for a time, quite stoutly combatted it. She told Jerry, in very glowing terms, of the state of the child's mind when she first canoe to them, and her conviction that any excitement would induce the same thing again ; but it was in vain. Jerry promised that all care should be used-but Mr. Atherton must know at once; and so leaving Nep as guardian against any farther accident, he was, with a fleet horse and a light heart, soon on his way to Chestnut Wood. The whole seemed a dream to him. He shook his great frame, and rubbed his eyes, to be sure he was awake. He recalled every look, every word of the child. He once drew up his reins to turn his horse and go back, and see if in very truth it was Sybil by whose bedside Nep was sitting; then laughed at his own indecision, and said aloud to himself, "Sartain! sartain! How stupid I be!" but whether he referred to his mental or physical state, may be doubted; for he seemed inclined to rub his eyes now, not with his hands, but with the sleeve of his coat; and sure it is, they were oftener dimmed with tears of joy now, than they had before been with those of sorrow, when search was so fruitless. As he passed by the handbills on the liberty-poles, and large elm- trees, and barn-doors, on his way home, he could never re- frain from getting out and giving them a good hearty pull. down; then, with a loud " hurrah!" no matter whether any one heard or not, scattering them to the wind. This delay he excused in two ways, " it was relieving people generally fromn anxiety," and " the horse must have time to rest to draw a long breath ;" never but once before had Jerry driven an animal so furiously, and then it was when in pursuit of the fading track of the carriage which had taken the child away. Jerry had a kind of natural religion about him, if we may call the spontaneous feeling of the heart, which re-  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7088-00000140"/> 268        C( ESTN'IT WOO1D.  cognizes the Giver in the gift, by such a holy namle; and when he was meditating in what form of speech he -.should announce his good news to Mr. Atherton, he could think of -nothing but repeating the verse from the Bible, "Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost." As he said this frequently over to himself, he hadl such ta conlsciotsness of the look with which Mr. Atherton would receive it, and the cold way in which lie would say,. "Speak sense, Jerry, if you mean to have me understand you ;' thai he labored very hard to compose some other sentence, which should be conmmensurate with the dignity of the announce- ment.  Poor Jerry! it was almost the first time in his life that le had put words before things; and how lie came to be in so mucl trouble now, he could not at all under- stand-but often in times of joyful excitement the mind rests so completely satisfied upon the cause, that, as if in very wantonness, it plays with its care-released faculties upon the quibble of a word, or the formation of a sentence. By the time he reached Chestnut Wood, Jerry was in se- rious trouble; but, no soonerm did the hall-door close upon himl, and Aunt Mary's pale, anxious face look at him over the banisters, than he forgot it all; acnd called out:  "I've found her! Miss Rogers; I've found her! Sybil is safe! in a voice which sounded and resounded through tall the still rooms of the anxious house. Mr. Atherton heard it, and was at his library door in an instant. IMatic heard it-and tossing away the study-books, gave a long scream of childish, heartfeltjoy. Mrs. Giles, hidden in the re- cesses of her housekeeper's room, dropped the spoon with whicell she was deeply engaged stirring some nice article of cool- ery, and forgetting the long, but clean apron, in which she never made her appearance in public, was among the first to stand by Jerry. Margy, after repeating the sentence to her- self a sufficient number of times to make sure of its meaning?   CHESTNUT WOOD          269 dropped upon her knees, and there was not a saint in the whole calendar to whom0 her thanks were not warmly prof- fered. The assurance that the child was safe, and now carefully writched, was repeated over and over again, before any one seemed to find time to listen to the details of her escape. Thelse, even imperfectly as Jerry was able to give them, so corroborated what they had surmised of the circumstance, attending her disappearance, that the only marvel which now remained was, why, with all their efforts, they had not discovered her in New-York? still, now, no one but Mr. Atherton thought much of these things. In what he heard. he found the realization of his worst fears : and even in the recovery of the lost darling, he could not forget from what she had been rescued, and to what danger she must be con- stantly exposed in her future life. He felt uneasy now, in having her a moment longer from1 under his own roof; and contrary to Jerry's earnest wish, he ordered the horses im- lmediately put to the large carriage,:-and Miss Rongers to be ready to accompany him, without anmy delay, to Charlton. When Miss Rogers was sought for, she was not to be found. Mattie said she " bad put on her hat, and walked out without saying where she was going; but she thought it must be to old Dinah's cottage." "Yes, sartaiin," said Jerry, who stood by unwillingly completing the last of the preparations. "She would no more forget old Dinah, than she would her prayers ; and la,! nIow, how the old critlur will ' bless the Lord,' when she lhars on't; it were : ext to going to heaven oneself, to hear how she will take on If you must go, sir, considering how h]ind of sick Sybil is, and how still like they want to keep hler; why, we had beteur drive around there and talke Miss Rogers up. It is almost night; but I know .the road if I couldn't see my hand afore me.  We shan't go to-night, shall we, sir?"  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7088-00000141"/> 270         CHESTNUT WOOD. Mr. Atherton, without troubling himself to malke an answer to the last inquiry, stepped into the carriage, and said, "Drive around by Dinah's, then; only remember, you neither have your wagon nor Dobbin."  "Yes, sir,' said Jerry, in the abrupt tone with which lhe usually contented himself by showing his displeasure; anld the horses trotted off with that slow, stately motion so coln genial to their appreciation of-their own position in society. It was quite fast enough to please Jerry, for he had alnost a dread of the spirited troubled face of Mrs. Wallace, whichi he knew would greet thenl on their arrival at Charlton. They would not-reach there until midnight, and to disturb the family at such an hour  For once Jerry showed tile most discretion and good sense, but he was not urged on by the same fears as Mr. Atherton, and could better aflbrd to reason. Mattie was right. Aunt Mary had hastened with the joyful tidings to old Dinah, and had not the loud rattling of the carriage wheels given notice of its approach, some time before it stopped at the cottage, Jerry would have been right too, in his anticipations of the negro's occupation. taised upon her pillow in her bed, with folded hands andl uplifted eyes, she did little but utter pious ejaculations of thankfulness, and long after the noise of the wheels, as tlhey bore Miss logers away, had ceased, from the negro hut went up the same strains of grateful joy, "Bless the Lord, O! my soul." Miss Rogers had no time or wish to question the prio- priety of the sudden call to meet Sybil. She had only one thouglt, one wish-again to see her-to be sure that tlhe lost was found. The ride was long and silent. Mr. Ather- ton seemed hardly to notice the lquiet manner in which Jerry was driving the horses, and all were too busy thinking 'to allow much conversation.   CHESTNUT WOOD.         271 Occasionally Jerry broke in with some odd remark, or pointed out some spot on the road associated with an inci- dent in the search. As they passed the farm-house contain- ing the eight daughters, he repeated the cohversation he had had with their father, and, as if in much consternation, for the first time applied the whip to the horses, and drove quickly by; but Jerry's love of fun interfered with his other plans, for the spirit of the horses, once wakened by the sound of the lash, it was no easy matter to control them, and they flew over the road in a manner much more congenial to Mr. Atherton's and Aunt Mary's inclination; so it was not eleven o'clock when the little church spire of Charlton was seen leaning against the star-lit sky. "There-it is! said Jerry, stretching his head up, as if he expected to see Sybil, as well as the tower. "Now, we shall be there in a few minutes, and if you think best, Mr. Atherton, I will drive right to the tavern; it's only a few steps from there to Mr. Wallace's, and if Sybil was asleep, we might make such a noise, horses and all, that we should wake her up, and a terrible shame that would be, weak and pale as she is., "Very well, only make haste, Jerry. We can easily step over there, I suppose, Miss Rogers?" said Mr. Atherton. "Certainly, sir, or perhaps, now we are here, as the child has been so sick, it would be better, on her account, that we should not go before morning." "You can suit yourself; Imust see Sybil to-night." Aunt Mary's heart plead too,- she wished so much to be with the darling child; but she was unselfish, and the good of others always was placed before her own. It now, how- ever, was quite a question whether, if Mr. Atherton insisted on going, she had n better 5e with him. She thought she could quiet and C rse the child, and soothe her more quickly  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7088-00000142"/> 272         CHESTNUT 'VOOD. to sleep, than any one else. While she was doubting, Jerry settled the matter for her. "I thitnk, Miss Rogers,'" he said, "if Mr. Atherton is goingl to Mrs. WAallace's, to-nighlt, yon had better be alon , too; you can sort of keep her still, saying tihemu 'ere little ihy1nns to her that you know so many on; thl:em site Iused t love to sig when she was sick at home, when yoi first caint to Chestnut Wood, you know.  She is almost as pale alln bad looking now as she was 'then; she looks as if she Lad been frightened and scared until there warn't nothing left of her." The appearance of so stylish an equipage at such an hour of night, caused no little sensation in the village tavern. At first the landlord put his head out of the chamber win- dow, and in , very sleepy voice, demanlded, Whlo is there?: then, as he caught sight of the carriage, his voice immeldiately changed, and with a "I'll be down in a moniment," the hcaii disappeared. Then came one with a night-cap in its place, but that was quickly withdrawn, and in'an incredibly short space of time, the bolt was heard moving with that l'oud creaking sound so peculiar to country inns, and the party alighted. Mr. 'Atherton ordered supper and rooms prepared for them; they should be back in about an hour, and Jerry gavCe most particular I and exemplary directions about his horses. A few words sufficed to show the landlord that their first nap was likely to be their last one, for that night, at least; so, leading thie horses slowly away towards the stable, he thought over the best way of announcing the fact to his sleepy and not too thrifty partner, but he forgot that, though indolent, she was far from wanting in the good fe- male trait of curiosity; so he was quite surprised when, on returning to the house, he found her dressed, and walking up and down the little piazza in front of the house, in visible    CHESTNUT WOOD.         273 impatience to know what had become of their guests. Iad he taken all down to the stable? Perhaps she would have been better pleased if he had, for the idea of the supper at that time of night was not, at least, pleasant to her, and for a while she protested that ; she didn't care how smart the folks were, nothing should tempt her to make such a slave of herself. The rooms were ready, and if they choose to occupy them, they were welcome, but nothing more-noth- ing at all." The landlord went quietly on and kindled the fire in the kitchen, without taking any notice of his wife's grumbling. he had seen times before, in his married life, when his choice had been to cook the meal himself, or lose the sound of the rattling of silver in his rather empty tiller, so he went to work with the system of a man whose plans are not turned all adrift by a new occupation, lie put on the tea-kettle, and lighting tihe tin lantern, with- out proceeding to examine the state of the larder, went into the hen-coop, and soon returned, bringing in his hand two finc fat specimens of country poultry. The limbs were yet quivering with life when he began to dress them, for the table, and all this so quietly and good-naturedly that, in spite of her resolutions, the wife, almost without knowing it, busied herself in other little necessary preparations, so, before the strangers had reached Mr. Wallace's house, their supper was already under way. Jerry had a great many fears as to the reception they should meet. He knew Mr. Atherton was no favorite of Mrs. IW allace's, and certainly he was not a man to conciliate any one. Then the matter of quietly keeping Sybil, without sending word to Chestnut Wood-how could that be satis- factorily explained, without making bad worse?  Jerry knocked his hat very fast from one side of his head to the other, as they came in sight of thre house. He had an un- comfortable feeling that in some way he hlad betrayed trust, VOL. T.-1 2  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7088-00000143"/> 274        CHESTNUT WOOD. and should have prevented Sybil's being disturbed at such an unusual hour of the night. He was therefore much re. lieved when he saw a light burning brightly through one of the chamber windows-so one at least was not asleep in the house. Instead ofgoing to the door, he went under the win- dow, and called in a loud whisper: "I say!-I say, you!-open your window." The light was moved, as if the person had heard a noise; and had opened the door to see from whence it had come. Jerry waited until it was back in its former place, then called again': You!-you!-Mister!-won't you be good enough to open your window?" He saw a shadow upon the wall, and in a moment the window was softly raised. "A gal, I, know," whispered Jerry; "see how easy sle does it-that's right; halloo there " he said, still whispering ; " how's Sybil, to- night?" The head was now put entirely out of the window, and the voice asked: W Vho are you?' "Oh, we're friends, I guess; who are you?" ' Jerry?" asked the Aame voice again. "Yes, and Mr. Atherton and Miss Rogers. How is Sybil, I say?" "Better. Wait a mlinute and I will be there T" A tall, slight figure soon cautiously opened the door; no one recognized it, until Charles Wallace, speaking still in a whisper, said: Walk in gently, if you please. Sybil sleeps lightly, and was very tired when she went to sleep. I will speak to mother." Nep now began to bark loudly from Sybil's room; be- fore Charles could call his mother, she 'came from there   CHESTNUT WOOD.         275 to see what the matter was, and, as she opened the door, and saw so many in the entry, she had but one thought, and that was, that the same persons who had first carried Sybil away had traced her to their house, and were now come to take her by force. She opened the door wide and called Nep, who stood with ears pricked up, and dilated nostrils, waiting to spring upon any intruder. At one bound he was in the entry, but her astonishment was only increased by seeing him jump upon his master with the quick bark of Joy. Charles was in an instant by her side, and told her who her visitors were. He also had time to whisper, "Be kind, for my sake." Mrs. Wallace's ready wit soon put her in possession of the whole story, without asking a word, nor were her quick feelings untouched by the affection it evinced, so, nmuch to Jerry's relief, she closed Sybil's door, and then advanced with native dignity to welcome her unexpected visitors. Mr. Atherton only said, as he took her hand, "Twice you have saved her; I shall not forget." Aunt Mary began to make apologies for their intrusion at such an hour, but the honest "I do not wonder-I should have done the same," put her quickly at rest. And now the softly closed door is again as softly opened; a little slight figure, so white and fairy-like that it might easily be mis- taken for some child angel, stands there for one instant-but only one-for, with a scream of joy, "Grandpapa, my own grandpapa," Sybil throws herself into her grandfather's arms. Once more her heart beats tremblingly against his own- once more the child's soft breath plays upon his care-worn cheek-once more loving arms are wound around his neck, and gentle tones whisper of affection. Brave man!-thou hast withstood and conquered Fate, and this is thy reward;  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7088-00000144"/> 276         CHESTNUT WOOD. strong heart, thou hast fought valiantly ; enter now upon thy rest! The wings of prayer are bearing up the thanks of the frail, weak womnan, by thy side, to Him, the omniscient Giver of all good; but hast thou not, of thine own right hand. wrought out this salvation? Is there any call on thee for gratitude?-gratitude?-to zltom? The hour allotted for the preparation of the supper at the tavern came, and passed. The soothed temper of the crusty landlady was no proof against over-done chickens and cold tea, and, as if there was some magic connection between it and the hands of the old kitchen clock, it progressed in exact ratio with the onward movement of the hands, so that, when full sixty minutes after twelve had passed, and it rung out the small hour of one, the woman's patience had reached its minutest point, and forthwith disappeared altogether. Even the more genial host began to exhibit marks of cha- grin, and if their coming had been delayed much longer, it is to this day a doubtful question whether they would have gained admittance that night, but just as the creaking bolt was about to be forced once more to do its duty, two men were seen slowly walking towards the house.  ' There they are!" said the landlady, who, of course, would catch the first sight of them, "but I thought you said there were three of them?" "I certainly counted three. They must have left the woman somewhere.  Don't matter; I shall charge the same, and save the meal."  "I wonder where they have been, and where they hare left her, and who she was, and where they came from?" said the hostess, her curiosity again getting the better of her temper. But she received no answer. The landlord had gone to open the door, and she heard Jerry say, in his pleasantest tones: tO1108:i ,    .   "i EOTT;'uTr wooD.      2" '"Now, this 'ere is too bad, that's sartaini-to knock you up at this time of night, and then keep you waiting so; I'd be as cross as fury, if I were you; I know I would." The hostess was conciliated. If she were expected to be cross, of course she should be pleasant, so she advanced with a courtesy, and ushered them into her best parlor, in which the long tallow candles had been burning for a full hour, and had been snuffed and re-snuffed, she could not tell how many times. Certainly they did not require it now, for her hand had been upon them; the last thing, before she gave her final look for the tardy guests. Jerry said he would look after his horses, if the landlord would lend him a lantern, and as he passed through the kitchen, with that ready Yankee wit which, while it knows its own place, never wil- lingly talks of servant before strangers, said carelessly, "You had better give the gentleman his supper, right off; it will take me some time to look to the horses; I can as well eat artcrwards, you know." There was no withstanding Jerry's good-natured way, and so, though it would keep them up still later, the meal was immediately served, and Mr. Atherton called. What was their chagrin when he said, "he was too weary to wish to eat. They might call his man; he would promise he would make ample amends for any deficiency on his part, and he himself would be satisfied with being shown immediately to his room." This request the landlord complied with, internally re- solving, as he went along, that he would now charge for two uneaten suppers, instead of one. But, as Mr. Atherton had promised, Jerry made ample amends, and perhaps it was not more than fair, after he had finished, that charge should be made for three. Long after the host and hostess were once more at liberty to finish their night's rest, they heard slow and measured  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7088-00000145"/> 278        CHESTNUT WOOD. steps up and down Mr. Atherton's room. Their very mono- tony at length proved soporific to the landlord, but his wife became so curious to know the cause of such unceasing perambulations that, as she afterwards frequently averred, "her eyes were set as wide open as if they had had pegs in them, and she felt the next day, for all the world, as though she had been watching," but towards morning the walking ceased, the house became still, and if we may judge by the late hour at which the creaking bolt was once more withdrawn, the morning naps were undisturbed. Sybil was pronounced by all, even by Mr. Atherton him- self, not sufficiently well to bear the thirty miles drive to Chestnut Wood, on the next day, so it was decided that Miss Rogers should remain with her a few days at Mrs. Wallace's, and then they should both be sent for home. Sybil had never been allowed to give more than a partial ac- count of where she had been during her absence. Her cheeks became immediately so red, and her eyes so dull, that it was deemed best to divert her mind from any thoughts of it, until her body should be much stronger ; therefore all the information Mr. Atherton could gain was vague and imper- fect, serving only to confirm him in his worst fears, and his brow was clouded and his manner abrupt and stern during their drive home. Jerry's own heart felt so light and happy that he could not understand his master's mood. He had too great a respect for Mr. Atherton to attribute it to any but the best of motives, yet what those motives were, that was the puzzle to his unsuspicious nature. He ventured upon several different topics of conversation, such as he had usually found were interesting; but no, he only received the same short, impatient answer; so at last, weary of his unsuc- cessful efforts to amuse, he, too, much to Mr. Atherton's re- lief, relapsed into silence, not even making a remark, when they came full in sight of Chestnut Wood. He, however,   CHESTNUT WOOD.         279 snapped the whip with peculiar glee, when Mr. Atherton had entered the house, and he was alone with his horses, and broke out into, "It ain't the sociablest ride I ever had, nohow you can fix it. I wonder what a man's tongue was given him for, if it wasn't to use it; mine fairly aches, keeping so still. Gee up, there, boys!-what you arter? Whoa, I say-whoa!" And certainly if Jerry's tongue ached from having been so long in the position of silence, he meant to make amends for it now, if we may judge by the noise he made. All who camle in contact with him that day had the full benefit of the slilht restraint it had undergone, for he was very free in detailing what he knew of Sybil's adventures. Palmy Fitch had many " little palpitations of the heart," he proved so un- usually agreeable; and even old Dinah felt her organ of veneration for him increasing so rapidly, as he sat with his bright, happy face by her bed, that she almost paid him the greatest compliment which she ever paid, that of asking him "to' take old Pomp's Bible and read aloud to her." This request she was only kept from making by a certain comic expression which she felt was not in keeping with that holy book; and so, Jerry was allowed to laugh and talk in his own wild way without a check. Sybil had expressed much unwillingness to part with her grandfather, even for a few days; but she was easily quieted by the promise of soon going to him; and of having Aunt lary and Charles remain close by her while she was at Mrs. Wallace's. Charles had returned unexpectedly the day on which they had come from Chestnut Wood, for a short vaca- tion. He had usually spent this at the school, pursuing his studies; but now he could not resist coming home, when he knew Sybil was there, and sick. The boy's heart inclined him so naturally to be by her, that he neither questioned nor wondered at its promptings, but quietly took his way to l1ci,.  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7088-00000146"/> 280         CtESTNUT WOOD. A few hours after Mr. Atherton had left, Sybil was taken from her bed, dressed, the large wooden rocking. chair was carefully covered with soft blankets, and she was lifted into it. Nep came and sat down by her feet, restingg his nose upon them, and every now and then looking up into'her face with all the love of a human heart written in his eyes. Aunt Mary sat on one side of her, carefully untwining the long, matted, silken curls, so neglected; for Mrs. Wallace only made matters worse, whenever she attempted to arrange them; and now, as one after another fell gracefully over the pale face, she would often put them aside, and kiss, in quiet gratitude, the wan cheek. Charles was on the other side, watching each movement of Aunt Mary's gentle fingers, as if they were to produce something more than untangled hair. H-e so longed to twine one around his own finger, as he saw her-but, boy as he was, he could not; he would have given much to have pressed her lips-lightly-oh, so lightly-as she did; but he could not. He longed to take that little lily hand in his-but le could not; and so he sat-and like Nep, looked in her face, and smiled when she smiled; and the cloud passed over his manly features, as some unpleas- ant memory for a moment darkened hers. No one seemed inclined to speak. It was better for the child to be kept quiet; and the child's good was the one great object. Mrs. Wallace bustled about, in all the " pomp and pride " of good housekeeping. She set Sybil's room, in a very noiseless manner, nicely to rights, and contented herself with leav- ing her to those who were so competent to care for her, only retaining the right to enforce quiet and silence. But Sybil was now beyond the reach of danger. She protested, when it came the hour for her to retire again to bed, that she was well-perfectly well-and would walk out. She could not be kept so still any longer.   CHESTNUT WOOD.         281 "Only to-day, Sybil,' she made Mrs. Wallace at last promise; "'to-morrow, if you are as well, you shall do as 'yoa please." And to-morrow she was much better, so much that she refused the blanket for the chair, and began to talk as rapidly, as the group arranged itself around her, as in her healthiest days. Aunt Mary had satisfied herself that it could now do no harm, and with a delight, equalled only by Charles's, they listened once more to the dear voice. How the child prattled to then! inow, it was "of the old woman, with one arm, whom Aunt Mary immediately iden- tified with the one whom she had seen in Dinah's cottage; and now, of Nancy and her kindness-of the books and toys she had bought her; of the attic-room, and the visit of Billings, to which she owed her liberty. Then, she told of her wanlderings around the great city-and of the long bridge sIe passed-alnd h]ow dark and deep the waters were that rolled beneath it; and of the beautiful star that went before ler, until she slept, and papa Wallace found her." No one asked her a question. They did not even inter- rupt her; only occasionally Charles drew himself up, and his eye flashed with ill-repressed anger; and Aunt Mary put her arm still more closely around the child. It was a remarkable circumstance that Sybil did not mention Brown, until closely questioned by her grandfather, when no one else was present. Then she gave, as well as her frightened and wearied state at the time would allow her to recollect, a fall description of what he had said and done, and his per- sonal appearance-but asked no question, as her grandfather had feared she would. "My darling child,'" said Aunt Mary, soothingly, as aLc finished her recital, "what would have become of you, if your heavenly Father had not watched over you?" But he did, dear Aunt Mary; and many times,  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7088-00000147"/> 282         CHESTNUT WOOD,  when I was all alone, and oh! so afraid I should s ee that frightful woman coming into my room, I used to kneel down  and ask God not to leave me; and sometimes it seemed to me almost as if I could hear him speak and say, ' Be not afraid ;' and then I used to think I never could be so timid tagain. Don't you think He made Nancy kind to me, and made her love nme? for she was not at first; she used to speak loud, and quick, and frighten me almost as much as Moll. Poor Nancy! once I told her about Christ, and how lie died for us; and I think the beautiful story made her weep, for when I looked up in her face, I sa w tears in her eyes, and she never spoke so cross to me afterwards. Don't you think Christ would like to lave her love himl, Aunt Mary, if she should try to be good, and come away from that wicked place,. and live with us at Chestnut Wood? '? "No-she shall never come to Chestnut Wood," said Charles, angrily. "She shall go to prison; she shall have solitary confinement. Wlhen I am a man, I will be a lawyer; and there is not a spot on the earth that shall hide ler, or that old woman, or that wicked. man. As true as there is law or justice in the lanld, they shall be hanged-all -every one of them." " ' Oh no, Charlie," said Sybil; looking in his face with as supplicating a look as if upon his fiat did indeed depend the life of all, " not Nancy; for she was kind to me-so kind that I shall always love her." "Love her, Sybil! why I feel as if I could tear her in pieces ;" and the boy began pacing up and down the room in uncontrollalfe agitation. "Gently, gently, Charles," said Aunt Mary, speaking in her mildest tone. "Sybil is quite right. :Nothing for the erring like a Saviour's love : it was for such as Nancy that Christ died. To forgive an injury-to wish well to those   Cl'rT-:NUT WOOD.        283 who have only done us harmi-it were surely nobler, more manly3 more Christian, Charles." ':I can't help it, Miss Rogers.  I only wish I was a man and not a boy; that I could act, instead of talk- then- ' "Then, Charles, I hope you would both act as a man and a. Christian--' "And an avenger!" ," No-- Vengeance is mine: I will repay, saith the Lord."' Charles was silenced: he came again and seated himself by Sybil's'side, and she laid her hand on his, and half in admiration, and half in rebuke, looked earnestly into his eyes. Then, from hers went into the boy's soul the liv- ing clement of love and kindness, and a softened ray was nmirrored there which told her, without a word, that the storm was past. A bright rainbow arching from her heart to his, and over the brilliant pathway went gentle, loving thoughts. Aunt Mary saw it all, and wisely was silent: no moral' lesson could have done half so well; and then she led the conversation away from the past to the future, and drew fi'om Charles many of his hopes and plans: and while they thus talked, Sybil still kept her eyes fixed upon the boy's face; and, allost without knowing it, he grew eloquent, and painted that coming life which only exists for the sons of genius. And now, the fire within his soul warmed and lighted that of the little, eager, listening girl: and back upon that brilliant pathway, went high hopes and bright, Lambitious dreams! So wiled away, the time came quickly when Aunt Mary and Sybil must leave mamma Wallace's, and return once more to Chestnut Wood. Charles was to accompany them; Jerry to come for them. Her grandfather too, perhaps; and so the parting, which was always sad to Sybil, was made  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7088-00000148"/> 284         CHESTNUT WOOD. now comparatively light; and when the horses'stood pawing at the door, hardly obedient to Jerry's imperative coim- nalnds, she threw her arms around Mamma Wallace's neck, nor moved them until her grandfather put her carefully on to the little bed prepared for her in the carriage. As they passed through the village of Hymeswold, Jerry drew up his horses at every indication of a wish to speak to them, so that Sybil's return home had quite the air of a triumphal entry. Miss Palmy Fitch came out and leaned over the gate, and looked so much less sour and sharp, had so much less in her personal appearance to remind one of the continually-pointed nature of her avocation, that even Jerry said, as he called out to her,  "Well done, now! Miss Palmy.   I never seed you looking half so well; joy is really becoming to you, any how; and here we are, Sybil and all." Sybil's pale face was at the window, and knocking imlpatiently upon it, she soon lad it raised; then, putting out, her head, she said: "Thalnk you, Miss Palmy, for being glad to see me home. I am so glad to come. I wish you would come close here, and let mle kiss you." Palmy had not been kissed by a child for these ten years past, and she felt as awkwardly now as many younger and fairer maidens have been known to do on other occasions; but she came forward ; dropped her peculiar little courtesy, w\hen she saw Mr. Atherton and Aunt Mary, and put up her drawn-in mouth for the salutation. Sybil's lips were n ot conscious of the want of warmth in those they touched; they had in themselves sufficient for both. The parsonage door was wide open; and, as soon as the carriage caime in sight, IMattie darted from it down the street. Nep bounded toward her, and nearly overturned her in the violence of his demonstrative joy; but Mattie sprang to her feet again, and dodging by him, before Jerry could   (rTIlElTNT' WOOD(,.      285 fairly stop the spirited horses, was climbing up the steps. A screamn was heard from the parsonage, as the wheels rolled on, and the child was left so entirely at their mircy; but she was light and agile, and Mr. Atherton's strong halnd had grasped her and held her firmly; but Mattie only saw. Sybil, only tlought of once more having her arms around her neck; and so, the children, clasped in each other's arms, rode on until Jerry halted at the door of the parsonage. God be thanked, Mr. Atherton!" said Mr. Rogers, the tears filling his pale blue eyes. "This our child was lost, and is found! Sybil Thornton, how do you do?  Mrs. Rogers was by his side weeping aloud,-the foun- tain of the good lady's tears was always full; always ready to overflow. It needed but the slightest touch--the waters bubbled up fresh, and, what was rare, hearty; so she stood now, her handkerchief at her face, not attempting to utter any other language than that of tears. "Are. you not glad to see me, Mrs. Rogers?" asked Sybil wonderingly, as she looked at her. "Gla-a-d; " said Mrs. Rogers, trying to press an out- ward expression, so little in unison with her internal feelings. "Glad is not the word. I am rejoiced-thankful-happy- delighted ; so glad, that all I can do is to cry like-like-a baby. Oh, Sybil, Sybil! how I have prayed for this mo- ment!" Mr. Atherton was too much of a gentleman to smile at any appearance of feeling, but as he looked from the worthy minister to his wife, he felt very much inclined to. "It takes all sorts of varieties to mlake a world," he thought, "' and this clerical profession seems to gather into its fold the odds and ends; what a ridiculous scene!"Aunt Mary seemed to divine his thoughts; for, with the quickness which her resi- dence in the family of her brother had often before rendered it necessary for her to use, she said:  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7088-00000149"/> i)86        'CHESTNUT UWOOD. "Sister, have not you a nice little bit of sponge cake ready for us? We have had a long ride, and Sybil must be hungry." "Yes, in a moment,' answered Mrs. Rogers, making a final use of her handkerchief. "Some just baked to-day- fresh and light,--only wait until I bring it." So she dis- appeared, and in a moment returned with no trace of tcars, her face looking as if the sun had just broken out upon it after a shower. Mattie, in the mean time, had run in for her bonnet, and the family were all together in the carriage when they stopped at the door of Chestnut Wood. There stood all the different inmates of the house, arranged according to rank, with much care, by the attentive Mrs. Giles. Maggy was among the first to break through the order, for no sooner did she catch sight of "' her darlint," than, tumbling over Mrs. Giles, catching her foot in the door-mat and measuring her length head first down the steps, and finally knocking against even Mr. Atherton himself, she caught the child with the strength of a giantess, and began almost devouring her with kisses. When Aunt Mary interfered, she caught her breath and ejaculated: "Blessed Virgin!--Itoly Mary!--and it's pay you well, I will, indade it is. lMaggy MceMann was never ungrateful."' And so Sybil was at home once more-safe at Chestnut W ood; thinner and paler-less light-hearted and hapLply than when last there. Over her life the shadow had begun to fall, and for long years. she was destined to walk amid its darkness.   CHAPTER XIV. IT must not be supposed that every thing immediately as- sumed its usual routine at Chestnut Wood. Charles's re- turn with Sybil, would naturally have made some difference; but now, Sybil herself was not well enough for steady em- ployiment, and therefore neither books nor work were thought of. Even Mattie had leave of vacation; and the three grow- ing children were left pretty much to their own way of spending time.  Their ingenuity in devising methods was quite a matter of amusement both to Mr. Atheriton and Aunt Mfary. Charles had begun to lose the boy; and the color which would come into his cheek, when-detected in some chldish sport, and yet the honest way in which he made no effort to conceal it, pleased Mr. Aflherton, as indi- cating at once a manly and truthful character, and he had several times himself joined in their play in order to show Charles that he thought there was nothing at all derogatory in his mingling in little girls' sports. In thus doing he showed both his tact and his kindness, and the man rose , much in the boy's estimation.  Perhaps there is hardly to be found a  better test of true character than in a child's opinion.  Children have a wonderful intuition for what is good, and a keen shrinking from what is wrong in the char- acter of others.  "I would rather," said a man remarkable  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7088-00000150"/> IS8         CtiEST'L TUT i'WO.  for his owl quick knowledge of human nature, " have boys think well of me than men. Never offend one! never!" Sybil, at first, was more willing to be amused than to amuse. She sscmed listless; often absent and thoughtfull: and wlhen questioned as to the subjects of her tlhoughts, would reply, "I was only thinking of old Moll, or Nancy e or some person who had been around her during her absence. lBut in proportion as these moods came over S;ybil, MJattic's life and spirits seemed to increase. She was always ready both to suggest the sport, and to be first in carrying it into execution. Aunt M3ary was relieved from the necessity of diverting Sybil, Mattie did it all. As Sybil grew stronger they were much out of doors, and as soon as they could be allowed, Mattie's plans for diversion were endless. One, which she considered the final stroke of success, was too ludicrous to pass unnoticed. Mattie was by nature quite a minic; this faculty she took every occasion to strengthen, though, unfortunately, it subjected her to many reproofs; for, like all lmimics, she seized upon the weak points, the foibles, or the natural deformities of individuals, and made these the subjects of her mirthl. Her mother had been alarmed many times, when Mat- tie was quite young, and she had accompanied her to sonme religious meeting, to find the child taking her large black eyes suddenly away from some' speaker, and lifting them up to her, begin with precisely his look and manner to re- peat to her the words he had been using.  This was al- ways done in a whisper; but the likeness was too exact, and if any one else-if the man himself, had seen her, what might happen?  She dared not even think of it.  Oine of their deacons-good old pious man that he was-had an inveterate habit of taking snuff. This he always in- dulged most freely when under any little excitement; therefore, when about to address a gathering of the church,  CHESTNUT \OOD.         2 89 his staff box was invariably in his hands; and his deep, sonorous, but very nasal voice, was accompanied contin- ually ith little short taps upon its lid. To any one of humorous propensities, this always afforded much amuse- nicnt; but for the church generally, it had ceased to, be even an object of notice ; they listened to the old man's good ex- hortation;, and forgot the accompanying music,--but not so with Mattie; her attention was at once arrested and kept until the deacon took his scat, and unless her mother held both of her hands tightly in hers, she never failed to tap upon the hymn-book and help herself with thumb and finger froim its goodly contents, as if the hymns, like the deacon's snuff, could in that way find access to the brain. For this she had been punished many times: but a keen, observant eye for eccentricities was natural to the child, and no chas- tisement could eradicate it. Even the worthy minister him- self did not always escape his daughter's observation. He had, from his long residence in the country, acquired a habit of public speaking eminently countrified. He began all his sentences in a loud, full voice, iicreasing in tone and strength until he reached the middle, and then dropping gradually until the last word was scarcely audible. In his prayers, this manner was particularly conspicuous; and often Mattie's mother was shocked by hearing the child, when repeating her own morning and evening devotions, suddenly drop her na- tural tone and exactly imitate the peculiar one of her father. Once, while the child was busy playing meeting-a favor.. ito play of hers, as it is apt to be of most ministers' children -her father had the curiosity to remain an unseen specta- tor, and could not but immuediately recognize himself in the voice of the child. To a little more sensitive nature, this might have been a good lesson; but the worthy pastor only considered it a proof of the theological doctrine of native depravity; and coming suddenly from his hiding-place upon VOL.

Mattie had a detected feeling, though she had really meant nothing wrong; still she pouted, and certainly then exhibited sufficient of the depravity. The frolic for the last night of Charles's stay with themi could not be carried into execution without coaxing Jerry into the affair; and this the three together had no great dif- ficulty in doilg. They made him promise to observe tlhe strictest secresy; to be punctual and quiet, and very obe- dient to any commands it might be necessary to give him. To this last part, Jerry very wisely demurred; but it only required one "' Please do, dear Jerry," from Sybil's lips, and with his hat knocked very much upon the side of his head, Jerry gave the desired promise. Just as it began to grow dusk, the easy double-seated wagon was brought around to the door, and the children jumped in, Sybil being wrapped up in many unnecessary shawls-but as Aunt Mary was not made an entire confi- dant in the plan, it was the only way in which she would allow her to go from home after the sun went down, and even though thus carefully equipped, she sent many anxious thoughts after the party. The first place to which they drove, was Dinah's cottage. Sybil had been there several times to see the old negro-and the sight of her had done more toward Dinah's restoration than all the physician's prescriptions. "It was wonderful," he said himself, "' how much faster the bone had knit, since her mind was at ease.  If some sage physician could distil the oil of gladness, his fortune and fame would both be made; for now, he found a smile generally more beneficial than a pill, and nothing in the whole pharmacopeia equal to a merry heart." Mattie and Jerry disappeared within the door of the cottage, and were gone for some time; at length Jerry came out; it would take longer than they had thought; he   CHESTNUT WOOD.         9 1 must flsten the horse, and Sybil must go in and help them. Much humor was dancing on old Dinah's face as they went in-and no wonder i On her knees, in the large fireplace, knelt Mattie, with both hands most assiduously rubbing its back; as fast as she rubbed, she transferred her hands from thlt to her face, and when Sybil and Charles entered, had succeeded in changing her complexion to the oddest mixture of black and white imaginable. The end of her little nose was coal black ; so was a spot upon her forehead, and all her chin. She worked at the business so heartily, and with so much energy, that the only wonder was it was not already accomplished. Jerry and Charles began to assist her and never since old Pomp died had the negro cottage rang to such peals of laughter. At length, not a white spot was left. Mattie rose from her knees transformed into the veriest ne- gro. Her own white teeth, and black, dancing eye, gave ad- ditional naturalness to her looks; and when she turned round, and dropping a courtesy-one of Dinah's own courte- sies, the courtesy of her palmiest days-and in her very tone and words gave her usual greeting, the old creature laughed until the tears ran down her furrowed cheeks. Then, to put on one of Dinah's black petticoats, white short- gowns, white caps, and the kerchief about the neck, was quickly done. Dinah was small and delicate; the healthy child Mattie was already fully as tall, and perhaps the stouter and heavier of the two, but all declared the dress a perfect fit, and Jerry, between his bursts of laughter, said, "If it were Dinah herself she could not look more nat'ral, or a speck more like a born nigger." Now the hood and plaid cloak, sent as a present by I'almy Fitch on the event- ful day of Dinah's return to the cottage, were once more taken from the trunk in which they had been carefully de- posited, and even the red and yellow shawl was not forgotten.  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7088-00000152"/> 292         CHESTNUT WOO)D. When duly attired, Mattie went to the side of the bed, and made many courtesies and many promises of " not doing the slightest discredit to Mrs. Dinah Lovejoy." "During their ride to Hymeswold, nothing could inducec Mattie for a mioment to forget her disguise. You would never have recognized the merry child in the old octoeilni rian negro. She could be neither surprised or coaxed into  any other character, and the few brief remarks 6ashe nmade were such as in very truth Dinah would have uttered Itad she been present. As they came in sight of the parsonage, she gave two or three little chuckling laughs; no one knew but Mattie that to-night was the night for the female prayer-meeting, and that she should probably make her appearance there in its very midst. Under such circumstances, Sybil could not have been induced to have gone.  Charles's sense of pro- priety would have withheld him ; and Jerry's obstinate good-nature; lie would not have troubled the parson nor his wife, "no, not for nothing." But neither reverence, pro- priety, or good-nature withheld Mattie. Reverence was not a part of her nature, and her education had not remedied the deficiency. Her sense of propriety never was able to withstand her love of fun, and her good-nature, in which she was not at all deficient, made her seek for every opportunity of amusing others. To bring Dinah Lovejoy suddenly ilhto the little sitting-room of the parsonage to attend the meet- ing, seemed to her mirth-loving heart the best joke 'in the world; and in her extenuation, be it said, she had intended to behave with the strictest propriety, and closely to pre- serve her incognito until the assembled ladies should have dispersed. Fortunately, however, for all concerned, the length of time required to change complexions at the cottage, had been greater than Mattie had anticipated; and when the carriage   ,HilsriNlln ' otuD.     g293 stoppcd at a little distance from the parsonage the " sisters" were already dispersing. As one after another came so quietly and meekly out of the gate, Jerry whispered, ' La! now, Mattie, how nigh you came to being caught." Mattie only laughed, and shook her head; to her, the crear of the joke was gone. They remained in the carriage until tle ladies were out of sight; then, after a careful survey up and down the street, Dinah was lifted out quite as gently as ler age and infirmities required. Before she knocked at the side door, Sybil, Charles, and Jerry had gone very softly in at the wood-house, and through that into the kitchen, and then into a large closet, one door of which opened into the sitting-room, and was always, as Mattie said, left a little open so as to hear if any one came into the kitchen. Having given them now, as she thought, sufficient timne to creep in alud secrete themselves there, she gave a long rap upon the door, which immediately arrested the attention of the party witlhin. It was an odd rap-very unlike what they were ac- customed to hear; and although Mrs. Rogers always made it a point of duty to open the door herself, she now looked toward her husband. Tlhewife of the good deacon, whose public performanices were so largely indebted for their elo- quence to the snuff-box, had lingered after the rest of the ladies had taken their leave, to chat a little over the affairs of the parish. She was Mrs. Rogers's bosom friend, and to I'o one, hardly excepting her husband, did the minister's wife so unburden her heavy load of parochial responsibilities. 'The unha ppy domestic condition of one of the leading mem- bers of the church, was a fruitful source of consultation ; Land orow, a new quarrel having just come to their knowledge, they had been busy in adjudging to each their respective share of the blame, when the knock was icard upon the door. c]()  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7088-00000153"/> 294         CHESTNUT WOOD. It must be confessed that the old and not very minis- terial adage-of the immediate nearness of a certain indi- vidual when spoken of, was .the first thing which occurred to Mrs. Rogers, and she would hardly have been surprised to have seen t]he whole family of whom they had been talkinl, from the father down to the baby in arms, enter. M1r. Rogers, as soon as he fairly comprehended that it was for him and not for his wife to open the door, rose and went to it; but his exclamation of surprise' soon brought )Mrs. Rogers to his side. "Ah, ah-indeed!" he said, shading the lamp with his hand, and looking steadily in Dinah's face; "I amb surprised, very much surprised-very much surprised, indeed. It is Mrs. Dinahl Lovejoy, I believe." Dinah smiled, courtcsied, and asked, "If Mrs. Rogers was at home . " "She is. Will you walk in?" said the linister, with as much courtesy as if hle were addressing the most influen- tial of his flock. ' I am surprised, as I remarked, Mrs. Lovejoy, to see you here, and at night, too. Walk in, do."' Dinah stepped in, and as Irs. Rogers's eyes fell upon her, she lifted up both hands and exclaimec, "WThat on earth does it mean! Dinah, I am as glad to see you as if you were the first lady in. the land;-" and she took the black hand in hers, and would lhave given it one of her good, cor- dial shakes-a shake which 2meant something--whenl} Dinah, alarnmed at what would be the probable consequence, dropled her little courtesy, and withdrew it; then sat down at oDcu on the chair which Mr. Rogers had placed for her. The deacon's witfh stared in undisguised, astonishment; if old Pomp himself hlad walkedi in, it would scarcely have sur- prised her more. Never had Dinah been seen in the village before, since the first few years of her residence at the podcl -excepting on the Sabbath ; and now, since Pomp's death, she had not come even then. Moreover, it was well known   CHESTNUT WOOD,         295 that a few weeks ago her limb had been broken; and as the bones of aged persons are proverbially long in healing, she was not supposed to be as yet able to move from her bed. Still here, in very truth, she was; with her same dress- her snowy cap, whose broad frill lay rather more than usual over the forehead and down upon the cheek, so at least Mrs. Rogers thought-but Dinah said, "the light was bad for her old eyes-and, with their leave, she would turn her back to it," so soon after coming in, that Mrs. Regers hardly had a fair view of the face. At first, none of the party seemed inclined to talk much. Surprise kept the inmates of the house silent; and Dinah had her own reasons for not wishing to sustain more than her part in the conversation; but Mrs. Rogers's curiosity was not long to be kept down from any restraint, so she broke out with, "Well now! Dinah! I am glad to see you,--but this is the queerest fieak I ever knew. How did you get here?" "Massa Jerry, bless him! toted me up here in his wagon. "But where," interrupted the deacon's wife, "is your broken leg? I thought the last time I sent you down your lump of butter, Sally said it was only getting well very slowly." "Very slow, Missus; me so bad-so much pain-so groan-so cry. Mass' Jerry said he bring me up to meet- ilg, to pray the Lord please make old Dinah well." "Bring you up to meeting, Dinah!" exclaincd Mr. Rogers ; "why, did Mr. Jerry Goldsmith think it was the Salbbath? I must say I am surprised." "Female prayer-meeting, my dear, he probably meant," said Mrs. Rogers. "It was very thoughtful in him." "Ah, yes-yes-I beg your pardon, wife,-seeing Dinah  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7088-00000154"/> 296         CHESTNUT WOOD. so suddenly has m-ade me quite forget. You can walk, then, now, can you, Mrs. Lovejoy?  "A leetle-jes a lectie, Massa. God give old Dinlah strength to come to meeting; but I am cery bad-very biad indeed. Mch pain-much groan ; old nigcer want to g'o up in the golden cliariot with the satin slippes." Both Mr. and Mrs. Rogers had been frequent visitors to the cottage, and were quite ftamiliar with Dinah's forms of religious expression; so Mrs. Rogers went on with, "And sit down with Polmp in the new home, with the sparkling crown and the golden harp, and sing-sing-sing-praises for ever." "Bless the Lord!" ejaculated old Dinah, fervently, ' me all ready-all waiting to go up. Pray for the comlling of the golden chariot."- "But I don't see as you go lame much ;" persisted the deacon's wife, still intent upon the broken limb. "It seems to me as if you had got well marvellously quick!" Bless the Lord!" said Dinah, lifting up both of her hands. Y' es-tliat is right, Mrs. Lovejoy," chimed in the minister. "In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and Hie shall direct thy path." "Then shalt thlo walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble," added 3rs. Rogers, in an encouragingo tone; she paused, evidently expecting Dinah to add another appropriate text, as was her wont-but Dinah only ejacu- lated- "'Bless the Lord!" and at this instant Mrs. Rogers turned her head quickly toward the kitchen door; she had heard a sound; Mr. Rlogers's eyes followed the direction of hers-but he only said, "It was the cat jumping out of her chair." Jerry's face sobered in a moment: he had been surprised into an invol-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         297 untary burst of laughter, very smothered to be sure,but still sufficiently loud, as it had proved, to catch Mrs. Rogers's quick ear. He drew his lips together with his great hand, and held them as tightly as if they were in an iron vice, but he hoped the farce would not last much longerb he was sure lie could not remain sober. "1As lMrs. Lovejoy has come so far purposely to unite with us in a little meeting, perhaps it would be best-" sug- gested Mr. Rogers, but Mrs. Rogers knew what the close of the sentence was to be, and as she was not then in a very devotional frame of mind, she interrupted it with, "Perhaps it would; I dare say she is faint, and would relish a hot cup of tea and a bit of cake. Now, Dinah, if you would only say so, for it really wouldn't be the least trouble for me to get it for you." It was one of the articles of Mrs. Rogers's creed that there were three things which were necessary for success in the pastoral life; these three, she would often say, were first, hospitality; second, hospi- tality; and third, hospitality; and she carried her belief in this into every day practice, so that, for miles around, no house was so noted and so imposed upon for its hospitality as the little poorly-supported parsonage of Hymeswold. It therefore seemed not at all irreverent or irrelevant to the minister when his wife thus changed the offer of spiritual for temporal nourishment, but Dinah respectfully declined the tea, though she visibly lingered over the cake. This Mrs. Rogers noticed, and said, "Perhaps you would taste a bit of sponge-cake; I have some that I made for little Sybil Thornton." The offer was not again declined, and for a moment, as Mrs. Rogers rose to go for it, there was a visible perturbation in the closet; but Mattie had not betrayed them. The cake was kept in the air-tight tin box, always in one corner of the china closet, upon the opposite side of the room from where the hidden party were, and they saw a VOL.

"How in natur' will she eat with them 'ere hands," Jerry ventured to whisper; but Mrs. Rogers's head was turned again towards the closet, in a listening attitude, and Sybil's finger was upon her lips. Dinah uttered many fervent expressions of gratitude, and commenced eating with a hearty relish, wlich did not imply any loss of appetite from her late confinement in bed. Piece after piece rapidly disappeared, and nMrs. Rogers had risen with the intention of filling the plate with a plainer kind of food, when her attention was again arrested by a sound from the closet. The mirth which had been accumu. lating for some time there, was beginning to be too much for the narrow compass in which it was obliged to confine itself and in spite of Jerry's tight hold upon his lips, it had broken out of the corners of his mouth, in a short, quick choke, that Sybil had echoed with a suppressed titter. To their astonishment, it caime btack fromll Dinah, but with so exact an imitation of the old negro that it served to divert Mrs. Rogers frolm investigating her kitchen apartments. "It's all up, now,"' said Jerry to hinmself; but no, Dinah with admirable presence of mind, said, "La, Missus, it make old Dinah laugh to tink how you stole her rule for making cake, and now you beat her clean out; oh, fie! Missus, fie!" and then Dinah continued to laugh, both longer and louder, Mr. Rogers began to think, than the occasion demanded; so did the deacon's wife, but Mrs. Rogers was too much interested in the disappearance of her cake to notice it, and bringing the plate of cookies, with the feeling that old Diinah must be ver'y hungry, she put that, too, down by the side of the other nearly empty plate; but Dinah evidently preferred the sponge, and with a   CHESTNUT WOOD.         299 series of little pleased laughs, very trying to some of the listeners, finished all that was upon the'plate. Dinah's usual modesty certainly had forsaken her, for after scarcely a decent pause, she attacked the second. One cooky--two--and her hand was stretched out for the third. Mr. Rogers's face had gradually lost every other expression but that of surprise ; so had the deacon's wife. Mrs. Rogers's, notwithstanding her three rules, was fast assuming the same expression, when she again heard a noise from the kitchen. This timne it was too distinct to admit a doubt of its being sozcet/Whig, so she hastily took up a lamp, and without turn- ing her head to the right or left, walked straight towards the closet door. She heard the sound of quick footsteps---heard them so distinctly that there was no possibility of mistake, and taking a step backwards, slammed the door to, and be- gan to turn the lock, in all imaginable haste. While she was accomplishing this, and the minister was trying to recover wits enough to ask what she was doing, Dinah suddenly rose from her chair, and to the petrifaction of the deacon's wife, commenced a series of antics with her broken limb, such as would not lave shamed an Ellsler. "-Dinah!-Dinah  Lovejoy!"  ejaculated the really alarmed Mr. Rogers, " what is the matter?" Between the noise Dinah made, scampering about the floor, and the noise the others made, scampering back to continue their observations through the key-hole, Mrs. Rogers did not know which way to look, or what to do; it scarcely secmed less strange that Dinah Lovejoy should be up with her broken limb, dancing around her parlor, than that any one should have dared enter her kitchen, and be dancing about there!--yet there she stood, and both sounds smote almost palpably upon her ears. "Husband!" at length she said, leaving the door, and catching him by the arm, " there is some one in the kitchen."  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7088-00000156"/> 300         CHESTNUT nOOD. "And Dhiah Lovejoy!" was all the answer she receivedc as Dinall capered close up to him, and extending her arms, seemed inclinled to clasp them around his neck. tL has gone stark mad!-and the people in the kitchen. ' Never did break her leg, I will take my oath of it," muttered the deacon's wife, beginning to tremble. The slandered memlber was immediately laid in her lap, accompanied by every sign of acute pain. She pushed it from her as if it had been a serpent, and lhad stung her, and springing from her chair, lifted hands and eyes in such a lu- dicrous picture of amazement and affrirghtl, that a clear laugoi caime through' te key-hole.9' "Husband!--don't you hear them? '; But no; Mrs. Rogers stood with his eyes fixed upon the antics of the negr wo1man, spell-bound. He could not ehave moved hand or foot. "She is crazy!-but the folks in the kitchllen,. hlsbanld! There, dear me. I shall go madl myself if you don't go and see. Husband!-husband!" and a good hearty shake upon his shoulder slowly recalled the husband to his duties as master of the house. But his look, as he turned to the door, was almost piteous; perhaps it touched Dinah's heart, for she immediately commenced untying her bonnet with tlhe greatest haste. The string was in a knot, but a hearty pull soon broke it, and it fell upon the floor. Next followed the plaid cloak, and then pausing, as if the spirit of- full was not yet quite appeased, she dropped a series of courtesies, a,d  commenced another gallopade.  Suddenly stopping, for tlhe tears were gathering in Mrs. Rogers's eyes, she began to un- dress herself. The minister no sooner became aware of hel intention than, putting both hands before his eyes, he made a quick retreat towards the closet door. He turned tihe 'key, it flew open, and there stood Sybil, Charles, iand Jerry! At the same instant the black petticoat slipped off, and   CSELSTNUT WOOD.        301 Mattie s well-known gingham dress came in sight. A loud burst of laughter from the fun-seekers was met with io answering shout from the bewildered group in the sitting- room. Even Mattie's ringing, dearly-loved laugh, failed to make her clearly known, and it was not until the cap was re- moved,'and her long black hair fell in its rich masses of curls about her neck, that she was fully recognized. For once in their married life, Mr. Pogers's expression of feeling was the' quickest. Approaching the child, he shook her violently, and while his usually mild blue eye absolutely flashed with anger, he said, '"Matilda Rogers!-you hussy 'you!--you deserve a sound whipping!" To throw her arms around her father's neck, and choike the remainder of the reproof in kisses, was Mattie's ready way of silencing him ; but this was soon put a stop to by an exclamation from her mlother, when, on lifting up her head, such a picture as her fatlher presented! The spotless white of his laroge cravat and shirt bosom was covered with large patches of blacl; his pale face, moreover, and even his gray hair, had not escaped. Sybil clapped her hands and laughed in unrestrainable glee, and Jerry broke out with, "I say for't; I've hearn tell that our minister was kind of an abolitionist. I'll bet a cent they would- say he's in for amalgamation, if any on 'urn should see him now." That Mattie had inherited her love of fun from her mother there had never been any denying, and now, so divided were the good lady's feelings, between amusement and vexation, that she seemed incapable of indulging either. Mattie knew her well; and leaving her father, was about to give her the same caresses, when her mother caught and held her out at armn's length, saying, "Mattie!--Mattie Rogers!-you wild thing you!-   t what will become of you? I can't help laughing, for the life of me, how she did take off old Dinah," and then a long,  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7088-00000157"/> 302         CHESTNUT WOOD.  loud, heartfelt laugh, set all to rights in her own heart, and her irritated husband's. Even the deacon's wife laughed, though amid her rather forced cachinnations she was often heard to say, "I knew that Dinah never had a broken limb since she was born into the world." "What a child!"M rs. Rogers was constantly exclailm- ing, as she looked from one to another of her guests. "Who did she take that from? I am sure I never did such a thing in all my life, and as for her father, no one would ever sus- pect him of it. I don't see; it is a perfect mystery to me. Mattie, you are a very naughty, wild child, and I must take you home, and put you to work in the kitchen, and see if 1 can't get some of your wild oats out of you; you will disgrace us some day." Mattie made a threatening gesture, which implied a wish to come a little nearer, while she was receiv- ing the parental admonition, but her mother was on her guard, only she had a feeling of Mattie's having the game pretty much in her own hands, while she remained of a dif- ferent color, that was, on the whole, not very conducive to the exercise of authority. She was constantly obliged to act on the defensive, so all at once it suggested itself to her that a bowl of hot water and soap would remove this difficulty; seizing one of Mattie's arms, just above the hand, so as to hold that member in proper subjection, she commenced tugging her away towards the kitchen; and tugging it cer- tainly was, for Mattie, notwithstanding her age and the glimmer in her mother's eye, was forcibly reminded of times 1ong past, when she used to be dragged into the little bed- toom, leading out of the kitchen, for that summary punish- ment which Solomon has enjoined upon all good parents who love their children. It probably also suggested the same remembrances to Mr. Rogers, for with a half pleased, half apologetical look to the company in the sitting-room, he said,   CHESTNUT WOOD.         33 "She is a very wild child, and will some day come to harm, if she is not checked in season." La! now, Mr. Rogers," said Jerry, looking from him to the struggling child, ' I hope she ain't a going to whip her, 'cause Mattie meant no harm; I can answer for't, it wan't nothing but fun. Now, Mrs. Rogers, I had rather stand the whipping myself, than have her." Sybil had run to Mrs. Rogers, and catching her hand, was looking in her face with a mute, supplicating look, which no one, who had a heart as tender as Mattie's mother's, could resist; so, without answering, she took hold of Sybil gently with her free hand, andled both children away. "My dear, my dear," said Mr. Rogers, hurrying after them, " perhaps you are not thinking what you are doing; perhaps it would be as well to allow Sybil Thornton to re- main with us until you return,' and he looked at her, as was his wont, all the hidden meanings which, before others, lie did not like to express. "I know what I am doing, husband," she answered, a little testily. "You had better go back, and talk to the company." "Mrs. Rogers! ' again commenced the husband, in a most deprecatory tone, but the kitchen door was slammed, and all was for a moment silence in both rooms. Soon from the kitchen came hearty laughter, accompanied by the plash of water. "She is washing her," exclaimed the anxious father. "That ain't all, is it?" said Jerry, the whole expres- sion of his face suddenly changing. "Well, there was need enough on't, and it ain't every blacky that can get rid of their tawny skin quite so easy as she can. Perhaps, Mr. Rogers-no offence, now, I am sure-but perhaps a little of the same thing might take away from you abolitionism. I always said the minister had too much sense-too much  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7088-00000158"/> 304        CHESTNUT WOOD. mind-his-own-business about him-to have it more than skin-deep, and I am glad to see I had the right on't." O1h, yes. sir; excuse me a moment. Mattie is a very wild girl, and certainly deserves chastisement. I beg your pardon, I had entirely forgotten my-my abolitionism; I will return immediately;" so with a stately and somewhat formal bow, Mr. Rogers left the room, to investigate the condition of his face and linen, in his own apartment. When he returned, which was not for some time, it was with a much more troubled brow than he had left the room. He had not enough of internal dignity to bear unruffled the slightest infraction upon his external claims to respect, and his mottled and ludicrous appearance before Jerry, before Sybil, before the stranger young man, and especially before the deacon's wife, was too much for his irritated temper. Then-although he knew Jerry meant no harm-he was not altogether plecaed with his allusions to his slavery principles, for, in truth, they were much more than " skin deep," and he was only led to conceal them, more from fear of this very deacon, whose wife was present, than fromn any otler motive. The church generally he thought he could lead with him, but for Deacon Jones, particularly if his snuff-box was out, there was no hope.  Deacon Jones was a man of some property and much influence. He paid the largest minister's tax, and next to the minister, his opinion was considered of the most value by the community. "Paul had a thorn in his side." Mr. Rogers, though he was a humble man, and did not liken himself often to the wise and eloquent' apostle, still thought there was a marked resemblance between himself and the saint, in this respect; he, also, had a thorn in his, and what, he was sure, made it more intolerable than Paul's, it was a thorn of which le could not say openly, "There was given to me a thorn in i   CHESTNUT WOOD.         305 the flesh, the messenger of Satan, to buffet me, lest I should be exalted beyond measure." But this only served to in- crease the irritation, and sometimes Mr. Rogers felt as if he wiere really an oppressed man. Deacon Jones was conserva- tive-conservative in every thing. It had only been after niluch talking, on the minister's part, and much coaxing on his wife's, whom Mrs. Rogers won frequently over to their side of an argumlent, that the Deacon had consented to vote for remodelling the church-dispensing with the little, high pulpit, in which Mrs. Rlogers constantly averred that he felt ' like a sparrow perched upon a swinging bough of a tall tree "--or the seats, which were to be always lifted up, during the devotional part of the services, and then slammed down, with such force as was characteristic of their occu- pants. He always answered any direct appeal by "What was good enough for my father, is good enougl for me; I don't want to go to heaven one whit easier than the old gentleman did, and if I was only as sure of reaching there in the end, I should be content." There-was nothing so dangerous as opposition, for that only served to confirm him more strongly in his opinions ; so, after worshipping ten years longer than there was any neces- sity of doing in the old-fashioned church, because his money, if not his vote, was needed to remodel it, the society had at last resource to a stratagem to carry their point. P From time immemorial it had always been his pride to be the leading select man of the town. No matter what questions agitated the little community, or whether he voted for or against the public voice, his election was always sure. He did nothing to advance the growth of the town, but he preserved strict order and regularity in all the smaller matntcis. He enforced the pounding of the stray cattle; he insured the thorough mending and keeping in order of the highways; in short, he was the orderly spirit of the place, and much  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7088-00000159"/> 306        CHESTNUT WOOD. respected as such; but the meeting-house-it was behind the age-and though the Deacon's father had gone to a bet- ter world, and the Deacon, so far as they knew, was surely following in his footsteps, they felt as if their prospects for the future would be brightened by a more winning place of preparation for it here. What was the Deacon's astonish- ment to be informed, on the morning previous to the elec- tion, that the voters had decided to have town, after society meeting, and only to elect those to offices who agreed to unite heart and hand in rebuilding their church.. If a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet, the Deacon would not have been more startled. But he was a wise man; such a unanimous voice from the public was not to be heard with a deaf ear; so he not only entered heartily into the subject, when brought for- ward, but signed his name to a subscription nearly double that of any other person. Of course his town office was given to him almost by ac- clamation, and he had, in the end, more of the feeling of con- queror than of having been conquered. lIe even went so far as to propose a carpet, or rather not to demur much, when his wife, at Mrs. Rogers's instigation, suggested how hand- some it would be to have such a proposition come from him. He was like a great many other good old conservatives-- once get him started in the right direction, and he was pretty sure never to move in any other, and he accomplished more than a dozen other men, who were always planning improve- ments, and always talking of the necessity of active exertion to change and re-organize the present very faulty state of society. The church being fairly altered to Mr. Rogers's mind, the "' thorn in his flesh " became for a short time less trouble- some; but by and by one little difference after another grew up--Mr. Rogers being, perhaps, rather unduly anxious that his want of progress in his study should be compensated to   CHESTNUT WOOD.         307 his people by their progress in freedom from the great evils of the age, It is at any time so much easier to correct what is wrong, whlere we have no immediate concern, than it is to root up even the little evils that have struck deep, and will one day spread themselves like a green bay-tree, in our own domestic gardens. Mr. Itogers felt emphatically that in these things he was a laborer in the great vineyard. For the last three or four years the subject of slavery had lain very near his heart. Mrs. Rogers, from her natural charac- teristics, every one would expect to take the part of the suf- fering and oppressed, wherever found; she used her heart much more than her head, and had circumstances called her to the task, she would have mounted her horse, like Joan d'Arc, and led armies bravely on, "for God and country." She had periodical fits of abolitionism now.. Sometimes she would become so incensed at the report of wrong and outrage with which their weekly abolition paper was filled, that her indignation would know no bounds; and her hus- band would be tormented with fears that, like the other illustrious ladies with whose name and exploits the papers were so gloriously filled, she would forsake home and the quiet routine of duty, which Paul had pointed out as par- ticularly appropriate to the gentler sex, and standing on the public stage, would add her name and talent to the moral power that was so fast rending the chain of the slave. Sometimes, after an unusually animated discussion on her part, he would picture her in her best black silk dress, with her new cap trimmed with those bright pink ribbons, ex- horting others, as she was now exhorting him: but the pic turc was not pleasing to him; he had rather see her in that dark-colored calico dress, sitting quietly by his own hearthstone, busily engaged in knitting those blue stockings at once so handsome and so comfortable-looking gentle,  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7088-00000160"/> 308        CHESTNUT WOOlD. womanly, and homelike-: while he wielded the public cudgel, and raised his voice for freedom and equality. But the wedded life is one of equal rights and privileges: and if Mrls. Rogers could not, by one mlighty effort, give liberty and happiness to a whole down-trodden race, she had no special fancy for leaving her husband, to undertake the mission-particularly as it might involve in its progress the necessity of an exchange of the quiet ministry of Hymeswold for a more general, perhaps a cosmopolitan, parish. Judge, then, of her surprise and annoyance, when an en- thusiastic burst of indignation of her own, was followed by one more violent on his part. The arguments of a Webster himself would not have had any thing like the same power to cool and calm and rationalize her views. At first, she as- sented to her husband's denunciations upon the church, as worldly and timid :' upon the state, " as regulated by a set of persons not one whit better than the slave-dealers them- selves ;" but as he waxed warmer, she grew colder ; and whoen he anlounced, as the crowning climax-he had indulged rather against -the laws of rhetoric-but he was no rheto- rician, and imay be forgiven for an occasional blunder- that he would " have the church of Hymeswold free from such a sin and shame ; he would purge it from the guilt-- yes, if he stood alone, and all the world forsook them ;" then Mrs. Rogers grew really alarmed, and said: "Hush, husband, speak softly-some one may be coming in, and hear you ; and it wouldn't do for any thing in the world to have it get out." No, Joan d'Arc was not a mar- ried woman; had she had a husband, a child, and a people,  and loved them, history would have lost one of its saddest but most romantic pages. But to return from a long digression. Mr. Rogers went to the back parlor with the cloud upon his brow, which was not there when he left. The untamed child, his child too   CHE:STNUT WOOD'0.       309 and those hints at his slavery opinions before, of all persons, deacon Jones's wife, it were surely enough to ruffle a philoso- pher, much more a poor, simple, country minister. Now what was it best to do. Should he remain grave and silent, and in that fway testify his displeasure at both occurrences; or should he treat it all as a joke, and pass it by as easily as he could? Jokes did not lie in the -minister's line of events-they were always realities to him, and of the most sober kind. How much would he have given for that "faithful, right-minded, prudent wife of his." HHow quietly she would have set every thing to rights, and brought light out of darkness; but, as he passed through the entry, he heard the plash of water still going on in the kitchen, and merry laughter, extremely discordant to his troubled mind. From there, there could come no present help-he must judge for himself. Conversation was going on briskly in the sitting-room, when he opened the door. Jerry had taken his seat by Mrs. Jones, and the two were discussing something in a very animated manner; Mr. Rogers's heart misgave hini-could it be his abolitionism? Charles was walking up and down the room, apparently without taking any interest in the conversation, whatever the subject might be-and for the first time, in spite of his trouble, Mr. Rogers was struck with his personal appearance. His figure, light and flexible, was a perfect model of boyish grace. His dark hair curled in close ringlets over a singularly open and ex- Iansive forehead, and as he looked up when the minister en- tered, he thought he had never before seen so bright and speaking a face-probably lie never had. Mrs. Joles's remark was arrested midway as he entered. Jerry colored, as she stopped; it was exceedingly awkward, and so all felt. What a relief it was at this moment to hear the kitchen-door open, and then to see the smiling party  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7088-00000161"/> ,l1 O        riHESTN:IT W\OODT. that enteied. Mr. Rogers, for not the first time in his life felt inclined to bless his wife! A woman's tact! how soon it sets all the-little social jars at peace. Mrs. Rogers quickly saw that something was wrong with her husband; that Mrs. Jones was fidgety, and even Jerry discomposed; so without addressing any one of the three, she turned to Charles, and began making the most interested inquiries respecting his school, and school occu- pations. "What lhe intended to do when he became a man?"' and a variety of other questions, the answers to which sl;e scarcely heard. "I suppose! husband," she said, suddenly addressing Mr. Rogers, " you would recommend himn to be a minister?" "Yes, certainly," was his grave reply, " if the spirit of God so inclines his heart. There is no profession, young man, that can compare with it. It does not confine itself to the perishing thifngs of time-it stretches its vision away into eternity!"Mr. Rogers was now at home, and quite at his ease; he had risen, and putting himself into his pul- pit attitude, a'short sermon would inevitably have followed, had not his wife interrupted hiim. "MAy husband would be, Mrs. Jones, for having every boy that has a turn for study, go into the ministry. I heard him talking to deacon Jones about your Thonias.  eIc in- sisted Thomas was too likely a boy to be tied behind the counter; that his place was the pulpit." Tommy's education was a hobby of Mrs. Jones's, but not her husband's-so she was interested immediately; and as for Jerry, he was already playing with the little girls-only always insisting on calling lMattie "Dinah," a surname which was not soon forgotten. Fortunately for Mattie, her parents never suspected the grave offence of which she came so near being guilty. Mat- tie wisely kept it to herself: and as, in future time, she   CHESTNUT WOOD.         3" thought over the occurrence, she was sadly at a loss to tell whether it had resulted in the most pleasure or pain; ccr- tainly it bore results of which neither herself, or any others engaged in it, could have the slightest expectation at the time. So, the ties which bind together the different por- tions of our lives, are often invisible to us; yet, like the un- seen natural agencies, which silently but surely perform their allotted tasks, these form the woof around which is woven the web of our future. There was much that was light-hearted and pleasant in their drive back to Chestnut Wood, where Aunt Mary had been for some time anxiously expecting them; and even Mr. Atherton, who had set apart this last evening as one to be devoted to a long conversation with Charles, had been several times to the hall-door to see if he could not catch the sound of coming wheels. As soon as they came, he called Charles to the library, and the closed door excluded any other inmates.  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7088-00000162"/> CHAPTER XVII. WIE confess it is exceedingly against our notions of good breeding to listen, where the wish has been so openly ex- pressed of having no third person; but Charles Wallace is an undoubted favorite of ours; and we cannot altogether di- vest ourselves of uneasiness at having this young son of genius, just at this period of his life, when all impressions received, particularly those of a moral character, are apt to be lasting, and when the attendant circumstances are such as to give double weight to what is said, shut up for a close and earnest conversation with one to whom life has long been nothing but a hard and unrelenting struggle; with a hard and unrelenting master, whose standard of moral du- ties is high and sacred, but only because his nature is noble, and disdains whatever is low or sordid; who looks forward to no future, and finds in the present only the dim, mocking ' shadows of a dream. What a guide for the ardent, aspiring, trusting boy! Perhaps it was the consciousness of this which made Mr. Atherton guard every expression with such subtle power. Perhaps it was the shield of the ever-watchful guardian, who has promised that over those He loves, " he will give his angels charge to keep them in all their ways."   HTNoT  Dj O  1      oI So far in Charles's career he had given little thought to religion or religious topics. His parents had found sufi.. cient in the every-day affairs of life to occupy their time and thoughts; and though he had early and rigorously been taught to observe the minor religious duties; never to lay his head upon a pillow, over which God's care had not been asked; and never to idle hours set apart by divine command for holy purposes; yet, this had been all and surely to the knowledge-seeking child, enough of earthly lore was prof- fered to make him think little of that wisdom, " the mer- chandise of which is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold." Thoughtful beyond his years, it was fame, of an immortal name, and not this for himself alone; another brow than his was to wear that undying chaplet-the leaves of the laurel would fade and die without the sun of her love. Earth had enough for Charles! he never yet had had a wish beyond. It was a dangerous atmosphere, that of the lofty library in which he was now sitting. The low and squalid cottage -poverty-sin--shame : he would have recoiled from these naturally, as the flower droops and fades in impure air; but here, the poison was ministered in a golden chalice. If he but touches his lips to the intoxicating draught, who shall hinder it from mingling with his life-blood?" "  This is your last year at the academy, Charles!" began Mrn Atherton. "Have you made any plans for the future?" Charles did not immediately answer. Dependent as he was upon Mr. Atherton for the means of future progress, it was rather delicate to propose, or even allow, that he had formed plans; this Mr. Atherton seemed to perceive, for he said, "You understand of course that I intend you shall have every advantage that money can procure for you-and that, VOL. .--14  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7088-00000163"/> 314        CHESTNUT WOODh 3iicsT 1 Nuwt xvow. not at all as a gratuity from me. I only pay what I owe your parents ; and your father, I suppose you know, by his late discovery of Sybil, has entitled himself most fully to the reward of the five thousand dollars I offered. This, I intend hiin to have; but beside that, there is a large bill for nursing and attendance, and the only way in which I canl pay this is by paying for your educatiol: so I hope, with this conversation, all delicacy on the point will cease between us. Let me do what I can, Charles, I shall always remain the debtor. Now speak freely-what are your plans?" "To go to college, sir," said Charles, no longer hesitat- ing; " to study hard-to graduate with honor; and then to study my profession." "What profession?" "I do not know, sir. I have left that to be decided when the time came; it must depend, I suppose, very much upon my tastes and capabilities then." "They will be then, Charles, you may rest assured, ex- actly what you determine now that they shall be. The events of our lives are not left, as people are too apt to sup- pose, to be determined by circumstances; but in our own hands lies the power to fashion them as we will. A boy who decides to be a business man, has, through every hour of his boy's life, the choice of directing his thoughts in just those channels which shall mature his judgmenrt, make his faculties sharp and quick, and when the hour comes give him a start in life which shall soon place him far before 1thoso wh have blundered on, neither thinking, knowing, lo caring about the future. So, with any of the professions. If the choice is made early, the whole course of study, in- stead of being general and desultory, can be pursued as means to an end. Just those books can be most thoroughly learned which will put a weapon into the hand. College years, instead of being wasted as they are often now, might be-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         315 come the most important period in a young man's life. They should be to him what our military schools are to the young soldiers, a place for drilling and discipline. These are en- tered with a definite object-and only one object. Every hour, every day, and every year is expected to advance this; llId he who lies idle upon his arms, who is remiss even in the slightest particular, is considered unfit for the life he has chosen, and dismissed to seek another. But a steady purpose, a continued and persevering attention to the one thing, and when the disciplinary life is over a post of honor and of trust is awaiting him, a post which he is amply quali- fled to fill. So with a profession. There are many more places of honor and trust in our country, than men to fill them. For the most part, it is not until the hair begins to grow gray, the vigor of the mind to wane, that a man is dis- ciplined sufficiently to take and fill the place which his na- tural powers would have made his years ago ; and then, m hat remains to him: the noon is over, the shadows are stretch- ing themselves longer and longer before him-he hardly hears how great he is, before there comes to him stealthy whispers, ' His age begins to show itself. Behold the dead lion!' A wasted morning, a late, busy noon, and an early twilight-such is the history of life!" Mr. Atherton paused, but the thoughts were new to Charles-he was revolving them in his mind, and had no answer to make; so after a few moments' silence, Mr. Atli- erton continued: On the contrary, there, is the busy morning, when the mind is fresh and active, when he works with its might and with singleness of arm; the present is provided for, and is, in its turn, to provide for the future: then comes that fu- ture-the boy has vanished, and the man, ready armed, marches forth with brave heart to do battle. Year after year in that quiet, early life, he has been forging his mail-  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7088-00000164"/> 316        ciM:sTNUTr WOO). not a vulnerable point remains. He has proved it, and strengthened it; he knows its worth, and when hard upon it come the blows of the thick strife, his heart within it beats on as quietly and as calmly as if the victory were already his own. Then, old age brings repose-the repose of the chieftain, with the laurel on his brow, the rest of the con- queror: and when earthly sounds are failing the deafened car, and earthly honors are a burden, like the grasshopper, then hold on life falls off so gently; no regret in the past; the sum of human existence is full, and like a shock of corn fully ripe, he is gathered to his rest." A And his name lives after him," said the boy, looking up with his full beaming eyes. "Yesbut what matters that to him? life is past. Can the knowledge of it reach him in the grave?" ( But he is not forgotten." ' Forgotten, boy! what does that matter? the grave is silent; no voice from this world can disturb its rest." "Bat perhaps we may know, then-" "Perhacps we may," said Mr. Atherton, interrupting him; -" but that is nothing to our purpose nowl--we were speaking of the present, not of the future. You have never thought of your profession. Professions are a hard life. Your first object will be-" 'i To make a name." Mr. Atherton smiled, and Charles scarcely liked the tone in which he said, "A very common boy's dream : but I ili- agine you will first find it necessary to make bread." "A conqueror never thinks of that, sir," answere,' Charles, not yet forgetting the somewhat florid exhortation in which Mr. Atherton had indulged. "But he must nevertheless eat and drink, must be housed and clothed, like other men, or he will as surely die from want. Name is a good thing, but many would tell you   CHESTNUT WOOD.         317 that it is oftener bought with gold than won by talent. If money is the root of all evil, it is a tree which sends forth much good fruit. Money, much more emphatically than knowledge, is power." A flush of indignation passed over Charles's face, but it only made Mr. Atherton say more de- cidedly, "Therefore, in choosing what you will be, rernem- ber the necessity of a livelihood, and show in your choice that you have good sense as well as ambition." M lIany professional men are wealthy," said Charles, hesi- tatingly. "Yes-many professional, but not many great men. It would almost seem as if to every one was to be meted out an even measure: some have it filled with one good thing, some with another, to very few are given more than this. I would advise you, situated as you are, with four brothers to help on in the world-for you will wish to do this, you are by no means a selfish boy,"-Charles's eye brightened--" to prepare yourself, as you go through college, for business. I shall be able to give you such a start as falls to the lot of very few young men. Before you are half lmy age, you may have double my property, and then leisure sufficient to fol- low out any literary plans you may have devised." A look of indecision passed over Charles's face. "To be sure," con- tinued Mr. Atherton, "you will then be too old; your hab- its of mind too stereotyped to accomplish the making of the name, which, if I understand you, is now about your only object; but you have done what will be of more solid com- fort, secured a competence, and be able to do for others as well as for yourself. Fame is a selfish good: it encircles one head, and leaves many desolate hearts." "Oh no, sir," eagerly interrupted Charles. "There can be nothing selfish in Famle; for to be great alone, would not be to be great." "What would it be?"  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7088-00000165"/> 318         CHESTNUT WOOD. "I hardly know, sir; but I feel that to be famous would be to be happy-to be satisfied-to be content; and no one could be happy, or satisfied, or content, alone; it would only be with others, andfor others, that we would be great; that they might be proud of us; might feel that we were worthy of being loved and trusted." "A boy's definition, truly :" but there was a smile upon Mr. Atherton's face, a kind, pleased smile. The boy's en- thusiasm was not an enigma to him; it was like a strain of some dear song, known and loved long ago, but forgotten amid the jarring discords of years. Softly and gently it stole into that hard heart-it was like the voice of Sybil in its winning tenderness. Charles saw the smile, but he was almost alarmed at his own daring. He had spoken to the stern, rich, proud Mr. Atherton, as he had never before to any living being. He had lain open to him one of the cherished secrets of his heart, the only secret of which he then knew himself pos- sessed-for so had his love twined and intertwined itself with the very sources of his being, that he no more recog- nized it as a separate existence than he did the beating of the heart as it sent the life-blood through his system. Yet all this he had said, and lie felt now no wish to re- tract-no desire to undo whatever impression he might have made. The conviction that he had settled a question in life grew, as Mr. Atherton's eyes were fixed intently upon him, reading his soul. He had, then, nothing to coiceal-- nothing but what he had said. He seemed to himself to have become older, more of a man; he had thrown away wealth, and chosen fame! While he was thus thinking, Mr. Atherton's face gradually lost its smile, and the old stern expression stole over it again. "Poor boy!" he said, somewhat sadly. "You are not the first dreamer, and shall not be the last: but there are   CHESTNUT WOOD.         319 yet years in which to choose. Four years from now, life will look very differently to you. We will talk again then. If you would shoot high, aim at the sun.' It is a good proverb, but it has ruined more than it has helped. It is very few who are able to estimate the strength of their arm, or the trueness of their eye. Many feebly lift the bow, and rest satisfied with the wish to strike the sun. Ambition consists more in planning, than in acting; but it is to be worked for, Charles, just as one works for any other earthly good. To be gained slowly and carefully, with watching and care and anxiety, just as cents are accumulated into dollars, and dollars into hundreds, and hundreds into thou- sands. A man never dreamed himself into fortune; a man can never any more dream himself into fame. 'By the sweat of your brow,' that is the curse-and while man exists it must be ever working its fulfilment. Industry and per- severance, they are mighty and will combat bravely with any Fate. One must make their own way in life, and, after all, it is so soon over, it does not matter much what we do." Of late, this last conclusion had been a very common one with Mr. Atherton. He had felt, since Sybil's disappear- ance, so deeply the transitiveness and uncertainty of all earthly objects of dependence and comfort, that in as far as the active, restless nature of his mind would allow, he had become indifferent, or rather he had striven to care little or nothing for what was here to-day and to-morrow was gone! But in the earnest, hopeful boy, there was no chord to vibrate in unison. His ear caught the sad strain, but it died away before it reached his heart. The voyage was all before the young mariner, and he was busy preparing for it. The vessel must be richly freighted, before he should hear with any pleasure the charmed words of "Homeward Bound." It would have been almost impossible then to have made him comprehend an existence ending with time.   Now,  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7088-00000166"/> 320         CHESTNUT WOOD. without knowing why, he felt himself softened by Mr. Ath- erton's closing words, and looking up, he said: ' I think I can promise you, sir, never to choose any profession, or adopt any course in life, which shall be dis- pleasing to you." 'C I do not doubt you, my boy," said Mr. Atherton, kindly. "Let us leave the future-and now for the present. You have only a few weeks longer, then college term com- mences. Have you chosen your Alma Mater?" a Yes, sir," and the choice was one of which Mr. Ather- ton highly approved. "You shall have a liberal allowance. Never be extrava- gant-never be mean.  Either extreme shows a want of judgment and good sense. Money is only the means to the end. Use it as such-nothing lavish, nothing grudging. It is a habit never too early acquired, that of judicious expen- diture. It is worthy trouble and thought.  Many have failed in life for no other reason than that they have con- sidered this as beneath their attention. ' he weakness lies in the neglect, not in the care. Therefore, make it early an object to be exact in your accounts; punctual in your pay- ments. Never have a debt-debts have ruined more men than any other cause. Honesty is as necessary to success in life as perseverance or industry; perhaps more so, for a young man just starting; and there is no greater dishonesty, excepting crime, which the law recognizes and treats as such, than buying what you cannot well pay for, or perhaps pay for at all. Avoid all such errors in starting in life. It will save you much time otherwise spent in regret and re- pentance. A truly honorable man will carry his honor into little money matters, as well as into the greater actions of life; indeed, that is but spurious coin which only passes cur- rent in large sums, but will not bear the test of small.

O 1 least atom, as well as when it has been tried by the refiner's fire, and molten into curious and beautiful shapes. Like most other people who have lived as many years, I would test character more by little things,--by the just and punctual payment of a penny, than by the gift, perhaps, of hundreds." During this speech, Charles had winced a little; not that he did not perfectly agree with Mr. Atherton in all he was saying, but that it recalled to him what he had for the time forgotten, the pecuniary obligation he was under. His was a proud nature, and obligation in any form was not con- sonant with his feelings: yet, in this case, he could not, without much delay, have acquired his education. He felt that he had no right'to call upon his parents for assistance, which was proffered him from other sources, and of which he could avail himself by self-sacrifice. He did not take refuge, as many of a less noble nature would have done, un- der the hope of one day returning all that he should now re- ceive. He had the true feeling that the unconditional ac- ceptance of what was so generously offered, was the only way of showing his gratitude adequate to the occasion. He quieted his love of independence by no subterfuge; he never said to himself, much less to others, "One day I will return this. I am only now borrowing. I will pay even to the in- terest." He knew that when he should be capable of earn- ing money, he should have more to do with it in the present needs than he could well supply; so, although the struggle was frequent, he always manfully fought it down, nor recog- nized, boy as he then was, in this the true heroism. "I will try, sir,' he said, meekly; " and I hope you will not think me extravagant. I am sure I do not mean to be." "I have no fear of it, Charles. You have, so fart been thoughtful beyond your years; too much so. I do not wish you to want any thing; nothing can be farther fromi my heart. I have an abundance, and but little use to make of  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7088-00000167"/> 322        CHESTNUT WOOD. it. One thing more, and that is all I have to say for the present. I have reserved this to the last, because I con- sider it the most important.'" He was silent for a moment, and Charles immediately prepared himself for some religious advice. He had never heard from Mr. Atherton any allu- sion to such subjects, but he had not doubted that he would consider them as the most important to a young man just starting in life. He was not, therefore, a little astonished, when Mr. Atherton went on to say: "I mean a rigid adherence to truth. Not simply anl- swering correctly to any direct question-but truth in its broadest and most extensive sense. There is nothing about which a person can deceive themselves and others more easily: and therefore, perhaps, a character, in order to be really truthful, must be eminently sclf-knotw. There is no doubt that many persons are actuated by motives of which they are wholly ignorant. They have an idea of what is right and proper to be done, and frequently conform the ac- tion to this standard, without any approximation to it in real feeling. They act the lie without being aware of it; and the question would be, the amount of their positive guilt, To some it would be more, to some less, according to the standard by which they had accustomed themselves to judge; to me, it would be entire and unconditional, ag- gravated by the very ignorance, which to others might be held an excuse. This is one species of falsehood: the most dangerous to the character, because the most hidden in its influences. To guard against it, one must be accustomed to critical self-inspection. Another and perhaps more common kind of untruthfulness is, pretending to motives which we know we have not. This is more barefaced, and therefore more generally condemned. It oftener betrays itself, and is more repugnant. No one will long persevere in such a course of action, if there is any thing of worth in his charac-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         323 ter. 'Be and not seem.' It has become of late almost a trite saying, but it is none the less valuable. "It is hardly necessary for me to define to you these simple things. It is only because I have regarded a ten- dency to falsehood, as oftentimes a secret and invidious ene- my to the young, and have had many opportunities of seeing the fairest prospects ruined by it, that I dwell upon it even so much at large. It is in some covert form that the vice is generally indulged; an open falsehood is so soon detected, so glaringly impolitic and ruinous, that a man must be either lost, or a coward, who ventures upon it, no matter how great the dilemma in which he may be placed." A shudder passed over Mr. Atherton's frame, which Charles remem- bered afterward, though now he scarcely heeded it-but he went on without a change of voice. "I could not, even if I. would, warn you against falsehood as you can warn yourself. Only watch. You will be surprised to see what a hydra- headed monster it is. How you but kill it in one form, and it is alive and meets' you fully armed in another. How it creeps into your minutest actions-I had almost said into your thoughts: and, Charles," there was mockery now in his tone, "I have heard it in prayers! I have heard those who said they believed in the existence of a God, and of a prayer-hearing God, approach Him, and utter false words, knowing that they came from a false heart. Fools or knaves always they have proved themselves in the end; but awful as it seems, it has been done. Rest assured, boy," and Mr. Atherton rose and placed himself in a commanding attitude before Charles, " at the basis of every thing, fame, honor, wealth, yes, even affection, must lie the firm foundation of truth, searching, bold, unflinching truth. You may rear a stately edifice without it. It may be fair to the eye, and lift itself boldly up against the sky-but it will not bear the first blast of the tempest. It will be shaken even by the  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7088-00000168"/> 324        CHESTNUT WOOD. summer breeze, and finally it shall fall from its inability to support itself. I might speak of cultivating the habits of truth, in reference to the effect which they have upon the mental training of a youth, but I wish you to be truthful from other motives than ambition. You will soon find for yourself how direct and powerful the influence of strict and careful habits will be upon your mind. How your judg- ment will be quick and certain in its operations; your mem- ory faithful, because never taxed with what it is not safe for it to remember ; your reasoning strong and persuasive, be- cause truth is powerful and must prevail. Indeed, I need not repeat these to you. I only wish to make such an im- pression upon you that-you shall feel, that first and foremost in the desirable acquisitions of your collegiate life, is a high and holy love for, and practice of, truth." "Do I not now always speak the truth?" asked Charles, wonderingly; for he could not understand why he had been thus cautioned on what appeared to him so obvious. "I hope so-at least I have never yet learned to the contrary; but it is to act the truth, as well as speak it, that I am so anxious for you. Many a man never with hil lips utters a falsehood, whose whole life is nevertheless a lie. Truth is the most difficult kind of honesty, but it is always the best policy; yet policy is a bad word for a boy to frame any actions upon. I should be sorry to have it enter into your plans. "And now, my boy, -I have read you a long lecture: when you are a man, you will feel that this, more than any thing else, has shown my interest in you. Good bye. Re- member I am in the place of a father to you, and shall watch your success with pride and pleasure." He extended his hand to Charles; for the first and last time, as the boy clasped it in both of his, he lifted it to his lips and kissed it. Mr. Atherton seemed surprised, but pleased. He turned to his   CHLESTNUT \VOOD.        325 table and opened a book, Charles understood that the inter- view was ended, and left the room. Sybil and Mattie had long ago gone to bed, and were now asleep; but Aunt Mary had been watching for him, and as he closed the library door, she called him up stairs into the school-room. It was, of all rooms in the house, his favorite: for here he had oftenest sat by Sybil's side, and here he had received from Aunt Mary's gentle lips those lessons of true wisdom which sank deeply into his heart. She was the only one who ever spoke to him on personal religion, and he had learned to associate her with whatever was happy and good in life. It was, therefore, with a quick step and beating heart that he obeyed her summons. His cheek was yet flushed, and his manner full of excitement from his conversation with Mr. Athertot. Aunt Mary thought, as she closed the door softly after him, that, excepting'Sybil's, she had never seen so beautiful a human face before. It was with pride as well as fondness that she put back the curls from his damp fore- head, and said: "Charles, I wonder if you will grow to make a vain an!" "Vain! why, Aunt Mary, what a question," answered the handsome boy; "I have heard of vain girls, and al- ways despised them, but a vain man must be unworthy even of contempt." ' And yet, Charles, you do not despise beauty?" "Despise it, Aunt Mary, how strangely you talk! I worship it; I should not love Sybil half so well, if she were not so beautiful." "Not even if she were as good, and as kind, and as amia- ble as she is now?" "No, not with all these; they are rich jewels, but the more requisite the beautiful case. It seems to me as if  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7088-00000169"/> 326        CHESTNUT WOOD. I could see her now, sitting in that chair, right opposite to me, with those long golden curls, that soft blue eye, and that slnall rosy mouth. O11h, is she not very beautiful, Aunt It was the first time Charles had- ever spoken so of Sy- bil, but he was excited, and to-night all the fountains of his soul seemed destined to overflow. Y'es, she is beautiful," answered Aunt Mary, with a pleased smile; "but not half as beautiful as she is good. Could you love her if she were only beautiful--if she were not gentle, and amiable, and kind?" "Yes, I could love -her if she were marble, and could look at me as she does sometimes." "But could you, if she were wicked?" "She never could be." ' But she might, and she does often do very wrong; could you love her then-she would still be beautiful? u"H should be very sorry to have her, Aunt Mary, for I am afraid, yes, I am almost sure, said the boy speaking very hesitatingly, "I should love her still, but I am glad it is not so. I believe I love her almost as mnuch now for be- ing good, as I do for being beautiful."' "You ought to love her a great deal more, tor there is no beauty that can compare with moral excellence. I have seen a great many persons who were very plain looking; but whom I still loved, sometimes, I think, perhaps the more, that they were so plain." "And so have I, but still I am very glad Sybil is beautiful. Do you know, Aunt Mary, I never have felt so unwilling to go away and leave her before. That dreadful kidnapping! I tremble even nosr, to think of it. It seems as if i -must be here to guard hler; no one else can do what I would." "We shall be very careful, but, after all, no one can   CHESTNUT WOOD.        327 guard her but He who is every where present. To His care we must commit her. When I am forgetful of this I am very miserable, for the more I think of it, the more' unac- countable seems the whole affair. I am at a loss for their object. " "Why, she is so beautiful," suggested Charles. "Yes, but such people care very little for that; they must have had some object to gain wholly unimaginable to me; but," said Miss Rogers, suddenly stopping, "it is now late, and I did not call you to talk with you about Sybil; I wanted, Charles, to say to-you a few words about yourself before you leave us. You will go to college before we see you again." "Yes, say on, dear Aunt Mary; I think often of what you say to me when I am away from you." "Do you, Charles? ' Then came that old pleasant smile again. "Well, ,I had much, oh much, to say to you. I have been thinking of you through the day, and somehow, althoufgh I am  really no relation to you, I have felt as if you were very near to me, and I had a certain care over you which no one else had. Not exactly like a mother, Charles, for your own is so good and kind that you do not need another, but like an elder sister. It seems to me as if I was to be very proud of you, and happy about you, one of these days; as if you were to be a great man, and a good man, a Christian, I mean, Charles-perhaps a minis- ter.:' "A minister! Aunt Mary--why, I shall never be good enough for that. A man should be very holy that preaches. No, I never shall be good enough for that." "By dear boy, God will make you so-only ask him to, only try to be good, to do what is right-only --Aunt Mary stopped, and Charles looked earnestly at her. He hlad received all lessons of worldly wisdom-he was not  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7088-00000170"/> satisfied-there remained something more yet, but the tears were in Aunt Mary's eyes, and she only said, "I cannot tell you, Charles, what I wished to; I do not know why, but I feel so inadequate, so powerless, to convey to you lmy earn- est wish for your future good. I have chosen for you a lit- fle parting gift, but it is more valuable than any thing else the world can give you. Read it often, read it thoroughly, read it remembering your immortal soul, and then you will not be ashamed nor afraid to be called a Christian, even though you are surrounded by all the temptations of a college life. God bless you, Charles." 'She slipped a Bible into his hands-then again softly opening the door, followed himl to his own room, to make whit few preparations were necessary for his early start to-morrow morning. The boy looked on quietly. In Aunt Mary's few words there was something which had-sank deeper into his heart than in all the exhor- tations he had received from Mr. Atherton; and the last thing upon which his thoughts were fixed, as he passed the dividing line between sleeping and waking, was Aunt Mary's plan for his becoming a minister. The next morning came very quickly. He was wakened by a knock upon his door. It was John, to say, "It was time to start, if they expected to reach Hymeswold in sea- son for the Charlton stage." Charles promised to be down in a moment, and many times as he hurried through his toi- let, thanked Aunt Mary for her thoughtful care the night before, which now enabled him to be so soon ready.  He heard the carriage drive around to the front door-and stealing down that he might not awaken any of the family, he stopped a moment, only one, by the school-room door, and another by Sybil's. He wished he could see her to say "good-bye." He was sure it would be easier to go if he could. All was still there. He was disappointed. He had, almost unknown to himself, hoped the noise of the car-   riage would waken her, and she would rise, if only for one word; but there was not a sound, so he passed on down the stairs. - The house seemed still and desolate--he lad never known it so but once before-that was when Sybil lay, as they feared, dying. The old clock uttered the same loud clear tick that it had then. It smote the boy's ear with a startling sound. Suddenly it occurred to him that it was knelling away the last moments of his boyhood life and he should leave the house of man  ! Awe-struck, he lingrcred on the threshold--the slow moving hand was on the stroke of five. One-two-three-four-five-the last vi- bration died away, and Charles started as from a dream. Childhood lay behind him-and before, in that illimitable fiuture, stretched out mlanhood-vast, vague, and confused. He stood in the gray light of morning, trembling and uncer- tain upon  the door-steps-he saw the mnist slowly  rising around him--he heard the dimi distant sounds of waking na- ture. There  was something in its uncertainty in unison with his newly-awaklened feelings; he hardly noticed the large carriage that stood with the inpatient horses  waiting, but mechanically placing his foot upon the steps, began slowly to aseend. "Iave o0t you waked up yet, Charlie?"  said the soft ringing voie of Sybil. He started--Sybil, Mattie, Aunt Mary, and Jerry were all sitting there, watching the wavering, dreamy motions of the boy as le came out. "Well done   for 't," exclaimed Jerry, without giving in time even for an exclamation of surprise;  " if the horses ain't no wider awake thlan you are, you won't never see ChardI- ton to-night- I[in sartain of that." But  Charles was in his scat with the happy party, over whom the prospect of separation had no terror. The pres- ent it is all in our opening lives, and it is well for us that   &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7088-00000171"/> 330         CHESTNUT WOOD. it is And so the drive to Hymeswold was quickly past, and being in ample season for the stage, they waited until they saw Charles on his favorite seat by the driver, and mid a cloud of dust waved their adieu. Just then' the mists and gray light of morning fled away before the bright beams of the rising sun, and so with its glorious promising light full upon him, Charles bade adieu to boyhood and Chest- nut Wood. i-   CHAPTER XIX. THE flight of years had been of late a thing almost unno- ticed and uncared for by Mr. Atherton. It had only marked the completion of the property which he had the sense to feel was a competency; the leaving of city habits and city life, and the erection of his beautiful country-seat of Chest- nut Wood.   There was nothing specially to remind him of the passage of time. His hair had long since been silvered -his step was as firm, his eye as bright, his senses all as acute as- twenty years ago. He was passing on, unheeding, when Sybil came into the desolate house, and then suddenly life began anew; and days, and weeks, and years were meted out, as they changed the child into the girl, and the girl into the budding woman. Each summer -brought with it roses nnd its sweet genial influences, new charms to Sybil. Each winter garnered up treasures of knowledge, and gentle, beau- tiful womanhood-and so Mr. Atherton found himself, as it were, standing still, and under his shadow the delicate bud unfolding to the perfect flower.! The two children had reached the age of sixteen, and yet both preserved in a remarkable manner the characteris- ties which were conspicuous at six. Aunt Mary's perse- vering efforts had done much more than she had dared to  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7088-00000172"/> 332        CHESTNUT WOOD, anticipate toward developing mind in Mattie, She was as ardent, impulsive, and thoughtless as ever, but could ap- ply herself and could accomplish, though she did it with re- luctance, and often had recourse to stratagem to avoid it. With equal pains bestowed upon her education, she had ac- quired a very inferior one to Sybil. Indeed, sometimes the contrast between them was so great, as to have been humil- iating and discouraging to one less volatile and affectionate than Mattie; but a failure passed away from her mind as quickly as would have a fruitless chase after a butterfly; and she loved Sybil so dearly that she seemed to take more pleas- ure in seeing her do well, and in hearing her praised, than she would have in receiving the same approbation for her- self. But she had much more physical life than Sybil, and conduced more to the general happiness and amusement of the house. No one loved her so well, but all missed her more; even Mr. Atherton, grave and quiet as he was, in- quired for her, if she were longer than usual at the parson- age, and was always glad wheln le heard her merry voice again in the house. Sybil glided about so noiselessly, laughed so softly, when she laughed at all, that but for the clear ring of the silver voice, you would hardly have known that she was near you, and yet, when she was, you were al- Ways conscious of it. You would first have sought Mattie, if you had a heart full of fun and frolic-but you would have sat down by Sybil, if you had been sad, and one glance from her deep eyes would. have comforted you, and so they had grown to be almost young women. Both striking, both beautiful; one the flashing beauty of the sun--the other the quiet, gen- tle loveliness of the moon; and as Mr. Atherton saw them moving about, and marked from month to month the rapid changes, lie became more and more, though very reluctantly   CHESTNUT VOO D.        3333 convinced that they must have opportunities given them for acquiring accomplishments, as well as the more solid educa- tion Miss Rogers had been so capable of imparting to them. He slowly matured his plans, and then, after a long con- sultation with Aunt Mary, proceeded to carry them into ex- ecution. He had at first wished very much to remain at Chestnut 'Wood, but the impossibility of procuring suitable teachers as frequently as he would wish lessons given, made him de- termine to remove for a short time to the city, leaving to Jerry the care of every thing at Chestnut Wood. He would take a house, perhaps the same one he used to occupy, and the girls, although too young for society, should have, for a time at least, every advantage which the city could offer. Before any thing was said to Sybil and Mattie, Aunt Mary undertook to obtain the consent of the minister and his wife to Mattie's accompanying them. She expected to have much trouble in persuading them that it was best; for they had already expressed the wish. as Mattie had grown quite into a young lady, that she should return and live at home. They were beginning to feel, as the vigor of life died away, that they could not do without her much longer. They wanted to hear young vigorous movements about the house. "A merry heart would do them both good, as does a medicine," said Mrs. Rogers often, as through the long evenings they sat looking at each other, and waiting to hear the bell ring the good old retiring hour of nine. It required now a great deal of affection for their child, a constant reminding themselves, that they should but stald in the way of her future good, to allow her to remain longer at Chestnut Wood. This they had often hinted to Aunt Mary, but only hinted, and Aunt Mary was very dull, and unable ever to understand them. She had, however, gath- ered enough to make her feel very doubtful as to the man-  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7088-00000173"/> 334        (CHESTNUT WLOOD. ner in which they would receive this proposition, and she told Mr. Atherton honestly her doubts before she went to make the application. Mr. Atherton seemed annoyed, but of course it was a thing over .which he had but little control, and he nlust leave it entirely to Miss Rogers, though once he had quite an idea of calling Jerry in to his help. He had learnedl to depend mnuch upon Jerry's Yankee wit and cleverness-; in- deed, he was frequently amused at himself, to see what a ne- cessity Jerry had become to him. BIiss Rogers chose her time with much care for the pre- sentation of her plan at the parsonage. She went twice there for the purpose, but finding the domestic sky rather clouded, had returned without even broaching the subject. Mr. Atherton was in no immediate haste, so he made no in- quiries, and she conducted her little generalship in a manner entirely to suit herself. It made her quite a frequent vis- itor to her brother's, but she was always a welcome one. At last all things seemed propitious, and she ventured upon the proposal. It was received as she had anticipated. Mrs. Rogers grew first very red, then very white, then bursting into a flood of tears, said, with choking words: "Husband, I can't; anyhow in the world, I can't." Mr. Rogers was walking with his nervous step up and down the room. He looked excited, but more by his wife's tears than-by the proposition. Often and readily as he had seen them for the last twenty-five years, he could not become accustomed to them; they made him just as agitated and anxious now as they did when he first saw them, on the morning when the very small village, henceforward to bo her home, came in sight of the bride; so now he only con- tinued walking up and down, without making any effort to comfort her.. She was the first to interrupt herself. Aunt Mary was far too wise to have ventured to do so.   CHESTNUT WOOD.         335 ' There-what a fool I am!" she said; " just as if she must go, whetherwe. want to have her or not; of course she is our own child, and if we have given her up so long, it has only been for her good, not ours. Go to the city, to New- York, where we could only see her once a year, and perhaps not that! Why, we might as well give the darling clihld away at once."  Here fresh tears interrupted her, and Aunt Mary took the opportunity to say, soothingly: a Mr. Atherton says she may come down every month and spend the Sabbath with you, or even oftener, if you wish it."  "But the expense, wife, the expense," interrupted Mr. Rogers; "only think of that; it would be. wrong to want to see her often." "Wrong!" answered the mothler, almost angrily, tem- per chasing away the tears sooner than any words of comfort would; " wrong-how am I to help wanting to see my own and only child?  You her father, and talk to me about its being wrong--what will come next?" "Why, wife, I  only meant," said Mr. Rogers, in a most deprecatory tone of voice, " that if you let her go, you must make up your mind not th be expecting her to come home as often as she does now. I am sure it is most kind, and thoughtful, and generous, and I wish I could say ChrAisSiant- but that I  can't, as he don't come to church--in Mr. Ather- ton, to make such an offer; only think of it, wife: to pay all her expenses, and give her these advantages. The Lord is certainly very gracious to us--much, very much, beyond our deserts." "And that is the trouble, husband."   lMrs. Rogers's tone was gentler now. "If it were not such a marked Pro- vidence, it would be easy enough to know what to do; but this whole thing, from  Mattie's first going to (Chestnut  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7088-00000174"/> 336         CHESTNUT WOOD, Wood, is so marked, that somehow it seems like flying in the face of God not to do what his finger points out." Mrs. Rogers spoke honestly. So far the struggle had been between her grief at parting with Mattie, and her fear  of, as ,she said, A' flying in the face of God."' She was a firm a believer in the whole system of Divine agencyt; she believed  that He not only regulates the greater spiritual affairs of our lives, but that He has counted the hairs of our Leads, and not even the wing of a sparrow casts its shadow over our daily path but its flight is guided by His hand, and is work- ing out those purposes hidden from the creation of the world; therefore, when she came upon deciding a question in life, she set herself most diligently to watch the signs which might interpret His will, and in this way, much oftener, it must be o confessed, hedged herself in with doubts and confusions, than if she had followed the clear and oftener unerring council of a ready judgment. Aunt Mary knew her well enough to be certain that if she once convinced herself that this visit to ; New-York was not of human plan alone, Mattie would cer- tainly go with them ; therefore she only said: "It is very unusual for one who is not a relation, and froum whom we have no right to expect a favor, as he is not even one of the people, to come forward and of his own accord make so generous an offer. It seems to me the reason should !s be a very good one, for Mattie's sake, which makes us de- cline it." l "If you were not going, sIary, then of course the way   would be perfectly plain and open."' "But I amn, and so that docsn't help us, as I can see,"' said Aunt Mary, smiling. "Don't smile, Mary! I declare I feel as solemn as the grave. Husband!-what ought we to do?   I want to do what is right, and only that." "I think you had better let her go," said the father, in a   CHESTNUT WOOD.         337 husky voice.  "It seems to me a clear, and, as Mary says, rather a remarkable indication of Providence for our child." 'Dear-dear me!"Then came a fresh burst of tears. ' Hlow can Hhow wicked I am, to fly in the face of a plain duty; I shall certainly cry myself sick over it." And so one would have thought to have seen her, for hier great frame shook convulsively, as if really under the weight of some heavy calamity. ";Well, sister," said Aunt AIary, '" don't cry any more about it now, or you certainly will be sick. You can have until to-morrow to tlink it over, or until next week, if you- wish.  Mr. Atherton is in no special hurry, and then brother can come over to Chestnut Wood and let'us know." '"That wouldn't be quite civil, wife; you had better de- cide at once, one w;lay or another.

Aunt Mary went gladly; she had obtained what she had hardly dared to hope for, and she hastened to impart her good fortune to Mr. Atherton, and then, with hs consent, to the girls themselves. Mattie was, as might have been expected, quite wild with joy. She danced about the room, ran to the piano, began to play, "When Mary to," as her mother called the sacred melody, then suddenly stopping, declared she was very tired of playing that same thing over and over, and it would be delightful to be able to have a choice at least. She asked questions and answered them so fast that Aunt Mary had no opportunity, and then, for the first time, noticing that Sybil did wt seem quite as delighted as herself, she looked wonderingly at her, and asked, " if she were not glad to go?" "No-very, very sorry," was Sybil's ready answer.  Aunt Malry was disappointed'; she knew Sybil's love for music and for tie fine pictures with which the house was filled, and she had often mourned her own inability to im- part what she felt the child's natural tastes demanded, so : she said now, scarcely less gravely than Sybil herself: "Why, Sybil, I thought nothing could please you better; you are now 'most sixteenl, and all you know of music is what little you were taught when you were very young, and the accompaniments you have made for yourself. A fine master  would soon give you the power of improving yourself, and of laying up a rich store of pleasure for your friends. Only  think of the hours you might amuse your grandfather when he grows older and cannot amuse himself." "But, dear Aunt Mary, why cannot I learn here? If you only knew how I dread New-York--how much I have suffered there-how every time I go out, or look out of the   CHESTNUT WOOD.         339 window, I should be so afraid of seeing some of those wicked people, or that perhaps they might steal me again, and I should never come back to you. Do, Aunt Mary, beg my grandfather not to go; let us, stay here in this beautiful holle.  But Aunt had thought very anxiously over all this ground before, and so had Mr. Atherton, and the conclusion of both was, that so many years had elapsed, and Sybil had now grown almost into a woman, they should be per- fectly fiee from any danger or annoyance from the same source. It very seldom happens that a gang of criminals keep long together, and the inability to discover any trace of these at the time search was made for Sybil, added much to their hope of permanent relief from their machinations. Mr. Atherton and Aunt Mary certainly had reasonecdhem- selves into the belief that there was not the slightest danger in going, and therefore could the more easily remove the fears of Sybil. But it was many weeks before she could hear it spoken of without turning pale and trembling. Perhaps no one appreciated as well as Sybil to what she had formerly been exposed. No one certainly could ever know the mortal terror which, once felt, can never be for- gotten. How sadly and quickly she changed; all her spir- its seemed to have left her. She wandered around the house, listless and restless; she was pale and silent, and was seen haunting her favorite walks alone, or with only Neptune, sadly, as some departed spirit might be imagined to return, and revisit the scenes where it had lived and loved on earth. She went often to the pond, and often to old Dinah's. She seemed happiest when with the still infirm negro, reading to her, or listening while she herself repeated her favorite verses from the Bible. It was a beautiful sight to see her, with her earnest, lovely face, sitting on her little footstool, close by old Dinah, her curls tossed back from her face, her rosy  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7088-00000176"/> 340         CHESTNUT WOOD. lips partly open, and that ".precious book " before her, while the negro, with her time-worn face, sat bent forward in her old arm-chair, and her dim eye brightened, and a light, not of earth, stole over her fading senses. At these times Sybil seemed to her an angel, and already, to the vivid imagina- tion-the last faculty which ever leaves the negro-she was in that holy place where angel's voices alone declare the will of God. "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of Heaven, having the everlasting gospel," she said often, in a low voice, as Sybil read. Sybil did not know what she meant, and frequently asked, but never received, a coherent answer. Old Dinah could not have told her if she would; nor would she, still lmore, have had her know how, in the  separation which was before them, she could not convince her old heart but that, in some mysterious way, " one of the great pearl gates was to be closed to that heavenly city, and she was to go no more out and in,7' until Sybil should return to Chestnut Wood. Dinah hardly knew herself how much of Heaven there was to her in the young girl. Several times, Mr. Atherton had almost determined to  give up his plan of going to New-York, so unpleasantly had it affected SyLil, and her good and happiness were entirely the motives which had prompted him; but nothing was more  difficult to him than to change his mind. H-e came to a con- elusion so slowly and carefully that usually every objection had had its due weight before, and there was little occasion i to change; but in this case he could not estimate the fear and shrinking which Sybil evinced, and had there been one pleading word from her, he would have sent for teachers to ! Chestnut Wood, and done the best that he- could, under the i circumstances; but from the first, excepting the brief re- quest and fear which she had expressed to Aunlt Mary, Sybil had never asked to remain where they were  If she ] ZJd  f [e   I CHESTNUT WOOD.       341 been tempted to, she had always been withheld by the re- membrance of how much happiness, Aunt Mary said, she  might acquire the power of giving to others, especially to her  grandfather, and her good sense told her that they ought to be the best judges of her safety, even though she shrank f'rom the city with such nervous dread. Aunllt Mary vished to hurry preparations as much as pos- sible. She was sure it would be better for Sybil to be free from the dread of going, which now so much annoyed her, and she said often to Mr. Atherton "that if, when once there, they found Sybil's health and spirits did not rally, she thought it would be best to return, for certainly no advan- tages could compare with health; " at the same time she saw such arrangements as Mr. Atherton intended to make would not allow of being changed, for any but a sufficient reason. Still she did not hesitate, as much as Mr. Atherton, on the propriety of going; she only urged that it should be done at once; so, soon after Charles had joined the Freshman class at college, the house at Chestnut Wood was closed,: and the family had removed, for one year at least, to the city of New-York. Every thing there was left under the care of Jerry- even to old Dinah, who was provided with a good nurse, and all the comforts which could be imagined. Nep, of course; was one of the family, and must go; so must Mrs. Giles, so must Maggy, although Mrs. Giles said often she " could find a hundred superior girls in the city;"Maggy had better go out to service in Hymeswold; but of this Sybil would not for a moment hear. If one went, all must go; she even asked for the old tortoiseshell cat, and expressed much unwillingness to leave a living thing that she had loved. Mr. Atherton had been unable to hire the house in which he had formerly resided. He  had then done so much to  &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7088-00000177"/> CHESTN UT .WOOD- make it not only comfortable, but elegant, that the occupant now would not have parted with it for much more than he had paid when he purchased, so Mr. Atherton was obliged to hire a new, but very convenient and tasteful house, in the upper part of the city. Here he removed, the pictures and some furniture from Chestnut Wood, fitting up the rest of the house with very little thought or care for the expense, only so it made holme pleasant to the sad heart of Sybil. For the first two or three weeks she evinced much fear, never went out without holding tightly her grandfather's or Aunt Mary's arm, and keeping, Nep close to her on the other side. She bent her eyes upon the ground, and raised them only for a moment to see whatever was pointed out to her; but by degrees, as she met nothing unpleasant, or likely in any way to recall the past, her spirits and color returned, and -with these her courage. She ventured to go with Mattie and Nep, and though at first never far fronm home, yet in time she began to yield to Mattie's anxious entreaties that she would accompany her to see the new sights, without troubling those who were older and less curious; and so she grew every day less and less fearful, and before they had been three months in the city, would have gone alone, even with- out Nep; but this he would never allow, always being on the alert, and if threatened with being left at home, testify- ing his grief with such pitiful cries that Sybil's heart could never hear them unmoved; therefore Nep always went, and Sybil began to be noticed in the part of the city where she resided, not only for her uncommon beauty and grace, but for the noble dog, who was her constant companion, and who, with his broad gold collar, and proud step, looked like some prince, who had chosen this disguise, in order to be always near the lady of his love. Her home occupations also helped to bring about this happy state of things, by completely occupying her time and   thoughts. She did not know how great the gift had been whenl she was given the love of music. She had, from a child, been charmed with all the melody of sound, and the only remembrance which she retained, with any vividness, of her mother, was of her holding her in her lap, and singing to her a soft, sad air, which she could still repeat. But now music as a science was unfolded to her, and she studied it with all the delight of an ardent worshipper. For the first time in her life, Mattie, however, was able fairly to compete with her; she, too, loved music-loved it as she did every thing, with her whole soul, and her devotion to it opened a new page in her character to her astonished Aunt Mary. Early and late, with a perseverance worthy of its object, she was constantly practising, and a note from Aunt Mary to her mother, at the end of the first month, gave her a certain promise of some day hearing Mattie play even Ascension. But Mattie had no taste for drawing or painting. By dint of much perseverance she finished several large mono-chro- mate pieces, all of which were duly framed by Mr. Ather- ton, and forwarded to ornament the parlor walls of the par- sonage at Hymeswold. No gift of a Rubens, an Angelo, or even a Raphael, would have been half so welcome. Mrs. Rogers went in to look at them at least fifty times a day, and a knock at any outer door was a signal for opening that into the parlor, so that, without seeming to be ostentatious, Mrs. Rogers might yet have the pleasure of showing "' the people" how very talented Mattie was--what exquisite pieces of drawing or painting, or she hardly knew what to call them, she could execute. Her mother's pride had already silenced the murmurs of her mother's heart. "Only to think, husjband," she would say, " how near we came to losing all these, and Ascension too; but how shall we ever buy her a piano?"' How, indeed!-never before &#xD;<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7088-00000178"/> 344        CHESTNUT WOOD. was one saved out of so slender means; but then there was Ascension, and it qmzust be done. Sybil's genius proved more general. She loved pictures, as visible embodiments of the beautiful; they were to her of more value than music, because that passed away with the momlent, but this remained. Her first touches were those of an artist; she succeeded because there was soul in her pencil. If after circumstances had allowed the full de- velopment of her powers, she " would have left a name of which any country might be proud," so, at least, said her teacher. Mr. Atherton allowed no opportunity of hearing a cele- brated musician, or of seeing a fine picture, to pass unap- preciated; and at the close of, the first six months, he was so much pleased by the progress which his pupils were mak- ing, that he suggested to Aunt Mary the plan, when the year should be past, of spending the next abroad. "Abroad!"  Aunt Mary could not forbear a smile, for she thought how the word would strike the ears of Mrs. Rogers; but she only replied, "Perhaps it might be best. It really was wonderful how speedily the girls had improved; she thought they already sang as sweetly as some who made much more pretension." Many of Mr. Atherton's old business friends had sought him out, but he showed no desire to enter into society. The girls were too young, and Aunt Mary too much absorbed by them to care for any thing else. A few ladies called, and sent their daughters to see Sybil and Mattie, but the calls were never returned, and, so far as society was concerned, the family lived much more by themselves than they did at Chestnut Wood. Mattie had been several times home, and Mr. Atherton had gone with her to look a little after affairs at Chestnut Wood, but every thing went on as regularly and as faith-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         345 fully as when, he himself was there. Not even the broad gravelled walks, or the smooth cutting of the velvet lawn, were neglected; the conservatory and garden were full of flowers. It was always difficult for Mr. Atherton to return again to the noise and bustle of the city; Chestnut Wood be- came yearly more beautiful and more dear to him. Jerry had grown in conscious dignity and importance since he had become the temporary master of so fine a place, until there was quite a change in the manners of the in. habitants of Hymeswold towards him. He was no longer "Jerry," or even "Jerry Goldsmith," but "Mr. Goldsmith," worthy a bow from the greatest man of the town, and very often receiving a smile from some of its fairest ladies. He had long since given up " jobbing about," as he called it, and though at times, when hard pressed, he felt himself most sadly inclined to fall back into some of his old habits of vera- city, he manfully withstood the temptation, and in the face of consequences, not always the most pleasant, in a very awkward sort of a way, as a man generally does when at- tempting to get the better of a bad habit, which had become almost second nature,' bolted out the unvarnished truth- literally bolted it out, for it came hard, as a rusty iron bolt to which much force must be applied to start it from its place, but which, when once moved, remains cold and firm. Miss Palmy Fitch flourished also under the shadow of Jerry's greatness. She had been several times to Chestnut Wood to investigate with her little sharp, needle eyes, the state of the dust and cobwebs there, and had called at Dinah's cottage to make sure she had, in Jerry's language, "all them gimcracks, you women think so much on, and we men don't know nothing about." Jerry had once fairly in- veigled her into writing to Aunt Mary for a bright new dress, in which Dinah might be attired, to keep the anniver- sary of her wedding day, forgetting entirely, in his anxiety VOL.

The-letter, however, was written, and one morning, not a little to her surprise, Aunt Mary received the fol- lowing :- HYMESWOLD, May 7 th. '"DEAR MSs ROGERS, "I make no doubt you will be much surprised when you see these few lines from me. I should think you would be, for I am no scribe, and my letters somehow, run all sorts of ways. I am sure if I should put such stitches into my work, I should never be paid for them ; but I don't expect any pay for this, at least not any for myself. I am writing, be- cause Mr. Goldsmith says, ' his words would scare you, they are such terrible looking things,' and he wants you to know that Mrs. Dinall Lov6joy was married just fifty years ago, next 6th of June, and as it is an occasion to which she must ever look with most peculiar feelings, he thought, and so did I, that you might like to make her a present of a new gown, to wear on that day. We mean to go down, a few of us ladies, and spend the afternoon with her. Mrs. Rogers is going too, and says we will commence the exercises with a prayer-meeting by the sisters, and then towards dusk, or towards the time when it would be early candle-lighting, if it were not in June, the brethren may come in, and we will partake of some refreshment, which we will carry with us- making no doubt, however, that Mrs. Lovejoy will prefer the spiritual to the temporal food. ': We should be very happy to see you and Miss Sybil Thornton, and Miss Matilda Rogers there too, if you could make it convenient to attend, and presume Mrs. Lovejoy %would also. "Mr. Goldsmith sends his best complinlelts and highest   CHESTNUT WOOD.         347 regards, and says, ' Things is going on tolerable at Chestnut Wood,' and I send mine also, and now ' My pen is poor--my ink is pale, AMy love to you shall never fail.' "P. FITCH." "P. S.--Excuse all mistakes. Mr. and Mrs. Rogers are well. Mr. Rogers preached an excellent sermon last Sab- bath, from the text, ' Ask and it shall be given you.' "P. F.1" How much effort this communication had cost Miss Palmy! How she had refused to make two pairs of pants, that she might have time, and looked every word, from be- ginning to end, out in the Dictionary, that they might be sure to be spelt right, and when, at Jerry's suggestion, she ended with the line of poetry, how much pride and pleasure she felt, as she handed the little pinched characters which she had used for letters for him to praise. Warmly he did praise them, too.  Miss Palmy rose many degrees in his estimation, and he actually found him- self thinking, as he whistled up to bed, that if she were only twenty years younger, what with the house and barn, and little bit of garden, together with the money which she more than once had hinted she had 'hidden away in a very safe place, it would not be so bad a thing-for he could go just the same to Chestnut Wood-if there should be a legal transfer of property from her hands to his; and then imme- diately Palmy, all attenuated and sharpened down as she wasj came before him, and half amused, half vexed, he fell asleep. Ho put the letter into the post-office, and then sent many anxious thoughts after it. There was something wonderful to him in this cabalistic intercourse; it had a touch of the supernatural.  He could 'read well-knew too much of arith-  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7088-00000180"/> 348        CHESTNUT WOOD. metic ever to get cheated in accounts-but writing had al- ways been an accomplishment beyond his reach. It will hardly surprise any one but Jerry that it was so, for the jar- gon which he used for language, though easily comprehended, could certainly not have been found in the Dictionary to which Miss Palmy had recourse. But Jerry was so unused to being foiled in any thing he really wished to accomplish, that it had led him to look upon the power of writing as a great and peculiar gift, and a letter neatly finished as an ac- complishment of which the proudest might well be proud. He therefore expected great results from this letter of Miss Palmy's, and went regularly to the post-office every day to see if an answer had not yet come. In the course of a fort- night he received a letter, post-marked New-York, with which he hurried immediately home, and rushed into the house, so much excited, that Miss Palmy said " she did not get over it all day; her nerves were full of little trembles." Aunt Mary's handwriting was fine and delicate. Miss Palmy, after making several attempts to read it, and changing her spectacles for those she never used, excepting to make her finest button-holes, was obliged to declare "she could not make out one word of it." . What a dilemma! Jerry could read a large, bold hand, by taking his time and spelling out each word, but, all-impatient as he was, to stop to find out those curious little letters-it would be impossible. "Can't you make out nothing, Miss Palmy?" said Jerry, in a most imploring tone, " not even enough to find out about that 'ere gown? I am most dying to know."  Palmy rubbed her spectacles over and over again. It was no use; those delicate hair lines of Aunt Mary, so per- fectly finished, might as well have been hieroglyphics, for all that they could make of them. What was to be done? A bright thought suddenly occurred to Jerry. He would take it to Mrs. Rogers; she would read it quickly enough; but   CHESTNUT WOOD.        349 Palmy pursed up her little mouth, and tossing her head, said: "It was a new time of day, if at her period of life, and with all her accomplishments, she should have to take a let- ter directed to herself to any body else to read. She would burn it up first-that she would.7" "La, now! Miss Palmy," said Jerry, with one of his most good-natured laughs, " you couldn't be for s'posing, could you, that I would let 'un know but what you had read it a hundred times, and I had heard it just as many. I meant to carry it off-and kind of pretend, you know, that I only brought it for the sake of letting them read it, cause I thought they might like to hear." Jerry's conscience gave him a twinge, but not a very hard one, or if it did, he was just then too busy to attend to it, particularly as he saw the cloud disappearing and the sun about to shine out again on Miss Palmy's face. She said, hesitatingly, ' It does seem a pity we shouldn't know what to depend upon about Dinah's new gown. I wish Miss Rogers would write a decent hand, like a person who has had some educa- tion. She must be full as old as I am, or a little older (Miss Rogers wanted yet full fifteen years of Miss Palmy's age), and must have had spectacles with double glasses to have made out all them little marks; but take it, Jerry, and don't stop to make much talk afterwards. Mrs. Rogers is a great hand for last words, you know." I'll be back before you know it," said Jerry, seizing the letter and making for the door; but just after he had shut it he opened it again, and putting in his head, said: "I say, Miss Palmy, don't get to fretting if any thing should keep me longer than you expect, 'cause there is no telling but they may have some one in, or something may happen; only don't get in a fret about it, I'll sartainly be back."  &#xD;<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC7088-00000181"/> 350        CHESTNUT WOOD. "I've no notion of fretting," answered Miss Palmy, in a voice which certainly showed the ability to do so whenever she saw fit; but Jerry was gone again, and there was not even a child to scold if she had fancied. So for want of any other outlet, she tried to think all manner of hard things about Aunt Mary, for what she had so kindly intended should give much pleasure to her; but unjust as her feelings were now, they all disappeared when Jerry returned to com- municate the news. "I can read it to you myself, Miss Palmy," he said, throwing down his cap. "Just hear it." Palmy was all attention, as Jerry began: "My dear Miss Palmy. No it ain't neither, its Fitch- my dear Miss Fitch. "I am terribly obleged to you for that are smart letter of yourn. It was writ beautifully-no lawyer could have done it better. "It seemed very pleasant to hear about you, and Jerry, and Dinah. I think you are the benevolenltest woman in the world, to think about Dinah's gown. She shall sartain have as smart a one as is to be found for her in all York, and what is the best on't, Mr. Atherton says we may all come home for a few days to Chestnut Wood, and join your tea-party; but don't tell Dinah, nor Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, nor none of them folks in Hymeswold. We kind of want to surprise them, you know. "Yours, with many thanks, and much loving affection, "MARY ROGERS." ' P. S.-My best love to Jerry. Tell him to be at the Rising Sun with the carriage and them gray colts on the night of the fourth, as Maggy will come down to open and air the house a few days before us; and don't forget that this ere is all a secret 'twixt you, Jerry, and ( "MARY ROGERS.'   CHESTNUT WOOD.        351 Miss Fitch's face had undergone all manner of changes during this perusal of the letter. Any surprise as to the diction of the note was wholly lost in chagrin and mortifi- cation at the untoward manner in which the secret had been revealed. She was a pitiable picture of surprise and dis- may when Jerry, having finished reading it, very much to his own satisfaction at least, folded it up, and handed it to her. "Well,7l he said, in a slow tone, which showed he had taken time to meet the emergency like a man on his return home-" well, I've been in worse fixes than this afore, so far as letting the cat out of the bag is concerned. The worst on't is, it has, between you women, led me into such a pack of lies that I am afraid I shall never get out. When Mrs. Rogers read that part to me about not telling on't, I say for it, but I knocked my cap clean off my head afore I thought what I was doing; and then, when she looked up, and saw that I was astonished like, I said, "'Now you see, Mrs. Rogers, I feel kind of uneasy. I thought you would be so glad to hear, I couldn't help coming to tell you; and if your sister should get mad at me, I'm fixed, that's all.' So Mrs. Rogers laughed right out a great loud laugh, and said: "' She wont get mad, Jerry. Miss Rogers is too good- natured for that; -and I am sure I am very thankful to you, and Miss Palmy, too, for letting me know.' "Then says H,I couldn't help it, you know, but it was a lie, arter all; says I, ' Miss Palmy dont know a word about my bringing it here. She is as tight as a vice, and not a letter of the whole will you get out of her (that was true, you know, Miss Palmy), so I would be much obleged to you, Mrs. Rogers, and Mr. Rogers, too, if you wouldn't tell to nobody that you know nothing about it.' So they both promised they wouldn't, and looked very happy like, and I  &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7088-00000182"/> 352        CHESTNUT WOOD. took the letter and come home; and now, Miss Palmy, if I hadn't told no lie no way, I should be happy as a king." "You haven't told a lie of malignity," was the only an- swer Palmy, in her great joy at finding herself so nicely cleared from any possible blame in the transaction, could find it in her heart to make; " and it's the intention that makes the action, so Mr. Rogers has frequently told us." 4' Yes, but Miss Palmy, I never told any thing but a good-natured lie in all my life, and the better natured I felt the more I was given to it; but Mr. Atherton don't make none of your minister's distinctions, He says.: ' Jerry, a falsehood is a falsehood, and all the worse for not having a sufficient excuse; don't deceive yourself, man, it won't help you.' I've half a mind, to-but there, I can't, and so it must go; only if he finds me out, I shouldn't wonder if he never spoke to me again, and some one else had the care of Chestnut Wood." Jerry looked very much troubled, and Miss Palmy, with her " lies of malignity " was no comforter. It would have been much miore to the point if she had tied on her bonnet, gone over to the parsonage, and by a confession of her own diminishing' eyesight, freed Jerry from any further telnpta- tion to deceive. But this would no more have . occurred to her than it would have to walk to New-York, and confess to Aunt-Mary that she'had yet left one natural power in great- er vigor than herself. It seemed hard to Jerry, as he went about his work, with a heavy heart, that when he might be so happy he really was so miserable; he had many times an inclination to walk to New-York, see Mr. Atherton and tell all he had done and why he had done it; but then if Miss Palmy, or Mrs. Rogers, or any one should find that out, he had better let it be as it was. And so he parleyed with his conscience, with- out satisfying its demands, and for not the first time in his   CHESTNUT WOOD.         353 life, had the comfort of feeling that he was much more sinned against than sinning. He began, however, to grow a little shy of 3Irs. Rogers, and afraid of a denouement when the party from New-York should arrive. It was really strange, what an altered iman he became in those few short weeks that intervened. A keen observer would have said he had been guilty of some great crime, which weighed down his spirits. No one, not even Mr. Atherton himself, would have felt that the cause was adequate to the. effect.  But Jerry had prided himself upon the way in which he had overcome his greatest fault; there was something manly and energetic about it which- quite pleased his self-love, and to find after all his gratulations that he was still vulnerable, had been attacked, and without a struggle had fallen, was mortifying in the ex- treme. His respect for his own character was sensibly di- minished, and after all, there is nothing in the world so- dif- ficult to bear as this species of detraction. Time never passed so quickly before; the weeks were soon gone. Jerry, with the carriage (the two gray colts were an interpolation of his own, like much else, which, as he could read only fron meiemory, he abundantly supplied), was waiting at the Rising Sun, when Maggy alighted; as Jerry saw her, all dressed in city style, handed out very politely by the driver, he at first imagined it must be some strange lady, who was a passenger with Maggy; but when she threw aside her veil, and discovered herself, he thought she had the prettiest face he ever saw, hardly, at that moment, ex- cepting Sybil's. She had grown thin and pale, from the change of air and work, and the hair that used to be flying in all directions was smoothed down over her forehead, as closely and as glossily as Aunt Mary's. Then she smiled so good-naturedly, and held out both hands so cordially, that there was no resisting her, and Jer- s.-o  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7088-00000183"/> 354        CHESTNUT WOOD. ry could fairly have hugged and kissed her in right good earnest, if there had not been so many by. Magyo must certainly have improved, or she would never have been sent down on this office of trust-so he thought, as he too, quite as politely as the stage-driver, handed her into his carriage. How many questions he had to ask, and what a communicative pleasant companion he found her! How she told him every little thing he wanted to know, ex- actly as he liked to hear it, and all the time how good-na- turedly she laughed at his many attempts at wit. Ah, Jer- ry, it would never do for Miss Palmy to see you now; she would be full of " little tremblings " all the rest of the day, and it might even spoil the jubilee before her! Jerry must have had quite a consciousness of this, for he did not take the road to Chestnut Wood that lay by her house, but the other one, so distant that she could not even catch a sight of the gray colts, though she stood on tiptoe at the kitchen window long after he was far on his way to Chestnut Wood. That was a pleasant drive, and Jerry and Maggy both remcmbeired it very frequently afterwards. Maggy brought a note to Jerry, with full directions, for all which Mr. Atherton wished done before they should re- turn; and in the bustle and excitement Jerry forgot his cause of unhappiness. He began to whistle once more at his work, and as he was mostly occupied around the house, Maggy listened to it until she herself began to hum .the same tunes, as she scoured, and swept, and dusted, in a man- ner of which even Mrs. Giles could not disapprove. Mr. Atherton would come home in his city carriage, so Jerry had no occasion to go to Hymeswold again; but he could do nothing but listen all the day upon which they were to arrive, and was heard, as he frequently opened the kitch- en door, to say to Maggy, " all done up." At last, howev- er, there was the distant sound of wheels. Jerry was at the   CHESTNUT WOOD.         355 gate leading into the avenue in a moment, but not before Nep, who jumped upon him with more force than even Jerrv knew very well- how to bear; and then followed almost as noisy greetings .from all the others, and Jerry's cap flew from one side of his head to the other, faster than it liad for some time before. "All is a secret, is it, Jerry?" whispered Aunt Mary, as she alighted. Jerry's face was scarlet in a moment. "I reckon so," he tried to say, with a knowing wink of his eye, but the clear bright eye fell, and Aunt Mary seeing something was wrong, forbore to question him any further. As he removed the luggage into the hall, she pointed two boxes to him. One," she said, " was filled with little things to add to the entertainment, and the other contained presents for Dinah, among which was the dress he had sent for." Mr. Ather- ton gave it to him to give her, as he had been so kind to her during their absence. He must manage as he thought best; she left it all to him. They were tired-should rest, and come down about! early candle-lighting." Mind he kept the secret  ".Dear me! Miss Rogers," said Jerry, looking at the boxes which she pointed out, without offering to touch them, "I am the unhappiest crittur you ever seed." There was something in his tone which told- he really meant what he said; and Aunt Mary looked at him in sur- prise. "Why, Jerry! we meant to make you very happy." "And that is jist the plague on't," he said, almost sadly. If you were cross, scolding folks, I shouldn't care a cop- per; but now, I say for't, I'll never be caught so again. I'd rather stand the whole militia on training day. I can't bear it, Miss Rogers, indeed I can't."  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7088-00000184"/> 356        CHESTNUT WOOD.  "Jerry, has any thing serious happened?" asked Miss Rogers, now really alarmed. "( Is my brother sick?" No, no, nothing is the matter with any body but me, and 'taint much matter if I ain't happy; I desarve to feel kind of worried like, it only paysme back." "But what has been done to you, Jerry, that troubles you so much? I can't imagine." ' Nothing has been done-and yet something has-and nobody's to blame, and yet I can't help thinking if Miss Palmy hadn't been so particular, things might have tlrned out different." "Miss Palmy-has she done any thing to trouble you?" "I am a great mind to tell you, Miss Rogers. It seems as if it would be such a comfort. You wouldn't mention it to no one, now, would you? Ain't you pretty good at keep- ing a secret? I guess you are." I can keep your secret very well, Jerry," said Aunt Mary, laughing, "but if it concerns any body else more than it does you, perhaps you had better not tell it to me. " It consarns me most, for I was the one that lied, you see, and no one else; but if I tell you, it will be letting the cat out of the bag the worst way. I say for't, it is the hard- est work I've done these two years-jest that little bit of a lie, and I should't use to have minded it no more than eat- ing my dinner. It seems to me, Miss Rogers, as if there was nothing in the world stirred up such a pother as giving a twist to the truth. It gets into a snarl right off, and then the more you work away at it to pick it out, the tighter it grows. Them green withs that they bound Samson with weren't nothing to it. Now, you see, if I should tell you about it you'd be mad, and perhaps go and tell Mr. Ather- ton, and he would be mad; and then Mrs. Rogers, she would hear of it and be put out; and Miss Palmy would be mad, too, and so it would go. All on you would have feelings as   CHESTNUT WOOD.         357 well as I, and so, I guess I may as well, arter all, keep it to myself. I desarve it-only it would have been a comfort." "Well, Jerry, you must decide for yourself; only, if I could really be any comfort to you I should be very glad to, and you need not be in the least afraid of my being mad." "La, now, you be good, I know you be, Miss Rogers; and it was only a lie I told about that letter of yourn, so I kind of think you have a right to know, you see," and Jerry lowered his voice to a most confidential tone-"I carried the letter to Mrs. Rogers, 'cause it was writ so fine Palmy nor I couldn't read it; and Palmy" (Jerry quite forgot his politeness in his eagerness), " old fool, didn't want her to know as how she couldn't read it, and so I told, I sartain did, Miss Rogers, though mayhap you wouldn't believe it, I told Mrs. Rogers Palmy didn't know I had brought it to hler, only I wanted she should know so much, I couldn't help it; and I told some other little lies along with it, 'cause a lie is a thing that is kind of sociable like, it never wants to stay by itself: where there is one you may be always sure there is another, or more likely a dozen of 'em. So you see, Miss Rogers, I have done that abominable thing that old Dinah; or the good book, I don't remember which, tells about; and now, if you will only be mad, or sarsy-call me names, I shall be much obleged to you-I. shall indeed, Miss Rlogers."' "Is that all, Jerry?." said Miss Rogers, very quietly. "All?" said Jerry, opening his large eyes still wider in astonishment-" all? why, ain't that enough? It's been victuals and drink to me ever since I done it, and whistling, too, for the matter of that. It's taken my heart clean out of m1e." : Jerry's former character for veracity was well known to Miss Rogers, so that it was almost impossible to convince herself that that was all he could mean now, and yet it was  &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7088-00000185"/> 358        CIESTNUT WOOD. obvious that there had been wrong done, and she would not on any account detract ever so little from his new-born sen- sitiveness. She hardly knew what to say, and Jerry stood watching the changes of her face with the anxiety of a child. "Well, Jerry," she said, at last, " you have done wrong, but I hope it will be a lesson to you all your future life. We often suffer more from a slight deviation froim the truth than from a more serious one, and this shows the kindness and wisdom of God. He makes the first entrance upon a wrong course painful and difficult for us. It is only after we have neglected to listen to this warning voice, that the path be- comes smooth and pleasant. This may keep you from doing what is more sinful at some future time." "Never catch me in this scrape again, I promise you, Miss Rogers. I likes to be happy and easy like altogether too much. If I ever get Mrs. Rogers and Miss Palmy mollified down, I say for it, I'll stick to truth like a tick all the rest of my life." Sybil and Mattic came now to see what could have be- come of Aunt Mary; and what with her good-natured re- marks, and the young girls' joy at being at home and seeing him again, Jerry soon felt the benefit of his confession, and his hearty laugh sounded as usual through the large hall at Chestnut Wood. "Early candle-lighting " saw the party all gathered into the little negro cottage at Pomp's pond. The surprise and Ai:5:^ure expressed was loud and excited, as it is apt to be on such occasions. Mrss. Rogers, to keep Jerry's secret, fairly outdid herself in exclamations of delight, though once her demonstrations were somewhat suddenly checked by catching what she was sure was one of Jerry's knowing winks aside to Miss Rogers. Had Jerry told her also? The surprise made her a little uncomfortable, and she deter-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         359 mined to take the earliest opportunity to satisfy herself on this point. At present she could onlywatch them. But for old Dinah! how passed the festival to her? Dressed in her usually neat manner, she was sitting in the old arm-chair, and the little room was full, very full of those who were so kind to her; but nothing was present to the old negro but the memory of that same day fifty years ago, when arrayed in her bright yellow turban, new calico dress, and with a white rose pinned in the bosom of it, Pomp led her a proud and happy bride to their little cabin, far away under the bright southern skies. She could see now the jessamine vine borne down with its fragrant weight of yel- low flowers, which he so carefully trained over the low door. Tiiere were no logs, no mud floor, no scanty furniture, no memory of work, and suffering, and oppression; these all had faded but the young husband and the creeping branches of the dear jessamine. Those were bright, and l1oved as well now as in that hour; but with these there minigled one more imago of af- fection. It was that of the fair girl who sat upon her seat at the old negro's feet, and who was still deemed but a spirit strayed from that other land where Pomp was again young, and the jessamines would blossom, and never, never die. So to the old negro passed the anniversary of her fiftieth wed- ding day! END OF VOL. I.   &#xD;</p>
