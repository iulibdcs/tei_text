A. STOM:Rsr OrF 'P' te DW RAY im   CHAPTER I; "' HELP, HELP, HELP!' It was a wild and piercing shriek, which sounded through the stilly night. A cry drawn forth by pain and terror. The earnestly beseeching cry of one in'dire distress-an almost despairing appeal for succor. The hour was late, and the streets were nearly deserted save by the home- less mwanderers and outcasts of society. A cold, wet night, with a biting wind- a pitiless blast that seemed to mock the thinly-clad' wanderers whom want de- prived of warmth and shelter. It was a night on which few from choice would have ventured abroad-a night on which the utterly miserable crouched  shivering on  dreary flag- stones, praying God to take away from them the life which was so -bitterly hard to bear. In the stony-hearted streets there was no kind, sympathising soul to hear  that piteous cry for help-no strong i arm to conime to the rescue of a fair and  fragile girl, struggling frantically,-/with E her brutal assailant.        I Scarcely eighteen summers had she I seen, though her lovely face, pale and N delicate, showed the not-easily-mis-  taken record of sorrow and want. Poor r thing! her troubles had in truth com- meneed early.            s She was miserablytlad, though her c few fluttering garments were arranged with care and neatness, and seemed to s show a striving at a better position in a life. It was difficult to guess at, the occu- pation of this young creature, but it was P plain that; youn/ as she was, her life   had been a hard struggle with want and sorrow. One glance into that sweets gentle face and those clear, open eyes of , heavenly blue proved that -hers had been a sinless life, and that she, though I reared, perchance, in some vile hot-bed of poverty and crime, had yet remained undefiled by her hideous surround- ings. From   the neighorhood of a low, i frowning archway, leading into a dark, narrow street, a man had sprung upon her as she passed4and seized her by the wrist.  "Help, help, help!" But no one was there to deliver her from his vice-like grasp. Muttering an oath between his clench- ed teeth, he bade her hold her peace. As they emerged from the shadow of the archway, the light of a gas-lamp revealed the featurej of her worst enemy!  A wolf in sheep's clig! Clad entirely in black, with the ex- ception of his necktie, he wore a some- what respectable appearance; he was evidently the leader of some  higihly sanctimonious little flock of true be- lievers; but no garb could conceal the brutal ruffianislm of his couniteinanee, which would have been sufficient  to give him six months at the hands of any magistrate. Holding her tightly'by the  wrist, he strove with his disengaged hand to cover her mouth. Again' and again she shrieked -for as- sistance, but, though there were lights at some of the windows in the alley, her cries attracted no attention. The ruffian shifted his hold from  her wrist to her waist. His strong arm   encircled her, and  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6980-00000003"/> though she struggled and fought with the energy of despair, she grew weaker every minute, and must shortly suc- cumb to her dastardly assailant. She threw her whole voice into one final appeal. "Help, help, help!" Hardly, however, had the cry ceased to ring through the deserted street when a strong hand was thrust in the Iruffian's neckerchief, a strong arm wrenched it round with strangling vio- lence, and he was flung to the ground. The girl staggered, half-fainting, to the wall, but, before her champion could render further assistance, the other man had picked himself up, and came rushing at him head-first, like a bull. His antagonist, stepping coolly on one side, let out his left with steam-engine velocity and power, and again the ruff- ian fell headlong to the pavement, but this time bleeding and senseless. "I think you've had enough of it, my fine fellow," said the poor girl's deliver- er, in a mocking tone; "if you differ from mIe, sly so." He walked up to his prostrate foe and bent over him; but the parson lay mo- tionless as a log. "I hope I haven't settled him alto- gether," said lie; "those blows under the ear are not very highly recommended by the faculty." Then, turning to the still trembling ' girl, who was standing with a  face white as death, and with her little lyand pressed to her beating heart, he ad-  dressed her for the first time. "Can I 1be of any further service to I you?" he aMsked, in a soft winning tone, which contrasted  strangely with the 1 muscular power he had just shown. s 1 "No, no, I thank you, sir," she at- swered, timidly lowering her eyes as she spoke; "I am  deeply grateful to I you for what you have already done, but--"  "But--"  "I am   close home, sir, and I need trouble you no further."      c "I beg your pardon," said the stran--s ger, who was a tall, handsome man of about five or six-and-twenty, with a pro- n fusion of light-brown, curly hair, laugh- y ing eyes, and a huge beard and mous- 1l tache, rather ragged and uncared for- "I beg your pardon; but, if I am not h mistaken, I have the pleasure of speak- of ing to the young lady who was waiting to-night at the stage door of the theatre h in Worth street."             L  The girl, blushing crimson, looked at r him with surprise, and stammered an - inaudible reply. ;' Miss Rose Seymour, is it not " "Yes, sir, that is my name. I was at the theatre to-night, waiting to see Mr. Colson, the manager." I  "I thought I was not mistaken. I b heard your name given to him, and I could not help noticing you; you were L so different from-" She looked at him inquiringly. "So different from the majority of those who come on similar errands." The girl blushed again, but made no reply. "I am engaged at the theatre myself," continued her communicative preserver. "My name is John Halliday, and I am a scene-painter there." "Indeed 1" "It is very late for you to be out alone, Miss Seymour; may I have the pleasure of escorting you to your door T" "Thank you," said the girl, uneasily, "I am close to my home and will not trouble you any further, though do not think me ungrateful for the service you have rendered me."       / "Psha! don't mention that. It was a real pleasure to knock the blackguard over. Hullo! What do you wantnow?" The latter portion'of his speech was addressed to his late antagonist, who had Etruggled to his feet and was swaying to and fro unsteadily. The light from the lamp at the en- trance to the place fell full upon his face-ugly at all times, but now doubly hideous, smeared with mud and blood "Nothing noiw,'" he growled, rubbing the hair from his eyes; " nothing now, but I won't forget you." "Nor I you, my friend." "I never forgot or forgave in my life. Did I, Miss Seymour!" The diabolical sneer with which he uttered these words made the scene- painter double his fist involuntarily. "There's along score to wipe out," continued the ruffian, "a very long score; but I never forget." "I shall give you something to re- mind you of me," said Halliday, "unless you make yourself scarce pretty quick- ly." But*the young girl eagerly caught his arm and drew him back with a cry of horror. "No, no!" she said, "do not touch him." "Why not t"   ?   "Do not ask me." "But I must ask you; for unless you have some powerful niotive, I certainly cannot resist the pleasure of-" "No! No!" she exclaimed wildly; "do not strike him again, I implore you." Well, if you don't wish it, I won't," said  the scene-painter, reluctantly  but it dpes seem a pity." "For Heaven's sake!-unless you would be my ruin-" The painter looked at her with the greatest surprise. He was well used to mystery and ad- venture on the stage, but he had never met before with it in real life. cHe looked down at the poor girl, who "ung imploringly on his arm. She was deadly pale, and quivering like alt aspen leaf. "At any rate, Miss Seymour, allow me to see you home." She made no reply, but her little white hand rested trustingly on his arm, and she walked by his side, though with weak and uncertain steps. - Her brutal assailant stared after them; his evil eyes lighted up with a glare of f savage hatred. "Curses upen  her!" he muttered, shaking his fist at their retreating forms;. "why wasI fool enough to risk so much when I  could have had her still more h: securely in my power? There are hun- dreds prettier than she, who would open their arms to me willnigly, but I must s needs long after her baby face; long 'c for it? ay, that I do! and by all the powers of heaven and hell I swear she shall yet be mine!"         I CHAPTER II.        di ", COME in, can't you? Now don't p' stand letting in all that cold. Confound oC it, this infernal hole is bad enough with- out that!"             ii So spoke, in a  peevish, complaining ca tone, a  man huddled together over a fu handful of fire, and seated in a room as miserable as can be imagined. A   room in which stood two rickletty " cane chairs and a  deal table which. seemed to be oply deliberating as to se: which of its remaining legs should give se: way in order to bring a cracked plate kn and a   stale loaf to the level of the car- yo petless floor.            ful "  Oh, it's you, Rose," said the man, bu slightly turning his head; "what a time ne you've been!"            tu    She made no reply, but busied herself rou in taking a few small articles of food nly from her pockets and arranging them around the loaf. ly;  "Can't you speak, eh? You go out ore and leave. your father the whole even- ing, and haven't a word to say when t," you come-in, Where have you been?" l:,  "To the theatre, father." "Well, what success?" ou  "None." Poor Rose, unable to restrain her feel- he ings any longer, burst into tears. "Curse it! I'm hanged if your whim- d- perinng isn't enough to drive a man mad. er Cry, cry, cry; you're always turning on the water, as if your father had been a ho turncock instead of a gentleman." "I can't help it, father-indeed I Lg can't. H--" -"Speak out, can't you?" w "Ihave beqn frightened, and--and-, "Frightened?   Psha! Did you see a ghost in the alley?" "No; but as I  passed along a man seized me by the wrist and held me fast." l; ' tI,! ha! ha!   A pretty thing to ,f frighten you! Who was it?": Rose made no answer. ,  "Did you know him?" ;   "Yes." 1 She replied so faintly, though, that e her fbther scarcely heard the word. "Well?" "Oh, father! you must guess who it t was. There is but one man we have  cause to dread." "You don't mean to tell me it was-" "Yes, yes, father. It was Samuel Heath." "Well, you're a  strange girl. What did you say to him?" "I  don't know what would have hap- pened but that a  gentleman kindly res- cued me, and-"   . "  Rescued? Confound his meddling impudbnce! What do you mean? You can't stand there and tell me you re- fused to lisfen to him?" "Father! father!' said the tremblingm girl, in tones of piteous supplication; "what would you have had me do ?" "Do?  I like that! That's a  nice, selfish speech! Do you know he can send me to prison to-morrow?  Do you know he can ruin me with a word? Do you know he is as spiteful and revenge- ful as the old Harry himself? A pretty business you've made of it! but you never had an Iatom of feeling in your na- ture."  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6980-00000004"/> Again poor Rose broke down and sobbed aloud. "There, leave off whining and make yourelf scarce; I expect a visitor." "A visitor, father I and at this hour of the night?" "What the devil do you mean by talking so to me? Am I bouud to get your permission before I ask a friend to call upon me?" Poor Rose only sighed; she was too well accustomed to hard words to be surprised at them. From her earliest infancy, curses and threats and abuse had sounded in her ears! She had some faint recollection of a happier time, when she saw finely- dressed ladies and gentlemen about her; but it was a dim, hazy remembrance, as of a dream, and she hardly knew whether it had any other origin than her own imagination. Slowly and sorrowfully at her father's command she gathered together the scanty out-door clothing she had dis- carded on entering the room; but ere she quitted the cold, dreary chamber a peculiar knock sounded at the door. It was followed almost instantaneous- ly by the lifting of the latch, and with quick strides a stranger entered the room. "Hullo! what's the meaning of this?" he asked anigrily, as his eyes ljghted on Rose; " couldn't you take care we were alone?" "Leave the room," said the other man, with a threatening gesture; "leave the room, or I'll not leave a bone in your body. It's only my daughter, sir," he added, turning to his visitor, and addressing him in an apologetic, cringing tone, which contrasted strong- ly with that which he had used to his daughter the moment before. Rose retired without a word, though not until she had closely observed the features of her father's visitor. He was considerably above the mid- dle height, and possessed an appear- ance which seemed to stamp him as be- longing to the upper class of society, despite his being attired in a shabby coat, wrapped round with a well-worn plaid. His face was strikingly handsome, but in his eyes, whch were dark and deeply set, there was a cold glitter, which at tiles imparted to his face an almost diabolical look.   1  A jet black moustache, carefully tended, showed off his white, shining 3 teeth, which at times seemed to snarl beneath the hair; but, in spite. of these r disagreeable attributes, when perfectly calm his form and features were those r with which painters and sculptors of t old embodied the heathen gods. ' "Now," cried the stranger, as Rose closed the door behind her, " are they finished?" "' Yes, sir, yes," muttered the elder man, at the same time fidgetting some- 1 what uneasily in his seat. "Well, out with them, then; I've no time to waste." The other rubbed his hands together, - but made no movement. "You hear!" 3  "Yes; I hear." "By Jove, then, you had better obey."  "Yes, Mr. Briggs, I hear, and will obey, but----" "Speak, man! can't you?" "I have been considering, sir, that the risk I run is vry great, and---" "And, therefore, ou are entitled to a greater recompease than that we agreed to originally? "Precisely." "You also think, I suppose, that I am in urgent want of those bits of paper?" "I suppose so," smirked the other. "And that, consequently, I shall be quite prepared to pay a large sum to obtain them?" Rose's father seemed to be somewhat taken aback by the supreme coolness of his visitor, and is face lost some- thing of his cunning pleasure; but lhe answered in the affirmative, though faintly. "Precisely.  Now, from your own lipsdI learn you to be an extortionate rogue, but yet I am. willing to deal fair- ly with you." The countenance of Hugh brightened up considerably, and he mechanically stretched forth his band. f "Not so fast, mv goo llow. 'Do you see this purse? \ He not only sat  it, almost de- voured it with his eyes, /the man ad- dressed held up a knitted purse, through the meshes of which the quick sight of Rose's father detected the glistening gold, at the same time that his ears drank in the sound of the chinking of the precious metal.   "Good.! It contains the exact amount we agreed beforehand was to be the price paid. Give me the paper and take it." Hugh shook his head. "You refuse?" "Yes." "How much more do you want t" "Double." Mr. Briggs put his hand in his pocket, and Hugh's eyes brightened as he fan- cied another glittering purse would be produced. But he was wrong. He had reckoned without his host. Something glittering came from his pocket, but it was not a purse! With two rapid strides the stranger reached himand ere he could utter a word or cf had twisted his fingers tightly in  s neckcloth, and had hurled him to thefoorc. Half-strangled, and totally incapable of uttering a sound, he lay prostrate, his visitor kneeling on his chest, holding the shining something, which was the barrel of a revolver, within a few inches of his forehead. "Now, Hugh Seymour, we are upon a more equal footing. Who is now to dictate the terms?" The prostrate man strove to call for help, buta tighter wrench at his necker- chief showed him the folly of the at- tempt. "It is useless to struggle," said Mr. Briggs. "Listen to me. I wish to converse with you, but I do notwish any witnesses called in; so remember, though I loosemy hold at your throat, I still keep a loaded revolver in my hand, and, if you utter one single word in a louder tone than that' in which we were just now speaking, that word shall be your death-warrant. Remember too, that, though I have no wish to com- mit murder, still to me my life is of greater value than yours. Get up." He relaxed his hold, and Hugh Sey- mour rose slowly and staggered to his feet.      e The first thing he saw was the barrel of the revolver pointed straight at his head. "Now, Hugh Seymour, bring me the paper." "And-and-themoney?" stammered the frightened man. "You have -forfeited all right to men- tion terms tome. Bring me the paper." Slowly and reluctantly, Seymour took t   ; from a cupboard a roll of thin tissue , paper, upon which several words had been engraved. The pieces of paper were not large, but at the top of each was engraved in Old English Aletters, ornamented l'with many flourishes, "Bank of  i' "Good," said Briggs, examining them: "you were not taught engraving for nothing, I see." So saying, he pocketed the roll andL looked with a -sardonic smfile full into the face of the man who had handed them to him. "Here" said he, with a short laugh; "here is half of the sum agreed upon. You have forfeited the other half by asking double; take it and be thankful. It isn't everyone who would have given you that much." "Stay," said Hugh, his face whitec with passion. "Listen to me; I can de- nounce you as an adventurer, a swind- ler, a--" "-Yes, my good fellow, you can, but who will believe you? while, on the contrary, if I denounce you as a forger- states prison, for life, remember!" With a pleasant smile upon his face Mr. Briggs turned and left the misera- ble room, totally heedless of the look of baffled cunning and hate with which his tool regarded him. Just before he- quitted the house he came again face-to-face with Rose, and now for the first time observed her per- soral appearance. For a moment they stood regarding each other in the passage, his face exj pressing admiration of her beauty, and hers astonishment at the presence of one sohandsomeand evidentlypatrician in this house of squalid poverty. She shrank backabaahed by his law- less gaze, and lh m  it her alarm. It was a first meeting, and destined to result inmisery; bitter, bitter mnisery to the poor, unhappy girl! CHAP'TER III. WHEN John Halliday's muscular arm had been called into requisition to pro. tect Rose from ,the insults of the ruffian who had dared to lay his hand upon her, she was returning to the dismal, dreary house she  called home, after having spent many hours TNwaiting in vain to sepe Mr. Colson, the well-known manager, in hope of obtaining an en- gagement in the ballet for the  forth- coming pantomime. /  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6980-00000005"/> Again and again she had been to that dark, grimy stage-door, hoping and longing for the good fortune of seeing the great man and urging her suit. Upon the afternoon of the day follow- ing her meeting with John Halliday she set forth yet once more to the theatre on North street. A fint hope still buoyed her up, though repeated repulses had done much to crush her sanguine nature. She found it hard to believe that one wiing and able to work might starve in the streets of such a city as New York. Weary and faint (for her last night's excitement had had a considerable effect upon her,) she arrived at that gloomy tieor through which so many passed thinly- and slatternly clad, to emerge upon the stage in all the glories of mus- lin and panges. "Can I see Mr. Colson?" she asked timidly of the stern door keeper. I'm very sorry, my dear," he com-  menced, grinning from ear to ear as he  spoke;, I'm very sorryl, but-----"  "Miss Seylour ", exclaimed some one  behind her in it tone of surprise. She turned and confronted the beard- ed artist, John Halliday, who had come 1 to her rescue so opportunely on the pre-  vious evening. Tremblinr, she held out her hand to him, and a deep blush Rpread overhanr o beat"^ d^111"^spread over .her  beautiful face as she remembered how d greaitly she was indebted to himn, and how utterly incapable she was of repay- ' ing him for his kindness to her.  t ask Do you wish to see Mr. Colson " he asked kindly.           I  "Yes, sir, I do indeed: oh, if you 1 could outly persuade him to give me an t engagement!",an "I fear I cannot undertake that, but t l can take you to him, and I am sure he would pay more attention to a request r from your lips than mine."  "Oh I thank you. thank you very n much!" "Follow me, then; take care how you go. Youll see, Miss Seymour, I am in a s very humble position here myself but u anything I cant do for you-take care of the step; now then, straight on." i So saying, he piloted Rose through all the intricacies of the mysterious region sl spoklen of as " behind the scenes," and he conducted her safelv to the manager's sh room.

Then, turning to the man, Jolln Hal- Iliday whispered a few words to him at th}e same time slipping something into shis hand. t  "' This man, Miss Seymour, will show you into Mr. Colson's room as soon as lie is disengaged, and believe me I wish e you success with all my heart." So saying, with a polite bow lme turned away andc soon disappeared in the gloom. L For nearly half an11 hour Rose remain- ed standing, looking at her dishmal sur- - roundings of black beams, complicated machinery andcoarsely-painted scenery and wondering lhow it was possible that wVhat she saw could everlook so bewitch- ing froml the otl'er side of the scellnes. She was aroused from her meditatlions by a hoarlse voice, which proceeded from the gentleman with the paperi' cap. "Miss! I say, miss!" "Yes "said Rose, turmng rotund, sup- 1osindi t to be herself who was thus ad- dlressed. "Mr. Colson 'll see you now, I tlhink. There's a gent with him, but I don't think he'll mind." WVith a fast-beating heart, Rose fol- lowed her hoarse guide into a little, close, hot room, where, seated carelessly on a table, with a bottle of brandy and a couple of glasses by his side, she beheld the theatrical king, Mr. Colson. There Twas anothelr gentletlman in the roomwhen Rose entered; but his back was towards the dloor, and she could not see his face. "Hullo! how did you come here?" This was the young girl's greeting, spoken in a harsh, rough voice, and with unnecessary sdlarpness. "I came, sir, hoping that you :would give me an engagement at the thheatre." "Oh, this sort of thing won't dlo; they shouldn't have let you in. I can't be bothered by every womanl whllo thinks she has a dramatic gelnius." Poor Rose shrankl abashed before the wTords of the manager, and could not summonoll up courage to answer him   Mr. Colson looked at her and could nlot fail to notice her extraordinav  beauty. "Well, what is it?" he asked, in a somewhat softer tone; "do you want to be a tragedy queen?" "No, sir, I thought, perhaps, in the ballet in the paintomime you might-" "All the vacancies were filled up two weeks ago." "Or anything, sir; I would do my  best; indeed I would." "Very likely," said the manager, drily.  "Oh, sir, can't you find me some em- ployment?" , "No."  Rose hid her face in her hands. '"Come, my good girl; we can't have any whimpering here; you must clear out, and the sooner the better."  As she raised her head the other occu- , pant of the room, who had hitherto re- mained silent and with his back towards -I her, turned rounld. e He was her father's mysterious visi- I tor of the previous night! i There could be no doubt-of the mat-  ? ter. There was the same handsome face, the same distinguished manner, s the same luxuriant moustache. He started slightly when his eyes crested on her, but otherwise gave no M token of recognition. ' "What are you doing, Colson." he said, as Rose made her way to the door; "that girl's face is worth a dozen of those frights you had last year." "Can't be helped, Mr. Briggs, the number's made up." "Well, what of that?/ Give one of them the sack."  [  "Nonsense! you know I can't." Though this conversation was car-  ;ned on in a low tone, it reached Rose's ears, and she paused irresolutely. ] "I kInow you can if you like; if you i Iwon't do it-"           ( "My dear fellow."  "Take her on, then, to oblige me, Colson." "It's very a:wkward."  "Not at all; it can easily be arranged. c So Miss--- Miss-- I begyour pardon, t but your name is---"  "Rose Seymour, sir." "Well then, Miss Seymour, you come a rehearsal to-morrow, and I'm sure n my friend Colson will be delighted to h you." "Oh, thank you, sir; thank you very i a   . e   d much," stammered Rose, in her delight y at this unexpected goog fortune. Mr. Briggs smiled grimly. A  "You are going home now, I sup- It pose, to tell your mother of your good fortune?" e  "I have no mother, sir," said Rose, and the tears came to her eyes. o  "Are you an orphan?" "I have a father." y A . And his name?" "Hugh, sir; Hugh Seymour." :, A demoniacal smile again passed over Briggs' face; but he asked no fur- - ther questions, but sat caressing his moustache, while Rose again returned her thanks. When the young girl left the man- ager's room she found John Halliday r waiting for her outside. There was no needfor him to question - her. The bright smile whcht up herface 3 was proof sufficient that she had been successful, and the good-hearted scene-  painter took!her little fingers in his big hand and congratulated her warmly. Wilingly, in reply to his questions, she told him all that had happened at the interview. When she mentioned the name, how- ever, his face darkened and he clenched his fist. "Beware of that man," he said. "Beware of him? In what way?' "He is a--he is a villain." ' Why, what has he done?" and Rose opened her beautiful eyes very wide. "I cannot tell you, for I only suspect and mistrust him." "Surely you are unjust; he appeared to be very kind." John Halliday made no reply, but conducted her back to the stage-door. It was late in the afternoon when Rose reached her home. As she was about to enter the house the door open- ed silently, sufficiently wide to admit of a man's egress. It was a tall, sanctimonious-looking person who came forth. His clothes were black and of a clerif cal cut, his white tie was dirty and tumbled, and his face was bound up on one side with a colored handkerchief. With a half-suppressed cry, Rose started aside; for in lim she recog- nised the scoundrel who had assaulted her the night blefore. Shuddering, she shrank away as from a reptile.  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6980-00000006"/> He did not see her, but pursued his way, a krin of satisfaction making his face appear still uglier than usual. No sooner had lie passed than Rose entered the house and hurried up the stairs. "Father, -father," she cried, as she entered the room, " what brought him here $" "Who do you mean?" asked Hugh, with an oath. "Samuel Heath!" He turned ghastly pale. "What do you mean, girl? Speak!" "I saw him quit the house not a minute ago." Hutgh grasped the edge of the ricket- ty table and stared vacantly before him. Then, suddenly rousing himself, he sprang to his feet. !"Curse him! a thousand curses on his prying, sneaking eyes! If he has seen "Seen what, father?"' "Nothing, nothing," he said, let#hg his head fall into his hands and groan- ing. "Rose," he added, presently, "I have seen no one since you left the house this morning. Are you positive of the man?" "I am." "And that it was from our door he took his departure?" "I could not be mistaken." "Then we shall hear of his visit in another way before many days have elapsed. Something must be done-- something must be done." "But, father, dear father, explain to me what is the cause of your fear." In vain, however, did she appeal to him. He waved her fiercely off, when she would have clung to him and en- circled his neck with her soft white arms. Mumbling unintelligibly to himself, he paced to and fro in the little room, ever  and anon wandering to the window and I peering down into the silent and de- serted street, with a scared, white face and bloodshot ees.        I The girl, crouching in a corner, dared not speak or move, lest she should again ( rouse his displeasure; and 'thus the ( weary hours passed, and night crept  down upon the city and filled the room with its shadows. It was not till it was quite dark that ] she rose to her feet and was stealing ^ away as noiselessly as possible when her father called out, in a loud, terrified t   voice, "Who's there? Who's there? 1: "'Tis I, father," replied the trembling: girl. "You? Curses light on you! What! do you want, stealing about like a thief : Are you in league with them? Are youi plaiing the spy upon me? By Heaven!t if I thought so-"     - As he spoke he clutched her by the! arm-his face distorted by passion, hi&amp;s whole frame trembling with his rage. "Father! father!" she cried, in terror, and raising her hands to ward off ) threatened blow. "A blight upon your pale face Andy smooth tongue!" exclaimed the desperl ' ado; "it is your fault that it has aL1 happened-it is your namby-pamby! modesty that has brought this evil upol i me." His fingers tightened their hold up m.:, her arm till theepain almost made herir shriek. "Father! you hurt my arm,*' she cried. With a savage oath, he shook b ,r vio- lently; then, with all his strenath, he hurled her from him. With a low, sobbing moan, bne stag- gered and fell, and, covering her face with her hands, cried aloud in the an- guish ofher heart.         I It was not the -blow, gh ougthat was bad enough; it was the cruelty that, prompted it. This was all that she had ever knowin of home-this the only parent she had to cling to through many long years of penury and privation, and whom, brute thqpgh he was to her, she yet dearly loweed; ay, loved as sufferingm wovman will love till the world's end, in spite of cruelty and neglect. Leaving her unheeded, Hugh returned to his post by the window and stared down into the street. The flickering of the uncertain light upon his face hall led her to think that she saw tears in his eyes. Was he sorry for his harshness to- wards her? Should she creep back to his side? Suddenly, while Rose stood yet irres- olute, he uttered a wild cry, and, with outstretched arm pointing to some ob-- ject in the street, screamed to her tol come and look also. Rose, hesitating no longer, sprang to his side and asked in terrified accents what had happened. He stood as if transfixed. His eyes glared wildly.   His limbs treinbled. He regarded her not, but still remain- ed with outstretched hand, staring in one direction. Rose looked towards the place to which he pointed. Standing beneath a gas-lamp on the other side of the street were the figures of three men-though, in the rapidly increasing darkness, Rose failed to rec- ognise in them any cause for alarm. Presently the lamp was lit, and a glare was thrown full upon the upturn- ed face of one of the trio. Rose turned ghastlyvpale. "Samuel Hath!" she exclaimed. "Yes," cried her father, fiercely. "But this night's work shall be his last; he has signed his .own death-warrat!" "Father, do not talk so wildly.!" said Rose. "Ah! are you there? Get to your room. Do you hear?" "Oh! what does this mean, father?" "Listen to me, girl," he said suddenly, in an unusually gentle tone; "go to your own room, and remember, what- ever you may hear during the night, remain there." "What dreadful thing is this? Oh, do not look at me in that way!" "It means that this very night in this very room, Samuel Heath and I will play a game, and the stake we play for will be life!" Rose lifted up her'hands imploringly. Hugh took no notice of her gesture. Carefully he removed a plank from the flooring of the room and took from a place of concealment a large, old-fash- ioned pistol. "To your room, girl," he cried, fierce- ly, pointing the- muzzle towards her. "If you stir outside the door till broad daylight  to-morrow  morning, your blood be upon your own head!" Slowly and  sadly she turned and quitted the room.           ] In the  excited state in which her ( father was-she knew that words would E only aggravate him. She knew but too well the savage fits 4 of frenzy to which he at times gave way. 'Trembling  she left the room  and ( sought her own apartment, which was immediately overhead. Silent and motionless, she remained in the cold, listening eagerly Xo the l faintest sounds which reached her from  c below.'    That some  terrible calamity was - hanging over her father she gathered i from his words. -That, some dreadful scene would be i enacted in the roonm below her she had little doubt. 3  What was this terrible influence , which Samuel Heath exerted over her father? She herself dreaded and disliked him but it was evident', that some-tronger feelings moved Hugh. It was quite dark. Even the faint, glimmer of the street lamps was shrouded in a thick fog. It was bitterly cold, and'Rose could hardly kee her teeth from chattering. To go to bed with such a presentiment of eVil was an impossibility. Rose took all the warm things she could find, and wrapped herself in them, and sat down t- watch and wait. The chimes from aneighboringchurch- steeple smote every quarter of -an -hour upon her listening ear; but as yet no unusual sound had startled her. She heard her father's step every now and then below. She heard sounds as if he were drag- ging about the scanty furniture. Then there was a long silence. A strong smell of burning arose, after a while, and thin wreaths of smoke came curling up through the Rfloring. Had he set the house on firel?  A thrill of terror passed, thrbugi her frame as this thought occurred to her. She was high up, at the top of the house. There was no trap-door! To fly down stairs, with the lower portion of the house in flames, was an impossibility. To cast herself from the window was certain death. So alarmed did she become ,as this thought momentarily took a stronger hold upon her mind that, heedless of her father's warnings, she rushed to the door, fully determined to descend the stairs at all hazards. She turned the handle, but the door did not open. She shook it with all her strength. She pushed against it with all her en- ergy. It remained quite immovable. It was locked on the outside. Large beads of perspiration. stood upon her forehead at the thought of the dreadful fate that she believed awaited her.  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6980-00000007"/> oso terrified was she that it was some time before she noticed. that the smell of burning had gone, and that the smoke no longer came up between the chinks of the Loards. He had not set the house on fire after all. What could he have been doing? Why was she made prisoner? Who had locked the door? Was it possible, she asked herself, that her father had been destroying pa- pers, in the expectation that the house might be searched t It was all a riddle to her, only to be cleared up by time. Again she settled herself to wait pa- tiently and listen for sounds from the room beneath.  The chimes froml the church steeple sounded again and again; but, although it was past midnight, nothing out of the commnlon had occurred. Wearied with waiting, and exhausted with fatigue anld excitement, she sank into an uneasy doze, from which she was suddenly awakened by the sound of voices. She started to her feet and listened intently. The voices came from the street. She ran to the window, opened it and looked out. The fog had partially cleared away, and she could just distinguish the forms of three men standing together at the door of the house. ("Open," said one; "open the door there."         \ There was no reply. Hugh Seymour was silent, and Rose did not dare speak. "Open, or it will be the worse for you, I say."  Still there was no reply. Then Rose heard a low, whispered conversation between the three. Then a crowhar was produced, and Rose heard the crazy door give way in a moment. The three men entered the house one after the other. Rose hardly dared breathe, for she knew the crisis was at hand. A dreadful longing to know the worst took possession of her.  She lay down upon the floor, so that a her ear might catch the slightest sound.  There was a slight movement in the z room beneath which told her that her father rwas on the alert.    e  The few mfautes she lay in this atti- l tute seemed hours to her. D  There was a sound of more whisper- ing. Then a fierce oath fromn her father. The report of a pistol. A shriek of pain and terror. A cry of some poor creature in the agonies of deaths hurried without a mo- ment's warning mto the presence of his , Maker. Rose shuddered. Who was it that had met with this dreadful fate? Who was it that had uttered that ' dektth-shriek in the stilly night? Was her father the victim, or was he the murderer? After a silence of only A few minutes' duration there was the sound of a heavy fall, and then the noise of scuffling and fighting. Eagerly Rose listened, to learn from the sounds, if possible, who was the victor. She fancied she heard her father's voice in a tone of pitiful supplication. She rose and ran to the door of her room. for she felt she could stand this holrrid uncertainty no longer. She mllust go and aid her father-her poor, aged father-whhovas struggling against such fearful odds. Poor girl! She did not remember that the door of her room lhad been fastened on the outside. She threw herself violently against it, as if her fragile form was sufficient to break it down. She strove to smash the lock with the poker, but without success. What could she do? As a prisoner she stood in her own room while the sounds of the struggle beneath her grew louder and louder. She felt sure that in the tumult she could distinguish her father's voice.  Then came a low, deep, gasping moan, and a heavy fall. After that, silence! Suddenly an idea occurred to Rose. Seizing the fire-irons, she forced up a part of the old and rotten floor; but her heart beat so violently at the thought of the horrors which might meet her eyes when she saw into the lower room that for some minutes she could not go on with her task. Presently recovering herself, she set to work and carefully scraped away   i  sufficient plaster to enable'her to peer into th e chamber of mystery. She could see nothing. She listened intently, but there was no sound to tell of any living creature being there. In her eagerness to see more of that dreadful room she leaned forward, forgetting that the lath and plaster were far too weak to support her.      F She felt them bulge with her weight. They yielded more and more. She struggled to reach the beam , which had supported the flooring, but with a loud crash the ceiling gave way S eneath her, and she fell in the room beneath. For some little time she lay stunned and insensible, but after a few minutes she revived. Bruised and hurt, but happily without any serious injury, she rose to her feet and gazed fearfully around.  The scanty furniture of the room had l been all piled up before the door to make a barricade. It was covered with blood!  Great pools lay on the floor, while in t three places a hand, iterally soaking a with blood, had been pressed against the white plaster of the walls. A sickening horror came over Rose. a The room appeared to be turning b round with her. All color deserted her cheeks.  d Her limbs trembled so that she could h hardly mlove. Just then were borne towards her the al chimes from the church steeple.   a] It was three o'clock in the morning. w No one, living or dead, was to be seen. The room was deserted,and save for b the tell-tale blood. Rose wouldhave been do inclined to believe the whole of the strlggle but a fever-wrought; phantom as of the brain. "Could it be fancy?" As her eyes roamed about the cham- do ber of crine, she thought she hearda a low, chuckling laugh. She paused and listened.  "Ha! ha! ha! ha!" It was not a good, cheery, wholesome an laugh, but  a low, quiet, demoniacal ch chucklie.  Whence did it proceed?   -   r There was no one near her.    ed *Suddenly raising her, eyes she saw,  peering through the hole which she had do in the ceiling, the hated face of her as- she sailant on the previous night, when 8h   eer John Halliday had so bravely come to her rescue. "Samuel Heath!" ms Eer cheek blanched and her lips quiv- Ire ered as she spoke the name. see  "At your service, my dear," said the led man,laughing. "'Did you think to es- ,nd cape mne?'" o Rose was too frightened to reply. t"Isn't it nie, my pretty one," said 9ithe ruffian; we've got the house all to ourselves, and no nasty scene-painter Lm can come here to spoil our love-making. ,ut Ah, my beauty! Yqu have to listen to' aY me, whether you like it or not." Rose shrank as far away as she could. td He noticed the movement and laughed. es  "Don't be frightened, my dear; peo- ple always like me when they know me at well enongh.^ et  "What have you done with my fath- er?" asked the 'poor girl, her anxiety Ld getting the better of her alarm. o  "Whatwill you give meif Itell you?"' "I have nothing to give." "Oh! yes, you have. A kiss from n those pretty lips would be a reward for ga king." She shuddered. ' Ytetl you what, Miss Rose, if I am at your side, I can talk to you a, deal better than up here, peeping at you like a bird in a cage; so I shall just come down. Did you come through this i hole? I wish I'd been there to see you." As he spoke, Rose saw that he was about to put his threat into execution and swrng himself down into the room where she was. With dcry of terror she darted to the barricade which still blocked up the doorway. Hastily she scrambled to the top, just as he dropped into the room. The young girl dased through the doorway, and the ruffian sprang after her, with an exclamation of baffled rage.- She had but a short start, but "Fear to her feet lent wings,", and she ran on, knowing that her only chance of safety lay in flight. In wild alarm she flew down stairs, dragged open the street door and rush. ed into the street. She heard 'her pursuer's footsteps closet behind her, and every moment she expected to feel his hand upon her shoulder.  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6980-00000008"/> Half-fainting with fatigue and fear t she still ran on, and paused not untkl,  her strength utterly failing -her, she was 1 fain to cling to a doorpost to save her- self from falling.  As she did so, the surrounding ,')- I jects seemed to dance confusedly before 1 her; a dark cloud fell over her eyes, and she sank down in a death-like swoon. ] CHAPTER IV Mr. Briggs had been a resident of America for more than two years. When he first appeared in the fash- ionable world no one knew whence he came, nor, in fact, anything respecting him. He appeared suddenly, and shone brilliantly, like a comet, and speedily obtained admission in the best society. He was handsome and well-bred, be- sides which, he had at his command an apparently inexhaustible supply of money. But a dark mystery hung over his earlier vears. He had travelled a great deal, and was supllosed to be a foreigner by birth, though whatt land owned him none but himself knew. On this subject he was ever silent. Now and then he gave charming little bachelor parties at his rooms in White street, and invitations to them were eagerly sought by those who admired the man that had the best wine and rode the best horses in New York. There were not wanting those who declared that Briggs made a good profit out of those little parties, and that after a night at cards he invariably rose a winner to a large amount. Be that as it may, he had many friends, and those of unquestionable character, who were prepared on every occasion to defend him against the at- tack of enemies. It was nearly ten o'clock, one cold, wet, foggy December evening, when Briggs sat alone in his luxuriously- furnished apartments. He was in evening dress, and in the front of his embroidered shirt he wore diamond studs which, must alone have been worth a small fortune. His face was as handsome as ever, and bore not a trace of care or anxiety ; yet he must have desired much not to be intruded upon, for before he had taken his seat he had carefully locked the door, and then even taken the trouble   to hang a cloth over the lock, so that no' spying eye at the .key4bole could note his movements. A silver urn, from w-hich the steam spurted and hissed.,stood near where he sat, aandboeneath' it apirit lamp burned to keep the water constantly boiling. Over the steanihe held an unopened pack of eards till the gum which held the ct ing ravr way, and the pack lay opened before him. Carefully he selected certain cards, ans with a small needle made some oscopic scratches on the back of'  ,te he had chosen. This done he returned the cards to their proper covering, and refastened it so that no one, even with the closest observation, could tell that it had been opened. Having served several packs in a similar way, fie put them carefully aside, unlocked the door, and by a bell summoned his servant to the room. "Francois," said he in French, which language he spoke to perfection,- Francois, clear away these things, and let me know directly any of my guests arrive." The valet bowed and silently set to work, while Mr. Briggs withdrew into an inner chlamber. The reception-room was a beautifully- furnisjied and admirably well-arranged apartment. Everything was in perfect taste. In each of the small recesses stood a lovely white marble statuette, relieved by a dark crimson curtain, and each statuette was lighted by a small globe- shaped lamp suspended before it. A few choice paintings hung round the room, while one end was devoted entirely to a collection of arms, ar- ranged in fanciful devices against the wall. There were swords and pistols of every age and every nation. There were Indian bows and arrows; there were formidable tomahawks, and, low down, within easy reach, a brace of handsome revolvers, the stocks curious- ly inlaid with silver, and the barrels beautifully wrought. When he returned from the inner room he found the first of his guests intently regarding his small armory.. He was a short, thickset man, and rejoiced in the name of Captain Roper. He was well known on -the turf, through not particularly favorably; in- deed, there had been a strong suspicion   of feot play respecting a horse of his which had not won a race, but, as noth- -I ing could be proved, and he was a well-4 , known fire-eater, he was still welcomed : in such society as he had previously admission to. "Well, captain," said  Briggs, gaily; "glad to see you here .again. What's the latest news from Melton V" The captain grasped his host's out- stretched hand warmly. "I've been studying your collection :! of arms; you have, some curious ones il here." -: 'Mere trifles. My hobby lies rather E that way." f "Those revolvers are handsome wea- : pons." 6 "Ah, yes; they are the only arms I keep for use; the others are only for show; but they-" W "Well?" !"Oh, one never knows what may happen. I always keep them loaded and ready for any emergency." "That's a strange fancy; I should think you--" "Mr. Jennings," said Francois, throw- ing open the door and announcing another guest. Briggs stepped forward and welcomed him, and his conversation with Captain Roper ceased. Mr. Jennings was a young, cheery, light-hearted fellow, who had just suc- ceeded to a large estate, which he was doing his best to squander in dissipation. The remainder of-the guests came in quick succession. Choice wines vere brought up and placed upon a side-table, cigars were liglhtcd,^and two whist tables were speedily formed. Two or three rubbers were )layed quietly enough, Briggs and his partner losing considerably; but at the end of that time the guests cried aloud for something more exciting, and rouge-et- znoir was proposed and agreed to unani- mnously. Mr. Briggs threw   aside the cards witth which they had been playing whist, and sport commenced in -ear- nest. Gold stood in heaps upon the table. The wine circulated freely. Bank notes changed hands with mar- vellous rapidity. Captain Roper and Jennings were the chief losers. Luck seemed to be dead against. them. J.   Every stake they made was a loss. "I tell you what,- Jennings," said t' {captain; , my purse cn't- stand this any longer; suppose you - nd I with- draw and have a quiet little game at ecarte at the other table?" "By all means; I'm- so deuced unfor- tunate to-night, it's no good backing ill- luck." Almost without notice from the others they were suffered. to leave the larger table and take their seats at a smaller one. There -was no dearth of cards, and these two men were soon immersed in their game. Yet, though the avowed object in leav- ing the other table was to avoid high play, the stakes for which they played were considerable. The gold at Captain Roper's side was steadily increasing. He won every game! All the good cards were in his hand at every deal. In spite of his opponent's entreaties, Jennings ceased to drink, and benft his energies to the cards. Yet, as he played, his eyes were ever fixed upon the captain's hands. Did he suspect foul play? There was an ominous contraction of his brow now and then when hi'oppo- nent, with a smile, laid down the winning card, but yet he said nothing. He spoke not a word, but watched. The captain's luck was so extraordi- nary as to be almost incomprehensible. Yet he associated with good and hoen- orable men, and - it was hard to suspect him of unfair play.      I Meanwhile, at the other table the play was high and exciting. The majority of those who were gath- ered round it were seasoned players, who could bear their losses with calm- ness and receive their winnings with apparent unconcern. Briggs as was usual with him waa a large winner. Still, everything was to all outward appearance so fair and above-board with him, his conversation so pleasant and amusing, -and his manner so well-bred, that no one questioned the fairness of his playS 1"He has the devil's own: luck." That-was the general opinion, openly expressed. Mr. Briggs showed his white teeth beneath his jetty moustache, and ap- peared to consider it a compliment.  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6980-00000009"/> He played on, and won. While the more eager of the gamblers were waitingwith outward calmness, but with inward anxiety, to see the fate of a larger stake than usual, a cry arose from the side table. "D--n you, sir, leave go! How dare you seize my hand?" The words were spoken in a fierce, angry tone. The speaker was Captain Roper. So loud and ferocious was the tone that every one turned on the instant. The pile of gold on the rouge-et-noir table was left, and the players all flocked to the further side of the room. A small table was overturned on the floor. Cards, gold and broken champagne glasses lay scattered about. Captain Roper was held firmly in his chair by Henry Jennings, his face crim- son with passion. The grasp of the latter was on his collar, while his other hand clutched tightly the wrist of his opponent. "What is the meaning of this?" asked Briggs, his clear, ringing voice sounding above the tumult. "The meaning is this, Mr. Briggs; we have amongst us a swindler and a rogue." Jennings spoke with perfect calmness and showed no unwonted excitement. It was plain to all that he was acting from conviction. The captain, (as he heard these, words, struggled vainly to free himself from his opponent's grasp. "It is a grave charge you bring, Mr. Jennings," said Brifggs; "and one which you Must lprove, or take the con- se(qulell'es.. " ' Listen to me, gentlemen," said Henry; "I have been playing ecarte with this man; I suspected him, and watchled. At last I caught him in the act of concealing a card in the hand which I now grasp. If in that hand you do not find a card hidden, I can only say I regret my violence." "Regret your violence? Do you think that will suffice? Iwill convince you all of my innocence." "Watch, gentlemen, for a proof of his roguery." As he spoke the young man loosened his hold. The captain turned an empty palm to them all! There was no card concealed! Jennings staggered back aghast.   He was positive he had not been mis- taken, and could only attribute the failure of the proof to some jugglery on the part of his opponent. "Mr. Jennins," said Briggs, gravely, "there appears to be no foundation for your accusition; you must answer for this strange disturbance." I' Answer! by Heaven, he c7all an- swer!" cried Captain Roper, startling to his feet; " ay, and on the spot!" With a hasty hand he snatched a couple of rapiers from the collection of small arms hanging against the wrall. Witheacurse, he threw one of them towards the young man, and, almost before he had picked it up, made a rapid pass at him, which threatened to put an end to his existence. In an instant, swords were crossed, and in a few seconds Captain Roper's weapon was struck from his hand by his opponent. It flew whirling across the room. Tlhe victor lowered his point. "Curse it! there can be no deception in ttiese," yelled the infuriated, disarm- ed man. So saying, he seized one of the revol- vers about which he had been convers- ing with Briggs, and, before any one could guess hs intention, aimed and fired at Jennings. The hammer fell with a faint click. No report followed. The pistol had missed fire! With a groan of disgust, all present rushed upon him. Briggs was first. He seized himn roughly, and in so doinW tore open his waistcoat. As he did so a crumpled card fell to the ground. "The card he concealed!" cried Jen- nings. So it was; Captain Roper was but a blackleg and a swindler, and, worse than being either, in the eyes of the world he was detected. He could no longer brazen it out. He turned ashy pale. His limbs shook beneath him. !"Mercy, mercy!" he found breath to gasp. "What is to be done with him 1" asked Briggs. "Drop him out of the window!" "Horsewhip him within an inch of his life!" i"Make him eat a pack of cards!"   "Hang him up to the firstAlamup-post and pop at him with the revolvers!" These were some of the suggestions made by the visitors. "Captain Roper," said Mr. Briggs; "you stand here a convicted, swindler, blackleg aud rogue. These gentlemen will, I am assured, agree with me when I say, if one of us catches sight of you on any race course in the country, he will consider it his duty to horsewhip you off it. Now be off, and remember!" The detected swindler, cowed and exposed, cringed. When he heard the light verdict, and felt his late host's hold removed from his collar, he rose and slunk away to the door like a beaten puppy. Arrived at the door, he turned and cast a look of hate around. "' Curse you all!" he cried; "I'll be even with you yet.  If I go to the world's end fbr it, I will have my re- venge for this night's work. You, James Briggs, may recollect what I say one day when your tricks are brought to light." "Scoundrel!" yelled the other, his White teeth showing like those of a savage beast. With one bound he was upon him. With one twist of his muscular arm he hurled him back into the room, and, taking a heavy hunting-whip from the wall, administered a very severe beat- ing to the detected one, who by neither sign nor word showed that he felt the pain or the degradation to which he was forced to submit. Released from the other's hands, how- ever, he crawled away, scowling evilly at the asselmbled company, turning only once to look back with a deadly-white face, quivering lips and heavy, blood- shot eyes, full of hellish passion. As he turned, his mouth slightly moved, as though he was 'breathing curses or muttering his threats against his late antagonists; but no word escaped him, and he passed away firom the sight of the assembled compa ny in a death-like silence. For some moments after the swind- ler's departure the guests stood silent and motionless, and then there was a general movement made in the dirlc- tion of the door. "Gentlemen, gentlemen," said Briggs with a forced smile; "you will not leave me thus?" "i don't feel inclined for more play   to-night," said Henry, very evidenty wishing to avoid meeting his host's en, and moving away as he spoke. "Nor I, nor I," muttered the remgUa- der of the company; and now all we e on the point of departure, when Briggs L flung himself between them and the door. "Ere you depart, gentlemen," he said, "you will, I trust, give me an assurance of your belief that I was until now to- tally ignorant of the character of the man whom I had for a gueest*- "Yes, yes; certainly," said one of I thZ gentleman nearest to him, though i m a hesitating tone.  "Your hand upon it, sir.' His guest tendered his hand, and the I .example was followed by the rest; buA then, after an awkward silence, all de- parted, leaving him slowly pacing to and fro in his deserted drawing-room. A fearful sight was it to see hia hanld- some face distorted by passion, as he r raised his clenched fists and poured ; forth a terrible curse upon the head of the luckless swindler captain. ; "This night's work," he muttered, "can never 'be undon'e. No, the firts brick of the house has fallen ; the secat of my life is no longer safe. But nt L yet, I swear before Heaven! not yet; if I , have life and strength left to me, I win I notshrink from the courseI have deter- mined upon! No, no! long and f1- ious career of profligay and diss-I tion is st in store for me Lovely women ill yet be found whom mr gold shl purchase--lovely women ;ai ruby wie-what care I for masse?" As he spoke he filled and drainted a goblet of sparkling chillpagne, then laughed a low, noiseless laugh,- which was peculiar to him, and 'm which hi cruel eyes took no part.  ' "Sweet Rose!" he mattered; "ya at least shall not escape me! No; :if ruin and disgrace stared me in the taee -if instant death threatened mIe- would not turn away from the course I have laid down! No, Rose; nothing'i heaven or earth can save thee. 1ThU shalt be mine, thou shalt be mine!" CHAPTER V. WHEN Rose Seymour recovered from the swoon into which dow had fallen after, effecting her escape from her assailant, she found a crowd of stran- gers round her, and a policeman who  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6980-00000010"/> was endeavoring to raise her from the ground. ' Opening her eyes, she gazed around in terror upon the unknown faces preeing upon her. Then, recollecting tsi danger which had so lately menaced her, she shrunk back, and faintly mur- mared a player for mercy. But as she did so, a voice, the tones of which seemed familiar to her, bade her not to be alarmed, and, looking up, she saw to her surprise her friend, the scene-painter, John Halliday. "Is it you?" she asked, with a faint smile; "where am I? Oh. save me from him!" "Pray do not be agitated, Miss Sey- mour; allow me to see you to your home, and you shall tell me what has wrcurred upon our way thither." The policeman, at Halliday's sugges- tion, obtained a cab, and the scene- painter, having placed his- fair charge inside the vehicle, as they travelled on- wards listened in wonder to the relation of the Rtrange and terrible scene through which she had just passed. "'There seems a fate about our meet- ing, Miss Seymour," said Halliday in a voice which, in spite of the effort made to conceal it, trembled perceptibly; "there is something more than mere chance about it. Would to Heaven, though, I had arrived sooner, so that I might have offered you more timely as- sistance!" They did not expect to find the cleri- cal scoundrel still lurking about Hugh Seymour's lodgings, and when they got back all was silent and deserted. The inhabitants of the low and squalid neilghborhood and the poverty-stricken house in which Rose and her father dwelt were too well accustomed to brawls and disturbances at all hours of the Might to lave been more than tempo- ralily aroused by the noise which Rose had- made in her flight from Samuel Heath. The young girl begged her new friend to wait for her at the door, whilst she proceoded tremblingly up-stairs to see whether or not her father had re- aurned. He was nowhere to be seen, and the rooms presentedl exactly the same ap- pearaLce as when she last saw them. What was to be done? - Yon must not think of remaining here," said John Halliday; " but must allow me to see yon to some respectable hotel, where -yo can stay till the -morn-   ng, when, perhaps, we may be able to clear up the mystery." She thankfully took his arm, and they walked along together. Presently he stopped and said with a hesitating voice: "You won't be cffended, I trust, with what I am going to say, Miss Seymour; but, if I might offer the shelter of my mother's roof, she will, I am certain, be only too happy to try her best to make you comfortable until you have time to settle your plans for the future." Rose would have refused, but a glance at ler friend's face convinced her of the purity of his intentions, and, going to his mother's house, she met there with so warm a welcome that from the first moment she felt completely at home and at her ease. At her ease as far as herself was con- cerned; but the dreadful anxiety which she felt with regard to the fate of her father rendered her low-spirited and miserable. The whole particulars of the fearful scene through which she had just passed were communicated to the authorities; but, though searching inquiries were immediately made by the most expe- rienced detectives, nothing was discov- ered either of Rose's father, or his sup- posed murderer. And thus a week passed, and the mys- tery was still unravelled. But the time was soon to come when all would be explained, as the future of this story will show. In the meanwhile (strange as it may seem, but necessity has no law,) our heroine daily attended her theatrical duties. Very soon Rosq became familiar with ballet life. Mr. Colson was secret- ly delighted with the notion of his hav- ing secured at a very cheap rate the ser- vices of a young creature so exquisitely graceful and possessing so faultless a form. Her training under Mr. Bates, the ballet-master, began in earnest the first day she joined the company, and, 'as perhaps some of our young lady readers may feel curious upon the subject, we will briefly describe the sort of life a ballet-girl goes through before she bursts upon your enraptured sight, a lovely vision as the premiere danseuse. Some very hard work comes first, and Rose was put through the following course. To begin with, her pretty little feet were placed inside a curious sort   of appaiatus, called a "groove box," and placed heel-to-heel in a straighi !line, the knees, of courset being turned :outwards, and the sides of the box being so contracted that-the toes could :o6t incline inward a hair's breadth. f The pain caused by this attitude was iAt first very severe; but Rose would Iot own to her sufferings, and, bearing it like a little martyr, she was delighted s-o find that after six or seven days her upple joints accustomed themselves %o he novel position, and her feetfelleasily uto the required position when she lanced. After she mastered this difficulty, l:ose hald next to essay another, rather lore formidable and fatiguing. v This was to rest her right foot on a )ar which she at the same time held in er left hand in a horizontal line, then arying the attitude with the left foot nd right hand, by means of which ovements the stiffness of the feet was a great measure destroyed.  V Having got thus far, she had now to lear  how to walk upon the extreme, oints of the toes, so that the leg and istep formed a straight line. This onle, she had to practice what are called calprioles," in which she, was expected perform four or five steps in the air, feiat productive of the most heart- reaking fatigue. Then followed all sorts of flings and lts and movements far too numerous to articularize; and then, in the rehearsal the pantomime she was compelled to ;o through a great deal of stage busi ess of so dangerous a nature that every ay she risked her life and limbs; for y bungling upon the part of Mr. Col- 1)'s carpenters, or a more than usual eakiness of Mr. Colson's machinery, iglt have dashed her headlong fromn e " flies" down the traps, to be taken ) , bruised and mutilated corpse. But Rose worked very hard indeed, id Mr. Bates was filled with delight the improvement his pupil made ider his tuition.      e "That girl will make a wonderful nccr," he said to Mr. Colson; " don't se her, my dear sir, don't lose her. le's a Cerito! She's an Ellsler! She's Taglioni!  She's a Ca'rlotta! Keep r, arld she'll make your fortune and r own, too." 31Mr. Colsonu listened  with a faint lile. "' I wish I could," said Colson, with a , lanl; "I wish  I were not in that   ' atrocious yilalin'Sa PoWrW, P oor O girl. i -f she only knew what misery is in store L for her!" I  Christinas drew near, hourly nearer, and the noise and bustle of the theatre increased 'daily. I John Halliday was scarcely ever able to findtime now to. come down to speak I a few words to Rose after rehearsal, and r when he did come he looked far from , heroic. A   shabby suit of clothes, splashed with whitewash, and with sundry dabs of various-colored paints about it, a face smeared in one or two places with Dutch pink, and a beard plentifully be- sprinkled with gold leaf, couled not be said to add much to his persontal attrac- tions. Still, his clear, blue eye and his merry ringing laugh were there. Rose always welcomed him with de- light, and lie for his part appeared to find a great charm in the pretty ballet- girl. A  constant visitor at the Theatre during the getting-up of the Christimnas pantomime was the handsome man call- ed Briggs. Whenever the opportunity of address- ing a few words to Rose presented itself- hle did not hesitate to avail himself of it, but, with a smile, would speak to her  with a quiet compliment or an amusing joke. Despite John Halliday's warning, she could not but be civil to him; for had he not procured her employment? Yet she mistrusted him. Briggrs smiled and showed his teeth. He bided his time. Boxing-night came at last. The last spangle was sewn on the Jiarlequin's dress, the last touch of paint was given to the DismalDepthsof Desolation, the last piece of gold leaf was laid on the scroll-work of the Palace of the King Bobtail, and the early arri- vals were hammering at the gallery door, impatient to be let in to secure front seats to witness the first perform- ance of the Fairy of the Dewy Dell, or Harlequin and the Magic Poker. A dull play, to which nobody listened, a merry overture, and then the tinkling of a little bell and the simultaneous rising of the curtain op .the Abode of the Demon of the Rocky Gorge, and the burlesque opening of the pantomime commenced.  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6980-00000011"/> A clashing of cymbals and a furious belaboring of the drum, and the Rocky Gorge, demon and all, gave way before the stage carpenters to the Dewy Dell of Delight. Rapturous applause broke from the audience as one of the most beautiful of Isherwood's scenes burst upon them. The car of the Goddess of Morning descended, and from it stepped one of the most lovely beings that could be conceived; for Rose Seymour had been selected by Mr. Colson to personate the goddess. Deafening applause broke from every part of the house. All paid tribute to the Queen of Beauty, who, radiant, beaming and happy, stood before them in the person of our heroine. Never had a more perfect and gen- uine success been achieved in the ballet. Mr. Colson rubbed his hands and chuckled. Mr. Bates prophesied great things of his pupil, and last, though not least, Mr. Briggrs, who was behind the scenes that night, showed his white teeth with a grim smile as he followed every move- ment of the lovely ballet-girl. "It cannot fail," he muttered to him- self; "she cannot suspect." It was a late hour before the panto- mime was over; but at last the clown committed his last felony, pantaloon re- ceived his last lick, and harlequin made his last leap through a respectable tradesnlan's window, and the audience turned out into thie sloppy streets to make the best of their way home, dis- cussing, as they went, the merits of the pantomime but all agreeing in praising to the skies the wonderful grace and bea uty of Rose Seymour. The frost, which had set in a few days before Christmas, had given way before a southerly wind. The pavement was slippery and un- pleasant. The lamps burnt dimly, and without it looked miserable and desolate. The streets were almost deserted. "Miss Seymour!" Rose heard her name spoken in a soft tone by some one behind her. She turned and saw Briggs. "Allow me to congratulate you, Miss Seymour, on your well-deserved success to-night." "You are very kind," said she; "but for your kind aid I should never have been allowed to appear."   She was standing by the 0. P. wing as she spoke, and still in her stage cos- tume. "The pleasure you have given me to- night fully repays me for any slight ser- vice I may have been to you," he re plied, with a graceful bow. There was a pause. Rose knew not what reply to make. In the distance, leaning against one of the scenes, she saw John Halliday, and the words of caution he had address- ed to her respecting Briggs came sud denly to her recollection. "Miss Seymour," said the latter, A" {i grieves me very much to have to say a word which can in any way lesse-n Qur night's enjoymeDt; but-but-I have a message for you." "A message! and for me?' "Yes, and one whichI fear will cause you sorrow."    \ "Speak! What is it?" "Your father-" "My father. O, do you know any- thing of himn? He-he disappeared some weeks ago, and I have been un- able to learn any tidings of him v "I grieve to be the bearer of evil news; but he is ill, seriously ill." "Oh, where is he? Let me go to. him." "You may possibly remember," said Briggs, "that when I first lbad the pleasure of meeccting you it was in your father's house." "Yes, yes," said Rose. "I only mention that to show you that Iam to be trusted-that I speak as the friend of Hugh Seymour." "Do not keep me in suspense! Tell me where he is, that I may go to him.", "May I not rather have the pleasure of conducting you to him?" Rose hesitated. "Do not allow any false sense ot modesty or propriety to hinder you from accepting my offer." Still she made no reply. "My carriage is waiting at the stage door, and will take you more rapidly than any public conveyance; besides, at this hbur of the night you should hardly venture out alone and unpro testd." "Thank you, thank you; I accept your offer." Briggs showed his teeth beneath his jetty-black moustache. "Come, then," said he, at the same time offering her his arm.   "I cannot go in this dress," said 1 Rose. * Remember," replied he, " every mo- ment is precious; you can wrap my cloak 'round you, and no one will no- tice your stage attire. Do not delay, I beseech you." For a moment she hesitated; but then, drawing the voluminous folds of the cloak about her, she took his arm. He led her rapidly to the stage door. On their way they met Mr. Colson, the manager. "I congratulate you on your success, Miss Seymour." He said this with a low bow and a conciliatory manner; but when her back was turned, exchanged a sinister smile with her companion. "Is all well?" he muttered almost below his breath. Briggs nodded sig- nificantly, as he led her towards the stage door. There, in the dark, narrow street, a handsome carriage was standing, the door of whicha servant in livery opened as they approached. But some faint suspicion of treachery, flashing across the poor girl's mind at this moment, caused her again to hesi- tate. ;  "Come-come," said Briggs, impa- tiently, and glancing nervously around as he did so, " we shall be too late." She knew not what to say-what excuse to urge; and yet her heart mis- gave her. Timidly drawing back, she had some notion of running up the stairs again toward the stage; but he caught her by the arm. At that moment footsteps were heard upon the staircase, and Jolhn Halliday was dimly discernible in the distance. Not an instant was to be lost if Briggs was to carry off his prize. He cast one comprehensive glance around, seized the beautiful girl in his arms, and carried her, in spite of her terrified re- sistance, to the carriage. Then, spring- ing in with his lovely burden, he bade the coachman drive on, and the latter, lashing his horses,-in another moment the vehicle reached the end of the street. Forgive me, my dear young lady," saim Briggs, " but every second is of the greatest importance; for your poor fathter is in a very critical state." Hastily disengaging herself from his embrace, the terrified girl scarcely knew whether or not to believe that she had been forcibly abducted.   The colachman was already 'intforlt,'l as to the road he was to take; for almost before the^ were seated the brougham started at a rapTid pace iln a westerly direction. For some minutesg they rode on in silence. Rose looked from the window, but failed to recognise any of the streets through which they passed. "Where is it that my fathler is 3'" she asked. "Do not be frightened, we shall soon be there." For a long time she remained without, speakling. They had left the paved and lighted - streets, and were going rapidly over a smooth road. As well as Rose could make out, hedges bounded each side of the way. They were going out into the coun- try. "Where are we V" asked Rose some- what uneasily. "This is thie Old Boston Road," said her conductor, in reply. "Have we much farther to go?" "No, we shall reach our destination in a few ninultes." Almost as he spoke the carriage came to a stand-still. But it was only for an instant-ap- parently while some large g'ates were opened to give the carriage ingress. The next minute thezy were driving up a gravelled road, bordered on each side by large trees. At last the vehicle stopped finally. Briggs sprang out and stood to as- sist the beautifil girl to alight. "Where are we t" she asked. "Where have you brought me?" "Do not be tfrightened," he made de an- swer; "you are quite safe here. Enter!" "My father can never be here ." she said. They had stopped before a large, old- fashioned house. The glimpse which the open door per- mitted disclosed a handsome hall, and beyond, a suite of rooms beautifully and tastefully furnihled. Rose, who had ever associatcdhcr father with squalid misery and abject poverty, was certainly justified in her doubt. "Enter; you have nothing to fear," repeated Briggs She availed hersef of his prof- fered arm, and, descending from. the brougham, entered the splendid hall.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6980-00000012"/> Side-by-side the deceiver and his vic- tim entered the house, within whose walls few so pure as Rose had ever been. "Where is my father " she asked. "Take me to him at once." "Nay, Miss Seymour, let me first offer you some refreshment." "Nothing, nothing!" she cried, im- patiently. "You must be fatigued after your evening's exertions. Let me beg of you to rest before you seek your father." "No, no! Tell me where he is and let me go to him." "Presently." "At once!" she cried, firmly. "I will not delay." "To-morrow will be time enough." "To-morrow?" "Yes; you will be stronger and more refreshed." Rose was terribly alarmed. John Halliday's warning seemed to ring in her ears, and she bitterly repent- ed of having left the theatre in the comlpany of this man. "I insist that you take me to my father-if he be in the house." "Which he is not," replied he, coolly. "Then you have deceived me." "Yes," he answered, smoothing his moustache. "Where am I, then T" she cried wild- ly. "Whose house is this t" "Mine." With a convulsive sob, which seemed to shake her whole frame, she buried her face in her lhands and wept. "Yes, dearest," said Briggs, "I am master of this house, and you shall be its lovely mistress." "Never, never!" "If I have erred," continued he, heedletss of the interruption, " attribute it only to my love; if I have deceived you in bringing you here, still love must ] plead my excuse. Do not turn your beautiful eyes away trom me. Pardon me the trick I have played upon you, and say you will be mine." ^  "31r. Briggs," said Rose, drawing I herself up to her full height; " sooner E than agree to your degrading proposals t I would kill myself. Do you suppose that there is nothing dearer to a woman f than gold and jewels T I scorn and despise you!"           i "Nay, pretty one; why so angry? t Remember you are now couIpletely in anmy power," and here he allowed his i   white teeth, " and that I have means to compel your compliance." "Never!" But he took her in his arm and, with- out paying any attention to her strug- gles or cries for help, bore her easily ; up-stairs to an elegantly furnished apartment. Here, when he loosened his hold of her. she ran from him terrified, and, r tremblingly clinging to the opposite ' wall, waited with blanched cheek and flashing eyes for a renewal of his vio- lence. But he only gazed at her for a moment with the same devilish smile, and then, turning upon his heel, left the room and closed and locked the door behind him. She stood motionless, listening to his retreating footsteps, and then gazing wildly around her. A lamp hanging from the cieling cast a dim, subdued light upon the objects whichh the room contained-heavy, old- fashioned furniture, surrounded by oak panelings, quaintly carved. Still as death she stood, her hand pressed upon her heart, her head gently bowed, listening to the sound of his steps until it died away altogether; then, looking about hurriedly to the right and left, with something of the action of X hunted stag when the bay of the hounds is swelling upon the air, she sought for some way of escape. That there was no time to lose she was certain; for, whatever motive at the present moment occasioned her jailor's absence, his return would be speedy. Her only hope of evading him, then, lay in prompt and energetic action. She must be bold and resolute-dare vll or lose all. With this idea she advanced rapidly towards the window and endeavored to raise the sash. It was heavy and swollen with the recent rain, and stuck fast in its frame; but fear len1, her strength, and she struggled desperately to effect her pur- pose. At lengtL it was forced upwards, and she gazed, with a? ist-beating heart, into the intense darkness below. She could form no notion of how far she was from the ground; but surely death was preferable to the hideous fate in store for her did she remain longer in the mercy of the miscreant. Leaving the window, however, for a moment, she cast a despairing glance r   aound, in the hope of seeing something that might assist her, and merciful Heaven directed her attention to a poignard which, among other ornaments, hung by the side of the mantel-piece. She sprang towards the weapon, drew it from its sheath, and, without a mo- ment's hesitation, busied herself -in slashing down the damask window- curtains, With nervously-twitching, but .agile fingers, Rose ripped the tough fabric in. twain, and fashioned it into a rope, which she rapidly but firmly secured to a heavy piece of furniture standing close to the window. Scarcely had she completed her itask before she heard a movement ini the house, as though steps were approach- ing the door. In speechless terror she paused to Us- ten, and feeling certain that she was not deceived, clambered lightly through the window, clutched the rope, and glided rapidly to the earth. Trusting to Providence that shemight choose, the right direction, she rushed from the spot, forcing her way through a dense growth of rank weedsland strag- gling brushwood, -which formed a sort of hedge dividing the garden from a field beyond. Heedless of the difficulties in her way, she rfished ,wildly onwards and paused ,only when, breathless and half-fainting, she reached a fence separating the field from the high road. 'Afar- off in thei distance she could see ights flashing fitfully to and fro, -and could hear the sound of men's voices calling to one anothbr. Summoning all the strength that yet, remained to her, Rose clambered to the top of the-fence, dropped down into the road, and then ran on again. A wild open country surrounded her on all sides, without a sign .of human 0 habitation.          '  1 Ignorant whither her steps were tak- ing her, she ran on and on, down long, ] interminable lanes, until, prostrated by 1 fatigue, she sank in an almost lifeless X state upon the ground by the road-side. Fortune, however, did nAot now be- C friend her as it had done when she made her escape from her clerical assailant at her father's house, by sending honest John Halliday to her aid. When she again opened her eyes she was shivering with cold and wet to the skin from the heavily falling rain, and the road was still dark and lonely. 1   Rising to her- feet, she 'tagered onj- l wards as well as her trembling limbs ' would allow. Suddenly, in front, she saw a faint glimmering through- the window-blind r of a mean-looking house. - The, sight lent her fresh strength, I and she now proceeded at a more rapid ' pace. As she approached- it, however, trange,-moaning sound strauck upon 'her eat and caused her to look around t in painful suspense. What had alarmed her, though, she ' found to be the river, running rapidly past the weedy, rush-grown  banck, where stood the house in question. Approaching the door, she hesitated a moment, and, summoning up courage, knocked twice. She fancied,; as she drew near, t ;af she could hear the low murmur of voices within; but now there was a death-like silence. Again- she knocked; and'then a heavy foot-fall sounded upon the floor, and the door slowly opened. On the threshold a blear-eyed old hag, with ragged, unkempt locks, stood blinking from behind a flaring tallow candle, which she shaded from the wind with one of her long, claw-like hav-es, whilst ,behind her stood  a scowling, beetle-browed ruffian who seemed to be Clutching a 'heavy bludgeon in an atti- tude, of defence. "I have lost my way," said Rose, timidly; " would you give me shelter for an hour or two, until light?" The old hag stood in, astonishment at the costume which Rose wore, and made no reply,- but the man quickly said: "Yes, yes; come in. Are you alone?" Rose replied in the affirmative, and crossed the threshold. The door closed heavily behind her, and the'old hag, at a sign from her companion, chained and bolted it. A  wretched hovel it was in which Rose fouonds herself, and sinister uAni threatening were the faces of her host and hostess. The hour was very late; the  spot entirely deserted. At whose mercy was she now, and what new danger awaited her I CHAPTER VI. As the door closed behind her, Rosen' heart sunk within hler.  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6980-00000013"/> She had escaped one danger, it is true; but was it only to encounter an- oler?  The interior of the house in which sin. hiad taken refuge was pnean and shabby in the extreme, and the coun- tenances of its inmates most repulsive. Their rough tongues seemed to find it dicknlt to frame courteous sentences, and polite phrases sat upon them with bai grace, though both the man and the woman, in a rude, uncouth fashion, did th-ejr best for her comfort. I. dress (alas for the poor dress! it wa Is now much torn and mud-bespat- tered) was taken by the old hag to dry, Tut on the fair, white, rounded arm of She poor girl still glistened a bracelet which she had worn at the theatre the night before, and which, if of real O11ons, would have been worth a small kingdom. CnW this the eyes of the beetle-browed ratilan fixed themselves with a covetous -em; but Rose noticed him not as she ":tJ near the dying embers of the past fotv 1ours. "Come, old woman," cried the man, iu lo1d, harsh tones, "here's this 'ere poor gal a perishing o' cold. Show her the bedroom, can't yer?" The old. hag stared, and muttered cietliing between her teeth; but, 3,tchig 111) a flarin tallpw candle which, stuck in the neck of an old bot- tle, served to light the apartment, and igning to Rose to follow her, she led the way to a ladder, which was the only means of communication with the upper story. Rose shrank back. She hesitated to ascend a tumble- down ladder, leading  she knew not whither. "Go up, I tell yer," said'the hag. I' rather not. No - I will stay down here till daylight," "He says you're to goa up," said the hag, "and when he says a thing, he AmamS it--he do!" -. .- :' " Now, then, with that-light, motherl" e^iL tiro man, with an oath. "Up! up! Quick, or it'll be the werso for you." Rose ascended the ladder in safety, atst^taw shatshe was in a sort of loft. Her head almost touched the rafters, and the floor was littered with straw. "Lie down and go to sleep," said the old woman, and she disappeared down the ladder, taking the light with her, and leaving Rose in total darkness.   For some minutes our heroine stood afraid to move a step; but as her eyes becnme better accustomed to the dark- ness, she grew bolder, and, advancing to the narrow aperture which answered the purpose of a window, she looked out. The wall of the house seemed to go straight down into the water,; for beneath her the ripples came sluggishy plashing, and she could just discern the dim outline of a boat moored to a stake driven deep into the mud. Her present position was fraught with peril. She could not but mistrust the in- habitants of the hut, though as yet she had no proof of their entertaining any ill-feeling towards her. Wearily she turned away from the window, and, gathering together an armful of staw, seated herself upon it, determined not to close her eyes; but her efforts were in vain; exhausted nature exercised her sway, and poor Rose soon fell into a deep slumber. After a while she awoke suddenly. How long she had been asleep she had no means of ascertaining, but now the faint grey light of early dawn was beginning to make things partly visible in a misty, ghost-like manner. Immediately beneath her she heard the voices of the man and woman in fierce conversation. "I tell you, yes!" said the man, "' I saw the jewels a-twinkling on her arm like blazes. They'd set you and me up for life, that's what they'd do." "How are yer a-going to get 'em?" "Trust me for that. Give me hold o' that there knife." Rose instinctively felt that she was the subject of the conversation of these - wretches. She felt that her life was about to be sacrificed for a trumpery theatrical gew- gaw, not worth a crown. What could she do?  Would they let her go if she gave them the mock diamonds? When she next heard the voices the speakers had evidently altered their position. They had come to the bottomt of the ladder leading to the loft in whiNh she lay, pale and trembling. "Now listen to me, mother," said the man, with an oath: "as soon as I've got up, you pull the ladder away, so that she can't escape. Do yol hear ." "Ay, ay; I'm not deaf," grumbled the other.   "Well, you just mind what you're at, that's all." A moment's pause, and then the sound of heavy footsteps on the creak- ing ladder. Rose shrAnk into the farthest and darkest corner of the loft as the head of the beetle-browed ruffian appeared at the trap. With the exception of a space of a few feet round the window, where the early rays of light penetrated, the loft was in complete darkness. With beating heart and bated breath, Rose watched the ruffian, as for a few moments he stood near the window, a long-bladed knife held firmly between his teeth. Rose hastily put her hand into the bosom of her dress, and pulled out the poignard which hlad rendered her such good service when escaping from Mr. Briggs. It was a tiny weapon, better suited for a toy than for a death-struggle ; but on it rested Rose's only hope of life. With low mumbled curses the ruffian commenced feeling about in every direction. Rose shrank still further back. Growling -at himself, he stumbled along, but without searching the corner in which our -heroine was concealed. Then he suddenly paused. "She can't have got away, nohow," he muttered perplexed. Then guiding himself by the wall, he commenced making a tour of the loft. If he only persevered in this plan Rose knew she must be discovered. Again she saw him go across the light, but it was only a momentary glimpse she obtalned of him, and then he plunged again into the shade. Rose felt he was drawing near her; she heard his low muttered curses and his stealthy footfall, but how near she 3ould not tell. Clutching her dagger tightly in her little hand, she scarcely dared to breathe. All was silent as the grave. She knew nothing, heard nothing, of aer pursuer's whereabouts till a cold clammy hand rested on her bare shoul- ders. With a scream she started from her place of concealment. With an oath and a yell of triumph he followed her. Then, her eyes glaring fiercely, like   those of a tiger at bay, she turned and confronted him. With impetuous force he rushed on her and seized her by the throat. Her brain whirled round, she almost lost consciousness, and sank to the ground. With a low laugh, he bent over her, and raised on high the arm holding the long-bladedl 'knife. Then only was it that Rose recovered her presence of mind sufficiently to act Striking upward with her tiny dag- ger, its sharp point entered the cheek of her antagonist as he bent over her, and as he moved started a crimson stream across his scowling face. With a frightful yell, he put up both his hands, for the blood, raining over his face, blinded him. To do this he was forced to relinquish his hold of Rose, who, not slow to seize this opportunity of escape, pushed him from her with all her force, and stag- gered to her feet. There was not a moment to lose. How was her escape to be made? The ladder was gone!       j One chance  alone remained-tho window. It was just large enough for her to squeeze through, and, to her great joy, she saw the tide had risen considerably, and ,the leap was nothing very terrific for au expert driver. Without a moments hesitation she plunged headlong into the muddy river. As she regained the surface, a few strokes took her to the boat, into which she clambered. Then, looking up at the window whence she had jumped, she saw the hideous blood-stained features of her would-be murderer glaring furiously at her. Her nimble fingers speedily unfasten- ed the rope with which the boat was moored, and then, with one vigorous push, she launched the frail bark out into the stream. She was only just in time, for aspin that ill-favored face appeared at tlhe window, and a couple of sharp reports in quick succession from a pistol, and the sprinkling of the shot like hail in the water around her, warned her that she had no time to spare. With a few rapid strokes of the sculls Rose took the boat still further away from the land, and then, directing its  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6980-00000014"/> head down the stream, the tide being in her favor, she soon turned a bend in the river, and lost sight of the hate- ful house. Now she had time for reflection; so, nnshipping her sculls, she allowed the boat to drift with the current while she endeavored to settle the course which it would be the best for her to pursue. It was now nearly broad daylight, and in a few minutes she would reach the more crowded part of the river, where ,she would certainly attract attention, which, however flattering it might be, was not at all what she desired. While yet- she pondered her eye rested upon a bundle lying in the stern of the boat. Eagerly she seized it, and found that it contained a suit of boy's clothes, which, although somewhat too large for her, would, nevertheless, serve the pur- poses of disguise and warmth; for, be it remembered, a ballet-dress, however pretty, is not exactly suited to a river excursion on a frosty December morn- ing. Again seizing the sculls, she impelled the boat towards the shore at a part, where a reed-grown bank seemed to offer her the best concealment, and in a very short time emerged, looking as pretty and fragile a sailor-boy as you can imagine. "I've got the boat here," she said to ( herself, " so I may as Nfell float down." I So saying, she again stepped into the little bark, and in a few minutes was s once more floating gaily down in mid- i stream towards the city.      1 Rose directed the skiff towards a landing place just on the upper side of e the Harlem bridge.         a It was yet early, and but few people were about, but some half-dozen water-  men were lounging at the pier.   T "Hullo, little 'un," cried one, " where d do you hail from t"        i "Likely-looking lad enough," said another. "Ugh! do   better in petticoats," growled a  third. It required some little courage on the i part of Rose to walk past these men, for the dress she wore was strange to b her, and she much feared she might be ii discovered by her awkwardness:   8 "Here, you fellows, look after my n boat," she said, in as consequential and fi swaggering a tone as she could assume,   g and then, putting her hands into her d pockets, she strolled past the groupe of - men and walked sharply in the direc- tion of Mrs. Halliday's house, which ), she had learnt to call " home." a  Twenty   minutes' brisk  walking e brought her to the door, which happen- 3 ed to be openl O  Rose entered, rapidly ascended the stairs, and knocked at the door of Mrs. I Halliday's room. e  "Come in,? said that worthy old lady. e  Rose avaOed herself of the permis- , sion; but when Mrs. Halliday, who had , not yet completed her toilet, saw what she believed to be a good looking sailor a boy enter her room she gave a shrill I scream, and qhastily threw her dress over'her sho'ulders. b "Don't you know me?-Rose Q" said , our heroine. "Lor me! and so it is: and oh! the state John's ibeen in about you and where have you been? which the dress, it becomes you  well; though  fine feathers don't) make fine birds, and I hope it's no harm; none of those mask- ed balls and wickedness, because it's pale you are, my darling, and a little  drop of brandy, though it is early in the morniing, and such are courses I don't approve, and you haven't told me a bit about it yet." So ran on the worthy kind-hearted talkative old lady, patting Rose on the cheek, as she spoke, and holding her hand in her own. Rose commenced a narration of her adventures, but before she lhad half told them, her strength gave way, and she burst into a flood of tears. U Bless you, my dear, don't fret," cried the old lady; Ad your troubles are all over now." Good old soul! had Rose's troubles even began? Oh! if she had known what a fearful fate awaited her! what dreadful end she was rapidly approach- ing. CHAPTER   VII. Fon many long weary hours Rose lay in a  state of dreamy unconsciousness. Sleep refused to come to her relief, but, as she lay with closed eyes court- ing repose, the events which had pressed so quickly upon her throuigh the last night once more became realities to her fevered brain. In her. mind's eye she saw again the   handsome demonical face of Briggs, the splendor of his courtly house, the waterside cottage, and the lazy plash- ing river. Then the kind motherly face of Mrs. fIalliday bending over her, recalled her to the present, and she turned with a sihll of relief again to- court slumber, bult in vain. "Rose, my dear," said the old lady, "-llat will you do about the theatre to- nighlt? There is that dress of yours, which fromn top to bottom is a sight to see, the mud and the rents being such as no Christian needlewoman could mend, let alone a poor widow." With something Jike a groan Rose strove to think of thefuture. What awaited her! Must she again brave the dangers of the theatre? Wohild not the ight of Briggs' pale handsome face drive her wild with anger. Then, on the other hand if she were to throw up her engagement what could she dn? Her father had disappeared, and there was Do one in the wide. world to whom she could appeal for help. Upon her employment at the theatre depended her daily bread and she must brave all perils or starve. "Itell you what, dear," continued Mrs. Halliday,- "I'll set to work and make you a new skirt. It won't take long, though .when poor. Halliday was alive it was but seldom I used a needle; but necessity is the soul of business, and I'll do my best." Rose protested, but in vain. She offered to assist, but the kind- hearted wonan with gentle force com- pelled her to remain at rest, while with many little interjections and misquoted proverbs, she. sought her needle and thread, and sent the dingy maid of all work for, the muslin. "Bless my heart!" cried Mrs. Halli. day, after a while, and so suddenly as to make Rose start. from  a fitful and uneasy doze into which she had fallen, "bless my  heart it's near six o'clock and the dress not half-finished, and seven's the latest, and if it isn't done Mr. Colson will be in a way, though how a widow with a son and christenedJohn who's been gone since morning, can do it in time is more than I know." Before she half finished her speech Rose hadrisen, and was blsily employed with needle and thread.   There was littie time to spare, and when the skirt was at length completed it wanted but a quarter of an hour to the time at which Rose should be at the theatre. "I tell you what it is, Rose, you'll have to dress here and take a coach down to Worth street, though public vehicles are bad, they being always en- , gaged in taking small pox cases to the hospital, and well I remember when poor dear Halliday was alive-" ' "Yes, yes," interrupted Rose, know- ing how difficult it was to silence the old lady when once she commenced her early reminiscences, " yes, Mrs. Halli- day, I will dress for the theatre at once." With far different feelings from those ,with which. on the previous- night she attired herself for her first appearance, Rose again donned the costume of a ballet-gkrl. Her heart sank within her, and her limbs trembled- beneath- her, but the knowledge of the necessity of being at the theatre, in proper time gave her strength, and in a wonderfully short time she had arrayed herself as the Fairy of the Dewy Dell. She looked almost more beautiful than on the precedingl- night. The pallor-caused by all she had gone through since quitting the stage added a lustre to her beautiful eyes, and as she looked at her own reflection in a glass she saw that she was beautiful, and sighed. Sighed-for- she knew a little of the misery of a pretty girl without a strong protecting arm to- fight her battles, and to shieldher from evil. She knew something of the perils which shermight be called upon to en- counter; -but -could she  have fore- seen all that cruel fate had in store for her -she would - rather have thrown her- self from the bridge into the river than have left the shelter of Mrs. Halliday's roof that night.  But*there was no friendly voice to warn her of her impending danger, no kind hand to guide her sustain her faltering footsteps. Into the cold world, alone and help- less,.she was forced to go, to fight and struggle, to sink or swim, as Fate or- dained. John Halliday was at the theatre, and to him only, in the whole universe, could she look for advice and assistance.  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6980-00000015"/> As RHose put the finishinug tocllllt,. t,. her toilet, Mrs. Halliday knocked at the door. "For the last two hours and more, my dear, there's been a coach a-loiter- ing in a way the police should not allow up aund down the street, but it's turned out lucky, as it happins, and it's now at thl door a-waiting, and if you're afraid ay the word, and I'll put on my bon- net and shawl, and come with you; but the driver looks sober, and a young man, quite the gentleman I assure you, is a-sitting by his side conversing affa- ble and quoting poetry." "Thank you, dear Mrs. Halliday, I would not trouble you for the world; I shall be quite safe by myself." The coach was waiting at the door, and the young man got down and. as- sisted Rose, who was wrapped in a long cloak, which quite concealed her ballet dress, to enter. I1.ardly waiting to hear the direction she gave, he sprang back to his seat by tle driver, and the vehicle drove off at a rapid rate. Poor Rose! Has she but known, she would sooner have cutoff her right arm than have entered that coach. On, on they drove through the dark streets, over whichh a thick fog had settled that rendered everything murky and indistinct. The lamps shied but little light, but still the coach drove on at a great speed, in spite of theO shouts and oaths from the drivers of other vehicles with which it nearly came into collision, and the frightened screams of foot passengers who were nearly run over by it. Rose began to feel frightened. Was the driver intoxicated? Was he taking her in the right direc- tion? Eagerly she peered from the window, but the fog was so dense that she could not make out with any degree of cer- tainty where she was. "Stop! stop!" she cried, thoroughly frightened. The speed if anything increased. She let down the window and put out 1her head. "Stop! let me out!" she exclaimed. There was no answer to her cry "Where are you taking me ", The coach sharply turned a corner, and went jolting down whallt Roso made out to be a mean-looking street. Again she shrieked at the top of her   voice, but no attention was paid to her cries. "Help! help!" she cried in despair, trusting some passer-by might come to her rescue. "Let me out! Help!" The vehicle stopped so suddenly as to throw Rose forward, and the next mo- ment the man who had been riding with the driver appeared at the door. "Did you call, miss?" "Yes, yes. You are taking me in a wrong direction. Let me out." The man opened the coach door as she spoke. "I told you to drive me to-" Before she could complete her sen- tence he had sprung into the coach and firmly placed his hand over her mouth to stifle her cries. The driver descended from his box, and the other man with strong arm bore the unfortunate girl from the vehicle. The door of a house close by was open, and ere Rose could utter a word she was carried into a dark passage, and the door closed upon her. It was slammed with an ominous sound the poor girl's heart sank within her. Again she was the victim of some base plot. The hand was still pressed tightly over her mouth as she was dragged, rather than led, along the passage. A sudden push forced her to enter a room opening from the dark passage, which was illuminated by a single ray of light. The hand was removed from her mouth, and stumbledforward into the darkness.        / As she did so the door behind her was shut, and she heard the key turned in the lock. The sound sent a cold thrill of hor- ror through her frame. She was a prisoner. Whose work was it? Had she again fallen  a victim to Briggs' evil passions? What fate had she to expect? It was so pitchy dark she could see nothing of the room in which she wm imprisoned. She did not even know whether she was alone or not. For some moments she feared to move but after a short time she stepped tim- orously forward. , Frightened apd iesparing, dreading   the worstr she called aloud for help; but the echo of her own voice was the sole response to her appeals. Her   suppliant  voice resounded through the house, but reached no pity. mig ear. Tired out at last, she threw herself upon the floor, and sobbed as if her poor little heart would break. What could she do T She was quite powerless, her cries were unheeded, her strength was ex- hausted, and she was in the power of some unprincipled ruffian, who had, without doubt, taken every precantion to render her escape an impossibility. How could she, a poor, weak girl, hope to struggle against her adversaries? 'The escape she had had the previous night was little short of miraculous. Fortune would not again favor her as it had done before. It would have moved a hard heart to see the poor suffering one prone upon the ground, her graceful form shaken by the sobs which could not be sur- pressed, as the knowledge of what might be her fate almost drove her dis- tracted. It seemed to her that she had been confined for hours in the dark room, when a faint light shone through the cracks of the door, and the sound of whispering struck upon her ears Instinctively she rose and gathered the cloak closer aboi '; her. With compressed lips and fixed deter- mination, she waited the entrance of those she heard without. Her heart beat so that she could scarcely breathe, and her eyes were fixed despairingly upon the door. Her bosom heaved convulsively, for she knew the time had come. The key was turned in the lock. There was another pause, and a short, whipered conference, during which she remained perfectly quiet, breathless with expectation and fear, longing, yet dreading, to see the form of her ab- dutor. She half expected that the cold sneer- ing face of Mr. Briggs would meet her gaze. She shuddered at the idea of the dia- bolical expression of triumnph which would light up his handsome features on seeing her once again in his power. She could think of no one but him who would have carried her focibly away. It surely rngt be his face she thought,   which would meet her eyes when the door was opened. But she was wrong. Slowly the door opened, admitting a stream of light which quite dazzled Rose, who sad been so long in the black darkness, and gave admission to man. Was it Briggs? A moments glance was sufficient to show her the fears she had entertained of that mysterious man were for the present groundless; at the same time the light revealed to her the fact that the room- was well, even handsomely furnished. He who now entered the apartment in which she had been kept a prisoner was a younger man, and his face was unadorned by a moustache. Another glance showed her that he was no other than the man who had sat by the man's side, and who had forcibly carried her into the house. Behind him, bearing a candle, came- a woman of singularly repulsive ap- pearance. It was not so much her ugliness as a remarkably sinister expression which made her face disagreeable to look upon, Still the sight of one of her own sex filled poor Rose with delight. Hope revived in her bosom; rushing past the man, she threw herself at the feet of his companion, and raised her hands in an attitude of supplication. "Have pity on me!" she cried, "have pity on me, and help me!" CHAPTER    VIL Among all those with whom    Mr. Briggs was acquainted there was hard- ly one who knew more of him than that he was rich, handsome and liberal. He never courted intimacy with any of his associates. He would converse with them upon ordinary topics, but any questions res- pecting himself, his birth, his parent- age, or the source of his income invari- ably remained unanswered; nay, more, the questioner received some severe re- buke which had the effect of restrain- ing him from again uttering his queries. It was in his chambers  in White street that Mr. Briggs was in the habit of entertaining his friends, and not at the lonely house to which Rose had been taken by him on the nigllht of her 'tirst appe a rane at the theatre.  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6980-00000016"/> Respecting that establishment he was ever silent. Until lhe made the acquaintance of young Jesse Dumar he had never asked one of his male friends to that lonely house, but, for reasons satisfactory to himself, he pressed that young fellow, who was little more than a youth, but who was blessed with a profusion of wealth, and a wonderful capacity for enjoying it, to accompany him to that residence and pass a few days with him. I-onw their days and evenings were spent in thlat lonely house it is better not to inquire. Every luxury, every dissipation, every enjoyment which the human mind could conceive and money purchase was to )e hlad there. Vicious pleasures and hideous orgies helpled to pass the hours till they seem- ed to fly, nor was the compatratively in- notcent excitement of gambling wIant- ing. Jesse Dumalr, thoughl te guest of Mr. Brirs, wa:s patying heavily ror his ainuse1enth s. A weekl qllickly passed by in every Lkilnd oft pleasure. At the end of tlhat time Briggs an- nou)ll-ce(d1 to Iris young friiend tlhat he was comlllpctl  to alsellt llimself for a few days ulpon urgent business. "I Ilust positively go, my dear fel- loNw%," he srid, "but I beg you to remain till my return. Treat everything as if it were your ow\n.  Do what you like. Go where you like-at least with one exception." "Whlat is that?" asked young Du- 5 mar. "Only a foolish wlhim of mine; but the furtlher portion of the house-thlat which is alwaa\-ys shut up-do not let your curiosity temlpt you thither." "Why not!" ashed otler, laughing. "Because I am master of the house f and I do not choose it," rejoined Briggs, his brow contractinjg as he spoke; but  in a moment his face brightened and he c rattled on in his usual gay and cheerful manner. Jesse Dumar, who was not without a t1 kind of fear of his entertainer, said no st more on that subject, and later in the p day Briggs left the house in a  close tl travelling carriage.        O A  week's incessant dissipation had al not been without its effect upon Dumar for pleasure will pall upon a iman, how- nl ever devoted lie may be in his pursuit w of it, and he felt but little inclination pi   ts for the excesses in which he and Briggfs had indulged together. Lf  Listlessly he strolled from the house d into the park-like grounds which sur- y rounded it, and lightink a cigar paced o slowly up and down upsol the lawn. ,  After a while his eyes rested on that :t portion of the house which Mr. BriggR ff lind cautioned him not to enter. r  It was a projecting wing, older and in t a dilapidated condition than the other i. portion of the building. e  It consisted only of two floors, the r windows of the upper one beilg closed with shutters, while the lower portion w as out of order and overgrown witlh d ivy as at once to proclaim it unin- h3 abited. "' It's deuced queer," said young Dumar. 1 "I don't understand it; Of course, as Briggs doesn't wish it, I won't go in; but there's no harm in stepping up and look. ing at the place outside." He suited the action to the words, but there was nothing to be seen. The windows of the ground floor came down so low that he could easily see in, rbut the rooms merely contained heaps of dust-covered lumber, and did not appear to have been -enteredtfor years. As he turned to retrace his steps he be- came conscious that one of the gardners was intently watching his movements. "Hang the fellow!" said Dumar pettish- ly. "Briggs needn't have set spies to watch me. Of course I'm not going in; but I should like to know what he's got locked up there." The fact was, the young fellow's cu- riosity was roused, and, in spite of all his host bhad said, he endeavored the follow- ing day to find out something connected with the mysterious wing, though without transgressing the host's command. For this purpose he tried to follow a long passage which, from his knowledge of the house, he knew must lead to the forbidden part. After a while his progress was stayed by a door which blocked up the end of the corridor. Suddenly as he stood it opened. He caught one momentary glance and  that showtd him, to his surprise, that the seemingly ordinary door was thickly plated with iron on the inner side, and that, moreover it possessed a complication of fastenings in the way of bolts, bars of steel, and massive chains. :"C What do you want here?" asked the man whol had coare from  the mysterious wins, in a griff, surly tone, at the same time puf&amp;g, his Ihand into his breast.   Dumar fancied as he did so that- he saw it grasp the butt-end of a pistol. Faintly he stammered an apology, and ; the owner of the gruff voice conducted him * back along the passage, muttering a caution to him not to wander about the parts of the house he didn't know. ; "For the fear of accidents," said the man ;with peculiar emphasis, again putting his hIand into his breast, "for fear of accidents, vo,',l better not come this way again." Edgar took the hint, and was not sorry to regain the inhabited portion of the house. Two days passed, and Brings had not re- turned, and his young guest was beginning to feel somewhat dull and tired. ; Pleasure was dull and insipid without his host to share it with'him, and the mystery of j the closed wing still dwelt upon his mind- ! and worried him with a restless curiosity to i unravel it. It was a fine, bright nighllt, and Jesse Du- mar had just finished his dinner. So bright and clear was it that he was tempted forth into the grounds to smoke his digestive cigar. Wandering about, his steps brought him within sight of the closed wing, when, to his surprise, he perceived that the shutters of one of the windows were open, and that a bright light from the interior shone through. It was plain that the building was in- habited. But who were its occupants? He lit a second cigar as he lent against a wall and wondered. He was idle and curious. Was there no way in which, he could sat- tify his curiosity?  Yes. In looking round, his eyes rested upon a hort ladder. The window  from which the light shown i was at no great distance from the ground.  Surely he might, without muclh risk, climb t by its aid and peep into that secret upper t floor. He resolved to make the attemp.    c Planting the ladder firmly, but noiselessly, S he slowly and cautiously ascended till his j head was on a level with the window-sill. Then, scarcely daring to breathei he peer- r ed into the room. It was a  small room in which he looked, and totally devoid of furniture. The light which streamed through the W window came from a  powerful lamp placed upon a  broad shelf, a few feet from the floor. Upon this shelf were several different-sized  brackets, and that was all. The room was untenanted.   it IDumar was puzzled, but his curiosity was till further aroused. d  What was the meaning of this mystery? m  Why was he warned not to enter so very In ordinary a rooml? e  It was no dismal, ghastly, Blue-Beard chamber after all. a,  Still there might be more, if he could but is obtain an entrance into the chamber, he s, thought.  Stealthily he placed his hand upon the to window frame and pushed it upward, To his surprise, it yielded to his touch 3- and opened noiselessly, and in a few 'mo. g ments he was standing in the room. He was actually in the mysterious wing s itself. f ' The thought of having'acted dishonorably d- to his host never occurred to him, so full o was his mind of unravelling the mystery. On tiptoe he crossed the floor where the ' - lamp stood on the shelf. Stooping down he examined the pack- s ets which lay about. 5 Money-money--money! They all contained money. n  Some bank notes, some  gold, some sil s ver. f  Bright new gold and silver coins, crisp X white bank notes. Dumar took   up another packet and dropped it with a cry of horror, for he saw that it contained false coin. Yes, it was all false. The bank notes were forgeries. The gold was of base metaL Mr. Briggs was a coiner. With white face, he would have turned and retraced his steps, but an iron hand restrainee him. A grip was on his collar. The cold muzzle of a pistol touched his forehead. Tremblingly he raised his eyes and met the fierce stern gaze of the host, for it was he who held him. At the window and at the door were crowded many rough, ragged-bearded, savage faces, all glaring menacingly at Jesse Dumar. "Spare me!   cried the youth, implo- ringly.  "Not a  word " said Briggs. - "Come with me. - With the -pistol still at-his forehead, with the iron grasp still on his neck, he quitted the room, preceded by the g ing of coiners, and followed by Briggs, who never relaxed his hold. He was about to reap the punishment of his foolish curioUsity.  &#xD;<pb n="32 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6980-00000017"/> CHAPTER IX. "HAVE pity on me!" cried Rose, as she knelt at the woman's feet. "Have pity on me, and help me!" As she looked up with tearful eyes into that woman's face, she saw no pity there. A cold, heartless sneer and a cruel stare met her suppliant looks. A harsh laugh answered her entreaty. "Ol! are you a woman, and without compassion for one of your own sex?" cried Rose, passionately. '"Can you stand calnly by and see me ill-treated? No, no I I cannot-will not believe it. You will save me  You will rescue me?" In the energy of despair the poor girl clutched at the skirt the woman wore, and held it in her grasp. Impatiently the other jerked it from her hand and turned aside. "* What have I ever done," continued Rose, " that these indignities should be heaped upon me? Is it because I am a poor, friendless girl? Is-it because of my defenceless position? Let me go! I pray you let me go! I will bless you for your goodness if you will but let me go." The woman laughed again, a hard and cruel laugth. Thie mlan turned and gazed upon the figure of the suppliant girl. "We cannot-dare not suffer you to escape." "Oh, think what it is for me!" said Rose. "Why am I kept here? Whose doing is it? Do you know that my de- tention hlere, if it be only a cruel jest, will delprive me of my livelihood?" "You'll be well taken care of, my beauty," said the woman, in a harsh, jeering tone; " you shan't want for anything." "How long do you intend to keep me here?" "That's as may be. We cage our birds till they are so'tame that they do not care to fly away." "I will not stay," cried Rose. "It is a shame. You dare not detain me!" She rose to her feet and made for the door, which still stood open; but the woman stretched forth a long, bony arm and grasped her shoulder. "Not so fast. little one! You don't leave us like that." With a vigorous wrench, Rose freed herself from the hand that held her.   then covering her face, -ave wty to a burst of hysterical sobs. "It's an infernal shame," uttered the man. "What's a shamed " asked his com- panion, sharply. "What do   you mean?" "What I say," rejoined the other, sullenly. "It's an infernal shame, and Briggs is a villain " Rose heard the words and shuddered. Her worst fears were realised, and the man and woman were but agents of the hateful Briggs. "Idiot!" said the woman, with bit- ter contempt. "Is this a time for maud- lin compassion I Let the girl escape if you dare!" "I will have no more to do with the job. It is a blacker one ' I like." "Poor fellow!" rejoinul ..ie woman, sneeringly. "How long have you been so conscientious?" "You have no feeling." "Perhaps not." "I tell you it is an ugly business." "And 1 tell you I don't care if it is. What is it to us so long as we get paid for it?" "Money! money!  It is always money with you." "Of course. Have you come into a fortune, that you can afford to despise gold ." "I will have no more to do with the matter." "Fool! Suppose I say you shall?" "You? What can you do if I re- fuse?" "Oh, nothing-nothing. 1 Woanonly remember." "Remember what f" "Remember when your conscience did not trouble you so much-when one dark night a deed was done in this very room which -" "Hush! Hash  For Heaven's sake, be silent." "Oh, then you remember it! That is well. Now at your peril let this pale-faced girl escape. I say at your peril." Repeating the words menacingly, she left the room, and Rose, who in an agony of fright had listened tremblingly to the conversation, cast an appealing look towards the man. His back was turned to her. Rose cast herself on her knees before him. He turned and confronted her.   ROSE CARRIED OFF BY AMR.

He was not much more than twenty, and had -some pretensions to- wards being a gentleman; but he was evidently a blackguard. Evidently; he, possessed a low; and vicious mind, which showeditself in the expression of his face as he, carelessly lounged there against the mantel-piece, smoking his enormous cigar.

"   -- For a moment he paused, seemingly ' irresolute; then, with a savage oath, he pushed her from him With such force 'that she sank heavily on the floor. He tunried aside, ashamed. When Rose raised her head she saw that his back was towards her. She saw, moreover, that the dooir was still open. Possessed of a sudden hope of making her escape', she sprang to her feet, and almost before he had -time to turn his heia had disappeared through the door- way.  With a savage yell he darted after her.  On quitting the room she, in her con- fusion, turned to the left instead of the right. She did not perceive her mistake until too late. To retrace her steps was but to run into the arms of her pursuer.   Her only . . ... .. A staircase terminated the' plassage, and up this she ran, the man gaining rapidly upon her. Up, up she went, knowing no whither it might lead. On, on, came her pursuer, calling to her in vain to stop. But the stairs could not go on for- ever, She reached the uppermost floor o0 the house. What could she do t She had but a moment for deliberation. The door of a room stood open, and into it she darted, but what protection could it afford her? None! it was a bare, meagre, unfu r- nished attic. One chance alone remained-the win dow!   - It stood open, and outside raul a nar- row parapet. Without pausing she stepped upon it, and hurried along the narrow ledge. Her pursuer entered the room is -she did so, -and uttered a cry of horror; for he deemed it impossible for her to escape a dreadful death. He expected she would fill, to be dashed in pieces on the pavement below; and his- fear was not without founda- tion. The ledge was..little. more than eight inches wide! .

To effect her escape she would have to crawl along for some distance upon  the slates, and then drop a considerable distance upon a tiled roof, which was so sloping as to give her but little chance c*f being able to retain her footing when she reaclled it. She did not hesitate for a moment. Any fate was preferable to the one she might expect should she fall into the clutches of her persecutor. She knew no mercy was to be expect- ed at his hands. Her pursuer, who had feared to fol- low her along the parapet, had stretch- ed himself as far as possible out from the window, expecting every moment to see her fall in the street below, but yet intently watching her movements. That she would attempt to escape by dropping on the lower roof never enter- ed his head. The plan seemed to be impracticable. It was certain death, he thought. The danger was extreme, but Rose determined to brave it. Anything rather than the fate for which he had destined her. When the man saw her commence to crawl slowly and carefully along the slated roof, he uttered a cry of horror. To call to her, to warn her, was of no use. She was too far from him to hear him, unless he raised his voice so that it would be audible to any passer-by in the street below. He watched her till a stack of chim- neys hid her from his sight. For some moments he remained breathless, expecting every instant to hear the shriek of despair announcing her fall. He waited, but he heard it not. The suspense became intolerable. The beauty and innocence of poor Rose had not been without its effect upon him. Her peril roused the nobler sentiments in his nature. Snatching up a coil of rope, and   hanging it loosely about his neck, he crept through the window. Then, upon his hands and knees, he crawled along the' ledge. It was a dangerous undertaking. One moment's loss of confidence, one second's giddiness, and he might be dashed to pieces on the pavement. Still he persevered. He had changed his boots for a pair of slippers when he had entered the house. Now throwing these off, his stockinged feet lent him increased se- curity in his perilous enterprise. Looling steadily before him, he crawl- ed on and on till he reached the cor- ner. Then he paused and looked around for the object of his pursuit. She was nowhere to be seen. Had she found some other method of making her escape? Puzzled, he waited, and scanned the roof carefully. Then, by the bright moonlight, he saw at some distance from him the poor girl in the act of dropping from the higher to the lower roof. 4 She had gone further up, in order that, should she miss her footing, she might have a better chance of recover- ing it. The tiles upon which she was about to drop were at such an acute angle that it seemed all but impossible that she could retain her balance upon them. As he watched, she let go her hold of the edge of the upper, and dropped on the lower roof. With breathless interest he rivetedhis gaze upon the poor girl. She alighted on her feet, but was Un- able to retain her balance for more than a moment. Her feet slipped from under her, and she glided qulckly towards destruction. He turned ashy pale and gasped for breath. It was a fearful sight to see this fair young girl hurrying to her death-to know that no mortal power could save her-to know, moreover, that he would be indirectly the cause of her fearful death. As she slipped and glided over the steep roof, now staying her course for a sec- ond by clutching at the tiles, only to start again when she could no longer hold them-sometimes almost sucoed-   ing in stag1- er . ng. to her fieet--then again slipping, falling, and gliding, all the while approaching every moment near- er to the edge, over which she must be carried, to fall down-down-to the level of the street, to bL taken up a bruised, mutilated, uiNrecognisable corpse. She was already within a few feet of the edge. She uttered one wild despairing shriek which rang like a death-knell -in the ears of the man who had driven her to Attempt the rash act. Shuddering, he turned away his head. He could not bear to look upon the eight. He listened for the dull, heavy thud of the fallen body in the street below, but he heard it not. Then lie directed his timorous glance to the roof below him. Poor Rose had grasped at a leaqen waterpipe, and had seized it eagerly. With the tenacity of one who strug- gles against death she held it. It was but a precarious safety. Any moment the pipe might give way, and then nothing could save her. She was so near the edge of the roof that her feet rested against the little ridge that terminated it. This afforded her some little extra support; but already the water pipe bulged, so that it seemed impossible it could not long withhold her from the dreadful fate. Hope that she might be rescued re- rived in the bosom of the man whose conduct, though he was but the agent of another, had brought her into her pres- ent position. He crawled further along the higher roof till he was immediately over the spot where Rose hung, as it were, be- tween life and death. "Have courage," he said, " and I will save you." "Never!" answered Rose. "Sooner would I face the most terrible death than return to that hateful house." "For Heaven's sake do not be so rash." '"Death is preferable to dishonor." "See; I have a rope here- by which- I can draw you up to comparative secu- rity. Do not -sacrifice your life for a fancy." -"I tell you I know the man," said she, " and sooner than fall into his hands I would submit to any fate," "Your strength cannot hold out much   longer," cried the man, eagerly. - It is suicide if you persist in your resolu- tion;" "Better suicide than the lot which awaits me if I fall into your hands." "No-no! You wrong me. You shall go in peace." "I cannot trust you." "I swear it." "What is an oath to a man like you?" "Save yourself, I implore you! See; here I make'a running knot at the end of the rope, and throw it to you." He suited the action to the word. "Now, then, before your strength is exhausted, slip it under your arms-one at a time-that's right-cling to the pipe with the other hand-well managed! Now you are saved." "Come, come. There is no time to be lost." Holding the end of the rope between his teeth, he crawled to a place where a stack of chimneys gave him a firmer foothold, and then, by means of the rope, raised Rose to the left of the r oof on which he stood. Poor girl! By the time she reached it she was completely exhausted. The man assisted her, almost fainting, to a position of security, though not without cor:sid 'table risk to himself. With pall,its A ng heart, heaving bosom and quivering limbs, she rested. It was some time before she recovered her composure sufficiently to attempt to crawl back along the narrow ledge. And no wonder. All she had gone through would have severely tried the nerves and muscles of a strong man; how much the more, then, those of a poor, weak girl? It took a long time to reach again the window through which she had made her escape, with a heart buoyed up with a hope of deliverance. Now she returned to it, weakened, bruised, and again in the hands of her persecutors, with nothing but the word of a ruffian that she should be free to depart. After a while the two once more stood within the wa"s of the house to which she had been taken in the coach by the myrmidons of Brigge. Once again in the room, the man seemed little disposed to fulfil his promise of liberating Rose. He stood in the doorway, blocking it up, completely preventing the egress of any person.  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6980-00000020"/> "Let me go," cried Rose; " remem- ber your promise." "Ay, ay; we will talk of that pre- sently." "What do you mean t Oh, say you have not deceived me! Remember the oath you swore." "All in good time, my pretty one; all in good time; you must need rest and refreshment after all you have gone through." "I will not rest! I will not touch a morsel in this house!" cried Rose, angrily. "Don't say that, my beauty," an- swered the man, with a laugh; "be- cause I can compel you! However, as you know, I am not hard-hearted. Do you think I am!" Rose made no answer. "You're the prettiest girl I have seen for many a long day, and that's a fact; and I'm infernally glad you're safe and sound, though you wouldn't have been but for me. You haven't thanked me me yet." t"I have nothing to thank you for," answered Rose, striving to speak calmly, ' if you keep me prisoner here." Then, her voice breaking down, her tone changed to one of wild supplica- tion. "Oh, let me go, I beg of you! Why should you keep me here? Oh, set me free!" "All in good time. You shouldn't be in such a hurry to leave your friends. Besides, those pretty lips must pay a teoll first." He endeavored as he spoke to put an arm round Rose's slender waist, but she repulsed him indignantly. "Take care," said he, with an angry gleam in his eyes; " you seem to forget that I am lord and master just now, and that you are completely in my power." Rose knew it and trembled. Should she fail in conciliating him he might refuse to set her at liberty. "Don't you understand," continued the ruffian, " that I don't mean to take all the risk and trouble of letting you go without my reward V" "What do you want t" asked Rose, her voice trembling so that she was scarcely intelligible; ". what do you mean " t"Mean that I love you, my pretty one." "Let me go, let me go!" she cried, frantically pushing towards the door.   The man caught her in his arms and held her fast. "Listen to me," he said. "I not only can liberate you now, but prevent you ever experiencing any annoyance from Briggs again. I can do this-and will, on one condition." "And that is-" "That you remain here with me. We could have a jolly time of it. I know how to get some money out of Briggs, and--" Rose pushed him from her and turned a look of scorn upon him. "How dare you say such words? Keep your oath and let me go in peace, or-" "Or what?" sneered the man. "Or it will be the worse for you. I will not stop. You dare not keep me." "We'll see about that," said the man. Catching her up in his arms, despite of her struggles, he bore her to another room, ind then, setting her down, locked the door and put the key in his pocket. CHAPTER X. THROUGH a narrow passage was Jesse Dumar led by Briggs, the pistol all the while pointed at his head. A thousand times he cursed himself for his foolish curiosity A thousand times he reproached him- self for what he had done. Had he but obeyed his host's com- mand he might have been seated in a sumptuously furnished apartment, with everything which money could pur- chase to be had for thie asking, instead of being surrounded by a gang of ruf- fians, and in danger of his life. What were they going to -do wi th him I There were many ominous whisper- ings amongst the men. Would his life be sacrificed t He looked up appealingly at Briggs, but his head was turned away from him. He spoke, and instantly a handker- chief was tied securely over his mouth. A few moments in the passage, and their further progress was barred by a heavy door. One of the party unlocked it, and Jesse saw that it was lined with iron and secured in a similar manner to the one which led from the mysterious   wing into the inhabited portion of the house. In silence he was conducted into a large room, which was lighted by a number of oil lamps placed on brackets around it. The apartment was destitute of furni- ture, but was filled in a great measure by machinery. Presses, stamping machines, and others of which he was at a loss to define the use were arranged about, and all apparently in the best working order. A clear s pace was left in the centre of the chamber, and thither Briggs con- ducted his guest. At a signal a heavy trap in the floor was lifted so close to Jesse's feet as to make him start back in fear. It disclosed a black, yawning chasm, which appeared to be bottomless. Still a deathke silence prevailed. It was not broken till Briggs spoke. "Comrades," said he, "we have a, law that every spy upon us dies; we play too desperate a game to run the chances of detection." Jesse shuddered. He saw the reason the trap had been opened. Peering into the blackness of that abyss he saw his grave. He, a young man full of life and hope and energy, felt that in a few short minutes he would be a lifeless mass, a shapeless, nameless thing. No wonder that he shuddered. No wonder that an icy chill crept through his frame. There are few men so brave as to re- main unmoved when suddenly brought face-to-face with death. He strove to beg for mercy; but the bandage about his mouth was too tight- ly fastened. A low murmur, and that was all. i"Say," said Briggs, " what is to be the spy's fate?" "Death!" answered all the men. The tone in which they spoke was low, but it was none the less determined for that.  Jesse glanced around appealingly, lbut not one face did he see with a ex- m jression of pity upon it.     ] He could expect no mercy      1 He had been found prying into that in which he had no concern.     ] He possessed a secret which, were he -it liberty, would give him a power over 1 all the gang, which it was not likely ] they would suffer him to make use of. S   They were judge, jury and execution ers. His fate was sealed. Still he could hardly think that James Briggs-he by whose side he had re- cently sat, Who had treated him as his honored guest-would sanction his mur- der in cold blood. Briggs's face was still averted. Jesse could not speak, but, as a last resource, he threw himself on his knees and raised his hands imploringly. Briggs lowered the muzzle of his pis- tol. A murmur of disapprobation went through the gang. "What does this mean?" cried their leader, fiercely. "Am I not chief here? By what right do you dispute my will?" "Our law says ' Death to Spies.' Let him die," answered one of the men sur- lily. ' If I choose to spare this man's life, I am answerable. It is my business." "And ours also. Our risk is equal with yours." "So be it," said Briggs. Again he raised his pistol and pointed it at the head of Dumar. Jesse firmly believed- his last moment had come. Involuntarily he closed his eyes. "Wait!" said Briggs. "I have a plan to propose." "No-no! Let him die," cried one. "Why should he be spared"' said another. "Death by   our laws," muttered a third. "' You speak like fools," said Briggs, angrily. To Dumar the agony of suspense was terrible. He knew not what might be his fate. Briggs seemed disposed to spare his life, but the gang of ruffians thirsted for his blood. Life was dear to him-he never knew how dear till then, He longed for the power of speech to plead his own cause. He was prepared to take the most solemn oath never to reveal that whicn he had seen, but he had not the oppor- tunity to do so. When next Briggs spoke, it was in a low, calm voice. "Comrades, I know as well as you, do that this spy deserves death at our hands, but, for all that, I propose to spare him."     -    ^  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6980-00000021"/> "No, no i" t Ilear what I have to say." ' Ay, ay, we will hear you, but even  can't talk us out of the rules and laws we have made.'  "I don't wish to. The law was made and still holds good. But still there may he occasions in which it is better to depart from it." "I'm blowed if I can see it." "In the first place this man was my friend-" "That's nothing to do with us. It's no business of ours." "In the second," continued Briggs, not heeding the interruption, " he has powerful friends and  relations, who will move heaven and earth to discover the cause of his disappearance." '"They'll never look there for him," said one, with a diabolical grin, point- ing down through the gaping trap. "They will look everywhere," replied Briggs.  He was known to be staying with me, and how am I to account for his disappearance?" "There's something in that." "Suppose we spare his life, what proof have we that he will not betray us Amp Dumar strove to express his determi- nation to reveal nothing of what he had seen and heard. "' I have still more to say," continued Briggs. "This spy has several high and influential relations and moves in the best circles of society." "Well, what then t" "He may be of great use to us. Should suspicion fall upon us at any time, he might help to divert it. Be- sides, he could be of the greatest as- sistance in helping us to dispose of our -our manufactures." ^ He wouldn t do it." "If he refuses he must die." "What security have we that he will keep faith with us P" "The best. But let us question him." The men murmured, and showed un- mistakable signs of discontent. Briggs laid his hand on the handker- hief which bound Dumar's mouth. At the same time he spoke impres- ively.             / "Remember," said he, Kin thus giv- ing you liberty of speech, that a single attempt at escape, and you die! Re- member 1" So saying, he removed the bandage and Jesse Dumar heaved a sigh of relief.   E  1  I al V A.. "You have heard all that has been said!" asked Briggs of the young man. !"Yes." ' -Are you prepared to take a solemn oath never to reveal to mortal ear what you have seen and heard this night?" "I am.!"  "That is well, but it is not all. You must do more than that." "I will do anything in my power if you will but spare my life," said Jesse. "Deeds, not words, are what we re- quire. Not only must you swear this, but you must also join us- you must become one of us." "4 Become a-a-" stammered Jesse. "Yes! Become a forger, a coiner, a maker of counterfeit money-whatever you like to call it.' Dumar made no answer. "i No hesitation," said Briggs, sternly, at the samue time raising his pistol. "Yes or no! Life or death!" "Shall H?" "No questions. Will you join us? Answer or take the consequences." "I will join you." "That is well." Turning to the gang standing around, who had not scrupled to show signs of dissatisfaction during this conversation, I Briggs addressed them. "Now, my friends, are you satisfied?" "No, no!" X "Why not!" I He will betray us. "What makes you think so?' "' Because he is forced to join us. He will back out of it as soon as you set r him at liberty." 'No!" said Jesse Dumar, energetic- ally. "I will never forfeit my word."' "Bravely spoken!" said Briggs, ap- provingly. "1 But, just show to these gentlemen that you mean what you say; suppose you inspect this pretty 1 little machine." As lie spoke he rested his hands on a ' complication of wheels and levers which - stood near him. Almost mechanically Dumar took up his position in the place pointed out bIy his host a few hours since. "You see I have here," said Briggs, "several medals made of a metal close- , ly resembling silver, but with a perfect- e ly plain surface. I put one into this  machine and turn the handle-so. You understand?" e  "Yes," said Dumar, in a low top of If voice. d"The medal, you see, falls out le   and has impressed upon the surfice"a correct image of the head of liberty, as on a twenty dollar gold piece. Do you think you could manage to work that machine?"  Dumar made no answer. "At all events you must try." Conscious that the least wavering mighlt be his death warrant, Dumar did as he' was bid; and 'after one or two unsuccessful- attempts, succeeded in stamping one of the medals properly. Then Briggs bade him insert the base coin into anuother machine by which thie reverse side, an eagle, was stamped; and then jinto a third for milling the edges. All this he did, the gang of coiners gathered round him the while, scowling- ly watching every movement he made. A dozen counterfeit gold pieces were made by Dumar before Briggs allowed him a minute's rest. "That will do for the present," said he, as Jesse turned out his twelfth base coin.  Then turning to his gang, he spokb to them. "This worthy young man, you now see, is completely one,of us; Now if he betrays you he betrays himself, for he has made false coin of his own friee Will, and is as much :a coiner as any onbe of you. Afe you satisfied?"  The answers were divided, some not thinking the test sufficient. "One thing more you must do," said Briggs, turning again to Jesse. "( What is that V" "Those packets you see yonder are all base coin or forged notes, and are about to be sent to our country agents. Yonder is a pen and ink. You must di- rect them."  The consciousness of being powerless made Dumar do as he was bid. "In your usual handwriting, if, youn please," added Briggs. "If you try. to disguise it, it may cost you your life." At Briggs' dictation Jesse wrote the directions. "Now, comrades, you must surely be satisfied. We have his writing as wit- ness against him. What more do you want?" "Nothing-nothing." "That is well. Welcome him amongst you as your companion. Take care of him, and instruct him in his work." So saying, Briggs quitted -the room, leaving Dumar to the mercies of the   , ruffians who had thirsted for his blood. i - It was not till the trap in the centre t! of the room had been closed and bolted, thatk Jesse felt really safe. When that was done he heaved a deep sigh of relief at his unexpected escape from the very jaws of death. l But at what a cost had his life been purchased!            .  Not only had he become a, criminal in' I the eyes-of the law, but he had put 'ims- self completely in the power of a gang of ruffians, who would not seruple to use any mneans of quieting .him, should he in any way make himself dangerous or disagreeable to them. Fdr several hours Dumar was kept hard at'- work.     .' It was the first time in hislife tlhat he had ever exeited himself except for his owna amusement.  ' But now it was real hard work which fell to his lot.  Work from which there was no flinch- ing. Work which there was no shirking. As nearly as he could calculate, it must have been near daylight when one of the men, whose dress bore some re- semblance to that of a mtliodistparson, and who:was called Samuel Heath by the bthers, and appeared to bo a sort of a foreman or overseer, gave signal to discontinue work.        - In a very few minutes the machine became quiet.     - " The couinterfeit coin was carried away carefully to another room. Then the gang of coiners passed one by one from the apartment- till at last one other besides Dumar remained in it. With' a loud clang the .iron-plated door was closed and the key turned in the lock.            ' " Jesse and the other one were prison- ers.           -    " The man'who had been chosen to share Dumar's captivity was past mid- dle age, and appeared to be of a sullen- and morose disposition. No sooner Wtas the door fastened than he laid -himself down upon the floor, and, curlingrouid,; dormouse-like, closed his eyes as if for sleep. But Jesse would not allow him to re- main unquestioned. His curiosity, which had led him into his present position, and nearly cost him his life, was not yet satisfied. "Are we prisoners?"' le asked,  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6980-00000022"/> "It looks libe it, don't it?" rejoined the other, surlily. "You may get out it you can." "How long are we to remain here?" ' Till we are let out." ' When will that be?" "'When Briggs pleases." "But we shall be starved." "Not a bit of it. We shall have pleanty to eat." "What are you here for? To guard me?" "Not a bit of of it. The bolts and bars will keep you much securer than I could." "Then you are a prisoner too?" "Hang it all! Can't you see that? What's the good of questioning me? Hero have I been this ever so long beat- ing against those infernal bars, plotting, planning, scheming, but all to no pur- pose." "qPhen you're not one of the gang t" 4"Yes I am." 4' Then how is it-" "Now look here, I'm a-going to sleep, aud ain't going to answer any more questions; so you mayjust as well shut up." "But just tell me one thing." ( I won't! I'm blessed if I will!" "This James Briggs-is he a friend of yours t" The question seemed to rouse the man into a perfect frenzy. "A friend! A friend of mine! He's ruined me; he's shot at me; I carry a bullet in my leg now, fired by his di- rection; he has pulled me from my home; he has insulted my daughter! Curses light upon him! My friend! Ha; ha!" "Who are you then t What is your name,?" "What does that matter?" "What shall I call you t" ("Call me Hugh Seymour!" Though Jesse asked other questions, hoe received no answer to them. His fellow-prisoner was, or pretended to be, fast asleep. Dumar strove to follow his example. He, n whose limbs had never hitherto pressed aught but the softest linen, lay down upon the bare boards, cold, tired, and disheartened, to seek repose. But slumber would not come to his relief. He could not obtain a short oblivion of his woes in sleep. As he lay upon the floor, that which   he had done came upon him with full force. Be saw nothing but a wretched crim inal life before him. He was so completely mixed up with a gang of rnffians as to be inseparable from them. His prospects in life were blighted. He was altogether in the power of a set of unscrupulous men, who could and would force him to the commission of deeds from the bare thought of which he shrank in horror. He, who had ever associated with ladies and gentlemen, and had moved in the best society, was now leagued with a band of low, desperate, illiterate, ruffianly forgers. How could he ever face the world again? Would not the knowledge of what he really was press him down like a dead weight? With such thoughts as these crowd- ing through his mind, he fell into a restless and. uneasy slumber upon the hard floor of the mysterious chamber. CHAPTER XI. WHEN poor Rose found herself once more in her enemy's clutches she felt her heart sink within her. All life and energy seemed to die out of her frame. The excitement of her attempted escape had buoyed her up for a while, but when alone in her solitude of the dreary room a reaction took place. She could not weep. It was with a hard, stony glance she seated herself. Her eyes fixed, her limbs powerless, she fell into a species of trance. It was a strange, old-fashioned bed- room in which she was. All in it was dark and dismal. In one corner stood a large bedstead of carved oak, hung with heavy tapestry, and surmounted by plumes of feathers, which completed its resem- blance to a hearse. Some worn and tattered tapestry ,hung on one portion of the wall, but the greater part was panelled with the isame dark, almost black, wood of which the bed was made.  So much Rose saw by the pale moon- light; but the parts of the room away i from the windows were buried in such   ,. ,1m that her eyes could not pierce "energy had left her. k'ven the wish to escape was fainter. No; that she was now reconciled to the temn ble fate Briggs designed for her, but simply because life and energy had left her. Worn out, fatigued, tired, and almost heart-broken, she threw herself upon the bed and strove to sleep. Tired as she was, she could not keep her eyes shut. A strange fascination compelled her to watch the light thrown upon the chamber by the moon. From this light her excited imagina- tion formed many gaunt and fanciful designs. Sometimes to her heated brain it ap- peared as if a troop of ghosts came sweeping towards her. It was in vain she told herself it was but fancy. The illusion had taken such a deep hold of her mind that she could not bear to look in that direction. For relief she fixed her eyes upon the darkest corner of the room, steadfastly turning her gaze from the window. Was it still fancy? Surely in the pitchy blackness, where no ray of moonlight penetrated, she saw something white fluttering to and fro. Sometimes it seemed nearer to her, sometimes farther off, but still always present. Intently she watched it. With Ia horrid dread .she waited to see it take some definite form. With rivetted gaze, distended eyes, and powerless limbs she saw the white something  take the form  of a tall woman. Yet not the form of a woman of flesh and blood, but a horrifying, semi-trans- parent. luminous shadow, which noise- lessly flittered hither and thither. Rose uttered a tfaint cry of terror as this sight met her gaze. It was too dreadful. She shuddered and turned away her head. When next she ventured to look, the apparition had drawn nearer to her. Nearer and nearer it came, with silent, gliding motion. As it crossedl the streanm-ot moonlight which came in through the window, luos, sINaw its face.   I A hollow, cadaverous face, with eyes so deeply sunk as to be wholly in shade. Twice the figure threw its arms up 'wildly over its head, uttering a moan- ing cry. The second time it did so Rose saw that in one hand it brandished a long dagger. She had not strength to rise and fly from the approach of the ghostly being. It drew nearer and nearer. Every minute brought it closer to the bed. Rose could not move. She felt as if paralysed in every limb. Her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth. Her heart almost ceased to beat. Yet she could not move her eyes from that which was approaching her. On, still on, it glided, till it stood by the bedside! It stretched forth an arm,- and laid an icy hand, a cold, clammy, death-like hand, on Rose's bare shoulder. With the other hand it raised on high the glittering dagger, and again uttered the moaning cry. It was more than Rose in her feeble state could brave. With a faint cry she fell back fainting upon, the pillow. A stouter heart than hers might have, quailed  at such an apparition. No wonder that her poor feeble frame gave way beneath the shock. It was a swoon like unto death into which she fell. How long she remained unconscious she never knew, but after a time she opened her eyes. With fear and trembling she looked around, dreading that the dreadful thing might still be at her side. She saw it not. Gathering courage, she looked in every direction. It had gone! As far as the darkness would permit her to ascertain, she was alone in that haunted chamber. With faltering steps she walked across the room. Then she saw a sight which filled her with as much joy as the other had with horror. The door which she had seen shut and had heard locked, now stood open. Without pausing to think concerning  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6980-00000023"/> thl strangeness of the alteration, she plannedwn idea of escape. Could she but find her way to the street door and open it without noise, she might again be free. The thought of liberty-of escape from her dreadful fate gave her fresh courage and strength. She listened, but not a sound fell on her ear to tell that any one was in the house. Then, cautiously and timorously, she ventured out into the dark passage. Dreading the slightest sound, she crept along with fearful steps till she reached the staircase. Down, down she went, stopping every minute, scarcely daring to breathe, for fear that she might be discovered. At length, she reached a long passage in which a lamp burnt dimly. In an instant she recognized it. 1 It was the one through which she had run when attempting the escape which i so80 nearly ended in the loss of her life. She followed the whole length of the passage, and then to her joy reached i the door, now  securely bolted, whiohi  led into the street. Her fingers trembled so that she g could hardly pull back the fastenings, t but!t.: .somne little time she succeeded C in doing so without the least noise. h In another moment she stood in the street--once again at liberty! She could hardly believe how fortune I] had so far favored her as to let her es- I' cape a  second time from the clutches of fc Briggs.             t- Undiscovered she had passed through the house, let herself out, and now stood to iu the public thoroughfare.    h Then for the first time she remem- tu bered that she wore her theatrical cos- pi tume, and that to walk as she was through the streets was an impossibil- o0 ity.                th Keeping as much as possible in the shade, and shrinking away whenever she heard the sound of approaching footsteps, she reached at last a leading he thoroughfare.            M Hailing the first hack she saw, she entered it without having attracted any to attention by the singularity of her dress.               the She told the driver to take her to the ho Broadway Theatre. He stared hard at her, and then the mounted his box and started for Worth r street.              wil   he  When Rose told him to drive to the theatre she had not bestowed a thought he upon the lateness of the hour. get The theatres had been long closed, but it happened that at the Broadway Pe that night there had been an accident oh to one of the principal scenes which made it necessary fobr men to work at it mn throughout the night, in order that it he might be ready for the next representa- tion of the pantomime. e  As it happened, Mr. Colson had stop- ped to superintend the repairs, and lie le it was with whom Rose found herself e face-tonface as she entered the stage door in Worth street. 9   "Hullo!", cried Mr. Colson, who as 3, may readily be imagined was'not in the best of tempers, ', here's a pretty time, e to turn up, confound you'!"

Sadly she donned the clothes in which only two nights befbre she had entered the theatre so gay, buoyant and happy. Now she was cast adrift.. A waif upon the wide world. A human being without a friend to help her; for how-could she account to Mrs. Halliday fobr her absence? Would she believe the story she had to tell? Again entering the hack, she told the man to drive to Mrs. Halliday's house. She  was evidently not expected there. There was not a light in any of the windows.   ?be got out of the hack and knocked. iFor a long time no attention was paid j to t le summons. i  t length, the door opened as far as I the chain would allow, and Mrs. Halli- i dday's head, surmounted by a nightcap, : appeared.  "Won't you let me in, Mrs. Halli- day?" asked Rose. B Nio." She answered her sharply, and with ideetermination. "OIh! what have I done? Tell me how I have offended you." "I won't have such goings on in my house," said Mrs. Halliday.  "You've brought it all on by your own unre- speetable conduct." This was more than Rose could bear. The insult, added to all she had gone through that night, made life almost in- supportable. She would have answered the old lady, but the door was violently slam- med to, and Rose was standing on the pavement, houseless, friendless, penni- less. "P'raps, if you don't want to go no furder, miss, you'll pay me my fare." "I have no money," said Rose. "Oh, gammon! Come, none of that game!" "* Indeed, I have nothing.". "Well, look here, you've got a ring, or a watch, or something." Rose. had in truth a small locket, which she had always guarded with the most jealous care, and ever hid from her father's eyes. It had been her mother's. Now there was no help for it. Money she must have, and in no-; other way than by the sale of the trink-  et could she obtain it. "You'll excuse me, miss, but a highly respectable, friend of mine who lives close by would, I'm sure, give you a . good price for anything you wished to sell." "Take me to him," said Rose. "His name is Aaron Hass, miss, and I he's got a daughter called Miriam, or  some  such outlandish thing, but he's s very respectable," said the hackman. Though Aaron Hass, the Jew, might; have been respectable, it was a queer neighborhood in which he had chhosen 1 to pitch his tent.   I Rose shrank from entering the dark, close-smelling shop, but the hackman s urged her forward.         j   She was without money, and until she could satisfy the man's claim she was in his power.       / An old man came- from the 'back of the shop as Rose entered, bringing with him a powerful odor of new rum and stale tobacco., "What can I do for you, my dear?" he asked of poor Rose, eyeing her with. a disgusting leer as he spoke. Tremblingly the poor girl produced the locket. In faltering accents she offered it for sale. The locket was of some value, being: gold, set with pearls. The old Jew scrutinised it earnestly.  "Come in here," said he to Rose, pointing to the back, shop, " conme in here; while I examine it closer." She hesitated, but no other course, seemed open to her than to obey him. "Now," said he, closing the door after she had entered, " now you had&amp; betterconfess at once.: Whose is this. locket?    , "Mine," Rose answered, indignantly; for. there was that in Aaron Hass' tone, she did not like. '"Do you suppose I stole it?" The Jew chuckled cunningly at her answer. "I'msure you did." Rose staggered back. Was it not enough that she should be. tormented as she had been, without the- taunts and insults of Mr. Colson, Mrs. Halliday, and Aaron Hass? She held out her hands imploringly- and strove to speak; but her tongue re- fused to utter the words, and she fell forward in a fainting fit, brought on by fatigue, excitement and want of nour- ishment. When she came to her senses she was lying on a mattrass in a small, low-ceil- inged attic. Watching over her was a girl of about: her own age-a beautiful, fair Jewess. She was beautiful in the extreme, but; her clothes hung in rags about her, and her face bore the signs of pain and suffering. "Who are you?  Where am I i" cried. Rose, starting up. "I am Miriam Hass. You are in my father's, Aaron Hass, house," said the girl, in sad, melancholy tones. Rose shuddered, for the impression she had of the old Jew was far from favorable.  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6980-00000024"/> "Why am I brought here?" asked Rose. "Heaven knows! If it be that for which I dread, it had been better for you that you had died than lived for Bsuch a life." "Speak! Tell me what you mean?" "I cannot. They would force a hate- ful life upon me, and I resisted. See," said the Jewess, baring her shoulders. Rose shuddered, for upon the girl's fiesh were long, red cuts in every direc- tion, evidently produced by a heavy whip., "Some hag who possesses an influ- ence over my father does this every day;" said Miriam. "Tied to the wall, I am kept powerless, while she flogs me with all her strength." "Oh, it is horrible-too horriblel" eaid Rose, shutting her eyes. The Jewess only sighed, What new perils was Rose about to encounter? She hardly dared think of what might be her fate in the hands of her new jailer. r'or a few moments the two girls re- mained perfectly silent, each consider- ing the other's face with deep atten- tion. Rose was the first to speak. "I do not know as yet that I am really a prisoner." "You do not know!" repeated the Jewess, interrogatively. "No. Is the door locked?" "The door was locked, but the key was outside. I stole up stairs while father was away, to have a look at you." "As it is open now, and he away, why should I not escape?" "Escape?" "Yes. I have lately suffered somuch, passed through so many dangers and perils, that I have become quite brave." "But--but where would you fly t" ' Where?" "Yes.   Where would you be safe from  him t" "My dear girl, I do not understand you. Of course, I should be safe any- where if I got out of the house." "Anywhere?" "Yes. I should only have to appeal to the police." "Would they protect you!" "' Of course. The law allows no ofne to be oppressed." "Does it not?" "i o, nor you among the rest."   !"Oh, if I could believe you!" oried the Jewess, clasping her hands, the ' tears as she spoke welling up into her beautiful blue eyes. "You can believe me, for I speak the truth." "And would you, is it possible that you would kindly aid me also "' "To escape?" "Yes." "Willingly." "When?" "Why not at once, as your father is out?" "Why not at once 7" repeated the Jew- ess, musing. "Suppose we trv? But stay, the old woman is down stairs. I must be sure that she is asleep. She generally takes a nap this time." "Go and see, but do not be long. I shall be dying with impatience until you return." Noiselessly the Jewess opened the door and closed it again Rose listened. A moment afterwards she heard a sup- pressed scream. Then the sound of a souffle. Then low sobbing and more scuffling. Then the banging of a door on the same landing. Trembling with fear and holding her breath, Rose still listened. CHAPTER XII. For a few moments there was a death. like silence, unbroken by the faintest move- ment. Rose, in indescribable alarm, remained in the sitting posture in which the Jewess left her. Owe thing it was easy enough to suppose must have taken plaee. She had been discovered coming out of the room. The question was: Had the conversation that had taken place between them been overheard 7 If it had, any hope of escape was for the time gone. But the silence still continued. What did it mean? As minute after minute passed away, and still no sound reached her ears, Rose grew more and more terrified. The unknown cruelty, if any were being perpetrated upon the young Jew- ess, seemed by its perpetration in this deathlike silence to become ten times more horrible. Much more terrible was this dreadful uncertainty than   it would have been had the victim's cries been heard.   Had her shrieks of agony rent the air. Had the heavy thuds of the cruel whip been audible as they fell upon the palpitating flesh. But the time passed slowly, and yet no sound reached the anxious listen- er. At length she could bear this state of suspense no longer. "Gracious Heaven!" she exclaimed, "what horrors are being perpetrated?" She felt that, though curiosity should cost her her life, she must know what had happened. Yes, she would learn the truth, how- ever great might be the danger she would find in her path. With this intention she prepared to rise. But she was faint and weak. With the greatest difficulty she man- aged to gain her feet. But her frame reeled and she stag- gered forward. Had she not clung to the wall for support she must have fallen headlong to the ground. To some extent, however, conquer- ing her weakness, and guiding herself by the wall, she slowly and laboriously moved to the door. She tried the handle. It turned. The door yielded to a gentle pressure. Without was pitchy darkness. Rose still guided herself by the wall and slowly progressed. All was silent. She had made no discovery. Presently her hand rested on the handle of a door. She opened it. All was dark within. Dark 'as a pool. Closing the door, she continued her journey. She felt round the wall. She reached another, running at right angles. That was the end of the passage. She came to another wall again. She was how on the opposite side of the 1 passage. She still journeyed wearily along, but found no other doors.       1  While thus engaged, the moon, which hitherto had been obscured, shone , brightly forth, and its rays penetrated between the bare of a small grating, 1 serving as a window, and fixed high l up against the ceiling. Its light revealed to her the tdpo- d graphy of the place.   e  There were only two doors, 1  One led into the attic wherein she had ebeen a prisoner, the other was the one that she had just now opened. t  It was this she must have heard - slammed to. There could be no doubt of that. But f what was the mystery connected with the darkness within T Urged on by a devouring curiosity ' respecting the fate of the beautiful young Jewess, she summoned up all ther strength, crossed the passage with- out support, and approached the door in question. 3 Again she opened it. Again she found all pitchy dark , within. But the moon assisting her at the moment, she found that there. was -another partition between her and the joom-a green baize door. Advancing, the outer portal closed upon her, and she was, for an instant, as it were, imprisoned as though -in a sepulchre. But feeling cautiously over the sur- face before her, she presently found a handle and turned it gently. Scarcely had she opened- the door the tenth part of an inch when a piercing shriek met her ear coming from  the room within! It was a shriek of, mingled pain and terror. A shriek, wrung by fiendish' cruelty from some suffering victim. : "h01 mercy! mercy!" she heard. the young Jewess exclaim. "Forheaveon's sake spare me!" "Spare you, indeed!" . cried a voice in reply. "I'd cut you all to bits, if I had my way." "Oh mercy mercy !" "I'd cut your lying tongue out too, that you couldn't tell what I'd done."' "Oh, no, dear Mrs. Starke, you would not be so crpel." "Don't dear me, you deceitful minx. There's no love lost between us, you know that well enough." "But what have I done to you?" "What have you done?  WellI like that!" "I am sure I never meant to harm you." "Didn't you? Well, you harm me by living at all-by ever having been born." "Oh dear, oh dear, I wish I was dead!" "Do you? You should have your  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6980-00000025"/> -wish, too, if it depended on me, young lady." "But you would not kill me?" "There's nothing half bad enough for you in my opinion, I don't want to commit murder.  No, you're safe enough as far as I'm concerned in that respect." "But you are killing me by these cruel floggings!"' "Oh, no, I'm not. At least it's- a very slow job. Why don't you die nat- urally T That's what I want to know. Why don't you die of cold and want! Why don't you catch something? You shall catch a good whipping this time at any rate." "Oh, no, no! Do not beat me this once!" "Yes I shall. You brought it 'on yourself." "But I meant no harm." 4 You knew you were not to go into the nexteroom." "You did not tell me." "You knew you were not to go, with- out being told." "Oh, no, indeed!" "Don't tell me a lie. Take that." Then followed the sound of a blow. Then there was a scream and a groan. Then another blow. Another scream. More blows followed with greater ra- pidity. More screams, still shriller and more piercing. Unable to bear the suspense any long- er, Rose pushed open the door and looked into the room. A horrible sight met her eyes. She sickened with terror. Naked to her waist, the lovely young Jewess was fastened up against the wall. A hideous old hag was flogging her with savage ferocity. The unhappy victim's body was cov- ered with the bruises of bygone atroci- ties. The blood trickled from fresh wounds. Twisting and shrinking, she endeav- ored to escape from the horrible, cruel blows. She struggled in vain. Again and again the blows descended. The poor girl panted for breath. The color forsook her cheeks. Her eyes glazed. Her bosom rose and fell convulsively. Then she was still as death. The nerves in her body seemed sud- denly to relax.   Her limbs gave way beneath her. She hung like a corpse, still and mo- tionless. Only then did the fiend abstain from her cruelty. She stood still at last and allowed her hand to fall by her side. "Have you had enough?" she asked, fiercely. But the young Jewess made no ,reply. "Have you had enough " screamed the hag. Still no answer. "Will you disobey me again? Do you hear? You had better speak." But it was in vain that she thus ques- tioned her victim. Her power of speech was gone. Was she dead? This was thequestion the old woman now asked herself in trembling terror. i The ominous silence alarmed her. She had gone too far, this time. What was to be done? She approached the young Jewess and regarded her with nervous trepida- tion. In a flutter of fright she then loosened her hands and let her gently down. She laid her upon the floor and stood for a moment silently regarding her. The poor girl, however, moved not a muscle. "What is the matter with her, I won- der," the old woman muttered. "( H I hope I haven't gone too far," She stooped down as she spoke by the side of her victim and laid her hand upon the poor girl's heart. In this attitude she remained for several moments, a grey shadow creeping over her evil face. "i-I ve done it," she said at last, with a gasp. Then rose to her feet with a spring. ;'I've killed her."       e The words were uttered in a hoarse whis- per which rang through the room. Poor Rose's blood froze in her veins with terror. She could not, however, have torn her- self away from the spot had her life depend- ed upon it. Something stronger than her will seemed to hold her there. She was fascinated with horror. Spell-bound, transfixed. With greedy eyes Rose watched the move- ments of the old hag. She was gazing eagerly around, as if in search of something. She took a candle in her hand and made a totur of the room.   She closely inspected the floor, missing scarcely an Inch in her scrutiny. All at once she paused and uttered a low exclamation. Then withher nands began scratching at the floor. Rose watched eagerly. The hag soon got her fingers between the boards. She raised a plank slowly, laid it on one side and lifted out another. Rose now saw an aperture about a foot and a half wide and six feet long. It looked like awgrave. Raising the inanimate form of the beauti- ful youug Jewess in her arms, she carried it to the place. Then lowered it into the chasm. Rose's heart beat violently. She had killed her 'then. The body of the girl thus disposed of, the hag replaced the planks. Fetching a broken piece of iron from the fireplace, she, with its aid, knocked in the nails again. The old wretch paused for a moment, and raised the candle above her head, shaded her eyes, and scanned the floor around. There were the stains of blood upon one of the boards, and these she shuffled out with her feet. Then she cautiously hid the instru- ment of torture up the chimney, and glanced around again. There was now nothng ingthe appear- ance of the room to lead a casual obser. ver to suppose that so dreadful a deed had been committed in it. The qvidences of her crime had dis. appeared. For a time, at least, she was safe. But for how long? As she stood now the candle-light  fell full upon her evil face, and Rose thought she never yet had seen so forbid- ding a countenance. Her eyes were bloodshot, and peered out, from beneath bushy grey eyebrows, rough and ragged. Her mouth was like asplit in herface, from which protruded two great teeth, -more like those of some wild Vnimoal than a human being. Her frame was tall and muscular, and Rose could easily understand that the unhappy Miriam   had struggled vainly to resist her murderous attacks. "And I, too," Rose could not help thinking, " shall I also fall a victim to.  her brutality " As the dreadful idea passed throughh ,   g our heroine's mind, the old hag gave one last glance ronnd the room, and ap- r preached the door. For the first time did- Rose begin to t reflect upon the danger she was rup- ning. How many women since the world began have paid a heavy penalty for their curiosity? a  Had her turn come now? As the. old woman approached the ; door, Rose felt behind her for the door handle.               ' She allowed the green baize door to close in front of her, and was now in total darkness. There was not a moment to lose, and yet, for the life of her, she could not find any fastening upon the inside of the door, which shut her out from the passage. In scrambling terror she searched for it. But her search was fruitless. Great Heaven, what would become of her? The old hag's steps approached. In another moment poor Rose would be discovered. Wildly she pressed her hands over the surface of the door. She flung herself- gainst it with all her strength, but it yielded not an inch. Again-and again. And now the horror of the situation reached its climax. The door in front of her opened slowly. She was face to face with the, mur- deress. Face to face with the fiendish old hag, who glared at her from beneath her beetling brow. Face to face, thovgh but for one brief moment. Then the old woman, uttering a dis- mal howl, flung up her long arms, and fell back senseless upon the floor. Using all the strength which yet re- mained to her," Rose dashed herself against the closed portal. It gave way with a crash. She flew on with lightning .speed. She reached the staircase and bound- ed down the stairs. But suddenly a heavy hand was laid uponher shoulder. She shrieked and struggled to free herself. But her unseen asailant still'held her fast.  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6980-00000026"/> Then a deadly faintness crept over her, and the unhappy girl swooned with weakness and terror. CHAPTER XIII. UPON this dreadful scene there came a long interval of unconsciousness. A long, death-like sleep, as it seemed to Rose, of the duration of which she could form no idea. Life was for a time a blank to her. She awoke at length to find herself lying in bed, in a gloomy but not un- comfortable room, and came to the con- clusion, when at length she recovered to some extent her scattered thoughts that she had been very ill. At first when she opened her eyes the recollection of the scene of terror through which she had passed when last she was conscious returned to her, and she glanced around in terror, expecting to fd herself in the power of the old With the idea of escape still predom- inating over all other thoughts, she en- deavored to rise. But she found that this was impos- sible. With a deep sigh she sank back on her bed and closed her eyes again. When she again opened them she found an old woman standing by the bedside. She started back with a; shudder, for she fancied at first that it was the old hag. But a second glance convinced her that she was mistaken. And yet there certainly was a strong likeness. How could it be accounted for? Rose asked herself the question in wondering astonishment. There were certainly the features, or features strongly resembling them, but the expression was not the same. No, the expression of this woman was even mild and gentle. 4' Well, my dear," she said in a low soft tone. That was certainly not the old 'hag's voice. "How are you now?" "Thank you," repliod Rose, "I am auch better. But pray tell me, where Un I " "Do not be alarmed on that score, ay dear." "No-but--"   "But you are very anxious to know?' "Indeed I a;l. I cannot rest until 1 learuI thto truth." "Well then, bless your pretty face, so you shall." "Thank you." "All in good time." Rose looked rather disappointed. Yes, :lear, ill in good time. In the meantime I will tell you one thing." "What is that!" "That you are amongst friends." With this assurance Rose was, for the present, obliged to remain satisfied. But it was impossible to rest so long i as iUe remained in doubt. j Therefore, when she saw the oppor- tunity, she again endeavored to draw her companion into conversation. "Would you kindly answer me one 'question?" she asked. "That all depends, my love, on what the question is." "When I fainted away I was in au old Jew's house." "Hush, my dear, so you are now." { Rose's heart sank within her. And yet when she thought the mat- ter over she could not believe it possi- ble that this could be the den of assas- sins into which she had tallen when endeavoring to dispose of her locket. "But-but," she stammered, " where is Miriam?" "Miriam," replied the woman, "is upstairs, butt you shall see her pre- sently."t Rose shut her eyes with a shudder. Meanwhile the old woman bulied herself about the room,. noiselessly ar- ranging thl furniture. As Rose looked at her stealthily from time to time mhe could not help think- ing that she mlust have been mistaken in her identity. How was it to be ac- counted for? to 'r *-  . Tile face of the old hag whom sho hal seeii so brutally ill-treating the lovely young Jewess. was certainly I distorted by passion, but not so as to be thus unrecognisable. I Really it seemed impossible to sup- pose that she could be so changed, and ; yet there could be no doubt about the fact that she did slightly resemble her. - Could she be her sister I But this was not the only question which puzzled our heroine. What did the woman mean when ahe spoke of Miriam I Was not the young Jewess dead T   Had not Rose with her own eyes seen her foully and cruelly butchered? She should  see her presently, the woman said. Where? In her grave. But that would seem as though her hosts intended to murder her, and that wIas n ot possible. No, if that had been their intention they would not be nursing her in this way. No, they would havelether die,unless they wished to reserve her for-some worse fate. Rose presently summoned up her i courage to inquire after the old woman. Her companion seemed not to under- I stand her. "What old woman t" she asked.  ' "H thought-," stammered Rose. t She was going to say what she knew of her, but stopped herself very sud- 1 denly.  "You thought what, my dear?"  n "I thought-that is, I fancied-" "Yes. You fancied--"       , "At least, I mean Miriam told me-, cl "What? b? "-Thatthere was an old woman, who w -who-"  "Who what?" Who lived in her father's house." wi Rose's companion had been staringat ot her fixedly, whilst she was thus stam. ve mering out a verylame explanation. th When she concluded the old woman's be eyes dropped, and Rose could not help fancying that a sinister smile for one di moment crossed her face like a shadow wa and was instantly gone.  The conversation ceased here for a mS time, and our heroine was left to her abc thoughts, which were anything  but it. satisfactory.  Indeed, the more she  pondered on ges what little the old woman had told her, to  the less she liked the look of things. '  It was altogether very extraordinary felt and mysterious; but more mysteries  S were yet to come.         a sg Later in  the day the master of the her house made his appearance.      A Rose  started up in bed at sight of arm him, and her heart throbbed violently. hers There was no mistake in his case. whi( It was the old Jew, Aaron Hass, who the: had accused her of theft.

"That's right, my dear," said the Jew- "You must get well as soon as her ever you can, and we, will see ifwe ;hat can't make your fortune." yMake her fortune! ion nRose pondered  on his strange words this uneasily. Bnt a greater surprise than ever yet ess awaited her. lme  The door opened, and Miriam entered. She was neatly-indeed, prettily her dressed. She  was radiant with smiles, and looked the picture of happiness. She came straight towards the bed- side, and, seating herself upon a chair, took Rose's hand in hers. The eyes of the two girls met in  a long, earnest gaze, but Rose, in silent astonishment, saw that Miriam showed not the faintest sign of recognition. Could it be possible that this was the same  Miriam whom she had seen sA " cruelly ill-fteated-whom she had seen buried beneath the, boards of the attio o where the brutal outrage was perpe- trated? As well as she was able to do so, without attracting the notice of the t other two  people in the room, Rose  ventured upon some dim allusions to the dreadful scene of which she had 3 been a  witness. But Miriam did not respond-indeed 2 did not appear to understand what aXh r was talking about. Wearied and worn out by all tliis mystery, poor Rose, with a  deep sigh, abandoned any further efforts to solve She, therefore, at the woman's sug- gestion, closed her eyes again and went to sleep. Next day she was much better, and felt much stronger when she awoke. She expressed a desire to get up for a   short time, and the woman assisted  her to rise. After this she sat in a comfortable armchair by. the fireside, and amused herself by reading some novels, of which there where several lying about the room. The next day passed in much the same fashion, enlivened by conversa- tions with Aaron Hass, the woman (whose name was, as she found out,'  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6980-00000027"/> Mrs. Woodruffe), and Miriam, though a of the latter she saw but very little. f The next day and the next passed away.  Rose was quite well now, and grow- f ing more curious than ever.    1 Why was she kept there, and thus 1 hospitably treated? For the life of her, although she puz- i zled her pretty head a great deal upon the subject, she couldfind no reasonable solution of the enigma.      ] Still there was a reason. Alas! too soon would she learn the dreadful truth! Too soon, and yet too late. After Rose had been convalescent about a week, she was invited down- stairs to a little sitting-room by Mr. ,lass, who wanted to speak to her. She found him seated at a table, ablolt which were littered a quantity of papers. He was writing as she entered the apartment, and called to her without looking up. "Well, my dear, and how are you to-day "             I "I am quite well, sir, thank you," answered Rose. 1"Quite well, eh? That's right. We must not waste all our youth and roses in a sick room; eh, my dear?" ' No, sir, I hope not." "Oh, you hope not? You are not without ambition, eh?" "I should very much like to get on, air, in the profession I have chosen." "The theatrical profession, eh I The ballet you tried, I think." "Yes, sir. I did not wish to be in the ballet at first, but I could not ob- tain- , "Another opening, eh I You did well to choose that. You chose what you could excel in." "4 Oh, sir," said Rose, blushing, "I am not sure of that. But if I only had a chance--" "From what little you did, though, I could see very well that you had enor- mous talent, Miss Rose." "Did you see me, sir?" "Of course, I did. You were the- the-what is it?" Rose named the character she had personified. "Oh, to be sure--to be sure. I for- got at the moment. Very clever it was too." "I am delighted to hear you say so,   sir. I was a little nervous, as it was my first appearance." "Your first appearance! Impossible! Bless me! I shouldn't have believed it from any other lips. Ah! you must not be hidden under a bushel any longer, that's certain." "Do you think then, sir, that there is any chance ." !"I'm sure there is. That's what I've got to say to you. There is a wonder- ful chance--such a one as does not fall out once in a hundred years."' "Oh! sir." "What do you say, then?" "To what, sir?" "' To take an engagement." "I should be only too delighted, sir, of course." "Of course, and so you shall. I ex- pect one of the managers here to-day." "To-day?" "Yes; in an hour or so. You shall be introduced to him." "Oh, how can I thank you, sir?" "Don't do it at all, my dear. There's no occasion." I "How can I ever repay you?" "I shall take care you never do, Rose, my dear. Good-bye for the pres- ent. I will call you when I want you." Rose would have liked very much to make some inquiries, but Mr. Hass did not give her the opportunity. "I have got some letters to write. Good bye-good bye. Come down when I send for you."  She of course felt extremely curious respecting the promised engagement. i How could it be otherwise? She wanted very much to know what theatre it could be at, and which of the I managers it was who was coming to call a upon her generous host: All these particulars, however, she a was compelled to wait patiently for. a  In about an hour after she had spoken to Aaron Hass the bell rang, and Mrs. I Woodruffe told her to go downstairs - again. She found a stranger in the room with the Jew. Yes, he was a stranger to Rose, although she fancied that she knew d most of the city managers by sight, as from her childhood she had been a r- regular attendant at the theatres, and s had often seen them, summoned before the curtain, besides'having seen several D, during the last few weeks, whilst mak- *,'^   ing her daily applications for an inter- view at the various stage doors. This particular manager, however, was certainly unknown to her, and, moreover, 'was not-at all the sort of person Rose would have fancied likely to occupy such a position. He was very young. He could not have been much more than pineteen or twenty, at the utmost. There was n bSighs of whiskers on his cheeks. He rejoiced in two or three straggling hairs on his upper lip, but that was all. He was extremely pale. His hair was straw-colored. He had no eyelashes at all, and no eye-brows to speak of. His eyelids were red and swollen, and his eyes weak. His cheeks were hollow, and he spoke in a faint voice, at times scarcely audible. He swore fearfully. He was showily dressed, and his clothes were reeking of stale tobacco. He carried a riding whip, and wore spurs. "Ah, my dear," said the Jew, look- ing up, " here he is. Here's my mana- ger."  Rose bowed, and the manager nod- ded.  "There's the young lady, Tom, that I was talking to you albout." "Proud of the honor," said Tom. "She'll make your fortune, sir, and! herown too; mark my words if she don't." "I hope so, sir. Ballet, you said, didn't you ." "Yet, to be sure. The ballet. You've got a vacancy you say?" "Oh, yess certainly." "Miss 6eymour will fill it then, sir, with credit." "I have no doubt she will, sir, if you say SO." "Of course. I have got two forms of engagement written out, and only want your two signatures." "If I could have seen what the young lady could do," remarked Tom. "Do!" interrupted Aaron Hass. '.Do anything tilat Carlotta Grisi ever did, only a great deal better. You don't want more than that, do you?" "Well, no, that will do, I think." "Here are the forms, then. There need be no more time lost, need there?" "No', certainly not. I accept the young lady on your recommendation, Mr. Hasa."   "That's satisfactory, eh, Miss Rosel" "Yes, sir,'- stammered Rose, bewil- dered and confused. "If you-if H yes, sir; I think so." e "To be sure. To be sure. Now then, my dear, just write your name to this." As he spoke, the Jew handed her a pen and spread a large, formidable parchment before her, closely filled with crabbed characters. Aaron placed his finger on aparticular spot, and said: "Sign.'here." She did as she- was told, though with some vague suspicion that the -proceed- ings were, somewhat irregular. She wrote hert name, taking, as she did so, a hurried 'glance at the lengthy document.     .       ' She could read scarcely half a dozen wo'rds, however, because the handwri- !ting was suchsa curious one, it seemed She made out a few words, though, which were filled in, in another style of caligraphy. The words were: "Twenty-five dollars a week." Tenty-five dollars a week! 'What did that mean?  Could it be possible that such a salary was going to be hers?      .. A dreadful suspicion passed through i her tind a moment afterwatds. i Was her taleit worth that amount t What would she be expected to dot Could she do it? There was no time'to go into any ex- planation, however. Neither was there any opportunity.  : She was on the point of speaking, but, somehow, could not manage to get in a word edgeways. Wlien she had signed her name Aaron rang a bell standing on the table by his side. A young man, having the appearance of a lawyer's clerk, entered the room in answer to the summons. "Jackson," said Mr. Hass. "I want you to witness this signature." The clerk signed his name on the doc- ument. "'Now, my dear, I need not detain you any longer. We will .have a chat at teatime." He opened a door for Rose as he spoke, and she passed out without a word. She was indeed dumbfounded by what had happened.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6980-00000028"/> Surely there never was such a house of mystery as this. Mysteries, in- deed-it was chock full of them! When she reached her own room another surprise was awaiting her. The old woman was there, and rose as ashe entered. "Well, my dear," said Mrs. Wood- rffe, "'how do you get ont Is it all settled T" She had not mentioned the subject before, and Rose was surprised. "Yes," she replied slowly, " it is." "That's capital. I hope it's as good an engagement as that of Miriam." "Miriam! Is she engaged also?" "Yes, she has just gone." "Gone t" echoed Rose. "Gone this afternoon. She wanted tosay good-bye, but could not wait." "What a hurried affair it seems to have been!" "Yes; there was not a moment to spare. These opportunities occur so seldom, one must not allow them to slip through one's fingers." "And so she has gone. You did not say where the theatre was." a Some distance from here, my dear: it's in the Bowery." Rose ponderedover what she had just heard. It was all very strange and in- explicable. What was to be the end? She hadno opportunity of having the promised chat with Mr. Hass, respect- ing her own engagement, and that day and the next passed away without her being able to see him. Therefore, much to her astonishment, about six o'clock the third day. Mrs. 1 Woodruffe said:          i "My dear, I ought to have told you. 1 Pray get ready as quick as you can; we I have to go down to the theatre."  ] "For a rehearsal?" asked Rose. "I don't know what it is, my dear," ] said the old woman, " but we haven't a  momentto spare." "What theatre is it?"  "Well, I don't know that either, but we're to meet Mr. Hass at the Bank." 7 All this was as mysterious as ever. At the Bank!  There were surely no E theatres in the Bowery where a ballet- girl's salary was twenty-five dollars a week.  Five dollars was much nearer E the amount. As the old woman gave her no infor- mation, however, she could do no other than curb her impatience, and wait till time should reveal all.      g   They started together in a coach at about seven o'clock. and drove west- ward. Rose, although she had been born ip New York, knew very little about its geography, and could form no idea of where they were going. They stopped at length in a dark, quiet back street, of a very -mean and poverty- stricken aspect, before what seemed to be a stage door. As she alighted she saw that such was the case, and turning to her companion, she ex- claimed distrustfully : "I thought you did not know what thea- ' tre it was at." But the old woman made no reply, and the manager, to whom she had been intro- duced before, appearing at the moment, she accompanied him into the home, in obedi- ence to his desire. He led her up a long passage, and out upon a large stage, very naked and dingy; then into a small dressing-room, where there was a woman waiting. "Be quick and dress," said he. "I want you to go on at once." "Go on!" she repeated. Why I thought this was a rehearsal." But at that moment a loud roar of voices and a great thumping of feet convinced her that a large audience was assembled, and that she was expected to go before them. To do what? CHAPTER    XIV. FOR whatever reason she had been brought to the theatre, it was very evident to Rose that its proprietor thought there was no time to lose, for several times during the progress of her toilet, he came knocking at the door, anxiously inquiring if she was nearly ready. She found a ballet-dress ready for her. It was very gaudy, and   by no means too clean. "Am I to wear this?" she asked, with an expression of distaste. "That's your dress," replied the woman. "But it is an   old one belonging to some one else." "Yes." "Well, then, it is not intended for me, surely." "Yes it is." , ' Whose was it, pray?" "The last one's." "The last one's!" replied  Rose in surprise.   But before she could inquire further the manager came hammering again the third or fourth time at the door. "Are you nearly ready?" "Very nearly, sir." "Be quick, then, for Heaven's sake, or they'll have the place down." He went away again in a rampant state, and Rose ventured once' more to question her companion. "What Iam I to do?" she asked. "Do! What do you mean?" 'Am I to appear before the public to- night?" "Of course you are. What else do you suppose you're wanted for? You can dance, can't you?" "Yes, I can dance a little." "You'll have to do your best, or else you'll soon be goosed I can tell you." "Goosed?" "That's hissed. Why, what sort of a' theatre did you come from  that you don't know the commonest terms?" Poor Rose was silent.  A dreadful misgiving had for some time past taken possession of her mind. Oh, how she wished herself at home again.                I Home! Alas!. she had nowhere which 1 she could call by that name. Utterly homeless and friendless, what v fate was reserved for her in the end?  Urged to exert herself to the utmost by the repeated suimons from without, a ,and the flurried orders and suggestions X of the woman assisting her, Rose was t soon attired. "Thank goodness, jou're ready at t1 last!" said the manager, meeting her a outside the door. "Yes, I  am ready," replied Rose, still panting from her exertions, "but H A] "Come along, for goodness sake!" a "Am I to go on in-" '"Yes, of course. You've kept the h stage waiting ten minutes as it is;" "But-but what am I   to do?" to "Go on and dance-anything  you aI like. Something in the pas-scul way, of course."               t "Bqlt without any rehearsal?"  ha "There's been Bo time for that. te Look there!" "Where?"             W ' At that picture.'        th4 "The poster"           ed ' Yes, the gal dancing-Signora Zan. frita. Yes, sir.  ' Yes, sir."    er 4 "Well, that's to be you.' ;he  "Me?" "She was billed for to-night, but she can't come, and so we're obliged to shove yoou on instead."- eB, t But won't they know, sir?" "Who?" nt  "The audience." to  "No, they'll be none the wiser. She was just about your height, and you're something like her." "But perhaps she may have circula- o- ted a report that she is not performing here." lo "nOh, no, she hasn't, and she can't Hu now." "Why?" "Because she's dead." e  Rose shuddered, and pressed her hand to her heart. She, then, was wearing the dead a woman's clothes! u  She was about to take her place. By this time they were standing at 1l the wing by the prompter's side. n-- oLwthen, young lady," said the manager, "keep your spunk up, you 3 know. Go in and win. Keep at it. whatever you can do. Never mind how i  baditis. Do something." Rose looked at him in a bewildered t way, scarcely comprehending what he was saying to her. At the same    time casting her eyes around, she now obtained her first fair view of the stage upon which she was to appear. Anything more dirty and dingy than the appearance of all things around and about her it was difficult to conceive. The scenes were torn and ragged. The dresses of one or two actors whom she saw hanging about in a disconsolate way  were woefully poverty-stricken and dilapidated. What theatre could this be? she asked herself. How could this be a house affording , to give twenty-five dollars a week sal- ary? There seemed to be no company, no other actress, no green-room that she had yet seen. It was all a  deep mys- tery. There was one thing, though, which was not wanting, but which sometimes the first theatres in the world have lack- ed-an audience. There was a   large concourse oi peo- ple assembled. So it seemed to Rose, ,y tlbe dealfening thunder of their  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6980-00000029"/> fett, by their angry shouts, shrill lcr leches, and piercing cat-calls. It did not sound very much like an aristocratic audience which she had to tilce, and her heart beat faster as she listened. "Drink some of this," saidl the mana- ger in her ear, and offering her a glass of wine as he spoke. She drank it willingly, for she felt weak aund faint. In a moment the curtain rose, and a loud crash of music half deafened her. "Now then! now then!" cried the prompter. There was a momentary silence, and she bounded on to the stage. The audience  taking her for the Signora Zanirlta, uted her with a tremenduous round of applause, which was twice repeated. Although her experience of the terpsi- chorean art was, as we know, but limit- ed, so great was Rose Seymour's beauty, so matchless the symmetry of her splendid form, that it was but natural it latat her first appearance the audience would be prejudiced in her favor. Knowing, from  what the manager had said, that a great deal was expected of  ' she exerted herself to the ut- most. One moment she was floating sylph- like, scarcely touching the ground, the next bounding, whirling, twirling, per- forming almost incredible gyrations, until, panting for breath, at last, she paused, whilst the audience roared forth their approbation. But with the applause they showered upon her came other and more substan- tial tokens of their regard, the novelty of which astonished and terrified her. A handful of pennies were dashed on to the stage, one of which striking her sharply on the shoulder caused her to start with a half-suppressed scream to her feet. The next moment she turned to fly from the stage. Bult her motive being understood, a terrific shout of "Hi! hi!" came from all parts of the house. Then more pennies came rattling on- to the boards. Turning for an instant to face her patrons, she for the first time was able form something like a correct con- jecture respecting their number and character. It was certainly a good-sized theatre and densely crowded.   For the most part of it was com posed of boys and gills, ragged and dirty, upon the faces of whom were ckearly traced the brands of infamy. Hooting and howling, fighting and brawling, these depraved young wretches were only with the greatest difficulty kept in anything like subjec- tion by certain sturdy ruffians attached to the establishment, whlo, when oc- casion called for such a course, laid about them with a thick stick. This evening the audience was more unruly than usual. They had been kept waiting so long that they had lost all patience. Now, therefore, that they had mada up their miunds that Rose should per form again they would brook no delay. But they were doomed to disappoint- ment. The poor girl, scared out of her wits by their discordant cries, fled precipi- tately from the stage. She bent her steps towards the room where sh&amp;e had attired herself in the ballet costume, intending to resame her own clothes. Upon the wy th ither, howeve?, sh3; L met the manager in a state of fury, "What are you doing?"'! he ask-ld, with an oath. "Why don't you go .,  again?" "Oh, sir," cried Rose, with tears in her eyes, " how can you ask me?" "Ask you! What do you mean! 5 Don't you hear them calling for you?" ' Yes, sir. But; I'm afraid." Y "You must go," said the man, grasp- l ing her roughly by the arm. No- no! Please--" (' Still you must." But, sir!" I  "Don't you know that you have r signed an agreement?---.that 1 can pun- ) ish you if you do not do my bidding?" v  "But, sir, they fiighten me! They will lmrrt me! lHark, how they are screaming' and stamping now!" "You poor, pate-faced little fool," L growled the mlt u between his clenched i teeth. "I ha1 lve said thatyou should go on0 again, and by hleaven you shall!" There was something in his fatce which she wed that he was determined : she should do whiat hIe said. If llecessary, he would use violence. But as Rose saw this, so at the same I time she determined that she would not yield to his unreasonable demand. Wrvenclhing from  his grip, she ran towards the dressing-room.   tie sprang after her, and caught her 1 In his arms.            I She uttered a piercing shriek, and s struggled desperately to free herself.  He was by no means a strong man, and, her fierce rage lending  her strength, she at last broke from him. Then, with one bound, she cleared what distance still remained between her and the dressing-room door. She slammed it to in the face of her pursuer. He stayed for la moment, striving vainly to force the lock, and then, with a savage curse, returned to the stage. The uproar by this time had reached its height. Upon his making his appearance be- hind the foot lights he was saluted with a torrent of abuse. "Ladies and gentlemen," said he, ap- pealing to the rabble before him, " it's not my fault. I've paid her her salary, and she won't dance. I can't make her. If you can I wish you would." Scarcely were the words out of his mouth when half a dozen young ruffians sprang upon the stage. CHAPTER XV. WITH a savage whoop, which would have done credit to the lungs of Indians, they rushed across the stage, flinging the manager upon his back as they dash- ed past him. "Stop! Stop!" he roared. "Police! Police!" But it was too late now to remedy the mischief. He ought to have thought what damage this rag-tag and bob-tail would do to his theatre before he spoke so im- prudently. Now  he might just as well have tried to stem a raging torrent with his hat. They poured past hinm howling and shrieking. They drove the terrified carpenter be- tore them like chaff before a hurricane. There were two or three ballet-girls whom Rose had not seen, their dressing room being on the other side of the stage. Into their private apartment the mob burst, howling for our heroine, and sending the girls flying in every direc- tion with shrieks of terror. One of these damsels, to get rid of her   persecutors, informed them where our heroine was to be found, and they in- stantly turned and rushed in the indi- cated direction. Rose seemed to comprehend instinct- tively their design. The sound of their hurrying feet coming in her direction, mingled with the shrieks of women and oaths of men, first' apprised her of the approaching danger. The warning was but very short. Almost at the next moment there arose a fiendish yell without the door. Then came splitting blows upon the panel. "What are we to do?" -asked Rose, in terror, of her companion. "How am I to say?" retorted the other fiercely. "If they kill you, you will only have yourself to thank." "What do you sawI?" "I say what I mlan. Your own stupid squeamishness has brought all this upon you." "What do they want?," "They wanted you to danco again, and you would'nt. "You 'll be roughly handled, my fine lady, mark my words if you ain't." "Tell me, without wasting any more time in talk. How can we escape ." "No way that I know of." "Yes, there must be a way." "Well, find it." 'Where does that other door lead to?" "You'd better go and see. I shan't help you." The panels of the outer door by this time were splintered beneath the blows of those without. Had not the door ben protected in- side by a wooden bar placed across it, it would long since have been broken open. But the roughs were not thus to be kept at bay by a trifle. A party of five or six, finding that their separated efforts were useless, formed themselves into a sort of batter- ing,-ram. Altogether they hurled themselves suddenly against the door. It creaked and trembled. Another rush. The doorposts began to tear away from the wall. Now came- the last effort. A terrible crash, a dozen strong, and the door was carried, doorposts and all.  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6980-00000030"/> But while these vigorous measures were being adopted by the mob, Rose was by no means idle. The other door, about which she qllestioned the dresser, she found to be loclke. But the lock was not of a very formid- ablo nature. Fear lent her strength. She soon mastered this opposition. Flinging herself against the door, she flung it open with a loud crash. 'Thien rushed out. Before her there was a staircase, lead- ing to the flies. Without hesitating a moment she splralng lightly up the steps. But the mob, breaking in caught sight of her muslin skirt, as she fled beforet thenm.               k With a ferocious yell they followed in pursuit. On  she fled, caring not where she , went, staying not to consider whether I there was a safe footing to be found up t among the dusty scenery and confused :I mblIlage of ropes amidst which she t had taken refuge. On she ran. There was a beam before her, scarcely 1 broad enough to stand upon with both f feet set together.         b She passed across without a moment's h hesitation.            ,i The roughs, afraid to follow, howled after her in fury.         t,] Others, taking a hasty glance around, . sought out a  ladder on the other side of the stage, and scrambled up to cut off her retreat.            h With flashing eyes and heaving breast the young and lovely girl turned pant- ing to face her foes.        ta Sho cast her eyes around in search of p some other outlet.         d There was no way of escaping, how- ever, except by the road she had come ce Iy or the other staircase, now blocked up by her assailants.        4 The only chance for her then was to dodge her pursuers about among the flies, across the beams, in and out amuong the tangled cordage and the stI lumbering machinery.        shi A wild and exciting chase it was for th both hunters and hunted, but a  cruel one to the latter.         th From beam to beam she flew with lightning speed, the agile wretches one springing after her, utterly reckless as stil it now seemed of their lives and limbs. i 1 i   res  Scarcely a step did she take without )se the danger of a frightful fall. e fore than once the rotten woodwork he cruilbled beneath her, but she sprang be lightly on, now and then tottering and staggering, but recovering herself as d- though by magic. The longer, however, the race con- tinued, the more intense became her fear of falling into the hands of the 4e wretches now so intent upon hunting her down. Their brutal jests and horrible threats a- scared her out of her wits. The whole house was now in an up- Le roar, and the audience had scrambled pell-mell on the stage. it The sound of smashing glass was to be -e heard every moment, mingled with the shrieks of the women. n  Loud cries were raised for the police and against the barricaded doors the e constables without were struggling fu. r riously with the mob inside for admit p tance. A1 more horrible saturnalia than the theatre presented it would be scarcely possible to imagine. The rabble, dancing and shrieking like so many incarnate fiends, were now ifor the most part intoxicated, having broken into the refreshment rooms and helped themselves gratuitously to all the liquors there to be found. Poor Rose saw that she would be treated roughly indeed, did she have the misfortune to fall into their hands. But hlow to escape? Ah! there was one chance which she had not hitherto thought of. She was now close to the proscenium. She might descend by one of the cur- tain ropes, then fly across the stage, and perhaps make her way out by the stage door. No sooner was this rash project con- ceived than it was put-into execution. Dropping on her hands and knees she took a  firm hold of the rope below her. Then swung herself forward. It was a moment of fearful peril. Had she loosened her hold (and the strain upon her wrists was enormous) she must have dashed her brains out on the floor below. But she was safe, and glided down the rope. Thus, however, did she- escape from one danger only to encounter another still more terrible. In glidling down the rope her muslin   apments came in contact with the gas jets by the side,  In a moment she was in a blaze. Before she reached the ground the flames surrounded her. "Help! help!" shrieked the terrified ballet-girl, and, with that fatal impulse So which all women in the moment of peril seemed doomed to yield, she rush- ed wildly about the stage. The rapid passage through the air tnned the flames into terrific fury bove her head and entirely envelop- ed her lovely form. She shrieked aloud in an agony of error. She flung herself upon the floor and rolled over and over. She seized her blazing skirts in her hands and tried one moment to crush out the flames, the next to tear her garments from her body. But, alas! in both efforts she was iled by her own confusion and fright. At the moment, though, when her situation seemed to be very precarious cloak was flung around her. She had lost all command over her- self now, and struggled furiously with 1 or would-be saviour. But he held her down with a strength I against which her efforts were of no He choked her, half-smothered her, held her prisoner in spite of her 1 struggles. At length when he removed the cloak was half-fainting. She was too much frightened by what h e  had just passed through to remem- In the pursuit of the ruffians who had o on the cause of all.       is But opening her eyes, she found that e  awas surrounded and hemmed in by e tabbering mob, upon whom her suffer- a [gs and dangers had no effect. She had, however, found a  protector. ol Ill his arms she was safely carried ai rough the crowd.         th Several rushes were made at her on e  way, but his strong right arm kept r   antagonists at a respectful distance. Bearing her as easily as though she lil d   been a child, he carried Rose into street.             as lhen another man came up to himn claiming-             as ' Poor girl! is she much hurt?" ' No," replied he who had so gallant- rescued her, "I hope I  have saved be r ith scarcely a scar."'    110   "as ", It would indeed havebeen a misfor tune for so lovely a creature to be sac rificed."  Here Rose murmured some he words of entreaty, thongh in so low a tone as to be inaudible. "You are quite safe," said the second man, who was about sixty, with long, of silvery locks hanging arounda mild and pleasant face.  "Do not be alarmed." "Where are you going to take me "' ,r she asked faintly. y  "We will take you home, if you wil ?- tell us where that is." Rose looked at him wildly but made f no answer. Home! 1  Unhappy girl, where indeed was she to look for one? r    "My carriage is waiting here," said h the old man. "You had better come r into it, and as we drive along you can collect yourself a little and'decide where s you wish to go."  He spoke so kindly, so gently, that tr it was almost impossible to believe him s to have any sinister motive in making this proposition. But she had already fallen into suchl traps, met with such double-faced hy- pocrites, that it was not to be wondered? - at, if she was somewhat distrustful. But she felt so ill. She was so weak and weary. She had not strength to struggle lon;'r. Her brain was confused. She could not reason. She could not make an effort to save herself from any new danger. Without a murmur she allowed the old gentleman and his younger compan- ion to assist her into the carriage. As they drove along she closed her eyes and for some moments lapsed into a half-unconsciouq state. The two men conversed in a low tone of voice. and she could catch but a faint and confused notion of the subject of their conversation. "It is most extraordinary," one said. "I  could scarcely have believed it." "'Yet there are some instances of a like character." t"In plays and tales you mean--sueh as the Corsican Brothers, for instance." "No, I don't. I mean in real life, such as in the case of the Courier of Lyons." "What was that?" "A respectable man accused of rob- bery and murder, and sworn to by a roon-full of witnesses."  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6980-00000031"/> ' Well t" "Well, after he was executed it turn- ed out that they had got hold of the wrong man." "But they hanged him?" "What, the right man!  I forget what they did to him, but it doesn't much signify. They hanged the wrong one; that's the great point we've got to look to." "To be sure. And he was so like the other man, eh?" "Like! As like as two peas. It was most extraordinary, it would seem. The man wrongfully accused was spoken up for by a score of respectable people, and he proved a very tolerable alibi, but they hanged him all the same." ' Tho other-" "Was a strolling vagabond, escaped prisoner, or something of that sort. When he was taken, the witnesses all swore to him as positively as they had done to the other." "They were a little bit ashamed of themnselves, though, I should fancy?" "Ay, and said that they never would make such a mistake again." "They'll make it in our case, though, I'll wager a dollar. What say you?" I can't see, myself, how they can do otherwise. The likeness is really most extraordinary." "If she had only happened to be a boy, eh?" "Ah! there's always some drawhack to every good scheme." "However, the next best thing to her being- a boy is being a ballet-girl." "To be sure ; anything but an actress I should have felt nervous about." "Oh, a lesson or two will teach her all she will want to know." "If she doesn't make any oljection." There's not much chance of that, I should think." "Goodness knows; there's no doing anything with some women." "We'll manage her, thlough, I tlink. If she has any nonsense-" "Hush!" "Is she listenling, do you think? 1 fancy she's fainted." "Let's drop the subject, anyhow, for the present." They then rode on in silence for a short time. Presently the wheels crushed upon the gravel in a garden-path l. Then the carriage calme to a stand still. They were in front of al resildence,   in what appeared to be a country seat Rose aroused herself. and looked ner vously round. "Where am I!" she murmured. "You are quito safe," the old ma repeated. "We must get out here." "What house is this?" "A hospital, where you will be we cared for." "But I ama not ill. I am only a little frightened and tired." She strove to rouse herself as she spoke, and to stand -without his assist ance. But the effort was in vain. She would have fallen, had not the young man caught her in his arms. Very gently then he carried her  the steps into the house, and laid her down upon a couch in a well-furnished room. The old man then unlocked a side board, from which he took out a dectan ter and a wine glass. Rose drlank the wine he offered l and felt greatly refreshed. The old man tlhen offered her another but this she refused. Presently she began to feel much better, but as she gradually recovered from the effects of her fright she began to be very uneasy. She wanted to go away from the house into which they had brought her but where was she to go to? She was not quite in a fit state to into the street. Without the clo which the young man  had throw around herm her dress, owing to the ravages of the flames, was extreme limited. However, she felt that she could not remain there, and presently, when s was strong enough, rose to her feet. "I must go now,'" she said. "Where to?" asked the old man blandly. "To-to-" But here she paused. Where, indeed "Where do you live?" "I don't live anywhere, but-" "But what?" "I cannot remain here." "Indeed!" "No-I-" "I think you can. In fact, you must "Must 7 " ' Yes, young lady. Sit down and allow me to speak to you seriously." He took hold of her wrist and gently forced her into a seat.   "Now,. young lady," said the old man, " you had better understand me at once." 4' Ye-es." "You will have to represent the character of a young -gentleman. If you act well and we are successful you will be very handsomely rewarded. If you fail-," "But if I refuse?" "It is no good refusing. We have brought you here on purpose, and you must and shall do what we desire. Be- sides, you would surely not be a fool to your own interest." *' But do I understand you that I am to act a part ini a fraud?" "You may understand it that way if you choose, but it is a very innocent fraud, and so I hope you will -give us no trouble, because unless you con- sent-" Here he took her hand in his and gently caressed it. "Unless you consent," he repeated in soft, low musical tone, " we shall be compelled to do that which we shall sincerely regret." Rose shudderingly crept back upon the seat. Although there was a sweet smile playing around his lips, there was a sinister glare in his eyes. Although his touch was as soft as velvet, she felt that it was like the paw of a tiger, and that the claws were but hidden for a while. "If I do not agree?" she gasped out involuntarily, eager, though dreading, to hear the worst. He bent low, so that his lips almost touched her ear, and hissed between his teeth, ' "We shall kill you!" CHAPTER XVI. ABOUT nine o'clock upon the same night that the scene occurred which is described in the preceding chapter a handsome carriage set down its occu- pants in front of the stage door of the Broadway Theatre. One of these occupants was Mr. Briggs, the successful swindler, black- leg, and forger; the other was a young Sand beautiful woman. She was magnificently attired in the most costly silk, which rustled loudly   as she entered the narrow passage leading to the Realms-of Bliss, and the doorkeeper bowed low to her as she passed. As she ascended the stairs she met Mr. Colson, who was all smiles and graciousness, and he skipped briskly on one side to allow her to pass. "The stairs are very dirty," he said. "I must have them looked to." "It's time they were, I am sure," cried the beauty in a gay tone. "It's perfectly unendurable what one has to put up with behind the scenes of a theatre." "It shall be attended to," said Mr- Colson. She 'swept onwards without another word, and bent her steps towards the dressing-room. The carpenters touched their caps and shambled out of the way as she approached.  t Some of the ballet-girls whom she met crept timidly back, and, murmuring among themselves, looked evilly after her. Arrived at one of the dressing-rooms,. by far the best of all, an elderly female opened the door and bobbed a timid curtsy. "Now then," exclaimed the beauty, "be quick if you please-that is, if you can. Is my dress ready? Have you altered it as I directed?' "Yes, madam." "Let me look." "It is here, madam." "It's horrible. It must be undone again. Pull it to pieces at once." "But madam, it is so late, and-" "Well, leave it. However, you shall do it to-night before you go to bed, and bring it to me the first thing in the morning. Then I can have it altered durirg the day if you make any more mistakes." The elderly female humbly bowed her head, and busied herself to the utmost with the beauty's toilet. When she was attired, and stood looking at herself in the glass, her beauty was so dazzling that even the sewing woman, so accustomed to see her, could not help gazing admirably, enviously, upon the transcendent love- liness of this fair andimperious woman. Did-it not seem that such as she were made to be queens, while all others were born to be Ler abject slaves and do her bidding?  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6980-00000032"/> And yet even beauty will fade, and life is uncertain, and death is stealing upon us all-how far off, or how near bo us, who can say? Thus death awaited thislovely woman. A sudden and horrible death. And as she stood there smiling proud- ly she was on the very brink of the grave. She llad barely ten minutes more to live. When she was attired she descended to the green-room. As she entered, there was but one other person present-a pretty woman, attired like herself for the ballet. As the beauty closed the door and ad- vanced towards the fire the other started slightly and changed color. As she did so her hand wandered to hier bosom and seemed to search for something hidden there. 'There was a faint flush, too, upon the face of the new comer as she recog- nised her companion, and she appeared for a moment to hesitate whether or luot she should come into t4le room. However, she decided upon doing so, and slowly approached the fireplace, keeIling her eyes averted from the other woman's face. There was a dead silence of several moments. Then the second woman said in a low and trembling voice, which she vainly endeavored to render firm: ' Have you thought over what I said to you?" "Yes, I have, but this is neither the time nor place to go into the matter." "Excuse me, but it is the place. As for the time, I have already waited far too long." 1"You must wait until it is my plea- sure to speak to you, Clara." "When will that be?" "I cannot say." "' But I must know to-night." i"No." "When, then?" '; Never. I defy you  to do your worst." "Take care, or by Heaven you will repent your rashness. Will you  do what I wiah you?  Mind, thisis the last time I shall ask." "No; I will not, Clara." No other word was spoken. The beauty drew herself up to her full height and looked scornfully down upon her companion.   With lightningrapidity she drew from her bosom a tiny pistol. She presented it at the face of the beauty and fired. With a scream the victim staggered back and fell dead upon the ground. At the samemoment the manager and a score of other persons came rushing terrified into the room, and found her lying there a blood-stained corpse. For a moment there was a pause. A pause and an   awful silence, in which, with white terror-stricken faces, Colson and Briggs stood gazing in hor- ror upon the blood-smeared face of the murdered woman, while a crowd of frightened men and trembling women blocked up the back-ground. She whom the victim had called Clara was the first to speak. In a hoarse whisper she addressed the manager: "' Send them away," she said, "and send for a doctor. Not that it's needed, thorrh,' 'she added to herself. The manager, half frightened out of his wits, did as she bade him. When the door was closed he asked in a trembling voice- "What has happened?" "Look at the door. Is any one lis- tening?" Colson stepped back, and opened it quickly. No one was near the other side. No one can hear us," he repeated, still in a low voice, and still trembling. "What does it all mean? How did she come by her death?" "From   my  hand!" replied  the woman. Briggs, who was kneeling by the side of the corpse, started up at these words, and confronted her with flashing eyes. "Murdress!" he exclaimed. But she met his gaze with contempt- uous indifference. "You choose to call me so," she re- plied. "' But-but how did it happen?" gasp- ed the manager. "I was sitting here alone. She came in and began to quarrel with me. You know the reason. Gradually she work- ed herself up into a fury. Then sud- denly drew a pistol from her breast and tried to take my life. Isnatched the weapon from her. We struggled. She threw me down and endeavored' to strangle me. I pointed the pistol at her face and shot her dead."   There was a deep silence when she thus concluded her narration. The two men stood as though trans- fixed, looking open-mouthed and speech- less into the cold white face of the speaker. "Great Heavens!" cried Colson at last, finding his tongue.  "What will be done?  I shall be disgraced and ruined by the exposure that must fol- low. You will be tried for murder, and "Why?" The men looked at her in amaze- ment. "What do you suppose that you can commit such a crime with impunity, and escape all consequences '" "How   will they know that I have committed the crime?" "How?   Why,by your ownconfession," "What confession?" "Haven't you this moment told us that you murdered her P" "I know I have told you, but I know that it willgo no farther." "But what do you mean { How can it be kept secret!" "Very easily." "Very easily I  Why the doctor is on his way here now. The police, perhaps, are at the very door 1" "Well, and what then t" "The truth will all come out." Not at all. What can they discover ;, "They will find her murdered " "They will find her dead. They will see that she has been shot through the head. By the side of her they will find d lying the weapon with which she did the ' deed." "She did the deed?"  "They will find her own pistol--a pistol l which she is known to be in the habit of ' carrying about with her-which she was 3 seen to have in her possession this very morning." "Well "               a "They will then hear my statement with o respect to the way in which she committed suicide." The msnager listened in a confused way to all this, evidently too frightened to clearly understand what she was saying. Briggs, on the contrary, was deeply at- P tentive tl When she here paused for a  short time he said-                w "  And can you explain as clearly why we w should assist in this scheme ofyours ', "Yes." W' hy?"              S   he  "Because you dare not oppose me." As she spoke she drew herselfup to s- her full height, and her eyes seemed to - gleam with something of the venemous ,e glitter of those of a serpent. There was something terrible in the at face of this beautiful woman, so calm il and yet so cruel. id  Very evidently   the manager was 1- afraid of her, but she had rather a dif- d ferent person to deal with in James Briggs. "I hardly see it in the same light," P- he said. "' You think, perhaps, that be- cause our connection enabled you to n learn a few trifling secrets of my pri- r, vate life you can trade on them to any extent. But you make a mistake. I, for e one, do not fear you." "You do not fear me?" "   No." At this moment footsteps were heard t approaching.  There was a knock at the door. "We   have not a moment to spare now," said Clara.   "We must unde.- t stand one another at once." "' It would be as well." "You refuse to second my story by i your evidence?," , "i I do. You have long enough stood in my  way. This is a good opportunity of removing you. You have brought it , on yourself. Your blood be on you- own head." As he spoke Briggs moved toward the door. But the woman sprang to his i side, and  laid  her hand upon hla w wrist. "James Briggs," she said, in a  low voice, which trembled with the pent-up passion that caused her fair bosom to rise and fall like an angry sea. "I tell you you dare not thwart. me, nor this man either, for I know too much." II Yes, yes," gasped the manager in an appealing tone. "For God's sake don't oppose her!" "What do you know  1" asked Briggs with a  savage frown. "I know you.- "Indeed!" "Yes. Not as the man of fashion you pretend to be, but as the thief and forger that you are.." He started violently and clutched her wrist, but with a sudden effort she wrenched herself free. "More than that I  know,- she said. "More than that?"  he asked with a sudden flush, and the manager, creep-  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6980-00000033"/> ing towards him, laid his trembling hands-upon his arm and whispered with ashy lips- - ' Yes, yes, she knows all!" "All what?" "She knows all about the past." "I know this much," said Clara, ' that you are escaped convicts, that you worked together in the penitentiary, that a reward was offered for your cap- ture, and that if I denounced you-" Again there was a loud knocking at the door. 1"Need I say any more?" she asked. Briggs was silent, and Colson tremb- lingly advanced to admit the doctor, but as hoe passed by Briggs' side he cast upon him an appealing glance filll of piteous entreaty. ' For God's sake don't opposte her!" fit muttered. CHAPTER XVH. MANY weary days passed away, and yet was young Jesse Dumar a prisoner in the lonely house. A very dreary life was it which he passed in that strange abode of crime and misery.- All day long he worked very hard under the direction of the foreman or those left in charge during Samuel Heath's absence. When night came he was so wearied that he waa glad enough to avail hlm- self of the coarse, hard bed provided for him, and sleep off his fatigue. He had never in his life before done a hard day's work, and he by no means relished the sensations which the hard work of the first of these days left be- hind it. When the next day had passe( as laboriously as the first he went to bed very much disgusted. Not so much, though, as hhe was at the end of the next day. or the next after that. When a week had passed miserably away, and he still found himself a pris- oner, still compelled to labor at the orders of the ruffians around him, a, savage rage grew up within his breast, and he swore to himself that he would either escape or die. The ,latter alternative was easy enough. He had only to attempt the former and the latter followed as a mat- ter of course. He did not attempt it. He saw that his every movement was jealously   watched. He knew that it would be worse than useless to make a trial yet. Presently, if lie appeared to be ac- tive and cheerful, they would, perhaps, ' relax their vigilance, and then was the time. With this idea he worked away as hard as lie could, laughed and joked with his fellow-laborers, and to all ap- pearance was happy and jovial. Now  and then, though, when he thought himself unobserved, a pained and wearied expression would creep over his face, and none of these signs passed unnoticed. He fancied, too, that his affectation of contentment deceived them.  But he was much mistaken, for they not un- reasonably argued that such a frame of mind was most unnatural-indeed im- possible. How could he, a young man of fash- ion, accustomed to all the gaities of life, settle down contentedly to work like a slave and live like a dog? It was impossible that he could ldo so80. At the same time it very much puz- zled Jesse Dumar to account for the contentment of the rest How was it possible, he asked him- self, that they could pass all their lives thus hidden away from the world, work- ing night and day, without any pleas- ures or enjoyment, without any earthly prospect of amendment 1 Were they all persons whose lives and liberty would be forfeited if they ventured abroaa t It seemed to him that the tedious misery of the lives they led in this hor- rible place was scarcely preferable to that of a prison. i With the exception of a tolerable supply of butchers' meat and a liberal allowance of wine and spirits, Jesse Du- mar had been ble to see nothing in the treatment of his fellow-workmen which at all differed from that of a band of un- happy wretches locked up for life in a dreary prison house, working  their , hearts out only to increase the wealthl of their cruel task master. What was done with the produce oi their labors T he wondered. Every day large quantities of base coin were manufactured. If these were disposed of for the fourthl of the value of the money they were. intended to represent an enormous profit must be made.   Who, then, reaped the benefit? If it were Briggs alone, it was extra- ordinary that these men consented to live on as they did, and toil for him without any reward. The wonderful part of the business was that they did not break out into open revolt. Certainly they would have done so had they all been as discontented with their lot as he was. And were they not 1? He could not answer for all of them, but he was quite certain of one other besides himself.  Wat it possible that each fearing the rest was the cause of them all suffer- ing in silence when all equally desired to free themselves from the hateful thraldom!  He klew very well that there was one other who desired freedom-who was kept snere against his will. This was the man called Hugh Sey- mour. Very soon Jesse found out that he ,vas meditating an escape. One day he had not been working quite as hard as usual, and when ho lay stretched at night upon his hard com- fortless couch he found he could not go to sleep. Wearily he tossed to and fro, and rolled from side to side in restless fatigue, vainly courting sleep. His companion seemed to be restless also, and appeared annoyed by his fre- quent movements, for he heard him more than once swearing savagely to himself. At last Jesse Dumar resolutely closed his 'eyes and determined not to stir again upon any account. When he had lain silent thus for about ten minutes Seymour rose in his bed in a sitting posture, and coughed. Dumar opened hiseyes without shift- ing his position, and stared at him in astonishment. His companion coughed again, this time louder than before. Then he softly called to Dumar by name. But the young man made no reply. It struck him that Seymour only did Ao to see whether he was asleep, and he therefore lay perfectly still and silent. After a few moments' pause Seymour rose to his feet and began to search  under his mattress.   Then he struck a light and lit a dark lantern.  With this he crept on tiptoe towards i Dumar's bed. The young man shut his eyes, and the other passed the buili's-eye two or three times across his face. "All right," Jesse heard him mutter. "He's off at last, curse him." He then crept away, and presently Jesse heard him fitting a key intofthe lock of the door. It turned easily, and he passed out into the passage, closing the door after him, but not locking it. "Hallo!" thought Jesse to himself. "Is my surly friend off for good? If he is, I'll follrow suit." No sooner said than done. Dumar rose hastily, crammed his shoes into his coat pockets, noiselessly unfastened the door, and followed in the wake of his companion. At the further end of the passage he could just see the reflection of the dark ; lantern. In another moment it had disappear- ed. Dumar worked his way along by the wall very cautiously, for he dreaded to , make the least sound. Reaching the end of the passage, he found a door. Opening it noiselessly, he peeped in and caught a glimpse of the lanternSa rays a good distance beneath him. Clinging to the doorpost, Jesse groped l about nervously until he discovered that a flight of steps lay before him. Holding by the wall, he descended L very cautiously, still keeping the lan- ' tern in view. There was then another passage to ' be explored, and at the end of it there was a bright light, apparently coming from a window in the floor. Such, when he got near enough, he found to be the case. There was a skylight looking upon a large room, and through the glass Hugh Seymour was now peering eagerly. "5 If I could creep round without him seeing me," thought Jesse, "I should like very much to have a peep, too." It was rather a difficult matter; but, with great care and caution, Dumar at length managed to effect his purpose and, hiding himself in the shade, gazed upon the extraordinary scene below. Before him he saw a large luxurLons I yy furnished room, and in it recognized  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6980-00000034"/> his brother coiners-all, however, hand somely dressed-and as many females splendidly attired, all young, and the greater part beautiful. A table in the centre of the room groaned beneath a weight of choice viands, hot-house fruits, and costly wines. Jesse Dumar had already had some experience of the voluptuous orgies in- dulged in by Briggs, and could now un- derstand how it was that this band of ruffians consoled themselves for their life-long imprisonment by wild excess- es and lawless revelries in the society of these syrens, who were, doubtless, ignorant of their companions' real char- acter and occupation. He could have spent some time in wondering astonishment at the luxuries anrolled before hi eyes, but a move- ment on the part of his companion taused him to turn his eyes in Hugh Seymour's direction. He was wandering on again, and Jesse followed, But the bright light at which he had been looking dazzled him. He fancied he heard a door close, but was not quite sure from what direction the sound had come. He began to grope round the walls. He could, however, find no door and no outlet except the passage by which he had come. What was to be done? He waited and listened. The murmur of voices below drowned all other sounds. Still he waited, but as the moments flew past he began to feel nervous. It would not do, he thought, for his friend to retrace his steps to the room and lock him out. The idea made him feel suddenly hot and cold. He felt his way back to the passage, and groped his way along as quickly as he could. He came to the steps, ascended them, opened the door, and felt his way along the other passage on the floor above. With hardly any trouble he reached his door, found it open, entered the room, and went back to bed.    1 He had not been there more than five minutes, at the outside, when Hugh  Seymour  returned, extinguished hia  lamp, and also retired to his couch. Jesse Dumar was very .nuch astonised. t "What the deuce made him take that 1   d- walk?" he asked himself. "It could s, not have been for the pleasure of pcep- he ing down into that room, because lihe did not stop long enough when he was m there. What could he have been ce about?" ly It was difficult to guess, and Hugh Seymour was not likely to unravel the ie mystery. 1- Next night as soon as he went to bed, i- Dumar pretended to be fast asleep, and )f Seymour, after experimenting once or r twice to find out whether or not he'was i- awake, rose cautiously, lit his dark lan- y tern, and stole out of the room in the a, way that he had done the previous - evening. When Jesse was about to rise also and n follow him he fancied he heard his foot- B steps returning, and hastily lay down - again. a  Having waited a while, until all was 1 still, he got out of bed and peeped into the passage. All was dark and silent. He could see nothing of his fellow-prisoner. I  He hurried up the passage as fast as I he could, and opened the door at the t end, but he was not to be seen. IThen he paused and hesitated. He had been mistaken about the footstep, he thought, and by the delay had given Seymour an opportunity of getting too far to be easily overtaken. Under these circumstances, and pain- ful as was the alternative, there was nothing  ,aetter for him than to retrace his steps. When ht got back to his room he seated himself despondingly upon the side of the bed and pondered. "Perhaps I  shall never get another chance," he thought. "It was very un- lucky." But at this moment his attention was attracted toward the ceiling by a faint scratching noise. "What's that, I wonder?" he said to himself. ("It can't be rats surely." The scratching, however, continued, and then suddenly a faint streak of light appeared. Could it be Seymour? IIo sat motionless upon the edge of the bed listening and watching. The streak of light widened. It was a trap-door that was being opened in the ceiling. ' Suddenly a bull's-eve flashed into the room and settled with a glare on his face.   Then a soft female voice asked- "Are you Jesse Dumar e" "Yes," he answered in astonish- ment. "And you are a prisoner?" "Indeed I am." "And wish to escape?" "Need you ask?" "I can help you then." "Ah?" "But only on certain conditions." "Name them," said Jesse eagerly. "You will owe me a debt of gratitude i I again restore you to the world?" "Indeed I shall, and one that I can scarcely ever hope to repay." "You will serve me, then, in return." "However you may dictate." "Very well. I shall try you at any rate, and hope I may not find you un- deserving." With these words the trap-door was closed again, and Dumar resumed his seat in silent astonishment. This feel- ing, however, soon gave place to one of disappointment, as minute after min- ute passed away without his hearing any more of his new friend. Perhaps Seymour would return. What then? Every moment's delay he felt to be more dangerous than the last, and yet the trap door remained closed, and the silence continued. At last, when he was beginning to despair, the trap once more was raised, and the  same soft woman's voice ad- dressed hm. "Will you come now?" it said. "Yes." "You are alone?" "Yes." "Take care, then.  I will let down a  rope ladder. There, have you got "Yes." "Can you climb up it without mak- i ing it fast at your end?" "Oh, yes, easily." "It is fast above; so now come quickly." Jesse waited  for no second invita- tion. He laid tight hold of the ladder I and prepared to climb. But scarcely had lie raised his foot t when a  heavy step behind caused him t to turn his head. The next moment he received a  vio- p lent blow in the face which felled him p to the floor.           s Then  Hugh  Seymour sprang past h   him, rushed up the ladder, and passed through the trap-door, pulling the ropes t- after him.' Half-insensible from the violence of the blow, Jesse was still vaguely con- scious of the sound of a struggle above and a woman's scream. And then all was still. What did it mean? How was it that Seymour had so suddenly returned? Had he really wrested from his grasp all chance of escape?  What had be- e come of the mysterious female who had so strangely offered him her assistance? 1  He staggered to his feet with an ef- fort, and passed his hand to his head, which was throbbing painfully. Whilst he stood thus, he heard the r sound of voices, and the tramp of feet - approaching. He looked wildly around, and with J the aid of the faint light which struggled 9 in between the bars of a tiny grating - high up in the wall, strove vainly to find something which might serve as a - weapon of defenee. The voices and   the footsteps ap- proached nearer. They were in the passage.   They were at the door. Jesse Dumar turned to face them, and clenched his fists ;-- but as he did so a deadly sickness stole ever him. 'He reeled, and, striving in vain to catch at the wall, fell heavily to the ground. Next moment there was a sudden rush of men into the room, and naked daggers and flashing lights surrounded him. CHAPTER XVIII. AROUND' the prostrate form of Jesse Dumar an angry consultation was held by the gang of coiners who had thus rushed in a body into his room. "Down with him!" "Stab him at once!" "No--no; stay awhile." "Why should we spare him " "Perhaps he had no share in it. See, he is wounded." "Seymour  must have done this, then. There has been a   struggle be- tween them." Thus incoherently did the coiners dis- pute among themselves, whilst their prisoner lay perfectly passive in a deep swoon, caused by the loss of blood from his wound.  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6980-00000035"/> Some were in favor of executing himn at once, without the benefit of judge or jury. Ho had never been very popular with the gang, and a greater part of the number were of this way of thinking. Fortunately for him, however, law- less ruffians though they were, these men were governed by laws of their own, and one and all entertained a great respect for the opinions of their chief, Briggs. Therefore, after the first moment's rage was over, they cooled down a lit- tle, and began to talk more reasonably. As it was, they had already got one victim on whom to wreaka bloody ven- geance. Hugh Seymour had been caught, and was now lying, bound hand and foot, awaiting the judgment to be passed upon hm. Mr. Briggs was absent that night and was not expected until late on the fol- lowing evening. Until then he must wait, suffering agonies of suspense. They locked him up in a dark cellar, and left him there without food or water or light, his thongs cutting cruelly into his flesh. All this Jesse learned, when he recov- ered consciousness, from the conversa- tion of those around him, for he had been removed from his former room, and awoke to find himself lying stretch- ed upon some blankets in front of the workroom fire. He also learned that the mysterious female had not been discovered, nor her presence suspected. Throughout the day Jesse lay very weak and faint, but he recovered a little of his lost strength as night came on. He needed it all to be able to bear the horrible sight which was in store for him. Not until two or three hours after the cvening's work was concluded did Mr. Brigg make his appearance. T'heband then allsolemnly assembled in t] workroom. priggs occupied a raised seat. Bring Jesse Dumar here," he said, and two of the men helped the prisoner to walk forward; then seated him near Briggs. "What do you know of Seymour's treachery?"Briggs asked, sternly. "Nothing," replied Jesse, in a calm voice. 'Nothing '"   "I was not in his confidence." "It was from his hand that you re- ceived your wound?" "Yes." "Had you been struggling together t" "No." "How did it occur then?" "He came upon me from behind, and struck me suddenly." "Ah, to prevent your hindering him from escaping. Was that so?" Jesse was silent. I He had no intention of betraying the real truth, and left them to come to what conclusion they thought fit. Briggs was silent for a time; then continued- "You were aware that he left the room of a night?" "Yes." A murmur arose among the coiners at this reply. "Youwere? When didhedo so first?" "I do not know." "When did you first know of it?" "Last night." "Do you know what he did when he left the room!" "No. I was not in his confidence." "Do you swear that this robbery and escape was not planned between you i" "Yes. I swear it was not.7" "Were you to have no part in the plunder?" "No. I never heard that there was any plunder to divide."   / Another silence followed. Then Briggs and the coiners consult- ed together, and appeared to come to some conclusion not altogether favora- ble towards the young prisoner. When they had talked for a while in a low tone of voice Briggs resumed his seat and ordered Hugh Seymour to be brought out. There was a long delay, which passed in solemn silence. Jesse Dumar's heart throbbed with apprehension--not from any fear upon his own account, but a horrible dread of what was in store for the unhappy traitor. His fears for him, though, could not have anything like equalled the poor wretch's fears for himself. He was ghastly white. His teeth chattered in his head and his knees smote together. They brought him in, still bound, and stood him opposite to his judge. When they relinquished their hold of   him, however, he rocked to and fro in I such a helpless way that it seemed cer- tain he would have fallen on his face Chad they not caught him by the arms. "Hugh Seymour," said Briggs, in a low but solemn tone, " you have been brought here to be tried by our band. I will ask you a few questions, which you need not answer unless you choose. First of all, have you been well treated since you have been with us?" "I never wished to remain here. I have been kept against my will." "That may ornot be true. You pro- fessed to join us of your own free will. We doubted you and kept you for a probationary period as a sort of prison- er. It is a rule that we all observe. In return you plundered us." "I only took a little." "You robbed us, or attempted to do so. You also attempted to escape. Who assisted you?" "A woman." "Do you know who she was?"   1 "No."           9 "How wgn it she assisted you then " . "I do not know.  She held the lad- der for me, and told me which way to x go."                I "When you were taken what became otf her?" "I do not know." They asked no more, but consulted h among themselves for some minutes. g When again Briggs addressed the prisoner, his tone was even more solemn  than before. "You   have offended  against our t laws," he said, L and you must die." Seymourgasped as heheard the words u "Oh, for God's sake don't murder me!" he cried in piteous accents. m And dropping down on his knees he gr rocked himself to and fro in terror. "There is no hope for. you," replied th Briggs sternly. "You must die."   l "Oh, mercy! mercy!"       te "We have no mercy for traitors." m The unhappy wretch worked himself along on his knees until he  reached to Briggs' feet, and gazed into his face,= th with an agonized expression.    he "You won't let them kill me, Briggs;,  he whined.  " I am sure you won't let an them murder your old friend. We have fro known   one another so long. And my pretty daughter, too. You loved her, gr Briggs, once, but she was a silly, flighty  girl, and did not know what honor y u for *r   in conferred on her; ut she wouldn't listen 3r- to me."  " Briggs turned away with an expres- is. sion of contempt, and made a sign to I a some of the men. en Obedient to it, they opened a large d. trap in the floor-the same over which 3h Jesse Dumar had stood when they 5e. threatened his life upon the first night ed of his entry into the coiners' abode. Then some one pulled a cord, and a I rumbling, plashing noise was heard, which sounded very awful in the death- like sile. When I reached the ears of their vic. tim he shrieked and covered his eyes. "- Not that!" he screamed. "Ob-! not n that! Do not murder me so brutally.," "There is no choice for you. That is the death which we award to all trai- Lo tors." D.  "No, no! You cannot mean to do it. You will not do it. I shall be broken to pieces. I shall be torn from limb to limb." Briggs, however; heeded not his pray- ' ers and entreaties. He waved his hand, and two of the o men approached the victim and raised him to his feet. He, however, would not or could not stand. His knees gave way under him, and I he  sank seemingly  helpless to the ground. Then they raised him again and drag- tged him towards the mouth of the pit. As he approached its brink- his face turned to a livid color. Great beads of perspiration burst out upon his forehead. His teeth chattered horribly, and he moaned dismally like some animal in great pain. When he had come to the opening,  though, and could see down into the black and yawning chasm below, his terror and agony reached their cli- max. Summoning allhis strength, he sprang to his feet, and wrested himself from the grasp of the men who had been holding him. But his hands and arms were bound and he could do nothingto save himself from the fearful fate in store for him. Very soon again he was in their grasp. Then they once more dragged-him forward.  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6980-00000036"/> He plunged, and kicked, and scream- ed, but they passed a rope around his body and knotted it tightly. Then they raised him in their arms and poised him over the trap. By this time he had shrieked himself hloarse. His voice was scarcely louder than a whisper. But his face was fearful to contem- plate, such bitter agony did it express. He had to deal, though, with men of iron hearts, and they paid no attention to the terrors of the shivering wretch. Balancing him for a moment they hurled him suddenly forward. His body fell with a heavy thud upon a revolving water-wheel below. An instant afterwards there was a lhideous, crushing sound, and then another and another, and then the same splashing, bumping noise which previously was audible. "Close the trap," said Briggs. He was obeyed. "Look to the other prisoner." They crowded round Jesse Dumar, who had slipped from his chair and lay in a swoon upon the floor. They raised him and carried him back to the temporary bed that had been made for him with the aid of a few old ragged blankets, and here he lay, white and motionless like a corpse. Several hours passed away. The band had betaken themselves to their several orgies in the banqueting room below--all save an old man, who had volunteered to sit by the fire and watch the sick captive. Jesse slumbered fitfully, and fright- ful dreams haunted his restless couch. The old man, weary of his long vigil, and sleepy with the hot fire, began to nod in the chimney corner. A profound silence reigned in the up- per part of the house, in the workrooms and the chambers adjoirning, and the distant portion of the apartment in which Jesse lay on his bed was filled with healped-up shadows, grimly and ghastly. From out tl I pitchlly darkness a form came stealthily-a cloaked figure, creep- ing, witlh noiseless tread, upon the slumbering watch. Poor wretch, he dreamced not of his danger. He smiled in his sleep, and mumbled softly to himself: The dark ligluntr crept closer still. Its upraised hand cluched a knife.   The old man in his sleep moved Ids position and the figure sprang quickly back. Then waited and watched in an awful silence. Not the faintest sound was to be heard, except the shivering of the ci?- ders as they seemed to shudder upon the hearth. And now he slept again, and once more the phantom stole upon him. Once more the knife was raisedin the air. This time it fell with deadly pur- pose. The old man half rose from his seat, uttering an inarticulate cry, then came down heavily upon his face and lay a corpse upon the hearth. The figure stooped over him hastily, and laid a hand upon his shoulder. "Dead!" said a woman's voice, in a low hissing whisper. "Now for the other." As she spoke she crept towards Jesse Dumar, and, kneeling by his side, shook him again and again. The sick man languidly opened his eyes and stared at her unmeaningly. "Wake up! Wake up!" she whis- pered.         " "What is it?" "Escape." "Escape?" "Yes. There is not a moment to be lost. If you come now we can get away unobserved." "Get away" repeatedJesse. "How? We shall be caught, and then--Ah! the trap. Where have they put him?" "Don't stay talking here of traps, you fool," said the woman, angrily. "'Are you mad? I offer you liberty. Will you accept it?" "Yes, yes." He struggled to his feet as he spoke. He was weakl and giddly, and clung to the objects around to steady him- self. "What is the matter?" asked the woman. "Come along." She did not seem to know he was wounded, or to notice the linen band age on his heald. "Are you ready?" she asked, pres ently. "Yes, yes." "Come, then. Hold my hand." He did as she bade him, and, with a tremenldous effort, collected something of his lost strength and steadied him- self: Then he followed her.   She led him along through the work- room, down a passage, and another and another, by a flight of stairs, and out into a yard. He was still giddy and bewildered, and like one in a dream. Slle led him through a neglected garden and across a shrubbery, through "gap in the hedge, and out into a lane beyond. There was a carriage waiting. She told him to get inside, and he obeyed mechanically. Then she followed, and in silence they drove away. He might have fallen asleep or swoon- ed upon the road. At any rate he took no notice of the course the vehicle pursued, and only aroused himself at last when the car- riage stopped in front of a small cot- tage, standing by a roadside, and hav- ing a broad, open marsh land in its rear. "We will get out here," said the 3 woman. Jesse obeyed.           1 "Now, follow me." She entered the cottage.  "Now, you can lie down on that bed i for a time, and rest yourself. You won't be wanted till the day after to- t morrow. Be ready then."      8 "For what?" "You will learn when the time n comes." 'With these words she left him in charge of a lman who appeared to be a o cut between a gamer and a poacher. t This person, although of rough mgn- ner and appearance, tended him kindly,  -providing him with medicines, and h other necessaries. Several times did Jesse endeavor to draw him into con- a versation, but to each query his wary nurse only replied with an evasive n answer. Thus wearily enough the next day h and night passed away, until the time at last arrived which Jesse Dumar's si lmysterious liberator had fixed upon for tc the performance of the unnamed service a she required at his hands.     he CHAPTE   R XIX.     ye UPON this very morning, and almost w at 1he same hour, our heroine, Rose be Seymour, on rising from her couch at of the strange house to which she had au been taken after making her escape fom the theatre, found a disguise wait-   k- inmg for her to put on, in which she was 'r, to act an unknown part in some strange id comedy, of the plot of which she had no knowledge. a, Dumarawoke from his slumbers and found that during the night his clothes ;d had been removed, and in their place ;h another suit substituted. e  It was a servant's livery-the dress of a groom--and consisted of tight-fitting body coat, leather breeches, boots with e dark brown tops, a hat, and a cockade. "In for a penny in for a pound " ob- y served Dumar to himself. "I migHt' as well be hanged for an elephant as a - hedgehog. It won't hurt me any the more." e He turned the garments over and over y and hesitated about beginning his toilet. But his jailor quickened his move- - ments by knocking at the door, and - calling out to know whether he was not 3 nearly ready. "In half a minute," responded Du- ) mar. Then, without further delay, he scram- bled into the clothes. When he was ready the man came and opened the door and told him to follow.; They went together outside the cot- tage, where a horse was waiting ready saddled. "You can ride, I suppose?" said the man. "Yes, I can." "Get on, then, and trot up to the end of that lane. You'll find your mistress there waiting for you." Sure enough, at the end of the lane was a lady on horseback waiting to see him. She regarded him attentively as he approached. "Youmake a good groom," she re- marked, with a smile. hi"hhank you," replied Dumar, touching "Address me respectfully when you speak,'; she said in a low but threatening tone. "We shall have an opportunity for a little private conversation perhaps in an hour or two, and then weshall understand each other better. At present remember you are my servant." Dumar bowed. He would not for the world have offended this imperious beauty, being only too anxious to see a little more of her, and learn something of the mystery surrounding her. "Hold this," she said, passing him a box. Dumar did as she desired.  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6980-00000037"/> "Take care of the case; I shall want them directly." "What thw?"Ah I he knew now, It was a case of duelling pistols. She rode on at a brisk pace in front of him, and he followed, deep in thought. They rode on silently for about half an hour, at the end of which time they reached a low fence, over which the lady leaped her horse. Dumar followed, and, crossing a large field, they approached a small but thick wood. Again leaping a fence, they entered the thicket, and made their way onward at as rapid a pace as the growth of the under- wood would permit of. Whentheyhad proceeded for about a couple of hundred yards or so they arrived at an open space. Here two persons were awaiting them. One was mounted on horseback like Jesse Dumar's beautiful companion; the other was a young groom. Jesse's lady rode up to the other, and, bowing, said in a cold voice: "You see, madam, I have come." "I see." "But wonder, perhaps.  You did not expect me?' "Scarcely." "That mray, perhaps, account for your own punctuality," said Clara, with a sneer- ing smile. ' Perhaps." '; Since we have met, however, and since wo kllow exactly what we have come for, why waste any more time? "I think that quite sufficient has been wasted already. We might have settled our difference a week ago in town." "No , I think not,' said Clara, LC as our difference can only be settled by the death of one of us. 1Iatl one killed the other in town at the time you first proposed the meeting, the survivor would have had a great deal of trouble in effecting her escape." "That is true." "Here, on the contrary, we can arrange matters differently." "How? "We are out of earshot. The sound of our pistols, shonld they even chance to be heard by any one in the fields, will attract no attention. The servant I have brought with me can be thoroughly trusted. I pre. sume, also, that you have made a judicious selection?" "Yes, yes. She-he, I mean--can be trusted perfectly." '"So much the better. The body of the one who is killed can be left here in the wood. Concealed in a ditch, it may easily   ; iu. V U 1.K be unobserved for many days, until, indeed, it is no longer recognisable." The other woman shuddered slightly. "I myself have taken care that none of the linen I came in should bear any mark by which it might be known. You, too, I suppose, have taken care?" "Yes." "Shall we see to the arms, then?" "If you please." "The safest and most satisfactory method would be, I think, for each to load her own pistol." "Yes." At this point of the conversation Clara beckoned to Jesse Dumar, and he brought forward the box containing the arms and ammunition. The other followed her example, but with some slight traces of agitation about her pale and faltering fingers. "My mistress is very marvellous," thought Jesse. "A plucky one, too, and no mistake. I shall back her as thelconqueror. But the other poor girl! It's an awful shame--in fact, I'm not quite certain that it isn't murder." He had gone through so much lately that he had got to be not over squeamish.6 He had plenty to occupy his attention in watching the arrangements.   k The other lady's groom, too, son}hat excited his curiosity. A youthful groom, without any sign of beard or whisker. A groom whose back hair was rather pe- culiarly arranged, as though it were so long that he was obliged to turn t le ends up and plant his hat securely on his head to keep it straight. Still more noticeable, a groom with very soft hands! and last of all, and strangest of all, with a plain gold ring/on the third finger of his left hand. Under these circumstances, and taking all these peculiarities into consideration, Dumar began to lhave some slight doubts whether it was not also this person's first appearance in the character of a groom. "C And what was he in his place, I won- der!" thought Jesse. "Hardly anything in the coining way, I should think. What could he have been, unless-unless, to be sure, he was a lady's maid?" The preparations were by this time com- pleted. The two ladies dismounted and gave their horses to their grooms. Thenll they chose their ground, took their positions, and presented their pistols at each other, with what seemed to Dumar to be a very careful aim. "You give the word," said Clara.   Her antagonist nodded. A moment afterwards she said, ' Fire!" At the same timnie she discharged her pis- tol. An instant afterwards Clara fired here. Then, with a shrill cry her antagonist fell to the ground. At the sight Dumar sprang forward to assist her, but his mistress laid her hand gently but firmly on his arm. "Stay." He looked at her In amazement. "Am not I " he stammered, "No," she answered. "There is no need of your help. She does not require it." :' But-bu t-" The female groom, stooping over the lady's prostrate form, at this moment uttered a loud exclamation of terror. "She is dead," she cried. "I told you so," observed Clara, with fiendish smile. "Now assist me into the saddle." Dumar did as he was ordered, moving as though he were in a dream. The other groom, stooping over the bodyof her mistress, now turned, and,  pointing her finger at Clara, said- "Your secret is safe with me, madam.  You may feel certain that justice will not reach you by anything that I shall  say of this morning's work, but God's vengeance will follow you sooner or 1 later. TIhat you cannot escape." Clara laughed and tossed her head,  and then, plying her whip, rode slowly a away. Dumar lingeredfor a moment and then followed her. "I beg your pardon, madam,"' he  said, as he approached her, " are we to h leave her thus?" "What would you do?"       P This, however, Duntlmar had a difficulty  in  finding an answer for. "You are not desirous, I suppose, of w getting hangedC on Lher account?" y' They rode on silently after this. They reached the cottage again in v; about half an hour, and thile poacher- ri looking manll came out to meet them. tl "hMy servant will stay with you, Joe, hI for a fiew hours," she said. "You wrill see that ho wants for nothing. Do you sr hear? Look after him. "        8h The man nodded, and then Clarn     : with a smile and a wave of the hand, m rode away.              ha Dumar followed the m  an into the in house, wondering what w  as going to  pa happen next.             Clp He little dreamt, however, what was m:   coming. He felt rather cold, and stooped over the fire to warmhishands. is- Suddenly, however, he was clutched ed round the throat. He exerted himself and struck out, but bell could not rid himself of his assailant. The poacher had " put on the hug." to He hugged 0so hard that Jesse felt himself nd suffocating. The blood rushed into his face. His eyes seemed starting from his head. At last he became unconscious. When he recovered he was lying on his id back on a very dirty mattress in a damp room, something like a back-kitchen. Trying to raise his hand to his aching le head, he was astonished to find that his it wrists were in handcuffs. , "What is going to happen to me now?"' he asked himself, and in spite of his suffer- h ings he could not refrain from a faint smile. CHAPTER XX. Accompany us to a imagnificent draw- e ing-room in a handsome house in White [, street. Two persons are present. They are Briggs and Clara St. John. 1 It is night, and a fortnight after the 1 events recorded in the last chapter. Briggs was evidently in a rage. The "Iady, as usual, cold and sarcastic. She was lolling negligently upon a sofa. He pacing the room with rapid strides. Suddenly he paused before her, "Clara," he  exclaimed, fiercely, "I will be obeyed. So come, now, no more nonsense. Those jewels I will and mu st  "Find them and take them, " she re- plied, rising, . Give them to you I will "not. "Will not? Do you think to play with me? You forget who I am to whom you refuse obedience., "I know well enough--Pierre Du- val, the forger and escaped convict, the rich man about town, the lucky gambler, the undetected swindler, and my-my husband, alas for me!" "Lucky gambler, fool!," he exclaimed , starting up and clasping her fair white shoulder roughly with his heavy hand. "I tell you, woman, my luck has gone, my  skill has failed me. I have lost all I had this very night, and as for the coin- ing, you know that every channel for passing the money has been suddenly closed. I have lost my credit, my honor, my name--nay, my life, too, for aught I  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6980-00000038"/> know. They are after me this minute." A"The old story," she sneered, moving away and going towards the door. "'You nreed not have disturbed me at such an hour to repeat the same old tale." "Clara, I swear to you it is true," he shouted. And rushing after her, he seized her arm, and swung her around, dashing her head with such violence that she staggered and almost fell. "I have lost every cent I had, I tell you, and have given my bill for twenty-five hun- dred, which if I cannot take up to-morrow my credit is irretrievably gone. If you care nothing for me, think of your own interest, and do not let a paltry consideration of these 1 w jewels stand between you and thousands 'i Perhaps,;: she sneered. As she spoke Briggs stooped his ashy- white face and tried to look into his wife's eyes. But there was no tenderness in the act. Even as he did so his lips quivered with ilerec anger. "Duval," answered the calm, beautiful woman, showing nothing of the rage within her, "from the moment that you brought me to your house as your wretched wife you have lied to me. Why should I believe you now? ' And she looked him full in the face. "I cannot," she continued, a moment afterwards, turning  away with disdain. NTo, I cannot believe you. I do not. Your h-llole life with me has been but one lie and ly 3your former life I judge you." ' Then vyou refuse the diamonds?" I do." Y' You abandon me to my fate?" She shrugged her shoulders mechanically in reply. For a  few moments there was utter still- ness in the room. Clara sat silently regarding the fire. Briggs leaned against the mantle- I piece, his dark eyes fixed with sullen atrocity on his wife's face. It was the lull before the storm. Suddenly he started up. Then  springing  upon the fragile e woman  as a   tiger on its prey, he put  both his hlands on her shoulders, bend- a intg her down under his weight. "Listen to me, woman. I   will search t for the diamonds, as you tell me, and if I   find them not, look to yourself; for I swear it shall be the worse for you l" She made no answer.          ( ", I  lhave lied to you, have I !" he con- s tinllled, angril]. -This shall be the ^   "first example of the truthfulness Pierre g Duval gives you. Beware of it!" a  Then he strode from the room, and, a as she turned haughtily to look after him, she heard the door locked on the e outside. "Search,f' she muttered, with a , scornful smile. "Search, my loving I husband, but you'll not find. Your I wife's jewels shall never deck the per- son of her infamons rival. No, no. I , have already cleared from my path two - women who stood in my way, but not through any jealousy. If, however, it is for her-" Suddenly a stealthy foot crept along the passage outside the door nearest to her sofa. A voice muttered softly: "Mrs. Briggs." Then the footsteps retreated more quickly than they had come. Somewhat startled, Clara rose from her seat and hurriedly picked up a packet, which contained a key and a few words:- "For Heaven's sake be on your guard. Give up the jewels without a struggle. Briggs is desperate, and the ' Beautiful Fiend' is urging him on!" The blood rushed to her face as she read. "Give up the jewels?" she murmured. "t Give them up to that wretch? Never, never! come what may." Again she looked at the paper, and now, for the first time, it struck her that there was something strange in being warned in such a manner. The writing was not that of a common person. The letters were sharp and angular. Who could have learnt her private affairs --her husband's t Who had entered the house at such an hour? it must have been a stranger. "I must go and see. I have never yet feared to face man or woman. Then why now T'" With a trembling hand, in spite of her daring, flashing eye, she lit her lamp, and gathered up her skirts to move noiselessly as possible. She then unlocked the door and entered the passage. Not a  sound was to be heard. All the lamps had been extinguished hours ago and there was something in the dark stillness of the gloomy house which struck with a ghastly chill on the young wife's heart.   JLV Ai Uo1 Softly and slowly Clara passed through the long passages. Nothing disturbed the stillness. Not a ray of light but the tiny one shed by her own lamp, broke on the intense darkness. Up stairs she went, through .room after' room.  Suddenly she paused. She had trodden on something. A very small kid glove. Tiny as Clara's hand was, that glove was too small for it. She flung it down as though it had been X venemous reptile. On she went. A sound caught her ear. A distant sound, but distinct enough to direct her steps towards her own bed- rtoom. More quickly now did Clara's noise- less feet pass along the thick carpets. In a moment more she had reached the door leading to her own  apart- ments. It stood wide open, and there within she saw a sight which filled her with rage. The  wax  tapers standing on the splendid toilet table were all alight, and in the chair in which not two hours ago she herselfhad sat lounged a woman -a small, beautiful woman-with great dark, glowing eyes, whose wonderful lustre and equally wonderful wicked- ness had gained for their possessor the name of the "Beautiful Fiend." She was bending over the arm of the t chair, watching the operations of Briggs 1 as he knelt on the floor, ransacking the I contents of a box, and Clara could see ] that those dreadful, beautiful eyes of hers watched for the appearance of the ' jewels with an eagerness which was even more intense than her compan-  ion's.  "They were for her, then.   He told me a lie," Clara murmured fiercely to herself. "I told you they wouldnot be there," I said the Beautiful Fiend, in a  voice loud enough to show that she cared little who might be within hearing, "You may be quite sure that they are P safer than where mere locks and keys e could make them. Briggs, you are a fool to go on wasting your time about the box."  "What would you have me do?" he replied sharply.          h The beautiful woman thrust out her u white arlm, glittering already with one   magnificent bracelet, and pointed over her shoulder. "You are a man, and can't force a wo- man to find her tongue," she said, sarcas- tically. "You don't know her," sulkily replied ' Brings. "Introduce me to her, then. Pll wager all her diamonds I'll make her say where they are." ' You could not, I tell you. She would a sooner part with her life. She has told me so." 1 Then take her at her word," hissed the Beautiful Fiend, advancing her face to- ward him. There was a moment's silence. L  "How much longer are you going to de- lude me with promises?  How long am 1 to wait for the jewels?" Thus she continued in the same hissing tone, with her splendid eyes glaring like a demon's. "How much longer is that woman, that obstinate, silly wife of yours to stand in my way?" "Madge--trust " said Briggs, half-en- treatingly. "I won't trust. A promise is a promise. You must choose between her and me, and there's an end of it. You've got your an- swer, Mr. Briggs." She rose from her seat, drew her mantle over her shoulders, and turned haughtily away. But at the same instant the wife of Mr. Briggs came with great stateliness into the room, holding the lamp above her head, and looking with fearless eyes at her treacherous husband and her beautiful rival. A moment the latter looked with dis- may at the wife. With a shriek of deadly passion, she sprang upon Clara, clasping her throat with her hands. Clara fell. Briggs stirred not. "The jewels!" hissed   the Beautiful Fiend in Clara's ear, as she struggled on the floor.  " Give me the jewels, or I will strangle you!" Those tiny hands clasped with deadly power. "  Will you give them to me?" demand- ed Madge. Clara moaned. Her husband, pale as a corpse, crept forward. "  Give them up," he said, in an excited, hoarse voice. "  For your life, give them up I She is a fiend. I cannot restrain her." "  Woman," gasped the wife, as the fin.  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6980-00000039"/> gers were relaxed for a moment, t I will show you where they are-I will not give them to you." "On your oath t" Then she suffered Clara to raise herself, saying: "What has been done once can be done twice if you should attempt to play me "Have no fear," replied Clara, with a ghastly smile, as she arranged her dress, with fingers still trembling from the late struggle. "I tell you no lie. I will show you alone the place." "Very well," said the other, quickly.- After all, to give them to me is the most direct way. Madam, I am at your ser- vice." With a mocking bow she pointed to the door and caught up her robe, ready to follow. Clara took the lamp. "You will await me here!" she said to Briges. 't Yes, yes I Make haste with all this tomfoolery." "Then come I' They went out together, the wife and her beautiful rival. On they went, through the silent house, down passages, through suites of rooms, down staircases, until they reached the large hall. Clara walked to a spot above which was hung a full-length painting. Reaching her hand to the edge of the frame, she pushed. Immediately the picture slowly ascend- ed and a large opening appeared in its place. Without a word Clara entered this, fol- lowed by her companion, and led the way along a narrow passage to a flight of stone steps. "I Are you still determined?' she said, as descending the step, they reached a plat- form, balustraded from what appeared by the feeble light of the lamp to be a deep abyss. The beautiful rival gazed around her, dismayed. There was something so mocking about Clara's cold smile that she tossed her head and said: "I follow." Clara turned immediately, and, holding up the light, sought carefully along the brick wall against which the platform was built. To any other eye that wall was a black mass of rough brick; .but Clara's hand touched without hesitation a certain spot.   Then, almost before she could draw her ) breath, the whole of the apparent brick. work descended. They now found themselves opposite a large, iron-plated door. Again Clara's magic finger went to its work of pressing; the door turned on its hinges. This disclosed a flight of steps, which seemed to descend into thb very bowels of the earth. "Come," said Clara, sternly, "they are close at hand." Down, down they went. "There," said Clara, with a faint smile, as they found themselves before an iron door.  "The people to whom this house once belonged knew how to secrete their valuables, did they not?" Madge shivered slightly. "The jewels," she exclaimed sharply. Clara took a small key from a velvet rib- bon hanging round her neck, and put it in the lock. The iron door rolled slowly on its hinges, disclosing a square vault, built of strong brick, and impervious to either damp or light. Two small iron chests stood at the end of the vault. "There are the jewels," she said, pointing to one of the chests. "Take them." Madge clutched hold of her dress. "Come in with me, I will not hurt you." Clara entered calmly, and stood by while the other opened the chest, and the light at the same moment gleaming into it, disclosed a circle of magnificent diamonds. With an exclamation of admiring delight the Beautiful Fiend turned with wild impet- uosity towards the jewels. Utterly absorbed by her greediness to snatch at the wealth she had so long coveted, she forgot her distrust of her companion. She started forward, almost burying her- self in the glittering gems. Suddenly, though, she raised herself, with a sharp, \\ ild cry. She tried to turn from the iron box. But her two round snowy   arms were strained down from within, cagiht firmly by a concealed spring. It was an ingenious trap to catch thieves. "For Heaven's sake," she shrieked, " have mercy on me!" Clara laughed. "Have mercy I have mercy I Keep your husband, keep your jewels-only release me!" "I  will. I will grant you the mercy you would have given me.    You know what that was." She turned away.   The wretched woman uttered another scream. She endeavored to wrench her limbs fom that iron grasp. "You will not leave me here? I shall die. Devil that you are, do not let me die by inches-buried alive. Oh, Pierre, Pierre!" But her shrieks echoed only under the deep earth. No ear but the frozen one of Clara heard them. She was a judge and avenger. "Listen," she said, flashing her lamp on her agonized victim's face. "Your doom is fixed. There is no mercy for you on earth." The woman moaned. "You pray to one whom your conduct has turned into a torturing demon. Your hour has arrived. I am determined to be revenged." Then stooping and picking up the dia- mond circlet at the wretched woman's feet, she flung it scornfully round her head. Snatching the glittering jewels from the chest, she threw them on her bare shoul- der. "When he comes to find you," she said, "he will find you a glittering corpse-a gorgeous spectre." In vain the lost wretch strained those white arms.  1 Pitiless monster-to go smiling back to her husband and say that his mistress had 1 gone home with her jewels, and sent her love to him. "What do you mean t What has be- come of her?"             a "What I say."            t "She is gone?"  "t Yes.) i "Where?" t Home."               r "That is strange.,' ' He moved to the door. She smiled.             b She listened and heard the street-door I cose. She put on her hat and cloak, and left h the house. CHAPTER    X XXI. A  DARK history was that of the wedded ex fife of the swindler calling himself Mr. Briggs and the ballet-dancer calling her- self Clara St. John, but in reality being at his wedded wife, the wife of an escaped convict.                an   I -  v v -.&amp; *            ' D er  Through many lands had they travelled together. bs  Many daring frauds and robberies had they committed. " The profits of their rogueries had been e great. e  It would be difficult to say which had first helped him on his way through life, e his smooth tongue, or her wit and pretty face. d   - He was scoundrel enough to trade with her beauty, and perhaps did. He sprang up suddenly a fashionable a gentleman living in great style. I He came with letters of introduction 1 from the first society and he was soon one of the lions of NewYork. His wife was one of the reigning t beauties After a while he suddenly disappeared. Nothing was said against him. No scandal was attached to his name. Some extensive forgeries had been per- i petrated successively, and the forgers had rbaffled all attempts to discover them. There was not the faintest connection established between their crime and the sudden  disappearance of the handsome nobleman. Very soon after that a fashionable gentleman and his handsome wife made their appearance, and soon became exten- sively popular. Some unknown persons committed large frauds just about the same time in that city. It was so again at Boston, Chicago, and at New York. Disappearing suddenly from each, there arises almost always immediately after they are gone a great cry, and a great, but unavailing, search. Awful thefts have been committed. Daring forgeries, extraordinary burgla- ries, villanies of all kinds, but the thieves nowhere to be found. In course of time New York is honored by the presence of the distinguished Mr. Briggs. He gives choice little parties, as we have seen. He is said to be a bachelor and a roue. Through his instrumentality a young and lovely lady makes her debut aspremze, dansemus at the Broadway Theatre. She is very beautiful, very graceful, an exquisite dancer.' Everybody falls madly in love with her. Rich men lay their hearts and fortunes at her feet. But she turned away from them in scorn, and they eyed Briggs with jealous anger,  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6980-00000040"/> for the beautiful dancer smiled upon him -so the gossips of the green-room in- timated. He however, as has been said, bore the reputation of being a roue, a reputation wh ich he certainly did his best to maintain. Strange was it, then, that the beau- tiful Clara was not at all jealous. Whispers went abroad concerning his intrigue with the beautiful Nina- %who committed suicide by blowing out her brains. There are always evil tongues and there were not wanting among Clara's enemies some who hinted darkly at murder. The alleged motive was jealousy. Still it was not believed. A jury came to a different opinion, and after the orthodox nine days' won- der the affair was forgotten. About the ninth day, too, there was something else to talk about. There was another suicide. This time a rich young lady, the heiress to a great property, committed suicide in a little wood, not far from the metropolis. She also was shot by a pistol. There was a very great difference be- tween the spheres in which the dead wo- men had moved, and yet they were in some way remotely connected. The name of the same man was brought into question upon each occasion. It was a name which, previous to the first nine days alluded to, had been occu- pying public attention. It was the name of a young man of fashion, a rather profligate and extrava- gant young man, deep in the Jews' books, who had suddenly and mysteriously dis- appeared. He was called Jesse Dumar, and was a friend of Brigga. Some said he had run away with a cer- tain lady of fashion who at that time hap- pened to be suddenly missing, and it was through jealousy that Nina committed suicide. Others said he had run away from his creditors. But when the second lady died he might have come back, for he was her next of kin and at her death the estates became his. It was said that he was in love with a ballet girl at the Broadway and offered to marry her. ,Now that he was a man of property why did he not return? Whatever his reason might be, he cer-   IM. U. S. tainly did not come back, or make a sign -though he was advertised for and de- tectives searched for him. At last there was a very general impres- i sion that he was dead, and the next cf kin began to congratulate himself upon his good fortune. But he was premature. All this time, although Jesse could not be produced, preparations were ; being made in a certain house in the suburbs for producing a very fine imi- l tation of that dashing young gentle- 3 man's face and figure, A grey-headed old gentleman, with a sweet smile and cold, cruel, grey eyes, and a dark-browed young man, his companion, could have told thepisome- thing of that little schemU ' Fortune had thrown into their path a certain pretty ballet-girl, with whom we are already acquainted, At the first glance they had been both struck by the extraordinary like- ness existing between Rose Seymour and Jesse Dumar, in spite of the differ- ence in their sex. To coax her to act the character seemed to them by no means a difficult task. Thus far we think we have now ex- plained some matters which before may have appeared to the reader so myste- rious as to be almost unexplainable. CHAPTER XXII. When Briggs left the house he called a hack and directed the man to proceed to Madge's house. But when he reached there he was as. tonished to find it dark and desolate. He rang the bell. There was no answer, and he rang once more. A very sleepy-eyed servant-maid came to answer. "Is your mistress within?" "No, sir." "Ah, she has not got here yet. I will wait for her." "Certainly. You expect her V" "Yes." The servant showed him into a hand- some drawing-room, lit a lamp, and left him. He waited an hour and yet she did not come. Then he started up, put on his hat and without speaking to the servant, left the house.   He was in a frenzy. "One of the two has played me false," he mattered between hm clenched teeth. "Whidever it be, she shall pay dearly for her treachery." He called a coach and rode to White street. When he reached the house he let him- self in with his latch-key and ran hastily up stairs. The servants had n)t risen. The lights were burning in the draw- ing room, but his wife was nowhere to be seen. He hurried to her bed-chamber. There also the lights burnt brightly.- The contents of the boxes and drawers lay scattered about in confusion, as he had left them. Clara was not to be seen. He descended once more to the draw- ing-room. He strode up and down the length of the floor. "What does it mean? Where have they gone to!" As he could learn nothing until one. of i the two returned to tell him, he sat down to wait with what patience he could mus- ter. "Unless I have those jewels the first thing in the morning, they will be of no use to me." Then he arose and   began to pace the room again. "Where could the    cat have hidden b them I   I wish I had followed and had watched.   I never dreamed Madge would play me false." He swore a fearful oath.       tl "They were in league together. I see it all now. Why should I wait any long- er? And yet-yes, I   think I had better wait. Clara could never mean to leave me t like this. We have quarrelled often before and she has come round. Oh yes, she will come round."              t On the table there was a decanter con- taining wine.              s He filled a glass and drank its Jontents at a draught. Then resumed his seat.        in But he had not been very long in the w e easy chair before he began to feel singu- larly drowsy. Not wishing to sleep, he rose and walk- an ed again.               a  I But he was awfully sleepy.      he: To keep awake, he took one more glass.                 wh He  could not possibly keep his eyes tui open any longer.             I   "Its strange, too," he muttered. "I Ie" am not generally this way. I thought I ;h. could have sat up any length of time. I or have played cards two nights and a day all of a stretch when it has been worth my te while, and I was not very tired either; but to.-night-" a- He yawned and turned in his chair. ly I After all, why should he not take a nap i All at once he began to cough, and started to his feet. v-  The room was full of smoke. be He ran to the door, but found it was locked. This, then, had been the noise that he had heard. He was locked in. 6y By whom? d  His wife. Under ordinary circumstances it would have been easy enough to force r- one of the doors open, but a strange weakness had come ovor him. f He could not battle with the lethargy which seemed to hold himn captive. Y  The smoke was now rapidly filling the room, coming, as it seemed to him, f from under one of his doors. L The house was on fire. The staircase in a blaze. Staggering weakly across the room he approached one of the windows. It was fastened with the usual bar and catch, easy enough to undo, but his ; fingers refused to do their office. Vainly he strove to press the spring, but a  baby's hand would have been of as much service. Again and again he tried, but with the same effect. Then yelled for help. He staggered back towards the door, But now his strength seemed utterly to fail him. His brain was in a whirl. With a deep groan, he fell heavily to the ground.            J At this moment loud and piercing shrieks rent the air- "Fire!  Fire!" The servants were screaming shrilly in their bedrooms above, for the stairs were one raging furnace. When Clara left the house she hurried away in a westerly direction, and, hiring a  hack, drove as it seemed in pursuit of her husband. She came in due course to the villa where Briggs was awaiting Madge's re- turn. Here, in front of the house, having  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6980-00000041"/> sent away the vehicle, she waited pa- tiently until he came out again. Then she followed him. She saw him go in, and waited once more, with the same patience, for him again to make his appearance. As he did not come, however, she took from her pocket a small. latch key, and quietly entered the house. Then stole on tiptoe upstairs. In atmost a quarter of an hour she again descended to the street. Then stole stealthily away. It was now broad daylight, but the streets were still and deserted. No one was about, and no one noticed the bright glare within the house, until the piercing shrieks of the servants were heard rending the still morning air. Caring very little what might be their fate, Clara hurried away. Before the police station she stopped her hack and alighted. The officer taking the night charges raised his eyes as she entered, seemed to recognize her, and bowed. "I told you," she said, " that I would come unexpectedly."        j "Is it time, ma'am?" "Yes."              V "When will you be ready, ma'am?" "This moment. Have you any men a here fit for the business?"    t "It will not take very long, ma'am. a Not many minutes, although we cer- tainly did expect a longer notice." 1 "I told you that the notice would be short. It could not be otherwise. I i have been anxiously waiting for it my- c self for the last fortnight."   t "And now you can put us on to the gang!" "I can take you to the place where s you will find them all."      e "Are there many T"       a "A dozen." The officer looked very grave at c this.  "We must use great caution," he said.               3 "Every caution is necessary."  g "And you think that you can put us n onto the right scentt" "I am sure I can." ' If we could only have reconnoitred a the premises previously."     b "And ruined the whole business." p "IHow sot"  "By letting them know that some treachery was afloat. No. Rely on me, i and all will be right. This is the only   I llUJ U K. - time when you would have any chance." "How so?" "This is the time when you will find: them in their first sleep after their orgies are concluded. At any other time it would require at least three times their number to do anything with them." The officer reflected for a few mo- ments. Then he called one of his subordi- , nates and despatched him with a mes- sage. In less than five minutes appeared a party of sixteen policemen, all in pri- vate clothes and armed with pistols and clubs. Clara meanwhile had asked to retire to an inner room, and emerged in a few moments wearing a suit of male attire, which became her admirably. The party started, Clara leading the way. CHAPTER XXITI. IT was between four and five o'clock when Clara and the police arrived in front of the old house. She was evidently well acquainted with all its details. She caused the hacks to be stopped at a distance of fifty or sixty yards from the gate, and directed the men to divide and approach in separate parties. All was dark and silent within the house. "This is the only time," said Clara, in a low voice, to one who had command of the party, " that we could have hoped to surprise them." "How shall we now proceed?" "You had all better put on your list slippers now. Close to this spot is the entrance to the subterranean passage, and we will all descend together." "I I am afraid that even with all our care we may be overheard. There are so many of us." "If we are overheard we are lost. The passages through which we are going to pass can be flooded at a mo- ment's notice." "Flooded?" "Yes. Do you see that dyke? It is a sort of cistern. A ring can be pulled by any of the band. The exits of the passages are instantly closed, and the water pourt in through the roof." "Good heavens! It is like walking into a trap.' "There is no other way, though."   "It would not be a good plan, do you think, for half the party to remain out- side!" "What for?"-        - "To keep guard." *' Out of danger, eh?" "mOut of dange r 1 No. Whatdo you mean?" "Would you take command of that part, and shall I go with the other?" "I'm not afraid to go, if you mean that. Only I don't want the vagabonds to escape, thlat's all." "Ah, to be sure, I didnotlook at it in that light. However, they won't es- capo if we mind what we are about." "I hope not." "Leave it to me, and I'll take care of you. You see there are twelve of them and only sixteen of you, and they're roguish  customers and won't allow themselvesafbe collared and pulled along by the ear like a lot of boy pick- pockets," Clara's tone was very insulting, and the officer was rather jealous of her au- thority. He had distinguished himself many 1 times by his sagacity and bravery, and he did not relish being led to glory by a petticoat, even though that petticoat I was now disguised in male attire.  c It would not do to quarrel with the guide just now, at any rate, for they t did not yet know the entrance to the fl cavern. It was concealed in an artful way by bushes and briars.          M Clara pulled these on one side and h touched a secret spring. Obedient to her presssure, a large w moss-grown stone revolved slowly. A  flight of stone steps was then dis- ki closed to view, down  which, followed in by the ment she cautiously descended. ol They arrived at the bottom  of the st steps at the entrance to a passage. It was long and low, and narrow, and ot very dark. They crept on in silence.     bu It was pitch dark. "If we only had a lantern," he said. wm "The first glimmer  of it would be shi fatal."               bl "I hope we're all right," thought the kn officer. Then a little further on he asked: by n"Haven't we nearly reached the jour- cai ney's end"   . "Very nearly.  Nowfor it "    gr As she thus answered, in a low whis- I   'ou per, Clara touched a spring and a door ut- opened in front of them. Through the aperture was to be ob. tained a full view of a largedimlvl-#ght- ed apartment. Upon 'velvet couches around the on stalwart forms of the coiners were stretched. tat They were apparently unarmed, but close at hand were to be seen pistols an andswords ready for use at a moment's Tds notice. "Now, single your men, and make a it simultaneous rush."  These were the instructions which Clara gave They all prepared themselves. of  Each singled out his man. m  The officer gave the signal, and they re stole into the room. v  When within a yard or two  of their d men one who was not asleep sprang up z- with a loud cry. In an instant the rest were on their d feet. l- They- stood for a moment staring wildly at their enemies, then seized F their arms. 1 A fearful conflict now ensued. - While they were thus engaged Clara thad stolen back into the passage and closed the door. Turning in an opposite direction to that in which she had come, she in a 3few seconds reached the door of the store-room. Here she knew the wealth of the gang was kept, and to this she intended to help herself. But at the door she came face-to-face with an old woman. She acted as cook, and that night was keeping watch over her master's gold in the absence of its ordinary guard, the old man whom Clara had killed when she rescuedDumar. Without a word she. sprang at the other's throat. The old woman struggled violently, but ineffectually, to free herself. The other pressed her down, and wrenching violently at a neckerchief she wore, held her helpless, until the black and swollen veins rose up like knotted cords on her forehead. The first blow is half the victory, and by the suddenness of her attack she had carried the day. The old woman's struggles  grew gradually fainter. At length she lay perfectly still.  &#xD;<pb n="80 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6980-00000042"/> Then Clara rose, and, opening the door, listened. The sound of the clashing of swords, and the hoarse cries of the combatants met her cars. She gazed round the room. "There is plenty of time," she mut- tered to herself. "While they are fighting I can get clear off." She approached a small wooden box as she spoke. It was locked. On the old woman's neck, however, was a cord, to which a key was at- tached. Clara took it off and inserted it in the lock. It turned easily. Next moment she was on her knees before the gold, cramming it into her pockets with both hands. But, while she was so engaged, of a sudden there was a terrific explosion. A fearful thundering crashing sound. Huge beams of wood sprang from their places, and flew like chips, and the walls came tumbling down on all sides, like the walls of a house built of cards. For a few moments she lay crouching before the box in trembling terror, half covered with the ruins, her hands clasped over her eyes, striving as it seemed to shut out from her sight the hideous death which every instant threatened her. But after a couple of minutes had thus passed she opened her eyes and, raising them, saw that the roof had been blown off by the explosion, and that only the bright blue sky was over her. Around, all was ruin and desolation. She rose tottering to her feet, and began to crawl out from the rubbish which surrounded her. But scarcely had she moved, scarcely had she had time to be quite certain that her life was safe, when her thoughts reverted to the gold. She stooped down again, and busied herself with the box. But the lid defied all her efforts to raise it. A filling beam had jammed it down tightly. She wrenched and tugged at it in vain. The box was jammed as tightly among the mass of fallcu brick and stonle sur- rounding and half covering it as though it formed a portion of fi solid, rock.   No, she must abandon her prize after all. Rising, therefore (who can say how reluctantly?), she crawled out of the ruins and crept away, fearful lest she might be seen and questioned respect- ing what had taken place At the stillest hour of the night let us now take the reader to some other ruins. Here two ghostly shadows flitting to and fro search for a secret subterra. nean passage. One of them is Clara. The other is Dumar. This time she is more successful. With her companion's aid she effects an entrance into the secret passage. Pursuing the way which Clara and her victim Madge had followed when going upon the fatal journey from which the latter never returned, they came at last to the door of the cell where the hideous crime had been per. petrated. CHAPTER XXIV. When Rose Seymour awoke upon the following morning she reflected a while upon the many startling incidents which had concluded the  eventful yesterday. She sprang from her couch in a state of fright, and looked anxiously about her. The terrible words which the old man and his younger, but no more scru- pulous, companion had spoken now began to fill her with renewed alarm. Upon the preceding day the stirring events which had brought her into con. tact with them had so completely riveted her attention that she could not give their speeches full importance. She looked about her anxiously. The door, she could see at a glance, was fast closed. However, some mleans of escaping from this alarming thraldom must cer tainly present itself, if she kept contin ually upon the look-out. She now became aware of one start ling fiact. Her clothes had been removed! Their place, however, had been sup. plied by a complete suit of nmale attire. T'is, then, was the explanation oi some portion or' the drama in which she was called upon to play.   TIIE DUEL IN THE WOODS.  &#xD;<pb n="-81" xml:id="VAC6980-00000043"/> She examined the clothes attentively, and found them to be perfectly new, and of elegant material and make. For an instant she contemplated ar- raying herself in these garments. But presently thed thought flashed across her mind that she might be un- willingly ab)etting a foul conspiracy, and she determined to resist this pre- liminary step. But how to act? This was a most difficult question to answer. However, she was spared much trou- ble upon this head, for within half an hour she heard footsteps pause by her chamber door. With one bound she was at the door, grasping the handle with both her hands. There was a rap upon the door. "Are you waking yet?" It was the voice of the younger man. While she was meditating the advis- ability of replying, the young man grew impatient, and repeated his ques- tion. "Rose Seymour," he called, rather louder than before, " are you awake yet?" "Yes." "Are you ready to depart a" "Where?" "You answer my question by putting mother. Answer me." "I cannot say if I am ready to de- part, unless I am acquainted with the destination." - "That cannot affect you in any way whatever, Rose Seymour." "Then I refuse compliance." "You cannot!" "Cannot?" repeated Rose, indignant- ly, "I do." "Foolish girl!" "And I warn you that unless my clothes are immediately restored to me, and I am allowed to depart, I shall, at she very earliest opportunity, represent my treatment at your hands to the nearest magistrate.'" After this desperate speech, which had called for all Rose's courage to I utter it, shed paused in silence to wait  his reply.             ( None came. Then her defiance had not been without effect.      a Another instant, however, and this  pleasant illusion waas most effectually f dispelled. She heard  a key placed in  the i lock!                1   It was ttYnedA, and the sound struck r, terror to her heart. "You hear that?" demanded the - man from without. 'I do," faltered Rose. "I pray d yon-" "Fear nothing. No harm is intended , you; but I would have you understand - how useless it is for you to attempt to resist us." "By what authority?" began poor - o Rose, in indignation. "-Pah!" said the man. "Oblige me - by using such despatch as possible. a Time presses." r  And then, upon Rose Seymour still denying his authority, the door was , partially opened. r  Rose gave a faint shriek. "You see," said the man, " that we are willing-nay, anxious-to treat you with every consideration and forbear- ance; but you must obey us. I think now that you will do as we request." L  Rose was humbled. "What do you wish?" she demanded in faltering accents. "Dress yourself." "But my clothing is gone." "In the things you have, then." "At least let me know the purpose for this strange disguise." "No-enough for you that you have a mission to fulfill which you must and shall -carry out. Don't attempt to thwart us, for you see how you, will fail, and the consequences of the at- tempt must recoil upon you with disas- trous effect." Further resistance was useless. And now that Rose had no other al- ternative she hastily arrayed herself in the suit of male clothing. The alacrity with which she uow obeyed the request-or rather command -of the man procured her much more consideration than before, and he wait- ed patiently without, until she an- nounced that she was ready. Then he entered.  A glance at his costuLme showed her that he was attired for travell-l g-a-- circumstance which she mentally noted, as she wondered if it had anything to do with her own disposal. For a, iniuute o r inte to he surveyed her attentively, in a way that brought, the crimson blood with 1 rush into her -flir face.

"' It is really marvellous!" he exclaim- ed. "You will do capitally; but you must not move about with those mlin- cing little steps now, or you will be dis- covered at once." "By whom?" "'No matter for that-by any one who chancesto see you--any one that we do not wish should discover you." "Butallst, at lestell me the reason I should fear discovery." "Not a word." This was all he would utter, and Rose was forced to rest contented. Arrived below, he led her into an apartment in which a meal of the most sumptuous description was prepared. Here he handed her to a chair. with a politeness which seemed to come but ill from one who had observed such a singular behavior towards her before. "Eat," he said. "Take as much refresh- ment as you encn now, for we are about to start upon a long, journey." ios e did not even now contemplate discussing the authority by which he uttered-hlt is commands. While she was partaking of the rich viands before her the old man returned. He greeted lur lll rtoine -with a grave inclination of the head, and then turned to the young man. "Good morning, Maurice," he said, in the gruff tone whch had so startled Rose upon the previous day. "Good day sir." "Are you ready?" "Not quite," said the other, glancing at their guest. Rose caught the look, and at once moved from the table. "Do not disturb yourself," said the old man. "Maurice will wait for you. You understand" The latter words were addressed to the young man, who bowed in reply. "Oh, I am quite prepared," said leosc. "Nay, but yont1 ]rd better breakfast well ere we depart," said Maurice. "SVc s' th llot alke;t :a stage for soume lillme vet ." The old mat now mentioned to the last spelClker to leave the room.

"Your name is henceforth Jesse Dumar," he began. "Jesse Dumar?" "Ay." "But-" "Pardon me," said the old man. "In order to lose no time at present, oblige me by listening with attention to what I have to say, without interruption. I told you yesterday that you had to play a part in a comedy of real life." "You did, sir." "Then remember. Explanations for the present are impossible. But bearin mind. as your startingpoint, that you answer only to the name of Jesse Dumar." "Very well, sir." "The part we now call upon you to play touches upon a most critical business for myself and Maurice. Follow out our instructions implicitly. Have what con- fidence in us you may-" "Confidence?" interrupted Rose. "Oh! that is itmpossible!" "Perhaps.  But no matter. Under any circumstances you must obey us to tlhe letter, and all will be wrell. You will achieve a bIrilliant position, be courtedl and feted in society, and have incalculablel wealth at your conlmmand." tosc was p1erfiectly dumbfounded. "But sur1ely, sir," she said, "there must be some cxplanation in this." "* Anon." "'And is it plossible for me to play such a part as that to which you allude in utter ignorance of its object." "Perfectly." "But, sir, I entreat you, if possible, to give me some explanation, and rely on my discretion." "Presently, I tell you," replied the ^ old man. "For the present you must j be satisfied that whatever you may have to do with us now can only result in  your own social advancement. Any other girl would have jumpled at such  an offer as ours, believe me." "I do believe you," replied Rose, "and therefore I cannot imagine why you have forced your benefits upon me, who am so unwilling to serve my own advancement." "Unwilling, ay?  And that's the mystery to me, that you, whom we have rescued from such a precarious mode of existence, should have displayed so much obstinacy." "Not obstinacy, sir," said Rose. "If   I am so well treated by you and Mr.  Maurice, as you call the gentleman who has just left us, I can but be grateful for your kindness. I only object to work in the dark." "Tut, tut!" said the gentleman, im- patiently. "Let it suffice for you that this is necessary for us at present." AT this period of the conversation the young man again entered the room. Rose glanced up, and perceived that he held in his hands a hat and light overcoat. "The completion of my male dis- guise," she thought.       4 Her conjecture plrovedl to be cor- rect. "Will you put on these, Mr. Dumar?"  said Maurice. Rose looked at the old man, but did not offer to move. "Did you not hear Maurice?" said t the latter to Rose. "I? Oh yes. Did you address me?" "Yes," said Maurice. "I addressed t Jesse Dumar. You are Jesse Dumar  from this day forth, remember." s Rose was so staLtlel by their manner, d and so thoroughly ovceraweld, thlat with- out a word she tookl the hat and coat s from his hands and put them on. /lotlI of the men stared at her, as if fc wonder-stricken at her appearance. "Is it not wonderful?" exclaimed the te old ma11n i a subdued voice, as if hohad seen a lphantom. "Marve llowus!          r Rose glthcede from one face to the othe for some explanation of the mys- terious words .d But not the faintest notion could she w gain of their meanling. "Come," said the old man. "But before wC deDlarlt I mllay as well infor fre you1, in order to avoid anlly unplleasant W embllarrasshmllnt later, that my name is Wharton.

Rose looked about for Mr. Dumar be- f fore she remembered herself. She had not become quite reconciled to her new appellation. "I should indeed, Mr. Wharton," she replied, " if convenient." "Of course, if you wish it." "Thank you." Mr. Wharton tapped at the front win. dow, and his son jumped from the box, and came to the carriage door.  "Did you want me, sir?" "Mr. Dumar wishes to rest until the fresh horses are put to," replied Mr. Wharton. The young man held his arm for Rose to descend, and then, drawing her arm through his, they strolled into the inn . "What can I get you, Jesse?" asked the young man. "Nothing thL thank you," replied Rose. "I only wish to rinse my hands before proceeding. The day is so hot, and I s   stl^ing-.

"Yes, sir."  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6980-00000045"/> The waiter led the way, and conduct- ^ ed Rose into a room adjoining. Here she was provided with the re- quisites for her hasty toilet, and left to herself. This was more than she expected. She did not even dare to hope, from the vigilance previously exercised, in her care by her self-elected guardians, that they would leave her for a moment unwatched. No sooner was she alone than she be- gan to reflect upon her singular posi- tion. Not only to reflect upon it, but to cogitate the chances and benefits of flight. Up to the present her acquaintance with Mr. Wharton and his son had only resulted in benefit to herself. But this should have no weight with her if there were the slightest chance of eluding them. Something dreadful she anticipated must be the destined sequel of the pres- ent luxury. Therefore she wo ld fly. But how? Chance had placed the means at her comman d. The apartment in which she now found herself opened by two lattice windows into a little bower or summer- house. This led into a garden. In an instant she had removed the window fastenings and stepped forth. Violently she trembled now, as if she were about to commit some deed of des- peration. The garden was gained without noise, and Rose trod lightly across the beds and arrived at the gate. It was the only opening in the hedge at that part of the ground. The g-ate was fastened and the only way to surmount this obstacle to her pro- gress was to climb it. This was scarcely resolvred upon ere it was accomplished. And now she stood there-free! She hlad quitted the house by the bac1k, auld nothing remained but to fol- low straiglht on the path to whllicll she wans bearing. It was narrow laine, edtged( upon either bide 5. o. si-ecp embankment. And now commenced her flighllt. But, alas! a cruel tlis:ll"poilll nent was ill store for hler.

So, eo!" 11e said severely, " this is the way you would repay the confidence I repose in you. Henceforth you have made your life less pleasant. Jesse Du- mar, you may now consider yourself indeed a prisoner." CHAPTER XXV. POOIt Rose n-)w allowed herself to be led back to the carriage without a mur- mur. Fate was against her. Fora while they heaped reproaches upon her head, to which she did not offer the slightest excuse or reply. And now the journey was once more resumed. For the remainder of the day they travelled incessantly. Not a word was exchanged between them. Night came on, and they put up at an inn till the morning. Rose did not here venture to repeat her attempt to escape. Mr. Wharton occupied a chamber ad- joining hers, and Maurice Wharton slept below. At sunrise Mr. Whartdn was stirring and at Rose's chamber door. "Mr. Dumar," he called, after tapping at the door, " are you ready?" "Immediately, sir," said our heroine, awake on the instant. "Take your time. We will wait for you below." Then she hurriedly prepared herself for another day of adventure, wonder- ing what was to be the next step in her eventful career. Towards evening they began to pass through a rough country, the inhabit- 3 ants of which appeared to Rose to bo half savages. Grim, weird-looking women, and dark visaged men, with dirt-begrimed flesh and bristling beards, and with big, brawny bare arms, they encountered at every step. Ir It was here that Mr. Wharlton broke a terriole silence which had lasted over two hours. 8  And much to Rlose's relief. "Whre re e you ta'king me to V" asked (d our heroine in alalu.   "You are alarmed at these people.?" "I am." "These people all have that wild ap- pearance, from the nature of their em- ployment. They pass three-fourths of their time away from the light of day, and it is no wonder that they should be different from other men." "They are indeed different." "But they are perfectly harmless," said Mr. Wharton, observing the look of fear upon Rose's countenance. "Possibly; but their appearance is enough to frighten one." "Ah!" said Mr. Wharton. "You will very soon get used to them. I know I most of them for miles about, and should not fear to encounter any of them alone  and unarmed at any hour." Rose was silent now.  She was brooding over his words-  "You will very soon getused to-them.'" Less than half an hour's drive through the district brought them to a gentle- man's country seat-a handsome dwel- ling, richly appointed, and situated in i the centre of a vast park.     u To Rose's surprise the carriage drove up to the principal entrance, and Mr. r Wharton dismounted.         a "Come, Mr. Dumar," said he, hand- ing out our heroine, "this is our des- r tination, reached at last."     8( Rose descended, and w4as ushered into the house by a servant in plain clothes, b who was humble and obsequious to a n degree. What now puzzled her more and more m was that all about her appeared to have anticipated her arrival!       sa The servants, one and all, addressed hl her as Mr. Dumar when they had occa- of sion to mention her name. At other times it would appear that p] her sex was quite forgotten, for she was always addressed as " sir."     co One of the men, who was rather more loquacious than his fellows, ventured ea to hope that Mr. Dumar was perfectly recovered, adding that, from the latest by accounts received of him from  Mr. Wharton, they had greatly feared that an he (Rose) would not have been able to diE reappear at the Willows so soon. Rose saw at once that this was part ofu the comedy which she was destined to play.               aS Understanding this, therefore, she wl very wisely refrained from saying ought in answer winch she deemed might i compromise her.            di   At the very earliest moment she de- termined to seek an explanation from *- Mr. Wharton, for now she had a fair t- excuse to offer. )f The following day she began to grow , more enlightened upon the point, before e she had the opportunity of questioning Mr. Wharton as she desired. The old housekeeper--Mrs. Grundy "--came to pay her a visit of ceremony 1 and offer congratulations. This proved exceedingly embarrass- ing for our heroine. However she endeavored to fence i with the questions put to her, she could r scarcely avoid-betraying herself.  "I hope that you have perfectly re- covered now, sir," began the old dame. Rose saw that she was supposed to have been unwell, and she replied as- cordingly. '  Ah, sir!" said the housekeeper, "we had sad accounts of you." "Indeed?" "Yes, sir," she continued, " and very much indeed we feared that you were unsettled severely."  She tapped her forehead most myste- riously as she spoke, and at once threw a light upon the subject. She was supposed to be insane-or, rather, to have recently recovered her senses. She got over this most unpleasant business as easily as possible, and dis- missed the old dame. She longed to be alone now  to com- mune with her own thoughts. As soon as she accomplished this, and sat herself down to think over all that had occurred, it came to her liblo a flash of lightning. She was supposed to be the heir to the property about, who had lost his twits. But if this was the case, what had be- come of the actual owner? This was a question which Has not so easily settled. Had he been removed from the place by fair means or foul? No matter; she was so far enlightened, and she resolved to communicate her, discovery to Mr. Wharton. That gentleman listened to her with- out betraying the least surprise. "  You are perfectly correct in your surmise,-"he said coolly. "And now what do you say?" Rose could say nothing. She was so utterly bewildered by the discovery that for some time she could  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6980-00000046"/> not resolve upon what line of conduct to continue. She felt an unconquerable repugnance to the duties she was now called upon to fulfil, but she deemed it prudent to disguise this from Mr. Wharton and Maurice, his son. Did either of them suspect she well knew that a strict watch would be set upon her actions? She1 therefore resolved to appear only tile better pleased at her remarkable position, and quietly await the moment to make a second attempt to release herself from the painful thraldom which was exercised. Two days passed, after her conver- sation with Mr. Wharton, without an opportunity presenting itself. At length the moment for action ar- rived. MaIurice Wharton had left the house upon a visit to a friend who resided some few miles distant. The old man retired early to rest, and all the house followed his example. Rose determined to take advantage of these circumstances, and therefore very quietly dressed herself, and crept from her chamber. 'The fastenings of the doors were very easily removed, for in that rural district no fears of robbers alarmed  the peaceable inhabitants. She was friendless, penniless, it was true; but she was escaping from an act of treachery and baseness which she had unwillingly abetted, and IHeaven would lend its protection to the innocent. With a silent prayer for aid in this hour of trial, Rose Seymour left the house, and walked boldly out into the night. CH-IAPTER XXVI. lRose had barely started upon her flight whcn it occurred to her that it would beo an easy task for her two captors to trace her by a description of her apparel. She must seek a change of dress, and resume if possible the natural costume of her sex, and then her flight could be mlore easily effected. Now that she was returned to the house, however, she found it no easy matter to attain her object. She possessed no femihine garments, and had not the least idea where to pro- cure them.   In her rambles over the house she had noted the bedchambers of the maids, and had more than once contemplated resorting to one of them for assistance, should it ever become necessary. The occupant of the bedchamnber was sleeping heavily, and by her loud breath- ing assured the fugitive that she had no interruption to fearfrom that quarter. Upon a chair beside the bed lay the sleeper's clothes-a whole attire com- plete! Rose never paused to consider if the appropriation of these could be regarded in the light of a robbery, but immedi- ately took them. However, the difficulties were not over, even now thlat she had found the necessary garments to equip her for her adventure. She had to effect her toilette. This room, too, was garnished with those endless little aids to the feminine toilet which was lacking in her own masculine apartment. The thought, the resolve and its exe- cution were almost simultaneous, and Rose rapidly divested herself of her male attire and donned the petticoats. In throwing tho dress over her head she did not observe the necessary cau- tion, under the peculiar circumstances, and had the misfortune to catch it in the chair from which she had removed it. Over it went with a loud crash, and up1 started the sleeping chambermaid, fully awake in an instant. "Who's there?" Rose was now in a dilemma! True, she was in the dark. The only bit of light which the dark, moonless night afforded was admitted through a small aperture in the window curtain, and fortunately did not touch her side of the room. "Any one there?" The fears of the startled chamber- maid were by no means assuaged by the silence, and her voice trembled in a painful way. But Rose was so occupied with her own perilous position that she could not afford a thought for the troubles of the chambermaid. "Is there any one in the room?" again said the girl. And then, upon the painful silence still continuing, she slipped from the bed and walked to the door. "' Great Heavens!" mentally ejacula-   ted our heroine, '- she is going to alarm the house. Oh! whatever will become of me?" Happily she was mistaken. The frightened maiden had no more violent intention than to turn the key in the lock to secure herself from intru- sion. However, in her haste, and the tremb- ling grasp she had of the key, she could not withdraw her hold in safety. Out came the key and fell to the floor. In an instant the whole force of this mishap flashed upon her. She was locked in the room, and thekey was lost! But then she watched patiently, lis- tening for the signal of the servant- maid's renewed slumbers. A   long, long weary time it was, for the girl had been so thoroughly startled that she a determined to keep awake until morn- ing.                s Fortunately foi Rose, exhausted  u nature put in a superior claim to her de- termination, and  the  chambermaid r once more slept. Now began a  search upon the floor, which was commenced with very little hopes of sueces. The girl herself had spent twenty good minutes in the hunt after the iey before she had given it up lu in despair, determining (she had mur- mured it aloud, and therefore Rose ap- preciated the difficulty) to wait until eC daylight.             he Our heroine had great venture at stake and was not to bo put off with a, few cl fre barrassments. With a  patience worthy of emulation she pursued her hopeless of search.              wl At length  even Rose's courage was he s exhausted. Sho rose from her reclining 1 position, stifiened in the back-and, orY wonderful chance!-her foot touched   ' the identical object upon   the floor ca which had been the cause of so much of. patient search and trouble.     I Its transition from the floor to the flig lock was the work of  an instant.   S Thelock was turned, and she stood stol in  theo passage.         the Still, a little difficulty remained.

The alarm bell of the mansion was rilging violently! CHAPTER XXVII. FOR an  instant Rose paused irreso. lute, holding her breath. Her heart stood still. A renewed pealing of the bell, how- ever, more loudly than before, brought her to her senses. With a start, she hurried on like a friglteled deer. Presellntly she arrived at a smallpiece of water, wild and picturesque, Ibut whose beauty had no charm for her in her present critical position. aowever, it served to jog her llem- ory upon an important point. The suit of clothes which she yet carried with her had to be disposed Yes. Thus would all traces of her flight be destroyed. She hastily gathered up some heavy stones and put them in the pockets of the coat and trowsers. T  hen , with a h andkerchief,  she fas- tened them together, and cast them into the w ater. The stones which she put into the hat unfortunately fell out as she threw it from her, and the hat floated! This was a misfortune not to be remle- died she deemed. Future events, however, will show  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6980-00000047"/> whether this could really be regarded in such a light. No time now remained to attend to so trifling an occurrence, and once more blhe hurried onwards. The pool was not quite passed, when Rose, to her dismay, caught the sounds of voices at no great distance, shouting apparently to some one following. It needed no very quick ear to detect the well-remelmbered tones of Maurice Wharton. "Come on," he cried, now quite close at land. "This is the direction I am surec. He could never have got round the road." Rose was now in sad trouble. Her pursuers were certainly more fleet of foot than herself. Added to this, her movements were greatly impeded by the ill-fitting dress which she abstracted from the bedroom of the chambermaid. She began to regret that she had paused to change her garments. Had she hurried on when first she left the house, she would hare been safe from all danger of recapture lnow. Moreover, the other apparel was far morbe favorable for her hurried move- ments. Tilllme pressed. In a minute more they wouldl be by the pool. Fear seemedl to palIalyse her movements now that she had thie greatest need of cour- age and  support. She could not  A bush only screened her fi'om the view of any one at the further side of the pool. Maurice Wharton now appeared run- ning up in a very excited state. Then he paused and turned to call impatient- ly to Mr. Wharton, whose older limbs could not keep pace with the fire and energy of his son. "Come, come, father," cried Maurice, "Fishe has passed by here--I am sure of it." "I know it," cried Mr. Wharton, in answer from a short distance in the rear. "I can see traces of her progress yet." "Yes, yes--and see here are marks- foot-prints upon the banks of the pool." Rose trembled violently. "Hurry on, then, boy," cried Mr. Wharton. "'Wait not for me. On, on w' But Maurice Wharton, instead of obeying his father's injunction, only gave a cry of mingled alarm and amaze- ment. "Great Heavens!"   "What now?" cried Mr. Wharton, just arriving upon the scene. "See," cried the young man, ploint- ing to the centre of the pool. Rose could not see, but she divined what was the object of the speech. That unfortunate hat! "A hat'!" "Whose?" "Hers. Rose's, doubtless." "Well, then, she has passed here- eh?" "Nay, I think not." "What do you mean?" "I mean," said Maurice Wharton, in a still, solemn tone of voice, " that Rose Seymour has been driven to self-de- struction!" The subject of his speech turned all over in a cold perspiration. The idea of having slain herself was terrible to hear. "What, do you mean to say that she has committed suicide?" demantde Mr. Wharton "I do." "How shocking!" Mr. Wharton said "How shocking I' as if he had just learnt that his servant had robbed him, or that a favorite dog had been hurt or his hunter lamed. "Here is the place, too, from which she has jumped doubtless," said Miaurice Wharton. "Do you see the foot- prints?" "Ah, yes," said his father. "But, dear me, this will be disagreeable." "It will indeed." "Yes, the pool will be dragged, and then there will be a post-mortem exami- nation." "No, no, that can be avoided." "How?" "I shall take means to destroy these traces which have told us this much. No one will ever know of this night's work." "But the hat?" "Can easily be sunk or recovered." "So be it," said Mr. Wharton. "It is a thousand pities, though. This girl served our purpose so well. And she was fbolishy blind to her own interests." "True," rejoined Maurice Wharton. "For a time at least she would have enjoyed all Jesse's magnificence." "Ay," said his father. "'And wha ' matter how soon, or in what mannel her existence terminated?" Rose trembled so dreadfully at these words that she feared she should betray   JLiLJ k.3J IJ herself. They indicated a clear under- standing as to her ultimate disposal! "Itis all the more annoying," ex- claimed Mr. Wharton pettishly, as if he had lost a shirt I button or missed an ex- press train, "that Jesse must now be looked after." "True." "Had it been otherwise, he might havte been permitted to live on with Clara., "Possibly," said Maurice Wharton. "but you mknow that WAs always dead against my ideas." "Yes, yes," said Mr. Wharton. "Young blood is ever too hot we know." "And old too tardy." This angry retort appeared for a moment likely to provoke a quarrel be- tween this precious father and son. However, the guilty tie between them was too strong to allow any matter of personal consideration to stand in their way. "Yes, yes," muttered Mr. Wharton rather as a soliloquy than as if address- ing his son. "Jesse must be removed. Had that girl stayed until she could have been disposed of in a legal and me- dicinal manner it might have been otherwise. Confound it! And I am  anxious to spare the boy, too. Had  always an inclination for him. I loved  his father! Well, well, I suppose that  it is not now to be helped." And Mr. Wharton walked moodily  1 from the spot, muttering aloud as he 1 went.   - "What a fearful man is this!" thought t Rose, who was shivering with fright in 1, her hiding-place . "He talk of assas- c sination as an every-day occurrence." Maiurice Wharton remained behind for several minutes, much to Rose's alarm. He  was apparently amusing i himself by throwing stones into the Vwatc. A curious pastime, thought  c our heroine, for such a nature, and to n be carried on at such an unearthly hour. I But presently he ceased, and left the nr spo w   uith an xclamation of satisfac- tion. Rose  comprehended his amusement  VS now. He had been tossing stones on- to the floating hat until he had succeed- ed in sinking it. And now that all danger of imme- diate pursuit was over Rose Seymour ba was in no trifling consternation.  She had become so interwoven in the p terrible chain of guilt which these two ha   er- 'tMurserous Whartons were coiling aroundthem that she felt almost as iL :- she had participated in their crimes. he Certain it was that she had become the x- unwilling instrument of another's un- be doing. Jesse Dumar, the heir to the vast estate and wealth, and whom she had been impersonating at the com- mands of the  two Whartons, was h doomed to a violent death because she had fled! But she had fled to avoid doing fur- ys ther injustice to the man she was im- personating. She saw, too, that she n. had narrowly escaped herself from the "remorseless clutches of these terrible men.  Their purpose once achieved a she would have fallen a victim to their B- devices-alone, unaided, and uncared i. for. " With a shudder Rose Seymour turned f from the pool and fled. r On, on she pushed, praying for some dwelling where she could throw herself , upon tihe mercy of the inlhabitants. - . At lengthl she perceived a faint light in the distance. The sight of this in- ] spired her anew with hope, and she - hurried onwards. L The light which Rose had observed in i the distance she now perceived pro- i ceeded firom one of the quaLSrrymen's 1 cottages, and up to it she went for shel- ; ter for tlheo remainder of the night. A while she paused before the door irreso- lute. Then she gave a low, tiliorous , knockl, which passed unheeded. No other result attended a second and a third summonlls. And thenll she rapped louder.  "Hullo! Who's there?" ex- claimed a voice from within. "Who's there?" "A traveller," said Rose, faintly. "What does a traveller want knock- ing one up at this hour?" "I am very sorry," sid Rose, "I per- ceived that a light still burnt, and was not aware that you had retired to rest. I have wandered very far, or I should not have venturedc to knock." And with this she was about to re- sume her weary pilgrimage, when the voice demanded--, Is it a woman?" "Yes, weary and footsore." "Hold hard a bit then, I'll let you in." The next minute the door was un- barred, and a huge man of ferocious as- pect admitted her. The next instant poor Rose repented having taken this step. She now found  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6980-00000048"/> herself in a small chamber, surrounded by a dozen of the wildest looking men she had ever seen.  As she entered several of them rose and advanced towards her. One fellow especially at- tracted the wanderer's attention. He was of the same build as the man who had admitted her-perhaps still more forbidding in aspect. "A comely wench," said he, staring insolently atRose. "Don't be afear'ld, my gal, I'll look arter ye. Icere, Pen- ryth, tell ye what, I'll take her home with me." Rose was terrified. Bitterly did she now repent that she hlad asked for shelter here. Alone, and at the mercy of this horde of ruffians! CHAPTER XXVIII. As the man spoke these words, Pcn- ryth sprang up in a fury. "What do you mean, Miles Trunnion, by that?" he demanded. "( That I'll take the gal, Penryth, if she bothers you h]ere," replied the other. "Thl'llen she don't." ' Tlhen I'll take her, all the same." Thle man Penryth, whlo was, as far as Rose could judge, the owner of the mis- erable little cabin, dashed his brawny fist upon the table, with a blow which split it across, and overturned a, jug of ale. "No, Miles Trunnion!" lie cried, in great wrath. 'tCurse me if you do that!" "Genltly, gently," said the other, rising, also. 'Your big words don't frighten me." "Maybe." "Nothing don't.  Now, I tell you what, we'll put it to the gal lerself. If she likes to stay with you, well and good. If she likes to go with me, so mutch the better." "Never!" ' Iulhlo!" '1 Never, I say, by-- " 1"Not quite so fast. If the gal wants to go with me, then go she shall." Several of the quarrymen joined in lere. Tlley were of opinion that Rose should be consulted.  Already they looked upon her as their particular property, but were ready to give her a voice in the matter of her own disposal, in order to avoid an outhreak between the two brawny giants, Penryth and   Miles Trunnion. The former opposed this for some time, observing that, since the gal had chosen his house to come to, there she should stop. "Well, my gal," said Miles Trunnion. "and how do you think now?" Rose shrank away from him. "There, there. You see what she means for her answer," quoth Penryth. "Devil a bit!" retorted Miles Trun- nlou. "I only see that the gal is a bit skeared by our roguish ways. But don't ye be afeared, my gal," he con- tinued, turning to Rose, "I'm as tender as a kitten." O-hlo!" "You may laugh, Penryth. It's true though. I've got the bear's velvet paw for a gal. The claws is only out when I'm riled!" He looked meaningly at Penryth as he uttered these words.  The latter sprang forward, with the uplifted jug, and would have administered punish- menltat once, had not their companions interfered. "I say, Penryth," cried one. "' Drop that game, you know.  All about a welnch, too. Well, I'm dashedif it ain't awfll." "Yes, ye3," cried several. "Look here," resumed the furmer speaker. "Tell you what. Why don't you share tho gal?" Poor Rose was in no trifling conster- nation now. But she fancied that she yet perceived a loophole for escape. At any rate it would offer her one more chance to get free from them. The conversion of our heroine into a joint-stock property of the two men was at at once hailed by all with shouts of approval. "If I am to be asked," began Rose in a faint voice. "Oh of course. By all means," sa:d Miles Trunnion, who fancied that ]lm perceivedl in Rose's interruption a favorable omen for himself. '"Let the gal decide for herself. I ask nothing better." "Ay, ay." And this was carried by the wholoe mnob of ruffians, nerm. con. "Then say what you would rather do, my gal," said Miles Trunnion. "I'd sooner go," said Rose. "Ha-ha!" cried Trunnion, with a laugh of triumph over Penryth. "Then curse ye," cried the latter, in a perfect fury. "I Why d'ye come here! No. Hang me if you leave here to night."   JaUOK jE To this Miles Trunnion replied, and a violent altercation ensued. Blows would have very speedily followed had not the companions of the two dis- putants interfered. However, the ma- jority sided with Miles Trunnion. The gal, they said, had a right to make her own choice, and she had decided for him. Miles Trunnion rose to depart, and beckoned our heroine to follow him, whereupon Penryth sprang for- walrd, and seized the poor girl by the arm in a vice-like grasp. "Let go," cried Trunnion. "Never!" said Penryth. "Thega's mine, and I'll stick up for my rights against a dozen of you and your dirty "D'ye hear that, mates?" said Trun- nion, turning appealingly to the others. "Yes," said one. "Drop it, Penryth, or else we must interfere." "Hang you-do you threaten me?" roared the maddened Penryth. "Not I, for one," said Miles Trunnion. I never threaten any man. I act!" Saying which, he delivered Penryth I a violent blow in the face. The door  was thrown open, and Miles Tlunnion I with Rose was hurried out by the re- 1 mainder oftheo quarrymen.  As soon as m they were outside the cabin Rose darted past the man and rushed boldly on. "Hullo, there!" cried  Trunnion. "What's  that?   Come backl; dye hear?" Rose, however, only increased her v speed. Leaping a  hedge one would sl scarcely have deemed him capable of, P from his big burly figure, he alighted upon the ground just before helr- Then n befbre she could even utter a  cry he c( had clasped her in his arms. "  Help! help!" shrieked Rose. 'What's all this row about?" de- manded the quarryman.       le 1"Mercy, have mercy!"      sig "Lor' love ye, what's got ye?   I O 4lon't want to eat you, stoopid." ru The girl he suddenly found hung a ce lead weight on his arms.      da A   man appeared upon the scene. It was Penryth. Hestood there, with his two hands grasping a  huge stone, up- in lifted above the head of Miles Trun- en nion. Down went the stone upon the be head of the unlucky Trunnion, stretch- yo ing him lifeless upon the ground, with- out a  murmur.          ha, "Ah!" shrieked Rose.      cai Curse her!  she's seen it," cried the ] man, "and she'll sell me for blood Wil   Sd money; but never. Dead men tell no mw tales!" ad  He darted upon the ensanguined is- stone and seized it in his hands. ia- Now it was almost a certainty that he Rose would have been sacrificed to his r. vengeance also, had not the sound of For footsteps alarmed the murderer. He rt, turned and fled. In an instant there )w was a rush to the spot, and before Rose ir- could gain her feet she was surrounded he by a mob of women-old hags, ragged and dirty, and of the most wild and ferocious aspect. 's  "ISee, see. This is what she's danei," ts cried one old hag, pointing to the pros- ty trate body of the man. "And it is Miles Trunnion." "Then down with his murderess- s. slay her-tear her piecemeal." i, "I swear I did not do it," cried Rose, earnestly.  "Believe me." '"She lies," interrupted the old hag. How came she here else?" "Down with her, then." Rose shrieked  and implored their h pardon, but  they  were inexorable. r Thus had she by the death ofte man i but escaped one fate for an other crcely - less horrible. In an instant, and with s wild ciries and yells, they fell upo her. CHAPTER    XXTX. At dead of night Jesse Dumar and the woman calling herself Clara St. John I stood among the ruins of the house in Park Street. The woman led the way among the ruins, and presently came to a halt at a certain place. "This is it," she said. "Is what?" asked her companion. "Never mind at present. You will learn all in good time. I want your as- sistahce when I  ask for it, no;t with- out." Clara, stooping down among the ruins, cleared away the rubbish from a certain place, and said: "This is a door. Can we open it?" "  I will try." He in turn stooped down and exam- ined the place. "If I remove this fall- en brickwork I  don't think there will be much difficulty--that is, of course, if you have got the key. "It opens with a   spring when you have cleared the stuff lying upon it. I can manage the rest." Dumar now worked away with a  good Will, and by turns using the pick and 4  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6980-00000049"/> Ilis hands, cleared away all obstructions in a few minutes.          t When he had done Clara leaned for- a Nward, and pressed heavily upon a I spring which had been hidden from  y her companion, and protected from  i injury by a projecting iron ledge of 1 enormous strength. Thle door, respon- i sive to the pressure, opened slowly in- I wards.               1 Dumar kept guard, and the other proceeded silently down the passage. Passing through several doors, she. at length reached the vault. Then raised E her lantern, and gazed upon the terrible spectacle before her. A glittering corpse was there, bowed over the iron box. -( I should not have lent them to her so long," muttered the fiend, "unless I had known that the vault was air-tight - and that they were quite safe. Still there was a certain amount of risk, and I would not have run it, but revenge was so sweet, and I could not resist gratifying my deadly vengeance upon her." While thus she spoke Clara was busilv engaged in collecting together the glittering gems which had proved so fatal to the poor wretch who had coveted them. She found Dumar leaning against the wall of the passage. She turned the lantern full upon his face. "Hullo!" said he, yawning and "0r you asleep!"       1 "Pretty nearly." "You call that keeping watch, I sup- pose?" "I kept it as long as I could, but you were such a deuce of a while. I began to think that you were buried alive." A strange smile passed over Clara's face, a terrible smile, full of terrible meaning.  "No," she said.  "Not yet." Then, after a pause of anloment, she added-"Come along. We have no time to waste. We must be going." He followed her without a word, and she closed the door after him, A ship, an emigrant vessel, a week after these events was on herway across the Atlantic. It was night. The greater part of the crew and passengers were asleep. Two among the latter, how- ever, might have been seen walking to- gether, and engaged in close conversa- tion. One was a lady, the other a gen- tleman.   "Yes, Jesse," the lady said, "the time will soon arrive when I shall be able to reveal to you all the mystery of my life. I will have no secrets from you, for our lives are henceforth bound up one with another. I am rich, as you know. We have money enough to live in ease and plenty all the rest of our lives, and I could be happy if I thought that you spoke the truth." "As Heaven is my witness, Clara, I do. With all my heart, I love you." While the passengers still slept there suddenly arose an awful cry, which echoed fearfully-on the still night air. "Fire! fire!" Jesse Dumar, rushing from the lower deck, found a dense smoke issuing from the lower hatchway over the hold. The captain, the first mate, and the other officers, had as soon as possible got the pumps to work, but they were not in very good order, and the flames steadily gainll headway. Although the pumps were worked with unflinch- ing perseverance, the raging element could not be kept under. The centre part of the deck was all in flames. The crew and those helping them were driven to the stern of the vessel. The shrieks and moans of the dying came up to those on deckl, but they could do nothing to help them. No ship hove in sight. The flames now spread with fearful rapidity. The boats were launched, though there was scarcely I any hope of their living in such a sea. The first was immediately swamped. It contained, amongst others, the captain, who had lost all control over himself, L. and seemed mad with terror. The sec- L ondwas lowered, but, drifting under the vessel's side, was struck by the s screw, and went down almost instantly. e A third boat was launched, but met t with as terrible a fate. Many tied them- ;, selves to spars and jumped overboard. The mizenumast fell and the mainmast , followed witl a crash. As day broke d the last charred remains of the doomed ship sank beneath the waves. Shortly after the body of a woman, securely fastened to one of the doors of the ves- k scl, was driven among the rocks upon s the coast. A fisherman plying Iis trade r was the first to find her. Round her e neck, attached by a small chain, was a - water-tight packet. Taking his knife - from his pocket, he cut it open, and ut- i- tered an exclamation of intense astonish- 1. ment when his eyes fell on a mass of glittering gems. While he was look-   ing at thlem another fisherman joined him. "See here," said the first. "Ah!" "If they're real, Jack, I'll tell you one thing, gua fortun's made.', "They'r t ot ours." "Why not? No one's here to- say us nay. No one but her." "What shall we do with her?" "Drop her down again into the sea. Lend a hand." The ruffians stooped over the woman's prostrate form. But as they did so she slowly opened hei eyes and gazed upon them. "Great i-eavens!" exclaimed one of the men, and, loosing his hold, he turned to fly. CHAPTER  XXX. WITH a startled shriek, Rose started to her feet. But the hags surrounding her were so many that it was worse than madness to hope to oppose her feeble strength to their attack.  "Mercy! mercy!" shrieked the unhappy girl. Every one had a different mode of torture to suggest, and every one con- sidered her own idea the best. The poor girl was first to be thrown into the water, to sec if she would really sink. If not, she was, as they had call- ed her before, a witch. "Good, good!" cried one old hag, considerably more hideous than the rest. "The water, tie water!" "To be sure, my dears," continued the former old harridan. "If she floats then we can grill her afterwards. If she sinks, why then she'll have been finish- ed off in a style which is much too easy for the likes of her!" "The water, then!" "May she swim!" quoth Mistress Madge, in fervent anticipation of the continuation of the torture feast upon the unhappy victim of their fury. Even Mistress Madgc's tortures could not endure forever, and at length the operation of fastening the doomed girl was complcted. "Help! help! oh, help!" shrieked thle unhlappy lose, in L ifrenzy'of terror, as ;he awful moluiment drew nearer. ' Now then!" iTw o of the women-U-one of whom was old Mi\stress Maldge-raised the helpless body of the lhalf-senseless victim in their armIs.   The waters closed over it, and in an instant appeared to regain their former tranquility, as if they were anxious that all traces of the fiend-like cruelty should be cleared away with the execu- tion of the deed of violence. "Down she goes!" cried Madge. "Ay, tshe sinks." "I can see her still. There, now she's lost." "What a feels  for the fishes." Tio pleasantry created an immense amount of laughter and jocularity, and the gang of wretched women  moved off. The woman who had destroyed the innocent girl had ibarely cleared off when from the branch of a large spread- ing tree which overhung the water the body of a tall, stalwart fellow appeared. Apparently this man was an expe- rienced diver, for he cut through the water without the faintest splash. It was a prodigous dive! Down, down he went to a very great depth with out- stretched hands. Straight as a die he made the plunge for the sunken body of Rose Seymour. A terrible time did he appear to be under water, and had any one been present he must have concluded that the bold diver had perished for his temerity. But no! No matter the cause of such bravery, the boldness with which the object was carrie TYeserved success. Presently there was a faint movement perceptible just below the surface of the water.  Gradually it grew plainer. Then might be distinctly made out the outlines of two bodies. One was that of the bold and fearless diver. The other that of the inanimate girl, which he grasped around the waist with his left arm.       With his disengaged arm he made vigorous efforts to swim to the surface. Tlhe weight was great, however, to his well-nigh used up force, and his pro- gress was but slow. At length, he bore her safely to the bank. Thiere was the rescued girl still in- sensible, to all appearance dead. "She's a longr time without breathing, ' said the swimmer, staggering to his feet. "Surely she can't be dead. No, I hope -Good God!-I- H" And, staggering, he turned a kind of pirouette uponl one heel, and fell fiat upon his back beside the body of the unhappy Rose Seymour. He had lain thus insensible about Den  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6980-00000050"/> minutes when a third person arrived upon the scene. It was another of the gang who had witnessed the whole of the dispute be- tween Miles Trunnion and Penryth, and. having heard of the murder of the former by the girl whose possession had been disputed, 11e lhad come in pursuit. Great was his surprise, when upon reaching t,he river's bank lie discovered not only the girl who had unwittingly caused so much strife and mischief, but also the half-drowncd diver who had worked such miracles in her rescue. As tle newcomer approachlled the body of the man lie started back in grea'Ct alarm. "Good Heavens!"   he  ejaculated. "Pcnryth here, too ." Tile gallant swimmer whlo lad so nearly sacrificed himself to preserve Rlos Seynlour's life was nolne other than lher llherculean chalmpion who lad ,shaill AMiles Trunnion. it So, so!" muttered the manl, "Hthink I can see through all this now. I mar- velled much at first that such a deed of violence should have been wrought by that delicate little hand." As he contemplated the insensible man he looked like a fieud, ready upon at given signal to cut the slight thread which still held him to life. Had he been aware that the man still breathed there is a great probability that another crime would have been added to that day's fearful work. Then as he turned towards the motionless form   of our heroine his rough, brutal features soft- ened into an expression of something almost approaching tenderness. Sud- denly he started back, with a- cry of astonishment--"She moved!" He was tolerably  acquainted with the treatment necessary for bodies after a ln'r immersion in water, and therefore tenlldetd lt ;t little to revive the faint anfimatioi whlli(It was now beginning to make itself apparent. "If Penryth should happenl to wake up, too, I should ilnisli lim, I'm mortal sure," he muttered between his teeth. Raising the now breathing but insen- sible gill in hisis brawny arms, I e} walked hastily from the spot. He paused before a low hut, built of brick, and shIt iII 1by tL wooden door, 1tD(ni wlehich was ;th inscription almlost olliterated by a1ge. Aiter looking anxiously about, to see it' lie litl( lbeel oblserved, the man plushed open the. door aid eintered the hut. As lie did so the saturated gariment of i'lis i;nse nlsi ble   burthen caught in a splinter in rte woodwork. Then the door was closed without noise. Penryth recovered. Ho staggered to his feet. His legs and arms were most painfullf cramped from the great exertion hoe had under- gone and the cold and damp he hadlaid in so long. "Ah A!" le cried of a sudden, his eyes fixed upon the ground, by the river's bank. "' There's been something here whilst I was fainting. Here's the foot- mark, and a man's too. Her dress has been dragged along the ground, too. And- Hllo!  Why, as sure as fate he's taken her in his arms, and carried her off. Here they've gone." At lenCI he came to a large patcll of moist clay soil, which he examined eagerly. "Huzzah! huzzah!" lie cried. "I have thel  now. There's his big: footmarks. And, theln. nowfor it.'" After a long ssearch lie calme in front of the wooden door of the hut into which: Rose was borne by the quarryman. - piece of her dress was yet clinging to the splintered wood which had caught upon entering. At Sight of tlis Penryth turned ghastly pale. "He's taken her down to the Danger Quarry!" he muttered. t' Then by --  she's lost to me." He entered with a fixed determina- tion, muttering aloud as he went: "I'll go.  I'll follow them to the bottom of the Danger Quarry, though it- fall in and be the grave of us all." CIIAPTEPl XXXI. Rose had recovered when Penryth reached the bottom of the quarry. The brutal man huggled her in his hideous embrace with such warmth that Rose was filled  alarm. Now she appre- hendedl the worst of Penryth. "All it ain't no use of yott to wrig- gle and wriggle and try to worm your- self out of my arms. You can't do it." "Beware now you go there," said ' What do ou mean?" Tf "  lia'1C ther is a pit somewhere about thlls D't of the quarry." "h011! you appear to know everything about it, I think, my gal." "Because he told me of it." "He? Who?" "He that brought me here--lhe who will never move hence."   "' What do you mean?" "That he has fallen down the pit." Penryth was not a, little startled at this at first. However, he very speedily got over any little unpleasant sensations which this intelligence at first occasioned him. "Ah, well, he won't trouble us much with his conmpany," he said. "NOT SO LAST, PENRYTH!'" said a voice at his elbow. Penryth and Rose turned round hor- ror-stricken. It was the voice of the man who had brought her down the quarry. "Wat LynwoodO."  , '"Yes" said the mai.  -*It is even Wat Lynwood, Penryth." "Oh1 how glad I am!" said Rose. "No doubt."  "Indeed I anm.  I feared that you had fallen down the pit." The fellow burst into a coarse, brutal "Of course you did," he said. "I in- tended that you should.

I mean Miles Trunnion." With a howl more like that of a wild beast than any human cry, Penryth re- leased his hold of Rose and sprang for- a ward upon Lynwood. "Wat Lynwood," he hissed into the other's car, " you have settled this ques- tion in that breath. Either you or I iremain behind in the Danger Quarry." "You be it, then." "I think not." "Pray, pray be calm," said Rose, in -   an agony of fiight- "All riilght, lass. Stand clear." The two  grasped each other in a ; deathke emlbrace. "Now, Wat Lynwood," said Penryth, "Iet me tell you that you lie in your cussed throat." "The lie is yours." "Not so. But, if it were true, the boast you make is idle-" "Idle, forsooth?"

It was life and death. They swayed and rolled off together from the spot. Now Rose had an idea. If she possessed herself of the lantern she might be enabled to escape whilst the fatal combat pro- "eded. In an instant she had pounced lupon it, andi secrcted it beneath her dress. Seo then ran some ten or twelve yards from  the spot. The scuffling (1111nd alon1 now told of the deadly struggle which was taking place. Occasionally a   dull thud told her  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6980-00000051"/> that one of the brutal combatants had received a fearful blow. Then, with a shudder, she would increase the dis- tance between herself and the struggling Turning her back upon the two ruf- fians, she, began to survey the place by the aid of the lantern. As she raised it it strulck against a cord. Eagerly she looked up. It was the rope by whose aid Penryth had de- scended. Was it not possible for her to escape by it. Tile first thing she did was to fasten the lantern round her waist. Then she took the rope in her delicate palms, clutched at the nearest knot, and drew herself up. There were large knots at every foot or eighteen inches' distance in the rope, which greatly facilitated her progress. Still the rope swayed about, and she felt uncomfortable. Still the sounds of the fatal strife could be plainly heard. Suddenly she was forced to pause, in spite of herself, to listen-to listen in silent terror? A desperate blow had been struck by one of the combatants, and the receiver ut- tered a hollow  groan. Dismally it echoed through the sombre impenetra- ble labyrinths of the mine. A wild shout of triumph burst from the lips of one of them-whose, Rose was unable to distinguish. "Where are you, ceh" demanded the victor-in a hoarse voice, "IWhere's the gal got to?" continued   the victorious ruffian. 1"Where are you? Answer, or I'll precious soon find the means to make you, you Jezebel. Rose began to recover her senses, and her flight was resumed. Now, unhappily the rope she was de- scending mnade a, grating noise, similar to that lwhich she had noticed at the de- scent to PenrTyth into the mine. "Ha :,;!' hie cried with an oath, "you're got there, have you. Down you collie." Rose, to her terror, felt the rope tugged from below. She still held firmly, though. She felt that she was giving way. The rope was slipping through her hands. Suddenly her attention was attracted by a strange sound. The earth above began to fall upon her head. The quarry uwas giving vay! She now comprehended the meaning of its too significant title--the "Danger Quarry!" Barely had the thought flitted through her mind-compressing the pent-up ter- rors of a lifetime into those few brief moments-when there was a terrific crash. Down came the earth rolling into the fathomless depths of the fatal quarry. THE DANGER QUARRY HAD EARNT ITS TITLE!
