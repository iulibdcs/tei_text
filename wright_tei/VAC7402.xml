And the boy's curly head was buried in the quilts again, and his sobbing became almost convul- sive. "Roy, darling," and the lady's voice trem- bled; " if you love me be calm; it hurts me to see you so unhappy. Bring my medicine." "Oh, mother, I forgot!" he answered, rising from his kneeling posture, frightened out of his grief by her pallor. (5)  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7402-00000004"/> Koy's Search. In a few moments she was easier, and Roy sat very quietly by her bedside, her transpa- rent hand clasped in his chubby palm. e was trying hard to keep back the tears that would come blinding his eyes every now and then. "Do you feel better, mother?" he asked, at last. "Yes, dear, quite nicely ;-and now, while I am strong, I think I will tell you a story; shall I?" "O yes, indeed,'&amp; cried the lad, eagerly, but adding, " that is if you feel well enough."  "I may never have another chance," said Mrs. Horton sadly. "Q&amp;uite a number of years ago,--you was a little baby then, Roy,--I was travelling in the cars, when suddenly a whleel broke and the train was stopped for repairs. How vividly I remember the place-a beauti- ful station in the country, where the scattered farm-houses, peeping out from among a  lux-   A Stranlge Revelation.    7 riance of orchards and shade-trees, made the valley a picture of contentment, peace and plenty. Some of the passengers, impatient of delay, vented their ill-humor in short, snarling speeches, while others amused themselves by strolling about the fields, picking ripe berries, or helping themselves to the fruit that hung so temptingly from tie apple-trees. An hour had passed. I was absorbed watching  the scene without, when   my  attention was arrested by an exclamation from a lady whose face struck me as remarkably beautiful and intelligent,--but who seemed to be in trouble. "O  dear, what shall I do?" she uttered; and her countenance became ashy pale, " he's been drinking again!"' She was three seats before me, and there were no other passengers near. She seemed to be watching some person firom the window with intense and painful interest. Turning  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7402-00000005"/> - Roy's Search. quickly, she exclaimed, in low and hurried tones: "My poor husband has only one fault, madam, and he is not wholly to blame for that; he is at times intemperate, and it makes him perfectly crazy. May I leave my babe with you a moment while I go to him?" As I held the bright-eyed finely-formed little boy, my eyes followed the white-faced another as she hurried across the fields to a distant store where was gathered a- crowd of men and boys. The bell rangy Just then, and the train started, leaving me with the infant in my arms.  For many miles we swept on before the conductor came, to whom I stated the incident. "The best I can do for you, madam," said he, "is to let you get off at the first depot, and take the next train for the station where the lady was left behind;" and he thoughtfully * *"    A  Strange Revelation.  handed me a return ticket.  It was some hours before the train came, and when I reached the station, I found that the young couple had gone, no one knew where. In the carpet-bag, left by the mother, among various articles of baby attire, was a pocket Bible, in which the owner's name was written in a, delicate female hand, and a likeness of the mother herself. But I must cut my story short, for I am growing tired. I inquired far and near for the parents, and advertised for them in the papers, but never afterwards heard from them." "But what became of the dear baby?" asked Roy. "He is still with me." "With you!" exclaimed the lad, and he began to doubt whether her mind was not wandering. "Yes, dear, you were that little baby!"  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7402-00000006"/> 10      SRoy' Search. "i e!" cried the boy, springing to his feet, "am I not your own Boy?" "No, dear child, I am not your mother; I have kept this from you, knowing it would only make your young life sad, and hoping still that in God's good time your true mother would be found; and now I feel that if I only knew that you would be cared for, I could die in peace." "Oh, don't say that!'" said Roy, brokenly, ti he tears rushing to his eyes again, "what should I ever do without you?" "Roy," she replied, "in my trunk is a carpet-bag; bring it to me, and I will show you sonmething to comfort you." The lad looked on with wonderincg eyes, as with trembling hand she drew from the reti- cule an elegant pocket Bible with gilt edges and silver clasp. "This was the carpet-bag your mother left     behind," she said, and, opening the book to the fly-leaf, " here is her name, written by her mother, I suppose, for the book seems to have been a birth-day present. And here," she continued, drawing forth and opening a neat case; "are likenesses of your parents and yourself." It was a pretty picture; the boy gazed long land earnestly at the group on the pliate,--a well-dressed, smart looking man, and a lovely lady holding a plump smiling infant. "Were those my father and mother?" he asked, with a throbbing heart. , "Yes, dear!" "And that baby?" "Was little Roy! This carpet-bag and all it contains are yours now, Roy. I know well how you will prize them; how sacred they will be to you."  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7402-00000007"/> 1 2     Roy's Searcl, And the boy, unable longer to control his feelings, wept aloud. "Don't Roy; don't cry so. Here, pass me the Bible, and I will find a passage that was placed in it by your Heavenly Father espe- cially for you."' And turning to the twenty- eighth psalm, tenth verse, she bade him read: "When my father and mother forsake me, then the Lordwill take me up." "There, Roy, is your text, in the very book that was left with your clothes when your father and mother forsook you so suddenly and mysteriously. I will turn down the leaf at the place, and I want you to read it often after I am gone-will you not?" There was a tap at the door, and Roy opened it to admit the portly form of their good landlady, Mrs. Mayfield. "How are you to-day?" asked she, cheerily. "Why you look as bright as a button; we'll   A Strange Revelation.    13 have you trotting about soon, as smart as the best of us; wont we, Roy?" The boy's face brightened, and Mrs. Horton could not help an answering smile. ",See wat I have brought you," she con- tinued, in the same breath; "some beautiful chicken, and nice jelly!" "Thank you," said Mrs. Horton, with a grateful look, "I am sorry to have put you to so much trouble on my account." "Not a bit of it," answered the widow; "and now I am going to send Roy down to see my Betsy while I talk with you awhile." Roy's face clouded over. "Please, Mrs. Mayfield," he cried, "I don't want to leave; I want to see her all the time; for she says "- but the choking sobs stopped his utterance. "Nonsense, child," said Mrs. Mayfield; "you are all tired out. Bun down-stairs, and  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7402-00000008"/> I  -  14.

The dying woman's eyes followed the child with a wistful tenderness in their depths, till the door closed, shutting him from view, then she turned to Mrs. Mayfield: "Oh, my dear friend!" she said, earnestly, "there is no longer any room  for hope. I have but a few hours to spend in this world- the end is almost here, and before I go, I wish to commit my darling to your care. Keep a watchful eye on him--and God will reward you, for I cannot." "Make  yourself easy," responded Mrs. Mayfield, wiping  her eyes on her checked apron. "If I were only rich I'd make a gentle- man of him;  but I'll do my best by him, and he shall never come   to want while I have a crust!" Mrs. Horton could only reply by a   silent iS.

Then feeling of her pulse, he looked grave. ' Give her ths every half hour till I call again!" he "added, and without another word left the room. The 'day passed slowly away, and as evening drew on the invalid seemed better. Roy had watclled every change with an eagerness that -distressed her. He would not stir from her beclside, but seemed to feel as if his watch- ing would keep the chdread event away.  Lateo  in the evening Mrs. Mayfield came in, and found the boev sitting on a cricket at the foot of the bed, -with his eyes fixed onl the sick woman's face. "Go to bed, Roy," she whispered, "I will stay with her." 9  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7402-00000009"/> 16      Roy's Search. The words, gently as they were uttered, woke the sleeper. "Yes, Roy darling, you must rest," said she, "I feel better;" and with infinite tender- ness kissed him long and lovingly. "She is going to get well," he thought, as he saw her bright eyes and fushed cheeks, and full of this happy thought, the child dis- missed sadness from his heart and fell asleep. The gray light of dawn -was just making objects visible, when Roy was awakened by a quick shaking, and through his sleepy eyes he saw Mrs. Mayfield. "Wake up," she whispered, "your mother is dying!" He sprang up, pale and trembling, and was hurrying to the door, when the lady detained him. "Softly, softly, dear, or you will make her worse."   ' A Strange Revelation.    17 The struggle was almost over; the sick woman's breath came at long intervals, but she smiled on the child, despite her distress. "Roy, be a good boy and meet me in heav- en. I am going to Jesus,--he will-bear me over the river "- The words grew fainter, and when Roy raised his head from her bosom she was gone. "Oh, mother, mother, come back to me! Oh, mother, let me go with you!" he pleaded; but the cold features and rigid lips seemed only to. mock him, and with a cry that rang through the house, he fell senseless beside  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7402-00000010"/>  WHAT was to be done withI Roy? This question troubled the good- hearted Mrs. Mayfield not a little. The last sad rites were over, the burial ex- penses paid from the widow's scanty purse. "It would be a shame," she warmly averred, "for such a real born lady to beg from the city a place for her innocent body." She would gladly have adopted Boy, whom she really loved, but she was herself poor. The question that troubled landlady May- field, was pondered more anxiously by Roy. He was a manly boy, old beyond his years, and dependence galled him. Then, night and   yeededialh Spraguze, Jr.   9 day he thought of what the dearly loved Mrs. Horton had told him, and an intense yearn- ing for his long-lost mother,--for lhis affec- tions seemed to go out after her more tlan his father,--grew in intensity. Often would he secretly take the amabrotype from its place in the carpet-bag and gaze long and wistfully at her sweet face, sometimes fancying that the life-like image was about to pronounce his name. Then, with a sigh, he would put back the picture, and say to himself, "If I only could find her! Was she poor or rich? Had she forgotten her baby-boy,'or was she still mourning for him? Is she still alive?"' These and similar inquiries would arise in his mind, to be thought over and laid by unsettled for the hundredth time. He lost his appetite, grew pale and absent, till Mrs. Mayfield, alarmed, privately gave it as her opinion that the lad was "following his mother." She had not been  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7402-00000011"/> 20      Roy's Search. told his history, and always spoke of Mrs. Horton in that way. Roy was the first to broach the dreaded sub- ject. He was standing by her side one day as she was cooking, ready to run and wait upon her. "Mrs. Mayfield," said he, suddenly, "I want to earn my own living."  "Bless my heart, child, what can yore do?" "Oh, most anything," answered he, proudly. "I can black boots." She held up her fat hands in horror; while her perspiring face glowed with indignation.' "Davis taught me how," added Roy, apologetically. "I can do housework; I can sweep; and make beds, tip-topJ" But the mention of these last-named' ac- complishments was too much for her good nature, and Mrs. Iayfield broke into a hearty laugh.   yeedialh Sprag'ue,  %r.   2  "Shall you hire out for cook, or chamber- maid?" she asked, shaking her sides with merriment. "Please do not make fun of me," said Roy, soberly. "Mother told me before she 'went to heaven,"-and his voice grew thick,--"to try and take care of myself. I must never be a burden to any one." "I know you'll never be that, dear," re- turned Mrs. Mayfield, wiping her own eyes, "we'll try and see if there cannot be found someothing for you to do; till then, you must be content where you are." "Hello, bub!" called out a rough boarder, one day, who had been absent, " you hanging around yet? I declare for it, I'd run off afore I'd eat other folks' victuals!" Roy made no answer to the loud-spoken words, but rushed to his little room, and throwing himself on the bed, burst into tears.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7402-00000012"/> "It isn't my fault," lhe sobbed. "Oh, fa- ther! mother! why did you leave me? Dear Mrs. Horlto, whly did you die?" He cried until he was exllausted, and then lay and thought. "I'll do it!" he exclaimed, suddenly spring- ing up in his impulsive way. "I will run off, as that ugly Smith said. They'll all be glad to get rid of a good-for-nothing boy that costs so much, and who knows but I may come across mother or father!" With characteristic promptness, Roy began to make arrangements for his departure. He remembered that Mrs. Horton found him in the country, and hle decided to make that his destination; as to where the country was, however, he had not the slightest idea. But one day, before morning broke, he started on his journey in excellent spirits, grief and every sald emotion being swallowed up in the grand    project of "seeking his fortuune," and his long lost mother. Stealing softly into Mrs. Mayfield's )iivato room, he put the following note on the table: "Dear Mrs. Mayfield i am Going to seek my fortune pleas not try to find me for you kant i want to thank you for what you hav done For me som day i will pay you. ROY." His valuables were packed in' his mother's  carpet-bag. They consisted of her Bible, the prized ambrotype, an old purse containing twenty-five cents,-earned by blacking boots for the boarders,--and in one corner his last night's supper. Thus equipped' he   passed quietly out of doors. "Good-by, old house!' he cried, turning to get a last look. "It'll be some time before you have the  pleasure of seeing this fellow  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7402-00000013"/> 24      Roys Search. again, I'm thinking;' and doffing his cap, he made a farewell bow, and started cheerily on his way. But now came a poser; whllat direction should he take? He looked to all points of the compass, but was no wiser. "They say the country's all around; so it can't make odds which way I go," he con- cluded at last, and walked along. All hour elapsed, and still no signs of the country! Morning dawned blighltly, and the sun began to show his iyellow face above the brick buildings. Roy was faint and tired. He had not breakfasted, so he looked about for a place in which to eat his lunch. Near at hand was a market. There were no purchasers around; only a few country people with their produce. Roy seated him- self on one of the side steps, and began munch- ing his bread and cheese. He became so occu-   7edeediah Sprague, Jr.    25 pied with this employment, and revolving his great project, that he unconsciously exclaimed aloud: "If I could only get there!" "Get where?" Roy sprang to his feet in astonishment. Before him stood a tall, bony young man of eighteen or twenty, his hair fiery red, and a tlhickly freckled face. He wore a pair of green pants, and a blue swallow-tailed coat, glisten- ing with brass buttons, and a broad-brimmed straw hat. He had a shrewd, raw look. "Where do you want to navigate to, young- ster?" he inquired, patronizingly. "Where, what?" asked Roy. "O ho! so you d  get my my meaning. Per- haps you never studied the art of speaking and writing the American language with pro- priety. ' Well then, in plain English, where do you wish to go?"  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7402-00000014"/> 26      Roy's Searoch. ---ixO- "Into the country," answered Roy. "I can't find out how to get there, though." "Nothing easier!" replied his interrogator. "Oh, please tell me," cried the lad excitedly. "I've been trying all the morning to find out; please tell me!" "Well," said the other, resting his thumbs in his pants pockets, " if you follow that perpen- dicular nose of yours, you'll come. there first or last!" "You're a great blustering greny!" angrily retorted the disappointed Roy. "I asked you - a civil question!" "Now don't get out of temper," replied the stranger, coaxingly. "I was only joking. But lwhat do you want to go into the country for?" "To earn my living," answered Roy; and then in a few touching words he told his story. His listener's eves swami with tears. "And you thought you could find you way     into the country ath alone? But' I like your spirit; and I tell you what, as sure's my name is Jedediah Sprargue, Jr." and he gave the boy a friendly slap that nearly upset him, "You'll go along with me. Father's a farmer, and lhe wants a chore boy. He said to me as I came away, 'Jedediah, when you are at New York travelling around and spending your money, if you come across a likely boy, bring him home,' and if this isn't what mother calls a providence, my meeting you here, I declare I don't know what is! I feel just like the Prophet Baalam meeting the ass. Did you ever read the ac- count?" "No," said Boy, puzzled to make out what connection that had with him. "Then your education has been sadly neg- lected. Bnt never mind, pick up your duds, and come along,"' and catching the boy's hand he hurried him on at a rapid pace.  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7402-00000015"/> 28      Roy's Search. Jedediah strode on awhile, and then stopped at a large boarding-house. With an enormous stride he was up the steps, leaving Roy behind, wondering at the length of his friend's legs. "We'll have something to eat first," said he, "you look as thin as a winter chicken." He led the way into the dining-room; Roy, boy-like, at Jedediah's invitation, did ample justice to the fare. He ate a hearty breakfast, and then sat back and watched his companion with great interest. His was a rough, but kindly face, and the boy felt that notwith- standing his eccentric ways he would be a friend to him. At last Jedediah stopped eating, and pulled out a large silver watch. "Seven o'clock precisely," said he, pom- pously; "I must stop eating; I have heaps of business on hand." "It is only quarter before seven by the   yedediah Spjrague, yr.    29 clock," returned Roy, pointing to one that hung at the end of the room. "That waiter always will keep his time wrong!" cried Jedediah, in a vexed tone. I've told him the right time again and again, but it don't make any difference.

The fellow was going to palm off one of the little mean ones on me, but I told him I wasn't going to have none of his cheats. When I have a watch, I want one that's got the silver in it. How much do you suppose the critter cost?" "I do not know," said Roy. "Thirty-five dollars," answered Jedediah, proudly. "Just think of it; only thirty-five dol- lars for that lump of silver!

Wont I be glad when I get out of this stingy city, where a fellow can't open his jaws without paying fifty cents." After settling his bill he hurried across the city, and entered a large building, which he in- formed Roy was the depot. "I left my baggage heref this morning ready for an early start," said lie, " and now I must go and see to it;" and rushing down i the long platform to a door at the lower end, he called out: "Hello, Baggage-master, where's the truck I left in your care?" "Do you think I am deaf?" gruffly answered the surly official. Just then a car-bell-rang. "There, the cars are starting!" exclaimed Jedediah. "Look here, mister, give me them things quick, or I'll lose the train ;" and catch- ing up his' bagage,' which consisted of a hat-   , edediah Spraguze, yr.    3r box, a huge carpet-bag, and a big bundle, he made a rapid exit. The train starting, however, proved not to be the one they wrere going in; but after much inquiry the bustling Jedediah and Roy were seated in the cars bound for the farmer's home. "And so you say that your parents left you in the cars, and that's the last you saw of them, or rather they of you," said Jededialih, after having comfortably disposed of his feet on the seat before him. "Yes," answered Roy, the tears starting. "Well, never mind, don't feel bad. Perhaps I'll light upon them yet. I travel some and always endeavor to keep one eye open;" and despite his inevitable humor his own eyes grew moist. "Just give me a squint at their picture."

Jedediah scrutinized it in various postures, glancing critically the while at the lad by his side, and having deliberately formed his opin- ion, said: "You're the one that the picture belongs to, youngster, I'm convinced. And you needn't be a mite or a grain ashamed to own your folks. They are a respectable looking couple: and as to that, they needn't ran away from you again, as if you were over ugly : they'll own you without doubt, and be glad of the chance. But the first thing is to bring the parties to- gether. You say they left you in the cars?" "Yes," said Roy, anxiously, for his friend's manner gave assurance that something w-as about to be done of an important nature. "Well, then, its natural to suppose that you'll find them in the cars!" O   Jededialh Sfrague, .r.     33 That looked plausible to Roy. "Now, then, I'll .give you my motto. I'll show it to you in my old copy-book when I get home: ,' A man of words and not of deeds, Is like a garden full of weeds.' There's more truth than poetry in that, accord- ing to my thinking.

"Conductor," said he, stopping that worthy, "here's an unfortunate orphan,-though he isn't exactly an orphan,---who has lost his fa- ther and mother in the train!" "What's that?" asked the conductor, gravely, while many   eyes from  adjacent seats were fixed on the loud-voiced Jedediah, "I say that this boy has been deprived of both his parents at one fell stroke. That is to say, they forsook him.

"Are these the father and mother?" asked the official, taking the case in his hand with evident interest.  "Yes," returned Jedediah, " and that likely looking child is the one they left. You see it was when the lad was a baby that they dis- appeared, leaving "- "Faugh!" ejaculated the irate conductor, and he passed to the next car, slamming the  door after him, while the neighboring passen- gers gave vent to their feelings by a prolonged titter. Jedediah's ire was roused. "All that man -can think of is tickets! What's a lost child or lost parents to him, , compared with a piece of red paper that cost fifty cents! We'll see for ourselves. 'He that  would thrive must hold the plough or drive.'

Who's lost a boy!" peering as he went into every man and woman's face; tarrying now and then to answer questions; telling Roy's story in a quaint roundabout way; and show- ing the likeness of the trio. Once he was quite sure he had found the missing pair and insisted upon it in his zeal, till the couple got wholly out of patience. But Roy did not find his father or mother, and our travellers were glad when after much changing cars, and fruit- ess searching, they at last took the coach for Naplewood. There Jedediah found two  old clhool-fellows, and seemed to  recover his nergy in relating his exploits, exhibiting his lump of silver,' the ambrotype, and Roy.

"They'll think it's the parson," said he, his honest face aglow with the pleasure of getting home. "Now for a rouser!" And giving some tremendous raps with the heavy brass knocker, in a few moments foot- steps were heard in the hall, the door swung ajar, and a comely matron looked out. "O Jedediah," she cried, affectionally kiss- ing him, " have you got back safely?" "Safe as a kitten! But see what I have brought," pulling Roy forward. "I'll tell you all about him by-and-by. We're awful hun- gry; come from New York since morning!" Thle family were assembled for supper. Jedediah Sprague, Senior, was a tall, power- fully built man, with a blunt, pleasant way. He was glad to see his only son, and wel-   redediah Spra ag'e,  r.   37 comned Roy heartily, and the two were soon seated at the bountifully spread table. "Now, mother," remarked Jedediah, when his appetite was appeased, "I must tell you how I picked up this poor chick!" He then rehearsed the meeting between Boy and himself in a sympath;iing  jocoAe way, that made Mrs. Sprague laugh and cry by turns. "Well, my brave lad," said Farmer Sprague, "you shall have a home here as long as you behave yourself. No one shall say that the Spragues ever saw any one in trouble and re- fused to lend a helpiug hand!" At which Mrs. Sprague tenderly kissed Roy, saying, "Poor little wanderer!"

It was Farmer Sprague's thundering voice that awoke Roy; and the chorus of crowing, cackling, gobbling, and squalling from the barn-yard, fairly bewildered the city boy. It was as if he had opened his .eyes upon another world. He dressed, and hastened down the narrow back stairs. The farmer was at the table, eating as if for dear life. "Well, boy, next morning you musn't wait to be called," he said, as he gulped his coffee. "We are all up bright and early here. You'll find a place to wash in the shed."

"Well, bub," observed Bill Jones, shaking the water from his shaggy head like a big New- foundland, " so you're going to be a farmer?" "Yes," answered Roy, brightly, " though I don't know much about it, for I never was -in the country before." "You're mighty young to go among stran- gers," remarked Jim Gary. "He'll get toughened to it before long," said Bill, passing a large tin wash-basin to the boy. John Graham- a dark-faced lad several years older than Roy,-had been standing near combing his lhair, eyeing the new-comer with no pleasant looks meanwhle. He stepped up as Roy was about to wash, snatched the basin, and began coolly to use it himself.

"Shame on you!" said Bill; "if I was Roy I'd teach you better manners!" "Pooh, the little baby would be afraid to say boo!" replied John. "Would I'?" and Roy sprang at his tor- mentor with doubled fists. What was it that checked the descending blow? Two pictures hung on the walls of memory. One of two boys with passionate, angry faces, fighting like dogs, then a little further on the kind lady now dead pleading with one of the two. That sorrowful woman who had taken such tender care of him, he had promised never to strike a blow again except in self-defence. How vividly the scenes came up before him! Perhaps even now her eye was upon him! He dropped his hand and burst into tears.

Farmer Sprague seemed intent on finding out what Roy was worth, the latter thought, as he commenced job after job and was called off before it was completed to begin another. It was quite discouraging to the ambitious boy, who put his whole energy into the task before him. A long wearisome day it was, willing as he was to do. His limbs, back, and head, tlhrobbed, but he consoled himself with the ' thought that he was not dependent on kind Mrs. Mayfield. He was at work in the kitchen garden, try- jig to discriminate between vegetables and weeds, when Jedediah strode up. "Most beat out?" he inquired, as he saw the boy's weary face.

"Well, seeing that you are not tired in the least, and are so terrible smart, you may go over to the village, and help old Bet and me do an errand." Roy sprang briskly after Jedediah, but sud- denly his face sobered, and he said, faintly: "Perhaps your father wants me to finish weeding first?" "Weeding be hanged!" was the dutiful re- joinder. "I'll take care of that! You go and rig up and don't stop to talk by the way." Bet was soon harnessed into the old- fashioned buggy by Bill.

"Just like the parson!" answered the mo- ther, with a fond smile, for she knew that was what Jedediahl wished her to say. That drive was an important affair,-a sort of state occasion to Jedediall, arrayed in his new pants and coat, white vest, and tall beaver hat, and he was happy as a child. Perhaps the little kindness he had done to the friend- less boy beside him, also made his heart light. Even the old gray horse felt the influence of his young master's jubilant mood. How beautiful is the country to one who has never been outside the narrow streets of the dusty, crowded, noisy city! The breath of the clear pure air was delicious to Roy, and he sat quietly inhaling it, and gazing at the beautiful scenery spread out on every hand, till the little trials of the day faded fromn mind.  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7402-00000023"/> "    .

With these reflections a sense of his loneliness rushed upon him, and the big tears rolled silently down his cheels. A turn in the road brought Maplewood to view, and the boy's thoughts back to other topics, for Roy happily had a bright elastic spirit that would not allow him to grieve long. The village consisted of about a dozen dwell- ings, a school-house, and a store, which mlight have been called a 'museum,' such a variety of articles were gathered there. The post-office was kept in a corner. The low rooml was full of loungers and tobacco-smokers, all of whom stopped their various occupations as Jedediah entered.

"I say, young man, you don't feel above folks since you took to travellin,' do you?" added a stout man, with watery eyes, and red face, putting an enormous quid into his dirty mouth as lhe spoke. To the latter question Jedediah did not re- ply, but turned his back on the speaker, and asked rather stiffly for his mail. "Take my advice, Jed," said another toper, "and don't let prosperity harden your heart. And don't wear your best duds every day, but stick to your work, and you'll be respected!" A coarse laugh from the rest of the company followed, and Jedediah hastened out of the shop, got into the wagon, and started the old mare up at a pace that quite bewildered her.

"They'll all"--he began, hotly, but the sentence was left unfinished, and Roy glanced up in wonder. Tripping down the country-road towards them, came a rosy-cheeked bright-eyed girl. She, opened her black eyes very wide on seeing the occupants of the buggy, and then recogniz- ing Jedediah, nodded. Jedediah returned the salutation by a nervous, irritated bob of the head, for he had not recovered his wonted complacency. Anxious, however, to please the fair maiden, and make amends for his want of courtesy, he recalled the manner of the New Yorlk exquisites, and caught spas- modically at his tall beaver, tipped it fiercely at the young lady, but alas! in his haste, he tipped it too far; the hat slipped from his hand and rolled under the wagon-wheel!

Fine clothes had made him contemptible to the store loungers, anld ridiculous to the one for whose sake he had taken his ride in his city outfit! "Thank you for my nice ride," said Roy, as they reached the barn. "You're welcome, and it i'sn't the last you'll lhave, either!" was the hearty reply. John .Graham entered the barn as these words were uttered. They stirred his evil nature' to its depths. "Isn't the last?" he muttered, angrily jeal- ous. "Before that boy came I rode with Jed, but he hasn't a word for me now. Any beg- gar picked up from the streets is better than I, who have lived here since I was a baby!"

As time passed on, it became evident to Roy that John Graham had come to regard him as an enemy ;.he wondered at the manifest hatred, and trembled when he saw him approach.

In a corner stood the old secretary, and the housewife searched its drawers faithfully, but the missing roll of bills was not there; and after looking and re-looking, Mrs. Sprague sat down and gave vent to her feelings in a tor- rent of tears. "I know it was there last night, for I count- ed the money the last thing before I went to bed. I don't know which way to turn now, Clara; if the money has gone for good, the farm must go too!" and the tears were in the Sman's voice as well as his eyes.

This being agreed upon, the supper-bell rang, and the farmer and his wife seated theem- selves at the table, as usual. "It seems just like suspecting one's own family," said Mrs. Sprague to herself, as she looked round at the men, who eat with the relish that hard labor gives to food.

All his little possessions were overhauled, and at last Mrs. Sprague came across a bunch of something in his stocking, and with a cry of joy pulled out the missing bills; While they were counting the money, Jede- diah came in. "What's the row?" he asked. The story was soon told, and Jedediah, turn- ing to the weeping boy, exclaimed, while he trembled with rage: "That's the way you pay me for getting you. a home, is it?"

The farmer and John Graham laughed a low derisive laugh, that made the boy's heart sink. Jedediah, however, became suddenly calm, and stood silenrtly studying the child's pleading, agonized countenance. "Somehow it seems mighty hard for me to believe you stole it," said he, meditatively. "I didn't take a cent of it!" reiterated Roy. "I know it looks as if I did,-I don't see how the bills came in my room!" "But I see!" retorted the farmer, "and I'll have you arrested.

Mrs. Sprague had been so kind to him, almost like a mother, and to be degraded in her eyes was quite too much to bear. The keener Jedediah watched the boy drooping under her words, and the feeling that lhe was unjustly accused, grew to a certainty.

"'I prayed to forgive him, and I will try to," he said in a moment, and his face brightened again.

"This way first," whispered the latter, and proceeding to the well-stocked pantry, he put in a generous supply of food. "I can't eat all that," whispered Roy. "Now let us start," said Jedediah. "I shall go a piece with you; I feel terribly about your going off alone, and if I could I'd go with you and take care of you." "Oh, I shall do well," answered Roy.

"If you don't I'll tear it to pieces," replied Jedediah. "Stow it away safely!" "But I shall pay it back," added Roy. And Jedediah, with many parting directions, and, lastly, a regular bear's hug, turned to return home, but shouted back: "Roy! Roy! I'll tell father and mother not to say a word to the hands about the five hun- dred dollars, and if John Graham opens his lips, I'll whale him till he learns to hold his tongue!"

A low whine startled hi'm, and looking around, he saw a little black dog, wagging his tail and looking at the food with a wistful ex- pression. "Hungry, are you?" said Roy; " good fellow, catch it!" and he threw him a piece of cold corned beef, which disappeared in a twinkling. "Well, you're jolly at eating," said Roy, feed- ing him again.

When the train thundered into Boston, Roy with Carlo at his heels got out with the other passengers. "Have a hack! have a hack! carriage, sir?" Roy decided he did not want one, being  moreover slightly in fear of the long brand- ishing arms and loud voices of the hackmen. So scarcely knowing what he did, he followed the crowd.

Mrs. Sprague was seated in her low rocking chair as she uttered this, a basklet of clothes just from the wash at her side, ready for mending.  She was absorbed in thought, wondering if indeed the noble-browed lad was guilty of the theft, and troubled as to what had become of him, when the clock struck four, simultaneously with a low knock at the outer door. She started and dropped her work, so deeply engaged was she,' and hurried to the door. There stood a pale thin woman of striking though faded beauty, and a little boy.

"Why, that's a mile from here, through the woods. You look tired,-wont you come in and rest?"And as the woman passed in, Mrs. Sprague was struck with the boy's counte- nance. A delicately fair face, framed with curling dark hair, and hazel eyes that met Mrs. Sprague's with an expression that made her start. Surely she had seen that face be- fore. "I knew we had neighbors at the old place." she said, as she handed her visitor a glass of water, " and was thinking of calling on them, but I have forgotten the name." "Mrs. Williams," was the answer, given in a pre-occupied tone; and to all of Mrs. Sprague's kind endeavors at conversation, her caller replied in a distant, abstracted way.   A  Tragedy, and a Gh}ost.   71 "Have you seen him?" she suddenly asked. Then quickly added without waiting for an answer, "No, no; he's gone, nobody knows ' where,--perhaps he's dead!" "Poor thing!" thought Mrs. Sprague, "she's overcome with her long walk in the heat," and, always hospitable, she urged her to stay to tea. The invitation was accepted by the lady. As Mrs. Sprague flitted in and out of the room, her caller's eyes followed her move- ments in a way that quite embarrassed her. The continual stare of those sorrowful, strange- ly-gleaming eyes growing terribly oppressive, the hostess was glad when her husband and his men came in to tea. She had been so flustered under the wo- man's magnetic gaze that she had almost for- gotten the bby. It was not until she saw her husband's perplexed, surprised look, as the  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7402-00000037"/> 12      Roy's Search. lad seated himself at the table, that she thought of him again. "Your boy's countenance seems quite fa- miliar to me," he said to 'Mrs. Williams. "Strange that I cannot recall who he reminds me of." "Don't you think he looks like Roy, hus- band?" asked Mrs. Sprague. "Yes, he does resemble him, but I hope he's a better boy!" At this the mother's orbs grew more rest- less, and the cup of tea she was carrying to her lips dropped from her hand and spilt on the table-cloth. "I am so nervous!" she apologized. "I am very sorry." "There is no harm  done," said Mrs. Sprague, deftly repairing the damage, but her heart had told her that some hidden trouble must be the cause of her visitor's agitation.   A T nragedy, and a Ghost.  73 Siupper having been clearedl away, her neighbor begted her so hard to accompany her part of the way throughl the woods that she consented.

The sun was two ho rs high, and it was a fervid day, in the latter part of May, but Mrs. Sprague shivered unaccountably as she walked by the woman's side up the lonely cart-path bordered densely with trees and underbrush. Beside his mother, - ith his hlands tightly clasped in hers, walked the boy. Mrs. Wil- liams was communicative by fits, and then she would relapse into gloomy silence. They had  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7402-00000038"/> 74      Roy's Search. come from the city, she said; her husband's health was poor and she was quite run down. She hoped the pure country air would restore them to health. Mrs. Sprague bade her adieu at the gate, and hastened away. "She has seen better days, I know, despite her worn clothes; (soliloquized the farmer's wife,) but what a nervous creature! Her sad, intense eyes haunt me still." And she, usually so fearless, experienced a timidity she had not known before, as she retraced her steps among the silent trees. The next day was Saturdlay, and. amid baking and churning, and an endless amount of housework, Mrs. Sprague scarcely thought of her visitor of the day before. But with the laying of the table-cloth for 'supper, the memory of her strange caller came freshy to mind. "I should really like to knowl that woman's   A Tragedy, and a Ghlost.    75 history," said Mrs. Sprague to herself, pausing in deep thought. "But what is that?" she exclaimed, with a look of terror, as a wild agonizing shriek was borne to her ears on the still air. Her heart gave a sudden bound, and stood still, as again and again it sounded. Conquering a feeling of faintness she hurried to the barn, where she met Mr. Sprague. "Husband," s he gasped, "some one is being murdered!" "No, no," he replied, "it's only a fight,' but he shuddered as the screams fell anew on his ears, and hurried in the direction from which they came. At the end of an hour Mr. Sprague returned. The screams he found proceeded from Mrs. Williams' place. The account he gave was touching and horrible. Mrs. Williams was a drunkard's wife, and the sufferings she had undergone in consequence, had so wrought on  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7402-00000039"/> 76      Roy's Search. her sensitive nature as to produce temporary insanity. She had conceived the idea that some evil power had the control of her destiny, and caused her troubles, and that to propitiate it she must shed the blood of her children, and -of as many others as she could. To accomplish this, for a week she had carried a razor in her bosom, and on that afternoon of her call, her object in inviting Mrs. Sprague to walk with her was to gain an opportunity to sacrifice her. But something kept her from it. The next 'day, however, she had made an attempt on Lucy, the youngest. Willie, the boy who had been at Mr3Is.

"The poor creature,-so lady-like when sane,-was covered with blood, raving and struggling with almost supernatural strength, as we tried to secure her; while two children were lying, for aught we knew, dead in their gore, and the young mother from the house across the way fainted and lay helpless.

"Come in like a man, and tell the old folks all about it!"

"Why," returned Jed, in tremendous excite- ment, " didn't I tell you Roy never stole that money? Speak up, Pat, and tell them what you saw!" and he gave the Hibernian a vigor- ous shake.

They 9 lighted up the large square room, and lay across the vacant seats, for their restless occupants had just been dismissed fo% the day, and  no one was left save the weary teacher, who sat with her head on her hand, 1 thinking, and in a seat half way up the room, a  girl, about fifteen years of age. Withl , downcast look she was bending   over a book, studying a lesson. "Are you prepared to recite now, Martha?" asked the teacher. (85)  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7402-00000044"/> 86      Roy's Search. "I don't know," was the low answer. "Come forward, and let me see." The girl came hesitatingly down the aisle. Miss Gray took the book, and asked a few questions, which were promptly answered. "Very well," said the teacher, pleasantly, not appearing to notice the unhappy expres- sion of her charge, ' you may go now." The pupil placed the book in her desk, and went for her hat and cloak. Miss Gray having seen that the desk and door were securely locked, the two left the house. They walked some distance in silence, Marjha waiting for her teacher to speak, and the latter occupied with her own thoughts. "Martha," said she, at length, "I was very sorry to detain you this afternoon. I fear I do not interest you in your studies." The girl did not reply, but kept her eyes fixed on the ground. Miss Gray continued: to,/ *v   Miss Gray's Story.     87 "I kept you after school because I wished to have a talk with you, and see if I could not find out why you fail so often in your les- sons."

Then adding, "there's no use in my try- ing to study; the girls despise me and call me the drunkard's daughter. I don't expect to be able to go to school long, if I do study. Some- times I wish I was dead!" Miss Gray gently laid her hand on the child's shoulder, saying, sympathizingly: "Poor girl! Your lot is indeed a hard one, but surely, dear child, there is One to whom you can go with your trouble. Is there not?" Martha still wept, but less violently. The kind woman at her side was deeply touched. "Martha," said she, "I have known trouble too, that seemed quite as hard to bear."  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7402-00000045"/> 88      Roy's Search. "Have you!" ejaculated the girl, checking her tears. "Yes, and perhaps it may help you bear yours, if I tell you about it. My father was but seventeen and my mother a year younger when they were married. They were petted, spoiled children, and as their parents would not consent to their union till they were older, they took the matter into their own hands and were secretly united. This was a dreadful blow to the parents. The young couple in process of time set up housekeeping, and for a while all went smoothly withl them, but mo- ther's imperious temper began to show itself, and as father was obstinate, it was a discord- ant little world that my eyes opened upon, and-I was scarcely three years old -lwhen my parents separated, and I was taken by my uncle James. My uncle's family consisted of himself, wife,   I iss G r ay's StoIo ,.   89 and their little Isabel. It was kind in them to adopt me, and they meant to treat me as a daughter; but they could not feel towards me as if I were their own, and, young as I was, I soon felt an unutterable longing for a mother's love. The sight of my little companions, happy with their own mother's love, would often make me go and cweep by myself. Aunt almost worshipped Isabel; and I soon found that I must give up everything to her. For instance, one day little cousin took a fancy to a pretty coral necklace given me by my grand- mother, and. which I had worn since babyhood. In spite of my tears,-for the Inmemento was very sacred to me,--I had to part with it, my aunt telling me I must let sister have it; it was bad to grow up selfish.' Under such treatment I grew old before my time. I did not know what it was to be a joyous, free- hearted, child, but looked out upon the world t     &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7402-00000046"/> \90      Roy's Search. with sad foreboding eyes. I rarely smiled, but went about my tasks with a sullen apathy O and indifference that I now see made meY few friends. But a change came at last. "One day aunt went out to make a call. She was a lively, gossiping young woman, and always left the children,--for Isabel had now a sister,-in my care while she was gone. - The fire in the grate needed replenishing, and I put on more coal.

But as I lingered on, helpless, unsightly, distressed, I could perceive that she became weary of my pre- sence, and that if I died I would not be missed only as it relieved her of a care that wore upon her patience. I cannot tell you how the knowledge of this roused a resentment that I was too feeble to show, but which burned in my breast like a consuming fire. Lying si- lently on my couch of pain, too weak to speak, my brain was unnaturally active; all the bitter past,--the abandonment of me by my parents, the slights and drudgery, and deprivations ex- perienced under my aunt's care, came up with strange vividness, every little annoying circum- stance, as well as the greater wrongs, ranging themselves before me as the links of a glowing chain, filling me with feelings that seemed to turn my nature to stone, or rather to wither  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7402-00000047"/> * 92      Roy'sS earch. -- ------O O0o- -- every tender and beautiful affection. My in- tolerable bodily anguish was at times lost in the fiery passions of my soul. I secretly cursed my parents, my aunt's household, and - , everything and everybody that I knew. Once, however, fatigued by the tortures of the body and the keener anguish of the mind, I fell into a singularly heavy sleep. How long I lay thus I knew not; but when I awolke I saw sit- ting by the little table on which my medicines were kept, a strange woman, sewing, with a -book open before her, on the pages of which she occasionally glanced. There was somnie- tliing in her appearance,--I could not tell what,-that made her seem to me different from any one I had ever seen; and, wondering why she was there, I determined to feign sleep and watch her. I noticed that occasionally a tear would drop on her work, and yet what seemed to me a strange contradiction, her   Miss Gray's Story.     93 countenance wore a look of serenity that awed me.   Who and what could she be? Why was she there?   Wherefore did she weep? that sweet, peaceful-looking woman! Her image is impressed on my memory as she appeared then, with her glossy hair, plain but tidy dress, loving black eyes, refined manner, and an expression of goodness on her pale spiritual face that made me, as I gazed at her throughl my half shut eyes, almost think she must be an angel. All this passed rapidly through my mind, for in a few moments the stranger arose and came to my bedside. "' Dear child,' she murmured, 'how long she has slept!' "Just then the door opened, and my aunt entered, and speaking to me, I opened my eyes, when she saidcl: "' Martha, tlis is s rs. Turner, a kind lady who has come to take care of you.

"' Poor little sufferer!' interposed the nurse, 'if I can do anything for her I shall be very thankful;' and the loving, tearful eyes con- vinced me that she meant more- than she said. "Oh, how the long Dweary hours of pain were lightened by her gentle ministrations! She was so affectionate and good that my pride melted, and ere I was aware I had told her all my griefs. Oh, how sympathizingly she listened; how wisely she dealt with my morbid fancies; leading by prayer and sweet counsel to One who when he was reviled, reviled not again, pointing out a way to be happy even in tribulation.

And taking her Bible from the stand, for it was that which I had seen her reading, she read me passage after passage' which seemed written for me. I had never been instructed in the Book of books, and like a soul hungry for the bread of life, I devoured every word. My heart told me it was the very way I needed, and there on that bed of languishing, after many a conflict with doubt o ,            .  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7402-00000049"/> 96      Roy's S earch. and fear and an evil nature, I gave my heart to the Saviour. "Then for the first time in my life the world looked bright to me,--my resentments were lost in love, and a peace that seemed like the dawning of heaven made the bed of weakness no trial to my patience. Months passed and I was able to sit up,-a poor disabled invalid. My constitution had received a fearful shock, and the physician gave little hope that I would ever be able to do alything. My old,  trial again returned,-not as before, for I had learned on whom to cast my burdens. Still the prospect that I might be always depend- ant as I had been, filled me with sorrow. While I was thus confined my cousins were at school, and to comfort me my uncle promised that when I was able I should go too. It seemed as if that happy day would never come; but it did, and one morning I entered   ]Miss Gray's Story.    97 school. I will pass briefly over my life when there, which was short, as my uncle took me out when I was fourteen. Aunt's health had failed, and she needed me to wait on her. Her own daughters did not like to stay in a sick-room, neither did she wish them to, saying,' it was no place for young girls.' This was a heavy blow to my hopes, as I had secretly set my heart on fitting myself to teach. Now I despaired of ever getting an educa- tion. "' I know it is a hard case, child,' replied my good nurse, when I told her of it, 'but the Lord has been good to incline your uncle to send you so long.' "' Perhaps the Lord does not see that it is best that I should have an educ/ation,' I said, despondingly.

"With fresh courage I returned to my tasks. There were broken moments each day that I had to myself, and these I improved to the utmost.  But it was slow, plodding work, and many a time I should have given up had it not been for a secret power coming, I -fervently believe, in answer to the prayers of my nurse, and my own faltering petitions, which nerved me afresh for the struggle. The years passed slowly. My cousins graduated 'honorably' at fashionable boarding-schools, and made their appearance in society, and still I was tugging away alone and unaided at my books. They looked upon me with lofty contempt, seldom deigning to speak, except when they wanted some favor. But the time came at last when I felt that I was prepared for a self-sustaining and useful life; and   Maiss Gray's Story.     99 one evening, as we rose from the table, I said: "' I would like to have a few moments con- versation with you, uncle, if convenient.'

Her heart was lightenied by the thought that others had had trials as well as herself and not been crushed by tler. But this was not all;-the seed of religious truth which Miss Gray had sown, soon quickened into harvest, for sorrow had taught her the need of the Divine helps which her teacher presented. Longing, as she was, for some one to lean upon, it was welcome news that there was a Great Burden-Bearer on whom she might freely cast all her care, know- ing that He cared for her. She was overjoyed   The Face at the kWindow.   103 to hear that she had aFather in Heaven, who, when His children asked bread, would not give them a stone; and who is more ready to grant the blessings pof His grace to those who seek for them, than earthly parents are to give good gifts unto their children; and, almost without a struggle, she turned to Him in unquestioning trust. "Unto  the poor the Gospel had been preached," and it was joyful tidings in- deed. This reception of the great fact of God's love to her through Jesus Christ, awakened her intellect and melted her her ar. She seemed to see things with new eyes, and hear the gentle voice of Jesus saying to her awakened con- science, "Daughter, be of good cheer; though t-hou passest through the waters, they shall not overflow thee; or through the fire, it shall not consume thee; for I will be with thee; and strengthen thee!"Thus readily, oftentimes, do  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7402-00000053"/> I04      Roy's Search. the poor of this world become rich in faith and heirs to the kingdom. One day, as Martha was walking the street, lost in thought, suddenly her heart was filled. with happiness. She lifted up-her eyes under the inspiration of her new joy, and it seemed to her as if the whole face of nature had been instantly enveloped in the robe of God's glory, as if the mountains and the hills were ready to "reak forth into singing, and -all the trees of the field to clap their hands." A scene of beauty indeed met the natural eye, which God's love in her heart and the inbreathing of the Holy Spirit vivified and heightened as with heavenly lustre. The golden sun was reflected from the spires and windows of the neighbor- ing city, and lighted up the hills and vales of the landscape, while over all hung the gorgeous cloud-drapery of the sky. IMartha stood for a moment transfixed. "Thy father's works!"   The Face at the WTindow.    jo5 she said, with kindling rapture, while thoughts of His wisdom, power, and greatness, rolled in upon her soul.  "Yet he loves me-even me- the drunkard's daughter! Yes, I feel it," she added, in the confidence of that peace which passeth understanding,( "and I may ask Hi-m what I will, and if it is best for me, He will grant it. Oh that He would save my father, and bless us as a family!"She knew that God worked by means, and she felt she had a mission before her, for those she loved; and resolved to study, and pray, and labor faith- fully for their good. But wlat a scene met her eyes as she en- tered the house! Five-year-old Lucy was crying with hunger, and Johnmie, eight years old, was trying to pacify her. The bare floor, battered walls, scant furniture, and broken windows, bespoke poverty and ruin; while the closet door, swinging on its one remaining  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7402-00000054"/> 106     Roy's Searcih. a   hinge seemed to mock her with its empty shelves. The wretchedness of her lot was forced upon her as never before. What a blot the drunkard's home now appeared on the fair works of God! "Lucy is dreadful hungry, and cries all the time," said Johnnie, "and she don't stop, though I tell her it don't do no good!" "Lucy, darling, be quiet," said Martha, kiss- ing the little pinched face, " and I'll try to get you some supper." She sent Johnnie into the streets to gather chips, and finding some potatoes in the cellar, washed them, and soon there was a fire crack- ling in the old stove, and the water was boil- ing. "What a dirty room!" ejaculated the girl, unconsciously, for the outward filth jarred against the purity within. "I must do some- thing to make it cleaner."   The1 Face at the TlVistdow  .

She was tring to set the broken limb of a chair, when the twins Willie and George sprang into the room. "Hello, Mattie, anything in the house for a fellar to eat?" cried Willie, in his boisterous way. "The table will be set as soon as two young gentlemen of my acquaintance have their hair conbed and faces washed." The boys stared in amazement at their sister. "Say, what's come over Mattie?" cried Willie, following his brother to a sink in the shed.  "Why, she's a little pleasanter, that' s all; , answered George, in his deliberate manner, "I guess the teacher gave her a talking to, for she had to stop after school." &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7402-00000055"/> l06     Roy's Sea rchz. "I wish she'd always be so. How this  comb hurts-if it don't make a fellow's eyes water!"The latter remark having reference to the remains of a comb with which he was tugging at his tangled locks. "Supper's ready!" called Martha's loving voice from the back door. The table was bare, the dishes old and cracked, and the po- tatoes and salt scanty fare, but Martha eat  with unusual relish. As for the boys they were very silent for them ;-something in Mar- . tha's thoughtful face, a new light beaning in her eyes, subdued them. They 'were younger than their sister, and that, combined with her  mature way, made them look up to hler. They wondered why she was so silent.

"I'd as lief stay as go," said George, slowly, and the two seated themselves on the door- step. In a few moments Martha sat down be- side them, and with Lucy in her lap, and Johnnie at her feet, told them Miss Gray's story, and described as well as she could her own feelings afterwards. "Now, children," she said, when she had ended, "I want our family to be happier and better every way; and I want you to help me, won't you? Perhaps when dear mother gets well, and she comes back from the asylum, she will find things so different that she will not be made ill again.' "What can we do?" asked George, who was slow to get a new idea. "Do!" exclaimed Willie. "Can't you see?   &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7402-00000056"/> IIo     Roy's. Sea rc. If we've a mind to we can do lots. We can have a garden, lIattie." "I wonder I did not think of that," she an- swered, approvingly. ;-   "We'll tinker up the old fence to-night," continued Willie, with a glowing face. "Well, if you two will attend to the out- door affairs, I'll do my best in the house," said Martha. "Who knows but poor father may make a new start when lie sees us trying?" "I wish lhe would," observed George, gloom- ily.  "It's dreadful to be a drunkard's boy. There's nobody in this place so low down as wre!" "So much the better, if we climb up," an- I swered Martha, cheerily. "Let's go over the  grounds and see whlat can be done." So the five started on a tour of inspection and consultation.

Back of the house was a small barn, elmpty and desolate; the clap- boards were peeling off, the door swung groan- ing on. its wrenched hinges, and the flooring had been torn up for firewood. Not a stray fowl was to be seen, -everything had been sold for drink, or allowed to drop into decay. "If we could only have dear old Mooly again," said Johnnie, whose anxious little face  had been noting everything, " and the hens- oh dear!" the tears beginning to fall. "Oh, we can earn them-there's plenty of ways!" replied Willie, but with a tremulous voice. But it was growing dark, and they had nothing to work With, so they came back to the door-step again.

"What is it?" cried the children, together. "I am going to hire farmer McDonald to plough up the garden." "You hasn't dot any money," chimed in Lucy, wisely. "You can't do it," said George. "Can't I?" rejoined Willie. "Nothing like trying, old gent!" and suiting the action to the word, he was off in a moment. The far- mer's house was but a short distance. .He was milking when the lad approached. "Shall you want any one to help you this summer?" asked Willie, commencing the subject at once. "Wal, yes," said the old man, regarding him thoughtfully. "Think I shhll." Then, seeing Willie hesitate, he added encouragingly, "Do you want work?"   The Face at the Wilndfow.    II3 "Yes, sir: and I thiought perhaps you'd let your man plough up our garden, when he has his team, if I'd pay in work." Mr. McDonald put down hiss pail, and looked up at the boy inquiringly.

Meanwhile the children on the door-step were busy discussing plans for the future. Suddenly the still evening air was broken by fierce and riotous shouting. Martha turned pale,--was it her father with some of his boon companions? The voices came nearer, and soon a little negro girl appeared, followed by a troop of rough boys and young men, who were pelting her with mud and stones. The child, with a comic mixture of fear and defiance on her ebon face, seemed eagerly looking out for a place of refuge.   "'Come right in here!" cried Martha, going to the street. Without waiting for a second bidding the child glided through the gate, and followed Martha into the house. So quickly was this done that the boys had not noticed her escape, but rushed by. the house in pursuit of the fugitive.   The Face at thje Window.

The child speedily made herself contented, and even little Lucy, who was at first afraid of her, was won by the frank at-home manner of the dark-skinned wayfarer.

She had nothing to fear fron Willie, however, as she soon found, and the little group, accompanied by the stranger, entered the kitchen, gathered around the well-burnt stove, into which a handful of chips were charily dropped now and then, for the double purpose of warmth and light,--to discuss the grave questions thrust prematurely on their gminds,-a child's Committee of Ways and Aleans, in patched, ill- fitting garments, without salary, almost with- out food, how eagerly and gravely they con- sulted together.

A ruddy beam from the stove lay directly across this vision of horror, re- vealing its hideousness at the first glance. For with an unearthly yell at them through the windowV-a screech that almost froze the blood in their veins-that image of fear sped on. Martha saw that it was her father, crazed by drink; and as his quick unsteady step died away in the distance, she felt relieved that his maniacal frenzy impelled him to pass along and not come in to waste and destroy. The-children sat in almost breathless silence for some moments, not a solunld being heard in the desolate room. Their fright was too great for expression. At length Miarthla burst into a heart-broken fit of weeping, lher slight frame convulsed with the great sobs that could not  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7402-00000060"/> I 8      Roy's Sea rce. ----o-o e oH.--- be suppressed. Then growing calmer, shle looked pityingly around upon the rest, and said, clasping her hands agonizedly: "Oh,1 children, what can we do without God's help? Do you not see that though we mend the fences, plant the garden, and earn money for bread, still it is all as nothing, and may be in vain, unless father will give up strong drink? And 'who can incline him to but God? If He gives himn a new heart he will do it; but, I fear, not till then. Let us all pray that God will have mercy on us, and save dear father, and make dear mother well." And kneeling down, in broken words she cried to the Father of the fatherless for help.

But she could not, and lay thinking over the events of the past day. '"You thought you met with a great change yesterday, and was very happy, but you do not feel so happy now; you see you were de- ceived," a voice seemed to whisper in her ear, and Martha sat up in bed affrighted, and gazed ' ("S)  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7402-00000061"/> 120     Roy's Search. about as if expecting to see the speaker. Poor child! she did not know that it was the hiss of the Tempter; and seeing no one, nestled down. in her wretched bed again, saying, "It is true, I do not feel so happy now;" and bereft of hope, burst into tears. A great darkness now came upon her--very great in contrast with the wondrous light that had filled her with un- speakable joy. That conflict with opposing principalities and powers which so often sur- prises the rejoicing convert, was upon her, and knowing not its significance, she was at once overwhelmed. She did not understand that her peace came by looking away from herself to Christ, and that to look away from Him to herself again, was to turn from Calvary to Sinai-and that this was one of the choicest stratagems of Satan with which many a child of God has been ensnared. Oh, had she but one to counsel her then-a Christian mother,   The Drunkard's H1ome.    121  brother, or sister--but who could help her in her conflict in that home, cursed and heathenizeld by the fearful demon Intem- perance?

Was it her angel that whispered, "But was it not by prayer that, your change came-just as your teacher told you it would?" "So it was," responded 3Iartha; "strange that I should have forgotten it." And lifting up her heart to God in child-like trust, she was at peace again. The day was just break- ing, so she stepped to the attic stairs, and called the boys, then returned to her own room, and hastened to dress, that she might commence the morning's work. But Martha's voice awoke the little negro girl in the room below.  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7402-00000062"/> 122     Roy's Search. "'Spect I better be gwine," said she to her- self, as she rubbed open her eyes. The cupboard door stood open, and stepping to it she peered within with an anxious look. "Nuffin dar-not a crumb!

"But where's the little black girl?" she added, as she saw that her guest's corner was unoccupied. She went to the door and gazed up and down the street; then thinking she might be in the barn, loolied in there; but the colored child was nowhere to be seen. Re-entering the kitchen, the pan on the table and its load of cold meat, pieces of white and brown bread, and bits of pastry, met her eye. She comprehended the case at once, and exclaimed, tears filling her eyes: "Whowouldl have thoughllt that our morn- ing's meal would be brought to us in such a way!"

"Many hands make light work," and the youngest were washed and dressed, breakfast eaten and morning chores done by eight o'clock. "Mr. lMcDonald says he will plough the garden to-day!" cried Willie, running in quite out of breath. "But what shall we do for seed?" asked Martha. "Oh, that's all fixed," answered Willie, his face aglow, " he's going to let us have all .the kinds we want, and I pay in work!" "Oh, Willie," said Martha, " you are plan- ning to do too much.

On her way to school, Martha overtook Jane Andrews, the daughter of the village rumseller. Martha's feelings had often been hurt by this girl, and dreading to be seen by her, she walked as slowly as possible. Jane, however, who was prinking and twist- ing, to look at her immense trail, caught sight of Martha, and with a curl of the lip gathered up her rich dress, and crossed the street. Martha felt the implied insult, and with burn- ing cheeks walked quickly on. lShe hoped to reach school first and go to her desk, witlh- out again meeting the rude girl, but when she  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7402-00000064"/> 126     Roy's Search. arrived at the school-house, Jane was already there. "There's Williams' eldest!" she said, in a loud tone, to some of her companions. "Do notice her elegant dress, and her Paris boots! How is your father this morning, my dear? I heard his melodious voice last night, sere- nading the inhabitants of Maplewood!" The tone and manner stung Martha more than the words. "Who is it that made him so?" came flash- ing through her heart; " who is it that takes the last cent from the poor man, that his own family may roll in wealth? I would rather be a drunkard's daughter than the child of the heartless rumseller. No! no!

"How hard to be a Christian!" thought Martha; " what angry passions arose in my heart when Jane spoke to me. How can I expect poor father to govern his appetite for strong drink when I find it so difficult to govern my temper?"And with her head on her desk, she gave herself up to sad, self-accus- ing thoughts. But in upon the tempest within, came the words of the morning psalm, in Miss Gray's clear, steady voice. "Bow down thine ear, O Lord, hear me; for I am poor and needy." Martha listened, eagerly drinking in every word; gradually the mist in her soul cleared away, and when the school repeated ,tle  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7402-00000065"/> -I8     Roy's Search. Lord's prayer, she could join in the petition, "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us."  Under the new feeling Martha calmly ap- plied herself to her lessons, and although she caught a scornful look from her enemy, it glanced off from the armor of God's love in which her heart was enveloped, leaving it un- scathed. She was even sorry, when in the spelling-class Jane failed, and she was placed above her. In this happy frame of mind the day passed, and with the satisfaction of knowing that she had been perfect in every lesson, Martha started for home. Miss Gray had been so occupied with com- pany, that Martha did not have a chance for conversation with her, but the pleasant smile she received as she was leaving the school- room, almost made up for it, the girl thoughlt.

Ah! she knew too well her father's loud rough tones and fearful oaths. Suddenly the terrified shriek of a child rose above the din. Her father was whipping little Lucy,-she could hear the blows as they fell with a dull heavy sound,--what should she do? If she left the child in his hands he might kill her. Wilhe was at work in Mr. McDonald's field. She ran around the house, and snatching an old horn, blew it witl all her might. The boy turned and Miartha beckoned to him. Before he had reached the house, by his sister's pale face, and the uproar within, he knew all. "Oh, Mattie, what shall we do?" he asked, anxiously. "We must run in, and snatch her away!" "Come then," said Willie, and Martha 9  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7402-00000066"/> 130     Roy's Searcz. never forgot the look of bravery on his white, resolute face. So, followed by Martha, he walked directly in, and up to his father. "What's the trouble?" he asked, at the same time pulling Lucy away. "Run and hide!" said Martha, and the child sprang out of the open door. Maddened at what he considered an inter- ference with his authority, the excited father sprang at his son, and struck him a fearful blow on the head with his clenched fist. The lad sank to the floor as if dead, and Martltha screaming, threw herself beside him almost as helpless as he. The frenzied inebriate was somewhat so- bered by the result of his brutality, and sank sullenly into a chair.

I might ask Mrs. Hill to step in?" "Yes,yes!" cried the unhappy father, who sat withi his eyes fixed on the death-like face of his pet boy. The few moments before Martha returned seemed ages to the remorse- ful parent. All the events of his life came up before him, a checquered account of good and , evil, and the poor slave of his own appetite groaned as he thought it all over. Mrs. Hill was a near neighbor; her kind, grandmotherly heart had often been touched by the downfall of the father, whom she well -knew had seen better days.

Wilhe had often run on errands for her, and his briyght impulsive ways had won him quite a place in the old lady's affections. "The dear boy!" she exclaimed, the tears gathering at the sad story, "I'll run right over and see him!" and in a moment she was by Willie's side. Mr. Williams did not turn or speak when M{rs.

The group around the bed hung breathlessly on his decision. "How happened this?" he asked, abruptly. There was a dead silence for a moment. How could Martha tell the awful facts? The lad has been seriously hurt," said the physician, his eye resting on the bent figure of the father. "Yes, yes, he was hurt by the hand   of his drunken father!" said  Ir.

"Good nursing may bring him through,' answered the physician, doubtfully, "but the symptoms are bad. Kilby's wife is down again, and they asked me if you could be had?" "Not until the child is out of danger," said Mrs. Hill. "Just like you," returned the doctor, warmly, as he moved towards the door, " and the boy is not the only patient that needs wise nursing," and he glanced at the wretched father. "It would be a happy day could he be himself again!" and the physician started for his chaise, and then came back. "Here's a prescription for the family," thlrusting a bank bill into her hand. "Use it as you find it necessary;" and springing into his carriage, the good Samaritan was out of sight.   Th/e Drunkard's Hoame.    135 Ifrs. Hill went back to the sitting-room, and drawing fMart-ha out, told her what the doctor had said about Willie. "After he is comfortably fixed, I shall make your father some strong coffee, and get him a nice supper. Perhaps that will take away the thirst for drink." "Oh, how I wish Willie's sickness would mnake father reform, said Martha; "' you don't know what a noble man he once was." In a -short time Wilhe was established in a comfortable bed, a bright fire was burning in the kitchen, the tea-kettle was singing merrily, and the delicious aroma of the coffee pervaded the room. Mrs. Hill, beaming and motherly, was cooking- an oyster stew, and Martha alternating between the kitchen and sick- room, when George burst in, and going to his brother's bed-side, asked with a frightened look: ':  ;  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7402-00000069"/> 136     Roy's Search.

As Mrs. H{ill could not persuade the father to leave lhis melancholy watch, she brought him some strong coffee, which he drank mechanically. "But," said Martlha, as they were seating themselves at the table, " where's Lucy?" "Sure enough, where can she be?" ex- claimed Mrs. Hill, as they all started up in alafrm. Martha had not seen her since the dreadful affair of the afternoon, and wondered that she could have forgotten her so long. They searched the house, the barll, and the garden, calling "Lucy!

The neighbors were questioned, but no one had seen her, and no trace had' been found of the child, when, long after   ThIe Druznkard's Home.    .37 midnight, the wretched family gathered to- gether, with the exception of the father, who made lis appearance the next morning, wet and weary from his long, unhappy search. It was indeed a sad night; dear little Lucy gone, Willie hot and feverish, starting up to shout deliriously, as he seemed to live over the tragic events of the afternoon, "Don't strike her, father!"

Roy had spent the afternoon after --e his arrival in Boston, walking around the city, amused and interested by the bustling busy scene about him, and the tempting shop windows, without a thought of business in his curly pate, when the above met his eye. "Just the thing!" he exclaimed, stopping short before the sign, "I expect I am a single gentleman, unless they count you in, old fellow," he said to Carlo. Carlo looked as if he could answer the question, but as he did not, Roy went on: (138)   Bob the Boot-black.   139 "I think we'll go in and see, any how." He went up a pair of stairs, and knocked at the first door. It was opened by a tall, thin woman, with dress so scant that she seemed to Roy to be the tallest person he ever saw. "What -do you want?" she asked, curtly. "I want a boarding-place," said Roy. "Mr. Grimes, here's a boy wants you to board him!" called the lean woman. "Bring him in," was the reply, and Roy found himself in the presence of Mfr. Grimes. "So you want me to board you?" said the man, removing a pipe from his nouftlh. Roy explained that he had just come to the city and was looking for work. "Looking for work! Well, if I undertake to board you, how do I know H shall have my pay? Got any money?" "O yes," answered loy, promptly.

Bos- ton people has been imposed upon by you country chaps more'n once, and they fights shy of ye; but as you say you'll pay, and you seem to be honest, I'll take ye." Roy ventured to ask what the price would be. "Oh, I shan't charge ye much, my rule is for boarders to deposit five dollars in advance ;" and Mr. Grimes seated himself at a desk, in a business way, and taking out a greasy account book, asked Roy's name and entered it, Roy depositing with him the required sum.

"Supper bell 'll ring in an hour," said the woman, "you can come into the sitting-room when you like." A box of a room it was, the dirty single bed and unpainted washstand, with the one dis- located chair, would have appeared anything but inviting to Roy's eyes if he had been brought up in luxury. "As snug a a bug in a rug," quoted he, seat- ing himself on the creaking chair, and looking out to view the prospect, which, as is often  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7402-00000072"/> "2     Roy's Searchi. the case in Boston, was extensive enough- skyward. Roy felt like a gentleman of leisure; he had so much money, and devoted his time to no- ticing the ladies he met on the crowded side- walk, to see if any one of them resembled the likeness of his mother, and amused limnself with the city sights. "I can live for quite a while without earn- ing," he thought, "and if before my money is all spent I should happen to find her, there would be no need of business. She would take care of me. And there's so many people in Boston it's -more than likely she's here." He peeped into every passing carriage in hopes of seeing her longed-for face, and when- ever the door of a private dwelling opened, if a lady stepped out he drew near for a careful scrutiny. He speculated much as to what sort of a dwelling she might occupy, and his hopes   Bob the Boot-black.    143 rising with his search for her, lie passed and re-passed whole blocks, reading the names on the door-plates, and lingering to catch a view through the windows of the occupants. The lad soon came imperceptibly to frame a theo- ry on the subject, and thought he could pick out the class of houses she would be sure to reside in. The low tenement houses lhe pass- ed without a thought. Such a face as hers he was certain would not be seen in them. The next grade was scarcely up to the standard he had set up, measured by his judgment of her looks and worth,--the homes of the wealthy only met his expectations, and up and down the aristocratic portions of the city he paced, expecting each moment her form to appear, till weary and disappointed he strolled care- lessly along, anxious only for a resting-place. Boston Common, with its clean and gravelled walks, shaded by noble trees, and its pond and  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7402-00000073"/> i44     Roy's Search.  fountain, the Public Garden with its flower- bordered paths, and swans sailing in the mimic lake, were to him a fairy scene. He frolicked with Carlo, brought crumbs for the swans. No wonder that our hero, being mortal, and disposed to forget his duty, like some who are older, gave himself up to the fascination, and enjoyed himself to the utmost. "I'll begin to-morrow," he would say, when a thought of business came into his head. "I worked hard at Farmer Sprague's and I want a little rest now; it won't take long to get something to do in this big city, where every- body seems busy." Money being plenty, he indulged himself now and then. A new top, a pound or so of candy, and a patent fish-hook.

A heap of bits and ends that boys delight in was beside him, and he was so absorbed in his efforts to free the lining from the hook, when a big boy sauntered along. "Hello, youngster, what you about?" Boy looked up and said: "I wanted to fish a little, but I cannot get this hook out!" The boy stared a moment, and then burst into loud laughlter. "You're mighty green! Don't you know the police would nab you as quick as lightning? Why, the city of Boston owns these fish!" Roy was much scared at this, and he put his things back into his pocket in short time; but not before he was surrounded by a crowd of boys, who seemed to appreciate the joke, and Roy slunk off the common, mortified. ' "Never minid, old fellow," said he, to Carlo, recovering himself, "it "wasn't so big a thing to 10  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7402-00000074"/> "6     Roy's Search. make a fuss about; I guess if they knew we were all alone, taking care of ourselves, they wouldn't call us green!" Whereupon he consoled himself with a large velvety peach, for which he paid a fabulous price. One morning, as Roy was coming clown stairs, whistling, with Carlo following like a shadow, he met his landlord. "I want my pay, to-day!" he said, gruffly.. The boy opened his eyes in astonishment. "I thought I paid you," he replied. "Thought, or not," said M3r. Grimes, "I must have my money now." "I gave you five dollars, and I thought as you said you shouldn't charge much, that would be enough for a good while," answered Poy. "I know nothing about your five dollars," replied the man, "and if you don't hand over   Bob the Boot-black.     I47 the money you'll find your board hereafter in the lobby!" Roy was utterly confounded at the turn of afftairs, but suddenly he brightened up, and said: "You have forgotten, sir, I did pay you, and your wife was there; if you'll please ask her she'll remember it." And as if to corroborate his statement, Mrs. Grimes appeared. ":Kate, did this boy pay me five dollars?" demanded the landlord. "No," said she, curtly, and passed on. The death-knell to the boy's rising hopes was sounded- in that short negative. What could he do? "Come, hand   over the money!" persisted the man, " six dollars for yourself and dog." Roy pulled out his purse, blut all it contain- ed was two dollars and fifty cents.  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7402-00000075"/> "8     Roy's Scarch. --.-- .o( 0 "That's all I have," he replied, mournfully.

Roy rushed up to his room, and throwing himself on the bed burst into tears. His brief season of pleasure had suddenly terminated, and without a cent he had been turned out of doors. Where should he go? Carlo, who had been a silent, but observant witness of what was going on, now essayed to comfort him, and springing on the bed rubbed his cold nose in his little master's neck. "You blessed old fellow!" cried Roy, throw- ing his arms around him, "you don't know. I'm moneyless and homeless, do you?" Carlo barked, and thrust his nose into his   Bob the Boot-black.     149 master's neck and face 'again. The tickling sensation made Boy laugh, and a regular game ensued; Carlo cut up so many antics in delight, that Roy laughed until every trace of tears was gone. The transition from the depth of misery to the height of mirthfulness, how nat- ural to children! Had Mr. Grimes  seen the picture curly- headed Roy and Carlo made in their fun, he would have been astonished, to say the least. Luckily there was no one within hearing at the time. The frolic subsided in a moment, and the lad, with flushed cheeks and bright eyes, seated himself to plan for the future. "Stop that, sir!" he said, shaking his head at Carlo, who was on the qid vive for more fun, "we must not play any more now, we've got to go to work!" Roy began to gather his little possessions to- gether.  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7402-00000076"/> 15o     Roy's Search. -.---o-IXoo---- "We must leave this cunming room," he said, talking to Carlo, whom he had come to treat as a companion; "where we shall sleep to-night I don't know." He fastened his mother's carpet-bag, and giving a last glance at the room where he had spent a few peaceful days, went slowly down the stairs. He stopped at the door of the apartment where Mr. Grimes usually was. "I am going now," he said. "Spose I never shall see ye or the money you owe me!" growled the landlord. "Mr. Grimes," returned Roy, looking him steadily in the eye, "I don't think I owe you anything. I don't understand it, however, and shall pay you the rest; but if you have cheated me, it'll be the worse for you!" And before the guilty man could recover from his astonishment, Roy and Carlo were in the street.   Bob thie Boot-black.    i5  The two friends were now fairly started in search of business. Roy meant to try every place he came to, and acting on this principle le entered a large hardware store. "Lots to be done here," thought he. "Do you want a boy?" he asked of ia brisk looking person behind the counter. "Yes, I want a boy," said the man, giving him a quick glance, and then diving into his ledger again, " but you're too small for me." "If you please, sir," answered Roy, "I'm stronger than I look; I've worked on a farm, and "- "You won't suit my purpose," interrupted the mlan impatiently. Roy went out, his hopes slighlltly dampened. Another store was tried, but with no better success, another and another, until he had traversed half of Washington street.

The day wore away. The two friends were unmistakably hungry, having eaten nothing since breakfast. The smell of the savory din- ners in the eating-houses hacl an attraction quite irresistible to Roy, to say nothng of Carlo, who sniffed as if even that was worth something. For the first time Roy had gone without his noonday meal. The neighboring clock struck five as the two, dispirited and discouraged, turned into the passage leading from Brattle street to Cornhill. On the steps which led up to Cornhill stood a boy about Roy's age, the oddity of whose attire arrested our hero's attention. His pants, which must originally have belonged to a man, were rolled up above the former knees; he wore a coat which corresponded, the tails of   Bob the Boot-black.    153 ----oooo---- whichh calme to his heels. He had just picked up his hat as Roy came along, and was about to put it upon his head, when something black sprang like lightning and fastened itself upon his closely shorn head. Before Roy could make out what sort of a creature it was, Carlo sprang forward barking his loudest, and then Roy saw that it was a cat! The boy was screaming as the vicious creature tore at his hair and face with teeth and claws. It was a terrible sight, but Roy was not swanting in courage. He rushedt at the animal, and he did not know scarcely how, but by the united efforts of himself and Carlo, the cat was driven off, and the lad stood weep- ing bitterly, covered with blood. By this time quite a crowd had gathered, the burly form of a police officer among them.

"It's too bad," said he warmly, " you ought to put some water right on it,--nothing bet- ter!" The boy made no reply, but kept his hands to his head. "Don't you know where you can get some?" asked Roy. "Over there." "How do you feel now?" asked Roy, after hle had assisted him in bathing his bleeding head. "A big sight better!" answered the boy, winking back the tears. "Perhaps your mother would bind up your head if you should go home," suggested Roy. "No, she wouldn't," was the answer. "Why not?" "'Cause I haint got no mother!"   Bob the Boot-black.    i55 "Why that's just like me!" said Roy, with a sigh., "I hav'n't any father either!" continued his new acquaintance. "Neither have I, that is, that I ever saw," rejoined Roy. "But I guess I'm worse off than you, for I hav'n't even a place to live in now." "You haint!" exclaimed the boy. "You're fooling me!" "No, honor bright," said Roy. "I'll .tell you all about it." And seating themselves on the curb-stone, Roy, in a few well-chosen words, related his sad story. "Well, but it's too bad!" cried his new ac- quaintance. "Anybody   'ud tfhink I  was worser off nor you, but I haint, I've got work, and there's plenty of it if yer spry and fights shy of the big uns, and I has a good place to sleep in."  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7402-00000079"/> 156     Roy's Search. "What do you do?" asked Roy, eagerly. "Blacks boots; an' I'd like to see anybody shine 'em up better nor Bob can!" straighten- ing himself up. "How much can you earn?" "Some days I makes eighty cents," an- swered Bob. "You do!" cried Eoy, regarding the queer figure of his new acquaintance with much in- terest; "do you suppose I could earn as mulch?" Bob thrust his dirty hands into the mouths of his pants' pockets, and cocking his head-- still dripping from the effects of the water-on one side, regarding him critically. "You'd make a jolly boot-black. That is," he added, "if you've got the brass; if you haint,-the rest on 'erm 'ud cut you out 'as flat as a flounder!" "The 'rest of' who?" asked Roy.   Bob the Boot-black.    i57 "The boot-blacks;" answered Bob, "why, there's more of 'em in this here city of Boston nor you could count in a day. It's full of 'em. We has to step round lively. You just come 'long till I shows my 'stablishment." And frolm under the eaves of a building not far from the corner where the cat made her raid, Bob drew out his establishment, consist- ing of a rough oblong box, two blacking I brushes, a piece of old carpeting to kneel on, and a box of blacking. "This 'ere's my 'place o' business;'" said Bob, presenting it with a flourish, "patient puts his foot here, yer see, an' I doctors it, and pockets the tin!"

The evening shadows were falling, the street lamps were already glimmering like so many earth-stars-what else could Roy do? He thankfully accepted Bob's offer, feeling more- over a deep interest in the odd little boot- black. "First thing on the ticket's supper," ob- served Bob, as the three, Bob, Roy and Carlo, started off. "I can't get any, for I hav'n't a cent of mo- ney," remarked Roy; "besides 'I aint hungry -not much, I mean." "Well, I don't swally that!" cried Bob, stop- ping short and facing him; " didn't you get that critter off my head?" Roy nodded. "Well, it's my turn to help you : you're under my pertection now, 'an I wants yer to come square up to the mark, 'an when yer hungry, say so;" and having said this, he placed his   Bob th e Boot-black.

Roy remonstrated, but the little boot- black was in great glee.

"Theatre!" repeated Roy, " what's that?" "Why, don't you know?" replied Bob, in a commiserating tone, "haint you never been there?" Our hero was obliged to confess ignorance, making his short residence in the city an apology. "Well, you'll never say that after to-night," answered Bob; "it's the jolliest place you never did see! They has the most splendifer- ous things, gentlemen and ladies dressed up grand, with flowers and jewelry, and they act things right out. Maggie Mitchell's the one for me. If I was a man I'll marry her!" Roy ventured to inquire who Maggie Mitch- ell was. "She's a straddlegedian--some folks calls her, and a star reformer!" answered Bob; "she's going to reform to-night. Just you wait!"   Bob the Boot-black.    I6i ----  .OOc---- Roy's curiosity was greatly excited, and he was anxious to go. The crowd of boys and roughs, however, quite frightened him, and he kept close to his companion, who seemed ac- customed to the scelle. But he was surprised to find ladies waiting among the jeering, jost- ling, swearing throng. The rush was terrible when the doors were opened, and Roy had to maneuvre skilfully to avoid being trodden under foot or crushed in the pressure. "I'm squeezed up awful!" he whispered to Bob. "Oh, that's nothin' after you get used to it," answered Bob, patronizingly. "Keep hold on my coat." Bob piloted him to a place in one of the gal- leries, Roy following, utterly dazzled by the glare of the lights and dizzy with the height.

Boys ragged and squalid, men Nvith brandy blossoms on nose and cheek, and watery eyes, and coarse, brazen-faced women, seemed even to Roy's inexperienced eyes to constitute a rough-looking audience. Here and'there might be seen a person who looked respectable, but for the most part the scum of society was there. The conversation, snatches of which he overheard, shocked the boy's pure ears, and the free use of oaths pained hm. A doubt of the place began to dawn in his mind. "Would my mother like to see me here?" he asked himself, " would she come here?" "No," was the prompt answer. The very idea of the pure face pictured in the ambrotype beside those simpering, painted, trinketed wo- men, seemed sacrilege. The rising of the great curtain that hid the, stage, interrupted his meditations. He listen-   Bob the Boot-black.    i63 ed with breathless interest to the conversation of the actors, but the famous Maggie did not come up to his expectations. "How dreadful silly for a big woman to be- have so!" he thought; and when the crowning feat of her performance was accomplished, and the glorious Maggie, dressed as a boy, tried to personate one, he was disgusted. "I'd as lief see Mr. Sprague's old Pinky play calf!" he said to himself. Roy was glad when the mockery was over, and Bob and he were out of the hot, poisonous atmosphere. He'refrained, howaver, from ex- pressing his opinion to Bob. A corner of an attic was the place to which Bob brought him, and a heap of straw in tile corner was his couch.

POOR little Lucy was wild after her fa- ther's brutal attack. Timid, sensitive, and delicate, her father had never be- fore raised his hand against her. In his roughest moods he would caress his "birdie," as he called her, and the horrible scene burst upon her with a savage fury that almost broke her baby heart. When liberated by Willie, she fled from the house, in search of a hiding place. Through the newly plowed garden, across the field beyond, she struggled, as if in some terrible nightmare, expecting every mo- ment to hear her father's footsteps behind. From the pasture she emerged into a grazy (165) r   &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7402-00000084"/> I66     Roy's Search. road which led far into the country. For a long time the frightened child hurried on until she dropped to the ground from weariness. The road was bounded on each side by thick woods which helped to deepen the gathering twmilight. "Lucy 'fiaid!" she cried, the loneliness of the place dawning upon her; and sobbing very softly, " so no wicked men would come and hurt her," she crept under a stunted pine and gazed fearfully about. Gradually the little one's sobs grew fainter, the white lids drooped over the blue eyes, and she was fast asleep. A few moments later, a wagon drove slowly towards her. It was the property of two vil- lains in the guise of ragmen, and was filled with rags, old iron, bones, and some other things, hidden under the mass, which the two unscrupulous men had picked up or stolen. Their greedy eyes peering around, lighted   I The Little Wanderer.    167 upon the pretty picture of Lucy as she lay on the green sward. "The very ticket!" cried the older, a man with a deep red scar across his dark wrinkled face. "What are you going to do?" asked the second. "I warrant you wont find much that is valuable on her." "That last dram made you stupid," returned the other. "Don't you know old 'Gripps wants a child to go with his organ? She's the ticket, I tell you! As pretty a specimen as I ever laid eyes on! Fix a place in the bot- tom of the wagon, will you?" In a moment the child was placed on some rags in the bottom of the wagon, oblivious of all that was passing. Her Capturers were bound for Boston, a few miles distant, having returned from a trip into the country.  &#xD;<pb n="168" xml:id="VAC7402-00000085"/> 168     Roy's Sea rch. When Lucy awoke, it was broad daylight* She was stiff with the cold taken in her mid- night ride, and would have cried, but the strange place she was in excited her curiosity. Rags, rags, rags, on every side, beneath, and all about, what could it all mean? And way over in the further corner of the room were piles of iron and copper. Just then a key turned in the great door opposite, and her captor of the night before entered. Lucy shrank back as she saw the ill-favored visage, and when he came forward and tried to talk with her, she burst into tears. "I want to go home! Mattie 'll want me," she sobbed. "Yes, you shall go home, chick," said the man, with a leer. "See, Mattie's sent you some breakfast ;" plunging a 'dirty hand into his pocket and taking out some buns.    &#xD;<pb n="Illustration-169" xml:id="VAC7402-00000086"/> \ "I) YO AN I',.:iM TO TAi YOiHMtER   iThe Little Wandercr.    169 Children are pretty quick at reading char- acter, and although she had a faint suspicion that Mattie did not send them, she eat the cakes, but would answer no questions the man put to her. The door opened again, and an old woman, sharp-featured and gaunt, entered. A significant look passed between the two, and retiring to a distant corner, they held a pro- longed consultation. Little Lucy was wise beyond her -years, and she watched the evil countenances of the two as if to gain some clue to what they were going to do with her. Presently the old crone came forward, and peering into her face, said, in a shrill voice: "Do you want grandma to take you home, dear?" "OO yes; take me home  to see- la'ttie and Willie." "Well, if sissy will be good a while, grand- ma 'll tlake her home."'  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7402-00000087"/> I70     Roy's Search. oo oo- Partly consoled by this, Lucy amused her- self through the forenoon watching the strange couple as they assorted the immense bundles of rags. The old woman pried restlessly into every corner; once she caught up something from under a pile of filth, and Lucy saw a long flashing slender chain. The man uttered a cry, and sprang forward to seize it. "You thief!" cried the woman, "did you think you could steal from me?" He muttered something about its not being hers. "Shut up!" shouted the crone. "I'm mistress of this place, and everybody and everything in it! Don't I pay ye to do my jobs? If I catches you trying to hide anything from me again, I'll put an end to it!" and the look that accompanied the words gave her face a more fiendish expression. About noon the old woman, taking Lucy by   Th e Little Wanderer.    171 the hand, led her towards her home. The rag- establishment was situated in a dark alley which formed a passage-way between two large streets. The crowds that surged to and fro almost took Lucy's breath away, and the grasp of the old woman grew tighter as she hurried her along through Commercial street at a swift pace. Her steps slackened when they entered North street, and the child had time to look about. It was noon, and the in- mates of the filthy abodes were sunning them- selves on door-step and sidewalk. Men old in every species of sin, drunkards, murderers, pickpockets, house-breakers, incendiaries, the very off-scouring of all nations, were to be seen. Women young in years, but old in crime, the once fair cheek pale and haggard, eyes weak and uncertain, sat in the windows, gazing at the passer-by.

The air was sickly with the poisonous breath and polluted dwellings of thousands of miserable beings. Poor Lucy grew faint and sick at the frightful sights and sounds, and the deathly atmosphere that sur- rounded her. "This isn't my Mattie's house," cried Lucy, "take me away!" "Pretty soon," said the woman, coaxingly, plunging as she spoke down some filthy stairs into a damp basement. A sound of music came from a far-off room, and in this direction the woman dragged the weary child. Lucy's eyes were becoming accustomed to the dim light, and she saw in the corner of a low apart- ment a rough, thick-set man, lazily turning the handle of a hand-organ. "Is that you, Sal?" he growled. "I declare   The Little Wanderer.     I73 I've waited quite long enough; can't start till to-morrow 11now, just waiting for you!" "Hush," she answered, pulling Lucy from behind ler, andtaking off a huge sun-bonnet *that hid her golden curls; "see what I've broughllt you, Gripps. Isn't she a beauty?" Lucy burst into tears at this, and clinging to the woman, begged in heart-breaking tones to " take her awayi from that bad man." Stop yer whvlimpering!" cried Gripps, in a voice of thunder. "I'm, yer master, now, and if you,- "Now what will you be joking for?" inter- rupted the crone, with a meaning look at Gripps. "Never mind him, sissy, he's going out your way to-morrow, and he'll take you right along!" The organ-grincer fell in with the idea, and going to the outer room, which formed a part, of one of those saloons so often seen in that  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7402-00000089"/> I 74     lRoy's Search. vicinity, returned with some pieces of candy, and seating her in a corner, left her to herself. Lucy was better pleased with this arrange- ment, and, after rolling all but one piece in a corner of her ragged apron, nibbled at that ' very carefully, so as to make it last a great while, child-fashion, her great eyes noting everything, meanwhile. The organ-grinder had gone into the outer room, and she could hear a low murnmur of voices through the closed door. The air was oppressively hot, and Lucy yielded to the drowsy feeling, and with the candy in her hand, fell asleep. Old Sally, having finished her confab with Gripps, peeped in a moment after, and mo- tioning Gripps from the saloon, the two softly entered. "That faco'll bring you heaps o' money!" said the woman, pointing her skinny finger at the sleeping chld, "and there wont be no   The Little WPanderer.     17 5 danger of your being caught, you are going so far." "Ohl, I'll pass myself off as her father; don't I look like it'?" "That you do!" laughed the woman, "she's the picture of you." The two stood gloating over the innocent beauty of the sleeping child, as a miser over the shining of the gold, as if no thought of fond friends at home, bewailing the loss of the household pet, entered their besotted minds. At last Lucy -was aroused by strange noises. here was a clicliing of glasses in the next room, mingled with oaths and wild laughter that sent a chill to the heart of the child. The room was dark, and it was some time before her young mind could comprehend whlere she was; then she trembllingly lay and listened, struggling to repress the frightened sobs that sprang to her lips, lest she should be heard.  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7402-00000090"/> 17G     Roy's Search.

"Oh, she's killing me!" screamed Bob, and c brandishing his arms he struck Roy full in the face. "Bob, Bob, wake up!" cried Roy, shaking him by the shoulder, but no impression did it seemn to m:alce on the lad.

Bob, however, heeded him not, but raved on. Roy lay trembling. He could see nothing, it was so dark, but, as he put his hand on the boy's shoulder, a large drop of rain dropped upon it, and he found- that Bob was quite wet. "Poor fellow!" murmured Roy, "he's sick, and lying in the rain. I'll change places with him." It was no small task to remove Bob, who rewarded his kind offices by vigorous punches,   Battle of the Blackers.  179 inviting him to "come on, if he wanted to fight!" ",Now if I could only bathe his head," thought Roy, who was no novice in the sick- room, and he felt around until his hand-came against a cloth saturated with water. He ap- plied it to the sufferer's head, talking as sooth- ingly as Bob's own mother could have done, and at last the poor boy dropped into an uneasy slumber, "I'll keep awake, and if he begins to rave again, I'll just bathe his head," said Boy, overjoyed at the result of his treatment. But his good intentions were not carried out, for in a few moments he was in a sound sleep, from which he did not wake till late in the morning.  Bob was still sleeping, and his deathly pale face, and the great ridges around his eyes,- struck a chill to Roy's heart.  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7402-00000092"/> I8o     Roy's Search. Roy's movements aroused Bob, who after much difficulty opened his swollen eyes. He smiled faintly as he saw Roy bending anxiously over him, and essayed to rise, but fell back on the straw with a groan. "Do you feel sick?" asked Boy. , "I feel awful hlere," was the reply, pressing his hand to his temple, and closing his eyes. "I guess something's the matter with my eyes, too-much as ever I can do to keep 'emr open, the light hurts 'em so!" "I'll fix that," said Ioy, and he looked around for something with which to curtain the one wi  ndow, and for want of anything better was obliged to hang up Bob's coat.

"I'll do it," answered Roy, with animation, "and you can lie still, and perhaps you will be able to go 'out this afternoon." Bob made no reply to this, but 'told Roy where to find the money for their breakfast. "I won't take all you have!" cried Roy, "but I'll wait for mine until I earn it." All Bob's persuasions could not move him from this determination; but the hot buttered rolls, and slices of cold meat did not taste' good to Bob, much to Roy's sorrow, who pressed them upon him, not realizing that he was too ill to eat. "I can't eat a mouthful," said Bob, turning away from the food. "All I want is water." t  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7402-00000093"/> 182     Roy's Searcz.

He kept his eye fixed on Roy, as with energy he bent to his task. "'Pon my word!" exclaimed the attorney, as Roy began upon: the second boot, "but  you're the neatest boot-black I've seen this month of Sundays.

In- temperance is such a violation; and the deadly blow that struck Willie to the floor, and caused the frightened flight of Lucy, were natural re- sults of your father's sin. Who kniows, how- ever, but the very bitterness of the fruits of his intemperance, may yet lead him to repent and reform? Keep praying and trusting; God can make the wickedness of man to praise Him, and overrule all things, so that at last salva- tion shall come to your afflicted family." ]Martha's heart responded to these timely words. She felt that she had sinned in dis- trusting her kind Heavenly Father, and thank- ing her teacher, said:  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7402-00000105"/> 205      Roy's Search. "Oh, I am sure you are right-pray that my faith may be increased!" Mrs. Hill now appeared, and Miss Gray fol- lowed her into the sick room. She was shocked at the change in the sick boy. His face was ghastly, and his breathing so faint that at first she doubted if he were alive. "He is in a very critical state," whispered Mrs. Hill, as they noiselessly left the apart- ment; "he has come out of the delirium into this stupor, and the doctor says lie must be kept perfectly quiet." "Poor boy!" ejaculated Miss Gray, as she started to go. Martha accompanied her to the gate. "Good night, Mattie," said Miss Gray; "and remember that the darkest time is just before day." Martha stood at the gate after Miss Gray had left her. The evening shadows were j   ,yohl  Williams.     207 falling, but far over in the west the rich sunset clouds still lingered. She was so absorbed in gazing and musing that she did not notice the timid approach of a young girl till she stood before her. "Mattie!" said the new-comer. "Jane Andrews!" and the two girls stood looking into each other's faces. Martha's expression was full of surprise and appre- tension. "Mattie," said Jane, in a trembling voice, "I've come to ask your forgiveness"--her voice failed her. "You have had it without asking," Martha elderly replied. "I'e been real unhappy all along," continued the girl, "you were so gentle when I was so ide that it only made me feel the worse, and when I heard that your brother was sick, and all through that dreadful rum, I felt worse  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7402-00000106"/> 2o8      Roy's Sarc.   - still, and to-day I heard something that set me almost crazy," and here she burst into tears again. Martha did not know what to say to comfort her, so she only pressed her hand.  Jane raised her face again, and said: "I feel that I must tell you, but you'll hate me forever. My father has a mortgage on this place and he's going to foreclose: I heard them talking about it, him and Ryder." "Are you sure?" asked Martha, as callly as she could. "I wish I wasn't, but he's coming over this very night," glancing around as she spoke; "haven't you got some friend that can pay this?" "No," replied Martha, bursting into tears. "Don't cry Mattie, dear," said Jane, in a husky voice, "here's something I've brought for Willie," passing her some delicacies.   7oohZ  Williams.    209 Martha took the gift, but she was sobbing so she could hardlyuet  her thanks, and Jane hurried of. Martha was almost overwhelmed with this new trouLble. "There is no help for it. I've no one to turn to, no friend that can advance this money!" she exclaimed. Then the words of her teacher came to her again; "No calamity can befall you so great as the loss of your trust in God." "How could I forget that?" she cried, and hastening to the barn, which seemed to be the most retired place for her, she knelt down, and called on God for help. As she prayed a great desire came into her soul for her father's conversion; oh, if he could only be brought to the light, she could bear to be turned out of house, home,--everytlhing; and full of this great longing she plead with God for him. It "  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7402-00000107"/> 20      Roy's Search. seemed as if she must be answered, and in mingled agony and hope she continued her  - supplications with strong crying and tears.  Now it chanced that John Williams had retired to the barn a short time before, sullen, and self-remorseful. The late terrible events, combined with a prolonged absence from his cups, had worked him up almost to a pitch of frenzy. He had crouched on the upper floor, trying to still the fierce longing of his appe- tite, and inwardly cursing, when Martha entered. Every word of her prayer went like an arrow to his heart, and obeying a strong impulse he silently descended the stairs, and sinking on his knees beside his daughter, his soul went forth to God for mercy, as he mentally followed her fervid words. Still Martha continued to plead, unconscious of his presence and the struggle going on in his heart.    i  iohn Williamns.   2" "Miartha, child," he exclaimed at last, and she scarcely recognized his voice, so broken and tremulous, "your prayer is answered; with God's help I'll be a different man." "Oh, father, father! I can bear anything now!" she cried, and tears of joy filled her eyes. She then told him of Jane Andrews' visit. "Dear father, pray with me that the house may be spared, for Willie's sake." John Williams' broken petitions were followed by Martha, and then with a heart strangely lightened Martha took the pears into Willie. As they were entering the sick-room, Martha asked her father if he had heard any tidings of Lucy. "None," he answered, with a deep emotion. There was a loud knock at the door, and, before it be could be answered, it was pushed open and a heavy step sounded in the passage.  5  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7402-00000108"/> 212     Roy's Scarch. Mrs. Hill, who was sitting by the sick boy, sprang up, and hastened out, fearing the noise would awaken the sleeper.  "Is Williams around?"  asked a rough i voice. "It is Mr. Andrews," whispered Martha,   "he's"-  She stopped, for her father's eyes were closed and his lips softly moving as if in prayer. He rose in a moment, and went into the next room. "I tell you I must have that money within twenty-four hours, or I shall foreclose. Can I have it?" Martha could not hear her father's answer, and the man broke out again: 'Oh, I know all about it-old story-no work, children sick or lost, wife in the asylum- that won't pay what you owe me!" "That man will wake Willie," said Mrs. Hill, much agitated.   7ohn I Williams.     213 "Sir," said she, opening the door, "I must beg you to lower your voice; we have a sick boy here whose life depends on being kept quiet." The rumseller, a red-faced, portly man, came forward at this, and thrust his head in at the door. "Sick, is he?" without softening his tone. "Well, he does look like a drowned rat, to be sure! 'Twan't drownin' done that!" with a backward leer at Mr. Williams. "No sir," said Martha, flushing at the impli- cation, "it was rum, rum sold by yourself!" The man, hard as he was, cowered an in- stant, at the unexpected retort, then recover- ing himself, shouted angrily: "You'll find it won't pay to scare me, Miss.

Without a word he followed the doctor. A moment later, and the physician returned alone. There was a self-satisfied smile play- ing over his benevolent face. Stepping to Mr. Williams, he laid a paper before him. He had paid the mortgage! Mr. Williams glanced at it, and then grasped the physician's hand. "How can I ever repay you?" he said, brokenly. Maxrtla went out of the room to hide the tears of thankfulness that choked her, but when the doctor came into the sick-room, a short time after, she knew by his happy ex- pression that her father had been telling him of the change in his feelings. As the doctor entered, Willie sat up in bed, and gazed around with bright, eager eyes.   yohn  Williams.     215 "What's the matter? Am I sick?" Martha sprang joyfully forward, but the doctor motioned her back, and there was an expression upon his face that made her tremble. "Yes, my boy, you are very sick; and you must lie down and try to be very quiet." Willie obeyed, and fixing his eyes upon the doctor, said: "You needn't fix that medicine for me, doctor, for I shall not live, any way. I'm go- ing to heaven to live with Jesus!" The words sank like lead into Martha's heart, and Mrs. Hill, smoothing his pillow, said: "No, no, child, you'll get well, and help sister in her garden." "I'm sorry about the garden, but Georgie'll take care of it,I guess. Where's George? I want to see him." ".::  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7402-00000110"/> 2 6     Roy's Search. Martha glanced inquiringly at the doctor; he nodded assent, and finding Johnnie, she sent him after the twin, who was working in Willie's stead at Mr. McDonald's. At the door Martha met the doctor, stealth- ily wiping away the tears. "You must control your feelings," he wlhis- pered. "Oh, doctor," cried Martha, "is he better or worse?" "Always be prepared for the worst," he said, evasively. Willie had called for his father, and the meeting between them was deeply affecting. Not much was said by the repentant man, but enough to let the boy know that there had been a change in him. "Oh, father," he cried, his pale face lighting up, "I'm happy now, but where's Lucy?" There was a deep silence; how could the   John Williams.    2 7 terrible truth of her loss be broken to the dying boy? "She shall be sent for," said the doctor, giv- ing him a composing draught as he spoke, and as George and Johnnie entered at the moment, they were spared the task of answer- ing the question. "George," said Willie, trying feebly to grasp his hand, "I want you to take care of the gar-, den. You know what my plans were-won't you carry them out? I don't think I shall live, but you can fill my place, George." He closed his eyes, still retaining his twin brother's hand, a grayish pallor settling over his face. In a moment he opened them again, and added, "I want you all to meet me in heaven. Stoop down here, father."  The whispered entreaty, and the appealing glance of his eyes, could not be withstood, and kneeling by the bedside, Mr. Williams offered  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7402-00000111"/> 2 I 8    Roy's Search. up a heart-broken petition. A radiance as if caught from the shining of the city whose gates he was fast approaching beamed in the boy's face, and with his hands clasped in the fulness of great joy, Willie passed away! The thrilling events of the last few weeks had taxed Martha's 'nerves to their utmost, and when she realized that the bright, loving brother was gone forever, she sunk to the floor unconscious.   1,  ,.

It happened to be under a street lamp, and a motley crowd soon gathered, English, Ameri- cans, Irish, Dutch, degraded representatives of many nations; and, instead of helping her up, they laughed and joked around the uncon- scious child, who was stunned by striking against the curbstone. The oaths and jeers (219)  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7402-00000112"/> 220     Roy's Search. attracted the attention of a policeman, who finding that no one knew her, took the child to the station-house. Enough was gleaned from her terrified story in the morning to satisfy the officer that she was stolen. "Just what my Lizzie said when I told her about it last night!" he said to his brother officers. "I'll take her home for a while, per- haps we 'll hear from her folks." "Lizzie" was a lively bustling little woman, who quite overwhelmed Lucy with questions, interrupting her at every other word with: "You dear child! Did you ever hear the like!" "Now, Lizzie," said her husband, who seemed much amused at her loquacity, "can't you satisfy your curiosity another time, and wash her up and give her something to eat? I reckon she's half starved."   ,Watcahin' ,for Matie.    22 I1 "Sure enough!" and Lucy was soon seated before a tempting breakfast, with her acling head cooled by soft bandages. During the week in which Lucy stayed in this pleasant home, every effort was made to find her parents; advertisements were inserted in all the local papers, and inquiries instituted in every direction, but no answer was received, and at last she was sent to the Home for Little Wanderers. Her kind entertainers were sorry to part with he-r, but the honest watchman had an old father and a blind sister to support be- sides his pretty wife. "Lucy was truly a " little wanderer," and it was sad to see the look of maturity and sorrow settling on the childish features, and although everything was done by the good matron and her companions to make her contented, at night she would sob herself to sleep with the words, "I want to see Mattie!"            . ,  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7402-00000113"/> 222     Roy's Search. "I'm greatly concerned about the child," said the matron, in her brisk way. "I wish some one would adopt her." One day an elegant carriage drove up to the Home, and a delicate, intellectual- looking  lady, dressed in deep mourning, was assisted  out.  "I've lost my little girl," she said to the ma- tron. "I'm all alone, with nothing to occupy my mind, and my husband advises me to adopt a child. May I see the children?" "Certainly," and the obliging matron showed Mrs. Gordon, as she called herself, over the building. The Home and its occupants inte- rested her deeply. There was the nursery in which were babes in cradles and cribs, rocked and tended by loving hands. There were sleeping-rooms with rows of clean, well-made beds; the dining-room, with its long tables neatly set, the school-room and chapel, where   Watching for Mattie.     223  Id and heart received appropriate culture. 3 visitor went all over the building, now ping to speak a loving word to some  uish boy, now imprinting a kiss on the rosy  !ek of some merry girl.

"Mattie is lost, and I can't find her!" and the eyes filled with tears again. The matron related as much of her history as had been gleaned from Lucy and the offi- cer's story, and the sad tale seemed to draw all thile mother in the lady's heart towards the lovely child. Lucy's eyes were fairly dazzled by the splendors that met her gaze in her new home. Mr. Gordon was a merchant absorbed in his counting-room from morning till evening; a tall, dignified man, of whom the child stood quite in awe. The first night, as Mrs. Gordon was putting her protege to bed, she said: "Lucy, my little girl, who has gone to heav- en, used to say her prayers to me every night; will you not do so?" The child knelt, and when she had finished   fatch ing'  for Mattie.  225 repeating "Now I lay me," after the lady, she looked up into her face and said: "Will God do everything I ask?" "If it is best," was the reply. "If I ask him to bring me to my Mattie, and the other children, will he?" "I hope so," said Mrs. Gordon, hesitatingly. Lucy folded her tiny hands, and closing her eyes, said softly: "Oh God in heaven, please make it best for me to see Mattie and the rest, for Jesus' sake. Amen." And full of faith that God would do it, she crept into the downy couch, and with a happy smile dropped asleep. The next day she posted herself.-at the front window to watch for Mattie, with her face pressed against the pane, and her eyes scanning each passer-by.

Everything was done by her kind friends to divert her thoughts from the all-absorbing subject, but in vain. If she had a new toy, she wished to show it to Mattie; or when some one gave her candy, she wished to give Jobnnie a piece; she was like the bird that pined in the gilded cage; her only amusement was in sitting at the long window watching for the favorite sister. A ragged little boy or girl would look up at the window of the palatial mansion, and per- haps envy the child with the long yellow curls and blue eyes, her elegant dress and sur- roundings; but ' every heart knoweth its own bitterness," and Lucy would have been happier far in her own home, miserable as it was.

"WHAT'S the idea exactly!" and Nicho- las Grum, sitting in his office, frisked off the big cushioned chair, in which he was ensconced, and placing his mouth to a tube communicating with the second story, gave some command. After ap- plying his ear to catch the answer, he nodded again, then breaking into a laugh at some fanny conceit. He assumed a grave air, how- ever, as a step was heard outside the door. "Here it is, sir!" and a bri: looking clerk entered, carrying a big fur cap. "That is sufficient, you may retire;" said (228)   Nicholas Grum.      229 ir.

"Just the thing,-your best friend wouldn't know you now, old boy!" said he to the re- flection. Then taking out his pocket-book he emptied it of part of its contents, and carefully counting the remainder, made a memorandum of the amount. "I'll be sure on that score," he said, and grasping his big cane, he peered into the front store to see if the clerks were all busy: then opening a private door that led into a side pas- sage, went out. But the good gentleman was wrong in his reckoning, if he thought he was unperceived, for, no sooner had he left, than half a dozen of the younger employees who were on "the i'^  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7402-00000117"/> 230     Roy's Searche. scent," were peeping slyly out of the window that overlooked the street. ( There goes the old fellow!" cried the one who had just entered the office; " he's'on thle track of something. Pretty good disguise that old cap, isn't it?" "Wonder what he's up to now?" inquired one of the others, pursuing a stray fly. "Some forlorn widder with 'nine small chil- dren,' " returned the other, as they went back to their work, adding dolefully, as his hands shook his empty pockets, "He can afford it, though!" Meanwhile Mr. Grum was walking through the crowded streets at a rapid pace. Reach- ing the corner of a street, he walked more slowly, and looked cautiously around. "There's the boy!" he murmured, " as busy as a bee, too. If he comes out all right, I may '--    Nicholas Grum.      231 B1ut Loy's customer had gone, and he was taking up his box preparatory to going home, so the old gentleman stepped forward. "Here, black my boots!" he said, gruffly. Eoy glanced up, for the voice sounded fa- miliar, but the gentleman's features were not very distinct under the enormous cap, and the short autumn day was drawing to a close, so he applied himself to his task with a will. "All right now, sir?" he asked, waiting for his pay. Nicholas Grum made no reply, but pulled out his wallet, gave him the customary price, and hurried away. "Well, old fellow," said Roy to Carlo, "we'll be going home now; poor Bob'll be lonely. What's this?" Directly in his path lay a purse! Roy stooped to pick it up, but on a second thought stopped.  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7402-00000118"/> 232     Roy's Search. "People seem to suspect me since I was at Mr. Sprague's," he said, gravely, "and if I open this the owner may say that I stole some from it-what shall I do?" There was a quandary, and Roy was puz- zling his young head over the question, when a gentleman approached. The boy gave him a' searching glance, and then stepping up to him, related the occurrence. "I want you to see me open it, sir," he said, earnestly, " and then if anything happens you'll bear witness that I didn't take anything, won't you?"  "That I will," replied the other, laughing. Roy picked up the book for the first time, and on opening it found eighty cents. "Let me take it now, my boy," said the genm tleman, and looking at it closely, he exclaimed, (' Why, this belongs to my old friend Nicholas Grum!"  .

"Roy," replied our hero. "I shall remember you, ROy," he said, "for an honest boy: here is my card." Roy read on the shining bit of pasteboard, Itev. P. Stone, 123   STREET. "Perhaps you'd direct me where to return the pocket book?" said Roy. The  clergyman had been regarding  him thoughtfully, and started as he spoke. "Yes, yes,'? he answered, absently. "Roy, Roy," he repeated, "strange, but your face re- minds me of a very dear friend. How long have you been a boot-black?"  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7402-00000119"/> 234      Roy's Searchl. This led to an account of Roy'fvaious ad- ventures, and the kind-hearted nan wax quite touched by the simple tale.     1 "Ancl this Bob you speak of--is he still sick?" he asked.

I suppose he finds it dull work!"  "O no, sir," replied Roy, " he says he feels happy most of the time; he did feel badly at first, but "-  Here he hesitated, but the good man soon drew from him the state of Bob's feelings.

"Guess he'll find out now I'm an honest boy!" lhe said, proudly, and .elated with this thought, he gayly traversed the very streets Nicholas Grum had gone abopt twty minutes before.

At last he met a boy about his own age, whose name struck Roy as being extremely funny, for he heard the clerks call him 'cash.' Cash stopped short upon seeing Roy. "Well, blackey, did you come to buy you a dress?" "I want to find Mr. Grum," replied Roy. "Oh, you do! Well, Mr. Grum's boots are so clean he wont need your services-keeps three niggers on purpose to clean them!" "Cash! cash!" was called  loudly from another part of the room, and the boy darted off.. "Did you say that you wanted Mr. Grum?" asked a voice close at hand, and Roy saw standing behind a neat railing a young man with a pen stuck over his ear. "Yes, sir," replied Roy, "where can I find him?"

"Thank you;" and Roy was going in the direction, when the young man called him back. "Mr. Grum is very busy at this moment," he said, opening a 'door set in the railing, "come in and sit down awhile." Roy felt quite grateful at this thoughtful kindness, after the rebuffs he had received from the other employees, and seated himself on the only seat the place afforded, which was a high stool. "Wlat did you say your business with Mr. Grum was?" pursued his new acquaintance. "This must be the head clerk," thought Roy. "I have found something that belongs to him," he answered.  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7402-00000121"/> 238     Roy's Search. "Ah indeed!" said the bookkeeper, "what is it?" "A purse," replied Roy. But his compan- ion's sharp eyes had already detected the am- ple purse, and his gaze rested greedily upon it. The clerk waxed genial and entertaining, patting Carlo, and telling stories to Roy, and when Roy rose to go, he asked where his boot- black'stand was, saying he should be sure and patronize him. The instant Roy was out of sight, the book- keeper slyly took something from under the big ledger and examined its contents. "Pooh!" he exclaimed," only a little change ; not worth the trouble of getting,-stay there till I do 'something else with you!" and he tossed it far into a dark corner. The green door was found, and Roy and Carlo were once again in the presence of Nicholas Grum. Oar hero advanced confi-   Nicholas Grum.      239 dentially, cap in hand. Carlo-the shadow- also advanced in the rear. "I have found something that belongs to you, sir!" began Roy, boldly, putting his hand into his pocket; but no purse was there! He fumbled in every corner, searched his other pockets, growing more confused each moment, conscious that the eyes of Mr. Grum were fol- lowing his movements. "Well, out with it-what did you find?" in- quired Mr. Grum. "It was a pocket-book, sir!" Mr. Grum, in turn, exalined the boy's pockets; "It's gone!" he exclaimed. "Whlat has become of it?" cried Roy, the picture of despair. "That's a question you can answer more accurately than I," dryly observed the old man; "If I mistake not you are the lad that picked  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7402-00000122"/> 240     Roy's Search. ten dollar bills off of barberry bushes down in Maplewood. Did I not meet you on the cars?" "Yes," stammered Roy, deeply coloring. "Thought so," nodding his head ; "do you remember the bit of advice I gave you then and there?" "Yes, sir." "Well, I suppose you have followed it- made it your rule in life," pursued Mr. Grum, sternly. "I presume you have no little bills un- settled; you don't spend every cent twenty hours after you earn it: and I presume you never went to the theatre, did you?" Poor Roy was so overwhelmed at what he considered the wonderful knowledge of the ter- rible Nicholas Grum, that he answered in the affirmative, without explaining the facts of the case. Mr. Grum regarded his changing countenance keenly, and setting his confusion down as an evidence of guilt, said angrily:   Nicholas Grum.      241 "And now you have the brass to come to ne, and say you have found my wallet, but are rery sorry," mimicking his tone,-" but you've ost it.

There's something in his eyes that fascinates me: fairly made me jump once to-night. Well, I must be doating to fuss so about a stranger!" And Nicholas Grum, seating himself at his desk again, fell into a reverie. That his thoughts were not all pleasant, showed in the sad eyes and bowed figure.

He could not find the courage to tell Roy of it, but now and then a hint of the feeling escaped lhim, that would have been full of meaning to Roy had not the latter been so absorbed in his business, happy in earning enough for himself, Bob and Carlo. And Bob repressed his feel- ings, that lie might cast no gloom over Roy's mind. So considerate and lovinng was he in the midst of pain and weariness. "Don't, Roy! hie answered, softly. "It'll be all right in the end, as you tell me when I want to get up and go to work." "Well, I say it's too bad," said Roy, his eyes full of tears, " it's terrible to have people always suspecting you, when you're honest." "There's one thing about it," observed Bob, gravely. "Them that's honest comes out right at last. Wish the old man would call here! wouldn't I tell him low you're working like a )YVUILII U rL Vuii ilrrrr riv rr J ver I v rr viilry  '   The Boot-black's Fzuneral.   245 dog just to take care of a good-for-notlhing boy lilke me." "Now, you shall not say so!" cried -loy, the thermometer of his spirit rising, as Bob's fell. Why, you dear old fellow, what should I do if it wasn't for you? Tell you it makes a man smart to have somebody to look out for," straightening himself up. Bob gazed affectionately at Roy as he said this, taking as much pride in his handsome face and straight figure as his owni mother would could she have seen him. "We should be lonesome enough without Bob, wouldn't we, Carlo?" Carlo was chasing a big fly at that moment, and snapped it up, wagging his tail, and chewing the unfortunate insect at the same time; and, having done this, he pursued his tail, but, unluckily, in the height of his fun, he  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7402-00000125"/> 246     Roy's Searczh. bit it severely, and his air of mortification sat the two boys-laughing. "Now you know how good it is to be eaten!" cried Roy throwing his cap at him. Carlo dexterously caught it and ran off to a corner, shaking it as if it had been a rat, his black eyes shining with mischief. The darkness coming on, Roy called the dog to him, and seated himself upon ;the edge of the bed. "What a careless boy I am!" he cried, starting up again, " here we have not had any supper;" and putting on his cap he was gone. Carlo started after him, but Roy sent him back to 'keep Bob company.' When Roy returned with a dish of milk- toast, and a candle, the dog sat licking the sick boy's hand. "I've got the jolliest supper," said Roy, lighting the candle, and setting it into an old .   Thze Boot-black's Fzuneral.  247 bottle, "and you'll eat some, wont you, old fellow "?" Bob took a few mouthfuls to satisfy Roy, swallowing it with an effort, Roy feeding him with a spoon. "Bob," said he, breaking the silence, "I didn't tell you the minister says he is coming to see you; we must fix up a little, first," glancing about the room. "How soon?" asked Bob. "Right away," answered Boy, "perhaps to- morrow." "It may be too late, then," said Bob, quietly. "Why?" inquired Roy, dropping the spoon and gazing at him. His friend made no reply, and Roy noticed how wan he looked.  His eyes were very large and bright, setting off the paleness of his. face in a startling manner; his hands, once so brown and chubby, were delicate and fair as  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7402-00000126"/> 24.8     Roy's Search. a girl's, the blue veins showing distinctly through the skin. Boy seized it and squeezed it tightly in his own. How cold it was! "Bob," he cried, earnestly, " why don't you answer?" Bob turned his head slowly towards him, a strange expression, sad, yet triumphant, and even of exultation, beaming in his face. "I shall be in heaven!" he whispered, "I- am- going-now "-and with a sigh he was gone! So peacefully, without a struggle, did the little boot-black pass away, that his faithful friend could not realize it for some moments. "Bob! Bob!" he called, " speak to me!" Bob's voice would never again sound in his ears in this world. His friend, the only conm- panion he had, was gone forever, and Roy, throwing his arms around his dead friend's neck, sobbed long and bitterly   7he Boot-black's Funeral.   249 "Oh, why did God take, you?" he cried. "All my friends are taken from me. Other boys can have parents, and brothers, and sis- ters, but my only friend is dead!" The candle died away in its socket, emble- m'atic of the life that had departed, but still Roy lay alternately weeping and thnking. Bob's joyful expressions of piety came back to him, mingled with his affectionate ten- derness. "You are thoe one that told me how to be so happy,")' he had said to Eoy, "and I shall thank you always for it." These words Roy recalled, while a softer ex- pression stole over his tear-stained face. "He is happier now than ever," he said, softly, and now he almost rejoiced in his friend's happiness as he tried to imagaie him, white-robed, with a harp in his hand, singing hosannas to that Jesus who had washed his  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7402-00000127"/> 250     Roy's Siarch. sins away. Filled with these musings lie fell 'asleep. He was awakened by a rude shaking, and opening his eyes, saw the shrivelled face of their old landlady, Sally. The sight of her quickly aroused him, for he had an unaccount- able horror of her. "Pretty doin's we has here - one boy lying all the time, and 'tother one only a grain bet- ter. Come, Bob, wake up!" and she stooped to shake him. "Stop! stop!" shouted Roy, pushing her hland away, " he's "- He choked and stopped. "Oh!" cried the crone, peering down, " the boy's dead! TWho'd a thouglt it," she adced. "Why he was as lively as a cricket when I come in yesterday, though he didn't want to be moved when I tried to make him get up and go work." "How can you talk so about him! He was   The -oot-black's Fuizeral.  25  the dearest, gentlest boy!" cried Boy, indig- nantly, the tears streaming over his cheeks. "He'll have to be buried right away," mut- tered the womian, "the sooner the better; of course there's nothin' to pay the expenses." Roy had not thought of that, but old Sallie was used to such cases. Many a life had gone out in the crazy tenements of which she was the mistress; often had the cart that conveyed the indigent dead to the lot without the city, stood before her door. Leaving Roy absorbed in grief, she slipped off, and returned with an officer, who after a short consultation left. A few hours later and all that was mortal of poor little Bob was placed in a rude board coffin. Roy took a last- lingering look of his friend; the box was closed, and the cart rattled over the stone pavements in a wnay that made Roy shudder.  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7402-00000128"/> 252     Roy's Search. He went slowly up the long steep stairs to the attic cliamber, and sat sorrowfully down, Carlo resting his nose on his knee. Winter was setting in; the rain that had been falling all day was changing to snow; he was cold, and lonely, and wretched. He was unconscious that a faint feeling was stealing over him, caused from his having eaten nothing since the night before; but Carlo soon called the fact to mind by a series of pleading sounds that his master understood. "Hungry, are you?" looking down upon him. "You are all I have left now, doggie; and you shall have all you want." And taking from his prized carpet-bag the cherished like- ness of his mother, he gazed long and earnestly at it, saying, "If I could only find her; but I cannot, it's useless to try any more." And putting on his worn cap, he went out into the street, in a listless way, quite unusual to   The Boot-black's Funeral.  253 him, and spent the little change he had for a scanty meal for himself and Carlo. It was, however, no unusual thing, for his small earnings were all gone by night, although he had followed Bob's plan and laid by a part of his money each day to pay the rent. A dark figure brushed past him in the storm, and Roy recognized Jack the boot- black, who had made the assault on him. "Hollo -you!" cried Jack, turning back. "Have it all your own way now, won't you?" "Why?" asked Roy. "Now he's kicked the bucket, nice, isn't it?" sneered Jack. Roy tried to pass him, but the bad boy crowded him close against the side of a build- ing. "I isn't done with ye yet!" he said, pinion- ing Roy's arms to his side; "I hate the 'sight of you, you sneaking hypocrite!

I'll spile your games just as sure's my name's Jack, do you hear that?" pushing him harder as lie spoke. "Let me go!" cried Roy, struggling to break away, but Jack had him in his power, and with an ugly glare in his bold eyes he held him fast. "I'll hunt you out of the city," he went on, "if you don't stop blacking boots on that corner. I want that place, low Bob's done for, and thlat corner I'll have, or I'll"- His sentence was left unfinished, for a hand was laid heavily upon his shoulders, and Roy saw it was Nicilolas Grum! "Let the boy alone!" he said, and Jack slunk away, only too glad to be let off so easily. Roy lept in the shadow, and if the old gen- tleman recognized the boy who disturbed him   The Boot-black's Ffz1neral.   255 so strangely, he did not make it known, but walked rapidly on. The encounter with the bad boy, and the sight of the old man, bringing to recollection the affair of the purse, made our hero sadder, lonelier than before. He was too discouraged to black boots then, if the storm that was in- creasing had not prevented it, and with his summer clothing vet, hle hurried home. A cheerless afternoon was in prospect for him, truly, but Roy found some comfort in reading from his mother's Bible. Child that he was, he knew already that in that inspired volume was strength for the weak, and conso- lation for the afflicted. With his mother's Bible, and his faithful Carlo, our Roy was not all alone.  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7402-00000130"/> XVIII.

The day had been unpleas- ant, and he had given orders to close the store early. The clerks had been gone a few mo- ments, and the great room was empty save himself and Mike. The faithful servant stood in the centre of the room, cap in hand, guarding a heap of rub- bish with an air that amused his master. "Well, my man, what is the matter?" asked Mr. Grum, smiling, Mike lifted a black object that lay on the (256)   Something   Wrong.    257 heap, and with a flourish placed it in his em- ployer's hand. "Bless me!" cried Mr. Grum, opening it as he spoke, and counting the money, " all here, too. Where did you find it, Milke?" Mike's face was overspread with a broad grin of delight at having done something to serve his employer. "Jist in there, sir!" opening the book-keep- er's door. "In there -in Harrison's place?" repeated Mr. Grum, bewildered. "An sure if I didn't!" said Mike, ear- nestly. "Ye see, sir, I was sthriving to put things safe for the night, an' I coom here, yer honor, an' me nose shmelt a burnin'; I shniffed aginy sir, an' sez I,' its some o' that careless Harri- son's doin's.'

"IaTrrison knew very well I forbade thle clerks lighting a match in the building!" cried Mr. Grum, angrily, " and I'll be obeyed!" "Thin sir," continued Mike, "I see the lhape of papers in the corners, an' I was gathering thim in me arrums, whin I felt the purse, sir, an' I knew it for your honor's, for many's the time I've seen that same in your ginerous hand, an' many's the blessing be the same token ye'll be afther having from the poor cratlhurs it's given food an "- But Milike stopped, for his master's eye had caught a familiar name upon a letter that lay in the heap, and holding it nearer to the gas, he read it; then hastening to his office, he turned over the pile of letters that hung above   SomethZing W/rong.    259 his desk, until he came to one bearing the same date and signature; comparing the two, he uttered an exclamation of surprise, and going back to the book-keeper's desk, he took from the great iron-bound safe the journal and ledger. Pencil in hand he rapidly added a few columns of figures. "There is something wlrong here!" he said, anxiously. "Any orders, sir?" asked Mike, having finished his duties. "No," said Mr. Grum, adding as the honest fellow was leaving, "I would like gou to keep dark about finding my purse, Mike!" "Your honor can depind on me for that," was the answer, "niver a word of that same shall cross me lips!" A strong suspicion had entered the mind of Nicholas Grum; for the first time he doubted  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7402-00000132"/> 260     Roy's Search. the honesty of his book-keeper. He fought it-he could not bear' to harbor the thought. Young Harrison he had befriended in many ways. ' "It cannot be!" he said, as he sat il his library that evening. "A man must be pretty sharp to cheat me, and yet I am aftaid all is not right. Harrison has fought shy of me lately, and it was only last Sunday I saw him driving out of town. I am not religious my- self; but it don't look well in a young man to spend the day so!" The matter of the purse had slipped his mind in the greater affair of his business. He retired, but could not sleep; the convic- tion grew firmer in his mind that Harrison was dishonest, to what extent he knew not. "I'll sift this matter to the bottom!" he ex- claimed. The next day he waas nervously pacing the   Somethigg Wrong.    261 floor of his little office, when there was a slight tap at- the door, and the Rev. Mr. Stone entered. "Am in a great hurry," said he, "but thought I'd step in and see how you came out about the purse." Nicholas Grum gazed at him in astonish- ment. How had his caller got hold of that? "Havn't you received it yet?" asked the good man, anxiously. "You must be gifted with second sight!" cried Nicholas Grum. "How did you know about it?" Then the clergyman related the history of his meeting with our Roy, showing his name and the memorandum of the eighty cents in the purse, not forgetting to speak of his care of Bob. "Bless his heart!" ejaculated, Nicholas Grum, blowing his nose violently, and stamp-  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7402-00000133"/> 262      Roy's Search. ing excitedly around the room during the re- cital. "Well, my friend," he said at the close, "I'll tell my part of the story now, and you'll agree with me that I am an old addle-head!" "You were a little hasty," said Mr. Stone, when the old man had described the manner in which he had sent the boy off, " but facts were against him, I must allow, and you say the purse is found at last?" "Here it is, all right!" cried Mr. Grum, "and that purse with its eighty cents may be the cause of saving my business." And he confided to his friend his fears about Harrison. "Can you not see the hand of Providence in this?" asked the clergyman. "You were led by some unaccountable feeling to notice this boy, then to try his honesty, and the very weapon you used is turned in another  .         Something Wrong.    263 direction, revealing the dishonesty of one in your employ." Mr. Grum making no reply, he continued: "I have been so occupied that I have not found time to visit his friend, but shall do so to-morrow, if possible;" and .bid- ding him adieu, he departed. That night, after the store was closed, a sharp, shrewd-looking man bent over the accounts of the firm. A rapid, unerring accountant, he had been employed by Mr. Grum to examine the books.  The most skilfully arranged system of accounts could not escape his eagle eye; and with Mr. Grum's assistance many fraudulent transactions were laid bare. He grew nervous and excited as the hours of the night slipped by, but the cool, methodical accountant heeded not his interruptions, but kept at his work, adding and ,comparing, with only a brief word as some new fraud was brought to lighlt. When the  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7402-00000134"/> 264     Roy's Search. gray light of morning broke, two thousand dollars were found to have been abstracted! "Probably that is not the extent," said the gray-haired book-keeper. "I'll be here again to-night." At the end of three days the sum of six thousand dollars was found to be missing. "What shall be done?" cried Nicholas Grum, agitated and grieved at the duplicity of Har- rison. "Let him suffer!" said the man of accounts, solemnly. "He is too dangerous a character to be left loose a day." "I am weary of the whole affair!" returned Mr. Grum. "Not an -hour have I slept for four nights, and I can recover nothing from the boy." "I will take the necessary steps for you," said the accountant," for I think a man's duty is plain, when he is swindled as you have been."   Something TWrong.     265 Young Harrison, upon entering the store the next morning, found his employer there. Withl his usual off-hand salute he hurried to his desk, and was about opening the .safe, when Nicholas Grum laid his hand on the door, saying: "You will let those books alone hereafter, sir!" The guilty youth grew pale on meeting the -stern white face. "You have robbed me of six thousand dol- lars, and you are my prisoner!" Harrison's eyes glared like a cornered beast's, and thrusting the old man from him, he bounded to the door, but too late,--an officer awaited him there, and the unhappy clerk was borne away to meet the punish- ment of his crimes. Little did he dream that the pocket-book he so dexterously abstracted from the friendless boot-black's jacket, had led to detection.  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7402-00000135"/> 266      Roy's Search.     r But Nicholas Grum was now counting the wallet among his treasures. The interest lihe had before felt for Roy, was stronger than ever. "Noble little fellow!" be would say, "he shall be abundantly rewarded for all he hlas suffered!" But the exciting events in connection with the trial, the consultation with lawyers, and the straightening of business matters, occupied Mr. Grum's time; he was driven with business  from morning till far into the night. "You are killing yourself," said his head clerk to him, one day. "Oh, I've worked harder than this," answered Nicholas, but not in the old cheery tone; he had grown "strangely blue," he said to him- self; the old homesick feeling he had when a boy, away at a dismal boarding-school with a grim automaton of an instructor, coming over him. .   Something  Wrong.     267 "No wonder," he thought, as he sat in his lonely dining-room, eating his dinner, opposite nMrs. Sweet the housekeeper. Her name was not an index of her disposition, however. "I'm a lonely, forsaken old man. I deserve it all," as he gloomily picked a chicken leg with his fork; " yes, it's all my fault!" He was not thinking of his business then, or of the treachery of the trusted Harrison, but another picture of far more importance to his happiness was in his mind. What; was it?   &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7402-00000136"/> XTX. "b anC b fIx tarpr^. ES, I shall have to do it!"But Roy, X) sitting on the corner of a box in the attic, still hesitated. He held Bob's great coat, and was caressing it with his purple fingers, the big tears coursing over his cheeks, as the loved form of the wearer took shape in his mind's eye beneath it. "If it wasn't such cold weather," he mur- mured. "I'm most frozen, but it's dreadful to take Bob's coat; I can see him now standing 4:^  with it on! O dear!" and Roy broke utterly' down as the memory of Bob's kindly face and brisk, business-like figure came upon him. The weather was now intensely cold, and (268)   yed and the Shavpers.    269 Roy, in the icy streets of Boston, felt the bleak ocean winds pierce to his bones. The summer suit, now almost worn out, although Bob's long pants had been added, offered no obstruction to the keen blasts from the nostrils of the Ice King. His poor numb fingers had gone over the boots of the few customers who patronized him, in a slow way, that brought forth some rather unpleasant adjectives from the rougher of them. -If they, in warm overcoats, fur caps and mittens, shivered while standing a moment at the corner, Roy must have suffered extremely. He had crept home this cold day, almost frozen, and utterly discouraged. Only ten cents had he earned, and he felt that he could stand the chill air no longer; the last recourse must be resorted to, and that was-Bob's coat. % Wiping the tears away with his jacket-sleeve he proceeded to array himself in that sacred relic, and tying over his ears an old silk hand-  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7402-00000137"/> 270      Roy's Search. kerchief that he had found, he sallied forth again, followed by Carlo, whose countenance, we regret to state, did not wear a very cheer- ful expression, in the prospect of a curb-stone for a seat, and a battle with the slarp-edged winds. 'Roy's business had been decreasing for the last two weeks. Gentlemen were in too much of a hurry to get to warm offices to mind the stfate of their boots, and the ground would per- sist in freezing, despite the sighs of the mem- bers of Roy's profession, for whom muddy crossings have a special charm. "If it would only thaw," said Roy, as lhe walked rapidly along; " if it holds on this way, where's the money coming from to pay old Utp  Sallie, and she'd turn me out of doors quick as a wink if I was behind!" The great question of ways and means put new energy into the little boot-black, and   'ed and the Sharpers.    27I his tones rang out clear as a bell ag he called: "Black your boots, sir! Shine 'em up for you, sir!" Many a passer-by, attracted by the musical voice and bright intelligent eyes of the long- coated boot-black, seemed half inclined to give him a job; but the morning wore on and little had he done. Roy had gone to a cheap eating-house to purchase a small supply of food, and was just returning, when he started, so much agitated as to drop his blacking-box. For, a few doors off, stood Jedediah Sprague, talking with a police officer! Roy drew near and overheard some snatches of the conversation. "How much did you say he took?" "Five hundred dollars," replied Jedediah. Then after some words which Roy, who stood spell-bound, listening with intense inter- est, could not distinguish:  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7402-00000138"/> / 272      Roy's Search. "I told the old folks I'd find hilm sure, if he was in Boston, and if you'll just keep on the lookout, Mr. Officer, I'll pay you for any trou- ble you're at!" "Farmer Sprague still thinks I took the money, and Jedediah thinks so too, and they are going to arrest me for a thief ;" and Roy, grieved, resentful, and terrified, fled from the spot. He passed rapidly around the corner, then wandered slowly up a street, feeling de- cidedly blue, when the door of a store opened, and the lad who acted as errand boy came out. He was nofstranger to Roy, many a lively word having passed between them. "Old felIow's got nervous, can't see his face in his boots, wants you to fix 'em " he said, I:  briskly; " come along in!" "What, in there-in the store?" asked Boy. "Yes. You wouldn't have him expose his delicate nose to the cold? Expects a green-   yed and the Sharpers.    273 horn from the country for his next wictim. Devours six a day on an average. Don't he fix 'emr!" Many a time had Roy stood befoie the door pondering what the words "Inventor's Ex- change," pasted on each large light, could mean, and wondering at the queer articles that filled the shop. Pleased was he now to have his curiosity gratified, and gain a customer also, and he followed the boy, in his usual observing way. The fore part of the store was used as a book-stand, and the Exchange oc- cupied a platform elevated four or five steps above the former. A museum it was, truly. Patent wash- boilers, wash - tubs, wringers, churns, brooms that propelled themselves and gathered their own sweepings, umbrellas,  !: safety-valves, labor-saving, money-making ma- chinery of all kinds, some really useful, others mere catch-traps for the confiding.

The proprietors were Mr. Shortman and Doctor Salisbury, as he was called, although who or what he doctored, was a mystery; unless he sometimes tried his skill in setting the bones of a rickety machine. 'Mr. Shortman was the principal partner or presiding genius of the establishment. He was a short thick-set man, with a bold, disagreeable black eye, studiously arranged hair, and a long, polished red nose that arrested our hero's eye at once,- as the man came forward, dressed in faultless black broadcloth, his hands in his pockets jingling some coppers, and placing a foot daintly upon the block, bade Roy, " put on   yeed and the Sharpers.    275 plenty of blacking and do them in his best style!" That his presence was not of much import- ance in this individual's eyes Roy perceived as this worthy resumed his conversation with his partner. "I tell you I can do it!" "But the territory has been sold three times over," objected the other, whose light hair, blue eyes, and straight lithe figure, formed a striking contrast with his partner. "We shall save ourselves trouble by sending him further west!" "No, he'd see through that," responded Shortman; "can't come a Bwild goose chase selling the invention to the inhabitants of a western prairie on him. He's too cute; but I'll handle him.

O  o-oo-- leave this old boy alone!" and he put his fin- ger on his ear significantly, and snapped his wicked eyes in an artful and comical way. The opening of the street door stopped the conversation, and Shortman, peering out from behind the screen that hid a portion of the room,- exclaimed in an under-tone, winking at his partner: "There he is now! Good day to you, sir," said he, stepping from the block, and extend- ing his hand- to the new comer. "Just in time; man just gone that's been begging us to let him have that territory, but I told him that I wanted a smart, active, business man like you to take the thing in hand.

The new comer was behind Roy, who was gathering his blacking things together, but his cheery words in answer brought him to his feet in a twinkling, and turning, he found him-   7ed and the Sharpe rs.    2" self facing Jedediah! Roy was about to rush into the street-again, but a second thought de- tained him, and he drew quietly back and stood behind the stove, as if waiting for his pay. "Keep your eyes peeled, and you'll see fun now," whispered Charlie. The old man'll do him brown, I'll bet!" There was no need of any urging, for Roy was absorbed in studying his friend's counte- nauce and listening to the words of the sharp- ers. M1r. Shortman had drawn his chair at a confidential distance from Jedediah, and with his black eyes fixed upon him, was pouring forth a volume of smooth sentences, that quite overwhelmed his customer, who found it im- possible to get a word in edgeways. "Well," said Jedediah, at last, "if it is as you say"- "Hey-what?" cried Shortman, putting his hand to his ear, and bending forward.  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7402-00000141"/> 278'     Roy's Search. "VIy! how deaf we have grown," whispered the clerk to RPov.- "As I remarked afore, if it's the truth," said Jedediah, in a louder tone. "Hey?" repeated Mr. Shortman,   whose hearing seemed to be getting worse each mo- ment. "If it's as you say," reiterated Jedediah, shouting in the other's ear, "I'll take it!" "Very good," said Mr. Shortman, " you shall have it. Doctor, yotget the circulars, and we'll "- "But I hav'n't seen it yet," screamed Jede- diah, and the sharper seemed to understand. Going to a corner of the room, he brought for- ward a clock, and setting it carefully upon the table, said: "There's the article. T Wind that up once, and it will go forever, as I may say; never stops, never tires, by land or by sea that clock   red and the Sharipers.    279 will tick on.

"That's an idea!" said Jedediah. "Hey?" inquired Shortman. "He thinkls that it's a great idea," said Salis- bury. "An idea that men have studied over since the world began," resumed Shortman, "and this clock, which stands in no other office in the city of Boston, cost the inventor his life, as it were." "Is it possible!" shouted Jedediah, still gaz- ing at the clock. "Just you hear him now," put in the boy, nudging Roy, "he'll make that green un's eyes water!"  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7402-00000142"/> 280     Roy's Search. "The inventor was one of my particular friends," continued the owner of the Exchange, in a melancholy tone, "a man whom to know was to love and reverence. He was a pious man, and poor; and on that account I helped him along; in fact I may say I supported him for years. It used to make my heart ache to see that man toil, sir: working like a dog day and night, sometimes spending the whole twenty-four hours at his experiments. His friends turned the cold shoulder on him, and predicted that he would not succeed; but I told, them to let him alone, there was something in him out of the common run. I'd see that his family didn't suffer,-interesting family it was,  too.

But in vain, he was too happy to live; and," here Mr. Shortman hesitated, pulled out a white handkerchief and wiped his eyes. "It was too much for him. The next morning he was in another land than this." Sympathetic Jedediah fulfilled Charlie's prediction during the conclusion of this story, and Roy Mwas ready to cry out with indigna- tion as he saw the doctor retire behind him to suppress his mirth at the cleverness of his companion. "Very sad occurrence," said Jededialh, blow- ing his nose, and wiping his eyes with his handkerchief. "Yes, and I felt for his family," returned Shortman, "and it is for them I am selling State and County rights for this wonderful clock. There's a fortune in it, as I tell the young ladies, for there are no sons..

Roy was revolving a question in his mind as he listened to the conversation. He could not endure the thbught of making himself known to his old friend, having some pride about not succeeding better in making a living, but besides this, he feared Jedediah trusted him no longer. That Jedediah, however, did not recognize him in his strange apparel, he knew by the careless glance he cast at him, as he surveyed the room in true country style. But how could he sit still, and let the warm- hearted Jedediah be cheated by such rascals? He resolved to prevent it somehow, and anx- iously and tremblingly waited for a suitable opportunity.   yed arnd the Sharpers.   283 "I know you will not let such a chance slip," said Mr. Shortman, patting Jedediah on the shoulder. "I'll be ready to guarantee you one hundred dollars profit per day after you get the thing started. What shall I tell the young ladies?" Whether- the 'young ladies' or the fortune weighed the most in the scale, Jedediah decided instantly. "I don't understand that perpetual motion," he said, deliberately, "but if you'll warrant it, I'll take the territory." "Warrant it?" repeated Shortman, after Jedediah had screamed it in his ear the second time, "look at the machinery again; don't you see the secret is there?" Jedediah. examined it critically, although he knew no more about it than did his mother's pet Brahma. "Look sharp!" whispered Charlie, capering  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7402-00000144"/> 284      Roy's Searcz. about noiselessly as the customer's back was turned. Unluckily, however, he trod upon Carlo's tail, which elicited a howl, and forget- ting himself, doggie snapped wrathfully at the offender. "What's the matter?" asked Shortman. "Dog bit his tail, catching feas!" was Charlie's ready rejoinder, for living in the atmosphere of dishonesty he was fast getting to be an adept in deceit. "I havn't no gab to talk things into folks," said Jedediah, " but as you warrant it, and the thing bears inspecting, I have two minds to take hold. Should have to go to the hotel to get my money, though." "How long would it take you?" asked Shortman. "Might be longer or shorter," returned Jedediah, "just as I legged it!" '  "Well, you'll have to leg it to get here be-   'ed and the Sharpers.    285 fore the other man comes in," said Salisbury, pulling out his watch. "He's due at twelve, and it's five minutes to that now!" Roy's time had come, and saying to Charlie he 'would step in again for his change,' he slipped quietly out. A moment later Jede- diah, full of the great invention, strode out, Roy following until he was out of sight of the Exchange. "Mister," he cried, disguising his voice, "wait a minute, I want to tell you some- thing!" "Clear the track, youngster!" replied Jede- diah, his long legs carrying him forward so fast that Roy had to run to keep up with him. "Don't- want my boots blacked!" Finding he could not stop him thus, Roy resorted to stratagem. "Mister," he bawled again, "have you lost your watch?"  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7402-00000145"/> 286      Roy's Search. The thought of losing the 'lump of silver' brought Jedediah to a stand. "No," he said, angrily, finding it still in its place, " what did you stop me for, you young rascal?" "Because-because," cried Roy, out of breath, "they're trying to rob you. They're after your money! The men at the Inventor's Exchange!" he continued, " they are fooling you. That's notheing but an old useless clock!" Jedediah stared at him in bewilderment. "I was in there blacking the rascal's boots," explained Roy, "and if you'll wait I'll tell you all about it!" Jedediah was all attention, while Roy re- peated what was said before he came. Little did Jedediah think who was saving his money from the maw of the shark that laid in wait for him, as he walked beside Roy,   Jed and the Sharpers.    287 whose fantastic dress and red handkerchief was a complete disguise. "Thank you, boy," he said; " if you've done me a good turn you shall be paid for it, and I won't blow on you, either. I'll see you again soon. I've come to Boston to hunt up a young chap "-but before the sentence was finished, Roy anticipating what was coming and dread- ing discovery, took to his heels. "See!" ejaculated Jedediah, "what scared that youngster so! How I wish I could find Roy-the dear little fellow-that boot-black spoke just like him, sometimes. -I am afraid I shall never see him again. O that John Graham, how I'd like to get the grip of the law on him for taking that money." Roy went back to his business, casting fur- tive glances up and down the street to see if Jedediah was not heaving in sight again, yet with his heart lightened by the good he had  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7402-00000146"/> 233     Roy's Search. done: and, as if to reward him, he had several customers during the afternoon. Just before going home, after buying supper for himself and Carlo, he ran into the Inventor's Exchange to collect the five cents. The two partners were looking decidedly blue, and Roy was not surprised when Char- lie found a chance to say: "The chap from the country wasn't such a gummy, after all!" "Why?" asked Roy. "Hasn't showed hide nor hair, and old Shortman's mad enough to bite a board nail in two!" Roy, fearing he would perform that dread- ful operation on him, withdrew; but he could not resist a few expressions of delight as he ran home. He was in the midst of his antics when who should he see standing at an eating-house 6   7ed and the Sharpers.    289 window but his old enemy, Jack, the boot- black. He was looking very thin and pale, and the greedy expression in his eyes as he watched the people eat, struck to Roy's tender heart. "Are you hungry?" he softly asked. "What's that to you?" he retorted, fiercely. Go about your business." "I know you are," replied Roy, resolutely; "please take this." The tempting turnover was too much for Jack to resist. He seized it, and ate it vora- ciously. "You're a good boy," he said, brokenly. "I wouldn't take it from you, but I've been sick, and the old woman I lives with took all I got to pay my lodgin', and I hav'n't eaten nothin' scarcely for a week." "That's too bad!" cried Roy; "you shall have this," producing a buttered roll. 19  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7402-00000147"/> 290     Roy's Search,. "No, no," said Jack, keeping his eyes from it, as if to resist temptation, but before lihe could say more Roy had laid it on a projec- tion of the window, and whistling to Carlo, was out of sight. "I've made fun of his bein' pious," said Jack, as he devoured the biscuit, "but he's done what the other fellows wouldn't, on top o' my treatin' of him so!" How much good that act of kindness did, Roy never knew: for shortly after, coring across a sailor acquaintance, Jack went on a whaling voyage. But with him, among the coarse low company, went also the memory of the self-sacrificing life of the little Christian boot-black. he had been faithful to his friend Bob, he could also be forgiving and magnanimous towards his enemy Jack.   7o77. M ,Y XX. at, oIN^, mab aNcing. THE days passed on, and Roy, in his dilapidated garments, still kept man- fully at his business, making barely enough to meet his expenses. Often did the two friends go supperless to bed; but Carlo, to tell the truth, fared the better, and looked the brightest, for Roy would give him the last morsel, and cheerfully go without, that his only companion might not be hungry. Deprived of playmates, the dog was his confi- dant in everything, and it was really surprising to see the sympathy wilth which Carlo entered into his joys and sorrows. He was a faithful thermometer of his master's feelings; if Roy  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7402-00000148"/> 292     Roy's Search. was discouraged and lonesome, Carlo's whole expression,--from the corners of his mouth to the tremulous droop of his tail,--was doleful in the extreme. But if Roy, through turn of fortune, grew hopeful, Carlo's face fairly shone, his eyes sparkled like diamonds, he wagged his tail, barked, frisked and leaped as if beside himself with joy. But Roy's countenance was very grave of late. Bob's death had left an impression that deepened as the cold days crept on. The boy's busy, active brain had abundant opportunity for meditation in his isolated life,: for, with all his longings for companionship, there was something that held him back from the society of the lawless youths around. On Sundays, especially, now that the weather was cold, he had no other resource but thought; and a ripening time it was for the blessed truths found in his mother's Bible. With   Pat, Police, and Patching.   293 Carlo's head resting on his knees, he would sit for hours alternately reading and musing. He had heard nothing from Jedediah, and often wondered what had become of him; but he was satisfied that the sharpers at the ".Inventor's Exchange" had, through his own well-timed interposition, lost a victim. One raw, cold day, he was standing in his usual place, having just blackened a customer's boots, when his attention was drawn to an Irishman, who was looking curiously at him. The former seemed satisfied with the result of his scrutiny, for he sprang forward exclaiming : "An' sure but there's the cratur now!" and peering down at Carlo, who sat dignifiedly on the curb-stone, he added, "you're the very baste, me jewel, an' who might yez be sthop- pin' wid?" As Carlo did not reply, Roy answered, laughing:  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7402-00000149"/> 294      Roy's Search. "He's my dog!" "Your dog, is id?" cried Erin, and Roy found himself seized by the collar. "Och, an' I've caught yez, ye thafe! I'll take yez to the police,-sthole me missus' dog, an' her- och! ye ongrateful crathur," addressing Carlo, who had sprung to his master's defence, "will yez be afther devourin' yer ould friend, him as rescues ye from the blackguard of a boy!" and still grasping Roy, he attempted also to clutch Carlo, who snapped savagely at his fingers, whenever he reached them forth. "Let me go!" cried Roy, almost strangled by the Irishman's efforts to hold him -and catch at the same time the agile dog. "Let yez go, is id?" he repeated, "is Pat a fool that he shud let a thavin' scamp of a "- "What's the matter here?" asked a police- man, stopping before the trio. Is id .yerself, Mister Officer, dear?" cried   Pat, Police, and Patching.    295 Pat. "tHere's a dirty crathur as mesilf has caught,-be aisy, now!" as Roy still struggled. "I hav'n't done anything," protested Roy. "Och, an' mayhap he don't call stalin' the missus' linen from the clothes-line, an' run-7 ning off wid her pit, anything. Maybe a small job like that couldn't be remimbered, your honor,-aisy, aisy, you baste!" as Roy tried to free himself from the rough grasp, and Carlo bit at his shins. "Leave the lad alone," said the officer, placing his hand on Roy's shoulder. "I have often noticed the boy, but if you are sure "- "Sure is id?" interrupted Pat, hotly, "if 'twas me own nmither, I couldn't be more sure, Didn't I see him with me two eyes lave the yard with his fist full of clothes; he slipped out of me sighlt,-the rascal,-an' thin the dog was asthray, and not a sight of him has re- joiced the missus' eye till now; when I sees  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7402-00000150"/> 296      Roy's Search. him sittin' there as cool and comfortable like as if he was in his missus' parlor: bad luck to the baste, an ungrateful animal it is!" and Pat rubbed his shins, and scowled at Carlo, who slipped around to Roy, and stood as if uncer- tain whether to assault Pat or the officer. Pat turned his attention once more to cap- turing him. He tried coaxing, but Carlo was not to be caught by "blarney," and to all overtures sniffed his nose in dogged disgust, and snapped slyly at the approaching hand. "I  did not steal the dog, sir," said Roy, looking up into the officer's face. That worthy was puzzled, for many a time on his rounds he had seen Roy, and his practiced eye had often contrasted him favor. ably with other members of the boot-black *craft. "How  then did you come   by him?" he asked. /i   Pat, Police, and Palcazing.    297 Roy rapidly narrated the circumstances, his story being interrupted by various ironical re- joinders from the impatient Irishman. "Is id sich a rigmarole ye'd be telling sensi- ble payple?" he said, when Roy had con- cluded. "You can ask the conductor of the train I came in," continued lby. "Conductor, indade!" cried the irate Hiber- nian, "maybe he'd say yez didn't take  the missus' clothes from the line? Och, Misther Officer, dear, don't be botherin' wid his non- since; the missus 'll prove it to your honor, when he's locked up safe,-the raskil!" The energetic son of Erin,-feeling sure he was on- the right track, and was doing his mistress good service,-was so positive and persistent, that the policeman, against his own wishes, told Roy lie should be obliged to arrest him.

If Roy resigned himself to his fate, Carlo certainly did not; he bit furiously, and whined dolorously; struggling desperately to follow his young master; but Pat was quite as obstinate, and much stronger than he, and before long had the refractory dog by the collar, and, clapping him under. his arm, trotted out of sight. Poor Roy, the tears rolled down his cheeks, -as  he walked beside the bright-buttoned official. Carlo was gone! That was a bitter drop in the cup of sorrow placed to his young " lips. A  few days before, Roy had seen a convict, in charge of an officer, passing through the streets of the city. The horribly colored gar- ments, and dejected appearance of the criminal, had  wrought upon  Roy's susceptible heart. The sad, eager, yet hopeless expression of his restless eye, made  Roy pity him,  and lhe   Pat, Police, and Patching.   299 followed on after for a long distance. He wished that he had some little gift to slip into the felon's hand,-a token that somebody in the world had a fellow feeling for him. Now, the figure of the convict came forcibly to mind, and in imagination he saw himself clothed in the degrading costume, an outcast, with none, to plead his cause and- rescue him from im- prisonment. Would he spend his life in prison? Would his mother ever think of looking there for him? His heart seemed swelled to bursting; he felt as if a nightmare weight were upon him. He wanted to scream  out to the people whom he passed, "I am innocent,-save me! I want to find my mother!" Meanwhile the officer was revolving several points. The ragged, but bright-faced lad, ac- companied always by his canine friend, had, as we have said, won golden opinions from, the  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7402-00000152"/> ,uu     z0oy's Search.  shrewd, observing man. Roy was never in- volved in any street scrape, was always at his post, and polite and business-like, used no bad language, and, above all, never offended the  worthy man's dignity by calling him "Old Nab'em," and the various nicknames which saucy urchins, big and small, were fond of using -within the constable's hearing, taking to  heel before he could use his rattan. Was i  right to arrest such a good boy on the word of a stray Irishman? He had left no clue to the  address of the person who had owned the dog, might not the whole be a trick to get pos- session of the animal? Not sorry to find such "flaws" in the case, he turned to Roy and said: "Well, my  lad, I guess you may run back  now."  "Sir? am I   not going to jail?" cried Roy,  breathlessly.   Pat, Police, and Patczitg.    30I "I guess we'll settle; that point another day," was the brief reply. The boy's face flushed, he tried to speak his thanks, but the words choked him. "Never mind, I'll give you a job on my boots sometimes; get precious dirty this weather !" said the good-natured official, and with a lightened heart Roy retraced his steps. "If dear old Carlo were only here!" he thought, " but what is the use of fretting.  I ought to be glad to get back to my' establish- ment' again!" But on arriving at his stand, to his utter dismay, he found    everything gone!    He hunted, but not a trace of his blacking tools could he find, and not a neighboring boot- black was to be seen, of whom to make in- quiries, an unusual circumstance at that hour of the day. "They have stolen it!" and Roy sat down,   &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7402-00000153"/> 302      Roy 's Search. ready to cry again. His only dependence was lost, and he lmew enough of the boys to be sure that he should never see it again. How could he earn his daily bread? For a short time our hero was in the depths of despair- alone, his business taken from him! How he longed for faithful Carlo's unaffected though speechless sympatlhy! But, happily, Roy was not given to " crying over spilt milk," and his active brain speedily began to- devise plans for bettering his fortunes. He turned. his pockets inside out, examined the l{nings of his coat, an-d was rewarded for . his search by just twenty cents. "Rather small capital to commence busi- ness," he said solemnly, as he walked to his lodgings, "but you've been worse off, old fellow; just go ahead, and you'll find some- thing to do. Boston is a big place!" He first set about makincg himself presenta-   Pat, Police, and Patching.    303 ble. He washed his hands and face till the icy water made them glow, and ran a rake of a comb through his curly locks, but still he was dissatisfied. "Rag-tag and bob-tail!"' lhe quoted. "I must look better than this before I go hunting for a place.  These things ought to be mended; this flap is almost off,-it's a wonder I hadn't stepped upon it-Land these pants are frayed out shamefully. Wliat shall I do?" It was fideed a problem hard to solve; the gaSrments were really unfit for an aspiring young man to seek hs fortune in, and for a time Roy shook his, curls dolefully; but a bright thlought came to his rescue, and-he sprang to his feet, exclaiming: "That's it! I'll mend them myself. Guess boys can sew as well as girls. I'll buy a needle and see-if I can't!" , He hurried down the rickety stairs, 'quite  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7402-00000154"/> 304      Roy's Search. elevated, and running to a little shop kept- by an old German, asked for needles. "Vat needles?" asked the proprietor, who spent so much time patronizing a portion of his stock kept behind a calico curtain, in a corner of the room, that his "intellects" wero not the most acute. Roy did not exactly know how large a one he needed, but selected a darning-needle, as it corresponded with the size of the garment he was to patcil, and hurrying back, seated him- self at 'his task. There was a bunch of white cotton lying on the floor. " That will do," he said, picking it up. He laid the coat carefully across his knees, and extricating a needleful from the tangled mass, proceeded to thread the needle. It took him some time, as his fingers were numb with cold, but perseverance accomplished it, and laying the flap in its place, he commenced.   Pat, Police, and Patching.    3o05 Thrusting the huge needle vigorously in, he fairly screamed with pain, as he sent it into his thumb. A sad job that mending was to Roy. The ugly needle would be refractory and refuse to go through the cloth; then if he drove it, his fingers would be sadly pricked, by way of revenge. "There," he said, at last, drawing a long sigh, "that coat will have to do! I pity the girls if they have to sew all day, that's all!" He decided to "let his pants go," as they would not show much, and try to find some- thing to do directly.  The afternoon was quite mild, and the streets were thronged with purchasers, for the holidays were just at hand, and business was brisk. Despite his improved appearance, Roy hesitated long before he could summon courage to enter any of the elegant stores. But a thought of his desperate condition emboldened 20  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7402-00000155"/> 306     Roy's Search. him, and opening the door of the one nearest at hand, he inquired: "Do you wish a boy, sir? "No," was the gruff reply from behind a huge book, and Roy walked out. He had tried a long line of stores, receiving invariably the same answer, if any, for the busy shop- keepers and clerks did not always spare time to answer the question so modestly put by the oddly dressed little applicant. He was quite discouraged, when he came across a boy a few years older than himself. "Looking for a place?" inquired the other, scanning him from head to foot. "Yes," answered Roy. "I happen to know where they want one," said the stranger, "and if you do not mind walking a piece, it'll pay you well!" "Where fs it?" asked Roy, his face glowing with joy. "I'm ever so much obliged to you."   Pat, Police, and Patchzing.  307 The boy directed him to the place, and, thanking him, Roy started. A long walk it was, but the boy heeded not his aching limbs- was he not almost sure of employment? His mind was full of schemes as to what he should do when a salaried clerk. "I'll buy a suit of clothes at once," he thought, " and have a hot dinner every day. Wont it be grand?" This castle-building, however, was suddenly terminated as he reached his destination. "I heard you wanted a boy, sir," he said, brightly, to the proprietor. "Who told you that?" asked the man, sharply. Roy related his meeting the strange boy. The man burst into a loud laugh. "Green as if you grew this year!" he cried. "I want no boy, much less a little scare-crow  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7402-00000156"/> 308      Roy's Search. like you,-the style of your garments wouldn't suit us here!" Roy waited to hear no more, but made his way out of the store as fast as possible, amid the laughter and jests of the clerks. "That boy was real mean, and the man was no better," he cried, indignantly, the hot blood rushing into his cheeks at the insults he had received. His air-castles had been tottled over by rude hands, and he had the prospect of a long walk home, after dark, for his trouble. Sadly he mounted the steep flights that led to his room, and entering, threw himself upon the wretched bed. He had eaten nothing since morning, but the faintness at his stom- ach, and the chilly room, were trifles compared with the great disappointment of the after- noon.  "Everything goes hard with me," said he,   Pat, Police, and Patching.   309 despondingly. "What shall I do if I cannot get a place this winter? It is almost time to paiy my rent, and if I do not I shall be turned' out of doors, and shall freeze to death in the streets." The bed was damp and cold, and he lay shivering for long hours,.thinking and plan- ning for the morrow, and it was nearly mid- night before he fell asleep. He was indeed in a deplorable condition. Carlo, his faithful friend, was gone; of all his treasures none remained save his mother's Bible, but with that, who could say he was all alone? Roy's thoughts turned towards his Bible when he awoke the next morning. "Good Miss Horton told me to put my trust in God, and I should be taken care of," he said, " and I believe her." After reading a chapter, and offering a siam-  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7402-00000157"/> 3 o      Roy's Search. ple but fervent prayer, for he felt that in this extremity he had no one but his Heavenly Fa. ther of whom to ask help,--he went out and bought a baker's roll, which, with a draught of water, made his scanty meal. "I'll try old Boston - again!" he said, with 'new courage. But the close of the day found him more disheartened than ever. "My clothes prevent me from getting a place, he said, bursting into tears, as he en- tered  his attic, hungry and tired. "How cruel in those men to make fun of me! Would not I wear better if I could?

But all are not so heartless as those   Pat, Police, and Patching.  31i who derided you. God grant that you may see this before long! Two days passed, and Roy was still unsuc- cessful. With the strictest economy, the twenty cents had bought food enough to keep him from starving, but with the keen appetite the cold winds brought, he had suffered from the pangs of unsatisfied hunger. Meanwhile rent day was approaching, the landlady had given him several hints about being ready, and Roy grew old with worry and disappointment.

COLD, hungry, and ragged was our friend Roy, as he stood looking in a famous bake-shop in Boston. His little cold nose was flattened against the great window pane, his blue fingers were thrust into the edge of the pockets of Bob's old coat, and his bare toes just touched the frosty pavement as he stretched up, gazing wistfully at the temptingly arrayed "goodies." Within, John, the baker's boy, was busily dealing out hot loaves and crisp, fresh-looking cakes to the crowd of customers. "Oh, aren't those cakes jolly!" cried Roy, in his delight forgetting himself and speaking   A Victoory, and a Discovery. 313 aloud. "Wouldn't I like to be a baker's boy-! Oh my! see the fellow cram down the ginger- bread! If it was only me!" and Roy made a feeble attempt at some gymnastic feat, in an- ticipation, but his poor legs were too-weak, and he put his face to the window again. He was so engaged talking to himself that lie did not notice the mirth of a little old man standing in the shadow  near by, almost hidden in a huge overcoat and a large fur cap. "O dear," sighed Roy, as he saw a servant loading a basket. Don't I wish I had that full! Why, I should not be hungry for a long time. If I only had plenty to eat, I think I wouldn't mind anything else;" and he took his pinched nose away from the window to watch the servant and basket descend the steps. Just then, a portly man with a market-basket on his arm, came puffing clumsily up, and run-  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7402-00000159"/> 3 4     Roy's Search. ning against the servant, upset the latter's basket and nearly capsized its bearer. "I'll teach you better manners, you great lumbering elephant!" furiously cried the ser- vant, as he picked up his scattered purchases. "Ho, ho!" replied the great man, good-na- turedly, "nearly put an end to ye, hey? Well, don't lose your temper!" "'Lose my temper'?" exclaimed the other, fiercely; "you'll pay for that!" and he rushed after him into the shop. Roy was a highly amused witness of the scene, and, boy-like, was giggling " all to him- self" by the large window, when he caught sight of something white on the pavement, and with a cry of joy picked it up. "If it isn't a whopping big loaf of bread, warm as an oven too,--wont I have a feast!" and the famishing child almost danced for joy. Instantly, however, his countenance fell, and   A  Victory, and a Discovery. 3 5 he looked stealthily around. He had been well taught by good Mrs. Horton. He was a Christian boy, with Christian principles. But a great struggle was going on in his heart just then. The right triumphed, and with a smothered sob, and a very determined look, he went bravely in where the wrathful servant and the fat man were still disputing. "Here," said he, pulling the servant by the sleeve, "is a loaf of bread that you dropped." "My bread,-you  young rascal!" he re- joined, glad to vent his spite on some one, "how much have you stolen besides?" "For shame!" said the corpulent gentle- man. "That's all the thanks I get for doing right," murmured Roy, as he trudged hungrily and sorrowfully along the street. Suddenly there was a quick step behind him, anti a hand was laid upon his shoulder.

"Well, my little man," said the stranger, softly, "why did you not eat the loaf of bread you found?" Roy turned very red, and the merry old man burst into a fit of laughter. "Ah, you did not think somebody was look- ing at you all the time," he continued, with a chuckle, adding gravely, "I saw it all, and it's lucky you did not yield to the temptation; all my plans would then have been upset, for if there's anybody I'm down on it is a thief." "I hope I shall never do so again," return- ed Roy, confusedly. "I'll risk you!" said the man;" you're honest to the core, or my name isn't Nicholas Grum!" Roy started.

Everything is whirling around ;" and he would have fallen, but Mr. Grum caught him. Glancing at Roy's deathh- like face, a change came over his also. "Strange, strange!" he murmured. A coach was passing, and at a vigorous shout from the energetic Mr. Grum, it stopped, and he bore Roy into the vehicle. "Where shall I take you?" asked the coach- man, and Roy, supposing he was the one ad- dressed, said faintly:  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7402-00000161"/> 318     Roy's Search .

"Don't talk, my dear boy," as Roy remon- strated at being so much trouble, "just lean back, and take it easy." There was silence for a moment, and then Mr. Grum broke it by saying: "Did you say you hadn't any place to go to? Where then do you live?" "I've lived on the street the last two days," replied Roy, sadly. "The old woman I hired a room of turned me out of doors yesterday morning, because I couldn't pay her." "And where did you sleep last night?" "I stayed in the depot till the man said I couldn't stay any longer, then I found an old freight car and laid down in that, but it was so cold I couldn't sleep "- -   A Victory, and a Discovery. 319      ; "Well, what then?" "I walked and beat my arms about to keep from freezing,-that's the way the coachmen do, you know, sir." "Why did not you come to me?" cried Mr. Grum, blowing his nose with great vigor as he spoke. "Why, sir, don't you remember you sent me out of the store?" asked Eoy, timidly. "Yes, yes," assented the old gentleman. "I have an indistinct remembrance of being a big fool about that time; but you shall be re- venged. We'll talk more about that by-and- by," said he, as the coach stopped, "for here we are at my ' bachelor's hall' 1" Roy scarcely believed himself awake as Nicholas Grum led him up the massive steps, and taking a key from his vest pocket, un- locked and opened the heavy door, on which was a silver plate bearing his name in full.  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7402-00000162"/> 320      Roy's Search.         I The long, dimly-lighted hall, brightened here and there by pictures and statuary; the stately library with its high book-cases; the soft car- pets that gave back no sound to the pressure of his dripping torn shoe, and the luxurious arm-chair that Mr. Grum placed for him be- fore the cheerful grate,-fairly bewildered him. It was as if an angel had caught him from the depths of poverty, hunger and cold, and had borne him into some fairy palace; and as he gazed around the room, glowing with the soft light from the fire, Roy thought he was dream- ing. He was almost afraid to breathe for fear he should dispel the sweet illusion, and wake to shiver and hunger again.

"How do you feel now-?" he asked, looking at him closely for the first time since he had entered the apartment. ".Oh, so comfortable, sir, thank you!" "Comfortable!" cried the old gentleman, jumping up again, " how can you be comforta- ble? What a pair of shoes, and what a coat! and your pants,-what did possess you to wear those?" "They are the best I have," replied Roy, ruefully, "and I wish I had more' of them, the weather is so cold!"

Why, my boy, I did not sleep a-thinking of you." ': Perhaps God put it into your heart," sug- gested Roy, tremulously, after a moment. "Stuff and nonsense!" exclaimed Mr. Grum, his nose troubling him again. "I deserved to think of you, you young rascal! Why did you not haunt me day and night?" They were interrupted by the entrance of a servant with supper. "After this young gentleman has dined, Par- ker," said Mr. Grum, "I wish to confer with you about him."  \ The man was too   trained to show any surprise at the strange visitor, but Roy felt ill at ease before the genteely clad, quiet, obse- quious servant.

He was so hungry it took his utmost self-con- trol to eat with decorum, and the active, bright- eyed little man opposite was so taken up watching him that he left his own supper un- heeded. "Parker," he suddenly inquired, " who does my young friend resemble? I never can look at him without being strangely puzzled." "I have noticed it myself, sir," he answered; "it is queer, but his expression is slightly like yours."' Mr. Grum burst into a hearty laugh. "Not much of a compliment that to you," lie cried, speaking to Roy. "The best in the world, sir!" promptly re- plied Roy, with his mouth full of chicken and jelly. This well-turned answer was readily appre-  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7402-00000164"/> 324     Roy's Search. ciated by the old gentleman, who was in high humor. Supper being disposed of, Mr. Grum took Parker aside and had a long talk with him. "I shall now turn you over to the tender mercies of Parker," said Mr. Grum. The gray-haired servant conducted him to a bath-room, and after explaining the mode of obtaining hot and cold water, left the boy to himself, returning in a short time with every article of dress that the lad could want at once. Under his skilful fingers Roy came out thoroughly renovated, and feeling as much better inside for the agreeable change, as his outward appearance was improved. "As well dressed a young gentleman as could be seen in Boston," observed Parker, politely, and Roy felt the worth of the compli- ment, coming as it did from such a source. Parker conducted Roy to Mr. Grum as   A  Victory, and a Discovery.  325 carefully as if he had been some work of art and lie the artist. "Really," exclaimed -Mr. Grum, after surveying the blushing boy, "you have, as usual, done yourself credit, Parker!"

"I have a plan for you, and if we can agree I will call it square." "What is that, sir?" "I will take you into my store. I want just such an honest boy as you, and if you have a taste for mercantile life you shall have a chance to rise." "Oh, that is too much!" exclaimed Roy, as soon as he could get his breath.  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7402-00000165"/> 326      Roy's Searchn "Wait a moment," said Mr. Grum. "I shall also require you to board with me"- "In this beautiful place?" "Yes, if you like the job of being tied up to an old rheumatic, notional body, and being scolded by him from morning till night." "I guess I deserve the scolding," said Roy. "I've tested you," returned the old man, laying his hand on his head, "you are pure gold." . Roy could not reply. The tears filled his eyes, and Nicholas Grum, gazing into the depths-misty and humid--saw   something that brought back some sad remembrance, for he turned away, and the boy heard something like a sigh escape his benefactor. A downy bed, like driven snow, lulled the tired boy to sleep that night. It was late the nexst morning before he awoke, and then he lay peaceful and happy, filled with a restful   A   Victory, and a Discovery. 327 feeling that he had not known for many a long day. "It is too good to be true!" he murmured. "Miss Horton told the truth when she said God would take care of me, if I trusted in him. He has! He has-!"

"It is almost ten o'clock," he said, politely. "So late?" cried Roy, "how could I sleep so!" ' "It was natural," returned the old servant, "after your long-exposure.

The ample dining-room, and Parker behind his chair, quite abashed Roy, but the gray- haired man was a true servant, in the old- fashioned sense of the word, when servants were more companions than menials. He had grown old in the service, and without any home or family ties of his own, his heart was bound up in his master. Mr. Grum's favorites were Parker's favorites, therefore Roy's little' blunders in table etiquette were looked upon with lenient eyes. "You are to amuse yourself this forenoon," he said, as Roy arose. "Mr. Grum says you are not yet fit-to go into the store." After showing him the library, and giving him the key to the book-cases, the servant departed. A happy forenoon was that to Roy. Lying at full length on the soft fleecy   Ai Victory, and a Discovery.  329 rug before the fire, he fairly revelled in books. Mr. Grum coming suddenly upon him found him, flushed and rosy, thus occupied. "Hey day! we shall have you in a fever," hle cried, gayly. " y work is done, and you must amuse me the rest of the day. Here, you young rascal, get me my slippers from that closet!" Roy sprang to obey, bringing the scarlet gown at the same time. "If you please, sir, lMrs. Briggs wishes to see you," said Parker, putting his head in at the door. "Show her in." A moment more, and the door opened again and a fat lady appeared. "Bless me, Nicholas, I'm all out of breath! Just come from your store." Roy heard this, but nothing more, for he caught sight of a little black figure,-follow- : t:  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7402-00000167"/> 3 3o     Roy's Search. ing the huge form of the lady, with a drooping, disconsolate expression in his whole bearing, and he uttered a cry of delight. A quick joy- ful bark, and the figure sprang forward. It was the long-lost Carlo! The two were oblivious of everything. Carlo seemed trying his best to devour his little master, yelping and whin- ing in very excess of joy. Roy, with his arms thrown about the dog's glossy neck, sobbed as if he were crazy, while Mr. Grum and the obese lady looked on silently in astonish- ment. "Well, I declare!" she ejaculated, when the tumult had subsided, " what does this mean-- wrho is this boy, Nicholas?" "A protege of mine," answered he, in an un- dertone; then aloud, " you seem to have found an old friend, my boy?"

"Know?" cried Mr. Grum, impatiently, rub- bing his bald head with his right hand, " don't I know the boy to be as honest as "- "Well, well, I dare say," said his visitor, "there is no need of putting yourself out of temper, as I can see.

"Oh, indeed!" exclaimed Mr. Grum, sarcas- tically, "didn't you offer a reward for the re- covery of Carlo?" "Well, yes, I  did," replied Mrs. Briggs, reflectively, " was there anything wrong in that? I gave it to Mike, of course." Mr. Grum burst into a hearty laugh.   ,A 'ictory, and a Discovery.   333 "Very disinterested of him !" he said. " Roy has been accused, and came near being sent to jail for stealing, and the question is,-did you or anybody else see him do it ?" "It is all a mistake," said MIrs. Briggs, "and I am very sorry, and to make restitution I will give the dog to Roy, as you call him." "To keep?" cried Roy. "Certainly." A few shrewd questions from Mr. Grum put the matter in the right light, and the fat lady was sincerely sorry for the trouble it had- caused the boy. "It all came of that pig-headed Irishman !" Mr. Grum observed, savagely, and it was for- tunate for the blundering son of Erin.that he was not near for the old gentleman to vent his spleen upon. "It is strange how our family have become mixed up with that boy," Mr. Grumn said, as  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7402-00000169"/> 334      Roy's Search.  he paced the floor, after Roy had gone to bed. "I abused him first, and then my sister, through her servant. Strange!" On his way to bed he stole into Roy'l apartment. The boy was sleeping peacefully, his dark curls framing a happy face, the rosy lips parted as if about to speak. On a soft rug lay Carlo, who opened a pair of bright eyes and tapped the carpet with his tail as if he knew the wmaster was no intruder. Mr. Grum gazed long and earnestly, and then, with a murmured blessing, turned to go, but his at- tention was arrested by the Bible and amnbro- type lying on a light-stand near by.

The mysterious bond of sympathy between them was now explained, and the old man held fast Roy's hand as if afraid to lose him, his tones as tender as a woman-'s, as they conversed of the past.

It was a sad voice that uttered this, and a sad, queer figure was Dark, the colored girl, that merry Christmas Eve, as she crouched on the steps of a palatial residence in the great city. A rag of a shawl was drawn over her slight, shivering shoulders, her stockingless feet were thrust into mammoth shoes cast off by some sturdy day-laborer, and round her crisp-curled hair was wound,-her special pride,--a strip of red handkerchief that she had picked up. Altogether poor Dark made a pitiable and ludicrous appearance.

"If you don't bleeve it, you'll get the taste of my boots!" Dark, overcome by the presence of the great man, or the approach of the menacing leather, moved away as fast as her shoes would permit.

Down the street hurried a burly, ill-visaged woman, half carrying, half dragging an ele- gantly dressed child of some seven years. "Oh! Oh!" screamed the child, " let me go, let me go!" "Shut up, I tell you!" growled the woman, "or I'll knock your teeth in with a big stone." The child's cries grew faint in the distance, and still Dark stood rooted to the spot. The whole truth flashed itself upon her. The child nad been stolen. "Poor thing!" exclaimed Dark. "I'll just follow the old thing and see if I can't help you;" and she swiftly darted after the couple.

Dark seemed to know the house well, and slipping in at the half open door, crept softly up the long rickety flights of stairs, stopped at a door, sank on her knees, and peeped through the key-hole. "O don't, please," pleaded the child, within. "Take me liome, and my new mother'll give you lots of money." "tHold yer tongue, or I'll take it out of your head," threatened the woman, as she roughly stripped the child of her costly garments, and unclasped a slender gold chain from her neck.

It was some time before the wise little African thought prudent to venture back and resume her watch at the key-hole. All was still in the room, and she could hear nothing from her stand, so she applied her ear to the aperture, and heard a heavy breathing. Dark's hour for action had come. But do you wonder her heart beat almost to suffoca- tion, and  her knees trembled so she could scarcely stand as she softly lifted the latch?. She had never been taught to pray, but it was almost a   prayer she breathed as she glanced in.  The old hag lay across a heap of straw, asleep, and kneeling at her feet was the kidnapped girl, the  tears running down her fair cheeks, her hands clasped, and her lips softly moving.

Dark bent forward and peered long and      -  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7402-00000175"/> 346      Roy's Search. searchingly into Lucy's face. A smile broke over her face at last, and she uttered an excla- mation of wonder. "Ha! ha!" interrupted a rough voice close by. Both children started with a shriek, but old Sal sprang forward, and clutched them fiercely.' Dark struggled and bit furiously, cry- ing " murder " at the top of her lungs. "What's the row here?" said a heavy voice, "and the portly form of a watchman appeared. Old Sal attempted to run, but he caught her by the arm, exclaiming, "All, I've found you again!" ^   - X TTT. NZlts of Hog. CHRISTMAS dawned clear and bright. That jolly old saint who fills the chil-. dren's stockings had done his part, as usual, and in many houses the bells of joy were ringing in young hearts. But no one was happier than Dark on that morning. The weary wanderer had found a home-a loving Christian home with the little girl she had res- cued. "Spec you and me is gwine to ride to-day!" she said to Lucy, as she danced into the room where the maid was dressing the latter. "How do you know that?" dignifiedly in- quired Lucy.  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7402-00000176"/> 348     Roy's Search  "Oh, me an' missus been speculatin 'bout  it," she answered, looking very knowing; last night I an' Mister and Miss Gordon talked de matter over, and we 'cluded 'twould do your health good to take an airing in de big sleigh dis fine day. Ky, won't it be grand! Where do you spose yous'e gwine?" "Oh, I'm sure I don't know." "Tink you might guess." "Why, how could I?" asked Lucy. "What you been praying for dis long time? Didn't you spec to be heard?  If I was as good as you, now, I'd spec de Lord 'ud hear -me de fust minute. Dar! I forgot, Miss Gor- don she say I musn't tell you anything about it,-she's gwine to sprize yer!" "A great surprise it will be if you don't ' hold your tongue!" added the maid, laughing, as Dark darted out of the room in answer to Mrs. Gordon's call. ,.                    Bells of yoy.      349 "Lucy, dear," said Mrs. Gordon, kissing her with unusual tenderness, as she entered the room, then folding her in her arms and gazing long into her face, "wvould you really like to leave me and go back to your sister Mattie, if you knew Tlwhere she was ?" "I love you," answered Lucy, clinging around her neck, "but I want to see Mattie, and Willie, and Johnnie." "It is natural," sighed Mrs. Gordon, "it is natural; and it would be wrong to wish it otherwise, hard as it is to give her up !"-- "Do you know where my Mattie is?" in- terrupted Lucy, trembling with excitement. "We have been questioning     Dark about you. She says she knows where your father lives, and we have no reason to doubt her account. Mr. Gordon has proposed that we do not delay the matter, but this very day take you to your own home, and then if you wish  &#xD;<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC7402-00000177"/> 350      Roy's Search. to return with me for a shorter or longer time I should be glad to have you. - You can act as you choose, with the consent of your parents." But while the horses are being harnessed, let us glance for a moment into the house of the Williams's. The demon Intemperance has long since been dethroned, and his empire of poverty, thriftlessness,- violence and sorrow, has given place to thrift, plenty, love and peace. What a change! Would you think it?  This room, so pleasant, tastefully furnished, adorned with books and pictures, is the very one where, hovering over the cracked and smoking stove, the ill-clad and hungry little company of children, headed by Martha, with persecuted Dark for their guest, took counsel together how to improve their gloomy lot. A bountiful Christmas dinner is smoking on the table. Do you recognize the gentleman   Bells of 7qoy.     35i -, o---- oO---- sitting at the head? A fine open brow, clear eye, frank countenance-but hush! he is say- ing grace. How, mellow the tones--tender, reverential, trusting, and so grateful! You never saw him? It is Mr. Williams. Was he not worth saving from the drunkard's life or. death? The lady opposite- "Is his second wife?" Not so fast! It is Mrs. Williams ;-she of the "restless, luminous eyes," and "striking though faded beauty;"Mrs. Sprague's strange caller, whose feminine sensibilities and ex- quisitely attuned nature were overborne in the engulfing horrors turned upon the household by the rum-fiend, and who in a fit of temporary insanity thus induced came near destroying her own  children. The frenzy, however, quickly passed, aided by rest and medicine, and her gentle and womanly qualities in their normal sweetness and  symmetry resuming  &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7402-00000178"/> 352      Roy's Search. their sway, fitting her to preside loving and loved in the restored home-circle. "A superior woman!" "She is indeed!" Her husband is doing nicely as bookkeeper in a neighboring paper-mill-a situation ob- tained for him by Dr. Osgood. "Oh, father, isn't this turkey gay!" cries Johnnie; "aren't we happy?" "We are certainly happier than in the past," was the reply. "I should be perfectly satisfied," says Martha, softly, "if dear little Lucy was with us!" Mr. Williams' face grew grave, and the meal was finished in silence. As they were rising from the table, Mr. Williams said: "God has been wonderfully good to us, children; let us thank him, and pray that, if it   Bells of yoy.      353 is his will, the dear child may be speedily restored to us!" They had just risen from their knees, when Johnnie, whose bright' eyes were always on the alert, exclaimed: "Oh, what an elegant carriage!" A large sleigh drawn by a span of white horses was dashing up the street. "They're coming here!" said Mrs. Williams, in surprise. The coachman drove to the gate witlh an artistic flourish, and a few moments later Lucy was in her sister /lattie's arms. IWhat a tumult of questions and answers followed. "Dis nigger don't forget when folks is good to her!" cried Dark, her splendid eyes and black face shining from exuberance of delight. "'Twas me dat brought Lucy back!" "Yes, you may thank -Dark for it," stid 23  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7402-00000179"/> 534      Roy's Search. Mrs. Gordon, smiling through her tears. "She and Lucy have been half wild all the way out, and I confess I was hardly less anx- ious to see the dear child's relatives." Martha was pressing Lucy to her as if she feared to lose her. Her rich dress and warm furs told of the kind care her benefactors had bestowed, and Martha quite pitied the lady as she saw what a struggle it cost her to give up the child. Lucy seemed to forget that her father was the cause of her long absence, but looked up -:)  into his face, marvelling at the strong emotion that shook his frame as he took her up. "Are you glad I've come, father?" she asked, soberly. "Very, very glad, darling!" was the tremu- lous answer, and Lucy was satisfied. "Now I must see Willie," she said, after she had kissed every one in the room.   Bells of Joy.     355  l There was a deep hush, and Mrs. Williams, drawing the flushed, eager child to her, said tenderly: "You'll never see Willie again, dear,-he is gone to heaven!" Lucy understood it in a moment, and bury- ing her face in her mother's bosom, sobbed heart-brokenly: "Darling Willie! I want to see Willie!' "Willie is very happy, dear Lucy," said Martha, weeping. "Oh, husband," said Mrs. Williams, " if baby was here, what could we ask more? How strange that through these long years we have found no trace of the sweet child! Willie is with Jesus-but where, oh where is the lost lamb? But what ails our little colored friend?" she abruptly 'exclaimed, addressing Dark, who, with handkerchief stuffed in her mouth,:eyes rolled up, and sides shaking, appeared to be $   &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7402-00000180"/> 356     Roys Search. going into convulsions. "Are you sick, dear?" "-He! he! he!" giggled the animated piece of ebony, whizzing top-like about the apart- ment. '- Ky! I hear um!" she cried, and in the most astonishing manner, without answer- ing Mrs. Williams's inquiries, whirled out of doors and in an instant sat perched on the front fence, the bits of blue, red and yellow ribbon with which shelo had tied up her snugly clinging curlets fluttering their commingling hues on the breeze. A  moment more and a  second sleigh, as. notable as the first, reined in before the Wil- liamses. "Who can  they be?" soliloquized  Mrs. Williams, as she glanced at the team. "Can you not tell?" answered Mrs. Gordon, gliding to her side and encircling her waist with a loving arm. A little old man, thoroughly bundled up, and   Bells of .oy.      357 a genteely dressed, bright-faced lad were stepping from the vehicle. "It seems to me," added Mrs. Gordon, with emotion, "that that benevolent-looking old gentleman and noble-browed boy strikingly resemble a certain lady not far from me," and she gazed suggestively into Mrs. Williams' eyes. The latter grew agitated, became deathly pale, and sinking into a chair, faintly repeated, her face radiant with a great joy: "Father! Roy! happy! happy!" Scarcely had the white lips murmured these touching words, when brisk Nicholas Grum, fairly running in, threw an arm about her, ejaculating :"Daughter-! daughter!" Wlhile Roy, equally impetuous, was alter- nately kissing her and crying, exclaiming: "Dear, dear mother, I've found you. Oh, how long I have hunted for you!"  &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7402-00000181"/> O358     Roy's Search. "And I for you, darling!" Meanwhile Dark giggled, frolicked, attitu- denized, throwing her rapidly varying features into inimitable contortions, vainly endeavoring to illustrate her delight, her double row of ivories in a perpetual gleam as she reiterated: "'Twas dis chile dat brung it 'bout, 'an dat's de truf! I tole Massa Grum I knowed 'twas his kin an' Roy's;--spec dis nig'll hab good times now!" It was true, as she said.  Meeting Roy often on her errands, her keen eyes detected a  resemblance between him and little Willie, whom she so well remembered, and she did not let the grass grow under her now neatly- clad feet till she had learned enough of Roys history to confirm her interesting inference; then hearing that Nicholas Grum was Roy's grandfather, and what in a confidential mood, Mr. Grum had confessed to Roy, that in a fit   Bells of )oy.     359 of passion, from motives of family pride, he had discarded his only daughter for marrying against his wishes, and that now he mourned for her with a consuming and remorseful grief,-putting these facts together, she told Mrs. Gordon her discovery, the issue being an arrangement between Mr. and Mrs. Gordon and Mr. Grum to. give the Williamses a glad surprise. "Mr. Williams," said the quick-spoken old man, cordially extending his hand to the for- mer, "I was a senseless brute. - I thought my daughter too good for anybody, and I treated you like a dog. If I hadn't been an opinion- ated old goose I should have encouraged and helped you in your married life, instead of being offended. It was my lack of a just ap- preciation of you, and unkindness, that drove you into discouragement and drink. Don't interrupt me-I know all about it. Many a  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7402-00000182"/> strong and worthy man has been cast down in  just the way you were. It's the same old .  story of pride of blood, family bigotry, born of  ignorance and self-conceit, sir, as stupid as it  is mean, leading people in their blind folly to regard the stranger marrying into the family as an inferior and an interloper. Well, if you  have suffered, so have Hand I deserved to. Hereafter if you want anything of me I am at your service, sure as my name is Nicholas Grum!"' A  speech of miraculous length for him, en- forced by certain very characteristic gestures, not taught by elocutionists,--consisting of al- ternate eyes-wiping and nose-blowing, for not only the latter but the former were easily affected of late, symptomatic not of "cold in the head," but of warmth in the heart.

The commodious old farm- house and out-grounds remained unchanged, save that-the pinks blooming on each side of the gravelled walk when he first trod it, were now under the snow. On the front door still  hung the massive brass knocker-how familiar it looked! Recalling Jed's memorable words on the occasion of his return with ,ioy, " Now for a rouser!" Roy, catching his spirit, plied the ponderous rapper with a will. " Now, Jed," said a motherly voice within, as Mrs. Sprague, in response to the summons, proceeded to open the door, "you needn't try to deceive me. That's your knock, I can tell it from "- "Why!" she exclaimed, interrupting her cdoating words as she saw the young caller, " I thought Jed was into mischief." "Is Mr. Jedediah Sprague, Jr., at home ?" inquired Boy, averting his face. &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7402-00000183"/> 362'     Roy's Search. "He's about the house somewhere," was the reply. Wont you walk in?"And she showed him into the parlor, where sat her hopeful, clad in his best coat and pants; and,-althoug!l it * was winter,-a white vest. "Are you the parson?" asked Roy, his cap unremoved and drawn to shade his eyes. Roy had not forgotten how Jed liked to be taken for that functionary, and that he had not wholly overcome the amiable weakness the oddly pretentious bearing he promptly assum- ed clearly indicated. "No, young   man," he patronizingly re- sponded, "I do not exactly serve the inhabi- tants of this small town in that capacity, though perhaps 'they might go farther and fare worse,' as the poet says :" forgetting his dignity ere the close of the quotation, and favoring his questioner with a confirmatory wink. "Myname is Jede"-   Bells of  3oy.    363 "Precisely," interposed Roy; "how about that 'perpetual motion clock' that you en- gaged to take?" "Look here, youngster," replied Jed, grow- ing red and wrathy, "if you've come here for them villanous skinflints, thinking to "- "Jed," cried Roy, tossing his cap aside, "don't you know me, you dear old fellow?" "oy!"roared his fiery-laired friend, seiz- ing him with his great freckled paw, and then hugging him bearishy, "I would as soon have thought of seeing Nebuchadnezzar's aunt. When did you rain down?" Then striding rapidly into the hall he shouted: "Dad! marm! where are ye? hurry up your cakes! Roy's arrived! Roy's here!" How the trio laughed and cried as Roy re- lated his eventful history since he left the Sprague's! and as he and Jed at parting treat- ed themselves to a second hug, Roy said;  &#xD;<pb n="364-365 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7402-00000184"/> 364      Roy's Search. "Be sure, Jed, and come and see me soon-. grandfather wanted me to invite you. He has something first-rate to talk over with you because you was so kind to me when I was in trouble!" "That's the honestest th at ever I set me two eyes upon," shouted Pat, who had hurnied to greet Roy, arriving out of breath in time to see the slei  bear him away, "good luck, an' the blssings of all the saints attind him!"
