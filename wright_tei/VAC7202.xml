She was a phantom of delight When first sho gleamned upon my sight; A lovely apparition, sent To be a moment's ornament. I saw her, upon nearer view, A spirit yet a woman too! A creature, not too bright or good For hunian nature's daily food; For transient sorrows, simple wiles, Praise, larne, love, kisses, tears, and smiles," WORDSWORTH. PHLADELPHA  J. B. LIPPINCOTT &amp; CO. 18m1.  &#xD;<pb n="0-3" xml:id="VAC7202-00000002"/> Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1871, by J. B. LIPPINCOTT    &amp; CO., In the Office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington.   SAINT CECILIA. CHAPTER     I. INTRODUCTORY.  Ah, happy hills! ah, pleasing shade! Ah, fields beloved in vain I Where once my careless childhood stray'd A stranger yet to pain! I feel the gales that from you blow A momentary bliss bestow, As waving fresh their gladsome wing My weary soul they seem to soothe, And, redolent of joy and youth, To breathe'a second spring.'-GRAY.  No schoolboy hails the holidays with more delight than I did the closing of the courts of law at the end of Trinity Term in 1869. Arduous and unceasing labor had utterly broken me down, and I felt that I was no longer young. It was Lord Stowell, I believe, who, when consulted by a gentleman as to a profession for his son, told him that the two requisites most essential to success at the bar were that the aspirant should have no inheritance in hand or in hope, and that he should possess the constitution of a horse. I, who had only the first of these qualifications, acknowledge this to be one of the wisest dicta of that learned judge. I now experienced a symptom which-- many a man of delicate and nervous temperament will (3)  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7202-00000003"/> 4 .SAINT CECJILIA. recognize at once,-the impossibility of finding rest in or near the scene of his labors. The hours of sleep brought me no refreshment. My bedside was haunted by spectral clients, attorneys, and witnesses. Sleeping, I was oppressed with a nightmare of voluminous briefs, and heavy tomes of statutes and reports, coming down upon me like an avalanche; while my ears were dinned with the echoed wranglings of Westminster Hall. For this malady a com- plete change of scene, occupations, and associations affords the speediest cure. I am a man of quiet tastes, and, through long years passed amid the smoke, mud, and turmoil of London, have retained my early love of rural life. I now gladly accepted the well-timed and pressing invitation of an old college friend to spend some quiet weeks with him at his country-house. This was a mansion often crowded with guests during the season mdst favorable to field sports. But my friend Percival knew that I would prefer a ram- ble in the woods on a summer's day, or to shelter myself, book in hand, under one of his ancestral oaks, to beating over his covers in September, with the chance of peppering the companions of my sports. He promised me that at this season I should have quiet and solitude enough. A few days after, I was delighted to find myself at a railway station in the North, for I am myself a North of England man. While the train swept on toward the Scot- tish border, I stepped into the carriage which Percival had sent to meet me. The horses' heads were turned westward. I saw the distant hills swelling into mountains; and here in populous England, teeming with men and the work of their hands, dethroning nature to make room for art, I was driven for miles through one of the few regions where rustic life and rustic occupations still predominate in the landscape.   SAINT CECILIA.         5 We were soon among the hills, the road leading us through a valley highly cultivated but narrow, and ascend- ing rapidly, as the waters of the brook, meeting us on their downward path, told us in louder murmurs, as they glided and tumbled onward, hastening to swell the cur- rent of the Ken. I took the more interest in the landscape as it was new to me. For, intimate as I had long been with Percival, I was a stranger to his home. It was only in London that we had ever inet since we had parted at Oxford on our widely-divergent paths through life. But my childhood had been passed not only amid rural scenes, but in a hill country like this; and now, with the murmurs of the waters soothing my ears, inhaling the fresh breeze laden with the mingled odors gathered from bank and hedge, gazing on sloping fields covered with luxuriant crops, which hid the soil that nourished them, or on deep pastures occupied by the contented and ruminating herd, o on the more restless sheep scattered higher up on the hillside, the top of which was crowned with overhanging woods, I breathed more deeply, awoke to new life, and dreamed over again my childhood's buried years. The coachman roused me from my reverie to point out the hedge which marked the boundary of his master's domain; and at the hend of the gorge by which we had been ascending he again called my attention, pointing with his whip into the broad valley below us. Looking in the direction he indicated, I distinguished, beyond wide fields and meadows, two or three gables and portions of the roof of a spacious house, still more than a mile off, and em- bowered in woods, on which fell the last rays of the sun before it sank behind the mountains of Cumberland. I found my friend Percival alone, as I had been led to expect. His eldest son was in the army, his younger sons 1*  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7202-00000004"/> 6         SAINT CECILIA. at Oxford or at school ; his wife and daughters were paying a round of visits to relatives in distant parts of England. He was occupying but one wing of his house, having seized the occasion to renovate a large part of the mansion; and was surrounded by workmen and the materials of their various trades. After a late dinner and two or three hours spent chiefly in recalling the reminiscences of the years we had passed together at Christ Church College, I llea'ded fatigue alnd went to bed ; but not before Percival had planned for the morrow an excursion by which I was to begin my ae- quaintanee with the region around us. But on that morrow I found that, if I had not reckoned without my host, I had not consulted his climate. During breakfast the summer rain poure'd down in intermitting but rival torrents; and whllen we rose fromn table Percival said, "I fear we will have to rely this morning on such amusements as we can find within doors.' He now led the way into an adjoining roonm. This was an apartment of good size, lighted by a single but large bay-window. A handsome room, handsomely furnished, with some indications of woman's occhpations and tastes, it had yet about it that undefinable air which implied that it had been little used of late years. . We seated ourselves near the window, which afforded a wide but now watery and dreary prospect, and while Percival descanted on the scenes in the neighborhood, to which, but for the rain, we would have ridden this morning, I consoled myself with a narrower tour, my eyes wandering observantly around the room. It must have been an eminently cheerful and at- tractive apartment once. Nor was there any obvious reason why it should not be so now; except that every article of furniture, handsome and well preserved as it was, recalled to mind the generation which had not long passed   SAINT' CECILI.4.  away. There was indeed nothing antique about it; but forms now unfashionable and faded hues implied that all had grown old and grave together. The most conspicuous object before me was a heavy curtain, of a dark but rich stuff, hanging against the wall,- apparently covering the frame of a large picture, placed exactly where the light of the bay-windowwould fall upon it to the best advantage. Observing my abstraction, and surmising the cause, Pereival said , "This was my motler's favorite apartment; and it was thus furnished when she was brought hither a bride. Much of her time, especially in her latter 'years, was passed here. Since her death it has been little used. But it is inseparably associated in my mind with her, and I keep it as much as possible in the condition in which it was wh en'she last occupied it." Percival's remarks not demanding an answer, I continued meditatively silent, with my eyes fixed on the dark curtain before me, while I pictured in fancy the various images which might possibly be hidden behind it. "I usually keep this room shut up," he continued, " and seldom sit here, except when left alone at home, or in my more thoughtful moods. But here is the sun looking out between the showers. I wish to show you this picture. As we do not enjoy the bright skies of Italy, I must seize this fitful flood of light, that you may see it to advantage.' So saying he stepped to the curtain and drew it aside. I placed myself at a point from which I would have a good view of the picture, and Percival coming to my side, we gazed on it for some time in silence. At length he said, "What do you think of it as a work of art?" In truth, I liad forgotten art," I answered. "But the painter would forgive me, since it is liis happy combination and expression of natural beauties which led me to forget hinm. Yet the sulject is simple, almost commonplace; and  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7202-00000005"/> U         3ALLVIl' 1I J-ILIi. the uninitiated might imagine that it required only the skilful hand to picture this." "And what," asked Percival, "do you take to be the subject?" "From the extreme beauty of the young woman, the devotion and even enthusiasm expressed by her counte- nance and attitude, and from the harp by her side, I infer that this is St. Cecilia. But it differs from other repre- sentations of the saint that I have seen. I suppose that you were lucky enough to pick this up during your long sojourn in Italy, after you left Oxford." I will attempt to describe what I have no pencil to portray. The scene was the edge of a deep wood. From the left an oak, with knarled and weather-beaten trunk, spread its branches over a rocky foreground. On the right, beneath the boughs, a long stretch of rugged and desolate country was seen parching under the summer's sun. Beyond rose a range of mountains whichl the stu- dent of Italian scenery might recognize as the Southern Apennines. Under the branching oak, but with a strong light beaming down upon her, stood a woman in the bloom of youth, with her left side partially turned to the spectator, and looking up toward heaven. On the bank, beside her, lay an open psalter; a pair of sandals had been thrown off on the ground; with the back of her left hand she was discard- ingly thrusting aside the harp, too feeble an instrument to express her emotions. Her right foot rested on a low ledge of rock, and the left heel was raised as if she was taking a step upward. The right arm was upheaved in the impulse of that devout ecstasy strongly stamped on every feature of her upturned face. She was robed in white, except the blue mantle, which seemed to be falling from her shoulders, one end of it already trailing on the ground. Tall of stature, she appeared yet taller fi'om the attitude in   JS..llV . ^.1 V /lijL.     9 which she stood. The feet still lightly rested on lie earth, but the air of the whole figure was heavenward. With nostrils slightly dilated and parted lips, she seemed about to breathe out some heavenly melody. On a branch of the oak, and close beside her, sat a dove, and at her feet lay a lamb. With their watchful but confiding eyes fixed upon her, both seemed listening for the coming chant. Tile picture grew on me as I gazed on it, rd I said to Percival, "You were more judicious or more lucky than most of our connoisseurs who patronize the p'cture dealers of Italy. They often pay well for works taat are mere daubs compared with this." "Then you have no doubt of its Italian origin?" "It is only the subject and some features of the scenery," I answered, " that led me to that conclusion. This is not an old painting, but it may be a masterly copy of one. Nor is this an Italian beauty. But we krow that the painters and poets of the south often show a preference for a type of female loveliness not common on the other side of the Alps. In the fair complexion, bile eyes, and golden-tinted locks of the Teutonic beauty, wi;h her loftier stature and fuller physical development, and in her consti- tutional serenity and repose, there is somethirg peculiarly suited to the representation of angels and saints." "We at least think so," said Percival. "And some artists in the North of Europe have, like Rubens, pushed this taste to an extreme." "That predilection for the blonde, even in t ie south," I replied, "is largely owing to the historical fact that the Teutonic nations, after overrunning and conquering nearly all Europe, established their type as the standard of beauty. The fair dames of the castle naturally outshone the swarthy daughters of the subject race." "The historical fact to which you refer," said Percival,  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7202-00000006"/> 10        SAINT COCILIA. "is simply indicative of a broader truth: the natural supremacy of the fairer over the darker races. We see in- dications of it all over the world, and in all ages. Here in Europe, centuries after the great migrations from the north, the widespread and wonderful conquests of mere handfuls of Scandinavians, who made themselves princes and nobles wherever they settled, attest the same truth." During this discussion I had not ceased to gaze atten- tively on the picture before me, and now said, "Notwith- standing the beauty of her features and the symmetry of her form, there is a marked individuality about her that leads me to imagine this rather a portrait than the repre- sentation of the painter's ideal of female loveliness. If we take the best productions of Grecian art for our standard, this head cannot be called classic. The chin and lower jaw are rather too massive. The mouth is well formed but too large. The upper parts of the face arc beautiful and noble, but less Greek than Roman, and the brow more indicative of intellectuality than those of classic models. But the longer I gaze on this form the more unwilling I am to alter it by a single stroke of the pencil The entire figure is noble, and the expression not only inspired but inspiring. The artist has thrown his whole soul into the picture." "He did indeed!" exclaimed Percival. The recollec- tion of the original haunted him through life, and did not add to his happiness." "Then you know the history of this painting?" "I know it well," Percival answered. "It is the pro- duction of an English artist while yet a young man. .He afterward rose to wealth and fame, yet never, I think, equaled this earlier work; for he never again painted under equal inspiration. The subject was an English woman whose youth coincided with ours. If alive she   SAINT CECILIA.        o" would not be old, and yet, my dear fellow, we are n6o' longer young." "I feel that too sensibly," I answered. "But to return to our subject: this is so evidently a portrait that I must ask if it is not a flattering likeness?" "I never saw her," answered Percival. "But I have been told by many that it barely did her justice. So said my mother, who knew her well, and loved her dearly. Yet her intercourse with her lasted but for a year, and I at that time was rambling over the continent." Percival was silent for a moment, then added, gravely, "Perhaps it is well that I was away." I looked inquiringly at him, but he only answered my look by saying, "Although the incidents of her life never rose to the height of adventure, yet there was much in her career, and more in her character, that may well excite interest. While we are weather-bound this morning I do not know that I can entertain you better than with a sketch of her history." "Let us seat ourselves here, then, before the picture," I said. "I like illustrated stories, and whatever be the merit of yours, few have been adorned by illustrations like this." As I spoke, the sun again looked down upon this nether world, and a flood of light again brought out all the beau- ties of the picture before us. Percival's narrative was but the sketch of a life. But finding me deeply interested in it, and anxious for further details, at its close he went to a bureau in the room and took out a box or casket of rosewood inlaid with mother- of-pearl. Opening it, he said, "You will find here much that will throw further light on my story. You can ex- amine it at your leisure, while I go and look after my workmen. When you let the mason, the carpenter, and  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7202-00000007"/> 12        SAINT CECILIA. the upholsterer get into your house, your state is like that of the unhappy demoniac possessed by seven devils. It is almost as difficult to exorcise them out of it."7 I found in this casket numerous letters passing between a daughter and her father and mother, and also three volumes of a diary; the first written, in the beginning, in a girlish hand, and in French, which was afterward ex- changed for German, which last made it a sealed book to me, until I could find a translator. The others were in English, and on the fly-leaf of the last the motto attracted my attention: "Tell the truth of yourself to yourself." Besides these there were many sheets, closely written, in a different hand, covered with notes and memoranda relating to the writer of the diary. I learned from Percival that these last were written by his mother. I spent the morning looking over these documents, and became so much interested in the subject as to make it the almost exclusive topic of conversation and inquiry during the evening. At length Percival exclaimed, "My dear fellow, I re- member well your promising attempts at the elegy, and more than suspect you of having begun an historical ro- mance, which you only abandoned on finding the ground preoccupied. You were born to be a man of letters, and deserted your true calling when you gave yourself to the law. Themis stole you from the Muses; but it is not too late to make a partial restitution. You have leisure here. Let me urge you to work up these materials into the form of a narrative. You will say that you came here to rest, not to work; but to an active mind there is no rest like change of occupation. That is the true meaning of di- version With these well-digested materials the labor will not be great, and I can give you some aid." The proposal suited my humor. During the weeks I   S4INT CECILIA.         13 was rusticating there I employed several hours daily in what proved a highly interesting occupation, which led me to visit, under Percival's guidance, many scenes in the neighborhood which had been favorite haunts with my heroine, or were in some way connected with her story. Before I left that part of the country4I had made so much progress that, by seizing, during some months, each in- terval of leisure from professional occupation, I am now able to lay my narrative before the reader. Indeed, the materials that fell 'into my hands were already so well digested that mine has been the labor of an editor rather than an author. But although those who fill the conspicuous places in the following story have passed away, I have been careful to change the names, and in a measure the localities, in order not to bring the private history of well-known families before the public. There are also some gaps in the story which I have been unable to fill up; but they matter little in what is but the frag- ment of a woman's life. CHAPTER II. "Far o'er the waves, as morn's soft beams returning, Slowly unveils the well-remembered shore; How swells my heart, with eager fancies burning, Dreams of past joys and hopes of priceless store!" MODERN SONG. ON a pleasant morning in the autumn of 183-, the steamer had shot out of the port of Calais with the ebb tide, yet she did not move with the speed that marks the packets of the present day. The light sea-breeze soon swept away the fog, the sun shone out brightly, and the 2  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7202-00000008"/> "        SA lNT CECIliA. passengers, gathered in groups upon the deck, having made themselves as comfortable as landsmen can be at sea, now found leisure to observe each other. Among those assembled here few merited special atten- tion. At least so thought two men who were standing amidships, facing the stern, and eying the various groups before them. A tall footman in a handsome livery was lounging near them, and seemed to be sufficiently of the party to listen to their conversation. "We have few notables for our compagnons de voyage this morning, Monsieur Carson," said one of them, an alert, athletic man vith a sunburnt face and an air of polite assurance. Neither his accent, dress, nor physi- ognomy gave any di tinct clue to his nativity. He might be French, Swiss, German, or Italian; but the experienced traveller w  recognize him at once as one of those cos- mopolites called couriers. "There is no one distingue in the crowd,' his com- panion answered. "We have seldom fallen among such a herd." It was more difficult to define the social position of the last speaker. He was about forty, of middle height, with a spare, active figure, a watchful air, and a grave but sardonic countenance. But for his fashionable dress and scrupulous neatness, he might be taken for one of those self-styled evangelicals who, sure of their own election, look out from their sanctity in scorn and indignation on a backsliding world. He was evidently one who stood upon his dignity; but he spoke to his companion with an air and tone of condescending affability. He now took a survey of the people around him in detail, muttering in an undertone a running commentary not flattering to the subjects of it. "That fellow is a French dancing-master; the man next him an Italian fiddler; he   SAINT CECILIA.         15 who is insinuating himself into conversation with them is a German Jew; mademoiselle there is a bankrupt Paris modiste; all birds of prey, who seek their pigeons, in England. That comfortable couple are a Londoner and his wife. They have made a little money by some greasy trade, and have crossed the Channel to see a little of the world. They heard that France was a cheap country, and have been seeking eighteen pence worth of pleasure for their shilling." Continuing his survey in this spirit, his eye at length rested on two female figures seated not far from him. On them alone he nmade no comment, In truth, they seemed to puzzle him, for he turned to look at them more than once with the dissatisfied air of one who was at fault in his scrutiny. Glancing his eve again over the groups before him, lhe said aloud to his companion, "I do not see a single person known to us." "Yet Sir Arthur has found acquaintances," said the courier. "See him with those ladies at'the stern of the steamer. " Carson eyed them suspiciously; then said, in a tone of indignant contempt, "A mother with her two marriageable daughters, of course!" Had Sir Arthur been some years younger, Carson might have passed for his tutor, sent abroad with him to see that he got into no matrimonial scrapes. "That pursy old chap," said the courier, " whom they are now introducing to him, is the 'papa.' And that youngster, so exquisitely gotten up, is young hopeful, the son and heir." "Heir, indeed!" said Carson, scornfully. "I recognize them now. They fell in with us, for a single hour, some month s ago at Florence. I hoped we had seen the last of them; and here they are greeting us as if their ancestors  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7202-00000009"/> 16        SAINT CECILIA. had been for ten generations next neighbors to Acton Holme. Now will Sir Arthur be bored by them until we reach Dover." If Sir Arthur was bored he stood it well, for he re- mained some time talking gayly with the family who had fastened an acquaintance upon him. The courier mean- while changed the topic of his conversation. "Travelling is my business, Monsieur Carson; but travel- ling in pleasant company is my pleasure. I have been so fortunate of late as to unite the two, for I have found yours a delightful party. I trust that when you next think of leaving home for the continent you will drop a line to me, to the care of Monsieur Raynoard, No. 93 Rue Rivoli. I will be sure to put myself at your command." "You have made yourself so useful rand agreeable," answered Carson, condescendingly, "that we would be quite lost on the continent without you. Our movements are often sudden and erratic; but I will endeavor to let you know of them betimes." "You will not now stop long in London," asked the courier, " but hasten down at once into the North?" "We shall not stop a day," answered Carson. "The sporting season is at hand.. The pheasants are fluttering with impatience, and the foxes are tired of their idle life. We make a point of being at Acton Holme in September. Our friends think us bound to keep open house for them during the season." "Then you are not yet near the end of your journey," said the courier. "I think," continued he, in an insinuat- ing tone, "that I could make myself as useful to you on an English road as elsewhere. I do not lose my service- able qualities by crossing the Channel." His grave companion indulged in his nearest approach to a laugh.   SAINTr CEC'ILIA.        17 "My friend; we know the northern road so well, and what is more impoi'tant, are so well known on it, that you could not be of the least use to us. The truth is, it is only by mistake, and through our somewhat habitual neg- lect of economy, that we brought you so far. We now must part, and I trust we part excellent friends.. You can- not complain that we have been wanting in liberality." "I would be ungrateful indeed should I say so." "Moreover," said Carson, " we will recommend you to all future travellers as the prince of couriers. At present we can do no more for youl." Sir Arthur had now gracefully extricated himself from the party which had attempted to appropriate him, and lounged toward the last speaker. At a slight motion of his hand Carson sprang forward, and betrayed the fact that he was only the gentleman's gentleman. At a word fromn his master he sent off the footman, who came back in a moment with a field-glass, with which Sir Arthur, after glancing at the shipping and numerous fishing-boats in sight, proceeded to examine the features of the French coast. While he is giving it a minute examination with the air of a young greJ!r',al planning a descent upon it, we will inspect him. He was still young, being under thirty, very tall, but well formed and round of limb. He had that. easy, graceful car- riage sometimes given by nature, oftel acquired by an addic- tion to manly sports, but best perfected by the consciousness of occupying an assured position. But something like an air of indolence hung about him. His face was handsome and intelligent, but expressed more amiability of temper than force of character. Cheerful and even lively as he liad shown himself while conversing with the party which he had just left, now that he was silent a pensive expres- sion predomlillatcd in his couJitenlacee. But it indicated 2* A  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7202-00000010"/> 18        SAINT CECILIA. sentiment, not sorrow. The world and he looked .kindly on each otheir. The current of time hadl run smoothly with him, although he was occasionally puzzled how to fill up lis hours. He was one of those few who labor under the unusual want of some solid troubles to rouse his energies, and make him a man of action and of earnest thought. As the French coast faded away in the distance, Sir Arthur closed the glass and handed it to Carson, who handed it to the footman, who returned it to its place. Then, leaning his tall person against the bulwarks, Sir Arthur began a scrutinizing survey of his fellow-pas- sengers; for, like most idlers, who have no business of their own to occupy them, he prided himself on being a keen observer of men, not forgetting women. But his scrutiny seemed to be conducted in a more kindly spirit than that of the cynical Carson. The only object that ap- peared distasteful to him was the pretentious and affected young fellow whom the courier had characterized as young hopeful. As Sir Arthur eyed him he muttered to him- self,- "I like the French very well, barring their infidelity and profligacy, and some other peccadilloes; but a Frenchified Englishman is always a failure." Continuing his inspection of the crowd of passengers, his eye at length fell upon the two female figures which had attracted the attention of his servant. They were seated somewhat apart from the crowd, and seemed to shun communication with others. Their travelling-dresses were similar in material and fa shion, and as plain as was compatible with a .genteel appearance.  It was evident that economy had been consulted, if it did not regulate their costume. One of them spoke often to the other in subdued but lively tones, but their eyes seemed   SAINT CECILIA.         19 fixed on the distant coast of Kent, and he cofld not see their faces. He now lounged across the deck to the side on which they were sitting; and, throwing himself on a vacant seat, drew a small volume from his pocket and began to read. But presently an animated expression in a sweet but foreign tone struck his ear, and he glanced at the two figures be- fore him. He could now see their faces. They were apparently a mother and daughter, a girl of fifteen, hardly older. She spoke fiequently, in a low tone but with great vivacity. Sir Arthur, catching an occasional phrase, per- ceived that'she spoke Gelrman and was answered in tile same latnguage. Being ignorant of that tongue, he did not feel himself an eavesdropper. Their air and countenances riveting his attention, he placed his left hand over his brow, as if shading his eyes, and kept his little book before hiim, while in his half-recumbent posture he gazed on themn long and earnestly. If I were a painter," he at length said to himself, ' in- stead of the indolent. and perhaps ignorant, buyer of other men's works, now would I produce an allegorical picture of life. Shakspeare has given us a poetical delineation of the seven ages of man ; but, in another point of view, life has but two phases, the past and the future; for the present perishes, before we can say 'Tis here!' This fair young girl, scarce swelling itnto womanhood, but restless with exuberant life, should personify Hope. The faded, sad- dened, but still beautiful mother, with careworn brow and sobered eye, should picture Experience. The one is the gallant bark just launched and rigged, sailing out of port with fiavoring breeze; the other, the long buffeted and shattered cruiser on a lee-sshore, vainly struIggling with the baffling winds. Is this nautical simile inspired by the  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7202-00000011"/> 20         SAINT CECILIA. brine laden zephyr? I doubt the originality of the thought. What says Shakspeare? 'How like a youngster, or a prodigal, The scarfed bark puts from her native bay Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind! How like a prodigal doth she return; With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails, Lean, rent, and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!' There is no originality since Shakspeare's day. In him can be found the epitome and quintessence of every con- ception!" Looking at the pair before him, he muttered, "-There is something in that elder face which haunts me like a dream of my childhood. I associate it, too, with this wide ex- panse and restless tossing of the sea. Yet it must be a dream, for I can give it neither date, locality, nor name!" Continuing to gaze furtively on the jtair, he puzzled him- self with these and similar miusings, coming to no conclu- sion but that the German was not only the most copious and expressive of languages, but in some mouths the most melodious of tongues. He now saw that he had attracted their attention and become an object of curiosity to them. They seemed annoyed at his eying them so steadily, and he was driven to a profounder study of his small volume, relieved occasionally by a stolen excursion of the eyes to the spot where the mother and daughter sat. The latter especially was no longer so observant of the coast of Kent. She was evidently making not only a mental but a verbal sketch of the stranger before her. Something mischievous in the tones of her voice, and an archness in the expression of her countenance, convinced him that his portrait was re- ceiving sonie touches of caricature. The mother strove to suppress her smile, and seemed to protest against the like- ness but the young girl, with planfiul vivacity, persisted   SAWINT CECILI.        21 in her satirical comments. She even drew out what looked to Sir Arthur very like a sketch-book, flourished her pencil mischievously, and was only restrained from using it by her mother's protest. Sir Arthur perceived that his persistent and critical ob- servation of them had given offense to the daughter at least. He was accustomed to afford amusement and to be an object of interest to the ladies; but not in the way this very young lady chose to find it. In vain he said to him- self, "She is almost a child." He could not help wishing that she would look on him with different eyes, or rather that she would turn those magnificent eyes upon him in a different spirit from that which moved her now. But he kept his ground manfully, for he was loath to quit this spot. Turning his eyes away, he began to wonder whether they spoke French, and whether, without obtrusiveness, he could open a conversation with them. There was something in the mother's face which laid a spell upon him, and made him anxious to keep her in sight, and long to discover who she was. They were now nearing Dover, when the rotund papa and husband of the friends he had nliade in one short hour in Florence bustled up to him, brimful of cordiality and politenesq. "Our short voyage is nearly over, Sir Arthur Acton. I will now bid vou adieu. Perhaps you would like to take leave of the ladies before we are involved in the confusion of debarkation?" The young girl was speaking at this moment, and did not catch the stranger's name. But the mother, on hear- ing it, turned suddenly, and gazed earnestly at him. 'Then the shadow of saddened memories passed over her face, and she turned away with a sigh, before, occupied as his attention was, he had time to observe her. Rising slowly from his seat, he cast one lingering look toward the mother  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7202-00000012"/> 22        $SAINT CECILIA. and daughter; then with an air of resignation, which bore a comic reselmblance to that of a martyr, he followed the old gentleman to the family group. Before he was allowed to conclude his leave-taking, the packet was near the pier; but from the state of the tide the passengers had to use boats in landing. Amid the crowd, now swelled by boatmen and porters, Sir Arthur looked around for the two ladies who had so long occupied his attention. He saw them near the spot where he had left them; but they were standing up, and looking eagerly, nay, anxiously, toward the quay. He now saw that although the mother was of good height, this slight girl somewhat overtopped her. Suddenly there passed over their faces a change from anxiety to delight when a gentle- man of a military air and bearing pushed through the crowd toward them. Sir Arthur was near enough to hear the exclamations "My husband '" "My father!' as they sprang forward to meet him. "They are English, after all," he muttered, " and only spoke German for privacy in talking to each other." Dis- regarding the bustle around him, and forgetting that he too was at the end of his voyage, he leaned against the bulwarks watching the family group. The husband had been handsome, and retained aI striking air; but animated and flushed as he was at this imeeting with his wife and daughter, he was thin and sallow, and, soldier as he was, and not yet fifty, he did not look as if even one campaign was left in him. "That is a man that I ought to know," muttered Sir Arthur, looking observantly at him. "And vet I have never seen him before." A porter was soon ladnl with their luggage, and they proceeded to leave the vessel. Sir Arthur now remembered that he too was a traveller, so he sauntered after them, somewhat in the manner, but not exactly with the air, of a   SAINT CECILIA.         23 detective watching a suspected party. He intended landing by the samne boat; but a family party thrust themselves before him, and filled it, so that he had to look for another. He was kept waiting in it for some tine, until its live cargo was completed, and had the mortification to see the officer and his party reach the quay while he was still far from it. When he landed, the party which had so strangely excited his curiosity, he hardly knew rwhy, had vanished. Like the detective when he suddenly loses all trace of his g Lame, Sir Arthur peered about eagerly, as he hur- ried on, and at last he espied them getting into a hackney coach. With rapid strides he lpushed through the crowd, resolved to make one more effort to find out who they were; a name on a valise, or something else, might give him a clue. The father, standing with one foot on the carriage step, was paying the porter; the daughter, on the front seat, was looking fondly out on her newly-recovered parent. At this moment Sir Arthur, forcing his way through the throng, ran over a little old woman with a basket of oranges. He stopped, picked her up like a child, and set her on her feet. At this moment he heard a, merry, girlish laugh lnear at hand ; but seeing the old. woman's basket more than half emptied, and some ragged young Ishmaelites, who beset this route of travel, gather- ing up the rich spoils of the catastrophe, he stopped com- passionately, and, thrusting his hand into his pocket, placed two sovereigns into hers. Meanwhile the officer stepped into the carriage, and it moved off at a trot; but the fair girl who had witnessed the accident, and .laughed at his perplexity, now seemed touched at his comptlnction and liberality. She looked back on him with an approving smile. He could not but smile too, in spite of his disap- pointment. Feeling that he had established a sympathy with her, he raised his hat from his head. She replied by  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7202-00000013"/> 24        4SAINT CECILIA. bowing hers, and he stood looking after her, and observed by her, until the carriage turned a corner, and he saw her no more. At this moment Carson stepped up to him and said, "Everything is ready, Sir Arthur. The luggage is on Athe carriage, and it waits only for you." There was some- thing of reproof in Carson's tone; but Sir Arthur did not heed it. Remembering at length that he himself was on a jour- ney, he turned and followed his servant, muttering to himself, "I am an inquisitive blockhead, without the wit to gratify my curiosity. But that elder face was once well known to me,-long, long ago!" CHAPTER    III. "Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man! Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless, To be seduced by thy flattery, That hast deceived so many with thy vows?" Two GENTLEMEN OF VERONA. ALTHOUGH Sir Arthur had to give up the chase, our reader must have the perseverance not only to follow this family, but to listen to their past history, in order to understand that which is to come. In the long struggle between France and Great Britain, at the end of the last century and the beginning of this, no more gallant youth had entered the English army than the Honorable Henry Guilford, the second son of the Earl of Faringdon. He was little more than a boy when he ob- tained a commission, yet took care that it should attach   SA41NT' CUE'CIL,.l       25 him to a regiment about to embark on a foreign expedi- tion. More thanl once be exchanged into other corps, in order to seize opportunities of active service. Philosophers and divines tell us that there is no such thing as luck. Yet many a man knows to his sorrow that he was born under an unlucky star. Henry Guilford's ex- perience as a soldier proved this beyond dispute. The ruling British statesmen of the period were not wanting in some of the best qualities of stateslanship ; but as a war ministry they betrayed singular incapacity. Nibbling at victory, they frittered away the resources of the country in many ill-judged, narrow, yet divergent enterprises, by which they hoped to counterbalance the concentrated energy and success of the French; and whenever they got up any expedition singularly ill conceived and con- ducted, our young soldier was sure to have a part in it. In his zealous study of the art of war, his practical lessons were limlited to the observation of blunders, and to trac- ing the causes and consequences of disaster. This would seem to be a bad sclool. Yet some who have studied in it know how much can be learned by painfully eliminating from the causes of failure the means of success. Young Guilford saw niuch service, gained experience, and a good report; and still hoped for better fortune under more skilful leaders at a future day. His regiment, having been much reduced in strength by more than one disastrous expedition, was ordered home to recruit. Being quartered in one of the eastern counties, Captain Guilford, still quite young, enjoyed himself greatly, was well received everywhere, and lived a gay life. He might have become a man of pleasure. But happening to penetrate into a quiet deanery, he there met with a singu- larly attractive young lady. He at once devoted himself 3  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7202-00000014"/> SAINT CECILI A. to her, and it was not very long before he established him- self in ler favor. Miss Warren was a scion of a family long of note, but now fallen ilto decay. She was an orphan, without for- tune, and lived with her uncle, the Dean of N--.  He was a bachelor, a student, and an invalid. Being much at- tached to his niece, he did not like the thought of giving her up. Without her light step, her sweet voice, and her joyous laugh, the deanerv would be dull indeed. But Captain Guilford had much to recommend him, and had the art to recommend himself. The dean gave a frank consent to his niece's engagement, but wished to postpone her nar- riage on thle plea of her youth. In this he found a potent ally in Lord Faringdon. This nobleman had married late in life, had been a spendthrift in youth, and his large property was still somewhat encumbered. The eller son, Lord Lowestoff, inherited his father's extravagant habits, and kept the family exchequer at a low ebb. When the younger son made known his wish to marry an almost penniless girl, the intelligence was not pleasant to the father's ear. He did not flatly object to the alliance, but to the youth of the parties. His son was barely of age, Miss Warren some years younger; they knew little of each other, and he himself was unable at present to provide his son with tlhe means of maintaining a fLamily in the style that his social position required. He wrote to the dean to this effect, and there was something in the tone of his letter not agreeable to the latter. Although lie was a Christian and a clergyman, the dean had not conquered hlis faimily pride; and the Warrens had borne themselves proudly in the midst of theirC crumbling fortunes. He in- duced his niece to refuse to listen to her lover's solicitations for their union until he had obtained the full consent of his family. The son now pleaded earnestly with his father;   SAINT CECILIA.                 2 but the old lord was stubborn; and Captain Guilford's regiment being suddenly ordered abroad, he had to tear himself away from his betrothed, who endeavored to con- sole him by promises of unchangeable fidelity, which she uttered with nlany tears. Lady Faringdon was an invalid. She was much younger and morew tender hearted than her lord. As soon as her younger son left England, she wrote to Miss Warren, re- gretting that her own health forbade her coming to see her, and inviting the young lady to spend some time at Felthorpe Park. Miss Warren went thither, nothing loath, and it did not take long to prove that Captain Guilford was not the only member of the family over whom she could extend her fascination. Lady Faringdon had no daughter, and was willing to receive one-through the choice of her son. The old lord was at first cpldly polite, but gradually softened toward her, and becgn to feel a decided interest in her. Frances Warren wXas not artful, and was at first much chilled by his manner; but she lost no fair opportunity to ingratiate herself with him. The heirs of great houses are seldom very domestic in their habits; but the eldest son, Lord Lowestoff, chanced to be at home on her arrival; and, although often a truant from the paternal mansion, le remained there during the whole of her visit, and was assidtlous in his attention and kind- ness to her. Time passed on. The vicissitudes of war made new demands for service and self-sacrifice, and more than two years elapsed without affording Captain Guilford an oppor- tunity of seeing his destined bride. Meanwhile, urged by Lady Faringdon, who was nmore than ever an invalid, Frances Warren paid her frequent and long visits, both in town and country. Lord Lowestoff, as he grew some- what older, became less extravagant in his tastes, and  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7202-00000015"/> 28        SA INT CAECIA. more domestic in his habits. Frances now seldom missed him from home. And he endeavored to make that home as agreeable to her as possible,-at least, such had been the case hitherto. But on the last visit she paid to Felthorpe Park, a change had come over her future brother. He was restless and moody. Sometimes he would rouse him- self and become lively, attentive, and entertaining. Then sinking into gloom and abstraction, lie avoided all society, especially hers. At times he would suddenly absent him- self for days together; at others, after accepting an invita- tion to pay a week's visit to a friend,; he would unex- pectedly return in a day or two. Neither his father nor mother seemed struck by the return of his erratic habits; but the change did not escape Miss Warren., She had kept up an unflagging correspondence with her lover; but, from the remoteness of the scenes to which the calls of military duty carried him, long intervals at times elapsed without hearing from him. These were always periods of anxiety and unhappiness to her. It was at such a time, when she had one day sought a secluded seat in the shrubbery, that she suddenly found Lord Lowestoff standing by her. lie remained silent for some moments, plucking the blossoms from the jasmine which hung over her head, smelling them for a moment, then throwing them on the ground. Suddenly he asked, "Have vou heard from Harry lately?" "No," she answered, sadly. Then eagerly inquired, "Have you?" "No, indeed,-he has seldom  honored me with an epistle." He said this with some bitterness of tone. "He is far away," she said with a sigh. "And the mails by sea are so uncertain. They depend upon many contingencies. I am told that even the government gets its dispatches very irregularly, and often at long intervals.   SA INT CEOILIA.        29 Perhap:;,-but it is useless to speculate on causes that may delay his letters." And she sighed deeply. Lord Lowestoff plucked afresh blossom from the jas- mine, but threw it on the ground and stamped upon it. He was strangely agitated, but made an effort to calm himself, and presently said, "How long had you known Harry when he went abroad?" She thought for a nmoment. "Four months,-only four months. I am ashamed to think," she added, blushing, Low short a time we had known each other when But so much seemed to happen in that little time." Lord Lowestoff attempted to smile, but it degenerated into a sneer. "Oh, four months is a very long time with Harry. he was always hasty, and the man is like the boy  No one has warmer or more sudden impulses, nor can form attachments more quickly. No one is, more prompt in decision and action. But I never knew him persistent in his object. I am afraid it is not easy for him now, after two years of absence, to keep up the fervor of his correspondence. He must have seen many pretty faces since he left Englanlld." "Do you doubt the continuance of his attachment to me.?" exclaimed Frances. Each letter assures me, by its whole tone, that it is unabated!" "Unabated!" said Lowestoff,.in an incredulous tone. "It was a hasty attachment, and such are often evanescent. he had not time to know you well." "Not know me well!" sle said. "lt An you doubt his loving me well?" "I do!" he exclaimed, now that I know what it; is to love. 'What is his love to mine, which has grown for years, overcoming every obstacle, until it compels mle to confess it or go mad!" Sh1 sat staring at him, dunil with astonislment, while C       *  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7202-00000016"/> 30        SAINT CECILIA.     ; Lowestoff followed up this confession with an ardent, inco- herent declaration of the growth of his passion, and hid long struggles against it; acknowledging that he now sur- rendered himself to it, and that to supplant his brother was his dearest object in life. She seemed unable to move. But when he attempted to take her hand, she sprang up and thrust himn off violently, exclaiming, "Coward! your brother is abroad facing untold dangers in his country's service, defending you and me I You stay at home to be- tray him, to dishonor yourself, and insult me!" He stood abashed and in despair, while she turned abruptly away, and walked proudly but swifty toward the house. Hastening to her chamber, she locked the door, threw herself on the bed, and burst into tears. She was utterly unprepared for such a catastrophe. She had become perfectly at home at Felthorpe Park, and had learned to love Lowestoff as a brother; but now she must learn to despise and hate him, and avoid the place where she might meet him. She was so much grieved and shocked that it was impossible for her to assume anything like composure. The dinner hour was at hand, but she did not choose to expose herself to observation. Closing the window-curtains, she undressed herself, and, ringing for her maid, sent word to Lady Faringdon that she was unwell, which was no falsehood, and had gone to bed This brought Lady Faringdon to her chamber, full of anxious inquiries; but on being assured that it was only a headache, for which fasting, quiet, and darkness were the best remedies, the old lady was at length persuaded to leave her alone. We need not depict her thoughts and feelings during some hours of solitude. Not only her head but her heart ached. At night she had to prepare herself for another visit fromn Lady Faringdon, who bad not long left her when the maid brought her a note.   SAINT CECTLIA.         3.1 She told the girl to get her a light, and then sent her awny. Opening the note, she found few words and no name signed to them. "i[ set out for Scotland in the morning. Do not shorten your visit here. For their sakes, do not let my father and mother suspect what has occurred." She burned the note at once, blew out the candle, and went to bed, but notto sleep. In the morning, when she left her chamber, Lord Lowe- stoff was gone, leaving both mother and father full of re- grets at his sudden departure, and now quite alive to the restlessness he had lately shown. They did not fail to observe Frances's pale cheeks; but, greatly to her relief traced no connection between her indisposition and their son's sudden movements. She was much at a loss what to do; but at length resolved to keep Lord Lowestoff's conduct secret even frolm his brother and her uncle, and to find some excuse for not again visiting Felthorpe Park.  Pleading indisposition, which her looks confirmed, she re- turned to the deanery the next day, in spite of the pro- tests against her making the journey while so unwell. Lady Faringdon parted with her very reluctantly. She had learned to look upon and love her as her own daughter,. and in her failing health was daily becoming more depend- ent on her society. Frances had not been many weeks at the deanery when she received a letter from Lord Faringdon, announcing that Lady Faringdon was confined to her chamber, that he had summoned home Lord Lowestoff, who was still absent, and urging Frances to come to them at once. Under these circumstances she would have waived all scruples; but while she hesitated, her uncle became much indispoosed, which gave her an excuse for delaying her journey, and before he had recovered, Lady Faringdon  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7202-00000017"/> 32        SAINT CA CILIA. died. Frances had written to Lord Faringdon to excuse her not comiing, and as soon as she could compose herself wrote to condole with him on his loss. But meanwhile his lordslip learned from some source that the dean had never been alarmingly ill. The old lord was always of a hasty temper, and iow took violent offense at her seem- ing neglect of one who had treated her as a daughte'. i-e not only expressed his feelings very bluntly in reply to her letter of condolence, but in writing to his absent son did not nicely weigh his terms in speaking of the con- duct of that son's betrothed. Captain Guilford's regrets at his long absence from Frances had been much softened by the affectionate foot- ing on which she had been received by his family. He was deeply grieved at his mother's death, much troubled at the language of his father's letter, 'and now wrote to -rances urgently asking an explanation of conduct so unnatural in her, and so inexplicable to him. She labored to remove these painful impressions from his mind without betraying the secret; but her answer proved utterly unsatisfactory. It was with many tears that she read his reply, which re- minded her that she, had been received by his mother as if she had been her own child, and charged her with a want of feeling, which made hii fear that she had under- gone a total change of character during his long absence. lIe could not recognize in the person whose conduct was described by his father the Fanny Warren whose heart he had believed was his when he left England. She wet this letter with many tears before she con- cluded, after much hesitation, that it would be difficult always to conceal from him the cause of her conduct, and that it would be safer to let hiln know it now, while his absence from England prevented his meeting with his brother, and allowed time for his anger to cool. So she   SAINT C1E'CILIA.       33 wrote to him an exact account of what had occurred, en- treating, at the same time, that it might forever remain a secret between them. But Captain Guilford was too deeply moved to comply literally with her request. Deli- cacy, and his anxiety not to harass his father in his old age, kept him silent to all but one person. To his brother he wrote a few bitter words. While forbidding all reply, he denounced his conduct and renounced him forever. His anxiety to return home was now aggravated by Miss Warren's painful position; but imperious duty called him elsewhere. Nearly two years more had passed, and his father was dead, when he again landed in England. His brother, wishing perhaps to avoid meeting him, had gone on a tour through such parts of the north of Europe as Na- poleon's successes and policy had not yet closed to Eng- lish men. The lovers were soon united. They were both still young, eminently capable of making themselves agreeable, and, being connected with many families of rank, were much in society. The tenor of their life now afforded a strong contrast to the anxious years of their betrothment and painful separation. Captain 'Guilford had been brought up in a house of lavish expenditure. Frances had little experience of the value of money. He had inherited but a small fortune for even a younger brother of his rank. Her uncle, tie dean, by his example had taught her charity, but not economy;, and on his death, soon after her marriage, had bequeathed her but a small portion. They moved among people of wealth as well as rank, and were led into a' style of living ill suited to their means. It was a primary olbject with him to cultivate the friendship and keep himself in the eves of those who could aid his professional ambition. He  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7202-00000018"/> 34        SAINAT GECILIA. thought the less of the inroads he was making in his small patrimony, as a bachelor uncle had promised to make him his heir. Some years glided on. A son was born to them, and if it was not a provident it was a happy household. The only interruption to her happiness, after the death of her uncle, arose from her husband going abroad several times on foreign service. Here his usual ill luck attended him. He had a part in the ill-judged and disastrous expeditions to Buenos Ayres and Walcheren; and when he at length obtained employment in Spain, he was sent to share not the triumphs of a Wellesley, but the f:ilures of a Bentinct. None but the soldier who has given head and heart to his profession can appreciate the disap- pointment and mortification of finding his own good ser- vices thrown away or perverted into disaster by incompe- tent leaders. Meanwhile the elder brother, now Lord Faringdon, had at length married. His wife was a woman of rank and fortune, and the union was supposed to have originated more in policy than love. ie, however, had outlived the restlessness of youth and idleness, and now lived a staid life, conspicuous in society and taking a respectable part in public affairs. The alienation of the brothers could no longer escape observation. The grave face and compressed lips of the. younger, whenever Lord Faringdon was mentioned to him, deterred inquiries even from intimate friends. To the vey few who alluded to the subject in conversation with the elder brother, he frankly but curtly avowed the fault to be his own, but said that it was now too late to remedy it. He cut short all comment on what was evidently, to him, a painful topic. Who can tell what may follow the revealing of a secret? Who can foresee the results of keeping a secret too well?    SAINT CE CILIA.        35 Delicacy, and the wish not to injure her husband's brother, had Induced Frances to exact a. promise from her husband that the secret should die with them. Similar motives had influenced him. But this silence deprived them of the power of justifying their estrangement from his nearest kinsman, in whom he naturally might have expected to find his most zealous and powerful friend. The brothers and their families holding no intercourse with each other, it was natural that they should avoid meeting. and fall into somewhat different social circles. The great families connected with the Guilfords, keeping up their intercourse with Lord Faringdon, became gradually estranged from the younger brother, who was often on service abroad. Being out of sight, he grew out of mind with those who could best befriend him. Henry Guilford had not risen in his profession as fast as he had hoped and deserved. Whatever zeal and ability a subordinate may display in an unsuccessful (nterprise, he comes in for his share of the discredit of failure. By the time he had fought his way to a majority he found that he had little left besides his ptl,--was compelled to reduce his style of living, and was no longer seen in fashionable circles. Being ordered abroad to a tropical colony, he took his family to a military post, and Mrs. Guilford now made her first acquaintance witD exclusively military cir- cles, and a life in quarters. With all her desire to be satis- fied with her condition, she could not but feel that she had made a change for the worse. Pecuniary troubles were followed by heavier griefs. At an unhealthy military station they lost their son, and only an infant girl was left them,. as much an object of anxiety as love. Major Guilford had still expectations from the uncle who had promised to make him his heir. But at the end of the war, which closed to him the field in which he had  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7202-00000019"/> hoped to Ilake his way to distinction, there followed finan- cial troubles which oppressed all classes. In the midst of them died this uncle, who, being a man of luxurious habits and somewhat given to the turf, left scarcely enough to bury him. Maijor Guilford, who had begun life with bright pros- pects and high aspirations, found himself without any fortune but his commission, and no home but the regi- mental quarters in a garrison town. The wife bore these reverses well. Grief for the loss of her son and affection for the daughter who had comne to fill his vacant place, made her content with obscurity. But the husband bitterly reproached himself for his improvidence. He was still ambitious of professional distinction, still hopeful of making *   provision for wife and daughter, and of restoring, to that daughter especially, the advantages he had lost. In youth we are ambitious for ourselves; disappointed in our hopes, we are not cured, but become ambitious for our offspring. This daughter, now in her twelfth year, already showed great intelligence, and gave promise of rare beauty. Her mother was reluctant to bring her up in the narrow and objectionable society of the regimental circle. Long and earnest were the consultations of the couple as to what should be done in the fallen condition of their fortunes. Life, to the conscientious, is made up of sacrifices, and a sacrifice mlust be imade for their daughter's sake. This in- duced Mrs. Guilford to consent, with nany tears and mis- givings, that her husband should exchange into a regiment already in India, and there strive to retrieve his ill suc- cess, while she should seek some cheap residence on the continent, where she might afford their daughter those advantages in education which, in England, were beyond their mean.. Acting on this resolution, they tore them- selves apart. Major Guilford sailed for India, and she hastened, with her daughter, to Dijon, in France.   CHAPTER IV "That living flower uprose beneath her eye, Dear as she was from cherub infancy, From hours when she would round her garden play, To time when, as the ripening years went by, Ier lovely mind could culture well repay, And more engaging grew, more pleasing day by day." CAMPBELL. ON settling herself at Dijon,' Mrs. Guilford strove to mIitigate her grief at this separation from her husband by devoting herself to the education of her daughter, directing her studies, and calling in the ablest assistance she could obtain. It was her intention to remain there during the long years of her husband's Labsence. But she gradually became sensible of two fatal objections to ,a long residence in France. Retired as her life was, she saw enough .of society to disgust her with the flippant, irreverel'nt, and infidel tone which prevailed when points of Christian faith, or even Christian morals, were the topics of conversation. On the other hand, she learned to dread almost equally the insinuating address and insidious arts by which the iagents of the Church of Rome sought to recommend, espe- cially to the young, its gorgeous and sensuous worship, and its adulterated but seductive faith. She found both these classes represented among the teachers she had en- gaged for her daughter, who already showed great, sensi- bility and enthusiasm. Of these her devotional impulses largely partook, and needed to be guided and guarded with care. After staving less than two years in Dijon, Mrs. Guil- 4  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7202-00000020"/> 38        SA1NT CECILIA. ford removed to Dresden, selecting it as at once an emi- nently Protestant city and the Florence of Germany, affording every facility for education, especially in the two arts of music and painting, for which Constance, now in her fourtcenth year, already showed great aptitude. Mrs. Guilford herself had been well educated, and had derived great benefit from being for years the constant companion of her uncle, a man of scholar-like habits. She now be- came deeply interested in the new fields of thought which the searching German mind laid open to her view; and the daughter was aided by the mother's progress and stimu- lated by her example, to fulfill the objects of their exile from home. Her zeal to perfect her daughter's education was spurred on by a motive which Mrs. Guilford avowed only to herself. A series of ill success and misfortunes had made her despondent, and she could not help dreading that the day might come when Constance would be thrown upon her own resources for support. Remembering a wise Frenchman's maxim, "W hatever be your rank or wealth, teach your son a bread-winning art," she thought the ad- vice equally applicable to the case of a daughter. But she breathed no hint of this fear to her. "I will not cloud that fair young brow with anxiety for evils which may never come." On becoming better acquainted with the language and the people, Mrs. Guilford found objections to a residence in Germany similar, but not identical, with those which had driven her out of France. The scoffing infidelity com- mon in France was indeed rare. The German mind is earnest; devout individuals were not seldomh met with, but nowhere a living church The theology of Luther was a dead faith, and the realities of sacred history and of a Christian's creed were explained away by a speculative and unsatisfying philosophy, daily branching out into new   SAINT CECILIA. i        39 schools. The mystical and dreamy German mind was forever seekiIng a religious creed and never finding one. German theology was frittering away all definite belief, until some of the most devout German intellects would not commit themselves to the formula that "God is a being." Miss Guilford dreaded the influence of this speculative spirit, whose industrious culture produced doubts for its only fruit, on her daughter's inquiring mind. She en- deavored to keep up her habitual interest and reverence for the rites of their own national church by frequenting the chapel of the English embassy whenever it was ac- cessible, and by leading her to the study of the works of some of the ablest chamlpions of Anglican orthodoxy, as the best safeguard against the perverted Christianity of Hlonme, and the yet more dangerous infidelity which would sap the foundations of Christian belief. The great collections of rare works of art in Dresden delighted Constance and stimulated her ambition, for she had already shown no little industry and skill in the u e of the crayon and the brush. Accident now furaished her with a master singularly capable of aiding her il her artistic studies. The mother anud daughter often visited the gallery of paintings adjacent to the royal palace, selecting the hours when it was least frequented. One day, while they were looking with great interest at the Madonna di San Sisto of Raphael, a person stopped near them. While the young girl, glowing with the enthusiasnl of budding genius, stood with her eyes fixed on this work of a great lmaster, Mrs. Guilford observed that the stranger watched her daulghter with great interest. lIe had found his picture in her. Mrs. Guilford watched him in turn. He was an old man, verging on seventy, tall irld bulky in person; but with an animated and benevolent countenance. Constance, now  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7202-00000021"/> 40        SAINT CECI IA4. taking a seat, opened her sketch-book, and began to trace an outline of the Madonna. The old man smiled, but checked himself at once, and, turning to Mrs. Guilford, asked, "Do you speak German, madame?" "Imperfectly," she answered. "But I can converse in it." "I see that your daughter is a young artist, a very young artist. I am an old artist, a very old one," he said, with a smile, which had something of melancholy in it. "There is a link of sympathy between us, which em- boldens me to make a request of her through you. But I should first tell you my name. I am Herr Rhodoman, and a painter." "I have often heard of you," said Mrs. Guilford. "In order to live by my art," said Herr Rhodoman, "I am often driven to portrait painting. But inspiring sub- jects are rare in this line of art." He said this with a little sneer. "Portraits are but petty productions. But I have been long preparing for a work which in one sense may be called great; for," he added, with a laugh, "it is to contain forty life-size figures. With all my contempt for portrait painting, I do not belong to the ideal school, but prefer to obtain my heads and figures by a judicious selection from real life. But I have long looked in vain for the type of one character to whom I would give a promi- nent place in my picture. I now find it in perfection here." And he pointed to Constance, who was still absorbed in her work. "What do you wish us to do?"Mrs. Guilford asked. "Give me an opportunity of taking her portrait," said Herr lhodoman. Mrs. Guilford thought for a moment. Herr Rhodoman was well known to her by reputation, and she was flattered   SAINT CECILIA.         41 at his proposal. "I see no objection to it," she said. "And Constance would be delighted to watch an artist like yourself engaged in his art." She continued conversing with him until Constance closed her sketch-book. Then calling her to them, she said, "Constance, this is Hertr Rhodoman, of whom you have, often heard." Constance made a profound courtesy, then stared at hinl with great interest. She was just now a worshiper of art, and this was the greatest artist she had yet seen. "Allow me," said he, with a kindly and paternal air, "to look at your sketch-book." Constance blushed and hesitated, but at length yielded it to him. "I am a talkative old man, my dear," said the painter, and am about to propose that we should walk through the gallery, while I give you a,garrulous discourse on art. But how shall I know to what to call your attention until I first see what progress you have made?" He turned over the leaves of the sketch book, dwelling on some of them with interest. Her proficiency surprised him. "You have good taste, and certainly no little ambition in the choice of your subjects. You handle your crayon with skill. Who is your teacher?" She named her drawing-mlaster. "A skilful copyist;" said Herr Rhodoman. "But you will get beyond him in time. Now let us proceed on our tour through this realm of art." Under his guidance Constance and her mother found a walk through the gallery far more interesting and iinstruc- tive than it had ever before been. Much, indeed, was passed over without notice. Many pictures called forth but a passing comment. But on others he dwelt for some 4*  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7202-00000022"/> 42        SAINT CECILIA. time, and taught them to see much both of merit and de.  feet that would have escaped a less practised eye. Herr Rllodoman was an enthusiast, and spoke well from a warni heart and full head, stored with the history and principles of art. Constance listened as to an oracle. She was at once all eye and all ear. And, strange to say, he was more flattered at her attention than he would have been by that of older amateurs of higher rank. The enthusiasm of the. old man and the young girl had put their hearts in unison. Constance held a catalogue in her hand, and discovering there several paintings of Herr Rhodoman's, insisted on having them pointed out. But he waved his hand de- preciatingly. "Excepting one, they are portraits, mere portraits. The most that can be said for them is that they are like the originals. But they were not good subjects for the ex- ercise of art." "But what of the one which is not a portrait?"Con- stance asked. "I once thought highly of it, but have since fallen out with it," he said. "It is faulty in conception, and there- fore cannot be good. But if God spares my life a year or two longer, I, will show you a picture, happy in concep- tion, true to nature, and illustrating an event in history that is truly great,-Saxon nature and Saxon history, and doing no discredit to art." lIe evidently contenmned what he had yet done when compared with what he was yet to do. The next day Herr Rhodoman called at Mrs. Guilford's lodgings, and induced her to visit his studio. Here Con- stance found many things besides his own works to in- terest her. For when he received payment for any of his productions he usually laid out most of his money in some   rJa ,11 r 1 C/ IX bt Irl I .43 object of virtu. He thus kept himself poor in the midst of his treasures of art. He now hastened to secure a likeness of Constance for insertion in his great picture. He placed her kneeling on the ground, with her arm resting on a basket of fruit which she had just put down. 1ier hands were clasped together, and she was looking up at her mother, who was seated above her. Herr Rhodoman, after arranging the light to suit him, went to his easel and began the sketch. But he was not satisfied. The expression of her face did not please him. There was something formal in it, and he fidgeted over his work. He left his easel and whispered to Mrs Guilford, "Talk to her of some one or something she feels a deep interest in, exciting both reverence and love. " Mrs. Guilford paused for a moment, then said, "Con- stance, how delighted your father would be to see us at this moment engaged as we are." Constance's face brightened at the thought. "But he is far, far away from us," continued Mrs. Guil- ford, hero eyes filling with tears, "and we can only think of each other withbut the hope of meeting for years. If God spares our lives, so that we meet again, you must show him that your time has not been thrown away. You owe him much for the sacrifices he is now making for you." "That is it," muttered the old painter, as he caught the expression of love, reverence, and unshaken faith stamped upon the young girl's face. While the mother continued talking in this strain, he worked away with the rapidity of enthusiasm. He had made good progress when his servant entered and said, "Count Ton Stollenburg wishes to speak to you about the family picture you promised to paint."  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7202-00000023"/> "       SA INT CECILIA. "Tell him I am too busy to see him now," Herr Rhodo- man answered, without pausing for one moment in his work. Luckily the man had more tact than his master; and before he carried back this answer he clothed it in a more courtly garb. The first sitting was soon over, and Herr Rhodoman was delighted with the result. He had secured what he had long sought, and a little time and labor would give completeness to the design. He now declared himself ready to begin the great picture, for which he had been preparing for years. The necessity of painting portraits, to which his improvidence often reduced him, had delayed it too long. Yet even now he would not tell any one what was the subject of this great work.   l Prom this time Herr Rhodolman became the most inti- mate friend Mrs. Guilford and Constance had in Dresden. lIe had no family, visited them often, and induced them to come frequently to his studio. Adopting Constance as a pupil, he directed her efforts in art, and intrusted her not only with some smaller though choice productions of his own, but with several rare paintings, the purchase of which had kept him poor. These she could thus copy at her leisure at home. But he was always urging her to draw from nature. "Mete copying can never make you an artist. -You must study nature for yourself. Shut up here in town, you have not the best field for observation, except of the human faice and form. Take a likeness of your mother, my girl And here is a weather-beaten old face and grizzled head at your service. You had better take that first, for, with its rough and strongly-marked lines, you will find it the easier to take of the two." Constance acted on this advice, and in these and other efforts at portraiture drew from him praises that delighted   SAJ INT CE CIL A1.       45 her ear. Herr Rhodoman's influence gave an undue pre- ponderance to art in Constance's education at this time But he was a man from whom much could be learned out- side of his professional pursuits, and he put his many valu- -able books at Mrs. Guilford's service. He seemed disposed to charge himself with the direction of Constance's educa- tion in letters as in art; and, being fond of music, encour- aged her to practice, and on his frequent visits of an evening usually got lher to play for him. Her voice promised well; but Mrs. Guilford did not think it prudent to put that deli- cate organ into training at so early an age. Thus Con- stance's education was not neglected. Between Herr Rhodoman, her, mother, and her own zealous spirit, she was kept so busy that before she reached fifteen continued mental excitenment began to tell on her health. A mother's eye soon observed this, and calling Herr Rhodonian's- attention to it, she asked his advice. As an artist he had been a close observer of the human form ; and in the 'tall and lathy girl who had suddenly shot up before him, he saw one who had simply outgrown her strength. He was a strenuous advocate of all those exercises which pronmote physical development. He at once prescribed the study of nature, while roaming over the heights and valleys of the Ertz-gebirg, and lof the country between Dresden and Bohemia, breathing the mountain air of this region, which ihas been miscalled the Switzerland of Saxony. "Throw books to the dogs for the piesent, and in this pleasant spring-time be as much, out of doors a's you caln. " I Mrs. Guilford resolved to proceed to the Ertz-gebirg at once, and Herr Rhodomatn bade Constance leave every book behind, Iut carry the implemenits of the artist with her. "You must bring me back more than one landscape, and a little crowd of likenesses of individual cows, sheep, and  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7202-00000024"/> "       SAINT CEC'IIA. goats, whose acquaintance you have made, not omitting the herdsman and the shepherdess who have charge of them." HeSr Rhodoman had now nmade a careful study of each of the forty figures which were to appear in his great work. He had stretched the canvas, covering at least twenty-four square yards. He had laid the ground and entered on the execution of the work. He visited his friends on the evening before they set out on their tour. He could not let Constance go away, even for a few weeks, without letting her know what was the subject of the picture. Until this moment he had kept the secret to himself, but now announced it to her. "-Luther Burning the Pope's Bull." She clapped her hands and exclaimed, "Iow much vou will make of this! The subject is truly,Saxon and truly great!" "If I fail," he answered, " it will not be the fault of the subject, but because, after a long life spent in the pursuit of my art, I am no painter, after all." He promised that on her return she should not only see all the studies he had prepared, but should watch the pro- gress of the work under his hands. "And now let us think of your health. I have brought you a present of small cost, but of great use." Constance had observed him, as he entered the room, put a small but heavy parcel on a chair. He now opened it and offered her a pair of dumb-bells., She stared at them, for she had never seen a pair before. "We should De careful to develop the powers of our bodies as well as of our minds," said he. "Next to the use of the oar, nothing better develops the arms and the chest; and well-developed lungs are the foundation of health and strength. You must carry them with you, and use them vigorously for some minutes, night and morning, every day."   SAINT CECILIA.         4 "But how am I to use them?"Constance asked, eying the dumb-bells with a puzzled air. "In this way." And the bulky old man proceeded to show her, by swinging his arms backward and forward, so as to open his chest, and then by boxing vigorously with them in his hands, until he was red in the face and quite out of breath. Mrs. Guilford smiled, and Constance could not help laughing. On this Herr Rhodoman said, "They are too light for me, and perhaps I am too old for them. Now try them yourself, imitating me." "I lhave heard that the use of them is beneficial to per- sons of sedentary habits," said Mrs. Guilford. "So, Con- stance, it will be well to try their effect." Constance took them and tried to use them according to precept and example, but was very awkward, and became exhausted sooner than he had been. "They are too heavy," she said, panting with the unwonted exertion. "At first they are, from want of the habit of muscular effort. You have little strength, and little use of that strength. You will gain both by using them. My prescrip- tion is that, holding up your head so as not to lose a hair's breadth of your height, you use them perseveringly, night and morning, until they grow too light for you, and then  --" "What then?" asked Constance. "Get a heavier pair," said Herr Rhodoman, with a smile, "and use them until they grow light, as these had done."      , Mrs. Guilford promised that his prescription should not be neglected,-and he rose to leave them. "You will start early in the morning, and I am keeping you up late. I shall miss you much; but I shall be work- ing very hard, Constance, and will have something to show you when vou conle back."  ^ ,,8 ^  I  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7202-00000025"/> 48        SAINT CECGLIA. CHAPTER V. "Art is long, and life is short." A CHANGE of air and scene, and a total change in her habits, had at once the best effects upon Constance. After two months spent in visiting numerous attractive points in the south and east of Saxony, Mrs. Guilford brought her daughter back to* Dresden with renewed health, eager to tell Herr Rhodoman of all she had seen, and to exhibit to him the proofs of her industry in their common art. The morning after their return they hastened round to his studio, for Constance was anxious to see what progress he had made in the great picture of which she had heard so much. Herr Rhodoman received them joyfully. He had missed their pleasant companionship; but had been working hard at his great picture. He had put off its execution too long. Hie was now so anxious to complete it that he declined all other employment in his art, to his great pecuniary loss. Even the profitable job of grouping the whole household of the Von Stollenburgs on cal- vas was declined. But the Stollenburgs would not be immortalized by any other artist, and resolved to wait their turn. Yet when Constance first saw the broad canvas which wag to exhibit "Luther Burning the Pope's Bull," the fire was not yet lighted, and the greater part of the figures were only sketched out. Mrs. Guilford and Constance now returned to the usual routine of their life in Dresden. The only relaxation Herr Rhodoman allowed himself he enjoyed in their company, visiting them of an evening, when he always required Constance to Dliy for hilm, occasionally accompanying   SAINT CECII,A.         49 them on their visits to the royal gallery, and expectint them to look into his studio daily, and see what progress he was manking in lis great work. The enthusiasm and freshness of feeling of the young girl seemed to supply to him some acuteness of perceltion, which years and hack. nleyed emotions had blunted in himself. Hie watched closely the impression made on her by each detail in the execution oif his picture, and drew her out to utter freely her opinions and feelings. Laboring as he himself was, he did not suffer her to be idle in the pursuit of art. Looking over the sketches from nature which she had brought back from the Ertz-gebirg and other picturesque regions, lie selected some of the best, and set her to work to make finished paintings from them under his instructions. Long, before this he had led her to the study of those works of Winkelmann which elucidate the principles and exhibit the true,character and connection of works of art. He loved to look back on those years of his youth which he had spent in Italy, and chiefly at home. Taking Winkelmann's volumes for his text-book, he fiequently discoursed to Constance on the subjects suggested by thelm with so much acuteness and ardor that she thought the living critic and historian of art superior to him who had passed away. This ex- cited in her an ealgcr craving to visit that rigor so favored by nature and by art. Thus pleasantly and profitably the suimmer glided on. The second year of Mrs. Guilford's residence in Dresden came to its end, and she was astonished to find how far she had become reconciled to her condition here. Deeply as she felt her separation from her husband, the devotion of her time to the cultivation of her daughter's rare and varied powers, and to her, own improvement, had a con- soling and wholesome effect upon her. Looking back upon 5  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7202-00000026"/> the sorrows of her past life, she felt that it was good for her that she had been afflicted, and that she was becoming more fitted to exercise a good influence over those she loved. Meanwhile her husband was making progress in India toward the objects which had led him thither. He had done good service, and won promotion by it. With an economy which was somewhat new to him, he was accumulating, out of a liberal stipend and no small amount of prize-money that fell to him, a provision against want. The letters between husband and wife became more cheer. ful, full of reviving hopes and interesting details as to the incidents of their-ways of life, now so strongly contrasted with each other. One day, Mrs. Guilford being detained at home, Con. stance went alone to the studio. Herr Rhodoman had been hard at work for hours, and was glad of an excuse to pause and examine what he had done. The old artist and the young girl drew back to a proper distance, and, stand- ing side by side, gazed upon the picture. It possessed a fresh and growing interest to them both. Although far from being finished, it was sufficiently advanced to permit one to judge of the merits of much of the execution, and of the whole design and composition of the piece. The scene was laid just outside of the eastern gate of Wittenberg. Part of the wall, the gate, and a street of that old town formed the background.  Nearly in the middle of the foreground a pile of fagots on a low plat- form was burning fiercely, while two young men in the garb of students of the sixteenth century, one on either side, were crouching and shrinking from the heat, but ready to cast fresh fuel on the flames, in which the rem- nant of a huge volume, the false decretals, was curling up and perishing by the fire, while other popish forgeries were at hand to share its fate.    The heat had driven back the crowd into an irregular semicircle, and all eyes were turned upon the central figure of the piece. This was Luther, standing on a little mound by the roadside, backed by a crowd of his pupils and con- verts. Mingled with the doctors and students of the uni- versity were seen the well-likown faces of Melanethon, Carlostad, Nicholas Amdorff, and others well known to fame. With the papal bull firmly grasped in his left hand, but unfolded to all eyes, Luther stood with his right arm raised aloft and his eyes cast upward, the coarse face and form of the plebeian monk ennobled and etherealized by the spirit which moved him to appeal from the falsehood and corruption of earth to the truth and purity of heaven. The crowd consisted not only of his immediate disciples. Here on this thoroughfare, at the gate of Wittenberg, many a passer-by had paused to witness the daring act of burning the Pope's bull, the decree of the self-styled universal pontiff and Christ's vicar on earth. Various and sharply defined were the traits and passions stamped upon the individuals who made up the crowd around him. Under various aspects was seen the stirring, elevating power of new and startling truth. The zealous attention and assent with which most. of them listened to his words assumed manifold forms; while doubt of the new religion, or animosity against the apostate monk, or anxiety for the result, did not want their representatives here. Thrifty, prosperous burghers comparing their opinions and giving a cautious assent; hardy artisans and sturdy peasants grave with unwonted thought; that mother hushing her  babe that she might not lose one uttered word; the soldier leaning on his sword and wondering hlow soon the war of words will be followed by the war of blows; and that low type of humanity, with narrow, receding brow, wide, pro.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7202-00000027"/> 56        SAINArT ECILIJA. truding jaws, and little, restless, twinkling eyes, wonder- ing what all this hubbub is about. Here stands a fierce and bigoted monk, with malignant eye fixed on Luther, while his hand grasps the dagger hidden in the breast of his gown, hoping to gain the crown of martyrdom by dis- patching this rebel against God, this enemy of the church and the saints; while his more cautious companion grasps his arm strongly, strivingl to restrain him by whispering a more wily and safer vengeance. But all the spectators, whether friends or enemties to this protest against the cor- ruptions of lonme, feel not the magnitude of the crisis, The intense interest exhibited by most of Luther's hearers is" relieved yet heightened by the contriast of other chlr- acters and motives betrayed here. That gayly - dressed and dissolute young man, with the flaunting courtesan hanging on his arm, is making a jest of the occasion. While that market-woman has put down her hamper and stands listening to the thrilling words of the inspired monk, that knavish boy is making stealthy inroads on her stock, and his comrade crouches behind with open bag to receive the stolen spoils. That grave, substantial burgher, absorbed in the eager search for Scripture truth and treasure in heaven, has lost sight of his worldly goods, while the adroit cutpuirse is laying open his wallet and easing him of his crowns. TWith all the variety of character and impulse brought together here, there was a rare unity and concentration of interest in the picture. We cannot specify all the details so expressive of the oc- casion and the age. But one figure must not be forgotten. Conspicuous in front of the others, on the right,-a lovely young girl, haIving placed her heavy basket of fruit on the ground, is kneeling by it, looking up into Luther's face with an expression of rare intelligence, deep reverence, and full faith.   SAINT CECILIA.         53 Strongly impressed by the effect of the whole picture, Constance was especially delighted with this image of herself. But when the old artist asked, " s it not like you, Constance?" she strove to conceal her gratified vanity, and answered, "Not now, Herr Rhodoman; I have grown much and changed much since that day." The painter resumed his brush and returned to his work, while Constance watched his skilful and speedy hand. His long study and preparation for this work had been too often interrupted, and its execution too long delayed by frequent calls upon him for minor productions in his art,- calls which his necessities had compelled him to obey. But now he had made good progress, and nothing should stop him until it was finished. "Herr Rhodonman," seid Constance, "if you work as fast as you have done since you began your picture, in two or three months you will be able to show it to the world." "To the world! Yes, to our little world of Dresden." But his heart swelled with triumph, and a flush of joyous light beamed from his eyes, as he thought how many might find a new motive for coming to Dresden in their desire to see his "Luther Burning the Pope's Bull." Tlhe hour for dinner was at hand, and not to keep her mother waiting, Constance hastened home, leaving Herr Rhodonman hard at work. lHe was now indefatigable, and, while the sun shone brightly, lost no time. lie but paused for one moment to call to Constance as she was leaving him: "Go home and practice, little girl; I have worked hard to-day, and shall expect some music to- night." Evening had long set in, and yet Herr Rhodoman did not come. After awhile Mrs. Guilford's servant-girl, whom she had sent out on an errand into the street on 5* :N  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7202-00000028"/> 54        SAINT CECILIA. which the artist lived, returned in grleat excitement. Herr Rhodoman had come home late, eaten a hearty dinner, and then fallen asleep in his easy-chair. At first he slept heavily and snored loudly; then scemed to rest quietly. When his servant came to wake himn up-he was dead! *   *   *   *   *   *   * Herr Rhodoman's death was the first great grief Con- stance had ever known, and she did not soon get over the shock. It had gradually assumed an almolst platernal re- lation to both mother and daughter, and Mrs. Guilford felt that they had both profited much by their intimacy with him. One point in his character had peculiarly engaged her confidence. Amiong the cultivated German minds with which she had come in contact, his alone, amid all its speculative tendencies, clung to a simple faith in that revelation which Luther had striven to purge of the cor- ruptions of Rome. After this sad gap made in their society, it seemed almost impossible to return to the routine of their life in Dresden. Constance especially needed change of scene and new associations. Mrs. Guilford was on the point of removing to some other place in Germany, when she received a letter from her husband announcing that the campaigns in which he had been engaged had resulted in the complete pacifi- cation of the peninsula ; his regiment, now reduced to a skeleton, had been ordered home, and his own health for. bade longer stay in the climate of India. He had not, indeed, accomplished all that he had hoped, in the re-estab- lishment of his affairs; but lie must be content with a partial success, and now named the time when his wife and daughter should meet him in England. That time was near at hand. A very few days of prepa- ration, and they were able to leave Dresden.

WE have already: witnessed the meeting of Colonel Guilford with the wife and daughter froml whom he had been separated so long. Joyful as the occasion was, it was yet mingled with pailful feelings on the part of the wife. The effects of the climate of India, of hard service, and of mlore thanll one wound, were plaimly written on his changed countenancze and enfeebled frame. But husband and daughter were happy and hopeful, and she strove to stifle every feeling but thankfulness and joy. Induced by the mildness of the climate , Colonel Guilford took a pleasant cottage on the soutlhernl coast of Devon- shire, seeking  to devote his long furlough to 'domestic happiness and the restoration of his health. Here they  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7202-00000029"/> 56        SAJNV' UCEUCLIA. passed the winter and spring, making few acquaintances, and feeling no want of society. The four years of separa- tion had been a period of great mental activity to each of this small family. The daughter's progress in character,  intellect, and attainments was a constant source of surprise  and triumph to her father, yet hardly more so than the  progress his wife had made; and he felt himself repaid for  painful years of absence and for all the hardships he had endured. Neither he nor his wife had proved too old to learn. They had gained in knowledge and powers in their very different spheres of activity and olservation. These indeed had been so different that they afforded almost inexhaustible sources of inquiry and conversation. Neither wife nor daughter grew tired of drawing from Colonel Guilford the details of his life in India; and his observing eye and inquiring mind had furnished him with ample stores to draw from. The duty of narrating the events and describing the scenes familiar to them during their residence in France and Germany was chiefly in- trusted to Constance. She had kept a diary, and she illus.. trated the text with verbal comments so copious, that there seemed to be danger that she would never come to the last page. Colonel Guilford thus became familiar with the inci- dents of their life on the continent. Above all, through her account of Herr Rhodoman, by the narrative of his doings, the repetition of his sayings, the description of his appear- ance, aided by sketches of his countenance and person, he was made to know him as well, and love him as much, as he could any one whom he had inever seen. Constance had so much to tell of their life in Saxony that it was long before she spoke particularly of their journey home. But one morning, while conversing with her parents, she suddenly asked, "Do you renlmerer, mamma, the tall, handsome gentleman on board the steamer,   U' who took a seat not far from us, and, while he pretended to be reading, watched us so long and closely?" "I remember him well," said Mrs. Guilford, with marked interest. "And I remember your depreciating remarks on him.. They seemed to me not a little unjust." "I was provoked," Consta nce answered, "that one so unmistakably a gentleman should be so perseveringly in- quisitive. Yet there was nothing intrusive in his man- ner. Indeed, he seemed feartfult of giving offense. He wore at times a puzzled look, especially when he looked at you, mamma; and his attention seemed to be attracted to vou by feelings which he could not explain to himself. I watched him closely, too. If he had not kept his hand constantly over his brow, I would have been tempted to make a sketch of him. lie would be useful in filling a plalce in a picture." "I had difficulty in preventing your making a sketch of him as it was," said her mother, smiliing. "But you would have made it a caricature. And unless you drew him while standing, you would lose half the advantages of his fine person."  "Oh, no," answered Constance. "His half-recumbent posture truly expressed his character. In spite of his air of strength and activity, lie is but a lazy Apollo, after all." "Only Apollo resting after the chase," said Mrs. Guil- ford, who seemed zealously bent on defending the stranger from all aspersions. "He never made exertion enough to fatigue even an indolent man." "You do him injustice, Constance," said her mother warmly. " le was evidently not habitually inactive, and he had a noble and benevolent expression of face, and a gentleness of manner indicative, no doubt, of his character. He looked as if doing good were natural to him."  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7202-00000030"/> Constance smiled. She was amused at her mother's  clothing with virtues one so utterly a stranger to her. She mischievously said, "I did not know, mamma, that good looks had so much influence over you. I admit that he seemed to be a good sort of man, who would not pass by an opportunity of doing good, if it lay in his way. But enterprising, energetic virtue is not his forte. He will never turn out of his path to hunt for good to be done." "Opportunities of doing good come fast enough, Con- stance, if we wohld only seize them. We have too many of those knight-errants of philanthropy, who are constantly leaving the path of their peculiar duties to undertake the cure of distant evils, and to right what are often imaginary wrongs." "There is nothing of the knight-errant about your favorite, malmma,"7 said Constance. "So you need not fear his going astray from that cause." Then she added, "But I know that he is a kind-hearted man." "How do you know that?" her mother asked, surprised at the confident tone of this assertion. Constance, in reply, told his adventure with the old orange- woman. "For some reason he was evidently anxious to find out who we were. But he lost his oppor- tunity through his eagerness to manke amends for the damage he had inadvertently done her. IIowever," added Constance, " he and I are acquaintances, should we ever meet, for I could not help letting him see that I observed and approved of his pity and liberality. So we exchanged smiles and bows as the carriage drove off." Colonel Guilford laughed and said, "Is that the way you make acquaintances in Germany? Such easy sociability will hardly do here. Your fellow-traveller seems to have been a very inquisitive fellow." "It is a singular coincidence," said Mrs. Guilford, after    a short pause, "that he should have been so inquisitive about us, and that I, on hearing his name, should recognize in him one whom I have not seen for twenty-three years." "Why, he must have been a child then " exclailied Constance. "Yes, a boy under six. You remember the fat old gentleman who came up and carried him off? I heard him address him as Sir Arthur Acton."    Ah, was it he?" said Colonel Guilford. "I havt heard you speak of your knowledge of him in his childhood. I have often heard of him in society." Then he added, with a melancholy smile, Bl ]ut he came on that stage after I left it, or rather was shoved off from it." "And how, cale you to know himl, mlamnlma, when he was a child?"Constance asked, with great interest "Not many months before our marriage," 1Mrs. Guilford said, "I went with my uncle, then in declining. health, to Weymouth; for sea-bathing had been prescribed for him. We lived in retired lodgings; but near us was a North country family, come to Weymnouth for the health of the head of it. It was a painful sight to see Sir Ralph Acton, a large, robust man, in the prime of his years, helped into his coach by two footmen when he was going to take the air or the bath. He was a man of old family and great estate, had been devoted to field sports, gay company, and what is miscalled good living. He had abused the powers given him and the bounties he enjoyed, until his excesses suddenly reduced him to this helpless condition. Lady Acton was a devoted wife, and in constant attendance on him. Their only child, a little boy, was, for the present, turned over to the servants, to be cared for and spoiled by them. "The condition of tIhe baronet excited the sympathy of my uncle, himself an invalid; and when Lady Acton, s  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7202-00000031"/> 60        SAINT CECILIA. attracted by his reputation for piety and learning, applied to him, as a clergyman, for advice and consolation, he be- came zealous in his attention to the anxious wife and declining husband, whose thoughts he strove to wean from the world, which was fast fading away before him. .Tlis led to frequent intercourse between Lady Acton and my- self. She was a sensible and estimable woman, and I found myself strongly drawn to her. Absorbed as she was in attendance on her husband, she felt and expressed the utmost regret at the necessity of leaving her only child to be petted and spoiled by servants, as a young heir would not fail to be. She dreaded the corrupting influence of flattery, and possibly, of vicious example, even on an infant mind. "Young Arthur had already made advances to me, and we were on excellent terms. As I became more intimate with Lady Acton, she betrayed so much anxiety as to her child that I offered to take charge of him duritng the hours when he could not be with her. Indeed, she could spare him but few minutes in the day. We had very few ac- quaintances there, had rather avoided making any, alnd were leading a very retired life. Some painful circum- stances," continued Mrs. Guilford, in a saddened tone, "mide this very desirable to me. A lively child was then a more agreeable companion to me thlan any older person would have been,-excepting one," she added, turning to her husband with a smile, which brou-ght back to him the bride of his youth. "Lady Acton eagerly accepted my offer. Sending at once for her son, she put him in my hands, saying, 'Arthur, while your papa is ill you can be little with me. Miss Warren has kindly offered to take charge of you.' She kissed him, and the tears in her eyes drew tears froml his; but he put his hand into mine and walked manfully away to our lodgings.   SAINT CE'CILIA.         61 "F;rom that day he was, for the next two months, my constant companion. During the day he never left us. Ile accoimpanied my uncle and myself on our drives, and me in 1my long walks on the sealshore, which had hitherto been so solitary. Many thin'gs had combined to depress my spirits; but I found tthe companionship of a s)rightly and affectionate child the best antidote against anxietyt and sad thoughts. He diverted and occupied my attention, and I caught something of his vivacity and freedom from care. In our daily walks upon the seashore, we strolled hand in hand, watching the curling breakers, and listening with a sense of pleasing melancholy to the hoarse voice of the ever-rolling surf. These walks on the beach led us to become conchologists and rival collectors; and when we spied some rare specimen on the beach, unclasping our hands, we raced to see who could first secure the prize. Our collections were not always very select, and often became so burdensome that I had to assist my young naturalist with his load." "It must haye been a great resource to you, mamma, if you were in grief," said Constance, deeply interested in the childhood of one whom she now identified with their fellow-voyager. "Yes," said Mrs. Guilford, " he made me the companion of all his sports. But life is not designed to be all play, even to a child. I made it mv business to continue his interrupted education, for he was in danger of forgetting the little had been taught. We now sat down for half an hour, twice a day, to our book. He proved an apt and willing scholar, and the interest I took in teaching him surprised me much. I had often thought that there could be no drier occupation than teaching a child to read ; but this task ceases to be irksome from the moment ive become interested in the child. This was my first lesson in teach- 6  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7202-00000032"/> ing and in the management of a little boy i' Here her  voice faltered, and her eves filled with tears, while Colonel  Guilford looked sorrowfully down and sighed. Constance had seldom heard either of her parents allude to the son they had lost. There is a talking and a silent grief. It is the last which lives rooted in the heart. She perceived that they were thinking of her brother, whom they had lost when not much older than Arthur Acton when under her mother's care. While this mother shrunk froml speaking of her own dead son, an instinctive yearning led her to dwell on kindred traits of early boyhood, dis- played and noted during her brief adoption of one who had not been thus early cut off. After a pause, Mrs. Guilford, who seemed loath to quit this topic, said,- "A more joyous and spirited, yet affectionate and man- ageable boy, I have never known. He became strongly attached to me, and I to him. how often have I longed to know whether he escaped the numberless temptations that must have beset his path,--so early left the heir of a great fortune and the representative of an ancient house I You may well suppose, Constance, that when I heard this stranger addressed as Sir Arthur Acton, I looked on him with other feelings than mere curiosity can excite." "How long did he remain with you, mamma?" asked Constance, who was not tired of the subject. "More than two months. My uncle's health had im- proved. The bathing season was passing away, but so was Sir Ralph Acton. My uncle had become much inter- ested in the mental condition of the dying man, and stayed until the closing scene. On my last interview with my little charge, they had already clad him in mourning. lie looked sadly down on his black garments with a be- wildered air. They tell me I can take no more walks with you on the seashore,-no more drives into the coun-   try, no more--' Here he burst into tears and threw him- self into my arms." She ceased speaking, for she could not trust her voice. Presently Constance asked, "And pray, mamma, did you hear nothing of them afterward?" "Some letters passed between Lady Acton and mvself; but after my marriage and my uncle's death our corre- spondence ceased. She lived a retired life in the North of England, devoting herself to the education of her son. 'I trust he has rewarded her care." This was said with a sigh, for hier Iin    t  r own boS, so early lost. Indeed, it was evident to Constance that her mother took the more interest in speaking of her little charge, aind her father in listening. to her narrative, because it recalled to them the image of one of whom it Wras painful to them to speak. Constance, the only young person in this small household, witl no brother or sister on whoml she could vent her affections, began to feel a sisterly concern in this briefly-adopted son of her mother, and strove to identify him with their stately fellow-passenger, who had shown so much interest in them. This feeling led her to return to the subject on future occasions; and she found her mother ever ready to enter fully upon it. So that no inci-  dent conntectted with young Arthlur Acton, while under her mother's care, remained unknown to Constance, whose vivid imagination, by some mysterious process, insepara- bly associated him with her own brother, who had died so young. Since his return from India, Colonel Guilford had taken no steps to renew his intercourse with any of his numerous relatives,-m ost of whom were persons of rank,-lor with any of his former associates in fashionable life. This may have sprung from feelings of proud independence, or from the conviction that it was only in retirement that he could '  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7202-00000033"/> "        SA INT CECILIA. practice that economy which was new to him, but which the future interest of his family so imperatively demanded. Neither he nor his wife recurred often in conversation to their early life or to their associates at that time. They seemed to have turned their backs on the past, and to live only in the present and future. He so seldom alluded to the history of the family from which he sprung, that it was only through the concise answers to the few direct questions Constance ventured to ask, and by examining a copy of the peerage which chance threw in her way, that she knew anythng of her genealogy on her father's side. Of one mysterious fact she was aware: there was an Earl of Faringdon, the only brother of her father. His name was often mentioned in the columns devoted to fashionable and parliamentary intelligence, yet she had never heard either of her parents allude to his existence. Of her mother's family she knew somewhat more; but their importance belonged to a past age. Misfortune and extravagance had alienated nearly the whole of a noble patrimony, transmitted from sire to sou from feudal times; and the present lineal head of the Warrens of Polworth Manor was a needy gentleman living in obscurity on a corner of the ancestral estate. One scion only of this an- cient family revelled in prosperity ; but this was a woman, and no longer bore the name of Warren. Constance, on the following occasion, learned more of her history than she had before known. One morning, while reading a London newspaper, Colonel Gdlilford exclaimed to his wife, "Here, Fanny, is something which ought to be of great interest to you." "What is it?" she asked. "Pray read it to me." He accordingly read, under the head of "The World of Fashion," a glowing account of a splendid fete given by   SAINT CECILIA.         65 the Honorable Mrs. Beresford. The magnificence of the entertainment, the numerous guests of high rank, the per- sons distinguished by personal merit, the. beauty of the ladies, the wit, grace, and' elegance of the hostess, annd the ulrivalled loveliness of her accomplished daughter, were all enlarged upon in the usual style of such announce- ments. It was evident that the Ilonorable Mrs. Beres- ford was a leader of the beau monde, and Miss Matilda Beresford the plaragon of the season. Lower down the column there was an on dit asserting that the Earl of L.  was about to lead the charming Miss M--   --B-d to the hymeneal altar. But lower down the column this on dit was contradicted by a second, which maintained that Sir A--   A--  was the happy man. But lower down still a third on dit contradicted them both, and represented both these lovers as in the depths of despair. "You see, Constance, what a magnificent cousin you have," said Colonel Guilford. "And this is the cousin,-mamma, of whom I have heard you speak?" "Yes, and she is really a very elegant woman ; I should say vtas, for I llaye not seen her for many years,-indeed, seldom since we were children together." "Tlelre is nothing more disgusting to me," said Colonel Guilford, " than these ostentatious accounts of the hospi- talities and festivities in private houses. A published account of presentations at court-of the levees at the royal drawing-room- is natural and right. r They are matters of some gecnral interest.

His ears are safe enough, " said Mrs. Guilford, smiling.  "We are too obscure to be made the subject of on dits o Constance felt a craving to know something of those with whom she was connected by the ties of blood. All inquiries as to the Guilfords seemed to be tacitly inter- dieted. But it was not so with th Warrens. She nowr said, "Mamma, I have before heard you mention your cousin, Mrs. Beresford ; pray give mee some account of her." Mrs. Guilford complied with her request. We need only state that while Frances Warren was lhe chi'ld of oneo brother, who early left her a penniless orphan, another brother had married a woman of fortune, and ran a pros- perous but brief career. He had several children, but took home his orphan niece, nearly of the same age with his daughter. They were growing up as twin sisters in the same house when, soon after they had entered their thir- teenth year, Mr. Warren was killed by a fall from his horse in hunting, and Frances Warrn was transferred to her uncle, the Dean of N  . 'Thenceforth the cousins were separated. By the death of a brother and sister Alice Warren became an heiress, as her maother had been. She had also no small advantages of person and mind, and was, for several years after she grew up, a reigning toast and belle. She had numerous suitors, and had smiles for all, but enjoyed her liberty too much to be easily caught. After some years of coquetry, by which she missed more than one good match, she surrendered herself to the younger brother of a noble house, and became the Honor- able Mrs. Beresford. Her married life had lnot been par- ticularly happy. her husband d a greatly restricted tho indulgence of her taste for society and expenditure. leI induced her trustees to vest her large fortune in an estate !   in the North of England; and she seldom made her appear- ance in Loidon during her husband's lifetime.

Mrs. Beresford had a vivid recollection of her own oay life as a belle. Shelwans still admirably calculated to shine in society-; and the days of mourning were not long over- when she reappeared among the elite of the fashionable world. Constance had many questions to ask as to this kins- woman with lwhom  her mother had lived on terms of sisterhood. Mrs. Guilforc retained a strong attachment  to her, and dwelt on the early period of life they had passed  together with pleasant regret, in slpite of the neglect she had since experienced from her. Yet she expressed not the slightest wish to meether now; and Constance gathered from the tone of the remarks made by botl of her parents, that Mrs. Beresford was a brilliint and fascinating woman, but devoted to fashion, fobnd of notoriety, and full of selfish ' and ambitious aims. They knew her now only by report,  and had no reason to believe that she remembered the ex-  istence, or had given a tliought to the companion of her childhood. Of the daughter, Miss Beresford, they could tell Constance nothing; so she supplied the place of facts by a number of inenious supDositions as to this young paragon of beauty and fashion, who was already so iin- portant as to become the subject of numerous on dits of the press. The young girl was evidently dazzled by her cousin's famille.  Meanwhile Constance's days were not passed in idleness. She was, indeed, the companion of her father in his ranm- bling explorations of the interesting neighborhood in which they had found a temporary home. But under her mother's  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7202-00000035"/> supervision she continued to build on the foundation of her education, so successfully laid during the four years spent abroad. Time glided smoothly but too swiftly on in the cottage on the Devonshire coast, for with the end of spring came the end of Colonel Guilford's furlough, and his health was so far restored that he would not seek to prolong' it. For just at this period, some political complications spring- ing up in the regions on the Mediterranean, his regiment was suddenly ordered to Malta, and the family were compelled to prepare for a change of residence without loss of time. Mrs. Guilford had resolved not to be again separated from her husband, if she could possibly help it. But she was loath to carry her daughter to Malta at this season of the year. She dreaded all southern posts ever since the death of her son. Moreover, a large force permanently occupied Yaletta; and her experience had given her an unfavorable opinion of the society which necessarily pre- dominates in a garrison-town. Its influence on a lovely, vivacious girl, just budding into womanhood, and certain to attract attention and excite admiration, could not be good. She was not blind to that longing for sympathy and love of approbation and admiration which Constance betrayed. Precocious in her powers, although in many respects still a child, she showed a strong craving for excitement and a dangerous sensibility to all pleasur- able lerceptions. 'The mother was convinced that her daughter's education llad too much tended to develop the enthusiasm and artistic propensities already strong within her. She now desired to subject her to a training of a different kind; but more especially to prolong the restraints of education until she had attained somewhat more of maturity. Colonel Guilford shared the feelings and con- victions of his wife. After anxious conference, they agreed that Constance was so young, and had been so long absent   from England, that she would gain much by spending a year or two at a good boarding-school, if one could be found. Her attainments indeed were already far beyond. those which girls usually bring away from tmhse places; yet there were branches of education to which she should devote more time than she yet had done. Both husband and wife too felt that they had, of late years, been standing aloof from society. It was important to give their daughter an opportunity of forming intimacies, perhaps friendships, with girls of her own age and social position. They took Constance into their councils. At first she was not a little shocked at their prolosal. She was reluc- tant to leave the father whom she had so lately recovered, and the 'mother, from whonm she had never been separated; an(d was fa;scinated by the untried novelty of a residence in Malta. Yet she was conscious that her long residence abroad had estranged her from the habits and opinions of her own country. She saw that for reasons which she could not understand, both her father and mother were isolated from their natural associates; and she had a natural wish for intercourse with girls of her own age and class. Moreover, she was ambitious, eager to cultivate her powers, and to test them in rivalry with others. The vision of a boarding-school of high repute, presided over by a lady somethiing like her own mother,-crowded with girls not unlike lherelf, who were instructed by teachers accomplished in each branch of education which could be useful or orna- mental to the sex, dazzled her imagination, for she was ever ready to outrun the tame realities of life. But where was tlis school to be found? There was little time for inquiry, and, among the multitude of pre- tentious seminaries, plenty of room for error in the choice. But Colonel Guilford now remembered the high character given by a brother officer of rank to the school from which  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7202-00000036"/> SAINTv2 CECILIA4. his two daughters had just returned to him. So much had been said in its favor that some part of it must be true. This school was at a considerable distance from themn, on the borders of Wales. The head of it was written to, and an answer received; and an exceedingly well-written answer it was. Although the number of pupils was limited, a vacancy had just been made by one who had been suddenly compelled to go home.  So it was resolved that Colonel Guilford should carry Constance thither without loss of time, while Mrs. Guilford broke up their household in his absence. This first parting of mother and daughter was a hard trial to both. But Mrs. Guilford was anxious to teacll Constance the necessity of learning to control her impulsive nature; and she put her own feelings under severe constraint until they had driven off, and -then set about her own task in tears. CHAPTER VII. "I would I had some girls now to bring up; O I could make a wench so virtuous She should say grace to every bit of meat, And gape no wider than a wafer's thickness; And she should make French court'sies so most low That every touch should turn her over backward." BEN JONSON. Tins was the day of fast coaching, just beginning to give place to the matchless speed of the steam-car. It was not late on the day after the travellers left the Devonshire cottage when they reached their place of destination, Latimer Lodge. The aspect of this place took Colonel Guilford by sur-   SAINT CECILIA.  prise. After passing throughl the little village of Orton they came in sight of a mansion of considerable size and pretensions. It was surrounded byl a shrubbery and gar- dens covering many acres. A clump of tall trees, forming a rookery:, stood to the east of the buildings, which were extensive, especially what appeared to be the stables; and a bowling-green and fountain were conspicuous in front of the house. Much to Colonel Guilford's surprise, the posthoy turned in here, and drove up to what seemed to be a gentleman's country-seat. A footman in a stylish livery answered the bell, and when Mrs. Latimer was asked for he ushered themn into a handsome and well- furnished drawing-room. They had little time to remark and comment on the indications of wealth and luxury, so unexpected at a boarding-school, for a young lady soon entered the apartment. She was exceedingly well dressed, quite good-looking, and easy and gracious in her manneis. Slhe appeared to be older than Constance, but much shorter and more mature in figure. Bestowing a gracious but somewhat studied courtesy on Colonel Guilford, she ad- vanced more sociably to Constance, and welcomed her to Latimer Lodge. Then remarking Constance's well-grown stature, indicating her close approach to womanhlood, she added, "I am sorry you put off coming here so long; you will not stay here long enough to make up for the time you have lost:" thus implying that for the purposes of education no other place could be a substitute for Latimer Lodge. Then turning to Colonel Guilford, she said, "Mrs. Latimer regrets that she must keep you waiting for a few minutes, as she is particularly engaged with her classes." "You are, I suppose, Mrs. Latimer's daughter?" said Colonel Guilford, in a doubting tone. "You are hardly old enough to assist her in the school." The young lady smiled somewhat disdainfully, saying,  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7202-00000037"/> I am only one of her pupils; and as I chanced to beo un. occupied, she sent me to apologize for keeping you wait- ing." ) Colonel Guilford thought this a capital opportunity to get intelligence as to this seminary, and put many adroit questions, which received answers quite as adroit, all calculated to make the most favorable impression on him. The good breeding, graceful manners, and intelligence of this little lady sustained her report, and Mrs. Latimer was soon at hand to confirm the impression. She entered, accompanied by a girl somewhat younger than the one who had first received the strangers. She was quite as well dressed,-perhaps more of a beauty,-with an equally easy and well-bred air. Mrs. Latimer was about forty; a stately lady, still retaining much of the good looks of her  youth, with a gracious manner, which implied that she unbent from her dignity in consideration of the peculiar merits of the person she was addressing; each of whom felt this in turn, and received it as a special compliment to himi or herself. She introduced her two pupils. One was the daughter of Mr. R-- M--, M P. for G--   , and the other of Sir W--   L- , of L--- Hall. It was evident that the school was patronized by the first people in this- and the adjoining counties. The young ladies drew Constance aside to a window overlooking the lawn and shrubbery, and engaged her attention, leaving Mrs. Latimer to confer at-her ease with the father of the new scholar. After a few inquiries, he made arrangements for Con- stance's reception into the school; then apologized to Mrs. Latimer for having occupied so much of her precious time. But Mrs. Latimer best knew how to employ her time. "I take care to engaoe ang able corps of assistants," she said, " and can spare the time. Already I feel an interest   in my new charge"-looking kindly round on Constance. "She at once recommends herself; and I am anxious to i know what her previous training s been, and what you particularly desire as to her studlies. For, although in the great essentials of education we )ursue a regular course, there are many points on which we consult the wishes of the parent and the peculiar capacity of the pupil. So pray instruct mIe on these points." This was enough to induce Colonel Guilford to open his mouth and his heart on so favorite a theme. Mrs. Latimer smiled in her heart, but did not betray it in her face, while she wondere wwhy Constance had been brought to school at all. It was a great compliment to herself to suppose that she could teach anything to this' paragon. But by listening attentively, and slippingl in an occasional ques- tion, she obtained all tie informaltion she wanted, including an insight into the character and position of the parents, whichl she knew how to use. It had been a long time since Colonel Guilford had been so communicative to any one out of his own household. At length lie again apologized for detaining her so long,. But Mrs. Latimner said, "Pray do not let that disturb you. I will take care that Miss Guilford loses nothing of her attainmients, especially in the continental tongues, and will strive to add something' of value on such points of her eddcation as tmay have been overlooked." Sle then seized the occasion to dilate on the essentials of educatioi, men- tal, moral, and physical, with much eloquence, adroitly adapting her views to the opinions of him she addlessed. She Inade a most favorable impression on Colonel Gnilford for this art had been the study of' her life; and he took leave of Constance with as light a heart as the necessity of leaving' her behind allowed. We meet with a diffliculty in the education of our daugh. 7 i^   &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7202-00000038"/> t4        SA IS'T CE CIL IA . ters which we do not experience in that of our sons. We are more liable to deceive ourselves and to be misled by others, as to botl the objects and method of education, il the former than in the latter case. The thorougihness and value of the education of the youth is tested in mainhood by the requisitions made on him in his subsequtent career. The barrister untrained to logical precision and lucid expla- nation, the clergyman wanting' in theological and ethical learning, the statesman ignorant of national institutions and political principles, the engineer not familiar with matheniatical truths and physical laws, the physician igno- rant of physiology and materia medica, the merchant not versed in book-keeping and comlmercial usages, no sooner come in contact with their fellows in the real business of life than they are detected and exposed. These plrofes- sional tests reflect back upon, and direct the training of, the rising generation. Not that bovys should be taught -in early youth the professions of their manhood ; but the aim of a liberal education is to give such at development to all the mental powers, such habits of thought and such appa- ratus for acquiring knowledge and skill, as will aid them in mastering the profession they may embrace. And public examinations and the competition for academic prizes at once exhibit the progress they have made, tend to prepare them for the demands of their future calling, and give them a confidence not unsuited to theit sex. But right-thinking fathers and mothers imay well fehr that their daughters will lose more in acquiring the confidence and boldness necessary to enable them to exlilbit pullicly their powers and attainments, than could be gained through the un- blushing self-possession very ill suited to their sex. Notwithstanding the new revelations as to womlan's rights and duties, nature ordains tl!at with womenl a pro- fessional career must be an excepltional case. The only   SA iNT CECILIA.         75 professions equally open to bloth sexes are chiefly those which deal, not witlh the serious pursuits, but the diver- sions of life, as music and the stage. And even in these we see that the great dramatists and composers have been men, not women. Thhs we can seldom apply the profes- sional test to mleasure the fitness of a woman's education. Her future duties are not professional, but social, aud those- chiefly domestic; for most women marry, and we cannot foretell what may be the profession or condition of their husbands, which must influence and almost control their own positions and occupations. It is, perhaps, the lecrpcttual looking forward to marriage which exercises the worst influence on female education). For, although some women remain single from choice, many do so from neces- sity, or at least fron the wrant of lan advantageous offer of marriage, upon which a woman's success in life is thought chiefly to depend. Female education has, in consequence, a strong tendency to take for its chief, often its only end, the pleasing and attracting of the other sex. Manners, address, conversation, amusing and winning qualities and accomplishments become far more valued than any culti- vation of the powers and character whc fit them for the varied and serious duties of life. These views early influ- ence the daughters, still earlier the parents, and the teacher who would attain a profitable success must furnish tihe kind of' education which is sought. Women may have but a limited access to professional careers; )but thlere is one profession peculiarly appropriate to womnan,-the education of her own sex. She may call in the aid of' masters to tcach particular arts, under her superintendence. But no one thut a woman can properly elucate girls, and no one but a lads', young ladies.

In this Mrs. Latiler had achieved a solid success, and deserved to be recognized as a remarkable woman. She was the daughter of a physician of provincial celebrity, who had bestowed much pains and expense on her education. They were not thrown away. She had abilities, address, and no little ambition, and succeeded in taking a step upwardl by marrying a gentleman, the head of a family long important in the county. Her ambition thus gratified, she became the leader of society in the neighborhood. Her husband's estate was much incum- bered. At this time she was no financier, and had many expensive tastes; but before these could lead to any se rious embarrassment, Mr. Latiniec cut the matter short; he took to the turf more devotedly than ever, ruined hinmself speedily, and died soon after. Mrs. Latimer found herself a widow witl but slender provision for herself and two children. She had no means of keeping up the influence and importance essential to her happiness. Most women would have succumbed to this misfortune, and withdrawn into obscurity. Not so Mrs. Latimer. She hated obscurity; she would not let dleisaster drive her from the home of her prosperous days. Con- vinced that she had made many friends, she resolved to turn them to account, and this she could only do by re- maining among them. She boldly employed the remnant of her property in retaining possession of her spacious mansion and some ad- jacent farms, burdened with heavy mortgages. The mag- nificent stables, which almost outvied the house uiid had hastened her husband's ruin, were now remodelled within, divided into school and music rooms, and joined to the house   SA lAX (:  A C'CUIA.      7 by a gallery, She announced fatr and wide her intention to open a school for young ladies. Her widow's weeds had lost nothing' of their freshness when she returned the numerous; visits of condolence paid her. While exhibiting a pro)per sense of tihe afflictions which lhad fallen upon her, she expressed her resolution to make the remaining' years of her life mlorle useful thian the past. She had long felt, she said, a vocation to the occupation shte was about to engage in, and discoused so eloquently and judiciously on female education that her hearers were convinced of, if they had ever doubted, her peculiar fitness for it While thus making skilful use of her personal influence, the circular in which she set forth the claims of her school was a .model for such compositions. She began by dis- avowing' the frequentl pretension to teach the whole circle of the arts and sciences, which, she said, ended in leaving the p)tiDil ignora ) t of pril ciples, and familiar only wilh i lnaes. Yet, on looking over her curriculum, it was difficult to say' what she had omitted. She expressed her conviction that' most young persons have an aptitude for some par- ticular attainment, and her aim would be to discover and develop the latent talent in each case, without neglecting the ordinary routine of instruction. But she undertook to teach nothing in less than a' year, and would receive no pupil for a less time; for, as she said, education is not legerdemain, and thorough training was her motto. She limited the number of her pupils, taking- care that this number should fill her spacious house; and( she declined receiving the daughter of her next neighbor unless domi- ciliated with her and completely under her control. 'She assumed that the great object in 'educating girls was to train them up ladies, and modestly insinuanted her peculiar fitness for the task. While professing to rely chiefly on her personal exertions, she dilated on the capacities of the   &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7202-00000040"/> 78        SAINT CECILIA.  assistants whose services she had secured. She descanted eloquently on the relations of mental, moral, and physical training, and on the advantages of Latitner Lodge, with its spacious grounds, its healthy site, and its rural privacy, for all the purposes of feinale education. The novelty of this enterprise: a fine .lady opening her school in a mansion worthy of a man of fortune, secured immediate success;' and her address and ability made that success permanent. It is a gross error' to imagine that the teacher's chief difficulty lies in influencing( and con-, trolling the pupils. The great art consists in the skilful manipulation of the parents. Mrs. Latimer knew what education was ; but the confidence of the parent must be won before the education of the child can be begun. She knew that parents usually judge of the progress of their daughters' education by the acquisition of the more mani- fest exterior accompliishments, rather than the mental or moral training, which are not so obvious. And in the matter of education you must promise people a great deal or they, will expect nothing from you, and patronize those who take care to excite greater hopes. Mrs. . Ltimer was not so much her own enemy as to be unwilling to deceive people for their own good. She knew that it was the gilding, not the gold, that was wanted, and she labored to give them plenty of gilding for their money, even if much of the gold was sacrificed to that object. No parent or guardian came to nmake inquiries at her school without Mrs. Latimer's taking care that, like tonel Guilford; he or she should have an accidental interview with some of her most attractive pupils. This had many ad- vantagcs. Mrs. Latimer, thus found an opportunity of contrasting the raw material she was expected to work up with the best samples of the finished article which had passed through her skilful hands. For this purpose she   SA 1INT CECIL A.        79 selected her best-looking and best-bred girls, antd par- ticularly those who were of families of ,some note; for all these points had an influence with the visitor. The young ladies thus used by her were brought forward under the plea of forling their manners, teaching them how to receive company, to entertain strangers, and make an agreeable impression, which of course precluded' giving' any unfavorable impression as to Latimer Lodge. To be so employed was viewed as a flattering mlark of confidence on Mrs. Latilmer's part. Thus, while the advances made by these accomplished young ladies relieved the embarrass- ment of the new scholar, and occupied her attention, Mrs. Latimer, who was not only an admirable talker but a skilful inquisitor, had an opportunity of discoursing with the plarent on her system of education, of drawing out the opinions and character of the visitors, and of ascertaining on what points in education they laid most stress. She knew well how to feel er way into their opinions, and would then bring forward such of her views as would conl- mand their ready assent. To one who set no value on drawing and painting, or music, she would say, "When we would add something' to the essentials of education, we should consult the aptitudes of the pupil. Why should a girl without an ear for music waste money and more precious time in becoming' an indifferent peformer? Or one to whom nature has denied an observing eve and accu- rate hand, spend hours in staining good paper or canvas with caricatures of nature?" The parent would be at times led to point out some particular deficiency, oftener some peculiar ability, real or imagined, in her child. To over- come the one, or develop the other, or to seem to do so, would be Mrs. Latimer's aim ; for this would secure the good report of the parent. This plainstaking' lady always made a note of tlese little conferences to guide her in her \  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7202-00000041"/> future correspondence with the parent. Her ready pen  did her good service in that employment.  : Mrs. Latimer's youth had been little marked by devo-   i tion. She had indeed become tainted with an unscriptural  philosolphy itnlibed from her father, who, like many llmen i engrossed by physical science, was a flree-thinker, unincum- bered with a Creed. But now in her maturer years, and  in so responsible a position, she had become a zealous daugihter of the church. Studiously selecting a central seat equidistant from Methodism and that novelty, Oxford Tractarianism, she did not fail to anathematize both ex cathedra in the most orthodox terms. Nor was her reli- gion of a passive character. It had nothing of quietismi aDout it, but took the energetic form of enforcing upon all under her charge an exact attention to all religious observances. During the services of the church, or the devotions of the household, she was never so much engrossed by the fervor of her own devotions but that her vigilant eye hovered as a guardian angel over her well-drilled flock, and detected the slightest neglect of " external religion." Such was the lady who now put Constance under the charge of her housekeeper, to show her to a chamber and attend to her personal wants. The hum and bustle in the house at length announced that the school was out. The diinner-bell rang soon after, and Constance was shown thie way to the dining-rooth, Vwhere one of the voutng ladies who had entertained her in the drawing-room now took charge of her. More than seventy girls were assembled here, seated at four tables. Those for the younger girls were presided over by an assistant telacher at each end. 5But Mrs. Latimer tool chlarge of the elder girls, among whom Constance found a place. A tall footman -in livery, a remnant of her former state, stood behind Mrs. Latimer's chair and received her orders, while   neat servant-maids waited on the tables. The meal was well served, the materials good, but by no mealls sluper- abundant. All the proprieties of the table were strictly observed. Mrs. Latimer conversed freely with those near her and encouraged conversation, for conversation is tho most essential part of education ; and Constance was soon put at her case by the polite attention paid her. The meal was not hurried, and even the youngest girl was not suf- fered to leave the table until Mrs. Latimer gave the signal for rising, and then all left the room in a well-bred manner.  But no sooner were they out of it than the younger giils ran through the house into the shrubbery, followed more sedately by their seniors and several of the teachers. Constance, who went with them, now observed that amid the shrubbery, which consisted of hardy plants not easily injured, there were broad gravel-wallis, many rustic scats, and several lawns well adapted to various out-of-door amusements. The girls formed themselves into various groups, according to the diversion or occupation which attracted them ; and Constance was struck with the ample and varied provision made to encourage exercise and diversion. She soon learned that it was an essential point in Mrs. Latimer's system lt6 induce the girls to take part in active sports, from the battledoor and shuttlecock, and the hoops and wands of the graces, up to the bowling- green and the billiard-table. But this last was reserved for inclement weather, and for the higlest forms, and the assistant teachers, nearly all of whom had been formerly her pupils. Mrs. Latimer, a graceful woman of, fine person, often discoursed charmigly of calisthenics. Gym nastics, in the usual sense, she considered unsuited to the sex. She based her system on the sound conviction that all ex- ercises best served their purpose when the immediate object  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7202-00000042"/> 82        SAINT CcECI [A., was, not exercise, but diversion. She took pains to induce each pupil to join ill them, particularly where there was aln- defect in the health or carriage of the individual which some exercise might tend to reform. Her watchfulness in this resplect was admirable. If her keen eye detected any awkward habit or untidiness in a pupil, she would take her aside and point out how unbecoming this was in a young lad, how much it detratted from the agreeable im- pression she otherwise made; showing so much kindly feeling and interest in the girl that her hints were seldom thrown awav. Careful of the person, manners, and carriage, she did not neglect the mind. And here she never taxed any girl with stupidity. It was always indolence or negligence that was complained of. The dtullest girl was told: "You may not be as quick as such a one," naming a promising pupil, " in this or that study, but there are things that you can do better than she can, if you tried." Each girl was thus en- couraged to believe that she lhad talents worth improving. Her girls, she habitually said, were her jewels ; and, like the skilful jeweller, s!he strove to give them the highest polish and the most becoming setting they could receive. Perhaps it was this habit of viewing her girls as rough diamonds sent to her to be ground and polished, tnd set to the lest advattage, which led her to care little if tleir hearts became harder than the nether millstone. We have heard that many minerals, soft enouI'h in their native beds, become indurated by exposure to the atnmsptleric and other influences of this upper world. Beingl neither mnason, mineralogist, nor lapidary, we cannot say how far Mrs. Latimer's system contributed to tis ihardening effect. Her part was to make her jewels soft yet brilliant to the eye. Constance presently saw Mrs. Ilatimer sauntering over the grounds, throwing a watchful glance at the groups as   SAINT CECILLA.         83 she passed them. She soon drew near to her new scholar, and invited her to walk in the garden with her. This Constance found large and well kept; for, although tie scholars had access to it, a vigilant old Scotch gardener was at hand to cheek depredations. While strolling from alley to alley, Mrs. Latimer drew Constance into conversa- tion, which, beginning' in gardening, gradually slid into a skilfully-disguised examination as to her attainments, and ant adroit inquisition into her personal and family history. Constance's intelligence and frankness made this, on most points, an easy task, and Mrs. Latimer soon knew enough for her purpose. She inferred that Colonel Guilford, al}though a man of high birth, was not a man of fortune; tlhat he had no intercourse with his relatives, and had for some reason been east oil' by them. She attributed the wife's long residence abroad in evident obscurity to the want of money and of advantageous connections at home. 3But it had obviously led to the high cultivation of the daughter's rare capacity, and made her thorouglly at home in two foreign tongues. Among Mrs. Latimer's many talents, she put none to greater profit than her skill in making use of every one who came within her reach. Shle saw that the patronage or good word of the Guilfords would be of little value to her, and that Constance, from her age and proficiency, would not remain. long at the school ; so Mrs. Latimer resolved to make use of her now. "Your long residence abroad, my dear," she said, " will prove an inestimable advantage to you, if you do not throw that advantage away. Through our growing intercourse with our continental neighbors, we are overcoming our narrow insular prejudices. More particularly the English mind is beginning to appreciate justly the intellectual treasures locked up in the German tongue, as in a casket  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7202-00000043"/> not easily opened. Indeed, much of this treasure cannot be transferred from it, for there is much in every language  which cannot be translated. I greatly regret not having  acquired the Gernan language as early and thoroughly as  that of IFrance. But you are very vountr," she added,   i turning with a motherly interest to Constance, " and your father's fears are well founded, that you may lose- your famililaity with these tongues by neglecting to use thelm. Of coursei7, she continued with a smile, " we will not pre- tend to teach you, but we will give you the best opportunity of keeping up the use of them. You will join the highest form in both French and German. It will be no task to you, yet will give you occasion to use both languages, particularly if you speak to your classmates in them, and exact compliance with the rule that requires them to reply in the sane. As you are not now at Dijon or Dresden;  you must endeavor to create a little circle around you speaking French and German. Most of the young ladies are anxious to master these tongues, but with as little labor as possible. None of us refuse knowledge, we only grudge paying the price. Now conversation is a living book, which teaches language more easily and speedily than grammar, dictionary, and books of phrases. More- over, your father tells me that, as your long residence abroad has made you a stranger in your own land, you should now strive to make as many friends here as possible. You will have it in your power to assist and benefit your companions, and save them a vast deal of trouble, by smoothing the difficulties in their way, particularly if you are resolute in observing and enforcing my rule, that during the hours of study they use one of the languages they pro- fess to learn. This will give you an influence and value in the eyes of your companions which you should on no account throw away." I   "1'\ (' JCUiA^.       O 85 Constance had an abundance of vanity and ambition, and was much pleased with the idea of malking herself so useful and important. She readily promised hCer aid in Spurring on her companions to the acquisition of these tongues, not foreseeing the trouble and embarrassment it might cause her. Mrs. Latimer's discourse to Constance was not exactly whsat she whispered to herself. She knew that Chaucer's criticism on the language of his Prioress was not vet out of dite rwhen applied to English schools, her ow\n almong th e numbel,---- "And Flrcncle she shpalc full fayre and fetisly, After the scole of Stratford atte bowe, For Frenchc of Paris was to hire unknowe." Mrs. Latimer did indeed nominally employ a French and a German master. But both of them lived four miles off, in the town of H-- , and, most of their time being em- ployed in schools there, each of them only gave Mrs. Lati- mer two hours twice a week. Slhe thus enjoyed the advantage of their reputation as teachers, and they at- forded indeed standards of correctness in the use of their languages. But the two did not give as much time to Latimer Lodge as that graceful gentleman who attended, violin in hand, anld, while they trained the tongue, under- took the education of the feet. But we do injustice to this professional gentleman. His sphere of duties em- braced the whole science of motion, gracc, and deport- ment. he was a dignitary at Latimer Lodge. The real labor of teaching French fell on Mrs. Latimer and some of her subalterns. That of German on a young assistant, whom she had well crammed with grammar, colloquies, and other text-books, up to a point which enabled her to 8.  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7202-00000044"/> 86        SAINT CECILIA.  keep a little ahead of even a clever and enterprising pupil. Thus Mrs. Latilmer found in Constance an unlooked-for prize, -and she was not of a temper to throw away the gifts of fortune. A young and manageable girl, speaking French and German as if "to the Imanor born," with plenty of entertaining matter to tell and ask about, familiar with what was new to her companions, and ignorant of Imuch with which they were familiar, bent too on encouraging the use of those tongues for her own convenience, as well as for the benefit of her classmates, was a duplex professor, with the peculiar merit of demanding no salary, instead of double pay. But fearing that she might lead Constance to think too highly of her own attainments, Mrs. Latimer now said, "We must not forget that a thorough mastery of our own language is more to us than a familiarity witl two or three foreign tongues. We have a deeper interest in it, and in the literature embodied on it, both from its wealth and from its being our own. It would be an absurd education that neglected it." To the voung ladies under lMrs. Latimer's charge this wealth of English literature was chiefly represented by the ponderous tomes of "Elegant Extracts," compiled by Vicesimnus Knox, and Doddls "Beauties of Shakspeare," which, torn from the context, lose half their beauty and point. Milton's Paradise Lost, and Thomson's Seasons, were also put on frequent duty, the girls being made to parse and commit to memory long passages of blank verse, until they devoutly wished that the seasons would never come round again, and that Milton's Paradise was forever lost. When Mrs. Latimer met with a girl who was really clever and well taught, she took great pains to convince her, not only that she had still much to learn, but that   SAINT CECI IA.         87 she, Mrs. Latimer, was the source from which this addi- tional knowledge could be best derive(d. i 1 infer, from what you tell me as to your education,' she said, that the exact sciences, the mathematics, and that which is dependent upon them, have been somewhat overlooked. Beginning with the science of numbers, which we call arithmetic,"t-but, seeing, a smile on Con- stance's lips, she added,-" you may not be deficient tlhere. But how is it with geometry, the science of form and proportion, and that universal arithmetic, called al- gebra?'" Constance admitted her ignorance of them, and Mrs. Latimer continuedt "It may seem strange to you that I should lay stress on such abstruse studies for young ladies. I hav'e neitler expectation nor wish that any of my girls should become asstronomers or women of science. My object is only to train the mind and develop its powers. From olur sensitive and impulsive nature, not from any inferiority of intellect (although I admit an in- tellectual difference), we wromen are more apt than men to draw hasty conclusions, following the guidance of feel- ing rather thian reason. This tendency to reason illogi- cally and act from impulse is best counteracted by habitu- ating the mind to the operations of pure reason, and this is founl in geometrical dcemonstration. I lay less stress on algebra, whch, althou gh it taxes the ingeluity, and compels the mind to cast about for-tlhe solution of a difii- culty, and is invaluable, nay, indlisDensable in mlany sciin- tific investigations, yet is not to be compared with geome- try as an instirument for mental training.

But there  never has been nor can be great mental progress, or high  civilization, without elaborate inquiry into the relations of number, quantity, and form." As Constance had listened to her with great attention and full faith, almost as if Ilerr Rhodomtan had been speaking, Mrs. Latimer thought that she had sulliciently impressed upon her the high and broad views she herself' took of education, and her peculiar ability to conduct it. So she returned to a more practical point. Your education abroad has estranged you fro your own people. You must make up for time lost. Our warmest and most lasting friends are those we make in youth. There are many girls here who, from their-birth and connections, may prove valuable friends to you through life. It is our duty to make all the friends we can, particularly such as may be useful to us; for our own utility will depend much on the friendships we make.' No one had a better right to preah on this text than Mrs. Latimer, who had faithfully put her precept into practice. No one better knew how to make use of her friends. "I will make you the room-mate of a girl of your own age,--a little older indeed. In truth, I have no other vacant place for you. She is not perhaps a11 you could wiih in a friend. But she has her merits, and, from the position of her family, she may be very useful to you, if you make yourself useful and agreeable to her. Miss Meredith was a spoiled child at home, and perhaps has not quite got over the effects of ill training, or rather the utter want of early training. But her father, who is an especial friend of our family, is anxioUS that she should have every advantage that education can give.

You can speak to her, habitually in French, and accustom her to hear the langulage and to reply in it. You can practice with her in music, and form her ear and touch to correct- ness, feeling, and taste. You are altogether her superior in mind and cultivation, and will necessarily exercise great influence over her; and I will make it my business that Sir Watkins Gw'nn Meredith shall know how much hs daughter owes to you. She is still somewhat indolent, and at times somewhat wilf'ul. But," shea added, looking full at Constance, "you will doubtless feel your own superiority, in all but the adventitious gifts of fortune; and mere whim anld wilfulness must yield to a settled purlpose andn a stronger will. In telling vou all this I am seeking to advance your cducation in the best way, by forming your character. You can be a valuable friend to Miss Meredith, and thus make her and her fiather your frieinds. You must not call this a cold calculation There is doubtless such a thing as spontaneous, uncalcu- lating friendship. We see it in others, and," laying her hand emphatically on her heart, " we feel it in ourselves. But as we grow older we find that to make ourselves useful is the best way of making friends." Mrs. Latimer's philosophy had a savor of worldliness to Constance, yet it recalled to her mind siome 1remnarks of her parel'ts. Mrs. Latimer had pumned Colonel Guilford well, and tlad now merely given a more practital character to the art of making friends. Constance was flattered at this lady's high appreciation of her, and at the frankness 8'  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7202-00000046"/> 90        SAINT CECILIA. with which she laid open her mind. She readily promised to make herself useful to her room-mate, and make a friend of her if possible, which she did not doubt. It needed no calculation to induce her to throw her bread upon the waters, without watching for its return after many days or few. Mrs. Latimer might well say that mere wilfulness bad no chance of winning the day against a settled purpose and a strong will. Sir Watkins Gwynn Meredith was a. man of large fortune and great influence inl an adjoining Welsh county. He had several soils, but only one dalughter, whom he was anxious to endow with every qualification for becoming the reigning belle of Radnorshire and be. vond its bounds. She must not only ride after the houlnds, but sing Italian and chatter Flrenc ; he could teach her the first, but had not patience to look after her education further than to engage governess after governess, with the highest recommendations and proportionate salaries, each of' whom failed to acquire any control over her pulil, and after being worried half to death by the daughtcr, was discharged by the father in a summary way Sir Watkins at last remembered the widow of his sport- insg companion, whom his example, and his better luck on the turf, had helped to ruin. He at once put his daughter, then about thirteen, into his coach, and drove off to Lati- mer Lodge. Hle eyed the magnificent stables there, with which he was familiar, with nmuch curiosity, knowing th use to which they had been perverted. lie then held a conference with Mrs. Latimer, in which he proved his i frankness, and did not flatter his child. Mrs. Latimer at once conceived the idea of getting back ns much as she could of the large sumts he ihad won trom l her husband. She gave Sir Watkins to nndLrstand that such a girl as he described would give more trouble than   SAINT CECILIA.         91 a dozen ordinary pupils; besides being well paid, she would answer for her education only on condition that she was put altogether underl her control. Sir \Watkins had a short temper and a long purse, and gave her carte blanche as to both authority and expense. Onl turning his daugl- ter over to her, he said, "I leave you a filly hard to break, but such, you know, prove the best when thoroughly broken in." In the course of four years, Mrs. Latimer lhad been so successful in modifying her pupil's temper, polishing her manners, and spIurriing on her not delicient ,parts, and under the precepts and drill of her skilful trainer, the young lady behaved so well during the holidays, that Sir Watkins was delighted at Mrs. Latimer's metamor;phic powers; he trumpeted her praises far and wide, and did not limit his gratitude to words. He continued 4lo send his daughter back to the Lodge, and Mrs. Latimer con- tinued to exert her skill on her, well knoewing that what- ever culture or accomplishmecnt she should bestow on tlis especial pupil was sure to bring profit as well as praise. Having attained the object of her conference with Con- stance, Mrs. Latimer did not bring it abruptly to an end. Leading her through the garden, she turned the conversa.- tion to plants and flowers. Finding that Constance, al- though no florist, had someC knowxledge of botany, she said, "I am glad to find that your taste has ledtiyou in that direction. Every one should study the physiology of some portion of the material world in whiich we live; and of all branches of natural history, botany is best suited to our sex, being most compatible with the posi. tions d   ptons an occ s of Nwomen. I trust you will perse- vere in so aDpropriate a pursuit.7' Leadling Constance back to the playground and leavinog her with the other girls, Mrs. Latimer went off to com-  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7202-00000047"/> plete the arrangements she contemplated. The young girl who had been Miss Meredith's room-mate was transferred to an apartment with girls of her own age, nothing loath to escape fromn a tyrannical companion. rTop Miss Mere- dith Mrs. Latimer pointed out the peculiar advantage slie would enjoy from hlaving Constance ever at hand to smooth her way in the studies in which she was deficient, and on which her exacting father laid so much stress; and this young lady, now pretty well broken in to the conduct which policy dictated, wts dispatched to make, Constance's acquaintance, and induct her into their coimmon chaminer. Meanwhile Mrs. Latinmer sought out the assistant who taught the German classes. To her she said, "You know, Miss Sanford, how little of Mr. ltIoffmlan's time I have been able to secure to our school, so that the duty of teaching German falls chiefly on us, and especially on you. And you and I know," slic added, with a smile, "the im- portance of not letting pupils doubt the proficiency of their teachers; yet there is not a shopboy in Berlin or Dresden from wlom we could not learn much. The new scholar who arrived this morning is a highly intelligent girl, and, by long residence on the continent, has learned to speak both French and German as her mother-tongue. Her father is anxious that she should lose none of this proficiency by want of use." She then proceeded to give Miss Sanford precise instructions how to avail herself of Constance's aid without comp)romnising her own authority as teacher. Thus was Constance fully entered in Mrs. Latimer's school, ostensibly as a scholar, really as a teacher, and pay- ing heavily for this privilege. Had Mrs. Latimer's con- science raised a. protesting voice against this metamor- phosis, she would have silenced it with the conclusive answer, that she herself had found teaching one of the   best ways of learning; nor would it be easy to refute this assertion. But to compensate Constance for her valuable services, Mrs. Latimer promised herself that she would be- stow especial attention on this young girl ill those braineies in which she might be deficient. CIIAPTER      VIII. "O, and is all forgot? All schooldays' friendship---- vWe Hare with our ncelds created both one flower, Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbling of one song, both in one key; As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds,-- hIad been incorporate. So we grew together, Like to a double cherry, seeming parted."  MlDSuasUMtE:-NtcnT' D nREAf. Much as it grieved Constance to be separated from the mother she had never before left, and the father she had so lately recovered, she was sustained by the desire to  fulfil their wishes, and eager to avail hlerself of the ad- vantages they sought to afford her. A boarding-school is a little world in itself,-with its own interests, incidents and excitements,-and she soon found herself fully occu- pied, for Mrs. Latitimer hatd the art of keeping her girls employed -in studies and amnusemenits, whtich allowed no  itte for moping. Moreover, Constance was. ambitious, an.- the opportunity she now had of bringing her talents and attainments to lteati) upon her companions gratified the anity in which she was not wanting. Ms. Latimer set the example of speaking to her always in French, mag-  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7202-00000048"/> nanimously admitting that her own accent was not fault- less, but that she was not too old to learn. The assistant teacher, who had been crammed with a modicum of Ger- man, was directed to converse, and to require her scholars to converse, with Constance only in that tongue. All this tended to increase Constanee's importance in her coin- panions' eyes and her own. 1But it tended to cut ler off from easy, social intercourse with the girls of her own age. They were not disposed to receive on an intimate and confidential footing one who-by Mrs. Latimer's adroit management-occupied the position of a teacher in two of their most difficult studies. Earnest and enthusi- astic in all she unIdertook, Constance thoughtt that her companions ouight to feel a like zeal in the acquisition of knowledge. She was by no means indulgent to indolence. Moreover, she had come late to school, after the inti- macies and friendships of school-life had been already formed among the elder girls, who, as the time drew near when their education and the restraints attending it were soon to terminate, were looking cagerly beyond the walls of Latimer Lodge to the freedom and pleasures of home and earlv womanhood. These topics made the staple of their conversation in their leisure hours, ,and Constance was dazzled by many a brilliant picture of their future life, adorned with not a few exaggerations as to the style in which they would move. With this was mingled no little inquisitiveness as to the hlome and family of their new companion; for it was rumored through the school that Constance was of a noble family. lBtt twhen, after the examplle of her parents, she avoided entering on a family history. of which sle knew few particulars, and could refer t to no home but her father's quarters in the fortress of   c Valetta, of which she knew nothing, very unfavorable     f constructions were put on her shyness on these topics.   Both Colonel Guilford and his wife were aware that they had become too much isolated from the world. One strong inducement in sending Constance to Latimer Lodge was the opportunitv she would there have of forming friend- ships with girls of her own agre and standing. But through out the world companionship is common, friendship is rare, and the former usurps the place of the latter without filling it. Without intending it, Mrs. Latimer's selfish policy had plut a bar between Constance and her com- panions. Shet thus found no congenial spirit among tem who could tempt l    ,er to open freely her thoughts, much less to lay bare her heart.  Her letters to her mother were the only vent she found for the feelings generated in the recesses of that hearlt, and she carefully abstained from alluding to all that was irksome in her situation at the Lodge., Accustomed to a life of freedomn, she felt the confinemelnt of her present life. Earnest and laborious in tile hours of study, she felt the nee'd of contrast in her diversions. Womanly in thought and purpose, she was. a child in simplicity and vivacity. The impulse of reation from mental labor, and the craving for active and vigorous bodily exertion, gradually ied her to take a part and a lead in the games and sports of the younger and more joyous girls, who did not yet think themselves young ladies, and she soon became a favorite with them. But much of her leisure l as spent in, the gaden, less frequented than the playground.  When alone there her slow palce and meditative look at one time, at anotller her rapid gait and animated face, often accompanied by earnest gestures of the hand and arm, betrayed the varying moods of a thoughtful, impassioned, enthusiastic spirit roaming freely through realms created by her own imagination. One might suppose that Mrs. Latimer, in accordance  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7202-00000049"/> g96     hSA INT CECILIA. with her usual policy, would have made great use of Constance as a decoy to visiting parents who were seek- ing a school in which their daughters might be trained to intelligence, accomplishmcnt, grace, and beauty, trans- formed in short firom the chrysalis to the butterfly. But Mrs. Latimer, for good reasons, kept Constance in the background. She had just come into her hands, and could not be exhibited as a sample of her skill. Moreover, while Mrs. Latimer was in the habit of speaking somewhat grandiloquently of the efficiency of her corps of teachers, and she had now made Constance essentially one of it, she always took care to appropriate any peculiar pro- ficiency in her pupils to her own skill and attention. -Nor was this claim without foundation. Her peculiar system gave her a thorough knowledge of scholars and teachers, and of all that went on in her school. She did not allow her own time to be engrossed by any particular branch; but employed teachers numerous enough to attend to every study of every form. Her habit was occasionally to supply a teacher's place, or, more usually, to take her seat beside her, watch the progress of recitation and instruction, ex- acting attention, explaining difficulties, and afterward privately. pointing out to her assistant any defects she remarked in her method of teaching. It would seem strange that she could afford the expense of so many assistants, or find thenm of a temper so compliant to her system of drill; but she did this easily and cheaply. The greater part of her scholars indeed were the daugh- ters of people in good circumstances, for her school was an expensive one; but there were others whose prospects in life were not so bright: chiefly the daughters of clergymen and other professional ien of narrow means. Great efforts, perhaps painful sacrifices, had often been made to send them to Mrs. Latimer's school; for it had been in high   SAIINP' CECILIA.        9 repute for some years. With many of these girls their education was their fortune. They were learning in order to teach. Mrs. Latimer did not overlook this class. She might be said to pay them special attention. She pro- fessed to set the qualifications of -a teacher very high, and to be chary of giving recommendations as governesses. Full credentials she gave to those only who had proved themselves able to teach as well as to learn; for, as she truly said, teaching is itself an art. Such credentials could only be obtained by one, two, or tlree years spent as an assistant in her school; and it was but to the more com- petent of tier late pupils that she would offer a place, with a compensation not burdensome to her purse. She thus obtained assistants who were not merely able but cheap, and pliant to 'her rule. She often went further than this. It not seldomi happened that some well-advanced and promis- ing girl was about to be withdrawn from school from sheer want of means to maintain here there. Mrs. Latimer, divining the cause, would show great regret that so promis- ing a course should be broken off, and would delicately suggest to the parents that rather than have her pupil lose the opportunity of completing her education, she her- self would be content to wait for her money, if secured fromn ultimate loss. In several cases she thus bound a capa- ble teacher to her service through the legal obligation of the parent, which obligation this service, at a low salary, very slowly discharged. Sh e thus obtained valuable service for small pay, and a reputation for charity to boot. When Mrs. Latimer found that she could not further prolong the apprenticeslip to the art of teaching, she would exert herself to obtain excellent places as govern- esses for her proteyees. This her high reputation enabled her to do, and she would then hold up their success to 9  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7202-00000050"/> 98        SAINT CECILIA. their successors as examples of her zeal and power to patronize merit. She thus got well and cheaply served by the skilful application of Colonel Charteris's golden rule, to pay a penny in cash and a shilling in promises. Seldom did one, on whom she had laid her hand, escape before she had done good service for a long term. Yet some gave her the slip, most frequently by entering the matrimonial gate. And here we may remark that few, even of those pupils whose worldly prospects were most clouded, looked forward to the laborious career of teaching for a living, and with that view applied themselves assiduously to learn all she could teach them. Youth, hope, and love will not be divorced. Nine out of ten looked forward to an early and advan- tageous marriage to relieve them from so tame a life; and visions of lovers, wealth, and wedded happiness peered from behind the dull page of grammar or arithmetic, and sadly confused the task. Constance had attracted Mrs. Latimer's attention more strongly than any girl who had been put under her charges and she had her much with her in the evening. She was curious to know the condition of her parents. From the peerage she learned that Colonel Guilford was the second son of the late, and the only brother of the present, Lord Far- ingdon; yet without questioning Constance she drew from her that her father had little or no intercourse with either his own or his wife's relatives. Constance's incidental allusions to her previous life implied somewhat narrow circumstances in her parents. Her wardrobe, although neat and tasteful, was far from costly, and her habits indi- cated that, unlike most of the other girls, she had little inclination to spend money, or little money to spend. She was soon so useful to Mrs. Latimer that she began to cast about for the means of prolonging her stay at the Lodge.   SAINT CECILIA.         99 She treated her with almost maternal affection and con- fidence, and wrote one of her diplomatic letters to Colonel Guilford, expressing the deep interest she felt in his daugh- ter; her satisfaction at her intellectual progress, and her fascinating qualities. But she took care to remind him that she was just at the age when the constitution and char- acter are in the process of formation; and she lauded his wisdom in keeping her away from a climate and society so disadvantageous to a young girl as Malta, and the idle and dissolute military circle assembled there. Miss Meredith, Constance's room-mate, had been well schooled by Mrs. Latimer as to the importance of reaping all the benefit she could from having constantly at her elbow one so well able to smooth the path of learning. She felt, too, the superior force of her companion's char- acter, and exhibited toward her a pliancy and amiability for which no one had given her credit. Her industry was chiefly displayed in the acquisition of the French language and in music, for on these points her father, and, conse- quently, Mrs. Latimer, was especially exacting. She sub- mitted to Constance's requisition that they should habitu- ally converse in French; and Constance submitted to the irksome task of practising with her on the piano-forte, and in singing. Miss Meredith, having a tolerable voice ancdear; caught some of her companion's correctness and expres- sion. The peculiar sweetness and compass of her voice she could not imitate. At this time, however, Constance gave little time to music. The perpetual babel of sounds fromn a dozen different instruments, in as many small rooms ad- jacent to each other, seemed to disgust her with the art which she perhaps loved best. Thls her peculiar powers, although not unobserved, did not attract the attention they merited. Miss Meredith's favorite topic of conversation was the  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7202-00000051"/> 100        SAINT CECILIA. splendor and diversions of Llangynnoc House, and the gay company that resorted to it. Impressed by Mrs. Latimer with the use she might make of Constance, she at once sought to influence her through a selfish motive, for she knew no other. While she indulged her vanity in boast- ing of the wealth and importance of the Merediths, and longed for an opportunity to exhibit their stately mansion and wide domain to one who had no home, she hoped to bribe Constance into compliance and usefulness by the prospect of a long and joyous holiday amid the luxury and gayety of Llangynnoc House. So she early asked and got leave from her father to bring this chosen com- panion with her. She longed for the holidays, when the escape from wearisome tasks, and the freedom and diver- sions of such a home, would be enjoyed witl redoubled zest with such a companion. She succeeded in inoculating Constance with her antici- pations of pleasure; for, although there was little of unison in temper or character between the two, thus as- sociated not by choice but chance, yet Constance had a large heart, prone to kindly feelings toward those who came in contact with it, and Llangynnoc House, as pic- tured by her friend, was so attractive after the monotony of Latimer Lodge, that she looked forward to the visit with as much pleasure as Miss Meredith herself. Con- stance promised herself the additional pleasure, keenly craved after long privation, of roaming through a pictur- esque region, and of sketching many a beautiful scene amid the Welsh mountains. For Constance, with her keen and cultivated sense of the beautiful and picturesque, felt acutely the interruption of her artistic studies. Mrs. Latimer had not indeed overlooked the graphic art in her course of instruction. The only female teacher whom she employed who was   SAINT' CECILI4.        101 not one of her former pupils, and who was fully paid, was a lady who drew well, and painted in water colors with much skill, that is, she copied well with both the crayon ,and the brush. But Constance had got beyond this, and 'had a contempt for water colors, as means inadequate to embody the conceptions of the, artist. She was more amused than instructed in witnessing the process of copy- ing copies, and the labor of the teacher in touching up and tinting over the chefs-d'euvre of her pupils, so as to raise theni to a mediocrity that might excite the admira- tion of " papa and mammla." Unguardedly betraying her opinion on these points, Constance had excited some bit- terness of feeling in the breast of Mrs. Nelson, who was less an artist than a skilful artisan. Shut out from the study of picturesque nature and models of high art, and wanting time, place, and appliances neces- sary for painting in oil, Constance had to lay aside the brush; but the crayon still employed some of her leisure hours. Cut off from a Nwider range of objects, the faces and forms of her companions naturally attracted her atten- tion. She found herself selecting subjects from among them, studying each lineament, and striving to catch each fleeting but characteristic expression. Yet she usually elaborated her studies without inducing her models to give her formal sittings, and selected them not so much on account of their beauty as of some peculiar trait of expres- sion. Mere likenesses they were not, as was indicated by the frequent criticism, that the portrait was like the original in a particular mood, or under some peculiar circumstances. But Constance was not fond. of exhibiting these produc- tions, and seemed to keep them with some ulterior view. Perhaps she was emulating Herr Rhodoman in making elaborate studies of the figures destined to a place in a great picture. 9*  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7202-00000052"/> 102        SAINT CECILIA. As she had little leisure, was choice in her models, and labored to attain a high success, her portfolio contained not more than a dozen of these studies when the long school term drew toward its end. Miss Meredith had seen with what zeal and industry Constance had worked at these productions of her pencil. She was especially taken with the full-length portrait of a young girl, whose innocent yet anilmated face and graceful person Constance was picturing with peculiar success. Gazing on the portrait before her, MAiss Meredith was seized with aI desire to be included in this gallery. Taller, more ma- ture, rounder in form, in high health, with a fair share of beauty, but not of a high order, she thought herself a far better model than this slight girl. She was surprised that Constance had never taken her likeness, and bluntly proposed that she should do so now. Constance looked up with a smile, and said, "Your father will doubtless soon have your portrait taken by a more skilful hand than mine. These are mere studies for my own improvement, nor am I always successful in taking likenesses. It is only when I can fasten on some peculiar characteristic expression that I succeed. In your case, and that of many others, I have never been able to do so, and will not make the attempt until I can."  "I am sure you would succeed, if you made the effort," said Miss Meredith. "But I see that one must stand high in your favor to get a place in your gallery." "N2either friendship nor mere beauty secutes a place here," said Constance, gayly tapping her portfolio. "Some peculiarity must seize upon me which awakens the imagi- nation and guides the hand." "All that," said Miss Meredith, "is but another name for preference." "Not so," answered Constance. "I have certainly no   SAINT CECILIA.        103 preference for this little witch." And she drew out a like- ness of one of the youngest girls in the school. "Yet I think I have been successful in expressing here the impish cunning and mischief which make her the torment of the house. 7 "It was mere whim that made you select her," said Miss Meredith. "But in that portfolio you have made many of your friends handsome in spite of themselves." Constance was busy in giving the last stroke to her piece. Seeing that her companion was not in a mood to be satisfied, she continued her work without further reply. Miss Meredith looked moody for a time, but did not return to the subject. The holidays were soon to come, and this young lady was more than ever engrossed by the pleasure they were to bring. She had just learned that it was to be a long holiday to her. She was older than Constance, having entered on her eighteenth year, and her father had written to say that she would not return to the Lodge. She now often broke in upon Constance's hours of study with fiesh details of the grandeur of Llangynnoc House, the freedom and pleasures they would enjoy, the number and rank of the visitors who would assemble there at the festive season of Christmas; and she succeeded in raising Con- stance's expectation to no commoh height. Constance felt some diffidence at making her debut into such a circle. Moreover, although in many respects still a girl, she was woman enough to remeimber that with her simple ward- robe she would scarcely be presentable in a great house full of fashionable guests. Taking the hint from what fell from Miss Meredith's lips, "At Llangvnnoe Iouse we will have to dress well to look like other people," she sent in a hurry for Miss Wilson, the village mantuatlaker, and held a consultation with ler, in which Miss Meredith  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7202-00000053"/> 104        SA4FNT CECILIL4. volunteered to take a prominent part. Sle urged elaborate preparation, in order that Constance might not be too far outshone, while Constance sought only not to be conspicu- ously wanting in the style of her costume. Until now, dress had not much occupied her attention. Indeed, she bad often bestowed more thought on the costume of a character she represented on canvas than on her own. But now this matter assumed great importance in her eyes, and it was only after two long consultations and the ex- amuination of a number of designs and materials, that the mantua-mnaker received definite orders, and an exhortation to use dispatch. Miss Wilson was not overburdened with work, and in a few days reappeared in Constance's room, prepared to dis- play on Constance's person the proofs of her industry and taste; and Miss Meredith was at hand. Her noted love of dress seemed to be particularly awakened on this occa- sion. The hackneyed assertion that- "Loveliness Needs not the foreign aid of ornament, But is, when unadorned, adorned the most," is not always true. Constance's beauty could not be denied; yet her rapid growth still exhibited the immaturity of her figure, and her life of mental labor, and the excite. ment of an enthusiastic temper, made this still more obvious. But the mantua-maker was an artist in her way, and was delighted to have so fine, a subject on which to exercise her art. Two or three simple dresses were tried on, ad- justed, and pronounced most becoming by the maker, and even Miss Meredith condescended to approve.  Miss Wilson now produced her chef-d'wuvre, richer in material, more elaborate in ornament, more ample in its folds ; and having arrayed Constance in it, requested her to walk up and down the roolm.   SAINT CEClLIA.         105 The drapery rich and full, yet well adjusted to a figure tall, erect, and symmetrical; the stately air with which Constance moved across the chamber, with her beautiful head so exquisitely set on the slender white neck, im- pressed the artiste with an admiration of something beyond her art. She gazed on Constance in silence, and Miss Meredith was silent too. This young lady, being fond of admiring herself, had furnished her room with a mirror such as is rarely seen in a boarding-school. The mantua-maker now requested Constance to place herself before it and admire what she saw:v; "For nature and art have done their best for you." Constance looked and blushed while gazing with girlish delight on her counterfeit self, so womanly in aspect. Miss Meredith looked on in silence, while the mantua-maker, hardly less pleased than Constance, continued talking away as she gave the last touch to'the arrangement of the dress. Suddenly her busy tongue and fingers cease their play. Constance receiving no answer to a casual question looked into the glass to see the cause. The mantua-maker was gazing in surprise on Miss'Meredith, and Constance, look- ing at the reflection of that young lady, was startled at tle expression of triumphant malevolence stamped on her face. ";Now indeed I could take her likeness!" thought Con- stance. "But, good God! can that look-betray the feelings of her heart?" While Constance yet gazed on this ill-bodiug image, Miss Meredith recollected herself, and to conceal her con- fusion now loaded the mantua-inaker with praises of her skill. She received them coldly and with a puzzled air, aind turned to listen to Constance's approval, more naturally and kindly expressed I The much-admired dress was taken off and put away with the others, the mantua-maker paid  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7202-00000054"/> 106        SAINT CECILIA. and dismissed, and Constance, leaving Miss Meredith by herself, went down-stairs, wondering what cause of offense she could have given her. She could find no solution to this mystery; nor did Miss Meredith in look, tone, or manner, again indicate any but the kindest feelings toward her. Yet Constance was sure that what had struck Miss Wilson, as well as herself, could not be a freak of her own fancy. The last day of the term was drawing to a close. Some of Mrs. Latimer's scholars, whose homes were not far distant, had already left the Lodge, when Miss Meredith came into the chamber and found Constance writing a letter. It was to her mother, and full of her anticipated enjoyments at Llangynnoc House. "I am going to pack my trunks," said Miss Meredith. 'Will you pack yours at once, or wait until night?" Constance put aside her letter, and as her wardrobe was less extensive, and her method and promptness greater, she soon finished, and left Miss Meredith in the confusion of packing. Even in Mrs. Latimer's well-ordered household, at the breaking up, when all the scholars and nearly all the teachers were on the wing, confusion reigned, and that lady was overrun with business the whole evening. Constance was seated, long after supper, in a parlor talking to a teacher and one of the elder girls, when Miss Meredith entered the room, took a seat by the lights, and began to read a letter. Presently she made a little start, and uttered an exclamation which attracted Constance's attention. "Iave you heard from home? Is your carriage come?" asked Constance. "Yes; it is at the inn in the village, and will be at the door by breakfast-time. But--" "But what?"Constance asked.   SAINT CECILIA.        107 "This is too provoking!"Miss Meredith exclaimed, angrily. "What is so provoking?" said Constance. "Why, papa writes here'-and she struck the letter vio- lently with the hand which did not hold it-"that his house is so crowded with guests that le will have to send me to my aunt's, in Caernarvonshire, the dullest place in Christendom I You would not be willing to go there with me, even if my aunt sent you the most pressing invitation." "I do not think I would," Constance answered in a dry, hard tone. The truth flashed upon her at once. The mys- tery was a mystery no longer. "This is abominable conduct in papa," Miss Meredith exclaimed loudly, and Constance's companions echoed the sentiment, but not so loudly. They were indeed astonished. They had heard much of the invitation to Llangynnoc iouse, and Constance in the pride of her heart had dis- played to them the new dresses prepared for the occasion. Sir Wlatkins's conduct disgusted them greatly. "I had promised myself so delightful a time," Miss Meredith continued, " especially as you would be with me. Now you are to be disappointed, and I sent into banish. ment." "Console yourself," said Constance, with an angry sneer. "I trust I shall survive the disappointment.

She saw the wondering looks of her companions, and not choosing to be questioned on this matter, rose to leave the room; but her effort at composure failed to hide the proud and angry spirit roused within her. !  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7202-00000055"/> 108        SAIN T CECIL IA. Miss Meredith did not come to bed until Constance was, or seemed to be, asleel. In the morning Constance rose and drcssed early, leaving Miss Mercdith sleeping. The company at breakfast was m uch thinned by the departures of the preceding afternoon. Constance often looked across the table to catch Miss Meredith's eye, but in vain. The meal was soon over; the bustle of depart. ure began. Among many, and some of them rather huimle vehicles, a handsome travelling -carriage, with coachman and footman in a rich livery, drove up to the door. Miss Meredith's luggage was placed on it, while she entered the drawing-room and took formal leave of Mrs. Latimer. She then ran down the steps and sprang into the carriage. The footman held the door open as if expecting another; but at an imperious word fron his young mistress he closed it, mounted to his seat, and the carriage rolled off at the speed of ten miles an hour. Constance was standing in the recess of a window, in the drawing-room, behind the curtain, watching the depart- ures. Her countenance wore a pained and sorrowful ex- pression; but she thought not of Llangynnoc Iouse, and the gay company that crowded it. The detection of such studied deceit and malignant treachery in one so young was a startling revelation. All the others had now left the room except Mrs. Latimer; and she, too, stood at a window, watching her departing pupils. When she saw Miss Meredith step into her carriage and drive off alone, she exclaimed, "Where is Constance? Where is Miss Guilford?"Turning round, she found herself alone, until Constance stepped out from behind the curtain. "How is this?"Mrs. Latimer asked. "I ow comes it that you have not gone with Miss Meredith?" "Miss Meredith told me that she had got a letter fromr her   SAINT CECILIA.        109 father, stating that his house was so crowded with guests that she would have to spend Christmas with her aunt." "Impossible I Not receive his own daughter I It is but two days since Sir Watkins, in writing to me, said he ex- pected you with her. I do not understand this. But I am sorry for your disappointment, Constance." "I am sorry, too," said Constance. "But perhaps, Mrs. Latimer, you mistake the cause of my sorrow." Mrs. Latimer looked inquiringly at her. And she went on to say: "Miss Meredith has been five years under your care?" "Five weary years," said Mrs. Latimer. "And you have taken even more than your usual pains in her education?" "More than usual pains," answered Mrs. Latimer, winc- ing under this questionin,. ' I am afraid, Mrs. Latimer, you have not been as suc- cessful as you imagine-he re!" And Constance touched the region of her heart with emphatic action. Mrs. Latimer's conscience smote her. She felt that the training of the heart had been with her the matter last and least considered; and an artless young girl had detected the omission. She made no reply; and was glad when Constance turned away to say farewell to some other scholars about to leave them. Mrs. Latimer had indeed changed Miss Meredith, but not reformed her; her strong rule and worldly counsels had transformed a wilful, passionate child into a selfish, deceitful, malignant girl, now blooming into womanhood. Under Mrs. Latimer's influence, she had been conpliant toward Constance while she could make use of her. While indulging her own vanity by boasting of the splendor of Llangynnoc House and the style of living there,-and longing to exhibit them to her companion,-she used the 10  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7202-00000056"/> "O       SA'INTT CECILIA. prospect of enjoying a visit there as the means of influenc- ing Constance. But she had been sorely offended at the refusal to take her likeness; she at once resolved that Con- stance should never cross the threshold of Llangynnoc House; and to give keener edge to the disappointment she had induced her to make elaborate and costly prepara- tion for the intended visit.  But when she saw Constance arrayed in the tasteful costume which set off her beauty and grace so highly, an envious pang shot through her heart, accompanied, but not mitigated, by a malignant joy, which, for a moment, she could not conceal. In the gay and fashionable circle as- sembling at Llangynnoc House-in the midst of which she hoped to shine-this "lbright, particular star" would not appear to eclipse her. Now, as she posted on, she thought of those she most wished to meet. Young Conway, just from Oxford, and Charley Lawless, that brilliant young Guardsman, and Owen Penrice, of Baldoc Hall, and other available beaux. "I would be a fool, indeed, to bring that girl with me, with her French airs and foreign graces, her siren voice and artful simplicity. Papa himself, who is always finding fault with me, would have been the first to draw odious comparisons. No! Let her put on her fine dresses and queen it about the musty old school-rooms at Latimer Lodge!"And she burst into a triumphant laugh, which startled both coachman and footman by its fiendish tones. From this time Mrs. Latimer treated Constance with even more consideration than she had done, but with less real cordiality. She began to dread the acuteness of ob- servation which detects artifice, and the directness that exposes it. For, even without any unusual acuteness, the directness of youth is often the best touchstone for detect- ing the pretensions of the insincere.   SAINT CECILIA.         1" CHAPTER    IX.

CONSTANCE had now no resource but to remain at the Lodge during the holidays. Mrs. Latimer promised to make her comfortable there, and expressed the hope that she would not find it very dull; she herself would be ab- sent for a time, but one of the teachers would remain, and have under her charge a little girl whose parents were in India. The next day Constance observed that Mrs. Latimer was very busy preparing for the reception of her son, com- ing home from school during the holidays. One of the best chambers was got ready for him, and furnished with every convenience; it was more than once inspected by this careful mother, who gave; other indications that she was looking for the arrival of an important personage. As the evening drew on she became restless, went often to the window and gazed down the road, watching each vehicle that came in sight. The daughter, a girl of eleven, partook of her mother's excitement, and the housekeeper and servants were not unmoved. But it was long after dark when a chaise drove up to the door, and a youngster of fifteen sprang out of it. He was a bright, good-looking boy, and was received with delight by his sister, whose joy he seemed to share fully.

There was something hard and unbending in her manner toward him; and he in turn was more respectful than fond. He appeared on his guard in her presence, and cautious in his answers to her questions; but toward his sister the joyous frankness of the boy broke out; to her he demeaned himself with the affectionate yet patronizing air of brotherhood and seniority. lie showed, too, strong in- dications of a wish to establish himself on a sociable foot- ing with Constance; yet an occasional air of preoccupa- tion and constraint lingered about him. The next morning, when they had finished breakfast, Mrs. Latimer, as she rose from the table, cast a glance of peculiar meaning at her son, and left the room. He fol- lowed her as if bound on some high and doubtful enter- prise, and Constance saw nothing of mother or son for some hours. But they reappeared at lunch,-the mother easy, cheerful, indeed, radiant with smiles; while the son, in the highest spirits, talked, laughed, and eat, played the agreeable to Constance, and was more patronizing to his sister than ever. To these two he presently proposed a walk to the village. They joined him readily, and Constance was much pleased with her new companion, a bold, manly boy, full of life, and of school fun and anecdote, betraying much love of mischief, but no meanness. They were soon in the village, where Constance made some trifling purchases.  But Charley Latimer's money seemed to burn his pockets, from his anxiety to get rid of it. He bought several presents for his sister, and would have been equally generous to Constance, had she permitted it. He also made a forag- ing incursion into the confectionery province of the village grocer, and seemed to think sugar-plums little more costly   SAINT CECILIA.        113 than pebbles, giving each little boy or girl he met a handful of them. He seemed to know every man, woman, and child in the village, treating them with the patronizing air of the lord of the manor, while all seemed to recognize hini as the Latimer of Latimer Lodge, a name familiar to the country around for generations. Struck with the contrast between the boy of yesterday and to-day, Constance, on the walk home, seized the occa- sion of a momentary pause in his somiewhat boisterous chat to ask an explanation of the change she observed in him. Young Latimer laughed heartily at the question. "Last night I was a culprit awaiting my trial. Now the assizes are over, and I am acquitted. Ay; I have come off with ,colors flying.

"I have often heard that learning is better than house and land," said Constance, laughing; " but I never knew its money value accurately measured until now." "All learning is reduced to pounds, shillings, and pence," said young Latimer. "Such simple things as arithmetic and geography bring in but six pence a week. Geometry and French pay better. But Latin and Greek pay best. Cicero, who was a barrister, and accustomed to large fees from his clients, fees me with a liberal hand. But IIomer!" he exclaimed, drawing two sovereigns from his pocket and tossing them into the air, "glorious old Homer!"Then catching them as they fell, he added, "That chap is a gold mine to me!"  At this most un-Homeric apostrophe to the prince of poets Constance laughed heartily, while he added, "Next term I shall pocket a nice little sum every week." lie then plunged into a detail of his financial resources, mingled with many remarks, by which, without intending it, he threw light on many traits in his mother's character which had puzzled Constance greatly until this time. Able and ambitious as Mrs. Latimer was, her energies were now devoted to one object. Iler son was the head of an old family, and she was bent on his taking the place which the Latimers had held in the county in former days. But the misfortunes and improvidence of more than one generation had brought down the house, and it needed the labors and merits of more than one generation to rebuild it. She shrank from no toil or sacrifice to lay the founda- ,tion solidly. But her son must qualify himself for eminent siccess in some professional career, to enable him to coim- plete the work she had' so well begun. Already had she lifted more than one heavy mortgage on the fiagments of   SAINT CECILIA.        115 the ancestral estate to which she had clung. She had pumped much water out of the sinking ship, and it began to float at ease. But much remained to be done, and she only worked the harder while preparing her son to take his turn. Busy as Mrs. Latimer was, she studiously cultivated her personal friendships, and strove to keep up her social influence and position. This, in fact, was an important part of her business. She had leisure for it only during the holidays, at which time she was a welcome guest at many houses in this and the adjacent counties. It was her custom at these times to pay a round of visits, taking both son and daughter with her, and giving them oppor- tunity and instructions to make the most of the hpreditary friendships of their house. In a day or two she set out on her diplomatic tour, leaving under the charge of her house. keeper the Lodge and a very small garrison, consisting of Constance, an assistant teacher who had no home, and the little girl whose parents were in India. The comparative solitude- and absolute quiet which reigned in Latimer Lodge, in strong contrast with the late throng and bustle under the excitement of the joyous dc- parture, weighed heavily on the hearts of the few left behind. The desolate air of the empty rooms and silent playground impressed Constance with a meditative melan- choly; and as Mrs. Latimer's carriage vanished in the distance, she stood looking out upon the shrubbery, now robbed of its glories by the wintry blast, while she pas- sively watched the train of gloomy thoughts which rose up and glided on before her. Perhaps she was unwilling to rouse herself from a mood in which the mind, no longer moving in the track marked out by another, revelled in its freedom to follow its own impulses; and pleasing and poetic images soon began to mingle with the dark shades of the  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7202-00000059"/> "6        SAIN T CECILIA. picture. But however able to live within herself, Con- stance was not one who lived only for herself. A sigh caught her ear, and looking round she saw Miss Parker, the teacher, sitting listlessly by the fire. Constance was struck with the prostration of spirit indicated by her whole air and attitude. Jaded with unceasing' tasks of dull routine, hopeless and purposeless, old in youth, she seemed to seek only rest, rest. At this moment the little girl came into the room. She had been wandering about the empty passages, sad, bewildered, and in tears. Going to her, Constance took her by the hand, saying, At least we will have no lessons to-day, Maggie, nor to- morrow, either." Then leading her to the moping figure by the fire, she said, "The old Lodge is a dull place now, Miss Parker, but there is a gay world outside of it. Let us run away for an hour or two,-I have to go into the village, and do not like walking there by myself. You must take care of me. So let us get our hats and cloaks and be off at once. We will see some people and find some amuse- ment by the way." Miss Parker needed an impulse from without. Partly froin the habit of obeying the impulses received from another, partly from the conviction that it was her duty to look after the big and little girl left behind at the Lodge, she rose listlessly, but was presently ready to join her young companions. When the little girl was out of doors and in motion she soon recovered her spirits. Constance exerted herself to rouse and entertain her more despondent companion. This was no easy task. But Constance was young, hopeful, and imagrinative, and gradually succeeded in communi- cating to her some portion of her own vivacity. Miss Parker roused herself from her melancholy, and looked out upon the world around her. l   SAINT CECIL IA.        117 With these two for her only,companions, Constance labored to turn their solitary life at Latimer Lodge ii)to a holiday, and was not altogether unsuccessful. The little girl was inseparable from her, and with rest from monot- onous labor, exercise out of doors, and a lively companion, Aliss Parker recovered strength and a better tone of mind. As scholar or teacher she had been at the Lodge ever since Mrs. Latimer first opened her school, and was conversant with its annals from the foundation. She was at first afraid and reluctant to speak freely to Constance of Mrs. Latimer, whose energetic and domineering character had completely cowed her. But in contact now-with a freer and bolder spirit, she was gradually emboldened, and, from time to time, gave Constance such full details as to Mrs. Latimer's politic and selfish modes of dealing with all who came within the sphere of her influence, and so completely unveiled her hard, grasping, and manoeuvring character, that Constance felt unwilling to remain longer under her charge, and found it difficult, on Mrs. Lati- mer's return, to conceal the change which her feelings and opinions had undergone.  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7202-00000060"/> "        S4INT CECILIA.

A NEW term began, many new scholars crowded in to fill the vacant places, and a similar round of studies and occupations were entercd upon, with this difference to Constance, that she now saw plainly the profitable use Mrs. Latimer made of the pupil she was paid for teach- ing. But it is unnecessary to detail further the incidents of the boarding-school. From her first arrival at Latimer Lodge, Constance had kept up a brisk Ccorrespondence with both her parents; yet there had been an avoidance of unpleasant topics on both sides. Constance, knowing that her stay at the Lodge would not be much prolonged, thought it needless to disturb them by revealing her changed opinion of Mrs. Latimer, who was undoubtedly an able woman, at whose school much could be learned.  Of late more than one of her father's letters indicated some anxiety as to her mother's health. Mrs. Guilford never mentioned the subject; but Constance fancied that she wrote less cheerfully than formerly. She dwelt much on the benefits Constance was deriving from Mrs. Lati- mer's school, particularly by making not a few friends among her companions there, and expressed no wish to see her in Mallta; yet she seemed anxious to impress upon her daughter that her father missed her greatly, and she said emphatically that much of the comfort of his future life must be derived from the society and attentions   SAINT CECILIA.        119 of that daughter. These expressions struck Constance as implying a failure of her father's health and energy, which rendered him more dependent on those around him. His health she knew had been shattered by his campaigns in India, and must have failed again in Malta. She looked forward cagerly to the end of the term, when she was to join them there. But some weeks before that time she received letters at once from both her parents. H-Ier mother informed her that she had been ill, as the handwriting bore witness, and that she recovered her strength but slowly. Her father's letter contained a draft for money, and directed her to request Mrs. Latimer to find at once some fit person to accompany her to Portsmouth, where she could soon put herself under the care of an officer's wife who was sailing for Valetta. Constance was alarmed and shocked. Her mother ill  She had never known her so before, and she thought that she detected in her father's letter more anxiety than he expressed. She hastened to Mrs. Latimer, laid the letter before her, and abruptly urged that she should be sent off at once. Mrs. Latimer read the letter carefully, and uttered a well-turned expression of sorrow at Mrs. Guil- ford's illness, and the loss she herself would suffer in losing Constance. There was no affectation in this last regret. After a moment's pause, she said, "Pray calm youself, my dear; I will inquire as to the means of getting you safely to Portsmouth, and thence to Malta; but a young lady cannot be sent off by express like a parcel off goods. You must not let your inexperience exaggerate the emer- gency. People will be ill at times. In a day or two I will be able--" "A day or two!", Constance exclaimed. "The delay of a day or two may detain me at Portsmouth for weeks!"  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7202-00000061"/> 120        SAINT CECILfIA. "But a young lady cannot go to Portsmouth alone. I must find the means of sending you there safely." Constance looked steadily at Mrs. Latimer. "' She does not know that mother I She does not feel the urgency of the case." And snatching up the letter she hurried out of the room. She went at once to the housekeeper.' During the holi- days she had often seen with her and spoken to a respect- able woman named Stillwell, who had been an upper servant, in the confidence of several genteel families, and was accustomed to travel all over England. She was no longer young, and not in service at this time. Constance sent for her in haste, explained to her the emergency, and Stillwell at once agreed to accompany her to Ports- mouth, and even to Malta, if it proved necessary. In two hours after her interview with Mrs. Latimer, Constance again entered her room with Stillwell in her train. She merely said, "Mrs. Latimer, this is the person I shall take with me." That lady at once recognized a master- spirit like her own. Stillwell was known to her. She could not deny her fitness for the post. She promptly expedited Constance's journey, took a most affectionate leave of her, and that night Constance was on the road to Portsmouth, with her duenna-like maid-servant seated by her side. At Portsmouth she met with sickening delay. Day after day Stillwell was sent out in vain to inquire for vessels sailing for Malta, having ladies on board, while Constance paced her narrow chamber impatiently waiting her return, and chafing as if imprisoned in a cage. On the fifthay Stillwell brought better news. She had found a lady, the wife of Captain Gordon of the -th, stationed at Malta, and Mrs. Gordon had taken passage in the ship to sail the next day. In reply to Stillwell's inquiries,   SAINT CECILIA,        121 whether she would take a young lady under her care for the voyager, Mrs. Gordon answered, "A dozen, if you have them. Bring her here, and let me see if she will pass mlUSter." "She, seems to be a frank, merry lady, miss," said Still- well, "and will doubtless take good care of you; but I do not think she is high bred, and I am a good judge, miss. One who has lived as an upper servant in half a dozen real gentlemen 's houses is not easy to deceive in that." Without giving Stillwell time to rest, Constance hast- ened Nwith her to the inn at which Mrs. Gordon was. On being shown up-st-airs to a parlor, as she reached the head of the staircase, Constance heard a loud but not harsh voice exclaim, "You Arthur Wellesley, what are you doing there?" A childish but not feoble voice answered, "No- thing, ma'am." Tlhe door was wide open, and she saw a stout lady seated at a table mnaking up several parcels. The re- doubtable Arthur Wellesley was represented by a sturdy boy of seven, standing with his hands in his pocket at the open window, gazing placidly into the street. lBut, as in his namesake, this repose of manner covered the most complete preparation for action. The moment his mother took her eye off of him, lie drew some missile out of his pocket and hurled it down with true aim on the head of some one passing by. When Stillwell stepped forward, and said, "Here is my voung mistress, iiadam," Mrs. Gordon turned and rose from her seat. She seemed to be little over thirty, was of middle height, a decided brunette, with a quantity of raven black hair. She would have been good looking but for her robustness, and a somewhat amazonian air. There was a singular boldness and self-possession in the            ]s1l  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7202-00000062"/> 122       SAINT CECILIA. glance she turned" upon Constance, who now advanced and stated the urgent occasion that hurried her to Malta, and her anxiety to put herself under the protection of some officer's wife who was going thither. Impressed by her earnest, yet graceful manner, Mrs. Gordon said, "Well, my dear, you have found one. And as to the urgency of the cause which hurries you thither, there is never occasion to anticipate evil; I always hope for the best, and never say die. When Captain Gordon was missing after that unlucky affair with the Birmans on the Irrawaddy, all his comrades gave him up for lost; but I always said he would turn up. And so he did, not much the worse for all he had gone through." Meanwhile Arthur Wellesley, having exhausted his mis- siles, or seeking a new field of action, left the window and reconnoitred the newcomers. After walking round them, he took a stand in front of Constance, and, with his feet far apart and his hands in his pockets, stood steadily gaz. ing up)on her. Mrs. Gordon looked down upon her boy, then followed his example, taking a deliberate survey, which confused Constance not a little. A mischievous smile passed over Mrs, Gordon's face. "As usual, I have been talking too fast. I am not sure that I shall do right to carry you to Malta, my dear; you look like a dangerous person. There are a great many foolish young fellows in the garrison; you will corrupt their allegiance, and loosen the bonds of discipline. Why, you will take Valetta by storm." "Indeed I have no such evil designs," said Constance, blushing, yet smiling. "I am a peaceable person, and a loyal subject." Then she added, gravely, " fMy mother is an invalid, and we shall keep much at home." "Then she is very unlike mothers with daughters as presentable as you. But I suppose I must run the risk.   SAINT CECILIA.        123 It is not my business to look to the safety of Malta. Let Sir C-- N-- see to that. What is your age?" "Nearly seventeen." "A most dangerous age!" said Mrs. Gordon, shaking her head. "When we reach Valetta, what a commotion we will make there! But remember, all 'that must go on under your mother's eye. Should we chance to have for fellow-passenger any little lieutenant or ensign, going out to join his regiment, there must be no flirting on shipboard; vou are not to turn the poor fellow's head; I feel bound to take care of these beardless boys. But here have I been lecturing you all this time on the proprieties, and never offered you a seat. Never mind. The ship sails in the morning; you had better shift your quarters to this inn, and put yourself at once under my command." Constance complied with this proposal; and Stillwell's services being needed no farther than Portsmouth, it was settled that she should return to Orton as soon as the ship had sailed. The next day they found themselves at sea, on board a merchantman, bound for Smyrna, touching'at Malta on the way. If Mrs. Gordon was not exactly the chaperon Con- stance would have chosen, she could have found no more efficient protectress, and few more amusing companions. Daughter and wife to a soldier, she had been born in gar- rison, passed her life at military posts, lived only in mili- tary circles, was identified with the army, and had resided, at some period, in each of the four quarters of the world. She had a thorough contempt for civilians, and little love for the naval arm of the service. No woman knew better how to take care of herself and those dependent upon her. She was convinced that the way to get on in the thorough- fare of life is to elbow and shoulder your way through the crowd. She now exerted herself to make her party I  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7202-00000063"/> 124        SAINT CECILIA. comfortable, with no little success,-being an experienced traveller by land and water, and knowing how to make other people give way to her; yet a little gentleness mixed with her energy would have added to her own comfort, and that of other folks. In a day or two she had thoroughly drilled the steward and cabin-boy to obedience, had domineered over three or four quiet commercial agents going out to the Levant, hec- tored the mates foi* suffiring Arthur Wellesley to venture up the shrouds, and there was nobody, but the master, un- subjected to her rule; lhe saw his turn coining, and being a man of strategy seized occasion to ward off the attack. The passengers were all on the quarter-deck one fine morn- ing, when Mrs. Gordon, giving an imperious order to the steward, which he 'seemed to obey slowly, the master turned sternly upon him, exclaiming, "Stir yourself, you lubber! Don't you hear the commodore speaking to you?" Mrs. Gordon turned red, and bit her lip, but said nothing; and the title of commodore was at once adopted by passengers and crew. Half an hour after this, the breeze freshening somewhat, the master said, "It is getting rather squally, Mrs. Gordon. Don't you think we had better take in the top-gallant sails?" At any time tlat she displayed her overmastering spirit, the master was ready for her with, "Mrs. Gordon, the wind has fallen. Shall we shake out a reef?"Or, "Will you look over the log-book, cast up the dead-reckoning, and tell us when we will see Cape Finisterre?"These little demonstrations had a quieting effect on the commodore. With the master she found it best to remain at peace. Neither was she very successful in keeping Arthur Wellesley unrder control. He was prone to mischief, and the mates, in dudgeon against the mother, urged him on to pranks that kept mother and son in a continual skir-   SAINT CECILIA.        125 mish. He had a climbing ambition, and aimed at reching the maintop; she forbade his putting his foot on the shrouds. The boy, seeing the first mate go up to the maintop about mid-day to look around the horizon, asked the second mate what he was doing there. Upon this lie was told that the first mate was a stingy fellow, and having laid in a large stock of apples, nuts, and candy for the voyaerc, he had gone aloft to enjoy these good things where nobody could ask him for a share. "But if you go up quickly, before he has eaten all, he will have to give you some." Looking round, and not seeing his mother on deck, Arthur Wellesley made his way up the shrouds, then through the lubber's hole, and seated himself alongside of the mate; but not an apple, nut, or piece of candy did lie see; and the mate laughed heartily when he found out what had brought the boy up there. But the strange monotony of the wide expanse around hiln fascinated his eye, and he had forgotten the disappointment of his palate while gazing upon it. When Mrs. Gordon, coming on deck, missed her son, and at length espied him in the maintop, her loud voice was soon heard ordering hinl down, and promising him a flogging as sootn as she laid hand on him. He thought this an excellent reason for staying wlhre he was, and loitered there so long that the mate had to bring him d(own by force. The moment he touched the deck the mate let go lis hold, and the boy took refuge in the forecastle among the watch below; but lunchtiime came on and he soon came prowling aft., Mrs. Gordon was at table, cutting . cake wiith a long ar'ving knife.

The mother dragged off the son to administer the flogging she owed him, to the great enjoy- ment of the quiet commercial men, who had suffered much from the tyranny of the one and the pranks of the other. Mrs. Gordon was not much given to books.- Hcr read- ing was limited to the "United Service Journal'" and such periodicals. But she had an extensive acquaintance within the pale of the service, a good memory, and a keen sense of the ridiculous. She was rich in anecdotes and traits of persons connected with the army. The phases of life she had seen were new to Constance, lwho lent an attentive ear, and gathered from her lboth alnusement and instruction. Mrs. Gordon loved scandal, and would at timets commence some narrative of an objectionable character. But before she got far in it, on looking into that innocent young face, and finding those clear, blue, penetrating eyes fixed won- deringly on her, she would check herself. "But I forgot. This story is not exactly one I slould tell you, or you would listen to. Ten years hence perhaps," she would mutter to herself. "But no; ten years will bring more knowledge of evil, but. hardly less aversion to it, or the recital of its details. We see much and hear more," she added aloud, with a sigh, " which had better be unseen and unheard."  Hackneyed as Mrs. Gordon was, in the ways of a society   SAIN ' CECILIA.        127 lax in its tone, and not rigid in its morals, her manne always became softer and more refined as she turned to Constance. She felt that her intercourse with a pure and , high-minded girl,- not only innocent but ignorant of evil tended to purify and elevate her own thoughts. As the voyage drew near its end, Constance's anxiety as to her nlother increased. At length the rugged coast of Malta rose slowly above the waters. A fair 1and steady breeze wafted them in a few hours into the harbor of Va'letta. The ship had barely come to anchor when parties boarded her tfrom different boats. Among thenl ConstanIce saw an officer Springl over the bulwarks, whom Mrs. Gor- don hailed in loud and joyous tones. .he threw herself into his armls, while Arthur Wellesley, raising a shout, seized him by the left leg. Luckily he was a sturdy fel- low, or he would have succumbed under this combined attack. Eager questions were asked and answered; and presently Constance, who had drawn back some steps, distinguished her own name. The voices of this loving couple sunk lower, and their faces became grave. Mr. Gordon glanced round with a troubled countenance, and presently drawing near to Constance said, "Let me spelak to you for a moment." As Mrs. Gordon led her back from the throng, Constance felt this lady's hand' tremble, and saw her face turn pale. "What is the matter?"Constance asked. But Mrs. Gordon seenedt much agitated atnd unable to speak. She merely turned and gazed toward the group thev had left. It opened, and a fided apparition of Colonel Guilord, rather than hinmself, stepped forward. Being on duty he was in uniform, but a band of black crape encircled his arm1. Constance speechlessly pointed to it. He clasped her in his arms, but only found breath to utter two. words, "Too late 1"  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7202-00000065"/> 128        SAINT CECILIA.

BIRON'S CONsPIRACY. THE long and dreary months of the Maltese summer had  passed away since Constance's sad meeting with the only parent left her. It had been a painful period to her. But deep as was her grief for the loss she had suffered, she had  soon found a duty which made her struggle against it. Her father, broken in health, and more broken in spirit,  needed all the consolation her companionship could afford. Ambitious soldier as Colonel Guilford had been, he had always sought his happiness in domestic life; and when Constance looked at his now frail form, shattered by. wounds, hardships, and the climate of India, she at length rightly construed her mother's later letters, as indicating her anxiety for the welfare of him she was about to leave behind her. Colonel Guilford's duties in the garrison of Valetta were mere routine, still punctually, but now almost mechanically performed. They occupied but little of his time, and he had lost interest in other occupations. Shunning all society but that of his daughter, and even with her sitting silent and sorrowful, brooding over his loss, his gloomy inertness alarmed her. She felt that he must be roused from it; and, controlling her own feelings, Constance led him to talk of her mother, while she listened in tears; yet gradu- ally weaned hinl from (dwelling on the closing scelne by   SAINT CECILIA.        129 leading him to revert to earlier periods of his wedded life. She also resumed such of her habitual occupations as were likely to interest him; and, under the plea of suf- fering from confinement, induced him to take her out on occasional strolls to the most retired spots they could find, the intense heat of the climate and their wish for privacy leading them to take their exercise chiefly after nightfall. Young, enthusiastic, and imaginative, Constance began to take an interest in the scenes around her, and her reviv- ing ardor in the pursuits which occupied her did not fail to awaken in her father a new interest in life. He gradu. ally threw off much of his gloom, and looked to her tastes and occupations as sources of interest to himself. In so large a garrison the families of married officers formed no small circle of society. Constance necessarily made many acquaintances among the ladies there. But all attempts to draw her out to scenes of gayety failed. She had not forgotten her mother, and was too nmuch occupied with her father. Mrs. Gordon especially pro- nounced her to be incorrigible, and so unfit for this busy, merry world, that the right place for her was a nunnery. Yet Constance unavoidably became known and admnired. Several young officers, seeing her at the chapel, became more punctual in their attendance there, and selected scats from which they had a good view of her black crape bonnet, and could catch an occasional glimpse of her face. Mny visits were paid Colonel Guilford, with the hope of finding him not alone; and Constance was the mlore sociable from a conviction that her father led too recluse a life. In his anxiety to make a provision for his daughter, Colonel Guilford had become an economist of late years. He now kept few servants, lived in an unpretending style, and occupied a house in a retired part of Valetta. To this house was attached a garden, in which was a walk shaded  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7202-00000066"/> 130       SAIN1T CUCUILIA.  from the scorching sun of Malta by a thick row of orange- trees. This being Constance's favorite promenade, be- came her father's also.  One morning she had taken her seat, book in hand, by i the parlor window which looked into the garden. While  reading here, voices from the orange-walk attracted her  attention, and she perceived that her father had a corn- panion with him there. This was nothing strange; many officers had occasion to call on him. But she could hear the voices distinctly, and it struck her thnt her father was not only the chief speaker, but that there was an animation and emphasis in the tones of his voice which reminded her of days long gone by. She could catch but an occa- sional glimpse of the figures, through the dense foliage, as they passed to and fro along the walk. Her father was between her and his companion, and she remarked, with much surprise, that his countenance was animated, his bearing more youthful, and his tone and. action indicated an energy he had not displayed of late. What could be the subject of discourse? Who could this companion be who had revived in her father much of the energy of his youth? For some time they limited their promenade to the shaded walk, but at length came out into the open ground. Constance was now struck with the figure and bearing of her father's companion, who was utterly unknown to her, and she eyed him with great curiosity. He was a young man, of not more than two or three and twenty, of good height and a graceful figure, which indicated great activity and no little strength. He was not in uniform, but fromn his bearing he was probably a soldier. Yet there was nothing- professional in his air. He was now the chief speaker, and was fluent and emphatic in speech, and singu- larly earnest in manner, occasionally using some graceful   ,I     1wJ1^ .'. UlA.       131 yet energetic gesture, which the orator oftener aims at than attains. His countenance was striking, and many would call it handsome. When not looking ait his companion his deep-set eyes seemed to be gazitig at objects far remote. As he raised his hat firom his head, in taking leave of Colonel Guilford, his light-brown silken hair and his fair, broad forehead were strongly contrasted with the eyes, which seemed so daik under the well-marked, overhanging brows, and with the lower part of the face, tanned by exposure to the sun. Colonel Guilford accompanied him to the garden gate, and prolonged their conference some minutes before he let him go. When her father entered the room in wlich Constance was sitting, he seemed still absorbed by thoughts sug.- gested by his recent conference, and still impelled by an alertness communicated by his late companion. He took a turn up and down the room, with an elastic step, then pausing, said aloud, but less to Constance than to himself, Y es, India is the only land ii which an English soldier can nlow find an active field. Yet rumor says that Or. meond lately found one nearer home " "That was Capltain Ormonad, then!" said Constance. "I heard that he had just joined his regiment after a long furlough. Wthere has he been?', "No man knows where,' Colonel Guilford answered. "Sonime people pretend to credit Madame Rumor. But his friends give her the lie, lest she mnliht bring him into trouble at the Horse Guards. But Ormond has high con- nections and strongo friends, and can take liberties not ventured on by other men." "He does not look like the man to do what he would be afraid or ashamed to avow," said Constance. "No, indeed '! said Colonel Guilford. "Yet he had better keep this secret, if rumor speak true."  Then, after ^L^S:-"-^^^^  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7202-00000067"/>  a pause, he added, " Ormond is a restless spirit. We will not have him with us long. Indeed, they say that he never has stayed very long with his regiment. Young as he is,  he has had interest or the knack to obtain several long fur- loughs, and been often absent for months. They do him the justice to say that he appears to make good use of his holiday. On his return, each time, it is found that he has explored a new country, picked up another language, and seen everything with a professional eye.  Those who know him best think him a man of high promise. But he will not be here long,. te cannot endure this sleepy gar- rison life. He is bent on going to India, and will seek to exchange into some regiment already there." " le must be a new acquaintance of yours, papa ?" "We first met two days ago. But he is a man of mark, and the officers of the -th talked much of him, especially since this runor about him got abroad. So that I knew hilm well at second hand. As I lately spent four active years in India, he has just been questioning nme about the country and the service there." " That, then, was the subject," said Constance, " of your long and animated conference under the orange-trees ?" "Yes, and his power of questioning is prodigious. He has just been sucking me like an orange, and left little but the rind." Oh, papa," said Cohstance, "I do not doubt that there is juice enough left in the orange to repay Captain Or- mond for another squeezing." "Perhaps so," said Colonel Guilford, smiling. "And Ormond is himself an orange worth' squeezing."  He took a turn or two across the room, then continued, We all of us have heard of, and sonme of us have known, men who had especial missions in life, whether it be to conquer, convert, or instruct mankind, or divert or swindle   SAINT CECILIA.                133 133 them; for I conceive that Glriraldi and Cagliostro had as m1anifest a mission as Mohamnled himself. Now, Ormond is a man seeking. a mission and very restless and Odangel ous will ie be until he inds it. I believe that the indica- tions of a long peace, which now pervade Europe, make him think that he was born thirty years too late; and, could he hrave written his name in the annals of the British army, e would be well content to have died at Waterloo." "Does he think the world was made only to fight in ?" exclaimed Constance. " It is a pity this young ma--he seems quite young--should so misconceive God's pur- poses. Although you are a soldier yourself, papa, you should try to set him right on this point." "Perhaps you could discuss that- point better than I[ could," said her father, with a smile. "But you would find Ormond a dangerous Opponent in argument, for lie is not ignorant of the arts of peace. But he has chosen war for his profession ; and the high powers pent up in him all impel him to action. It will be well' if lie find it in a legitimate sphere. I conceive that, for a soldier, such can only be found in the service of one's own country. But I doubt Ormond's holding so narrow a creed. If the war will not come to him, he will go to the war, So le had better go at once to India. They are likely soon to have stirring times there, and by going thither he will avoid escapades like his last." Although  Constance asked, her father would not tell what ,this escapade was. But it was soon whispered to her from other quarters, always as a rumor, which, how. ever, everybody believed. The army is, doubtless, an idling profession in time of peace; and in the absence of active service, nothing is  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7202-00000068"/> more improving to the soldier of high aims than wide travels, with a view to the study of the topography of othe scenes of past campaigns, of the military resources of foreign countries, of the character and language of the people, and of the condition of the military art among them. So thought Ormond, and, sick of the dull routine of garrison duty, he obtained leave of absence and dis-  appeared.  Just at this time the Basque provinces in the north of  Spain, exasperated at the inroads on their constitutional rights and chartered privileges by the revolutionary and tyrannical government, had risen in the defence of them,  and that part of Spain was the scene of a bloody civil  i war. Great Britain -and Spain being at peace, the British  government found it convenient to look upon the. Basques as rebels; a rule it has not always observed, preferring to consult its own interest in each particular case. Thus no  objection was made when not a few Englishmen, some of- them bearing the king's commission, moved by love of adventure, took service with the King of Spain, and were active in the campaign against the Basques.  Ormond was not a mere soldier. Before he could champion a quarrel he must be the advocate of a cause. No man held in more utter contempt all those theories of human rights, which, pushed to their necessary ultimate results, lately devastated Europe, and still convulse the world. No one held more sacred those vested rights acquired by individuals, and those political safeguards graduallyadopted by nations, on which only, in his con- viction, civilization could be established and individual rights could be maintained. The efforts of the Basques to defend the political privileges and the personal rights won  by their forefathers long before the Spanish monarchy ex- isted, and preserved long after it was organized, seemed   to Ormond a very pretty quarrel, which a gentleman might take part in without soiling his hands. And he expressed this conviction not in words but in deeds. Suddenly there appeared at the headquarters of that noted Basque leader, Zumalacarregui, one John Hawk- wood, who, backed by some serelt influence, was at once taken into his confidence. In the campaign whlic followed, Hawkwood was gratified with oppotunities of service and and felt. No native leader was more successful than' he was. ve e royal arny att temed to hold this wild mount- asin Legion ly Occupying a number of small posts, and byic up patroling the countr    intrstye w it co l  smallnd ois maud, at the head of which  he soon made himself  n own patrolins~ the country  with many small columns, and this gave occasion to a war of posts and frequent skirmishes, in which Hawkwood found an excellent school for the study of la petite guerre. Many a royalist party omarched blindfold into the fatal trap he had set for them, and several intrenchled and barricaded little stlongholds fell suddenly into his hands. He occasionally met with sonme of his own countrymen in the hostile detachments and ji lhe free distribution of istol-shots and sword- trusts, made with his own hand, some of his compatriots may have come in for their share; for he excelled in sud- dcn, unexpected onslaughts, and, with his new levies saw te necessity of being foremost in the friay.  It is certain that the curiosity of these Anglo-Spaniards was highly and unpleasantly excited as to wriho he really was; for "John Hawkwood," was unmistakably a  nom de guerre, not chosen perhaps int the best taste, for the original was but a condottiero and a freebooter, while  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7202-00000069"/> 136        SAIrN CEOILIA. Hawkwood redivivus had plenty of money, and scattered it with a liberal hand. In many a skirmish and reconnoissance his person be- came known to Englishmen among the royal troops. The horse he rode had not been bred in Spain, but would have made a good figure in an English hunting-field. On his intrusive visits within the royalist lines, he often owed his safety to his cool adroitness, his horse's speed, or some marvellous leap, which defied pursuit; and they learned to recognize his appearance as the forerunner of some dis- aster to themselves. But only one Englishman discovered who Hawkwood really was, and this under circumstances which bound him to secrecy by the strongest pledge. The merciless military executions, by which the Spanish government sought to crush the insurgent Basques, led to fierce retaliation; few prisoners were made, and some, after being taken, were killed in cold blood. On the surprise and defeat of a de- tachment of royalists, an English volunteer, who was with them, fell, wounded, into the hands of the Basques. He was about to be dispatched, when Hawkwood, coming up at the moment, saved him with difficulty, partly by a leader's authority, partly by the strong hand. To this man, who remained under his protection until he could be sent away in safety, his real name and position became known, but were faithfully concealed. At length Zumalacarregui having fallen'at the siege of Bilboa, and Hawkwood being disabled for a time by wounds, and the cause in which he fought evidently lost, he had himself conveyed to an obscure inlet. There he engaged some enterprising fishermen, who, avoiding the English cruisers which blockaded the coast, put him on board a French vessel bound for Bayonne. When Ormond joined his regiment at Malta, he was   SA INT CECILIA.       137 fresh from a tour in Italy, and talked of nothing but what he had seen there. He appeared to have seen everything worth seeing; but then he had been in Italy before. His comrades remarked that froml beneath the rich brown hair that overhung h hi high forehead there peeped out the tail of a very neat scar, apparently a newly-healed wound. When questioned about it, he answered, "It is the mark of a sabre-cut, repaid by an effectual thrust, and that is all vou need know about it." As Ormond was not a man to be obtrusively questioned, nothing more was asked. In the present condition of his health and spirits, Col- onel Guilford cared little for society. But Ormond's earnestness, high purposes, and broad views-the very extravagance of some of his opinions-interested and aroused the older soldier; they reminded him of the aspira- tions of his own youth. In conversing with him, whether agreeing with him or differing froum him,-and they often differed,-he found himself diverted from his habitual train of despondent thought, and occupied with subjects which lead a man beyond, and raise him above, the narrow and selfish sphere of personal feelings and interests. This led him to put himself in Ormond's way; and, not many days after the promenade and conference under the orange-trees, while Constance was expecting her father at tea-time, Or- mond walked in with him. Although Colonel Guilford and his daughter led as se- cluded lives as his position allowed, and his residence was in ,a remote part of Valetta, it occasionally happened of late that two or three young officers would find their way there of an evening; one would be put on duty to enter- tain the colonel, while the others would endeavor to draw out the daughter,-no difficult task up to a certain point. Constance wa, not unsociable, and wished to divert her father from brooding over his sorrows. - She had thus be. 12*  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7202-00000070"/> 138       SAINT CECILIA. come sufficiently well known to cause many regrets that her mourning and her recluse habits rendered her so un- available to the gay society of Valetta. Constance had heard more than one of these gentlemen speak of Ormond; the received version of his adventures in the Basque provinces had been lately whispered to her as a capital joke, so long as this breach of neutrality could not be. proved against him. But Constance could not see it in that light; she was shocked that an officer, holding the king's commission, should employ his furlough in waging war against the king's friends for his own amusement, or to get a lesson in the art of war. She was surprised that her father did not view it in a more serious light; but probably he did not believe the rumor, as Ormond's more prudent friends maintained that the whole story originated in his personal resemblance to an adventurer who had assumed the name of a noted soldier of fortune, dead centuries ago. Constance's curiosity was excited as to Ormond, and the stories told of him, and she now gladly seized the occasion to observe him closely, and to hear him talk. On his being presented to her, she received his addresses with an air of abstraction, for her eyes at once sought out and found that mysterious scar, which, peeping out red and fresh from under the silky hair, betrayed an untold tale of blood. had it been shed and fatally atoned for in some private quarrel, or in wild adventure among the in- surgent Basques? Her keen scrutiny did not make Ormond sociable, and Colonel Guilford became the chief talker. He had been speaking of India when they came in. The four years he had spent there had been the most active and successful part of his life; cut off from his wife and child, he had there bent all his energies, and devoted every hour to   SAINT CECILIA.        139 achieve success. There his services had won him promo- tion and reputation; there, too, he had taken the first step toward re-establishing his ruined fortunes. In that country he had left the accumulated savings from pay and prize- money, now rapidly growing into a competent provision for his only child. Ormond was a more quiescent listener than usual,-the subject interested him. He thought Colonel Guilford an orange still worth squeezing, and, except when asking some pointed question, spoke but little. Yet his thoughts sometimes wandered from the colonel's discourse. He had a fine picture before him in the girl seated by her father's side. He could now criticise it at his leisure, and compare it with the common verdict,-for he, too, had heard much of Miss Guilford from his brother officers,-but found her very different from what he had looked for. Expect- ing to find a young woman accustomed to admiration, and demanding assiduous attention for her entertainment, he found a tall, grave girl, shrouded not only in deep mourning but in no little reserve. With a fine cast of features, her countenance was pallid from confinement and the depressing circumstances of her life for many months past; grave and silent as he now saw her, he would have thought her wanting in animation but for those marvellous eyes, now dwelling with anxious affection on her father, now turned with shy curiosity on him. When Colonel Guilford's remarks on India came to an end, and other topics were broached, Ormond took a larger share in the conversation; but he perceived that while Constance listened attentively, she spoke but little; and, whether from pride, reserve, or coldness, showed no desire to appropriate any part of his visit to herself. The truth was, that what Constance had heard of Ormond tended to make her more observant of, than sociable with him.  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7202-00000071"/> To Ormond she exhibited a singular combination of the woman and the girl. He had known many young ladies 3f her age fully habituated to society, and even a little hackneyed in the pursuits of fashionable life,--a life evi- dently unknown to Constance. Yet her occasional remarks indicated a grasp of mind which few of them could pre- tend to. Stimulated by an enthusiastic temper and early association with older and cultivated companions, her mind had ripened rapidly, while her manners were yet unformed, and her physical development progressed slowly toward the point it was destined to attain. It was only an occasional flash of vivid feeling or of vigorous thought that led Ormond to suspect that an earnest and impas- sioned nature was hidden under that shy and cold exterior. He wondered that his gay and frivolous comrades had been so much fascinated by her. At length the tea-tray was brought in, and Constance, took a seat at the table, for she always prepared her father's tea. Her graceful movements while so employed attracted Ormond's eye. She appeared now to greater advantage than during her shy but vigilant observation of him. But when the tea-tray was removed, she drew her chair aside, and resting her elbow on the table and her cheek on the palm of her hand, she assumed the attitude of a listener, -somewhat annoying to a stranger. India was no longer the subject of conversation, and Ormond was now the chief speaker. Constance listened in silence, until in reply to some question Colonel Guilford asked, Ormond gave an account of something he had seen in Florence. Fixing her eyes upon him with a new interest, Constance leaned forward and asked, "Have you been in Italy lately?" "Yes, very lately," Ormond answered, "Have you travelled much there?"   "Not so much lately as three years ago. To use our English phrase, I then did Italy thoroughly, from Venice to Naples. I worked hard at it, and endeavored to leave no sight unseen, no stone unturned. I pride myself on being a laborious traveller.' "Oh, travelling in Italy must be a labor of love i" Con- stance exclaimed. " Did you spend much time in Rome ?" "Several weeks," Ormond answered. "And they were weeks of hard work. Yet I must have overlooked some things worth seeing. In Rome a lounging, idling fellow, who has any taste for antiquities and the arts, may find amusement for a year." "How it would delight me to lounge there 1" said Con- stance. "But, in truth, I cannot associate the idea of Rome with idleness. With so much around us to arouse our curiosity and spur us on to research, how could we be idle?" "Yet the population of Rome," said Ormond, 'both natives and foreigners, are as great idlers as I have met with." "I would not be one," said Constance. "What! idle in the midst of a world of art and antiquities, all within reach ?"  And she plunged into an enumeration of the objects which would excite inl her the greatest interest; showing a familiarity with their names and characters which astonished Ormond. Presently she asked, "Did you ever 'hear the music in the Sistine Chapel on Holy Thursday, so wild, wondous, and sad ? Running through all the changes of harmony, and exciting every variety of feeling compatible with re- ligious emotions," No, he had not heard the music there on that specially solemn occasion, and the avowal seemed to sin hibm much, as a traveller, in Constance's estimation. Yet she plied  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7202-00000072"/> "2       SAINT CECILI4. him with many questions as to what he had seen in Rome and the impressions made on him. She showed an ex- haustive power of drawing out what was in him ; so Ormond exerted himself to prove that he was a traveller not wanting in curiosity, observation, feeling, or taste. He had done himself only justice in calling himself an in- dustrious traveller. He had observed closely, and now described well what he had seen. Many of his remarks indeed were more interesting to the father than the daughter, being the result of the observation of the soldier and the political inquirer. But Constance brought him back to the matters which interested her, asking a great many questions as to art, antiquities, and the picturesque. She found time to introduce many remarks of her -own, and every now and then some opinion uttered byOrmond would be compared with that of Herr Rhtodoman on the same point, and if there was collision between them, Ormond's was sure to go to the wall. She sometimes quoted WAinkelmann, but Herr Rhodoman was evidently the standard authority with her. At length Ormond asked, "Pray who is Herr Rhodo- man?" "T rue," said Constance. "You never knew him. The dear old man!"And she at once entered on what was a favorite topic; not only because it deeply interesttld her own feelings, but because it was one on which her father liked to hear her dwell. Ormond soon had not only a graphic account of Herr Rhodoman, with many of his maxims and sentiments intersersrsed, ut also an insight into the character of his pupil, who could so well value and set forth his merits. The strength of her attachments, her enthusiasm, her artistic impulses, her vivid imagina- tion, stood out before him and took him by surprise. "You must visit Italy, Miss Guilford,"-said Ormond.   SAINT CECILIA.        143 "I have never known any one so well prepared, in tastes and feelings, to profit by what may be found there." "Yes, Constance," said Colonel Guilford, " we will get a furlough some day, and the enthusiastic longing to visit Italy, which Herr Rhodoman's descriptions -have excited in you, shall be gratified."7 Constance's face brightened at the prospect. "Herr' Rhodoman did muchi to prepare me to profit by the visit. I am convinced that, besides being himself a great artist, he fell nothing short of Winkelmann in learning, taste, and judgment in the arts. If I could only have had him at my elbow as guide and cicerone---" Colonel Guilford sighed deeply and sunk into silence. Constance saw at once that he was thinking of another and a dearer one who would be wanting to the party. She reproached herself for having forgotten ler mother for one moment, and the thoughts of that mother brought tears into her eyes. Ormond saw that the thread of animated conversation was broken, and, having sat long, he now rose to take leave. As lie strolled toward hjs quarters he found himself under'the influence of a fit of admiration which he threw into a prospective form, and caught him- self exclailming, "A very striking girl I What a woman this will be!"  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7202-00000073"/> "4        SAINT CECILIA. CHAPTER XII. "The chiefest action for a man of great spirit Is never to be out of action; The soul was never put into the body, Which has so many rare and curious pieces Of mathematical motion, to stand still." THE DEVIL'S LAW CASE. THE prostrating heat of the Maltese summer was over, and the delightful season of winter, if such it can be called, was at hand. Although Colonel Guilford's spirits had im- proved of late, Constance remarked his languor and physical inertness; and in order to rouse him to exertion and induce him to take the exercise so necessary to his health, she now expressed a keen desire to escape occasionally from the crowded vicinity of Valetta, and extend their excur- sions beyond their usual limits. He exerted himself to gratify her wish, and they no longer limited their excur- sions to strolling about the town and the ramparts after sunset. Procuring a safe and easy-gaited steed for Con- stance, who had enjoyed few opportunities of becoming a skilful equestrian, they visited various points in the interior of the island and along the coast within an hour or two's ride of their quarters. Even within this narrow range Constance met with much to interest her, the more so as she perceived that her father derived benefit from this change of his habits, which the companionship of an enter- prising girl forced upon him. Becoming at home on horseback, and skilful and bold in the management of her steed, Constance longed to widen the area of her explorations; so, in place of an   SAINT CECILIA.        145 evening ride, she induced her father to mount one morning with no definite aim but to ramble beyond their usual limits, and seek for objects of interest which they had not yet seen. In truth, Constance, having gotten her father out, was resolved to make a day of it; so she loaded the servant who followed them with a small but well-filled basket, in order that there might be no excuse for return. ing home in time for luncheon. They had gone about three miles from Valetta, when they heard the galloping of a horse, and suddenly Ormond, mounted on an active but panting galloway, dashed out of a cross-road and drew up before them. "Ha, Ormond!"Colonel Guilford exclaimed, "I did not expect to meet you so far from Valetta." He was pleased at this accidental meeting,--for such he tlought it,-and Ormond said nothing to undeceive him; yet half, an hour before he had seen them mount and ride in this direction. While bowing to Constance, he answered her father, "It is not strange you should meet me, sir; I ride much. In Malta we, cannot speak 'of riding far; the island is some- what large and rough for a race-course, but it does not afford room for a journey." "Yet, rugged as it is, you seem to have been racing over it," said Colonel Guilford, looking at the panting horse, as Ormond turned and reined him alongside of Con- stance, as if he meant to ride with them. "If you think of joining us you must slacken your pace. We do not know exactly whither we are going; but if you have leisure, you may join us." "I will follow your lead blindfold, sir," said Ormond, deferentially. "Yet let me ask Miss Guilford what is the object of her ride this morning?" "We have undertaken what is not easily done in Malta," said Constance. "We are seeking to get out of a crowd." 13  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7202-00000074"/> "6        SAINT CECILIA. "No easy task, truly," said Ormond, "in this little island with twelve hundred souls to the square mile. The Mal- tese are continually crowding each other off the land into the water; thousands become seamen of necessity, and excellent seamen they make. But in the most populous land there are still solitary spots, and I can point them out here." "Why, Ormond," said Colonel Guilford, " you have been barely a month in Malta. Do you undertake to be our guide?" Surely a month is long enough," answered Ormond, "to enable one to master the topography of such a spot as this." "Not unless you make it your special business to do so."- "I make it an especial part of my business wherever I go," he answered. "In my travels I always keep our pro- fession in my eye; and topography lies at the foundation of the art of war. Were I a general (I will be, if I live) I would put a thorough knowledge of the region I made war in before even that of the troops I commanded or the enemy I opposed." "I am not sure but that you there utter a sound mili- tary nmaxim," said Colonel Guilford, thoughtfully; and he at once launched into a series of remarks on topography as the basis of strategy and the whole art of war. Ormond, contrary to his wont, did not encourage him to continue the subject, but soon broached other topics more pleasing to a lady's car. lHe soon proved, too, that he was a competent guide, and must have thoroughly explored the island. Populous and bare as it was,-for, out of the gardens, no tree was to be seen,-it afforded little attractive scenery. But it abounds in picturesque little churches; and Ormond led them to two or three of the most striking,   SAINT CECILIA.        1i without taking them much out of the way. One of these especially took Constance's eye. "This is a gem of a chapel!" she exclaimed. And having her sketch-book with her, she added, "If you can spare me a few minutes, papa, I will dismount and make a sketch of it." Ormond sprang from his horse; but she had dismounted before he could come to her aid. Seating herself by the roadside, she was soon at work. He drew near to watch her progress, but received a broad hint which drove him off. "Lest this delay should prove tedious to you, Cap- tain Ormond, you had better go and discuss topography with papa." The drawing was soon finished; and Constance, who seemed shy of Ormond's assistance, climbed to her saddle by aid of a high bank by the roadside. As he rode beside her, he said, "I understand now what is my duty as guide. I am to find picturesque objects for you to sketch, but am not allowed to see the results." "Of course not," said Constance, with a smile. "You might prove an unfriendly critic. Moreover, I never show anything of mine until I have bestowed the utmost labor on it." Well, I will do my duty, although I am not to be paid for it," said Ormond. "Here is the Bengamtma before us. This ridge divides the eastern part of Malta fromn the western; beyond it, although every available acre is culti- vated, there are many barren spots where you can find the solitude you seek."' "Does it afford any picturesque scenes?"Constance asked. "Only on the immediate coast. There you will find lofty cliffs overhanging the sea; on their perpendicular faces there are a nunmber of eaves and grottoes, not a few very large, and some of them on a level with the sea, with  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7202-00000075"/> "8       SAINT CECILIA. the waves rolling into them, while others you can explore dry-shod." "Let us hasten on, then," Constance said. "We owe many thanks, Captain Ormond, to your turn for topog- raphy and your rambling propensities, and will task your capacities as a guide." "I think Constance is disposed to laugh at your devo- tion to topography, Ormond," said Colonel Guilford. "She does not know its value in war." "I am not going to wage war," said Constance. "But far from laughing at it, am trying to make it useful in peace. But I am afraid that Captain Ormond will think his topographical labors degraded by being put to a pacific use." She put her horse into a canter toward the high ground before them, and when they reached the crest of the ridge, Ormond led them aside to a higher point, where they paused to survey the little world of Malta in its length and breadth. It needed all the powers of their fieldl- glasses to magnify its dimensions into something like importance. Continuing their ride, Ormond led them, through a region altogether rural, to the lofty cliffs on the western coast. Here Constance attained her object of finding a solitude in crowded Malta. The land was barren and desolate, the only living things in sight being a few sheep, goats, and asses, and a herdboy in the distance. But the sea was populous, and the view of it magnificent, its mono- tony being broken by the white sails of numberless fishing. boats and other smnall craft which dotted its surface. The island of Gozzo was seen close at hand to the northwest; and with straining eyes they sought to distinguish the dis- tant shores of Sicily, and the head of lofty AJtna; but a haze in that direction defied the powers of eyes and glasses.   SAINT CECILIA.        149 After gazing long at the scene before them, Constance exclaimed, "How imposing must the cliffs be when seen from below!" Ormond at once undertook to lead them down to the beach. Ite knew, he said, a safe path, and indeed seemed to have almost a shepherd's klowledge of the region around themt. Leading them half a mile back from the coast, he entered on a path which led down a ravine. The way looked dangerous for horses, and Colonel Guilford was startled at the risk Constance would run in riding down; but Ormond, who thought difficulties only existed to be overcome, placed himself at her horse's head, putting her on the inside. Utterly without caution for himself, he left his horse to look to his own footing, while lie watched every step taken by that which - Constance rode. There was a calm vigilance in his attendance on her which made her feel safe under his care and pleased with his attention. It excited another feelin(g than her father's care did when she first began to ride with him. There was a pleasant little thrill produced by the mingled sensation of danger and protection; she began to feel more at ease with her escort. At the bottom of the ravine they found themselves be- side a small inlet. Farther on they passed a hamlet of fishermen's huts, and turning a point, they came out on a shingle beach, with the sea before them, the surf breaking lazily on the shore, and the precipitous cliff rising hundreds of feet above their beads,-the calcareous wall being honey- combed by many a dark cavern. It was near mid-day, and they had been suffering from the heat of the sun. But here they were in the shade, anl( dismounting, gave their horses to the care of the groom. Colonel Guilford seemed disposed to rest, and finding a seat on one of the large i'ullgmlents which had fallen from 13*  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7202-00000076"/> 150        SAINT CECILIA. above, made himself as comfortable as he could, and en- tered into conversation with Ormond. Constance mean-   ! while, looping up the skirts of her riding-dress, strolled  about the beach, staring up at the cliff and its caverns with curious eyes. Many of these were high overhead and quite inaccessible. So she went back to one they had passed, the entrance to which was on a level with the  beach. Just at this spot an old fisherman was leaning  against his boat, as she turned in to explore the cavern. A small stream of water was trickling, out of it. Drops fell from the roof, the floor was covered with fragments of rock; the darkness and ruggedness of the path soon made it dangerous to penetrate farther. Turning, Constance looked through the mouth of the cavern, which served as the frame of a picture to the scene beyond it. There was the pebble-covered beach, the broad sea, with its gently-swell- ing waves slowly rolling in to break in surf upon the shore. Beyond was the bright sky, except where, on the right, the jutting crags of the opposite shore of the inlet broke in upon the horizon. But it was not these distant objects that most strongly attracted Constance's eye. In the foreground was the old fisherman leaning disconsolately against his little wreck of a boat, drawn half way up the shingle beach, while the broken surf played lazily and contemptuously along the keel. Both man and boat seemed worn out in their calling. To Constance's artistic eye this old toiler on the sea, with his bent form, tattered garments, and despondent air, leaning against the crazy wreck, formed a gloomy but striking picture of the moral of life,-that long series of struggles ending in failure and disappointment. She came out of the cavern and drew near to observe him more closely. Finding that he took no notice of her, but stood motionless, she chose a favorable point of view, and seating herself on   SAINT CECILIA.        151 a fragment of rock, began to make a careful study of the objects before her. Meanwhile Colonel Guilford, conversing earnestly with Ormond, kept him by his side, although the younger sol- dier's eye and mind had wandered off to the cavern which he saw Constance enter. And when she came out, took her seat, and worked away at her sketch, he watched her with interest, giving, in liis abstraction, some vague answers to the colonel's remarks. Thus passed a full half hour. At length, without waiting to settle the disputed point,-how many different people, since the dawn of his- tory, had been masters of Malta before it fell into British hands,-Ormond strolled off to where Constance was sitting. Sire had finished her study and now closed her sketch-book, and rose from her seat as he came up to her. "We have no right to hide our light under a bushel," he said; and'in a decided manner but not rudely, he took the book out of her hanld. He had an overmastering way with hinr not easy to resist, although she felt inclined to resent it. Looking first at the drawing, then at the objects pictured there, then back again at the drawing, Ormond was astonished at its spirit and truthfulness. "You have given emphatic expression to the character and circumstances suggested by the subject. Your old fisherman looks indeed as if ' he had toiled all night and had taken nothing.'"  "That is not an inappropriate comment," Constance said. Then added, in a tone of grave reproof, "You seem lmuch given to the irreverent application of Scripture texts." "Why should I not quote Scripture?"Ormond asked. "I must defend myself against the charge of irreverence. The words rise to my lips without my remembering whence I got them. For we find all the characters and conditions of humanity so much more truthfully and forcibly expressed  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7202-00000077"/> 152        SAINT CECILIA. in Scripture than elsewhere, that we remember, and invol- untarily quote its language." "Are you a judge of these things?' she now asked, pointing with mingled confidence and diffidence to her drawing. "Not a bad judge," answered Ormond. "Indeed, I claim to be a very competent judge of the essentials of good drawing. And this will bear criticism. Why, even Herr Rhodoman would prize it highly---- "You know nothing of Herr Rhodoman!" exclaimed Constance, snatching the sketch-book from him. "And you are disposed to laugh at my sketch." "By no means," said he. "You have made Herr Rhodoman well known to me, and on seeing this sketch ly his pupil, I know at once that he himself was a great artist. This drawing is even more expressive than the original before us." The old fisherman, roused by the emphatic tones in which they both had spoken, looked up toward them. Seeing the book and pencil'in Constance's hands, and their eyes fixed upon him, he became aware that he was made the subject of their remarks. He seemed, to suspect that he had been the unconscious object of the contempt anid ridicule which age and poverty too often excite in the young and prosperous.  He turned and was walking moodily away; but Constance hastened after and called to him. As he stopped and turned, she mustered a phrase or two of the Maltese patois and said, "Some catch their fish on the water and some on land," and she slipped a half-crown into his hand. His dull eye brightened as his hand clutched the coin, and Constance saw that she had relieved a case of real distress. Without waiting for thanks, she ran lightly back to Ormond. When I have made any one unconsciously my modcl," l   SAINT CE'CILIA.        153 she said, "I always endeavor to remunerate him in spme way; otherwise I feel as if I had stolen something from him. But papa must be ready for his luncheon. Let us join him." The long ride and fresh air had given the party sharp appetites, and they enjoyed the good things with which Constance's forethought had stored the basket. Colonel Guilford was in no hurry to remount, so they kept their seats on the masses of linmestone which had fallen from the cliff overhead. Here was no danger, as on the British coast, of being caught between the devouring sea before, and the unscalable precipice behind, them. Here on this unchanging shore, which knows no tide, they sat gazing on the scene. The rocky island of Gozzo, close at hand, loomed up before them, and the intervening strait was en- livened by the white sails of many a fishing-boat from either island. "Truly," said Constance, "crowds of these people draw their living from the sea, and many must find their graves there." "A better fate," said Ormond, "than that of your old fisherman, to whom the sea seems to have ceased to afford a living." Ormond did not keep his seat long. In reply to some question which Constance asked, her father mentioned some incident which he had heard as to the blockade and siege of Valetta when it was taken from the French. This led Ormond to speak of the disgraceful circumstances under which it had .fallen into their hands. He had evidently lately made a study of the history as well as the topography of Malta. After quoting the remark made to Napoleon by his engineer, Caffarrelli, on taking possession of Valetta and observing the strength of the place,-"It is well that we found sonie one within willing to open the  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7202-00000078"/> 154       SAINT CECILIA. gates to us,"--the recollection of the cowardly and treach- erous surrender of an almost imtpregnable fortress, from the basest and most mercenary motives, by the chief knights of the order, roused all the scorn and indignation within him. Yielding to i i  lsive  r h s  n f   his isive atue, he s rocky seat, and striding to and fro, in a semicircle, before his companions, like a chained lion, he gave a glowing account of this transaction, just as if he had witnessed it. -ie bitterly denounced several of the leading knights by name, as apostates from their faith and their knightly vows. "Iow unlike to these base creatures, Miss Guilford, were those true knights of Malta, the heroic La Valette and his noble band of brothers, who, two centuries before, defended Malta atainst the Turks! They were the true models of knighthood, the champions of Christendom, the scourge of the infidels! What nobler example can the soldier find than that of the three hundred knights who, not content with defending the castle of St. Elmo until the Turkish cannon had levelled its walls even with the bare rock on which it stood, took the sacramnent by night to prepare themselves for the assault in the morning, and died to a man at their posts, r;:ther than yield one foot to the heatheln host which overwhelmed them! But vou know the history of the siege, and of the order?" he said, turning to Constance. "Very little of either," she answered. ' The order originated in Christian charity, which moved a few zealous individuals to combine their efforts to relieve the sick and sufering pilgrims who arrived in Jerusalem. Their next step was to protect thodefenceless pilgrims in their journeys to and from the holy city; and, as their strength increased, they devoted themselves to making war upon the infidels." After a few more words. on the early history of the order, Ormond, warming with his sub-   SAI NT CECIlIA.        155 ject, gave a graphic account of this memorable siege, to which Constance listened with interest, and soon found herself partaking of his enthusiasm. With his Droud bear- ing, his haughty yet elastic step als lie strode to find fro before her, occasionally pausing at some enlphat ic point in his discourse; with his flashing eye, his curling lip, his burning words, he seemed tilled by the spirit of those whose deeds he narrated, and eager to rival them.

Btut she felt something of tiar of, and for, one whose h strong imnpulses seemed to have so comillete a mastery over him. She reemlmbered the stories told of his connection with the civil war in the Basque plrovicees, and became convinced that the achievements attributed to him, under the title of John Hawkwood, were no fictions. 'After we have dwelt on the heroism displiayed for centurie's by this order of' Clhristian knights," (continued Ormond, , "how revolting is the narrative recorded on tie last page of its history! The very NMoslen, against whom the order had of old devoted itself to war in defence of Christendomt n believe in the true God, although they wor- ship him in error. But the host to which their apostate successor's betrayed their fortress, their order, and their faith, believed in neither God nor devil!' Ormond paused suddenly in his walk and in his entliu- siastic harangue ; for, looking at his companions, he ob- served a sad smile pass over Colonel Guilford's face; and, although Constance was listeniing eagerly, with ler eyes fixed upon him, her cheek flushed, and her heart beating strongly with the emotions his words had awak-  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7202-00000079"/> 156       SAINT CECILIA. ened, yet a little smile flitted about her mouth, and the hand which played with her pencil seemed eager to employ it on the sketch-book held open on her knee. Ormond colored, and laughed with an air of confusion. Then taking two long strides toward her, he gently closed the sketch-book. "Pray do not sketch my likeness, Miss Guilford," he said. "I am sure you will make it a caricature." Blushing and laughing, Constance disavowed any such design; and her father said, "Oh, Constance never in- dulges in caricature. She thinks it would spoil her style." "I hope that consideration will protect me," said Ormond. "And doubtless an artist like Herr Rhodoman would pro- hibit clh an abuse of his art. No, Miss Guilford, never yield to that temptation. The caricature, like the travesty, is in ompatible with elevation of sentiment, fatal to all high art." Then he added, with a laugh, ' You tell me that you make it a point of conscience to remunerate your, models. In my enthusiasm on some subjects I may, at times, make myself ridiculous; but I know not how you could compensate me, should you give that ridicule a per- manent form." "Why, Ormond," said Colonel Guilford, "you are a more modest man than I thought you. I can find multi- tudes ready to denounce your most cherished feelings and convictions, but would be surprised to find any of them attempting to laugh at them, or you." "I should not," said Ormond; "for I am sometimes tempted to laugh at myself." And he resumed his walk, pacing to and fro before them, with a sobered air and a thoughtful brow. Constance's watchful eyes followed him. There may be much of misdirected energy there," she thought. "But he who can find an object of ridicule in earnest feeling, deep   SAINT CEC0LLA.        1 conviction, high aspirations, and resolute purpose, must be frivolous indeed." The sun was now declining, and the party took horse and turned their faces toward Valetta. But Ormond's knowledge of the country enabled him to guide them back by a new route, and point out to them not a few note- worthy objects. When the neighboring country was bare of interest to the traveller's eye, he exerted himself to prove that an agreeable companion is more entertaining than a picturesque route; and he succeeded in making their afternoon's ride as pleasant as that of the morning. As Colonel Guilford dismounted, stiff from being so many hours in the saddle, he pronounced it a successful field-day, and an agreeable exploration of Malta. Con, stance did not say so much, when, with heightened color, she bade Ormond good-evening. But she had brought back with her some vivid pictures printed on her memory, in each of which the same graceful, manly form, with a handsome and animated face, took its place in the fore- ground and gave life to the scene.

"Fair nymph, if fame or honor here To be attained with ease, Then would I come and rest with thee, And leave such toils as these; But hence it dwells, and hence must I With danger seek it forth; To spend the time luxuriously Becomes not men of worth."-DANIEL. AMBITIOUS of distinction, and devoted to his profession, Ormond was in search of a field in which he might follow the career he had marked out for himself, and Europe just now offered none. He had resolved to go to India, but met with delay in exchanging into any regiment already there, or about to be sent there. He chafed at this loss of time. But in order that it might not be altogether lost to his immediate object, he took earnestly to the study of Hindostanee, and of the history and geography of the peninsula. But here he at times needed the aid of something more than books. Many officers have passed years in India and learned as little as they could of the country and the lan- guages spoken in it,-studying only how to make them- selves comfortable in that uncomfortable climate. But finding that Colonel Guilford eould help him in his occasional difficulties, Ormond applied to him. Colonel Guilford loved to recur to India,-the scene of his profes- sional successes; a region with which, widespread as it was, well-used opportunities of observation had made him unusually familiar. The result was that, owing to the retired life he led, this young soldier was the visitor who oftenest crossed his threshold.   SAINT CECILIA.        159 While Ormond was looking eagerly forward to India, Constance was full of hopes of soon visiting Italy. One evening he brought to her some engravings of Italian scenes and works of art, which he had collected on his last visit to that country. Constance examined them with great interest. But he observed, while they were discussing the subjects of these prints, that she had very little knowl- edge of the Italian language. "I am working hard at Hindostanec, Miss Guilford," he said, " to prepare myself for India. Why do you not take up the study of the Italian in anticipation of your tour in Italy?" "I will do so at once," said Constance. "Indeed, I know not why I have put it off so long. Can you recom- mend a master to me?" "Doubtless a competent master can be found here," said Ormond. "With your permission, I will inquire for and send you one." lie fulfilled his conlmission with so much zeal and prompt- ness that two mornings after, when he called on Colonel Guilford with sonic knotty points in his own pursuits to be disentangled by him, he found Constance seated with the lean but learned Italian whom he had sent to her, who was inducting her into the mysteries of his native tongue. "And now, Captain Ormond," said Constance, "al- though you have the start of me, I will run a race with you. I will be conversing at my case with the artists of Italy before you can hold satisfactory conference with the pundits of Hindostan." "That is not a fair match you offer ime," said Ormond, laughing. "  All the cultivated languages of Europe are so much akin that we glide witl comparative ease from one to the other; but in speaking a remote, Oriental tongue,  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7202-00000081"/> 160       SAINT CECILIA. we are transferred, as it were, to another sphere. No. If I should chance to be detained three months in Malta, I expect to converse with you in the language of Petrarch and Dante, Raphael and Michael Angelo. By-the-by, I have Italian books to lend you when you want them." "I shall want them very soon," said Constance, smiling with consciousness of her powers. "I have no Hindos- tanee and Sanscrit books to lend in return; but you will not soon want them." Colonel Guilford and Ormond, both men of active and cultivated minds, had been drawn together by their profes- sional pursuits; but they differed enough in character and convictions to lead to frequent collisions of opinion. To many discussions between them Constance listened atten- tively, but usually in silence. Some of Ormond's views at first startled her; but she was struck by the vigor and in- genuity with which he maintained them. She became convinced that, impulsive as he was, he never acted from mere impulse, but was always ready to give a reason for what he did. She longed to ask him how he, the king's officer on furlough, justified his campaigning with Zumala- carregui, against Spaniards and Englishmen,-his own countrymen and their allies? But was this story true? And what right had she to question him? Since her mother's death, Constance had neglected her music. In the depression of her father's spirits his ear was not attuned to song. But lately she had sung and played occasionally, and her father listened with a revival of the pleasure he bad formerly felt. Her voice had grown richer and fuller than when he heard her sing eighteen months before. She was thus engaged one evening when Ormond called on them. Until now he had not been aware of her musical powers. He waited at the door, listening, with a grave,   SAINT CECILIA.        161 earnest face, without announcing himself, until the song was ended. It seemed to make him melancholy; and he passed the evening with them without asking her to sing again. After this, her father at times requested her to sing when Ormond was with them. He was always an attentive listener, but made no comments. Constance, ob- serving this, said one evening, "You do not care for music, Captain Ormond?" "If you mean that I am not moved by music, you are mistaken," he answered. I am not destitute of the sixth sense, for such it nmay be called, although one may be without it without obvious imperfection. I have it, but have never cultivated it." "And why not?" asked Constance. "Do you not know that we ought to cultivate our powers?" "But we may cultivate some powers to the injury of others flar more important to our usefulness. And that is often the case with music. With men especially, the high cultivation of their musical capacity tends to render then worthless for any other purpose than producing the 'con- cord of sweet sounds.' " Constance felt much disposed to quarrel wnith him for this heresy. Music was a passion with her. She was a skilful performer, and her fine voice was improving daily. But her father took up the question. Hie liked to draw Ormond into discussion; for Ormond had no opinions,- they were all convictions, and lie defended them with ardor and skill. "Music is at once a powerful awakener and soother of the feelings," said Colonel Guilford. "You surely admit that it has great moral influence?" "Say rather great seductive power,", Ormond answered. "Its moral effect is more than doubtful." "*  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7202-00000082"/> 162        SAINT CEGCLIA. "How do you prove that?"Constance exclaimed, roused to defend tthe morality of song. "By tracing the prevalence and effect of the love of music," said Ormond. "Which is the most musical nation in Europe? The effeminate Italians, the successors, not the descendants, of the Romans, nor even of their Northern conquerors. They are, very partially, the offspring of either race, but spring chiefly from the mixed multitude of Roman slaves. The nobler races,-the Romans of classic days, and the Teutonic conquerors of later ages,-spurred on by their native energy and ambition to hazardous enterprise, have been decimated time after time by foreign and civil war; for the lightning of political thunder-storms, like that of nature, strikes the loftiest oaks, and now few scions of either race remain. The very perversions of their tongue show that it comes now from the lips of a new people. The Latin virtus, which expressed a world-conqueringr heroism, has degenerated into the Italian virtu, a frivolous taste for the knick-knacks of ingenuity. Again, the opera of the Roman sage have been perverted into the opera of the Italian fiddler. Who are the famous Italians of our day? Not statesmen, warriors, or authors, but composers, musicians, and prima donnas. And the poets of this day find their best enmployment in the subordinate task of making a libretto on which the maestro may hang his musical compositions. A devotion to music is one of those seductive influences which emasculate the energies given us for high purposes; and the musician becomes, like the lotus-eater, forgetful of duty, country, and kindred ties." Colonel Guilford laughed heartily at this denunciation of musicians, and Constance declared that she would stop her ears; but she did not. "' If you go back to Italy, Ormond, and publish these   SAINT CECILIA.        163 sentiments of yours," said Colonel Guilford, "you will cer- tainly be answered with the stiletto." "That would only be another proof that I had spoken the truth," answered Ormond. "I understand now why Plato, in his 'Republic,' forbade the use of certain styles of music, such as Lydian airs, as corrupting in their effects. I have felt that tendency myself. The truth is, the use of music should be limited to religion and war. We rightly use the trumpet, drum, and fife to awaken the fire of the ruder soldier, more strongly moved by sensuous impres- sions than by noble impulses and high aims; and in raising our voices in adoration of God, an almost uni- versal instinct prompts us to the rhythm and melody of song." "I am glad to find," said Constance, "that your ani- mosity against the musician does not drive him from the two noblest fields for the exercise of his powers." "I will not only leave these to him," answered Ormond, "but will even join voices with him there. But when we look to the characters and career of musicians as a class, particularly those who have given themselves profession- ally to the art, we are struck by the sensuous influence their peculiar gift and pursuit has exercised over them. Of all classes they are most completely slaves to the seductions of the senses." "Yet music," exclaimed Constance, "can excite the most refined and exalted emotions. It can at once awaken and express the passions of the soul." "True, it can excite emotions," said Ormond, "but it cannot control them except by calling up one emotion to displace another, as Collins, in his Ode to' the Passions, exhibits 'Music, heavenly maid,' driving away Fear by Anger, which is displaced by Despair, which yields to Hope, which is thrust aside by Revenge; each passion  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7202-00000083"/> 164       SAINT CECILIA. being overridden only by a more domineering passion; but the hand of no controlling moral governor is seen." "You pervert the poet's panegyric on music into a de- nunciation of it," said Constance. "No, I only use it to show that its influence is emo- tional, not moral. While the perceptions received through the eye chiefly address themselves to the intellect, those received through the ear appeal chiefly to the feelings. The effect of music is simply to excite emotions; under no circumstances does it control them. It cultivates the sensitive nature, not the intellect or the will. Now all virtue lies in the control which the judgment and will ex- ercise over the impulses which would lead us astray. The musical talent is far more of a sensuous than a mental power, and we need but look at the careers of those who have devoted themselves to music, to remark how often this talent is united to the grossest sensuality. We find a remarkable example of this musico-scnsual tem- perament in one who was not only a great tpoet, but a great musician and composer,-King David-- ' "Stop, Captain Ormond!" exclaimed Constance. "That sounds like profanity. King David was God's inspired psalmist." "I mean no profanity," said Ormond; "but it is my conviction that inspiration did not obliterate the original character of the man. We see traits merely human and individual in all the prophets of God ; but in none of them are these traits so strongly marked as in the royal psalmist. In truth, the character of David was to me the greatest stumbling-block in Scripture, until I conceived that his character and career are so fully and vividly de- lineated,-his proclivity to sin plunging him into frequent and enormous guilt, while the reacting impulse of his better nature enabled him to repent, humble himself in   SAINT CEGIL.4.        165 the dust, and find pardon with his God-in order to afford to us a lesson which might uphold us from despair in the midst of our own iniquities, and encourage us to repent and humble ourselves in the hope of finding pardon like him. Not that w/hould compare our temptations with his, but should reember the rudeness of his age, the temptations of his power, and the incomplete revelation under which he lived. He Was doubtless endowed with the highest degree of that dangerous musico-sensual tem- perament, and had to struggle against it through life." "I will not take you for my commentator on Scripture," said Constance. "You mingle too much criticism with your belief." ' You will find that I am merely a believer who is anxious to be able to give you a reason for the faith that is in him," said Ormond. "But we will waive the further discussion of this subject. And now, Miss Guilford, if you will play me a march, sing a hymn, or chant an anthem, you will find nme the most attentive of listeners." "I will never sing for you at all," answered Constance. "You are a slanderer of' the art I love." But she after- ward forgot her resolution, although she long remem- bered and often thought of his remarks on music.  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7202-00000084"/> 166        SAINT CECILIA.

CONSTANCE continued to take her rides out of town with her father; and Ormond, who was much on horseback, contrived to join them occasionally, and alwiays succeeded in adding to the interest of the ride. But there were many things in Valetta itself which Constance had not seen, and he seemed to think himself called upon to direct her attention to them. "Have you seen the paintings in the Collegiate Church, illustrating the life of St. John the Baptist?" "No; I never heard of them before," said Constance, with an awakened interest. "One is by Caravaggio; much injured indeed, but still well worth seeing." At once an hour was named for visiting the cathedral the next day, and Ormond attended as self-appointed cicerone. Constance examined the paintings with great interest, mingling some criticism with lher admiration, uttering mnany lamentations over the ravages which time and negligence had wrought in Caravaggio's picture, and quoting many of Herr Rhodoman's wise sayings, from which Ormond had learned not to dissent. From the paintings, they turned to make a more careful survey of the church they adorned. The pavement at- tracted their eyes as strongly as the windows, walls, and vaulted roof; for it was inlaid with the arms of the suc-   SAINT CECILIA.        167 cessive grand masters, each of whom was a scion of some noble house. At first they saw only a few devotees mum- bling prayers at several different shrines. But the day being a high festival, the cathedral gradually became filled with worshippers,-a number of priests entered the chancel, and the services were begun. Some years had passed since Constance had been in a Romish church. Here everything was on a grand scale, and the desire to observe the striking spectacle, and the multitude of Mal- tese assembled, kept her here. The crowd was evidently well drilled in "external religion," and their air, postures, and gesturcs of devotion were highly attractive to her artistic eye. Ormond, too, was observant, but his counte- nance was marked by a varying expression of interest and provocation. When at length they left the cathedral, Constance said, "I do not think, Captain Ormond, that you joined in the devotions of your Romish brethren." "I did not go there for that purpose," he answered, with a smile. "But I could see that you hardly tolerated their rites." "Why should 1?" said Ormond.   "All Christian churches have been intolerant at times; but nothing but want of power to persecute can bring the Church of Rome to toleration. Its fundamental dogmas make tolera- tion of heresy a crime. And on what grounds can it claim to be the standard of faith? It may in theory hold all essential Christian verities; but it has encumbered and neutralized them with so many dogmas utterly in- compatible with them; it has buried the truth it pretends to,hold under such a pile of rubbish,-the accumulated superstitions of ages,-that itis impossible for an unlearned member of the church to gain access to anything but its idolatrous mummeries."  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7202-00000085"/> 168       SAINT CECILIA. "You speak of the influence of the Church of Rome over the rude and ignorant," said Colonel Guilford. "Are you not aware that many late perverts to Rome from our own church are from among the cultivated and even learned classes? How do you account for that?" "The only species of the bimana known to naturalists," said Ormond, smiling scornfully, " is a very foolish animal. And whatever training they may receive, the bulk of them continue foolish aniimals still. But to speak gravely, the repeated demonstrations of the errors and corruptions of the Romish church tend little to overthrow or to reform it. There may be truth and wisdom in the world, but they do not rule it. Men are chiefly influenced by that which chimes in with their passions and prejudices. Many close- reasoning dreamers indeed have the folly to imagine that the world may be governed by wisdom. But in truth those lead and rule who can enlist the sympathizing folly of the governed, being themselves the highest type of those who make up the mass of nankind. Christianity is ever contending against the tendencies of man's fallen and cor- rupt nature; but the practical working of the rites and dogmas of the Church of Rome have been peculiarly adapted to it; they dovetail with the utmost nicety into that nature as it is. One might say that Popery is the most worldly-wise system that ever the wit of man de- vised. But it is really the gradual result of our own propensity to adulterate and corrupt whatever is pure and true. In all ages men have shown this propensity to fashion their own idol, and then fall down and worship it." "The Romanists have certainly fashioned their idol with much skill," said' Constance, "and made all the arts con- tribute to its attractions." "And the arts have gained much," said Ormond, "by being so employed. It would be difficult to say whether   SAINT CECILIA.         169 the mythology of ancient or nodern Rome has done most for the development of the fine arts." Including the seductive and enervating art of music 1" added Constance, with a mischievous shile, which Ormond understood. ' Bo3th these mythologies," he continued, " are largely tlhe creation of artistic genius, which, however, in striving to ethlercalize the earthly and sensual, has been far more successful in giving an earthy savor to things divine. Setting aside the wliole question as to dogmatic truth or falsehood, the Romanists, with all the aid they have bor- rowed froml the fine arts, and with all the rites, ceremonies, costulme, and embellishnents which they have adopted in their various church services, have not succeeded in devis- ing a religious ceremionial truly solemin and impressive. Trhe simDlieity and subordination of ceremonial is essential to solemnity. I am nlo enemy to forms and rites. With- out sonic regard to theml in reiligious services we cannot even carry out St. Paul's simple injunction, ' Let all things be done decently and in order.' "3Not only at that early period in Christian history, when the church ceased to be governed a nd( guided by in- spired teachers, was it found necessary to adopt creeds and liturgies, and a prescribedl order in worship a'nd in rites, but both Scripture and history indicate that the apostles t hemselves observed an order in conducting public worship, and a method in administering' riites; and when lthey spoke, not by immediate inspiration, their worshilp assumed a liturgical form, as is indicated by the fiequenlt use of the psalmis and otler devotionll parts of Scripture. It is natural that they should do so. Jews by birth and early training, they seem to have adopted whatever in the Jewish ritual was appropriate to worship under the Christian dis- 15  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7202-00000086"/> 170        SAINT CECILIA. pensation, which is the development and fulfilment of that of which the Mosaic was but the type. "Public worship is a solemn thing, being the-union of nany hearts in priayer and praise. That solemnity and union create a need for a liturgy, and prescribed rites, and appropriate embllems. We have the highest and most ancient authority for the use of them ; nor are rites and em- blems mere shadows, but have a substance in themselves. To give an example or two: The white robes, like the linen garments of Aaron and his sons, fix our attention on the priestly office, remind us of the purity that should attend it, and conceal from us the individuality of the man. So the 'soleImn snymbolic act which, in the burial service, accom- panies the words, 'earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,' speaks more emphatically than words can to the heart. And when we build a church to God we may alppropriately crown its spire, or adorn the faiade of its porch, with the emblem of Christ's ignominious death, to remind us of that atonement through which alonewe hope to be redeemed. "I know that there are Christians to whom every pre- scribed rite is superstition or formalism, and the use of every Christian symbol is idolatry. r'lhir religion is made up of Protestantism, and the farther they get from IRome the nearer, they think, they get to truth, forgetting that there is as monstrous error outside of the lpale of the Romish Church as within it. ( Our liturgy and rites, so catholic that tley embody the choice convictions and devotions of every century of Christianity, while excluding the impulses of mere indi- vidual idiosyncrasies, may well give to our branch ot the church militant a training, disciDline, and unity which make it an ' army with banners,' furnished with arms and a spirit fit to fight against the world, sill, and Satan. But when I witness the various ostentatious rites of the Church uf   SAINT CEOCILT A        1 1 Rome, with its elaborate pomp and fantasia, the bustle of its stage trickery, mysteries, and frivolities, the burning of incense, and consecrated tapers, and the sprinkling of holy water, its agnus dei, scapularics and rosaries, the proces- Sions, the elevation of the host, the enshrining of images and relics, the multitude of other observances too numer- ous, superstitious, and idolatrous to mention, I am forcibly reminded of the warlike demonstrations of the Chinese armies, their curious arms and ensigns, their pasteboard fortifications, and the strange antics and wild cries by which these doughty warriors seek to-frighten their ene- mies, but of little more avail than the squibs, crackers, and gaudy paper lanterns of their festivals. So far from these demonstrations lelping them in their fight with the great enemy of man, I believe the devil is not a whit scared, but enjoys the fun." "With your views as to the necessary influence of folly and falsehood over the bulk of mankind," said Colonel Guilford, " you cannot take a hopeful view of the progress of religious truth. Still it is refreshinfg to meet with so stanch a Protestant as you are."' "I scorn the name of Protestant," said Ormond. "And any church errs greatly which assumes that title as an essential characteristic. In taking' that name it adopts an accident for the essence, and describes itself by a nega- tion which only serves to magnify the importance of Rome, makiing opposition to it an essential part of the foundation on which it builds its faith. This has given a tnegative character to Protestantism, greatly enfeebling it in its struggle against the positive dogmatism of Popery.' Names are things. 'Suppose that Copernicus had published his true theory of the planetary motions, under the title of the Anti-Ptolemaic system, then. univcrsally received, would not this negative definition have been a gross misnomer?  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7202-00000087"/> 172        SAINT CECILIA. Imagine the church in the fourth century, when, as St. Athanasius says, all the world seemed to have turned Arian, entitling itself the Anti-Arian Church. How absurd would this have been! Just so has it been with every branch of the church which has entitled itself Protestant. Thank God I we have a national church, national at least in name, although less so in fact than it ought to be. Having a name of its own, ancient as the first planting of Christianity, the Church of England need not take the accidental neces- sity of protesting against the errors, corruptions, and usurpations of Rome as part of its descriptive title. Through God's providence it was able to correct its own abufes and errors, derived chiefly from Rome, and might be what it is if the Church of Rome had never erred or never existed. The word of God, and the primitive organi- zation of Christ's church, were planted almost contempora- neously in Italy and in Britain. And if revealed truth had been obliterated there by the henthen Saxon conquerors, it might quite as well have been restored through other channels, the Greek Church, for instance, then embracing more than half of Christendom, now inclosing in its fold seventy millions of souls, holding still, except on two points, perhaps needlessly defined, the same dogmatic faith that we do; being now, and having long been, far less cor- rupted in its rites and dogmas than its Roman sister. And yet," added Ormond, after a thoughtful pause, "1 would hesitate to destroy the Church of Rome,"-'a-nd he made an energetic sweep of the arm, as if thrusting some one from his path,-" for the tendency of the age is to substitute not pure and living truth, but utter unbelief, for Romish Christianity overlaid and almost stifled by error." "Upon my word, Ormond," Colonel Guilford exclaimed, "you are the must promising champion of the Church of England I have lately met with,-so zealous a soldier of   SAINT CECILIA.        173 the church militant should be sent forth to widen the pale of its comnnunlion. But the flashing of your eye, and that energetic gesture of your outstretched arm, make me fear that you would conquer error and win proselytes more after the fashion of Mohammed than St. Paul " "will not be laughed out of the truth," said Ormond; "and am ready to maintain all I have asserted - " "By pen, tongue, or sword?" asked Colonel Guilford. "By either or all of them," answered Ormond, laugh- ing. "But we will waive this matter now." "It is certainly a great comfort," said Colonel Guilford, "to have found an orthodox church on whose teachings we can rely. That assumption of infallibility forms one of the great attractions of Rome."' "I claim no infallilility for our church," anlswered Ormond. "Although the apostles, in rearing the primi- tive church, were under a g!dance which preserved them from error, since that (ay every branch of it, in every land, has been in a measure the work of men not guided by inspiration. All churches have erred, more or less: I only claim the least amount of 'lror for ours." "There is an amount of moderation in that opinion,"' said Colonel Guilford, "that gives me some hope of you. If you should chance to live twice as long as you have done, you may get over your own infallibility, and become in counsel and action a safe man to follow." 15*  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7202-00000088"/> 174        SAINT CECIL A.

THE delightful winter of the Mediterranean had passed away, and Ormond bad not yet procured an exchange. At first he was very impatient at this delay in commencing his career in India; but became more reconciled to it while devoting himself to his Oriental studies. During this time he saw much of Colonel Guilford and of Constance; but did not soon acknowledge to himself the share which the daughter had in attracting him to the father's house. When forced to admit it, he was ingenious in justifying hiliself in this indulgence. In the zealous search for active service in his profession, he was about to cut himself off from many of the social advantage. which a man of his birth and means could command at will in Europe. Why should he not indulge himself in the enjoyment of agree- able society during the brief period before his departure, and carry away with him at least the memory of some pleasant hours? While he was on the eve of going to India, for go he would, he saw that both Constance and her father were already looking forward to that visit to Italy on which, from the direction early given to her thoughts and tastes, she had set her heart. Their paths must soon lead them  far apart. Why not enjoy the present hour?   SAINT CECILIA.        175 5 Some persons unfriendly to Ormond, for every ener- getic, strong-willed mran, is sure to have enemies, whis- pered it about thalt he would leave his regiment otherwise than by getting an exchange. A clue, they said, had been found identifyiung him with John Hawkwood of Basque notoriety; and he would be court-martialed and cashiered for this gross breach of neutrality and military discipline. But Ormond never heard these whispers. And no inge- nuity could draw him into a discussion of the incidents of the late civil war in Spain. He appeared equally ignorant of and indifferent about the matter. In his frequent visits to Colonel Guilford he still talked and inquired about India, for his thoughts were full of it. One evening they were naking estimates of the popula- tion of the peninsula, and of the number of Europeans there. After adding up all in the civil aand military ser- vice of the the company, the king's troops, and all others unconnected with the Lovernment, Colonel Guilford could not estimate the British in India at more than a hundred thousand. "Yet this small numlber," he said, " not over a third of whom are soldiers, control and govern more than a hun- dred millions of natives. Could there be a stronger proof of the superiority of civilization over barbarism!" "Say, rather," observed Ormond, "of the superiority of one  e race over others." "But surely," said Colonel Guildford, "it is chiefly to our civilization that we owe otir superiority?" "Was it the higher civilization of the Normans," Ormond asked, "which made thenm princes and nobles, the rulin, caste, in short, in every country into which they mpde their way,--even in small numbers,--and this even in the most cultivated parts of Europe? There is a pestilent error pervading the world of late, which puts  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7202-00000089"/> 176       SSAINT COECILIA. cause for effect and effect for cause, on the most vital point in sociology. What makes civilization? Institu- tions do not make races, but races make institutions. All history proves that all civilization is the result of the pro- longed efforts of high races; and that as these become mixed with inferior races their civilization declines. It proves too that the civilizations of no two races are the coun- terparts of each other; and that there are races so inferior that they cannot even receive, much less originate, any civilization whatever. The world has not seen, within the historical period, any unmixed race changed in its essential and peculiar characteristics by a change of its condition." Colonel Guilford liked to rouse his young companion's speculative yet dogmatic spirit. So he remarked, "I am afraid, Ormond, you hold many political heresies incom- patible with the democratic tendencies of the age." I am at war with the democratic tendencies of the age," said Ormond. "Doubtless they are distasteful to many of us," said Colonel Guilford; " but the world is fast embracing tlem, and we will have to submit.7" "I am not going to submit," said Ormond, defiantly. "But you cannot fight single handed against the world." "Not successfully; but I have a potent ally on my side." "And who is this potent ally?"Colonel Guilford asked. "Nature!" said Ormond. "The nature which God stamps on individuals, on families, on races of men, and on man's social relations." "Nature, then, fights with you, does she?" said Colonel Guilford. Then, leaning back in his chair, he added, "I do not like philosophizing for myself, it costs much labor,   SAINT CECILIA.        1" which is often thrown away; but I know, Ormond, that you are ever ready to build up a theory, and to defend it like a fortress entrusted to your keeping. So explain to me how nature will operate in putting down the democratic spirit of the age." "The great popular error," said Ormond, " is the asser- tion that men are by nature equal, and that the amount and value of humlan rights can be ascertained by counting heads. This is flying in the face of nature, and attempt- ing to force ler to deal in equalities, while she so delights in inequalities that she never yet made any two things exactly equal. What are called the natural rights of man are confounded with their natural capacities, which are unequal in any two persons; and the nearest approach we can make to equality of rights is, the equal right to employ unequal capacities. We need no better proof of the inequality existing among men than the notorious fact that if we placed all mannkind on a footing of perfect equality to-day, we would find among them monstrous inequalities of condition next year, next month, and even to-morrow. The conditions of men are based not on natural, but on acquired or inherited rights, or on the want, of them, "We see different individuals and different races en- dowed with widely differing capacities, and that indi- viduals vary endlessly in the use or abuse of their natural gifts. All knowledge, skill, property, all human acquisi- tions, are the result of the capacity, industry, and foresight of individuals, and become to them new and valuable rights All human progress and civilization spring from the efforts of individuals, who constitute, not the mass, but the exceptions among nankind. "Now, these extraordinary efforts are prompted by two instinctive motives, most highly developed in the higher  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7202-00000090"/> "7        SAINT CECILI'A. types of mankind: the desire to better our own condition, and the desire to better the condition of our offspring. The progress and civilization of the human race spring quite as much from the latter as the former. The father is anxious not only to secure to his offspring the advan- tages which his labor, ingenuity, and foresight have won for himself; he desires not only to transmit to them his skill and knowledge, but to endow them with the results of his exertions, and thus raise them above the small be- ginnings of his own early career. This parental instinct, this anxiety for the advancement of our posterity, has, everywhere, and at all times, contributed more to human progress than all other causes combined; not merely bv furnishing a great motive for human exertion, but, more especially, by enlabling the offspriug of the successful to begin their career from a vantage-ground which could only be attained by the bodily and mental toil of past genera- tions. These inherited advantages, varying the conditions and multiplying the pursuits of men, have led to a more complex and complete organization of society, and to a social and political civilization, in which the colnbiited effects of men's growing knowledge, skill, and wealth not. only raise the successful and their offspring to a condition of plenty, ease, cultivation, and refinement, but promote tile welfare of tlme bulk of the community by multiplying, cheapening, and bringing within their reach the necessa- ries of life, and comforts, conveniences, and even luxuries in an abundance, and with a certainty utterly unknown in a primitive, rude, and insecure state of society. It brings within their reach not only material, but moral and intel- lectual acquisitions. "There are some necessary results of civilization which look like evils, but are not so. In a civilized land all the material gifts of God, save the sun's light, the free air,   SAINT CECILIA.        179 and the running water, have already each found an owner. But it is this very appropriation of all things, to the ex- clusive use of individuals, which has mulltiplied a thousand.- fold their capacity togratify the wants of man, and enabled many to live where one would starve. What is the effect of this appropriation? The permlanent occupation of that portion of the earth's surface that can be brought under cultivation; the value of the crude materials taken fromu it, after they have been wrought into forms useful to man; the existence of the domesticated animials reared by him ' and useful to himl ; in short, all the material means fur. nished by a region, which, as a hunting-ground, yielded but a precarious living to a few savages, and now provides a steady supply to the wants of a nation. All this is the result of the exercise of man's natural right to take ex- clusive possession of such part of the materials, or the domain of nature as has not already been appropriated by another man, and of his further right to transmit them to his offspringl. Inheritance lies at the foundation of civili- zation. But the clrzy political dreamers of this tag'e would not only trample on all hereditary and vested rights, but they openly declare that ' p'roperty is theft.' ' That inheritance is the basis of civilization is obvious when we consider wheat would be the effect of a law which should ordain that, on each nian's death, his acquisitions should be distributed among the conmunity at large. In- genuity would at once be tasked to evade the operation of this law. Men would aim, as they always do in countries where property is not safe, to give it such a form as would render it portable and easy to conceal. The enterprise and perseverance to which we owe the great permanent improvements which mark wealthy anld prosperous coni- nmunities,-lands cleared, drained, inclosed, and brought into cultivation at ian expense only to be repaid by a long,  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7202-00000091"/> 180        SAINT CECILIA. series of harvests,--spacious and durable dwellings, great factories, costly machinery, great miniing enterprises, fleets of nmerchantmen, with a multitude of like undertakings in art, commerce, science, and letters, requiring great outlay in time and labor, and adding vastly to a nation's means of subsistence, comfort, and security, all would be so much discouraged that a highly-civilized country, under the influence of such legislation, would speedily relapse into barbarism." You have established the necessity of recognizing the rights of property and inheritance," said Colonel Guilford. "But how does this bear upon the organization of govern- ment?" "Very directly," said Ormond. "The exercise of the instincts and capacities which tend to raise men above mere animal life and establish and promote civilization, produce vast and startling discrepancies in the conditions of individuals. The bulk of acquired rights will always be found vested in the few, and there will be a compara- tive destitution of them among the many. Yet, if it be God's design that man's condition should be one of progress, and this progressive improvement be the result of the ac- quisition and accumulation of riglts by individuals, these rights must be secured to them. And for their protection some form of government is called into existence ; for government is not an end in itself, but a means to an end. Nor has it for its object the clothing of men with political power, or even the bestowing on them any direct bounty. Its sole end is, not to create rights, but to protect rights; and it is the representative rather of rights than of persons. AWe will better understand this by remembering that all knowledge, skill, and acquisitions are the result of the labor of individuals; for governments do not work, do not produce anything. They generate neither wealth,   SAINT CECILIA.        181 knowledge, nor skill. All the means of action a govern- ment can have arc obtained fromr individuals; for it is only so far as it can avail itself of the strength, skill, and acquisitions of individuals that it can act at all. "IBut the powers of government must be intrusted to hmallllln ll gets, and may be abused. If intrusted to one man, righlts must take the clhance of the character of that' one man, uand may be trampled upon instead of being pro- tected. But if political power be equally distributed among all men, whiile ile bulk of rights are necessarily vested in a comparative few, tlese few are sure to be plundered,-either directly by robbery, or indirectly by a system of taxation amounting to partial confiscation. For the average honesty of mankind is not sufficient to restrain their cupidity, nor their average wisdom sufficient to point out to them the ruin they bring on the community and thmcselves by tralnpling upon private rights." "According to your views," said Colonel Guilford, "government does not reprcsent the body or majority of the nation." "Whlat do you mean by the majority of a nation??" asked Ormond.  "Government represents rights. The superiority of the rightse of the mere nunimeical majority is assumed on utterly false grounds. If all the rights, both primitive and acquired, of every individual were num- bered and weighed, we would find the bulk of them, and especially those which have created civilization, in the possession of a decided, perhaps a small, minority; espe- cially if we include in these acquisitions knowledge, ability, and skill; and, what is more, this minority will be found to be the stronger part of the nation, and, if united, able to control it. They are the true majority,--the majority in powers and in rights; and 'it is only by a forced and unnatural organization of society that they can be made 16  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7202-00000092"/> 1 S2       SAINT CECILIA. other tlan the 'pars major ct melior' of the nation. The attempt to enforce a political equality, and thus give the rule to mere numbers, is a struggle against nature, and will always be evaded. It is as .absurd to- attribute the superiority of rights, and the right to govern to the mere numerical majority of a nation, as to the numerical Imajority of a joint-stock company, in which nine hundred persons hold one-tenth of the stock, and one hundred persons the other nine-tenths. In such a company, so governed, we might soon see the directors voting dividends per capita, instead of per share. Men adopt no such absurd rule in their ordinary lpartnerships. Why should they in the great associations called governments?" "You have skilfully sapped and blown up the political fortress of popular sovereignty," said Colonel Guilford. "Let us see what you will piut in its place." "N o one but a fool," said Ormond, "looks in this world for a perfect government. Political wisdom consists in finding some middle ground, affording a strong position against the despot and the mob. This' can be found by intrusting political power only to those who have both personal and proprietary rights, and to each individual somewhat in proportion to his prolrietary rights. Upon somewhat such a basis as this all past civilization and liberty have been built; and the past is not all folly; we can extract much wisdom from it. "Even this limitation allows a wide range for the dis- tribution of political power. But, practically, this power is most conveniently and safely vested in the whole class of landholders.

Their own interests are obviously inseparable from that of the coun- try; its prosperity is theirs. They are too independent in position to fall easily under the control of ambitious or designing men.. They necessarily embrace a large proportion of the educated class. Indeed, the mere pos- session of property, begetting forethought and reflection, brings with it an education of the best kind. And their influence and resources enable them at, once to sustain the government, and select, yet control the high officials who are charged with the administration of its powers." "So, Ormond,' said Colonel Guilford, " your theory ends in a kind of oligarchy?" "Not exactly. I am building up government on. what is a solid, and may be a broad, foundation. But necessity and a wise use of political experience have usually led nations a step further. Every government must lhave a, head ; and the violent and disastrous convulsions which have resulted from the struggles of ambitious leaders to attain this first place in government, may well teach us the advantage and necessity of filling that post by the unvarying rule of hereditary succession. Such a govern- ment becomes a limited mlonarchy. The monarch becomes the great preserver of the peace, especially by cutting off the occasion for those frequent struggles of dangerous amnbition in its efforts to seize the highest place. The allegiance of the nation becomes fixed on some family his- toricallv connected with the fortunes of the country. And able. and aspiring mlen now seek, not to rule over the country, but to serve it; while the bulk of political power is vested in a class too powerful alnd too conservative to be tyrannized over. We thus obtain an organization which has usually possessed the two essential requisites  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7202-00000093"/> 184        SAINT CECILIA. of governments, tenacity in defence of rights, and dura- bility, without which the former is of little value. "But a new school of politics has arisen which deifies mere numbers and brute force, and which, when followed to its necessary ultimate results, is hostile to all the vested and hereditary rights which lie at the foundation of civili- zation. The aiming and striving after liberty which mark this age spring' Irom a totally different spirit than that which led to the reformation and the religious wars. This spirit is closely allied to infidelity, to disbelief in the moral government of God's world. It aims far less at the main- tenance or acquisition of rights by individuals, than at ridding them of all restraints, human and divine. It seeks to let loose the rabble to plunder the rights, and the wealth accumulated through ages. rWhat is democracy?  It is the absurdity of intrusting the powers of government not to the head, but to the heels. When we see the ignorance and incapacity of most men of the educated class, and how few of them are fit to fill official posts, or exercise political authority, how absurd is it to imagine that the mass of mankind can intelligently take part in governiient, or even select fit agents td exercise its power! 'The theory of democracy requires that the people should fairly choose, out of the whole community, the best and wisest men for public office. But the theory and practice are as wide apart as heaven and earth. This choice of the best gives rise to the most corrupting strug- gles, and the strangest results. It would seem that it is far easier to deceive a multitude than an individual. And deceivers of the multitude are never wanting. The flat- tery and falsehood of courtiers are proverbial; and the king is pitied for being surrounded by lmen who shut out from him the truth. But the falsest courtiers are not found in the palace. More gross in their flattery, more   SA4INT CECILIA.        185 false to their pledges, more Proteus-like in their many and sudden transformations, more shameless in their effrontery, more corrupt and corrupting, are the courtiers of the people, overflowing with professions of love for that people, and ldevotion to their cause, and not caring a farthing for any one man of them. And the people, in their turn, are easily, nay, willingly, deceived. For when we look into the characters of successful and unsuccessful candidates for popular favor, we find that integrity, or the want of it, has little or no influence in the canvass; and the people constantly intrust important offices to men whom not one in ten of them would trust with his purse. Nor is it real ability which gives the candidate success; for the art of obtaining office is totally distinct from the capacity to fulfil its duties. The popular favor is won by personal solicita- tion, low and corrupt intrigue, and that style of oratory which appeals, not to the reasoning faculty, but the pre- judices and passions of the ignorant. That would be a rare popular assembly, in which the most persuasive orator was the wisest and most trustworthy counsellor at hand t The truth is, that, under every form of government, the few lead and govern, and the many follow and obey. And election by the democracy is the worst possible mode of choosing the few who must rule. The boasted democ- racies of ancient Greece and Italy, so lauded by historians and orators, were in truth slavehloldin oligarchies-and the citizens a privileged class. True democracy is not a perlmanent form of governmlent, but a transition state, through which political society sometilmes passes. Its usual goal is to throw itself into the arms of a despot to escape the intolerable tyranny of the mob.7" "All history, I believe, confirms your assertion," said Colonel Guilford. "But in reconstructing society on your 16*  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7202-00000094"/> 186       SAINT CECILIA. basis, Ormond, are you not merely rebuilding the feudal system?" "No, I have only availed myself of the best materials in it, throwing aside the rubbish, its abuses, and cor- ruptions. But, in truth, I am -not devising a form of gov- ernment, but merely pointing out one which has usilally led nations from barbarism to civilization, and is com- patible with the highest condition attainable by man. For government exists and is necessary, not for the pur- pose of bestowing bounties, but for the prevention of evils; and hereditary, limited monarchy is the polity most natural to man."' "Upon my word, Ormond," said Colonel Guilford, with a smile, "you are bold and far-reaching in your views on government. Had you not better turn statesman? With your family interest you can easily get into Parlia- ment. And who knows what you might not accomplish there!" "I would accomplish nothing tlere," said Ormond. "Moreover, the questions I have at heart are not settled by parliaments. Nature has a rougher school and harsher teachers for the instruction of an ignorant populace and a blundering nation." He was silent for a moment. A deep shade of gravity passed over his face, and his keen eye seemed to look inquiringly into the future. Then, stretch- ing out his arm, he said, "All these questions are ulti- nately settled by the sword."  "By the sword!" said Constance. "Pray, Captain Ormond, is fighting the chief end of man?" "Of some men, and even of some races, apparently," said Ormond, smiling. "At least, in this rough world it seems to be the chief means by which superiority asserts its rights. Do you think that the Normans, that singular and remarkable race, gifted above all others with the   SAINT CECILIA.        187 head to conceive, the heart to dare, and the hand to achieve the greatest enterprises, could have shut thenm- selves up in their frozen north, and forborne to assume the positions of princes and leaders in the south of Europe?" "You have a great admiration for the Normans," said Constance. "Other nations, as eminent in war,-the Greeks and the Romans for instance,---have left valuable legacies to after-ages, in arts, letters, and institutions. What have the Normans left us? - What did they in- vent?" "They invented the gentleman and the lady," said Ormond. "They cultivated a refinement of manners, an elevation of sentiment, never attained to before their day. To them we owe the point of honor, the spirit of chivalry, and whatever is best in the tone of modern society. Nor would it be possible to say how much of the energy, enter- prise, and genius of the British people may be due to the infusion of their blood. Doubtless it has elevated us among nations. You, especially, are very ungrateful to them in forgetting that you owe to them much of what you are." "I beg their pardon," said Constance, laughing, " for my ignorance or forgetfulness. Their invention of the gentleman and the lady was quite a clever thing." If Colonel Guilford had not sunk into a reverie, medi- tating perhaps on Ormond's political discourse, he might have been struck with the contrast between Ormond's im- petuous and dogmatic assertion of his political convictions and his gallant and tender tone when he turned to address Constance. But he did not seem aware that he had ad- mitted a falcon into his dovecot. NWhen Constance, first knew Ormond she was often startled by the boldness of his views, his craving for daring enterprise, and the energy which was ready to  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7202-00000095"/> 188       SAI NT 'CEOILIA. trample upon every obstacle that stood in his way. But he knew how to present in the most favorable light to others as to himself those convictions which fostered his own impulses. Even on those points on which they dif- fered most, lie soon brought her to Sir Roger de Coverley's conclusion, that much could be said on both sides of the question; and was fast leading her to the conviction that he was always right, and they who differed from him, always wrong. She thought, too, that she herself had modified some of his harsher and more extravagaut opinions, or at least the expression of them; and she was flattered at exercising an influence over his energetic nature and strong will. But she did not see so plainly the influence he exercised over herself, nor discover how much of her zeal and indus- try with the pencil, and in the acquisition of the Italian tongue, wiis due to the interest he took in her pursuits. He had this evening much to say to her and she to him. There were sketches to be looked at and songs to be heard; for Ormond had fallen away from his rigid faith as to the true use of music. Many questions were asked as to Signor Boccalini and her progress under his tuition. And Ormond had to test that progress by saying to her many things in that soft tongue, and extracting answers in the same. "And now are you ready for the 'Divina Commedia?" Ormond asked, as he was taking leave. "Signor Boccalini thinks not," said Constance. "But I think I am. So send me Dante to-morrow. I long to make the acquaintance of the great Florentine." I will send him to you, clad in a court-dress, which becomes him well," said Ormond. And, accordingly, a copy of a handsome edition, beautifully illustrated, made its appearance the next morning.   SA4INT CECILIA.        189 With all the earnestness with which Ormond was quali- fying himself for a successful career in India, with all the zeal with which Constance was preparing to make the most of her approaching visit to Italy, yet these young people were making the worst possible preparation for taking divergent paths in life. CHAPTER    XVI. "' O how this spring of love resenblcth The uncertain glory of an April day; Which now shows all the beauty of the sun, And by-and-by a cloud takes 1ll away!" Two GENTLEMEN OP VrERONA. ORMOND having duly sent the Divina Cozmmedia to Constance, she at once commenced the study of it, con- trary to the advice of Signor Boccalini, who held to the old prejudice that we should learn to creep before we walk, and to walk before we run. Hlo wished to ground Con- stance thoroughly in modern Italian prose before she ventured on old Italian verse. But her youth and ardor could not wait on his age and caution, and she plunged eagerly into the intricate but beautiful labyrinth of the master-poet of Italy. What could be more natural than that Ormond, having himself threaded the mazes of this labyrinth, should some- times come t9 see what progress she was making, and to help her at the difficult points? Before this time he had occasionally called at the house, of a morning, while Colonel Guilford was absent on duty, and after Signor Boccalini had given his lesson and gone away. But now  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7202-00000096"/> 190       SAINT CECIL IA. these morning visits became more frequent and longer. There were many knotty points to be disentangled in the Divina Cornmzedia; then the nicer shades of meaning in some Italian song had to be explained before Constance sung it, for Ormond had fallen from his rigid demand that music should be reserved for devotion and war. Then there was some new sketch to be looked at, or he had to inspect the progress she had made in the painting she had on hand. Thus a large part of many a morning and evening glided swiftly and delightfully away. Yet Ormond was at times more restless and moody than his associates had ever known him. Colonel Guilford observed the change in him, and attributed it to provocation at his successive failures to procure an exchange, which would enable him to commence his career in India. His eagerness on this point was evident, not only from his conversation, but from his earnest efforts to ma'ster the languages of India, and make himself familiar with the history and geography of the country, and the character and condition of the people. Constance's eyes had long been opened to Ormond's impetuous and daring temper, which prompted him to trample upon all obstacles which stood between him and his ends. She was convinced that his aims were high and honorable, for he had made a convert of her to many of his convictions. But from the first moment since she 1ad learned to take an interest in him, she had felt an anxiety for him. A man of his temperament will not only be often running into personal danger, but into danger of commiittin deeds to be repented of. She no longer doubted his iden- tity with the adventurous "John 1awkwood,"1 for he had inadvertently betrayed to her a knowledge of the Basque tongue. "How much does he stand in need," thought   SAIINT CECILIA.        191 Constance, "of some friendly influence which might temper that impetuosity so dangerous to his safety, to his innocence!"And she blushed, yet thrilled with pleasure at the conviction that she herself had more than once exer- cised such an influence over him. But soon she would have no opportunity of exerting that influence. It was now certain that Ormond would shortly leave Malta. Evenlshould he fail to obtain the exchange he sought, his regiment was about to be transferred to another post,-and Constance sighed. She and her father were about to lose a friend. "And Captain Ormond seems sorry, too," she muttered to herself. "He is often grave and moody now. His spirits have been very variable of late--and I will not have time even to finish reading Dante with him.'"For these readings had become frequent. Yet they were not likely to finish with Dante soon. After making their way through the Hell and Purgatory, they had gone but a little way in Heaven when they turned back to recommence with the Hell. For, as Ormond re- narked, even the greatest poet, whose luxuriant genius may revel in descriptions of earthly or infernal scenes and passions, al\ways breaks do6wn when he rises to the celestial regions. Both Dante and Milton afford proofs of this. One morning Colonel Guilford returned fatigued from duty; for, with the return of the Maltese summer, a little exertion sufficed to fatigue him. On entering the house he saw Constance and Ormond seated side by sidedeeply occupied wijh their book, and each had a hand upon it. They were too much engrossed in it to observe her father's arrival. Ormond was reading the passage in the Purga- tory in which Dante so concisely but touchingly tells the sad tale of Francesca of Rimini. As he read, her heightening color, the confiding gaze she turned upon him, the fixed at- tention with which she hung upon his words, full toned  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7202-00000097"/> 192         SSA IN' CECILIA. but thrilling with emotion, excited, perhaps, by the passage on wh ich he dwelt,-all this flashed a new light on Colonel Guilford's mind. He gazed steadily on the unconscious pair, and turned pale. Then, treading softly, he passed through the house into the garden, and walked to and fro beneath his orange-trees. How blind had he been; how forgetful of his own youthl What could be more natural I He remembered how much, of late, they had been thrown together. -Iow much-was there in each to fascinate the otlhe r! Yet how could he have foreseen it? From the first hour she had met with the restless Ornmond she knew that he was on the point of setting out for India, where he must devote long years to the attainments of his ambitious aims. However he might surprise and dazzle her, she knew he was but a meteor, no abiding star. But now he loitered, loath to tear himself away. These young people, whose minds seemed bent on their separate objects in Italy and India, had now found one common subject to engross their thoughts. Broken in health, spirits, and fortune, worn out in ser- vice, with his professional aspirations ungratified, Colonel Guilford felt that his dalughter was everything to him. If she were taken from him, what a blank would life become 1, But this was selfishness; and, stamping his foot upon the earth, he trampled down the feeling. For that daughter he would make any sacrifice. He would forget himself and think of her alone. Did Ormond loiter in Malta unable to tear himself awa:y from her? In birth, in for- tune, in personal merit he had everything to recommend him. But how unlit was he for domestic life! Restless, ambitious, ready to plunge into any enterprise, however hazardous, which promised to gratify that ambition; with a self-confident impetuosity which trampled on all   SAINT CECII, A.       193 obstacles, marriage would not change his nature, nor perhaps divert him one moment from his course. With Constance's earnest, devoted nature, what chance would she have of happiness, if united to hini? An anxious, perhaps neglected wife,-how soon probably a widow 1 Colonel Guilford thought of his own wife. With all his professional aspirations, he had sought his happiness in domestic life. Yet what years of suspense, anxiety, and privation had she uncomplainingly suffered, during his frequent and long absence on service! But with Ormlond, full of "o'ervaulting ambition" and-vast and visionary schemes, domestic life was but a collateral matter, and Constance, with all her devotion, would be but a second- ary object with him. These anxious thoughts were yet busy within him, when Constance issued from the house, and with light step and beaming eye came up to him. Sliding her arm into his, she joined him in his promenade under the orange- trees. "How long have you been at home, papa? I did not observe when you came in." ' I have been at home an hour perhaps. But you and Ormond were so busy with your book that neither ob- served me when I entered." He glanced at her anxiously. But she turned her head away and plucked an orange- blossom. Yet the flush on her cheek ran down and showed itself on her fair neck as she answered, "Captain Ormond is an exacting teacher. I think I must dismiss. him and stick to Signor Boccalini. But I believe he is not more exacting to me than to himself. And I have learned much from him." "I have no doubt of it," said her father, dryly, almost sadly. There was something in his tone which drew Constance's eyes to his face. But ie had at once checked 17  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7202-00000098"/> 'J4:       A141T CtCILIA. the expression of his feelings; and she only saw a pale cheek, and an air of languor, which drew her thoughts to him. "You have come home fatigued, father; and add' to that fatigue by walking here." And with her arm in his she turned toward the house. "A little exertion fatigues me now," said Colonel Guil- ford. "' Time can tame the starkest wight.' But wounds, disease, and hardships do the work more speedily than time." After a pause, he added, "There is Ormond, brimful of energy,-action is the breath of his nostrils. He lives only to seek adventure, face danger, and endure hardship. Peace to him is lethargy. Domestic ties would vainly seek to trammel him in his ambitious career. For with him every other object than a soldier's success fills but a fleeting thought. Yet his step may become as tame as mine is, should he chance to live so long." Constance hung her head, and they entered the house in silence. She had not heart to speak, and her father froml this moment resolved that no selfish motive should lead him to breathe a wish as to the issue of that which now occupied all his thoughts. They sat together until dinner was announced. Constance pretended to be occupied with a book. But she often turned a stolen glance upon her father. For months she had not seen him so pale and languid. But there was also an anxiety stamped upon his brow, and she sighed as she truly interpreted the cause of it. Two days passed before she again saw Ormond. He was in no humor for visiting. His mind was tempest- tost between conflicting impulses. He had at last received an offer of excharnge into a regiment in India, and had permnission to accept it. Nothing prevented his at once leaving Malta. Why did he loiter here? He paced up   A llV l' u'u ',ILA.      19b5 and down his room in all the agonies of a prompt and resolute spirit, which had never before known the strug- gles of intlecision. He made an effort to calmn himself, to check the impatience which hurried him to and fro like a caged lion,--and throwing himself into a chair, resolutely kept it for half an hour. From boyhood to this hour his thoughts, his dreams, had centred on a soldier's life. All his energies had been directed to the attainnient of eminent success in that career. But Europe seemed now bent on the enjoyment of peace, and if he was to rise in his profession no dis- tance nor climate must deter him from seeking a field on which he could win a soldier's reputation. In this career nothing would tralmmel him more than an early marriage. He had never dreamed that he might fall under any in- fluence strong enough to contend with his ambition. But now he did not stop to inquire how much he valued Con- stance. Did she care for him? He believed, he hoped she did. Yet he tried to persuade himself that it would be a relief to know that she was not entangled in the same snare in which he had been taken. This would nerve himt to follow resolutely, with unwavering steps, the path he had marked out for himself. Could he ask Constance to leave her father abruptly, and hurry with him to India? Impossible! Could he ask her to pledge herself to him, and wait long years whil ie e pursued the hazardous career which alone could secure his object? Could he ask her to make every sacrilice, and oler none in return? Ite could not solve this question, for he could not sacrifice his ambition, or any chanlie of gratifying it. It was useless thinking about this matter. He could not now decide, yet must soon come to a decision. Seizing his hat he we(nt out, and walked toward headquarters with no definite object. As lie reached the top of the flight of  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7202-00000099"/> 196       SAINT CECIL TA. steps into which the steep street, like many others in Valetta, was cut, he saw Colonel Guilford at a distance. As he drew nearer he was struck with his careworn look. But he was more struck when on hastening forward to speak to him, Colonel Guilford merely bowed, coldly enough, as Ormond thought, and turned into the entrance of the governor's mansion. Ormond's face flushed with something very like anger; but he passed on and took a long stroll on the ramparts. At length he found himself not far from Colonel Guilford's residence. He had not forgotten the cold bow he had lately received. "Has Constance been schooled to receive me as coldly? And has she learned her lesson? The sooner I know this the better." And he hurried on to put her to the proof. Nothing in her manner indicated that she had been schooled to observe a cold and guarded manner toward him. Perhaps she was graver than usual, but sociable and full of conversation. At times her manner was nervous. "I have many things to say to you, many questions to ask you, but cannot remember them now; and a few days hence it will be too late, for I hear you have effected your exchange, and will doubtless at once set out for India." While saying this her hands were busy with the books and sketches on the table. But she did not improve the arrangement of them. "I have now an opportunity of exchanging into a regi- ment in India," said Ormond; "and yet I loiter here. Can you doubt what chains me to this spot?" Constance started, and colored deeply. When he took her hand she did not struggle to withdraw it from his grasp. "I dare not ask you to go with me," said Ormond.   SAINT CREILLA.        19T "But I will leave Malta with a joyous heart if you will tell me that I may return two years hence and claim you as 1my owD." Constance covered her face with the hand that was free, and rested her head on the table. Two yearsl Should she look forward to her father's death within that time? or to leaving him when more dependent upon her than he now was? She trembled violently front the struggle within her. Then starting up suddenly and freeing her hand from Ormond's grasp, she exclaimed, "My father I my poor father I I must never leave him!" "God forbid that I should mar your father's happi- ness," said Ormond, earnestly. "But daughters leave their fathers, and it is natural that they should." "He has sacrificed everything for me: health, strength, years of domestic happiness. My mother left him to me, and I am his sole comfort and support." He may be willing to make thie sacrifice," suggested Ormond. ' No!"Constnnce exclaimed. " lie has made too many sacrifices already. They have made him the wreck he is. He shall not be asked to mlake more. No; you are young, prosperous, energetic. The world lies before you full of high promise. I will not desert him in his need." Ormond was about to speak; but she dared not trust herself to listen. She stopped her ears and sprang to- ward the door, Turning there for a moment, she said, "God protect you, Captain Ormond. May you prosper in all things." Then Phe ran up-stairs and locked herself in her chamber. A fast-sailing ship had just touched at Valetta on her way to Alexandria. Ormond went on board and inquired when she would sail. "The day after to-morrow," was the answer. But he would not take his passage. lie would  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7202-00000100"/> 198        SAINT CECILIA. make one trial more. He sought Colonel Guilford, and at length espied him in the street. When the colonel saw him he seemed to hesitate for a moment. In truth he surmised why Orimond sought him, and had not made up his mind what to say to him. So he turned toward the barracks in which his own regiment was quartered. Ormond followed him; but the adjutant and another officer joined the colonel, and they were soon in earnest conference. Ormond was not in a humor to brook delay. Walking up to the group, he said,." Colonel Guilford, I am seeking an opportunity to speak to you." Colonel Guilford looked on the ground with an air at once thoughtful and sad; then raising his head, an- swered, "We are occupied with regimental business. You must find another time." "Another time then, sir," said Ormond, and, bowing to the group, he turned away. How anxiously had the father watched the daughter for the last few days! How much did he long to see into her heart! Had she given it irredeemably to Ormond? The more he considered Ormond's character and probable career, and how short a career it was likely to be, the more he considered his merits, which; by exaggeration, had become defects, the worse appeared Constance's pros- pect of happiness in a union with him.. Her father would not question her, yet he shunned every explanation with Oriond until he had some indication that Constance's heart had been completely won by him. The next day Ormond called at an hour when he felt sure of finding Colonel Guilford at home. He was out. Ormond walked in and asked to see Miss Guilford. Con- stance was in her chamber busily occupied. But for this occupation, her resolution not to see him might have failed her. But she was busy packing up the books and en-   SAINT CECILIA.        199 gravings he had sent her, and many tears fell over this painful task. She could not compose herself sufficiently to see him;i and when her maid knocked at the locked door Constance opened it wide enough to admit the mes- sage, but not the messenger, and sent her down to express' her regret that she was too unwell to see him. Unwell? When was she ever unwell before? Ormond left the house with a bosom racked by more bitter and painful feelings than he had ever yet suffered. He was mortified, but mortification formed but a small part of that which now distressed him. That day he got leave to set out for India at once, and took passage in the ship which would sail the next morn- ing. On returning to his quarters he found a package and a note. lie tore the latter open. "DEAR CAPTAIN ORMOND: "I send back the engravings and books you lent me-all except one. Pardon my keeping your Dante. You know I have not finished it. May God protect and prosper you through life. Yours, "CONSTANCE GUILFORD." "Will no copy of Dahte serve her but mine?" said Ormond in a softened tone. A flush of joy lighted up his stern lip and saddened brow. He kissed the words her hand had traced, and, folding up the precious note, put it carefully away.  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7202-00000101"/> 200        SAINT CECILIA. CHAPTER XVII. "I stand upon the sea-beach now, and think; Mine arms thus, and mine hair blown by the wind, Wild as that desert. Strive to make me look Like sorrow's monument; and the trees about me, Let them be dry and leafless; let the rocks Groan with continual surges; and behind me Make all a desolation!"--TRK MAID'S TRAGEDY. As the first rays of the sun streamed into her chamber window, Constance awoke from  the short and uneasy slumnbers into which she had sunk after a second wakeful night. The trials of yesterday rushed back upon her, and she covered her face with her hands to shut out the world and its sorrows. But presently she sprang from her bed and hastened to the window. From that elevation much of the town, of the fortifications, of the great harbor, and a part of the sea beyond it were spread out before her. In the dewy atmosphere of the early morning every object lay distinctly in view, except where the horizontal rays of the sun, glancing over the undulating waters, threw a broad band of light across the sea and into the mouth of the harbor, dazzling her eyes. She stood gazing out and wondering how the whole face of nature, by land and water, could look so bright and cheerful, as if nothing had happened; and the joyous rays of the sun, dancing on the waters, seemed to mock her grief. Soon an object on the edge of this bright band of light caught her eye. It became gradually distinct, and a ship, already well out at sea, with every sail set to caclb the southern breeze, laden with the heats of torrid Africa.

She watched it long and sadly while running its swift course toward the Levant-the hull, then te lower sathen t he n top sail hn s, a nd top-gallant sails successively sank below the horizon. What was the bright sun, and the cloudless sky, and the sparkling waters, and dark-green foliage of the orange grove spangled over with starry white blossoms, loading the fresh morning air with sweet perfume-what were they all to her? Malta was but a barren rock under a gloomy heaven; and all the bright memories of the past only rendered the present bitter hour more sad, hopeless, sickening. She sank down on a scat and wept bitterly. Presently she raised her head and gazed despondently around the room. Her eye fell on the volume of Dante lying on the table near her. She took it up, gazed sadly on it; then letting it fall upon the table, strode up and down the room, with her hands convulsively clasped, while she exclaimed, "Dante and Beatrice I Dante and Beatrice I The human heart is the same now as then. He, indeed, may forget me. Amid the stirring- scenes of an ambitious and adventurous life, he may forget. But I can never cease to pray for him!" She started on hearing her father's step as he passed her door. It must be later than she thought it. Usually she was down-stairs before him. She dressed herself speedily, but carefully. No sign of a hasty toilet should betray the restless night or the sorrows of the morning. She could not hide the paleness of her cheek, but strove to assume a composed, if not cheerful demeanfor, and went down to breakfast. Her father bade her good-morning without looking at her. But while, with an affectation of alertness, she busied herself in preparing the tea, and then played with her knife and fork under pretence of eating, she was aware that he watched her furtively but closely.  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7202-00000102"/> 202        SAINT CECILIA.  He now and then made some remark by way of conversa- tion, and she strove to answer him in an easy tone; but her voice was husky and tremulous; and it was a great relief to her when this mockery of a meal was over. How much she longed to be alone I But this poor- com- fort was denied her. Her father, complaining of lassitude and the heat of the weather, took his seat in the room in which she usually passed the morning, the largest and coolest in the house. He evidently desired her company, and she would not desert him. Here he employed him- self in conning over the last batch of papers from England; and as he read, he found, or made, occasion to address some remark to her, on topics which the papers suggested to him. But how dull and faded were these topics to her ear! She found it a hard task to recall her wandering thoughts and find appropriate answers. He spoke with seeming interest of persons and events in England. But Constance's heart was not in England, and she could not fix her thoughts there. It was galling to know that he was watching her anxiously, and striving to divert her mind from the incidents of the last few months, and from him who of late had been so often her companion. The effort at composure of voice and manner was mad- dening to her. She must find, or seem to find, an occupa- tion for her hands, her eyes, her thoughts. Her eve wandered round the room. A book would not serve the purpose. She could not be still enough even to pretend to read. Her eye fell upon her portfolio. Seizing on it, she seated herself at a table at a distance from her father, and began to turn over the drawings slowly, seeming to dwell upon themn with an absorbing interest which gave an excuse for silence. But how feigned was that interest I How faded were the feelings with which she had worked at them, now that she strove to recall them! The same   SAINT CECILIA.        203 dull, leaden tint overspread them all. Nor did they fail to excite more acute emotions. Of her later drawings, how manir were associated with the presence, the suggLes- tions, the admiration of one whom she could never forget, yet dared not hope to see again She turned to earlier' efforts. They brought .back to memory the inmates of Latimer Lodge. This portrait of a lovely but simple and confiding girl, older than herself, and who had left school before her-she was a woman now. Had she too dis- covered that she had a heart? -Had she too learned the same lesson of disappointment? Had insuperable obstacles separatcd her from some mock Ormond whom her imagiination h ad, perhaps, clothed with all the high qualities and graces of the true man? She put it sadly by with a feeling of sympathy for the imaginary sorrows which she had created. She took up a skctch-bo6oklwhich had been left in the portfolio, and opening it, came to a drawing which was germane to her present mood-the old fisherman, whose air of hopeless despondency had equally impressed Or- mond and herself. She had caught the true expression she sought to give; and he was the personification of that hopeless desolation emblematic of her own feelings and fate. On this subject she could work. Here she could represent the emotions within her to the eye. She could tell the tale of her own heart without betraying her secret. She rose from her seat with a, suddenness that startled her father. Drawing out a prepared canvas, already stretched upon thefiame, she placed it on her easel; then, laying the sketch before her, she fell to work. Never be- f6re had she appeared so completely engrossed by her occu- pation. Never before had her hand been so busy or so skilful. Never before had she paused in deeper thought, taxing her imagination for some adjunct, to express the sentiments  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7202-00000103"/> 204 *      SAINT CECILIA. more fully, and heighten the effect. Her father furtively watched her progress, and muttered to himself, "Work, work I In anxiety, in disappointment, in sorrow; there is no lethean draught like hearty, earnest work. Happy are they who still retain, under all their trials, the energy to work!" And Constance's energy did not prove spasmodic. Many hours on that day, and on others following it, she wrought sedulously. A double portion of her artistic enthusiasm seemed to have fallen upon her. If her im- pulse was not joyous, it was enduring and intense. The painting, not hastily but thoughtfully and laboriously finished, was at last complete. She sat down at due dis- tance from it with a ealm although saddened brow. The old fisherman, bowed down by years and unprofita- ble toil, clothed in scanty and ragged garments, leaned against his wreck of a boat, contemplating with woeful countenance the ruin of his last hope. The fragment of the mast lay across the gunwale, with the sail hanging from it in tatters; the broken oar, and torn and empty net lay at his feet. No ray of hope cast a light upon the scene before him. The gloom of despair gleamed from his leaden eye. Never again would he, like the Tyrian fish- erman, "burn incense to his drag." He had made his last venture; he had dragged his last net, and had brought ashore only ruin. The surf, having vented its fury, now played lazily and contemptuously along the keel of its victim; and the storm, having done its work here, now lowered over the tempest-driven ship on the distant waters beyond the projecting headland in the background. The young artist looked at her picture sadly but steadily. Her work, the silent exponent of her feelings, had calmed her. She faced the sorrow within with a brave, resigned, but unforgetting heart. She was a girl no longer. She   SAINT CECILIA.        205 would endure sorrow, stifle regret, and seek duties; and, gazing on her father's anxious, pallid face and wasted form, she saw her field of duty lying immediately before her. When she rose and left the room her father took the seat she had just left, and gazed long and sadly on the picture. A knowledge of the circumstances under which it had been conceived and executed, was the key which opened to him the full meaning of every line and shade before him. "My poor child!" he at length sighed. "Here I can read your heart. God grant that it may have vented some portion of its sorrows in this mirrored image of that which is hidden in your bosom.-" From this time Constance habitually sat in the same room with her father, who was seldom absent from home but on brief periods of duty. She laid aside the books which had lately occupied a portion of her time, and read others which brought no painful associations with them. Dante was hidden away, safely kept, but never looked into. 'She worked assiduously with her pencil, appealing to her father's taste and judgment in the choice of subjects, and the mode of treating them ; encouraging him to watch her progress and criticise the results. She was resolved that he should have the full benefit of the sacrifice she had made. Shunning solitude and meditations on which the past would intrude, she was her father's companion not only within doors, but on the short rides and walks the heat of summer permitted. Shrinking, as she did, from society, the gentlemen lwho came to the house seldom saw her, and never alone. Thus the summer passed slowly, but not idly, toward its end. Constance's industry as an artist had been a refuge from the painful memories which haunted every 18  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7202-00000104"/> 206        SAINT CECILIA. unemployed hour. H-er father gazed with admiration on the productions of her pencil, perhaps greatly overrating their merits. IIc longed to give her an opportunity of cultivating her powers in the best school. 13ut he was shocked at the change which a few months had made in her looks. Her pale cheek, her dull eye, her flagging step, -were these the result of too assidluous application in this prostrating climate? He would gladly have believed this. But even Constance's silent and patient endurance could not conceal from him the grief which was gnawing at her heart. He was anxious to take her to Italy, hoping that change of climate, new scenes, and a multitude of objects, in which she had long felt great interest, would divert her thoughts, restore her health, and greatly aid her progress in her artistic pursuits. He felt that his own health was failing more and more, and hoped little from this change of climate. His daugh- ter's future condition was a cause of intense anxiety to him. Constance would soon be without the protection of the parent for whom she had sacrificed an attachment which she could neither forget nor conceal. Colonel Guil- ford now reproached himself with having shunned that last interview which Ormond had eagerly sought. Per- haps, when in his doubt and anxiety he had avoided Ormond, he had wrecked the happiness of two true and fond hearts. In case of his own death, what friend had Constance to look to? Resolutely ignoring all claim on his own relatives, he felt bound to open a correspondence with Mrs. Beresford, the nearest kinswoman of his wife. He now wrote to her, stating how slender was his tenure of life, and bespeaking her protection for Constance in case of his death. No answer to this letter ever reached his hand. Obtaining leave of absence late in autumn, Colonel   SAIN3T CECIL L4.       207 Guilford sailed with his daughter to Naples; and after spending several weeks in that vicinity they went on to pass the winter itr Rome. Constance was now in the midst of those objebts which, through the zealous instruc- tions and discourses of Herr Rhodoman, had long excited her curiosity and inflamed her imlagination. She was by nature full of enthusiasm, strong impulses, and ambitious aimus; and she' was anxious so to fill her hours as to shut out the painful past. She was in pursuit of excite- ment, and she found it; for she was not passively receiving impressions, but laboriously grappling with the new ideas which crowded upon her. While yet in Naples, Colonel Guilford had been delighted at the first decided indication Constance exhibited of a revival of that free and joyous spirit which had once char- acterized her. Latterly she had not found heart to sing; but suddenly her love of music returned in full force. During their stay in Naples they went often to the theatre of San Carlo, and the impression there made on Constance was indicated by the frequent snatches of melody which, echoing through her memory, she involuntarily poured forth from her lips. Yet it was not the music of the opera which most attracted her. In Rome she became a fiequent attendant at the Sistine Chapel, and other churches where the best sacred music was to be heard; and it was the solemn and devout strains which fascinated her ear and thrilled through her heart. Yet delighted as she was she proved a severe critic; and the lively and volup- tuous harmony at times heard there offended her as inap- propriate, to the worship of God; while the imposing but sensuous ceremonial of the Romish Church, here witnessed in its highest grandeur, at once gratified her artistic tastes and offended her convictions as to the pure and simple rites suitable to Christian worship. She became, too,  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7202-00000105"/> 208        SA IJT CEC'ILIA. more than ever impressed with the evil of that radical error, which, under the pretence of aiding the penitent and humbled Christian, has raised so many barriers be- tween the sinner and his Saviour. Ambng the multitude of strangers in Rome were a crowd of English. But Colonel Guilford and his daughter studiously avoided them. Most of these families lived in a style far above that which it suited Colonel Guilford to maintain; and Constance's object was not society but art. It was with the aim of the laborious artist, not of the, idling amateur, that she frequented each attractive point in or near Rome. She did not paint; she drew but little except sketches to aid the memory; but she studied the 'works of the great masters with an enthusiastic but not slavish eye, and by frequent excursions into the country around, mlade herself familiar with the scenes, the climate, and the natural objects which had excited the genius and moulded the conceptions of Italian artists. And she felt more grateful than ever to Iierr Rhodomn, for the train- ing he had given her, which had prepared hler to make the most of the opportunities she now enjoyed. Some of her time was given to the study of the lan- guage, but more to music. She took lessons from the best teacher of vocal music in Rome. Hle was delighted at the sweetness, power, and flexibility of her voice, and took ,great interest in her progress. He had been an eminent opera singer until an accident resulting in laimeness drove him from the stage and made him, sorely against his will, take refuge in the church as a leader of the choir. He still retained a strong predilection for the style of music  best suited to his original occupation. Seeing the humble style in which Colonel Guilford lived compared with the many wealthy Englishmen visiting Rome, and comparing his apparently narrow means with the prompt payment   SAITT' CECILIA.        209 of the large fees he himself demanded for his instructions, the musician was convinced that the Englishman's object was to educate his daughter as a professional singer, and that English pride alone prevented their confessing that she was destined for the stage. 'Under this impression the professor of music proceeded to train his pupil. No one was more aware than he was of the intimate connection, in speech, and yet more in song, between the exertion and effects of the voice and tihe postures and gestures of the body. Constance's grace and enthusiasm made this conspicuous in her; and her teacher encouraged her to yield to those natural impulses, which give a visible as well as vocal expression to the emotions she felt and would express in song. Stimulated by his precepts, which were founded in nature, for such action is the natural complement and aid to the voice, Constance yielded readily to her natural impulses, and became, unawares, an actress while learning to sing. Zeal, industry, and the gifts of nature produced in her the best results; and her instructor doubted not that he would soon be able to boast of a new and distinguished prima donna among his pupils. An occasional excursion into the adjacent country broke the monotony of this studious life. One of these was the more deeply impressed on Constance's memory from her almost meeting with I andventure in it. Ranging farther than usual, they had on the second day penetrated into the mountain region on the route between Rome and Aquila. They had stopped on a level spot beside the road to breathe the,mules, exhausted in dragging the car- riage up the steep ascent. Charmed with the wild scene before her, Constance had taken out her sketch-book, and was busy with her pencil; while Colonel Guilford, cx- hausted with fatigue, stretched himself off in the carriage 18*  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7202-00000106"/> 210        SAINT CECILIA. and composed himself to sleep. Soon two mules were seen descending the pass before them, driven by a tall peasant. As he drew near, Constance saw that he was a carbonaro, not one. of the secret political society so called, but a genuine charcoal-burner. He was a man of huge stature and ruffianly look, and as his mules stopped to drink at a rill which crossed the road some yard.; above the carriage, he eyed each of the party keenly, and loitered for a time; then striking his mules with his heavy, iron- shod staff, he hurried them down the pass. This man evidently belonged to the lowest and most brutal class of the people. But there was something so striking in his whole aspect that, but for his ruffianly air, Constance would have bribed him to stand for a model while she secured his portrait for future use. He had passed on, and Constance had made good progress in her landscape, when she saw him reascending the pass without his mules. And now both Constance and the vetturo watched him with observant eyes, while he only glanced furtively at them and passed by. Ere half an hour had elapsed, other mules vere .seen coming down the mountain road. They were driven by three men, and the vetturo started and turned pale when he discovered that one of them was their tall acquaintance with the forbidding face, who had already passed them twice. Constance was gazing on the group of mules and their wild-looking drivers, as they came toward her, and thinking how she could best introduce them into her land- scape, when an exclamation from the vetturo called her attention to him. The utmost alarm was stamped on his face, while he exclaimed, "Wake your father, signora! Do not trust these men!"Constance saw no cause for uneasiness. They had met with many of these coal- burners. Poverty-stricken and depressed while following   SAINT CECILIA.        2" a calling that yielded but small gains, they had always passed peaceably and humbly by their party. But terror is catching, and she rose and hastened to the carriage. Her father was asleep, and looked so pale, and worn out by fatigue, that she was reluctant to rouse him. The danger perhaps existed only in the imagination of a timid youth. Yet she drew out her father's pistol-case, and returning to her seat, placed it by her. By this time the party were within fifteen paces, and as the mules stopped to drink at the rill, the men drew together as if in council. They stood looking at Constance and the carriage by turns. The tall man in front, with a stern and resolute air, the others a little behind him, one on each side, seemed to hesitate at something their huge companion was urging upon them. Constance seeing the velluro standing behind his mules, with a pale face, but a long knife grasped, firmly in his hand, now threw open the pistol-case, and cocking the pistols, ostentatiously laid one on each side of her. Then opening her sketch-book, she, with a somewhat un- steady hand, affected to sketch the group before her. Tile sight of the pistols and her apparent coolness over- awed two of the party. They shrank back, and one of them, calling to the mules, set them in motion. While they began to descend the, road, the huge ruffian, after glancing at the vetturo, fixed his eyes on Constance, grasped his staff more fiercely, and seemed loath to abandon his hope of plunder. But seeing Constance's hand glide stealthily t) a pistol and seize it firmly, while her eye never left him, and hearing the retreating steps of his comrades, he turned off, exclaiming, "Poltroni Poltroni!" and with a sulky air, but long strides, hastened after them.  It was not until he was gone that Constance felt the full sense of alarm. But now that the danger was over she rose, trembling in every limb, nervously grasping a  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7202-00000107"/> 212       SAINT CECILIA. pistol in each hand, and wondering at the self-possession she had shown. The triumphant shout of the vetturo, who now stepped for'ward flourishing his long knife, woke Colonel Guilford. Looking' out from- the carriage he saw his daughter's agitation and her armed hands, and the extravagant gestures of the youth. Springing out of the carriage with much of his old military promptitude, lhe asked what alarmed them. The vetturo exclaimed, "We  would all have been robbed and murdered but for your pistols, my knife, and the siguora's courage i"And, still greatly excited, he fiercely brandished his weapon. "Robbed and murdered by three wretched charcoal- burners!' said Colonel Guilford, looking contemptuously at the retreating carbonari. "But one of them is truly a stalwart fellow, and might be dangerous if his daring equalled his strength." A few words from Constance explained the cause of alarm. Her father looked grave, and said,. "Truly, you were not too hasty in showing your pistols; but why did you not wake me? It is almost a pity you are a girl, Con- stance: you would have made a prompt soldier." But as, he took the pistols from her now tremulous hands, he added, "I see that your nerves are somewhat shaken: you would shoot badly just now. By-the-by, it would be well to teach you to shoot. It is not considered a neces- sary accomplishment for a lady, but it might be useful here, and elsewhere, on emergencies." Accordingly, on this and future excursions, Constance was taught to load and fire, and her father was delighted at the steadiness of hand and accuracy of aim she, soon acquired. Meanwhile the winter had passed away; and, on the return of hot weather, the crowd of strangers began to leave Rome. As Colonel Guilford's furlough was drawing   SAINT CECILIA.        213 to a close, he took Constance on a tour through the more northern parts of Italy. After several weeks thus de- lightfully spent, they were forced to return to Malta at the most inauspicious season of the year. Colonel Guilford and his daughter were again settled in their old quarters, with which so many sad recollections were associated. They lived as retired a life as was coml- patible with. his duties. His ill health, the heat of the weather, and the little interest they now took in barren Malta, deterred them from continuing their excursions about an island which they bad so well explored. The orange-trees were again in blossom, and Colonel Guilford again took his promenades under their shade. But to Constance the blossoms had lost their perfume. 'It was always with reluctance, and only to accompany her father, that she ever put her foot on that walk. How often had Ormond shared these promenades! Why, there was not a tree in that long row which was not inseparably asso- elated with some reflection or sentiment uttered by him, some look or gesture of his pictured to her eye. Some little incident in her intercourse with him was forever in- truding upon her. There she had first seen him, and there he was ever reappearing to her. She could not wish to forget him, yet it was painful to have his image thus vividly thrust back upon her. Constance wished to steel herself against the past, and happily the busy winter spent in Italy had done much to break the thread of her feelings and her thoughts. It had stimulated her ambition, it had enlarged- her range of thought, it had taught her nianv a lesson in art, and sug- gested many a conception, to some of which she hastened to give expression in a permanent form. She worked earnestly and cheerfully under her father's eye; and their late travels furnished them with abundant topics, of interest  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7202-00000108"/> 214        SAINT CECILIA. to them both. No effort was now necessary, as it once was, to enable Constance to sustain a forced conversation, in order to conceal her own painful thoughts. Some months had been thus profitably, almost happily, spent, and Constance, availing herself of the long sumlmer days, was collecting a little gallery of her own productions, of which she was not a little proud, while her father was divided between his extravagant admiration of her works and his anxiety at the growing paleness of the artist's cheek, when her industry in this pursuit was suddenly in- terrupted. One morning Colonel Guilford returned fronm duty in a fever. The regimental surgeon was called in. He pronounced his colonel's health to be feeble, but that there was nothing alarming in this particular attack. But the fever continued some days, with much stupor at times, baffling the skill of the surgeon and the professional brother he had called to his assistance. Late at night Constance was Iwatching by her father's bedside, when she perceived that the fever had left him. Hie slept for an hour or two; then waking suddenly, as if roused by some exciting dream, he gazed eagerly at her. Alarmed at his excitement, the nore so as his weakness was evident, she eagerly pressed a stimulating potion on him. He rejected it, and seemed strangely agitated. Suddenly, with a strong effort, he seized her hand and exclaimed, hoarsely, "My daughter I my daughter I leave you in this cold, hard world alone, utterly alone!" Constance staggered as the fatal truth flashed upon her. But eager to calm his agitation, she fell on her knees beside him, exclaiming, A"Not alone, father: my God will be with nle!"A gleam of comfort shot over his face, and lingered there. But he spoke not again. His breathing grew more labored, his hand grew colder, and soon relaxed its grasp in death.   SAINT CECILIA.        215 Manifold and mysterious are the channels by which the Holy Spirit makes his way into the heart. From child- hood Constance had been familiar with devout emotions; for the teachings and example of her mother had not been lost upon her. But now the words of comfort, uttered to soothe the ear of her dying father, sank from her lips into her own, heart, bearing with them a far deeper faith than they ever before conveyed. After the first burst of her grief she could again repeat them, with the assurance that she uttered, not merely an intellectual conception, but a vital truth clung to by her heart. Often in hours of trial yet to come, she again drew comfort and courage from the conviction-"I am not alone. My God is still with me!" CHAPTER XVIII. "'Tis ever thus; those shadows we call friends Attend us through the sunshine of success, To vanish in adversity's dark hour."-OLD PLAY. IMMEDIATELY after the funeral, the wife of Brigadier- General P---  took Constance home with her. But she did not remain there long. In the midst of her grief and desolation, Constance was not insensible to the kindness of the comparative strangers who crowded around her. But the great griefs of her life were all associated with Malta; Her strongest impulse was to leave it as soon as possible. Nor was there much to delay her. Sending for the skilful workman in marble (Malta abounds in such) who had erected the monument over her mother's grave, she arranged with him that a similar one should be placed I  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7202-00000109"/> 216       SAINT CECILIA. by its side over her father's body. The house Colonel Guilford had occupied was given up, the furniture sold, and Constance was ready to accompany the wives of two officers about to sail for England. These ladies were almost strangers to her, and the maid she took with her was an Englishwoman who had been in her service only since her return from Italy. To get away from  Malta had lately engrossed her thoughts, and as yet she had formed no very definite plan for the future. The wife of the brigadier, whose house had been her refuge for the last few days, knowing Colonel Guilford's high connections, did not dream that Constance, when once again in England, could be at a loss for a home. When at sea, and after she had taken, with tearful eyes, her last sad look at the cliffs on the western coast of Malta as they sank below the horizon, this question as to her future home forced itself on Constance's thoughts; and this was a frequent subject of meditation during the voyage. Her very approach to her native land made her feel her solitude the more. The feeling engendered was not alarm but desolation. She remembered how carefully her father, and her mother, too, had avoided all reference to his family,-and especially to his brother, Lord Faringdon, who was her nearest kinsman now. She doubted not that they had good cause for this silence, and she resolved to keep out of his way, and shun all communication with him. Her mother's kindred were more remote. And Mrs. Beresford, known to her only by name, was the only one so nearly allied in blood to her that could be expected to take a decided interest in her young kinswoman. Mrs. Beresford might be a worldly woman, proud and ostenta- tious; for the little that Constance had heard of her savored of these traits. But she could hardly refuse the guardianship of a girl, one of her nearest relatives, who   SAINT CECILIA.        217 would be no incumbrance on her, for she would not be dependent on her bounty. For Constance knew that her father's success in India, and his economy for the last six or seven years had accumulated a fund still profitably employed there through the agency of a banking-house in Calcutta. This made a provision for her which raised her far above want. Constance looked anxiously forward to her first meeting with Mrs. Beresford, with many speculations as to where she would find her, and what kind of person she would prove when found. Meanwhile, Constance began to feel that, for a girl of her social rank, her position was more than iawkward, and she resolved that on reaching London she would at once put herself under the care of her father's solicitors, Riddell &amp; Son, until she could communicate with her kinswoman. On'rcaching-Portsmouth she accoim- panied one of the ladies, with whom she had sailed from Malta, and who, passing through London on her way northward, promised to stop there long enough to place Constance in a genteel boarding-house. With many kind wishes hurriedly uttered, her com- panion left her there, hastening on to kindred and friends, and the home of her youth, while Constance, amid the mil- lions of London, turned away from the strangers around her to gaze in the face of her maid, the only face she had ever seen before, -and found no comfort there. This woman, a very hireling-, had won no confidence in her short term of service. Constance felt an instinctive dis- trust of her, and resolved to get rid of her on the earliest opportunity. "Where are the solicitors, Messrs. Riddell &amp; Son?" was Constance's first inquiry on finding herself in her lodgings and her fellow-traveller gone. She got a directory and found their names and place of business. It was late in  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7202-00000110"/> 218        SAINT CECILIA. the day, so she sent a note to their chambers, saying that she would call on them in the morning. It was not until the next morning that the Messrs. Rid- dell received this note, and it then caused no little alterca- tion between father and son, eacli desiring that the other should hold the interview with Miss Guilford. The son proved the more stubborn; and, when the appointed hour drew near, he withdrew to his own den, while his father prepared, much against his will, for the interview with his orphan client. His table ;was already covered with bun. dles of documents. He now placed a copy of the ' Times" newspaper and a glass of water carefully within reach. Then, opening a musty parchment with faded ink and old seals, took his seat with the air of a man completely abstracted by his occupation, and overwhelmed by the demands upon his time. Constance knew nothing of business, and little of her father's affairs. She was not aware that Messrs. Riddell were the solicitors and agents of the bankers, McCauley &amp; Reid, of Calcutta; and that it was through this connec. tion that her father had fallen as a client into their hands. At the appointed hour she arrived in a hackney-conch ac. companied by her maid. The clerk, properly schooled for the occasion, offered her a seat in the anteroom. Both members of the firm, he was sorry to say, were busy, ex- ceedingly busy; but, after awhile, Mr. Riddell, Senior, could see her for a few minutes, only for a few minutes. Constance stared at this reception, and eyed the young man so haughtily that she put him quite out of countenance. She was not the kind of person he had expected to see. Withdrawing her eyes from him she cast them thought- fuilly on the floor, and said to herself, "My affairs, I see, are not quite so important as I imagined them.' So she took a seat and prepared to wait the leisure of this very   SANT CE CILIA.        219 busy man. The clerk, after fidgeting at his desk for awhile, went into the inner room, closing the door after him. Presently he opened the door and asked Miss Guilford to walk in. Constance entered and found the solicitor, a. grave, bald man of sixty, with a hard, cautious face, still so much en- grossed with his musty parchment that he seemed unaware of her presence. But, at a word from the clerk as he went out, the solicitor looked up, bowed, and pointed to a chair near the table. He saw a tall young woman dressed in deep mourning, but did not look her steadily in the face. When Constance had taken the seat, he rested his head on one hand in the posture of a listener, without looking at her, as if expecting her to open the conference. Constance was chilled by his cold formality. She was accustomed to see a certain impression produced by her presence; and had expected that some interest at least wxould be exhibited in herself and her affairs. She felt a sickening sensation. But drawing a deep breath she looked fixedly at him, and said, "You were the solicitor  of my late father, Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Guilford?" "We have acted as such for some years," he answered, with a bow. T"You are aware that he had funds in the hands of McCauley &amp; Reid, of Calcutta?" "More than eight thousand pounds," said Mr. Riddell. "I am Colonel Guilford's. daughter,-his only child," she continued. "I am a minor, and know that, in law, I cannot act for myself. But you can instruct me what steps to take in order to procure a maintenance, during my minority, out of thatl fulld." '"We could do so doubtless, and would be happy to afford you professional aid," he said; "but, unfortu- nately-   &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7202-00000111"/> 220        SAINT CECILIA. "Unfortunately what?" asked Constance. "The firm of McCauley &amp; Reid has failed." "Failed!"Constance faltered. "Failed, utterly 1" said Mr. Riddell. His hand glided toward the glass of water on the table, and for the first time he looked his client full in the face. Constance indeed turned pale. She was greatly shocked; but she was not overcome. Perhaps she did not recog- nize the completeness of the ruin which had fallen upon her. Until now money had little occupied her thoughts. The solicitor saw that the glass of water would not be needed. But as she sat silent, looking at him, not seeing him, but striving to collect her thoughts, he imagined that she doubted the truth of his statement. So he took up the copy of the "Times," ten days old, and pointing out a particular paragraph, requsted her to read it. Had he shown any sympathy for her it is likely that she would have been moved to tears. - Greater, far greater griefs she had known; yet she could not but recognize this as no small misfortune. But looking in his cold, hard face, she resolved that he should never see the loss of money wring a tear from her. With a great effort she suppressed the tremor of her hand as she took the paper, and with forced calmness read the passage he had pointed out. From this she learned that the house of McCauley &amp; Reid, having embarked in hazardous undertakings beyond its means, had now fallen with a cash, cr rushing many in its ruins. Constance shut her eyes for a moment, and pressed her hand against her brow. Presently raising her head, she calmly asked, "Will nothing, then, be saved?" "Nothing, I fear," said he. "Colonel Guilford trusted them implicitly, and they seem to have put him on the footing of a partner; so that all he had will gd into the   SAINT CLCILIA.        221 assets. Other creditors may save something, but your loss will be total."  Constance bowed her head. She would not trust her voice. Then, after sitting still for a moment to steady her nerves and compose her countenance, she rose, and said firmly, "Then I suppose we can do nothing in this l matter." The attorney was not quite as hard a man as he affected to be. He had been anxious to get rid of a ruined client, in the shape of a young lady who might imagine that she had claims upon him. As hie looked on Constance, a change came over his face, wlich made him quite another man. lie rose respectfully, and said, in a kindly tone, "I am afraid we cail save nothing from the. wreck of McCauley &amp; Reid. But, under these distressing circurn- stances, I am anxious to serve you." He )paused thought- fully for a moment. When he becamle Colonel Guilford's solicitor he had taken pains to inform himself as to so much of his client's personal and family history as was accessible to him. "There is one obvious resource left to vou, Miss Guilford. Lord Faringdon is your father's brother. Whatever mnay have sown dissension between them, you are his niece, ald lie must provide for you. He is a nobleman, well known, of large fortune, prominent in public life. He dare not sacrifice the good opinion the world has of him by neglecting to provide for his destitute orphan niece. I do not know," added the cautious attorney, after taking a more minulte survey, than he had yet done, of Constance, from head to foot, and then letting his eyes dwell upon her face, "I lo not know that your uncle will take you into his family and place you alongside of his daughters. Lady Faringdon is said to be a proud yet politic woman, and might not consent to that. But Lord Faringdon will doubtless provide for you n lcd find you a  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7202-00000112"/> 222       SAINT CECILIA. home. He will not dream of including you in a family quarrel in which you had no part, for it occurred long be- fore you were born."- Seeing that Constance kept silence, he continued: "You may be reluctant to address him yourself. Then suffer me to apply to him for you, rather as your late father's agent than your own; and I promise you that all the embarrassment of your position will vanish." And he paused for an answer. "I do not know Lord Faringdon," said Constance, firmly; ' I wish to hear no ill of him. But I knew my father. He may at times have been hasty, but never unjust. I never heard him namt e his brother. And I will not for one moment doubt that he had good cause for twenty, perhaps thirty years of alienation. I shall seek elsewhere for a friend!"And bowing to him, she turned to leave the room. But the solicitor followed her almost eagerly. "Miss Guilford, it is my duty to advise; your right to accept or reject that advice. Do not reject it hastily. In this case I feel bound to press it upon you. Take an old man's counsel," he said, almost tenderly. "You are in a strange position; you are of high birth, you are very young, yet you are alone in the world,-without resources, without a protector; you are--" lere he paused. It struck him that it was not exactly professional to tell his client that she was an uncommonly handsnome young woman. "There are a thousand reasons why you should find a guardian without loss of time." Constance was moved by his change of manner and his earnest tone. Two tear-drops started into her eyes while she answered him: "You mean this in kindness, and I thank you for it. But remember, I have applied to youl as a professional man. Without my consent you have no right to breathe my name to Lord Faringdon, or call his ZDi   SAINT CECILIA.        223 attention to my affairs. Good-morning, sir." And she passed out of the room. The attorney stood gazing at the open door of the ante- room for some moments after she had passed through it. At length he muttered, "At her age the law allows her to choose her own guardian,-and I suppose the law does right." Comforting himself with this sound leal reflec- tion, he returned to his table loaded with bundles of docu- ments. But it was some time before any of them engaged his attention. Other eyes were now on Constance than those of Rid- dell, Senior. The junior partner had refused to conduct the interview with her; yet, being a meddlesome young limb of the law, he had become curious to know what sort of a person ColonelGuilford's orphan daughter was; and was still more curious to learn how she would take the news of the loss of her fortune. Peeping out of his door 1he only saw a tall, graceful figure, clothed in deep mourn- ing, ascending the stairs, followed by a maid-servant. He then waited to hear some commotion ; for it was his conviction that women in trouble always faint or screanm; and it was at his provident suggestion that his fattier had placed the glass of water ready at hand for this-emergency. Some tinie passed, yet there was no commotion over- head; and presently the lady reappeared, coming down. stairs. That young, noble face was pale indeed, but calm; the eyes were bright and steady in their gaze; and she bore herself proudly, as if defying fortune's blows. Riddell, Junior, of plebeian origin, had a great respect for high birth. Short of stature, he had a great admiratior for tall ladies; and here was one who had much else to excite h-is admiration. "A marvellously handsome girl," he muttered to himself. "Doubtless as proud as Lucifer. But she has genuine pluck."  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7202-00000113"/> Riddell, Junior, held his father to be but a plodding old  attorney, but had great faith in his own genius for finesse. As Constance was passing out, he ran his fingers through  his whiskers,-he was very proud of them in spite of their  fiery lue,-and hastened after her. "Riddell, Junior," he said, introducing himself. "The  other memnber of the firm. Dreadfully distressed at what has happened. Always distrusted McCaulley &amp; Reid. Glad to be of use to Miss Guilford in any way, or at any time. We may wish to communicate with you, so'pray give me your address." Her address! The words chilled her heart. She had none but a boarding-house, where she was not likely to stay many days. "I will write to your firm," she said, without glancing at the young attorney, "when I need advice." Without taking the assisting hand offered her she stepped lightly into the coach, and her maid followed her. "Where shall he drive to?" asked the inquisitive attorney. "To the house where he took me up," Constance answered, bowing to him as the coachman closed the door. He bowed low, but muttered, "Tom Riddell is not so easily beaten."' And, touching the coachman as he was about to mount the box, he whispered, "Five shillings, if you come back when you put down your fare." The man winked one eye cunningly at him, and drove off. But in half an hour he returned, gave the desired in- telligence, and pocketed his fee. Riddell, Junior, now sought a conference with his father, and -learned both how Miss Guilford had received the news of the loss of her fortune, and her positive refusal to allow any application to be made to Lord Faringdon on her account.   SAIN'T C'EUILIA.       225 "She will change her mind," said Riddell, Junior. "I do not think so," said his father, gravely. "What is her address?" asked the son. "I never remembered to inquire!" exclaimed the old mian in a tone of regret. "That was a blunder," said the young man. "We can- not find her, should we chance to want her." And he secretly chuckled at his own small cunning in finding out what he was convinced Constance meant to conceal. He had no definite scheme in his head; but saw a possibility of making the knowledge of her whereabouts useful to himself, and resolved not to lose sight of her. When Constance reached the boarding-house she dis- missed her maid and shut herself up in her chamber. Until now her thoughts liad dwelt little on 4ier pecuniary condition. Her father's economy had accumulated a con- petence for her, and she had relied upon that, without nicely calculating its amount. That was all lost, irre- trievably lost. She now counted over. her slender funds with a feeling of alarm which she had never known before. A week or two in London would leave her penniless. She thought of Mrs. Beresford. She knew very little of her; but with a provision for her own wants, Constance would have frankly applied to her to act as her guardian, and give her at least a temporary home. But to throw herself as a beggar on her bounty! Constance's pride, and what little she knew of Mrs. Beresford, made her shrink from that. She had passed an hour of agitation and perplexity, not without tears, not without prayer that restored her calmness, when her maid came to tell her that it was time to dress for dinner. At first she resolved not to go down to dinner; but on second thoughts she deemed it best to avoid any appearance of singularity, and to learn some- thing of those she was among. 'The few people in the  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7202-00000114"/> 226        SAINT CECILIA. house seemed to be of a better class; yet at table they stared at her more than was consistent with good breeding. The landlady was the widow of an unsuccessful merchant, who had left her nothing but the house sle lived in, and she derived a precarious income from her occupation. Her daughter, a woman of thirty, seemed to be better educated and more shrewd than her mother; and the politeness of both with difficulty concealed the curiosity which Con- stance's youth, beauty, and lonely situation excited in their minds. Constance felt that she must rescue herself from-a false position, and must seek the means of maintaining herself. On returning to her chamber she speedily, but reluctantly, took her resolution. Her life must be one of labor, but it should be labor which a lady need not blush at nor a woman shrink from. By sacrificing the treasured mementos of the past, the few jewels left her by her mother, she could provide for her temporary support. And one respectable home was open to her, however reluctant she might b)e to shelter herself under that roof. One person would gladly receive her, however unwilling she might be to put herself under her care. Latimer Lodge and its mistress was her only refuge. Much as her frank and generous nature shrunk from contact with, and the necessity of watching against, that artful, grasping spirit, she knew that, in the world's eye, she could lut herself under no better guar- dian. She sat down at once and wrote to Mrs. Latimer, stating her orphan condition, her little knowledge of her surviving relatives, and her desire to find at Latimer Lodge, until she became of age, a home in which she could continue the pursuits which had lately occupied her. These, she said, required that she should have an apartment to herself; and, with a dash of worldly caution, suggested by her   SAINT CECILIA.        227 knowledge of Mrs. Latimer, she gave no hint of her loss of fortune. After tea she accepted an invitation from the mother and daughter to sit in their private room. There was evidently much curiosity behind their politeness. Constance could see in their faceb the intention to pump her; and that they expected, from her youth, to find little difficulty in so doing. She was unprepared for, and annoyed at, the prying curiosity she had' met with. What could be the cause of it? After a momnct's reflection she remembered that these people might be useful to her, and she resolved to put them at their ease, by taking them, in a measure, into her confidence. So she began to converse sociably with them. Without making any allusion to her high connections, she let them know that she was the daughter of an officer who had just died; and her tears showed how fresh this loss was in her memory. She told them that she was about  to return to the school where she had been educated, for it was not improbable that she would have to maintain her- self by teaching. "But it is a very expensive school,'7 she added, " and as I lhave little money on hand, I wish to sell some articles of value before leaving London. If one of you could accompany me to-morrow, your knowledge of the town may save me from being cheated." The mother turned over this service to her daughter, as better qualified for it. The latter undertook it eagerly, as it promised to break in upon the monotony of her present life, and take her to places well known to her in more prosperous days. In the morning, Constance looked carefully over her jewelry. The articles were not numerous, and, excepting one, of no great value. This one was a hoop-ring' with five diamonds, given by her father to her mother as the first pledge of his affections, and of his plighted troth.  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7202-00000115"/> 228       S4AINT CECILIA. Constance clung to the associations connected with it. If possible, she would not part with it, and she could only keep it by sacrificing other treasured mementos of the past. She knew Mrs. Latimer too well to go to the Lodge empty-handed. This would be condemning herself to the place of a hard-worked assistant teacher without a salary. She looked' sadly round at the case which contained her paintings, her few finished pictures, the result of so much study and labor. What their market-value was she knew not; but they might make up the deficiency. She would stifle all regrets and part with them. Calling Miss Randall, her host's daughter, into her room, she exhibited all her jewels except the diamond ring, and asked her opinion of their value. Miss Randall ex- amined them with great interest, put on rings, brooches, bracelets, and other articles, and made Constance put them on, and boldly hazarded 'an opinion on the value of each. She then discussed the characters of several jewellers. The great house of Rundell &amp; Bridge was not to be thought of; they would not look at second-hand jewelry. Burton &amp; Co. was a flash house; it was not to be trusted. Mason &amp; Sons, with less pretension, were more trustworthy, and to that house they would go first. Miss Randall hastened to dress herself to advantage; they sent for a hackney- coach, and set out on their expedition, and Constance soon perceived that her companion knew the town well, and enjoyed the excursion. When they entered the shop of Mason &amp; Sons, Con- stance asked to see one of the principals of the house. As soon as she made her object known she saw that the jew- eller looked on buyers and sellers with very different eyes. The complaisant expression faded from his face, and he said, coldly, "We seldom procure articles in our line of business in this way. We will look at them and give you   SAINT CECILIA.        229 an opinion as to their value,-but merely as an accommo- dation to you." He took the case from her with apparent reluctance. , He opened it; but his attention seemed much divided between Constance and her jewels, looking from one to the other repeatedly and in silence, and his face expressed both inquisitiveness and suspicion. At length he said, "There are some pretty things here. These pearls, although not large, are of fine quality, and these little diamonds are of some value'; but the setting is old- fashioned. Allow me to ask your nalme, miss?" Constance drew out a card and laid it before him. "This lady is your companion?" the jeweller asked. "Miss Randall,' said Constance. This lady was ad- miring many handsome articles in the show-cases, but, on hearing her name, she turned and said, "The daughter of Mrs. Randall, of P---Street, No. 73." The glance of suspicion which the jeweller turned from Constance to her companion, and back again to Constance, angered her. Her cheek flushed, and her eye flashed as she gazed haughtily at him. "Designing people do not lose their tempers," was his reflection as he looked down and again examined the articles. "But it is strange that so very youing a lady should be selling her jewels--If you will leave these things with us until to-morrow we will consider their value and make you an offer. But in deal- ing with strangers we always require a reference to some well-known party. Who can you referito?" "A reference to a well-known party?"Constance looked down thoughtfully; then looking up, said, "Messrs. Rid- dell &amp; Son, Solicitors, Chancery Lane." "That will do, nmaam," said the jeweller, bowing. "Wait one moment for a receipt." When they left the jeweller's, Constance asked her com- panion if sle could carry her to the shops of some of the 20  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7202-00000116"/> 230        SAINT CECILIA. chief picture-dealers,-explaining that her object was not only to see pictures, but to ascertain the prices at which they were sold. Miss Randall undertook this readily, for she liked nothing better than lounging in the fashionable parts of the town. She took the lead at these places, and, having self-possession and loquacity, she procured Con- stance an opportunity of examining, without embarrass- ment, many paintings exposed for sale. They saw works, old and new, good, bad, and indifferent. And, what was particularly convenient, most of them had their prices ticketed on them. Following her companion, with note- book and pencil in hand, ConstanceD made many notes more useful to herself than gratifying to the artists or dealers. "A summer tea-party. Thirty guineas. Stiff figures in a Dutch garden. Want of nature throughout. "Cupid and Psyche. Twenty-five guineas. The models must have been the dairymaid and the herdboy. "A shipwrecked mariner. Twenty guineas. Not half as good as my old Maltese fisherman. A village festival. One hundred guineas. Figures and coloring good, but wants unity,-which my ' Vintage' has. "A mountain scene. Forty guineas.

"Protestant family during the massacre of St. Bar- tholomew. Eighty guineas. Well conceived. Not so well executed, yet too good for this company." Such was the tenor of the running commentary Con- stance jotted down while she and her companion spent some hours in the rooms of different picture-dealers. By   SA INT CECILIA.        231 this one may see that Constance did not underrate herself as an artist. To Miss Randall this was a pleasant holiday; but it was a matter of serious business to Constance, who was, moreover, annoyed to find that while much observing she was much observed, and by no one more inquisitively tlan by her companion, who was evidently of a very pry- ing temper. It was a great relief to Constance when she found herself again at thlle boarding-house, and alone in her own room. While she was out, Riddell, Junior, had called at Mrs. RIandall's, and had an interview with Constance's maid. He drew from her all that she knew concerning her mistress, but soon found that she was not in Miss Guilford's con- fidence. Finding, however, that she was a fit agent for his purpose, he told her that Riddell &amp; Son, the solicitors of the late Colonel Guilford, stood in the relation of guar- dians to his daughter, but found her self-willed and hard to control. But as it was their duty to keep themselves in- formed where and how she disposed of herself, he promised the maid a guinea if she would let him know where Miss Guilford went when she left Mrs. Randall's. He gave her his own address, not that of the firm. But this was need. less caution ; for his father, who had his hands full of im- portant professional business, had found his son fit only for small matters of routine. One of his chief duties was to open all letters and answer such as the head of the house need not see Riddell, Junior, had hardly returned to his chambers when he received a note from lMason &amp; Sons, addressed to the firm, inquiring what they knew of Miss C. Guilford, who had offered to sell them jewelry of some value. "iHal my young lady!" he exclaimed. "You begin to feel the shoe pinch." He at once sat down and wrote a short professional note to Mason &amp; Sons.  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7202-00000117"/> "We have been Colonel Guilford's solicitors for years, and since his death his daughter has consulted us in im- portant affairs. She is a minor, but is authorized td dis- pose of articles of mere personal use. "RIDDELL &amp; SON, Solicitors." This note contained a dictum which might have shocked the senior partner's nerves. But it served its purpose with Mason &amp; Sons. Miss Randall had shown herself so prying that Con- stance was averse to taking her further into her confidence. It was with great satisfaction that she saw that lady go out next morning immediately after breakfast. Not having a permanent home, Constance had hitherto limited her efforts in painting to a portable size. She now sent for a hackney-coach, had the case containing her paintings brought down from her chamber, and with her maid by her side and the case filling the front seat, she drove off before Miss Randall came home. She went first to Mason &amp; Sons. But not caring that her maid should be privy to her affairs,-for she distrusted this woman, she scarcely knew why,-she left her in the coach.  Constance found the jeweller ready to purchase. He  had set a price on each article; and Constance accepted his offer, although she thought it very low. When he had paid her, she drew the glove from her left hand, and, taking off the diamond ring, asked its value. The jeweller examined the ring with attention. "A hundred and sixty-seventy-eighty. We have known rings not superior to this sold for two hundred guineas. But," he added, "not that we could afford to give so much for it." "I trust I shall be able to keep it," said Constance, blushing at having asked its worth in money. It had   another value in her eyes. Putting it on again, she bowed and left the shop. She now drove to one of the picture-dealers. She had been much pleased yesterday with his politeness and his obligingness, even after he saw that they were not likely to purchase. He had also shown much knowledge of the art. Constance told him that she had some pictures in her possession which she wished to sell, and requested to be allowed to show them to him. He looked at her deep mourning, her young, beautiful,but sad face, in which the marks of grief and anxiety were too visible. "The daughter of some deceased artist," he said to himself "driven to the necessity of selling his remaining works. Yet her dress does not betoken poverty." He consented to look at the paintings, but added, "A great many things are offered us which it would ruin us to buy at any price." The case was brought into a back room and opened. The paintings were only eight or nine in number; for Constance, after returning from Italy, had contemptuously destroyed nearly all of her early productions. Those she now produced were hastily, but not slightingly, looked at. "hey are by one hand, but very unequal in merit," said the dealer. "Who is the artist?" "The artist wishes to remain unknown-so I brought thlm," said Constance, blushing at her jesuitical answer. Although her words were true, they certainly misled the dealer, already little inclined to suspect her part in them. '  I must have time to look at them," he said, " and will give an answer two days hence." Constance left him and drove back to Mrs. Randall's, full of confidence that her paintings would be more justly valued than her jewels. She did not go out again until 20*  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7202-00000118"/> 234       SAINT CECILIA. the day the picture-dealer appointed for his answer. She then took her maid with her, and drove to the shop. She left the maid in the shop while the dealer conducted her to the large upper room which she had before visited with Miss Randall. The walls were covered with paintings of various kinds and of every degree of merit except the highest. Several persons were in it. "Are you a judge of these things?" the dealer asked. "I have seen much of paintings, and in company with good judges," she answered. She looked around, but it was some time before she discovered her own pictures, and when she did, it at once struck her that if size was an essential element in the value of a picture she would not get much for hers. The dealer paused before them. "There is something peculiar in these pieces. In spite of their careful and elaborate finish, the conception is better than the execu- tion: yet they do not seem to be copies. There is a want of that freedom and boldness of touch which we see in the works of thorough artists; and the painter would have done better not to adopt so small a scale. But his works have one great merit. Each tells its story well. Where would you locate the scene of this?" he asked, pointing to the old fisherman. Constance paused for a moment, then said, "It was painted in M alta " "Likely enough," said the dealer. "It has the Medi- terranean stamped upon it. Worn out with toil, and rejected by the sea, the old man sees no hope on land. HTe is the picture of despondency, and contrasts well with this joyous group laden with the fruits of the vintage." But the dealer now remembered that he was buying, not selling. He proceeded to examine and comment on them with so much sharpness of criticism, mingled with   SAINT CECILIA.        235 his approbation, that Constance began to lower much her estimate of their merits. A severe critic was new to her, and she was afraid to defend her works, for fear of betray- ing the artist's parental affection for them. The dealer was not so much occupied with the paintings but that he found time to eye her very inquisitively. What and who was this young girl, proud in bearing, noble in beauty, shrouded in sadness, as well as in robes of mourning? And what connection had she with the unknown artist? What tale of grief did her history conceal? But her evi- dent annoyance at his survey of her recalled the dealer to his business. He at length named the price he would pay for each piece. The value he put even on the best was so low that Constance protested against it. She at once pointed to several paintings around her with their prices ticketed upon them. "These have little merit," she said. "Is there any proportion between the prices you offer and the prices you ask?" "In nothing is the public taste so uncertain as in the value of paintings," said the dealer; "for most purchasers knowl nothing about the art. In our business, with the best judgment, we buy many a piece we can never sell again. Moreover," he added, with a sarcastic smile, "many of the paintings, you see here are sent to us by artists to sell for them. They set their own value on them, and an extravagant value it usually is." Constance hung her head in disappointment. But she could not wait on the uncertain hope of finding a better market. She cast a sad farewell glance at her much- labored, much-loved,paintings, accepted the price offered, and comforted herself with the reflection that her purse was now sufficiently replenished for her to venture under  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7202-00000119"/> 236        SAINT CECILIA. Mrs. Latimer's roof, and make use of her, without being made use of by her. It was indeed a great comfort to know that heri labor had a money value ; and she left the picture-dealer with a feeling of independence that was new to her. She needed some such feeling to counterbalance her annoyance at per- ceiving that every one she came in contact with,-Mrs. Randall, her daughter, her guests, the jeweller, and the picture-dealer,-all betrayed, through their politeness, a marked curiosity, not unalloyed with suspicion. Suspicion of what? Constance was puzzled and angered; and as Miss Randall was the most prying, and had the best oppor- tunity of indulging her propensity, Constance, in order to avoid her cross-questioning, assumed a marked shade of re- serve toward her. In truth, sle found herself growingsuspi- cious of everybody. She now had nothing to do in London, except to wait for a letter from Mrs. Latimer; and spent her time chiefly in her chamber. Even here she found that curiosity followedl her; for her maid, under pretence of telling how she herself was questioned as to her mis- tress, used no little art to draw out intelligence as to her friends, her family, and her future movements. This only made Constance long the more to shut herself up in Lati- mer Lodge, that she might rid herself of so untrustworthy an attendant.   SAINT CECILIA.         237 CHAPTER XIX.

How delightful is it to find a friend who feels our mis- fortunes as her own I In a day or two Constance received an answer from Mrs. Latimer, written in her best style. She sympathized keenly with her former pupil in her accumu- lated afflictions. She too had known what it was to lose a mother just at that period of life when she most needed her counsels and her care. Unknown to her personally, as Mrs. Guilford had been, she could well conceive, from many small indications which had fallen from Constance, how deserving that mother was of confidence and love. How often too hald Mrs. Latimer regretted the briefness of her intercourse with Colonel Guilford. Yet a single inter- view, and the exchange of a single letter with him, had opened his character to her. She had :been deeply im- pressed. with the warmith of his affections, the justness of thought, and elevation of sentiment which marked his con- versation during their short interview. She had often looked back upon him as the pattern of the veteran officer, whose services and  sacrifices his country had failed adequately to reward. Convinced of the truth of all this, Constance admired Mrs. Latimer's penetration in discover- ing the merits of her parents, and that lady rose in her esteem. Mrs. Latimer went on to express her high ap-  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7202-00000120"/> proval of Constance's resolution to adopt a retired and studious life during her mourning and minority. She had gifts which not to cultivate would be sinful ingratitude to the Giver of them ; and Mrs. Latimer modestly expressed her belief that, with this object, Constance could nowhere find a more suitable home than- Latimer Lodge. But she did not urge her to come. That, by the light of former experience, might be construed into a desire to make Con- stance useful to herself. She'merely said that she had a suitable apartment ready for her; and made no allusion to pecuniary matters, in answer to Constance's inquiries on that point. This was a letter of friendship alone, and Mrs. Latimer had too much good taste to permit the omnipresent pounds, shillings, and pence to show their faces on its pages. Two days after receiving this comforting epistle, Con- stance gazed once more upon the familiar scenes around Latimer Lodge, and again found herself beneath its roof. Mrs. Latimer's reception of her corresponded with the tenor of her letter. She received Constance alone, kissed her tenderly; and Constance could only reply with a shower of tears to the feeling tones in which Mrs. Latimer ex- pressed her sympathy and the interest she felt in her. Constance began to doubt whether she had not miscon- strued this lady's character, and blushed at her own hasty injustice. She soon withdrew to her own rdom, which she found to be one of the most retired in the house, but well adapted to the occupations with which she expected to fill up her hours. Taking a survey of her new quarters, which were not wanting in comfort and conveniences, and looking over the undulating but fertile country to the well-rememibered and charming view of the mountains of Itadnorshire, she made a strong effort to compose herself, and to call up a more trusting, hopeful spirit into her bosom.   On going down-stairs to dinner she had an opportunity of seeing what changes two years had wrought in the household. Most of her elder companions were gone, never to return. Those finished young ladies had been sent forth to dazzle and delight the world. Many of the younger girls of a former day she recognized, shot up in stature and promoted to the places formerly occupied by their seniors. Several of the teachers had at length wrung from Mrs. Latimer the credentials which secured them ad- vantageous posts as governesses, or had escaped from her jurisdiction in some other way. In their places some of Constance's former companions were now serving their apprenticeship to the art of teaching, and already exhibited the worried, jaded look of their predecessors. Looking round the hall, she saw that, although many of the indi- viduals were changed, the scene was the same as when she first saw it; but it had lost all the charm of novelty. She was, however, gratified to find how many of her former companions eagerly expressed their pleasure at seeing her again, although her deep mourning and changed and sad- dened look threw a shade over their greetings. The next morning Constance discharged her maid, giving her, besides her wages, the means of returning to London. This person had once been maid to a young woman of fashion, and exercised much influence over her mistress; but she had lost her place by the loss of her character, had  sunk lower and lower, and had seen in a few years many phases of life, when chance gave her an opportunity of entering Constance's service, at Malta. Believing Colonel Guilford rich, and seeing Constance now an orphan, she had hoped again to become the trusted servant of a fashion- able young lady, the recipient of her confidence and cast-  clothes. Great was her disappointment on being paid off, and she took. her money with a sulky air. She at one  i  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7202-00000121"/> 240        SA fNT CECILIA. returned to London to seek a mistress less fond of seclu- sion; and did not fail to call on Riddell, Junior, to inform him that "Miss Guilford had shut herself up in what was for all the world just like what those foreigners call a con- vent." And she claimed and received the promised guinea. The maid had been paid and had left her, when Con- stance's eye fell on the receipt she had taken for the wages. She remarked the date, " 17th of September." At this hour, on this day month, where was she? Seated by her father's sick-bed, nursing him, conversing with him, striv- ing to cheer him in his marked depression, but not aware that the hand of death was upon him. How long ago did this seem I How much had happened since then I How much of sorrow, and anxiety, and perplexity were crowded into this little month! What a multitude of scenes and faces thronged upon her I The death-chamber, the funeral, the crowd of sympathizing strangers around her, thevoyage, the journey, the throngs of London, the inquisitive faces of all with whom she had dealt, the solicitors, the jeweller, the picture-dealer, Mrs. Randall, her daughter and her guests,-the whole phantasmagoria of scenes, persons, in- cidents, griefs, and bewildering thoughts rose up before her: all these faces were staring at her. The whole seemed to be a vision. Had she just waked up from a long and troubled sleep? Here she sat, as formerly, in the dreary old Lodge, looking out, as was her wont, on the blue mountains of Radnorshire. What if the whole of the last two years was a dream? But Constance soon shook off this reverie. Life is not a dream; and she faced the realities of her situation. In not many months the cost of living at Latimer Lodge would empty her purse, and she must find within that time the means of replenishing it. She had nothing to look to but her own exertions. Come what may she resolved that   SAINT CECJLIA.         241 neither Lord Faringdon nor Mrs. Beresford should hear froni her. He was her father's brother, estranged from him forK irty years. She and Constance's mother had lived for years in the same house as sisters, yet she had never inquired after her during the latter half of her life. Con stance would not seek their bounty or protection I Must she, then, descend from the rank in which she was born, and sink into the position of the working classes? Pride revolted against this, while he-r conscience told her that it should be stifled as a false and unchristian pride. She was thankful that she had it solmewhat in her power to choose her occupation. She might find employment as a governess. But what more thankless, hopeless office? What do people expect to find united in those who fill it'? The learning of a professor, the accomplishments of a prima donna, with the wages of a butler, and the humility and, self-denial of a nun. She must bestow on her pupils all that gives ease, and elevation, and independence, and retain for herself no more of these qualities than the slave whom the Roman patrician has had trained to learning, that he might become the pedagogue of his master's sons. Con- stance rejected the imaginary position offered her with a scornful toss of the head. She knew that Mrs. Latimer would gladly have her assistance in her school. But with Mrs. Latimer for patroness and employer, there was pecu- liar point in the lament of the old dramatist: "O the inconstant And rotten ground of service! 'Tis as one Who takes a long slumber by a dying fire, And parts thence imore cold than when he first sat down." Constance was resolved to keep herself independent, and one resource was left her. Disappointed as she had been at the small price her paintings had commanded, 21  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7202-00000122"/> 242        SAINT CELILI. she now knew that they had a value, and probably a higher value than that hurried sale would indicate. And to her this occupation had some peculiar recommendations. Not only she had a strong love for it, but she could work at it quietly, secretly, and live by the labor of her hands, without any sacrifice of her pride. The labor of her hands I Why did she thus degrade this noble art? The painter's pencil, like the poet's pen, does but give expression to the conceptions of the mind; and why might not she hope to rise to eminence in art? Her eyes brightened, hopes, un- defined but brilliant, flitted before her, and her life of recluse labor did not look so dreary. Her room was not cramped in size, and received from the north that steady light which painters love. A con- venient closet could conceal her easel and canvas from the prying eyes of visitors, who might otherwise suspect that she sought to be something more than an amateur artist. She had replenished her stock of artist materials while in London. She had now formed a definite plan of life, and hastened to act upon it. Books and painting should divide her time; and as the easel she had ordered had not yet arrived, she employed herself in arranging her few books in the small bookcase, and in looking over her portfolio, selecting from among the studies she had already prepared those which best deserved to be elaborated into finished works. To be busy is to be half happy, yea, more than half. At the dinner-table Constance occupied the post of honor, being seated at Mrs. Latimer's right hand. That lady seemed disposed to make a companion of her, as the most cultivated and intellectual person within her reach. To- day Constance found seated opposite to her the old French teacher, Monsieur D'Iberville; for Mrs. Latimer had now so arranged matters that the old gentleman dined with her on the two days in the week on which he devoted two   SAI NT CECILIA.     ,  243 hours to her pupils. It is true that he could not teach much to forty or fifty girls in that time. But the world does not inquire nicely into these matters. Mrs. Latiner was content to do most of the work herself, and economize her money; while her school enjoyed the reputation of having the services of so accomplished a French master as Monsieur D'Iberville. He expressed great delight at seeing Constance. She had been a favorite with him of old. He glanced at her deep mourning and gazed at her pale face, but made no allusion to the circumstances under which she had re- turned. But her presence seemed to stimulate his conver- sational powers, fatigued and sickened as he was with the dull routine of correcting the errors of negligent pupils in the elements of his native tongue. Hle enjoyed the society of so intelligent a listener ; for Constance was not in spirits to take -a very animated part in the conversation, which, to Mrs. Latimer's gratification, was altogether in the French tongue. Constance was pleased to meet again this amiable and high-bred old gentleman, who, with a mingled air of gallantry and parental affection, made her the chief object of his attention. From this time his din- ners at Latimer Lodge became bright spots in the week to him, and he talked, and listened, and sipped his table-beer as if it had the flavor of Sillcry or Chateau Margaut. These conversations in French, in which Mrs. Latimer took some part, were often entertaining and brilliant, for Monsieur D'Ibervillc, from his original rank and his subse- quent misfortunes, had seen much of the world; and Constance, stimulated by his vivacity, recovered in his company much of her animation. But these conversations were, in one respect, very tantalizing to Mrs. Latimer. She could not make money of them. She had always claimed for her school the merit of giving to the pupils a  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7202-00000123"/> 244        SAINT CECILIA. mastery of the French tongue in its greatest purity. But she knew that this was rather aimed at than attained; the nearest approach to it occurring during the year that Con- stance was nominally a member, really the teacher of the highest French class. On Constance's return Mrs. Lati- mer at once fell to plotting how she could make her services available at the least cost; for cost was ever the primary consideration with. her. Constant to one object, she was bent on making every one help to raise the Latiners of Latimer Lodge to the rank they had once held in the county. We should, mention that Charley Latimer had now transferred his financial operations in learning to Oxford, and seemed to be doing his part well. This only stimulated his mother in hers, and she made every effort to sustain the reputation of her establishment, which was bringing in a golden harvest. It was very provoking to Mrs. Latimer that Constance, contrary to her former habit, would now converse with no one but Monsieur in any other language than English. She had evidently resolved that her linguistic acquirements should not be used, as they had been, to Mrs. Latimer's profit. That lady had no reason to suppose that Constance would accept employment in her school. But if necessity should drive her to it, she should have to ask for it, and then must be content with a low salary. But to offer such  employment would be telling her that her services were worth much. Mrs. Latimer's curiosity, sharpened by interest, was piqued to ascertain all she could as to Constance's condi- tion, her friends, her occupations, and her pecuniary re- sources During the school hours, and longer, Constance habitually shut herself up in her own room. Slhe had indeed consulted Mrs. Latimer as to her reading, and bor- rowed hooks from her librar ; but these evidently did not   SAINT CECILIA.        245 fill up her time. Mrs. Latimer surmised tlat she was endeavoring to turn her time to direct profit, 'and shrewdly suspected what talent she relied upon. Constance was induced to spend her evenings frequently in Mrs. Latimer's dr'awing-room, and had much intercourse with her. But although conversing freely with that lady and the elder girls, she never alluded to her friends, if she had any, and seldom to incidents in her earlier life. She  received no letters, as Mrs. Latimer knew; for all letters for the Lodge passed through her hands. But she was not a woman easily baffled. She had no right to question Constance, and shunned the very appear- ance of doing it. But she knew her truth and directness, and had at times rather shrunk from the latter. But she would now use them for her purpose. One evening, 'when Constance chanced to be alone with her, she took up the "Times,"' and, running her eyes over the columns, made an occasional comment. As she read she camle to a debate in the House of Lords which she had looked at before. The subject was, "The Affairs of Ire- land." "A weary subject," said Mrs. Latimer. "They will never be settled as long as any Irish are left there. Let me see who took part in the debate. The Duke of "-- . I was once in company with his grace.

"I have never seen him," said Constance, starting at this sudden question. ' Nor a portrait of him?" continued Mrs. Latimer, look- ing at her in a quiet, casual way. "I never saw one," Constance answered, with marked confusion. "As you are of the same family of Guilford, I supposed that you had seen him,"' said Mrs. Latimer, quietly. "But the relationship is probably remote." She had now ascer- tained what she wished to know, but continued to look over the debate and comment on the speakers, that Con- stance might not suspect her manceuvre. But, with the names of many noblemen on her lips, her thoughts were on only one member of the Iouse of Lords. She knew that, after his own children, Constance was Lord Faring- don's nearest living relative. "Yet, he takes no mlore account of her than of a dairymaid. lIe seems not to recognize her existence." It Was now evident that Con- stance stood alone in the world. She had no home but Latimer Lodge, and Mrs. Latimer resolved that she should make herself useful there. Meanwhile, the life that Constance was leading was laborious, and its general tenor solitary and sad. She could not, she did not wish, to forget the past. Those bright spots on her memory, suddenly overcast by suc- cessive griefs, were in strong contrast with her present life of desolation. Yet her situation was less irksome than it had threatened to be. She was occupied, and took a keen interest in her occupations. And finding, in that large but busy household, some companions of not uncongcnial tempers, the natural joyousness of youth at times raised her above the depressing conditions that surrounded her.   SAINT CECILIA.        247 An occasional fear shot through her heart that she night not succeed in maintaining, herself by her present occupation. In this anxiety, as soon as she had nearly completed a second picture, she wrote to the dealer in Lon- don, reminding him of those he had purchased from her, and inquiring whether he would receive and offer for sale others by the same artist; and she received a favorable answer without loss of time. This was encouraging, Hope, and even confidence, re- vived. She had almost completed her second piece. It was her best. The most happily conceived, the most skilfully executed,-at least, ,she thought so. Whether hler progress in art was such that each piece marked a step onward, or whether parental love for the youngest born misled her judlgment, with her the last work was always the best. She stood at her easel. The picture, her best concep- tion, was finished. No. It still needed a few light, well- considered touches for its conmpletion; a labor of time, in- deed, but a labor of love, and the hours flew swiftly by her while so employed. "A little thing gives perfection; but perfection is not a little thing." With this aphorism of a great artist swelling in her heart and rising to her lips,-but modesty overruled vanity and stopped it there,- she stepped back and surveyed her work from the proper distance. Sle dwelt upon it delighted with her success. Like a mlotler gazing on her infant, she was loath to trust her offspring to anotlher's care. Yet, sold it must be, and speedily. From the picture, her thoughts ran on to its destination. The picture-dealer's shop rose before her. A succession of connoisseurs passed in review before her eyes, all largely mingling adliration with their criticism. Some, especially charmed with her work, returning the next day to feast their eyes, find the picture sold, and her  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7202-00000125"/> 248        SAINT CRCILIA. imagination follows it to its resting-place. Before her mind's eye rises a pretentious villa, newly built, at Isling- tan. In the gaudily furnished drawing-room stands a well- known grocer, bald, fat, and jolly, rejoicing in the plum, on which he has retired from his greasy trade. Resting his weight of eighteen stone on his sturdy left leg, his left hand on his hip, his right foot advanced, his right arm ex- tended in an oratorical flourish, he is expatiating to his friend, who has not yet made his plum, on the grandeur and luxury of his new home. "IThis carpet, sir, on which we stand,-Axnminster, sir, genuine Axminster,-cost sixty pound, sir, sixty pound. Mrs. P--'s choice, sir.

We, who are able to patronize the arts," and he slapped his pocket with emphasis, " should remember these poor devils of artists. When a man has made his money, sir, he should not lock it up, like a miser, but enjoy it, sir, enjoy it, and let other people enjoy it, too." And this modern Macenas rubbed his greasy hands tpgeither in a fit of intense satisfaction with himself and all the world. The vision was so vivid and mortifying to Constance that she hurled ,her brush to the farthest corner of the room. But presently she meekly went and took it up with a quiet, sad smile. "No more of this," she said, shaking her head, gravely; "such visions freeze all better inspiration, and are fatal to all high art." --The two paintings received the last finishing strokes, and Constance, employing Mrs. Latimer's old Scotch gar- dener as her agent, packed them up neatly and sent them off to London. She made this man understand that she aimed at secrecy in this transaction. A Scotchman is usually a trusty agent; but this old fellow was too trusty. He was quite as much Mrs. Latimer's spy and detective as her gardener. Before the paintings left the Lodge, he faithfully reported to her the exact dimensions of this long, wide, shallow box, with its destination, and the picture- dealer's name and direction elegantly painted on it by Constance's brush, affording happy examples of Hlogarth's line of beauty. While Constance was congratulating her- self on the secrecy with which she was conducting her artistic labors, Mrs. Latimer was pluming herself, with better reason, on the secrecy and accuracy of her intelli- gence, and took credit to herself for great delicacy in not opening the case and examining the pictures before they reached the dealer's hands. But she had little faith in the pecuniary value of the works of very young artists, and smiled at the slender resource on which Constance relied  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7202-00000126"/> 250       3AllV T UEUllLA. for independence. Whether from the dealer's hands Con- stance's chef-d'oeuvre reached the villa of the retired grocer at Islington, or whether it found a worthier destination, history does not tell. Convinced of the peculiar merits of these, her last pro- ductions, Constance thought that she had shown great moderation in demanding less than double the price the picture-dealer had paid her for the two best of her former works. Some anxious, but not idle weeks elapsed, and she began to fear that she had defeated her own object by being too greedy of gain, when a letter from the dealer informed her that he had at length been lucky enough to find a purchaser for the paintings. But he more than hinted that the artist had reached the highest price his pencil could command. Even this degree of success was encouragin,. But Constance would have been yet more encouraged, and quite as much provoked, had she known that the dealer had only delayed writing to abate her ex- pectations; he having at once taken the paintings at her price, and sold theml for more the next day. Before Virgil's day, and since, the poet, the artist, and the in- ventor have had constant occasion to sing in his strain, "Sic vos non vobis." It is in the enthusiastic exercise of its powers that genius must find its chief reward. Little of the profit that ultimately accrues from its productions returns to reward the teeming brain and skilful hand from whence they sprang. The world reserves its golden prizes for those who possess talents of another kind: for the masters of the great art of making profit out of the genius and toil of others more gifted than themselves.   CHAPTER XX. "Worse than idle is compassion If it ends-in tears and sighs; Thee from bondage would I rescue And from vile indignities."- VonnSWORTH. CONSTANCE toiled and studied, and Mrs. Latimer watched her with catlike vigilance, hoping to find some way of drawing her into her service. It was evident that Con- stance was ,without friends, probably without any resource but what she managed to find in her efforts in art. Mrs. Latimer never having seen any productions of her pencil, and knowing how badly paid artists usually are, looked upon this as a slender staff to lean on. She felt sure that Constance would soon have to apply 'to her for employ- me6nt; and then she could secure her services on her own termls. It was surprising to see how much pahis Mrs. Latimer would take to attain her objects, many of them small, but producing by combination a great result-the rebuilding of the house of Latimer.  Being politic as able, she aimed at making herself agreeable to all who come in con- tact with her, and seldom failed to do so Constance was impulsive, unlelfish, and not prone to suspicion. But there is in frank and truthful natures an instinct that de- tects the presence of falsehood; an intuitive wisdom which we often lose as we grow older, less pure, and more con- taminated by the world. Men often blind the eyes of their fellows; but seldom can the schoolmaster conceal his true character from his boys. We have our spon- taneous likings and antipathies without being able to give  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7202-00000127"/> 252        SAINT CECILIA. a reason for them, any more than the infant who shrinks  firom one stranger and throws himself into the arms of another, and generally has good cause for his choice. Constance rather felt than knew that Mrs. Latimcr was  false; and while aware that much was to be gained in her society, she was one of the, last persons to whom she would have opened her heart. She was bent on keeping herself independent of her; and pride as well as policy made her anxious to conceal from her her poverty and friendliness. To become one of her teachers would be stepping downwalrd in social position. Yet it required great industry in her present occupation to maintain her- self in so expensive a home ; the only household open to her. Constance and Mrs. Latimer, each having her own object, were thus pitted against each other; and tile struggle between them was not as unequal as it seemcd. It lasted several months; nor would Mrs. Latimer have won had not Constance's sympathy for distress led her to make a sacrifice to relieve it, which for a time inter- rupted the pursuit of her own interests. One evening bhe amet an assistant teacher, Miss Ap- Rice, going to her room in tears. She was not one of those best known to her. But she stopped and asked the cause of her distress. Sympathy at once opened the young woman's heart, and she told Constance that she had just received a letter informing her of her, father's alarming illness, and had hastened to Mrs. Latimer to get leave to go to him at once. But that lady was iever in a hurry to believe in sudden illness that interfered with her plans. Miss Ap-Iice was the daughter of a poor vicar in Rad- norshire, twenty mniles off; and she filled an important part in the instruction of the younger girls. Another teacher being just now laid up by indisposition, Mrs. Latimer refused to spare her at this time.   SAINT CECILIA.        253 Constance's face flushed with indignation at Mrs. Latimer's want of feeling. She herself would not have hesitated one moment what to do. Miss Ap-Rice per- ceived her impulse, for she felt as she did. "I would go at once," she said, "and never come back. But, unluckily, father owes Mrs. Latimer more than a hundred pounds, which I have undertaken to work out; and on my father's account, I dare not defy her." "How came he in debt to Mrs. Latimer?"Constance asked. "Iy father wished to educate me for a governess, and stinted his whole family to do it. But his means failed; and he was about to take me from school when Mrs. Latimer offered to keeD me and take his bond for what would become due. He gave it for two hundred pounds, and I was to pay it by my services as an assistant teacher. I have led a slave's life for more than two yeats, and have not ,paid half of it. But it was the only way I could com- plete my education ; and Mrs. Latimer's recommendation is worth much to a governess."   ' "I have heard," said Constance, "that Mrs. Latimer knew how to put out her money at good interest. This investment was charitable and profitable at once. But what can be done in the case?"Then struck by a sudden thought, she asked, "What do you teach?" "Arithmetic, geography, and grammar, to the second and third forms." "Perhaps your father's illness may not keep you away long," Constance said. "I may'be a little rusty in some of your branches. But go' to Mrs. Latimer, and offer me for your substitute. I think she will accept me, at least for a short time." Miss Ap-Rice could not; thank her enough, and hastened back to Mrs. Latimier; who not only readily accepted her 22  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7202-00000128"/> 254        SAINT CECILIA. substitute, but detained her to express her own regret that the peculiar circumstances had compelled her to refuse her first request. As whatever Constance undertook to do, she strove to do well, she made Miss Ap-Rice explain to her fully the duties she had undertaken. Inathe morning Miss Ap-Rice was already many miles on her way home, when Constance took her place in the school-room,-a little surprised to find herself there. The duties Constance had undertaken occupied all those hours of broad daylight available to the artist. The vicar continued ill so long, that many weeks elapsed before his daughter could return to her post; and Constance saw with alarm that no industry would enable her to get two pictures ready for the dealer in time to make up the amount she wished to pay Mrs. Latimcr at the beginning of a new term. She was much disturbed at this, as she had resolved to show Mrs. Latimer that she was at ease as to the con- dition of her purse. At length Miss Ap-Rice came back to her work, full of gratitude to Constance, and of regret at having imposed on her so tedious a. task. Constance resumed her palette and brush, and worked with redoubled industry. Although her purse was somewhat light, she carried herself with so independent an air that Mrs. Latimer concluded to make an overture to her, instead of waiting for an application for employment, which might never be made. She began with a compliment,- "I almost regret Miss Ap-Rice's return, Constance. You filled her place with so much ease, and carried on her de- partment so smoothly, that we all miss you in the school- room. You have a natural aptitude for teaching, and for commanding the attention of your pupils. I am satisfied that it cannot be to you an irksome task." In itself it is not, madam," said Constance. "But it   SAINT CECILIA.        255 interrupts other occupations. Just now I am anxious not to teach, but to learn." "Very true," said Mrs. Latimer. "Yet it may be to your advantage to employ a few hours daily in teaching. To speak plainly, my dear, I am convinced, although you never told me so, that your friends are not rich; and at such an establishment as this, kept up at, great cost, the inmates necessarily live at much expense. You Miight save all it costs you to live here by spending three or four hours a day in teaching the higher French and German classes. '  "Three or four hours?" thought Constanice. "I might spare that time. But how long are Mrs. Latimer's hours?" Then she satid aloud, "You are quite right, madam, in supposing that economy is important to me. But time, too, is inportant to me. Will you give me until to-mor- row to think of this?" Mrs. Latimer consenting to this, Constance went to her room. There she paced up and down impatiently, then thoughtfully. "There is no escape from it," she said. "'ride will have a fall, and I suppose will deserve it. I did hope to maintain myself as an artist in secret, and let no one know that the daughter of Colonel Guilford-the granddaughter of the Earl of Faringdon, the descendant, too, of the proud Warrens of Polworth-was earning her living by the labors of her hands.

But she was only a physician's daughter, while I am--  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7202-00000129"/> -256        SAINT CECILIA. There is pride again. God has thrust me down below the rank in which I was born. Let me accept his decree with resignation, and learn the lesson He would teach me. Nothing is more unchristian than pride." Constance now sat down to consider Mrs. Latimer's offer. It was convenient and well-timed. It secured her a comfortable home, in which she was of acknowledged use. The occupation would be of rather a, high order; at least she would make it so. She would still have leisure to devote to her art without the necessity of painting against time, and of earning so many pounds per quarter. But any agreement with Mrs. Latimer must be too precise for that exacting lady to overstep the terms. Constanlce also feared that her engagement might be made an excuse for diminishing the compensation paid Monsieur D'Ibcr- ville, who had grown old and less exacting to his pupils; for she was too much attached to the old man to let herself be used as the means of injuring him. Seeking Mrs. Latimer early the next morning, she agreed to devote from three to four hours daily to teaching French and German; but only under the superintendence of Mon- sieur and the German master. Mrs. Latimer assented to this, attributing Constance's proviso to diffidence, not to the true motive. She had sub- stantially attained her end, and would in time give a large margin to the terms of agreement. While Constance was striving to trample down her pride, Mrs. Latimer saw how much she was swayed by it; that not being paid wages like a hireling, but only teaching a few hours as an equivalent for being provided with a home, operated as a salvo to her feelings. Mrs. Latimer could look into other people's hearts. If she chanced to look into her own, she found no difficulty in dealing with her conscience for exacting service so valuable at the   SAINT CECILIA.,        257 cheapest possible price, from a young lady who was in her power, because she could nowhere else find a respectable home. Mrs. Latimer had one paramount duty to fulfil. The Latimers of Latimer LodgO must raise their heads above Water,-they had suffered an eclipse, they must shine forth again. To bring this about was her one duty in life. Iiappy are they who have but one duty and fulfil it well. The change in Constance's occupations relieved her of anxiety for the future, and brought her a feeling of com- parative ease. And this ease of heart showed itself in a natural wa y,-the revival of her love of music, which had lain dormant. Since her return to the Lodge she had been punctual in her attendance at the parish church. Being both afflicted and devout she felt it to be at once a duty and a relief. She found comfort and consolation there. After her experience of the unbelief of France, the specu- lative mysticism of Germlany, the mummery and idolatry of Rome, the solitary and variant Christianity of individual continental Protestants, she recognized the value of a living faith and a national church. But one thing detracted from her satisfaction. The old rector, a worthy man, not vanting in learning, sense, or zeal, had only ear enough for music to distingouish between the organ and the church-bells. This perhaps was the reason why the choir was so miser- able in spite of the efforts made to improve it by the organist, unsustained by higher authority. With Constance, de- votional feelings found their fullest and most natural ex- pression in song. This unsatisfied craving led her to procure the music used in the church, and whatever she heard marred during the service on Sunday, she spent the evening in doing justice to it in one of the music-rooms at the Lodge. Her voice had excited the admiration of her teacher at Rome, and he had heard the best singers of the last thirty 22*'  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7202-00000130"/> years. It now fascinated the less cultivated ears of her companions. ILer music-room became popular. Selecting   i from among the girls those most able to sustain her, she soon formed a choir; and the Sunday evening concerts be- came the most attractive pleasure at Latimer Lodge. As the musical education of so many girls required many in- struments in separate rooms,-each room was small,-and the choir claimed and exercised the privilege of limiting the number of their audience, Constance had also to modu- late her voice to suit the size of the apartment; so that, even to those most familiar with the sweetness and com- pass of her voice, its power remained unknown; nor was she herself fully aware of it. When her audience was very select, and especially when none were present but the musicians, Constance often in- dulged her enthusiastic impulse to represent by action the sentiment to which she was giving musical expression. Eyes, features, attitude, and gesture, all combined and har- monized with the voice. Yet no trace of exaggeration marred the grace of her impassioned action. A classic simplicity and purity pervaded all, exciting the admiration of her companions, who pronounced her performance music both to eye and ear, delighting two senses at once. Mrs. Latimer, who knew how to appropriate everything to herself, took occasion to speak of her choir, and of her assiduous cultivation of sacred music, in such terms to Mrs. Fuller, the rector's wife, that this lady expressed a strong- desire to hear it; and a concert was got up one evening in the week for her gratification. Tlhe merits of the perform- ance were not altogether lost on her, but she felt it her duty to uphold the church choir as an integral part of the establishment. While praising the performance of Mrs. Latimer's pupils, as excellent drawing-room music, only too operatic for devotional purposes, she assured Mrs.   ---- ^.     ^259 Latimer that it would utterly fail in the church. The church, she said, not only needed a different stvle, but re- quired a greater volume of sound to fill it. Being a home- keeping woman, seldom out of the parish of St. Mary's, Orton, in the last twenty years, the parish church, of rather unusual dimensions for-a rural parish, had gradually ex- panded, in her eyes, to cathedral size. Mrs. Latimer and the parson's wife stoutly battled this musical question ; but the latter was too true to the church to give up the cause of the choir. Finding it impossible to open her eyes, or rather her ears, to the difference between the squealing dis- cord of her choir and the divine harmony of the highly- gifted and well-trained sing'ers of the Lodge, Mrs. Latimer abandoned the contest with polite contempt. MrshFuller bore off the palm of victory; that is, she was the most dog- matic in her assertions, and had the last word. But her triumph did not last long. Meanwhile Constance labored zealously and successfully in her new position as a teacher. Her method of teach- ing language was largely by conversation. Her daily in- tercourse for several hours with the elder girls, some of them as old as herself, revived that vivacity which soli- tary occupations had depressed; an-d that vivacity gave an interest to her conversation, and to her teaching, which led her. pupils to make rapid progress in the languages in which she conversed with and questioned them. Her sue. cess in -this, and the development which she was giving  to the musical talents of many of Mrs. Latimer's pupils,  made that lady more gracious to her than ever.  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7202-00000131"/> CHAPTER XXI. "Sorrow and love are sacred: sealed in death More sacred still. With sacrilegious hand Wrench not the slab from the ancestral tomb That thou may'st peer within."-OLD PLAY. AT length another of those eventful eras, which mark the annals of a school, was at hand: another holiday was emptying Latimer Lodge, but not so completely as in former days. Mrs. Latimer, as usual, set out on her diplomatic tour through the adjacent counties; but her widening fame had now brought under her care several pupils whose parents were in India or other remote colo- nies, and who, having no near relatives in, England, re- mained during the holidays at the Lodge under the care of two of the teachers, who had instructions to procure them every reasonable diversion the neighborhood af- forded. Although the Lodge was not now so desolate as it had been on a former occasion, Constance did not witness the joyous departure of so many of its inmates, and miss the sight of so many familiar and friendly faces, without de- pression. It brought strongly home to her heart her own friendless condition; more acutely felt from knowing that nature and the ties of blood had designed for her a crowd of friends among the highest in the land. But she had her resource. During the partial interruption of her artistic labors some choice conceptions had ripened in her mind, and she had looked forward to this period of leisure to work them out. This leisure time had come; but now she sat listlessly at her window, gazing out on the blue   mountains of Radnorshire, with the misty clouds resting on their flanks. She longed to breathe the pure, sharp mountain air, to toil up the heights, to ramnble throuogh the secluded dells, and to draw inspiration from tle scenes of beauty and grandeur which nature there dis- played. But gradually her thoughts glided round to the design on which she had already bestowed much study; it rose in vivid conception before her; and she rose hastily to give a fixed form to the fleeting delineations which her imagination had traced. When she had once entered on her work all feelings of solitude and depression vanished. Hers was one of those earnest natures which throws its whole being into the task on hand. The nature of her occupation called on her to people the solitude around her with the creations of a prolific fancy. Labor gave a zest to the little leisure she allowed herself, anld she no longer missed the crowd of her companions who usually thronged the Lodge. The holidays were swiftly passing away. Her work, her best conception, for it was her latest, was finished. She sat long looking at it, enjoying her success, and felt a kind of fondness for the piece, which made her resolve. not to part with it yet awhile. But she bad overworked herself, and felt inclined to let herself and her art rest awhile. Neither did she feel like reading, or talking, or walking; but sat thoroughly idle in the room, letting her thoughts roam whither they would. Soon they glided back to the past, and she now remembered that in the sad hours of preparation for leaving Malta, while packing up miany mementos of her father's past life,.she had put  away some packages of old letters which he seemed to  hnve kept with peculiar care. She now sought them, and   ,i with keen, sad interest, sat down to examine them.  The first parcel that came to hand were her own letters   &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7202-00000132"/> g26        SAINT CECILIA. to her father and mother. She glanced at a few of them.  But the contrast between her condition and feelings now and then was too painful; and, with tears in her eyes, she put them aside. Her hand next lit upon a letter in a hand unknown to her. It was from that Lady Acton of whom she had so often heard her mother speak, and Con- stance read it eagerly. It contained a few details as to the writer, many as to her boy Arthur, and many kind wishes and inquiries as to Miss Warren and the dean. It brought freshy back to Constance her fellow-voyager to Dover, and her mother's copious details as to a brief period of his childhood. Constance put it carefully aside as something she would preserve. The next packet contained letters from her mother while at Dijon and Dresden to her father in India. Here Con- stance unexpectedly found herself at times treading on new ground. With much that her mother had to say she was of course familiar. But much, very much was new to her, or seen from a new standpoint. The fears, the hopes, the yearnings of the absent wife, the anxieties of the watchful mother, remarks and refections on the scenes and characters around her, and, above all, the per- petual recurrence of Constance's own name, accompanied by indications of ceaseless vigilance, high hopes, tem- pered by fears of the multitude of evils besetting a young girl of enthusiastic temper, just awakening to the con- sciousness of strong passions and high powers. Constance now learned what she had scarcely suspected, that far more than disgust at the scoffing unbelief of France, anx- iety at the wily approaches of emissaries of Popery, trained to insinuate themselves into the confidence of youth,-a n anxiety sharpened by the interest Constance had shown in the Romish ritual, an interest rather artistic than de- votional,-had 'hurried her mother from Dijon, and car-   SA2 INT CECILIA.       263 ried her to Dresden. Here, too, Constance perceived from the later letters-that as her own mind had opened and her interest expanded toward the higher regions of thought and inquiry, how often her mother had trembled lest her daughter should become inoculated with that spirit of boundless speculation and scepticism which had rendered the German mind incapable of cleaving to any steadfast faith. In these letters Herr Rhodoman was not forgotten, and Constance here found proofs that her mother had valued him less for his varied attainments and his skill in art than for an earnest simplicity of faith worthy of Luther's day. Constance was still meditating on the hopes, and fears, and wisdom of her Christian mother, when her eye fell on a third packet put up with indications of peculiar care. She opened it. The letters were plainly older than the other parcels. They were soiled, and even worn by fre- quent handling. The ink was faded, and although she recognized both her father and m-other's hands, they were different from what they had become in after-life. She found that these letters had been arranged, without refer- ence to the writers, according to their dates; and it was plain that they had been read and re-read, and dwelt upon, with no common interest. She looked at the first and the last date. Beginning more than thirty years back, they covered more than four years; the fond, the anxious period between her parents' first vows and their marriage- day. These lines had been penned only for one eye: these fervent vows had been breathed only for one ear. The sacred seal of secrecy was upon them. Constance put the letters gently down, and walked to and fro in her chamber.  There was a struggle within her. Could it be right? Would ii not be a breach of confidence in her to pry into  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7202-00000133"/> the inmost recesses of her parents' hearts, as betrayed to her by these letters which her father had so carefully pre- served, perused, and dwelt upon in the lonely hours of his bereavement, yet never by one word to her alluding to their existence? Much as he treasured them during his life, he probably wished them destroyed on his death, and that duty devolved on her. Constance could not but remember that both father and nother shunned, in her presence, alluding to their days of courtship and early married life. Had they not some good reason for doing so? And should she now intrude, after their deaths, into the secret chambers of their hearts, which they had so carefully closed to her while they yet lived? But how many things are there which the parent cannot tell the child, yet would gladly have her know! Constance did not for one moment doubt the truth and purity of her parents, yet could well understand that much that they would not tell her during their lives they would wish her to know after their deaths. Alone as she was in the world, she felt that her mother and father were still nearer to her than any living beings. She was identified with then) in a peculiar manner. Their existence was continued and united in her. She, their sole offspring and exclusive care, still breathed their sentiments, felt their emotions, and re-echoed their convictions. She had never fallen under any other influence,-excepting once,-and here she paused in her restless walk, and sighed when she remem- bered that portion of her life in Malta. Rousing herself, she recalled her thoughts, wandering far, away. Her eye again fell on the letters. She was, for one of so inquiring a mind, singularly, painfully ignorant of the private history of the families of both her parents. Her bare genealogy was all she knew. Alone in the world, without one, out of a crowd of living kinsmen, even asking whether she   existed, her feelings naturally flowed back to the past, to those who would have felt an interest in her well-being, as  more or less remotely their offspring. These letters, run-  i ning through years, evidently copious in detail, would they  tell her nothing of family history which she ought to know? And w hat on earth could so interest her affections as this -orrespondence? She was the sole living offspring of the vriters, the prolongation of their united being. Was it )ot an excess of scrupulosity that deterred her? Her Ifections found a strong ally in a natural curiosity which ngeniously suggested that it mi st have been obvious to Jer father that she would be tempted to read them ; yet here was nothing from whch she could infer a prohibition o exa0nine them. Curiosity won the day, and she sat [own to read. Among the earlier letter'sher father's were far the most olulinous. The young lover full of ardent affection 1c young soldier full of high hopes, his adventurous pro- 'ssion crowding on him events and impressions intensely iteresting to himself and to her who loved him.

Constance dwelt on ese passages with strange interest, sometimes doubting e reality of the dreamy past, sometimes shrinking giltily, if she had caught herself in the act of violating a shrine, this intrusive prying into the early secrets of her mother's tiden heart, of the young girl of more than thirty years o, younger than she herself was now, not older than she is when she filst met with-- But no her memory 23  1  ^I  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7202-00000134"/> 266       SAINT CECILIA. shall not drag her back to incidents in her own life. Her imagination shall not betray her into wandering off to dis- tant Oriental lands. Her thoughts shall not range beyond England,-beyond Latimer Lodge, and the work she has in hand. The next letter Constance opened gave an account of her mother's first visit to Felthorpe Park; of the impres- sion made on her by the contrast between the quiet deanery and the spacious and luxurious hlome of a family of higl rank. She stated with delicacy, yet frankness, the impres- sion made on her by the small family circle there. The gentle, invalid mother, whose heart promptly opened to receive a daughter at the choice of her son. Tihe stately and somewhat reserved father, divided between kindly and hospitable impulses and prudential doubts, yet yielding at length to the new influence brought under his roof. The frank, joyous, gallant elder brother, who sought to put at her ease the young stranger who was to be his brother's bride. The following letters showed how completely she had become at home at the Park; and her lover's answers expressed his joy at the progress she was making in iden- tifying herself with the family there. In one passage her mother writes: "In spite of your father's kindness to me, I have perceived at times that he thinks that you are not only doing a foolish thing in mar- rying a penniless girl like myself, but that you have taken a step downward in search of a wife. I confess he there wounded my family pride. But on being reminded that I am one of the very few remaining descendants of the Warrens of Polworth, who often made themselves known in court and camip, and retained their importance until within a generation or two, he has evidently had more con- sideration for me. My dead ancestors stood me in as good stead as if they had left me a more solid dowry." In   SAINT CECILIA.        267 another letter she says: "I had heard that your brother was'not domestic in his habits; but I must have been mis- informed. I always find him at Feltiorpe Park, and his joyous temper and vivacity of mind much enliven what, with all its grandeur, would otherwise be a dull home to your father and mother; for the condition of her health prevents their receiving much company. I hope I have succeeded in making myself not only acceptable but useful to her, and I regret that my duty to my uncle, who, you know, is a father to me, 'prevents my making her longer and more frequent visits." Upon these early letters of her father and mother, full, frank, and fond in their tone, Constance dwelt with a mix- ture of delight and sadness. Besides telling her so much that she had longed and had a right to know, they were redolent of the loves and happiness of two pure and youthful hearts, joyous in the present, and looking hope- fully forward, with no foreboding glimpse of the thirty years since past, so full of trials, perplexities, and sorrows to them. Constance read, and pondered, and pictured to herself the persons and scenes which interested her so deeply. Now smiling, now in tears, she lived over again the past of a former generation; for she identified herself with the writers of these letters, feeling that their being was not only continued, but united, in herself; and she for- gave herself the curiosity which had prompted her to read them. They contained full details of all that interested both her parents. The life of the finlmily at Felthorpe Park was described in all its phases, the elder brother being ever a conspicuous figuree in the picture. Many par- ticulars as to the-dean, the deanery, of her mother's do- mestic life and family history, of her father's early career in the army,-all had for, Constance an intense interest. She came now to letters of a more startling character.  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7202-00000135"/> 268        SA4 NT CECIL [IA. First her mother's, written on hearing of the death of Lady Faringdon; then one from her father, which betrayed how much he was surprised and hurt that although Frances had been sent for, she had not been with his mother at her death. Then followed her mother's answer, in which she strove to exonerate herself from the charge of neglecting Lady Faringdon. Constance herself thought the excuses lame, and was not surprised that they drew from the lover a bitter reply, denying their sufficiency, and expressing his fears that she was greatly changed in character, and in her feelings toward his family and himself. Constance could see that this letter had not only been read and re-read, but wet with many a tear. It had evidently forced from her the dark secret which she had hoped to bury in her own bosom; for her answer contained an account of Lord Lowestoff's changeful, restless, moody conduct during her last visit to the Park, followed by the sudden declaration of his love, of his attempt to supplant his brother in her affections, embodying in her narrative the very words he and she herself had uttered during their last interview. The letter fell from Constance's hand. "Oh, base, mon- strous treachery 1" she exclaimed. "This, then, is the secret I This the cause which, through thirty years, estranged my father from his brother I Well did my mother call him coward!"And this act, coming now first to her knowledge, excited in her bosom an indignation much like that which had moved her mother when it was committed. She felt giddy with the strange, conflicting thoughts which crowded upon her. There at once sprang up in her an animosity against this guilty uncle, as if the offence was fresh as her knowledge of it. Yet there mingled with it a strange interest in him. She thought of him as her mother had first known him. How treach- erous was his conduct! Yet how terrible his struggles   SAINT CECIITA.        269 must have been before he yielded to the temptation!

This, then, was the cause, the just cause of a lifelong alienation I This the reason why neither her father nor mother had ever breathed to her thel name of him who was the head of the family,-lher nearest kinsman now. In the purity of her heart, in -her deep reverence for her mother, she was moved by the deepest indignation against him. But she strove to check it. "Yet this man is my uncle,-the living being nearest me in blood. God forbid that I should learn to hate him I God grant that he may have long since repelted of this wrong 1" She read no more of the letters at this time. She had already food enough for meditation. She could now trace many of the misfortunes of her parents to their alienation from him who was the head of the family, leading gradu- ally to her father's estrangement from his kinsmen and natural friends. This conduct in her uncle had imlbittered the lives of both her parents, and she resolved that, to whatever extremity she might be reduced, she would never receive aid or protection fromn tlis, her nearest kinsman. 'Yet she felt a strange interest in him, a craving to know what his intimates thought of him, and to learn some de- tails of his domestic life. He had sons and daughters; this the peerage told her. Were they not sources of hap- piness to him? Did any daughter of his resemble herself save in her misfortunes?- She might. well feel an interest in her cousins; they had never wronged her or hers. And Constance found here a fruitfull theme for meditation, and was soon busy peopling imaginary scenes with her cousins clothed in imaginced clharacteristics. She would never 23*  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7202-00000136"/> 270        SAINT CECILIA. know them, indeed; but why should that prevent her feel- ing an interest in them? But who felt an interest in her? Of all her numerous kindred, most of them in high social position, not one knew where she was.  Perhaps not one had taken the trouble to ask what had become of her. Amid the vast concatenation of human ties, ex- tending in all directions around her, she was a, solitary link; at least connected with none but those to whom chance, or her own exertions, might for a time attach her. "With a crowd of kinsmen, I am -yet truly alone in the world!"Tears filled her eyes as the images of her dead parents rose before her. "Yet, not alone,' she exclaimed, clasping her hands together, "My God is still with me!" Presently she remembered that if any of her relatives had wished to inquire after her, she had left them no trace by which they could find her. Perhaps she had erred in this. But when she remembered that both her father and mother had been for years utterly neglected by these very people, she scorned the idea of making any effort to attract their attention. But there was one person, should he re- turn to England, who might possibly inquire after her. Should she leave him without any clue by which he might trace her? And Constance blushed, and sighed, and thought -  "But it is useless to think of this. He may never return!" and here she. sighed moreddeeply. "Re- turning, after long years, he may never inquire after me. Nor," she added, raising her head proudly, " would I be willing to be found by him in my present position." Her head sunk upon her hand and she fell into medita- tion, which was interrupted by an unexpected visitor. Mrs. Stillwell, who had accompanicd her to Portsmouth on her way to Malta, now kept a small shop in the village. She was a friend of Mrs. Latimer's housekeeper, and often i   SAINT CECILIA.   '     71 came to visit her. She always inquired with interest after Constance, and sometimes asked to see her. She had now made her way to Constance's chamber, in this remote part of the house, and was welcomed there. After the first exchange of inquiries, Stillwell, contrary to her wont, be- came taciturn, and Constance had to sustain the conversa- tion. She perceived thatcher visitor had some particular object in coming. Presently. Stillwell abruptly asked, "Have you ever known a Mr. Dodsley, ma'am?" ' No. Why do you ask?"Constance said. "Because a gentleman of that name spent Sunday and part of Monday at the village inn. tIe was asking many questions about the school here. But I am satisfied that all his inquiries were aimed at you." "Indeed!" said Constance. "I am sure of it, ma'am. After making inquiries else- where he came to my little shop and bought some trifles, which I am sure he did not want. He talked about our neighborhood, inquired about Mrs. Latimer and the school, asked me if I knew any of the young ladies, and when I named you he pricked up his ears and became particular in his questions,-whether you were a parlor-boarder or a teacher, if you got any salary, if you received many letters, or any friends ever came to see after you. I let on that I was a gabbling old woman, for I wanted to find out what he was at. My talking led him to talk. He let out that he went to church both morning and evening the day be- fore on purpose to see you. I suddenly asked him how he came to know you. lie answered that your friends had got him to inquire about you. When I said that you seemed to have no friends, he answered, 'But she has relatives, and they are great folks, too.' But, finding that I was bent on questioning him lin turn, he got shy, and soon left me."  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7202-00000137"/> 272        SAINT CECILIA. "What sort of person was this inquisitive fellow?" Constance asked. "Rather a little man, under thirty, witl red whiskers, well dressed, and well spoken. He seemed to be a sort of gentleman. ' "Gentleman indeed l" exclaimed Constance, springing from her chair. It seems, then, that some of my rela- tives know where I am, and have taken this contemptible mode of inquiring about me. They cannot be as much ashamed of me as I am of them." Then, checking herself, she turned to Stillwell, and said, " ine is a strange posi- tion. I have no personal knowledge of my nearest kins- men, and they seem to fear lest I should be a burden to them. Let them be at ease on that point!-I thank you for the interest you take in me, Mrs. Stillwell. I know that you are too discreet to talk about my affairs; but pray listen and let me know when you hear of any one inquiring about me. On my way from church on Sunday morning, on looking back I observed sucll a man as you describe, some distance behind me. He followed me a good way. I wonder who this impudent fellow can be?" "I did not take him for a real gentleman, ima'ani," said Stillwell, " but some sort of an attorney---" "Am I to be watched by attorneys?" said Constance, angrily. "He let it drop from him," said Stillwell, "that some of your friends had employed him- " "The friends who take such a mode of inquiring about me are not worth my inquiring after," said Constance, haughtily. "They may be worth watching, though,"said Stillwell; and, after some further conference, she went away, leaving Constance much puzzled to imagine which of her relatives was inquiring about her, and highly indignant at the mode of doing it.

Likewise he had sons and daughters; And, as good men do, he sate At his board by these surrounded, Flourishing in fair estate."-WORDsWORTH. IT was strictly a family group which assembled around the breakfast-table at a late hour; for, just at this time, there were no guests at Felthorpe Park. Lord Faringdon himself had finished his meal, and was looking over the "Times." - But the paper did not engross his attention; for he gave an ear, and occasionally an eye, to the young people,-two sons and three daughters,-who, just from their chambers, were more occupied in conversation than with the meal before them. All of them, except the youngest daughter, who was almost a child, had returned at a late, or rather early hour, from a neighboring country- house, and as young people will dance, even in hot weather, they all wore a jaded look. "I protest, Flora," said the younger brother, a beard- less Guardsman, to his eldest sister, "I protest against your ever again imposing such a task upon me When I get at few days' leave and run down here I wish to enjoy myself in my own way.

How can you speak of my friends in that way? Is that the style of your mess-room conversation?" "But, upon my word, Flora," said Lowestoff, "that was putting Charles on hard duty." "And there is no reciprocity in Flora," said Charles. "I must dance with her friends by the half dozen,-and there she was the whole evening dodging my friend Col- ton, whom, as such, I had especially recommended to her. Always engaged when he wanted to dance with her. Colton is a capital fellow, and can make himself agreeable in spite of his ugly mug. You miglt have found time to talk to him at least, since Levenworth was absent." At this name, Lady Flora colored deeply, and her elder brother came to her rescue. "Colton is a bore, Charles, and the Wilfords are very pleasant girls. I dance with them myself sometimes." "Indeed! You are vastly condescending." Lowestoff, somewhat nettled, said, "Charles, you forget that the Wilfords are people of consequence.. The family has great weight in the county." "I do not intend to stand for the county,"7 said Charles, doggedly, as if resisting an earnest solicitation to canvass it. "If you have any such design, Lowestoff, you had better dance with the whole thirty-six feet of Wilford every time you meet them." "Or, better still," said the second sister, "Lowestoff can marry the eldest. She has the best claim by seniority." Lowestoff made a sour face, as. if the proposition was   SAINT CECILIA.        275 highly distasteful to him, and began to eat his breakfast. But the others kept up an animated dialogue, discussing  the amusing incidents of last night's party.

But, during an interval in the conversation, he returned to his newspaper. What makes him start and turn pale as he gazes on the page before him? Why does he raise the broad sheet be- tween himself and his children to conceal his agitation? Secrets are not put into the newspapers. "Died, at Malta, on the 17th, after a short illness, the Hon. Henry Guilford, Lieutenant- Colonel of her Majesty's -  th Regimlent.7 This, then, was the end of that long estrangement! Two years ago he had read a similar announcement from the same quarter, which had hardly troubled him less. Now, his brother, his only brother, the companion of his youth, alienated from him for thirty years, often in the same city with him, yet his very face unseen by him during that period,--he, too, had passed away,-and their estrange- ment was eternal. He rose from his seat with a sudden- Iess that startled the group at the table, and hastened to his own room. Something has ruffled- the governor," said the young Guardsman. "That is not the way to speak of your father, Charles," said Lady Flora, who had turned an anxious eye after Lord Faringdon as he left the apartment. -"Papa seems seriously disturbed."

Some little time elapsed before his grief and self-reproach allowed him to consider this event with calmness. In spite of their estrangement he had traced his brother's career through life closely enough to know all the chief incidents that marked it, and had reason to believe that neither that brother, nor that brother's vife, in intercourse with their associates, ever made any allusion to himself or his family. He had heard of the death of their son. lHe knew that a daughter was left them. Had they practiced with her the same contemptuous reserve as to his name? That was improbable. But had they left her ignorant of the cause of their estrangement from him, or had they poisoned her mind against him? He hoped not. He was anxious to make some reparation for his error; anxious to claim that interest in her which her orphan condition ought to excite in her nearest kinsman. Where was she?  What was her condition, and how would she receive his advances? He puzzled himself with fiuitless speculations on these points. He resolved that he would, if it were possible, induce his niece to make his house her home, even if this should be distasteful to Lady Faringdon,-and this was a bold resolution. But where was this niece? He sat down at once and wrote to an agent in London to make prompt but private inquiries, in town, and by letters to Malta, as to where she was.- But he was hardly more anxious to make known the interest he took in his brother's daughter than to conceal his utter ignorance of everything connected with her but the bare fact of her existence, and to avoid anything that might recall the recollection of his long estrangement from that brother. For this reason he did not write to the family solicitor, but to another, giving strict injunctions that inquiry should be made only through private channels, and without naming him in the matter.   SAINT CECILIA.        2" In a handsome aparthent in the most fashionable lodgings in Brighton, facing the Channel, with a gentle sea-breeze tempering the heat of the room, a party of four were seated around thll card-table. Others were present, but we deal not with them. None of our little party were young: Lieutenant-General Sir Guy Norton was seventy, and gouty; the Honorable'Mr. Russell was younger, and in better preservation, but might long ago have been a grandfather, only he had neglected matrimony; Miss Parker was a very mature lady, but matrimony had neg- lected her. The Honorable Mrs. Beresford, the youngest of the four, was a veritable grandmotlher, for this morning's mail had brought intelligence that her daughter and only child, the wife of Viscount Colbrooke, ambassador at one of the smaller German courts, had given birth to a son. But although a grandmother, Mrs. Beresford was by no means an old woman. She had not long since been hand- some, was still a stylish woman, with a good person, and dressed with exquisite taste. Three of the party were inveterate whist players; and wlist is not friendly to conversation, in which Mrs. Beres- ford excelled. She found herself out of place in this colm- pany, but could be silent on occasion. But she was proud of her promotion to the dignity of a glandmother, and seized an interval in the game to announce it to her companions, who found time to congratulate her, and to wish well to mother and child. An incipient viscount is somebody, although but four days old. Speaking of births, Mrs. Beresford," said Mr. Russell, at the next interval of the game, " reminds one of deaths. (The odd trick is ours.) And that reminds me that I have just seen the announcement of the death of Colonel Henry Guilford, at Malta. You remember him, Sir Guy?" 24  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7202-00000140"/> 278        SAINT CECILIA. "Exceedingly well," said Sir Guy. "(Mrs. Beresford, the deal is yours.) He was a lieutenant in the - th when I was lieutenant-colonel. We saw much sharp ser- vice together." "he was a handsome, dashing young fellow," said-Mr. Russell, " when I first saw him about town." "And a very pretty soldier he was," added Sir Guy. "IHe did not rise as fast as he deserved. His family seem never to have made interest for him. (What are trumps?)" "He quarrelled early with his brother, Lord Faringdon," said Mr. Russell. "Nobody knows why; and that lost him the friend most able to push him on." "Do you remember his lovely wife?" asked Sir Guy. "Her maiden name was-was---2"But here the old soldier's memory broke down. "Frances Warren," said Mrs. Beresford, gravely. "A near kinswoman of mine." And her glance wandered off from the card-table into vacancy; and her memory leapt back to the days of her girlhood. But the game grew interesting, and her partner, Mr. Russell, called her back to her cards. When the rubber was finished, and the card-party broke up, Mrs. Beresford wrote on the ivory tablets of her artificial memory two memoranda: 1. Owe Sir Guy two sovereigns. 2. What has become of Cousin Fanny's girl? The two sovereigns were duly paid Sir Guy next morn- ing. But Brighton was unusually gay just then, and, on leaving it* Mrs. Beresford had so many visits to pay to pleasant country-houses, where she met crowds of friends, that it was not until she found herself at her own country- seat in the North, and sadly in want of society and amuse- ment, that she found leisure to inquire seriously, "What has become of Cousin Fanny's girl?"

THE holidays were over. Mrs. Latimer had returned from her diplomatic tour, after confirming old friendships and making new friends. The Lodge was again crowded witl pupils, and Constance entered again on her occupa- tion, laboring hard to stimulate many a dull or indolent girl to acquire the ready and correct use of two foreign tongues. But all were not dull or indolent, and the earn- estness with which she pursued her object, and her capacity to interest her pupils, produced results very satisfactory to Mrs. Latimer and herself. Much of her leisure she devoted to painting, and she fell into the regu- lar routine of a life of labor which left little leisure for sad thoughts. She was punctual in her attendance at the parish church, and much engrossed by her devotions there. But one Sunday morning she observed that a lady who sat at some distance opposite to her seemed to be watching her closely. She was a stranger, tastefully but perhaps rather slowily dressed,-and she kept her veil down; but Con- stance became convinced that she herself was the exclusive object of this stranger's attention; for she would look another way the moment Constance looked at her. Con- stance endeavored to forget her and attend to the lservice. L1L(CLI 1/LlC/Cur vru vv rvuu rrvr rvrrr ,1,,-,M Y H--\- --  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7202-00000141"/> 280        SAINT CECILIA. But as often as her eye wandered that way, she detected, through the veil, the steady gaze of the stranger. In the evening Constance again saw her,-not in the samle pew, but still so seated that the stranger could ob- serve her well, and Constance could detect through, the veil the same steady gaze. On leaving the church, and walking toward the Lodge with Mrs. Latimer and her pupils, Constance, looking back, recognized this person following in company with the innkeeper's wife. They were looking toward Mrs. Latimer and her charge, yet talking earnestly. Constance had seen Mrs. Stillwell, in advance of the party from the Lodge, enter her cottage, which was close at hand. Letting Mrs. Latimer and the girls pass on, Constance followed Stillwell quickly into her house and took her post at the curtained window, merely saying to Stillwell, "I am watching for some one." The innkeeper's wife and her companion followed Mrs. Latimer's party but a few steps farther, and paused near Stillwell's door. The stranger had now raised her veil, and Constance eyed her attentively. She was of middle height, of a slight but graceful figure, rather overdressed. Her age was about thirty, her face pretty, with an inquisi- tive turned-up nose, a mouth trained to smiles, and sharp gray eyes, which she kept half closed, as if to conceal the searching glance she fixed on the person speaking to her. There was much play of her arched eyebrows, and some- thing graceful, but catlike and fawning, in her whole air and manner. She only asked questions, to which her com- panion gave copious replies. Constance carefully noted her features and expression with an artist's eye as the stranger faced the setting sun. She resolved that she would make an effort to discover who this person was, and why she had watched her so ,            i   SAINT CECILIA.        281 closely. Presently the pair crossed the road and turned toward the village inn.  Constance asked Stillwell whther she knew who this person was. "No, lma'am," Stillwell anwered. "But she has been here a dav or two. She says that she has a daughter whom she wishes to send to the school at the Lodge, and she has asked many questions about the school, the young ladies, and yourself in particular. But she has never been near Mrs. Latimer." "Then I did not merely imagine," said Constance, " that she watched me closely through both morning and evening service." And bidding Stillwell good-evening, she hastened to overtake Mrs. Latimer and her procession-of pupils. As soon as Constance got to her room she made a care- ful sketch of the stranger's features ere they faded from her memory, and wrote the date under the drawing. The next day, as soon as she could get rid of her French and German classes, she hastened to the village. From the small size of this place, the innkeeper's custom was not very large ; and his wife kept a small shop in a front room of the building. Constance stepped in and found her be- hind the counter. "Mrs. Bennet," said Constance, s where is your friend whom I saw with you yesterday?" Mrs. Bennet was confused at this abrupt question, but answered, "She went to London this morning, ma'anm. "I aam sorry for that," said Constance. "I meant to see her." These few and simple words, although coming from those young and beautiful lips, were uttered with an austerity of tone and air that startled Mrs. Bennet. She begtan to think that her friend had; not gone back to London too soon. She lives, then, in London?" said Constance. 24*  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7202-00000142"/> 282        SAINT CECILIA. " So she told me, ma'am." "What is her name?" "Mrs. Cleverly." "Cleverly l" re-echoed Constance. "I dare say she deserves it. But it is likely both name and residence were falsely given. What questions did she ask about me?" Mrs. Bennet started, then stammered out, "A great many, ma'am,-many more than I could answer. And- she told me a good deal about you." "Indeed!" said Constance. "   hy, she knows nothing about me, and I infer, from her conduct, never saw me before." "She seemed to know much of your friends, ma'am, and said that you might find a better home than Latimer Lodge, which she called an old rookery." "And now, Mrs. Bennet," said Constance, "you have been very free-spoken to this stranger from London, of whom you know nothing. You have to be equally free- spoken with me, and tell me all that she said and all that she asked about me, and all the answers she got." Constance drew a chair which was at hand, and reso- lutely took her seat opposite to Mrs. Bennet, who, finding herself caught gossiping, thought it best to comply with the demand made on her. So she leaned on her counter, and gave a copious but not lucid account of all her confer- ences with the stranger; and ended by finding out that she herself had told everything, and her new friend nothing. The name Cleverly, although assumed, was no misnomer. Constance perceived that this stranDger must be a person of much address; and she could only attribute to her some sinister purpose. Under plea of wishing to know some- thing of the school, she had led Mrs. Bennet and other gossips to talk of its inmates, and especially of Constance.   SA NT CECILIA.        283 She found that she had been the object of the most minute interrogatories as to her person, character, habits, attain- ments, accomplishments, her intercourse with her com- panions and their opinions of her, and what the very serv- ants at the Lodge thought of her ; that she had undergone an equally minute inspection of features, person, air, and carriage, on leaving the church both morning and evening. Yet of this inquisitor and spy she could learn nothing. She had gone off declaring that her daughter was too young for this school. Mrs. Bennet could only repeat what the woman had told her in order to mislead her. Constance left the shop greatly annoyed. Under all the disadvantages of her situation at Latimer Lodge, she had at least promised herself privacy. That she could no longer hope for. Here was a second meddlesome spy, prying into every act and condition of her life. She felt the sensation of being hunted. It was but a small conso- lation to her that Mrs. Bennet represented herself and others as having given a most favorable account of her to the last inquisitor. About this time some remarkable burglaries occurred in the county, which were much talked of in the school. At length one was perpetrated at the house of a gentleman in the neighborhood, in which his butler was dangerously wounded and other acts of violence committed. A panic spread among the girls. They could talk of nothing but the burglars, and their lessons suffered accordingly. The rumor spread that two murderous-looking ruffians had been seen that morning prowling around and reconnoitring the premises. All this was partly real terror, partly that craving for excitement of fiequent occurrence among a number of females living secluded from the world. On finding out the state of affairs, lMrs. Latimer assem- bled the whole school, and discoursed to them on the folly  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7202-00000143"/> ai        SAINT' CECILIA. of dreading burglars in a house where the family consisted of more than ninety persons. "We are living in England, not Turkey, or Persia, and need not stand in dread of-the 'Forty Thieves.' This band of burglars, if there be an organized band in the county, does not number more than three or four rogues, who take care to attack houses con- taining more wealth and fewer persons than this does." Mrs. Latimer's reference to the "Forty Thieves" proved very unlucky. Many of the younger girls had never be- fore heard of these worthies; but now they did not doubt of their existence. Had they not Mrs. Latimer's word for it? One of the elder girls, emboldened by fear, or, more likely, by love of mischief, stood forth and replied to her. "We are more than ninety, indeed, ma'am, but we are all girls and women, except the footman, who, I think, is no hero; and the old gardener's house is far from the Lodge; and many of us have jewels, that might tempt the 'Forty Thieves' to cut our throats before any help could come to us." This suggestion of wholesale slaughter redoubled the panic. Some of the teachers looked as much alarmed as the girls. Mrs. Latimer, looking round at a loss how to allay their fears, observed Constance standing near, much surprised, yet watching the various expressions of terror with the eye of an artist. "Constance," said Mrs. Latimer, aside, "you do not seem to have lost your wits. How can I calm this foolish terror?" "I know no better way, ma'am, than to make ostenta- tious preparations for defending the house. You might arm the footman, and gardener, and his assistant, and let them mount guard by turns." "Very true," said Mrs. Latimer, smiling. "You learned something while in the army. We will parade a strong guard."   "While travelling in Italy with my father," added Con- stance, "he taught me to use his pistols, and I have them with me. If I gave lessons in shooting to some of the elder girls, I think that their confidence would revive and the panic pass away." "Pray do so," said Miss Latimer, " and let us put an end to this folly." Then turning to her pupils, she said aloud, "Before night I will have a sufficient garrison to defend the house against all the burglars in H-- shire." Then she added, with a smile, "Miss Guilford having re- ceived a military education, will instruct any of the elder girls that wish it in the use of the pistol. And now go to your lessons." The gardener was despatched in haste to H---, to hire guns and pistols from a gunsmith. And Constance, calling to mind her adventure with the carbonari, sketched in chalk a life-size cartoon of the huge ruffian, with a smaller assassin at each elbow. This she pasted on the garden wall, and having got ready her pistols, after dinner she gave lessons in loading and shooting to several of the older and bolder girls, who desired to emulate their pheasant- shooting fathers and brothers in burning powder. They kept up a smart fusilade during a large part of the after- noon, and the courage and confidence of the household rose with each shot fired. The huge ruffian and his comrades were so riddled by the pistol-balls, the best aimed being by Constance's hand, that they were past hanging, and the frequent report of fire-arms was enough to deter the boldest robbers. When at night Mrs. Latimer paraded her gar- rison, well armed indeed, but unskilled in the use of arms, all dread of midnight robbery and murder had vanished.  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7202-00000144"/> 286        SAINT CECILIA. C AP TE R XXIV. "Eftsoones they heard a most melodious sound, Of all that mote delight a dainty ear, Such as at tonce might not on living ground, Save in this paradise, be heard elsewhere." THE FAEIIE, QUEENE. JUST at this-time fortune seemed bent on putting Con- stance in prominent positions, which attracted attention to her. A civil war had been for some time brewing in the parish church between the organist and the choir. Dr. Fuller had striven to quiet this dissension; but, although a good theologian, he was no musician, and utterly failed to harmonize the discord between them. One Saturday morning the mecmbers of the choir met in secret conclave and unanimously joined in a notification to the parson that he must dismiss his organist, or dispense with their services in future. They thought that another organist might be gotten at short notice, but a whole choir, and such a choir, could not be so9n replaced. Dr Fullel, too pacific to suspect the intensity of their hostility, was taken by surprise. But he did not choose to dismiss the organist at their dictation, although sorely perplexed at their desertion. In this dilemma, Mrs. Fuller suggested that some of Mrs. Latimer's young ladies were well practised in sacred music, and might be useful in this emergency. "You know, doctor, people will make allowances for their youth and the novelty of their situation." The parson and his wife at once posted off to the Lodge and sought an interview with Mrs. Latimer. As that lady always treated the clergy in general, and Dr. Fuller   SAINT CECILIA.        287 in particular, with distinguished consideration, he made his request with some confidence. But Mrs. Latimer had not forgotten the low 'estimate Mrs. Fuller had put upon the musical proficiency of her pupils, nor forgiven the un- favorable comparison she had drawn between them and the church choir. She rejoiced in the humiliation of the parson and the parson's wife, now come to beg the aid of her unvalued choristers. But she enjoyed this satisfaction in her secret heart, without betraying the least sign of triumph. She was not unwilling to bestow favors. In- deed, she enjoyed doing so when they cost her nothing. But she always liked to make them felt, and have them acknowledged. With the full intention of granting their petition, she raised many difficulties. She doubted whether the young ladies' fathers and mothers would approve of their taking places in the choir. There was a publicity about it that gave it a professional air. If they undertook this duty they would be bound to keep their appointment, and might expose themselves in bad weather, take cold, endanger their health, or lose their voices forever, and she made sundry other objections, and then hastened to over- come them. For'they were all men of straw, set up solely for the purpose of beating them down in her zeal as a de- vout daughter of the true church, for which she would make any sacrifice. Then, sending for Constance and her music class, Mrs. Latimer puft the case so strongly to them as a religious' duty, and talked so learnedly of the harp of David, of Miriam, the prophetess, with her timbrel in her hand, and other illustrations of their obligation to raise their tuneful voices in glorifying God, that they, nothing loath, consented to supply the place of the apos- tate musicians. The parson, delighted with Mrs. Latimer's piety and eloquence, and at his own success, hastened home to send the organist to the Lodge with the music  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7202-00000145"/> 288       SAINT CECILIA. for the next day, and Constance and her companions spent Saturday evening in practising what they were to perform on Sunday. How far devout impulses influenced the young choris- ters we do not know. But the motives Mrs. Latimer ex- pressed so eloquently, Constance felt quite as strongly. To consecrate her vocal powers by glorifying her Maker, Saviour, and the Shepherd-of her soul was no mere pas- time, but fast becoming a solemn duty with her, and the feeling with which she sung had a contagious influence over her companions. The next morning all the members of the rebellious choir punctually attended at the church to enjoy the em- barrassment of the organist and his patron. But they were grievously disappointed. Constance's pupils formed a well-trained choir, with not a few good voices in it; yet they were almost lost in the volume of her own rich tones, which bad an elastic and expansive power that at once adapted itself to the size of the building to be filled. Her first notes thrilled through the congregation with startling effect, which almost disturbed the decorum of public wor- ship. The organist, no mean musician, sustained her with enthusiasm; her voice, although supreme, was not alone, allowing its part to the accompanying choristers; and Mrs. Latimer looked proudly round as if to saiy ( This is the way we do things at Latimer Lodge." We have the highest authority for believing that devo- tion often appropriately and naturally takes the form of music in addressing God. But in the purest church, among the least contaminated congregation of the faithful, the devil artfully secures some little corner for himself. Sometimes he sits in the pew of the lord of the manor, sometimes on the bench of the pew-opener, at times intrudes even into the chancel and the pulpit; but his favorite post   SAINT CECILIA.        289 is the choir. He is most at,home there. In truth, we would not look there for the purest and most fervent piety. ,The pride of art, the rivalry of skill, the distraction of per- forming a technical and professional part, that somewhat sensuous perception of melody and harmony, which con- stitute the musical temperament, all tend to shut out those emotions from which alone sacred music should draw its inspiration. Constance, gazing round on her companions, looking into her own heart, saw and felt this. She felt how easily she might be beguiled and misled by the song- stress's pride of art, and of the peculiar gift with which God had endowed her, $nd she strove to humble herself as the frail and sinful creature called upon to, raise her voice in'the praise, and in the presence of her Creator. The new part she had undertaken made little change in her habits. Once in the week she led her choir to the parisl church, where, shutting themselves up with the organist, they practised the music for the next Sunday. We do not know whether the people of the neighborhood became more devout; but Dr. Fuller saw his congrega- tion swell largely in numbers. Iis own parishioners be- canm punctual, and neighboring parishes contributed their quotas of straggling devotees. rhe parson bestirred him- self to select his best sermons, and even to write new ones, and to preach them with the revived fervor of his vigorous days, to the edification of so goodly, if not godly, an assem- bly. Mrs. Latimer was delighted at the skill and fame of lher choristers; for she could have found no more effecctual way of calling attention to the admirable system of train- ing at Latimer Lodge. This proficiency in music, directed to its sacred use, wans but a sample of her system and her success. She knew it was easier to win favor and con- fidence by tickling peoples ears than by convincing their understandings. 25  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7202-00000146"/> 290        SAINT CECILIA.

Wildly here without control, Nature reigns and rules the whole; In that sober pensive mood, Dearest to the feeling soul, She plants the forest, pours the flood."-BURNs. CONSTANCE had now been more than a year at the Lodge without leaving it; but her love of nature, and of the ,picturesque often awakened a craving for a change of scene. She often looked out of her window with eager eyes on the blue mountains of Radnorshire, longing to ex- plore their recesses and wondering what new phases of living or inanimate nature she might find there with which to store her sketch-book. She was much delighted when, on the occurrence of a week's holiday, Miss Ap-Rice urged her to go with her to her father's vicarage, only twenty miles distant. They were to return before Sunday; for Constance, always ready to assume duties, now made a point of fulfilling punctually her volunteer service as leader of the choir. They set out the next morning in an equipage which was rude to rusticity; and only escaped the ridicule of the more fashionable young ladies by driving off while the latter were still at lbreakfast. It waS a humble sample of the spring-cart, drawn by the vicar's old mare Molly, and driven by a clownish ploughboy, who, as they made slow progress along the hilly road, scolded at her vociferously   SAINT CECILIA.        291 in Welsh, but showed little command of English. But Constance, seated on this rude vehicle, escaping for some days from the monotony of the Lodge, and of her tasks tlere, was delighted at the sense of freedom she had not ,lately felt. She gazed with keen interest on each new scene presented to her, and often called her companion's attention to some new object. But she met with little sympathetic feeling in Miss Ap-Rice, who was but the well-drilled teacher of the ordinary branches of education. Slow in intellect, and not acute in sensibility, she was' utterly without that suggestive imagination which height- ens all the pleasures and pains of intellect and of sense., She loved her home and those she was going to meet there. She greeted each well-known object on the road as marking her nearer approach to the vicarage. But when Constance called her attention to the changing features of Cader Edow, whose flank they were slowly climbing, her only answer was, "Yes, it is an ugly hill; and Molly will be sorely worried before she gets on the other side of it." To her Cader Edow was but an obstacle between herself and her home  An acute traveller has remarked that in the midst of the grandeur of their mountain scenery, the Swiss are the most, unimaginative people' in Europe. Amid the beautiful and romantic scenery of Wales, occa- sion may be found for a like remark on the Welsh. Miss Ap-Rice was much surprised when, at the most difficult point, a narrow pass which afforded a charming vista of the broken country beyond it, Constance insisted on stopping the cart and getting out; then seating her- self on the roadside, she made a careful sketch of the scene before her. Only one other member of the party approved of this halt. When the ploughboy had chocked the wheel withl a large stone, Molly drew back fronl her collar, and breathed at her ease, to prepare herself for the toil of surmounting the " ugly hill " before her.  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7202-00000147"/> 292       SSAINT CECILIA. Although more than once delayed by Constance's sketching propensity, they at last reached the vicarage hungry and tired. It was a humble dwelling, but Con-  stance was heartily welcomed there. Mr. Ap-Rice was a widower, with several daughters younger than Constance's companion. He had made great sacrifices to educate her at so expensive a school as Mrs. Latimer's, partly in the hope that her younger sisters might profit by her instruc- tions. These motherless girls certainly stood in great need of training, and the father had as much the air of a peasant as of a clergyman. It had not always been so with him. But he had long been obliged to eke out a poor living by the toilsome cultivation of some acres of glebe land. In the course of her short visit, Constance saw that his few cows and sheep occupied quite as much of his time as his Christian flock. Nor was this a neglect of duty. His was one of the many cases in the church in which the laborer is not thought worthy of his hire; and he had urgent occasion to keep in mind the text, " le that provideth not for his own household hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel." Constance had now an opportunity of observing rustic life in a region that was new to her; yet there was not much in the household to interest her greatly. But her olbject had been to escape for a few days from her laborious and monotonous life at the Lodge, and to fill her sketch- book with materials and hints from nature for the art to which she had given so much labor. The few days she passed here were chiefly spent in rambling about the neighborhood under the guidance of one or more of the sisters, who liked rambling well, but by no means appre- ciated her enthusiasm in her art, except when employed in depicting some living object well known to them, as their favorite dun cow, which gave so much milk, or the bell-wether of the vicar's small flock.   SAINT CECILIA.        293 In conversing with Mr. Ap-Rice, Constance found that this rustic parson was not without his troubles and anx- ieties as to the spiritual condition of his parish. The people were most of them Welsh in race and language, and hung very loose upon the church. The ranting enthusiasm of Methodist exhorters of the most ignorant class was more attractive to most of them than the church's solemn and instructive services and rites. He complained too of a laxity of morals and grossness of habits that defied refor- mation. Finding Constance an earnest and intelligent listener, in his eager denunciation of the licentiousness of the rustic population (for Arcadia is but a poet's dream), he forgot the age and sex of his auditor, going into par- ticulars ill-suited to her ears. Thus he lamented that the custom, known in old times in Scotland as " handfast- ing," was still prevalent in his neighborhood , and his revelations of other laxities were only checked by seeing how much shocked she was at their being made to her. This conversation alone was enough to convince- Con- stance that she lad fallen among very coarse people. But one day more remained for exploring this picturesque neighborhood; and Constance induced Miss Ap-Rice to go out with her on a somewhat distant excursion. In the course of the morning shec led her companion over so much rough ground that, in spite of the fiequent pauses in order to sketch noteworthy objects, Miss Ap-Rice was almnost worn out when they turned toward home. They had just issued from a rocky glen, which they hald been exploring, following downward a mountain torrent from leap to leap, and were now on the public road lead- ing down from Cader Edow, and had nearly reached a path leading over the hills to the vicarage, when they heard horses' feet, and loud talking and laug'hinl, behind them. On loo(king back' they sa'w a mounltd party, three 25*  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7202-00000148"/> 294       SAINT CECILIA. ladies and four or five ,entlemen, coming- after them. As they dre\ nearer, Miss Ap-Rice said, "This is Miss Meredith with a party from Llangynnoc House."' The two walkers had just reached the path when the riders overtook them; and Constance, wishing to see what change three years had wrought in her former companion, stopped on the bank overhanging the road and gazed at the party. Miss Meredith rode foremost with a gentleman by her side, to whom she was talking with great volubility. She was capitally mounted, and sat her horse well. She wore a handsome riding-dress, setting off a plump and well- formed person, and a beaver hat with ostrich plumes over- shadowing it. With her rich brunette complexion and her dark eyes, in high health, animated by exercise and con- versation, she was a striking figure with a dashing air. Constance muttered, "Now, at length, I would like to take her likeness, as she is, and in the saddle." While she gazed steadily on her, Miss Meredith suddenly recognizing her, started, colored, and looked away. But the moment after she rallied, and turning her head, stared haughtily at Constance, with the evident resolve not to shun her eye, nor yet to recognize her; and Constance saw glide over her face the same triumphant, malignant look which had of old startled herself and the mantua maker. As the riders swept by, Miss Meredith said somethng to her at- tendant beau, pointing with her whip over, her shoulder at Constance; and each of the party turned to look at her as they passed. Standing on the bank within a few yards of them, gazing on them with grave face and earnest eyes, her cheeks flushed at the incident of meeting Miss Meredith, she was truly an attractive object; and that young lady regretted having called the attention of her companions to her.   SAINT CECIIA.        295 As the riders passed on, the last gentleman, who had no lady to escort, dropped behind them and gazed back at Constance. He had marked Miss Meredith's contemptuous air as she pointed her whip at her. When he saw her turn with her companion to take the path over the hill he followed them. Constance was walking on, nleditating on the painful exhibition of character made by Miss Meredith, when Miss Ap-Rice, hearing the sound of a horse's feet, turned and saw him. She exclaimed, in a tone of alarm, "He is following us 1" and tried to hurry Constance on; but Consta nce would not be hurried, and he came up to them. This gentlenan was young and good-looking, but had a dissolute and presuming air. Taking off his hat with a politeness strongly tinged with familiarity, he said, "Young ladies, you may lose your way in these wild hills, let me be your guide and escort." Whle her companion shrunk behind her for protection, Constance turned and confronted him, sternly saying, "Sir, you egregiously lost your way when you presumed to follow us. Your road lies there! Follow it 1"And she pointed with imperious gesture to the receding )party. Had Mrs. Siddons heard her tones, seen her proud attitude, the flashing eye, the scornful lip, the commanding' gesture of that outstretched arm, she would have embraced her as her sister and her peer. The obtrusive gallant dropped his glances to the ground, the air of insoleht familiarity falded froml his face, and turning his horse, he rode crest- fallen after his party. Miss Ap-Rice, recovering from her alarm, was full of exclamations at Miss Meredith's pride and insolence; and wondered what the gentleman meant in riding after them. She recognized him as a young man of good family in the county, but noted for his loose morals and dissolute habits;  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7202-00000149"/> 29G        SAINT CECILIA. and she repeated several stories of him which had better been left untold. Constance said little during the walk home, and she kept in front of her companion to hide some tears that fell. A painful train of thought had possession of her. She had suffered too many mortifications of late. She had not been accustomed to meet with indications of a want of personal respect to herself. Miss Meredith's insolence in utterly ignoring her former room-mnate and constant companion did not surprise, but it mortified, her. The yet more insolent conduct of a dissolute young m1an, in attempting to thrust himself familiarly upon her, was still more mortifying. The coarse habits and sentiments of the family she was visiting were highly distasteful to her. She now rmemlbered the inquisitive suspicion to'which she lhad been subjected in London by the people of the boarding-house, the jeweller, and the picture-dealer. She recalled the anxious warning of the old attorney, and perceived that she stood alone in the world without any definite social position, with no means of commanding the respect to which she felt herself entitled. Latimer Lodge was the only place at which she could assure herself of a respectable home; and even themre she had been the object of mysterious cspionage by the secret agents of she knew not whom. She lad been obliged, through no fault of her own, to veil her pride and sink from a parlor-boarder to that of an assistant teacher, who was not even paid for her labor. Reluctant as she was to own it, she was altogether dependent on Mrs. Latimer for her social position. She strove not to repine, but felt that one, of the hardest tasks which can be imposed upon us is to humble ourselves, as Christians, in suibmis- sion to God's dispensations which lower our worldly posi- tion, without yielding to the influences which tend to de- grade us among our fellows. Proud and ambitious i)b   ,SAINT CEGILIA.        297 nature, she found herself exposed to severe trials by adverse fortune. She felt that she was qualified to fill a high position, yet found herself subjected to obscurity and humiliation. It was not without many a sigh and tear, , and many a longing look toward the high and sunny places of the earth, that she bowed her head in resignation. "Whatever lot may be appointed me, let nme pray for strength to fulfil my duties in it. I am not deserted while my God is still with me." The next morning the spring-cart, and Molly, and the Welsh ploughboy were again on the road, carrying Con- stance and Miss Ap-Rice back to Latimer Lodge, the sight of which \was hailed by Constance with a satisfaction that seemed strange even to herself. But the experience and the reflections of the last few days had taught her to look to it, if not as a scene of happiness, yet as a shelter from evils, which she might otherwise have to face unfriended in this hard, cold world; and to look upon its mistress as a safe and useful friend, on whatever motives her friend- ship might be founded. On the evening of her return, Mrs. Latimer was reading a London journal; for, busy as she was, she was careful to keep up with the world outside of Latimer Lodge. Presently she said, " ere is intelligence that may interest you, Constance. 'Now that London is dull and empty, that distinguished maestro and musician, Levison, has taken with him several musical celebrities on a tour of mingled pleasure and business. After visiting many attractive points in Wales, he will delight the lovers of music in the chief towns in the west by a series of concerts.'" ' I would like much to hear them," said Oonstance. "I am afraid that unless we give him a special invita- tion," said Mrs. Latimer, laughing, "hie will forget to stop at Orton in his tour."  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7202-00000150"/> 298        SAINT CECILIA.

Sure something holy lodges in that breast, And with these raptures moves the vocal air To testify his hidden residence. How sweetly did they float upon the wings Of silence through the empty, vaulted roof." MASQUE OF COMUS. A FORTNIGHT had passed since Constance had returned from the Welsh vicarage. It was Sunday morning, but the winid blew in gusts, the rain poured down in torrents, and Dr. Fuller had a poor prospect of assembling many of his congregation in the parish church, when two travelling carriages drove up to the little inn at Orton. From the first and larger carriage alighted two gentlemen and two ladies. The ladies were rather showily dressed for trav- ellers, and something in the air and costume of the gentle- men indicated that they did not belong to any of the graver' professions, but followed some calling which had for its object the amusement of their fellow-men. As soon as they spoke, it was obvious that sonie of the party were foreigners. They must have risen early and travelled far; for, on being shown into the parlor while the horses were baited, they called vociferously for the best the house afforded, especially including claret and fresh eggs, and went vigor- ously to work to break their fast, talking and laughing much all the while. Meanwhile a single person got out of the other carriage and took his seat at the same table with them. He could   SAINT CECILIA.        299 scarcely be said to join their party, for he seemed much abstracted, taking little part in the conversation. He ate a single egg, and drank but one gliss of claret, making a grimace not complimentary to the vintage. When the occupants of the first carriage, having taken their case at the inn, were preparing to resume their journey, he loitered behind them and-called the landlord to him. The stranger was a man above forty, of good stature, plump in person, indeed rath!er corpulent, and exceedingly well dressed. He had a rich complexion, rather brown than fair, a broad, manly face, a smooth but thoughtful brow, keen, vigilant eyes, and a nose somewhat aquiline. He would have been handsome but for his thick lips and the voluptuous and animal expression of the lower part of his face. His hands were-white, smooth, and plu)mp, with very long fingers. He was graceful and self-possessed in manner and smooth in speech, with a rich, sonorous voice. His whole appearance was imposing; yet one accustomed to good society would not mistake him for a person of high birth. An undefinable epicurean air pervaded the whole man. As he was paying the bill for the whole party, his ser- vant brought to him from the carriage a large prayer-book very richly bound, and he said to the landlord, "I have been compelled; very reluctantly, to travel to-day, but will stop long enough to attend service at the parish church. The rain seems to have held up, and I hear the church bell. Pray, point out the driest path to it." The landlord stepped out into the road and pointed out the way to this devout stranger, who, armed with his handsome prayer-book, marched to the sound of the bell, picking his way, catlike, between the puddles. He soon reached the church, and found three elderly men standing under the belfry. While one was ringing the bell they i  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7202-00000151"/> 300        SA NT C ECILIA. were all looking disconsolately out, apparently at a coming shower. The youngest of them, but the first in dignity, was the organist; the second, the clerk, and the third, a bald, red- faced old fellow, who spent six days in the Week hammer- ing at his anvil, but, having a taste for music, took his exercise on Sunday in blowing the organ bellows. 'I hope we will have service here this morning," said the stranger, blandly. Hie seenled fearful of being disap- pointed of his devotions. The clerk looked respectfully at the large and handsome prayer-book, and said, "Certainly, sir; St. Mary's, Orton, is closed for no weather." "And if our choir does not fail us, sir," added the organ- ist, "you shall hear some rare music." I trust they will not," said the stranger, earnestly, and his eyes turned in the direction to which the three church officials were looking, down the road which led to Latimer Lodge. "Here comes Miss Guilford, the short way, across the field," exclaimed the bellows-blower. "But she comes alone." "' We can do without the others," said the organist; "for she is the choir." The stranger now saw a lady walking very fast across a field to the west of the church. She was closely fol- lowed by a heavy shower. As sle entered the church- yard the stranger withdrew into the church, but took his stand behind one leaf of the folding-door, so that he could inspect the person wloml the organist had dubbed "the choir." The rain beginning to fall heavily, she ran liglitly up the gravel-path, and sprang into the belfry, panting from her hurried walk from the Lodge.  Her coming seemed to shed light and life on the old men who had been   SAINT CECIL A.        301 looking out for her, and they smiled brightly and bowed low in answer to her kindly "Good-morning." Shaking the rain-drops from her bonnet, she threw off her shepherd's-plaid shawl, and the hiding stranger was struck with her fine person and graceful movement. "Is Dr. Fuller in the vestry-room?" she asked. "Iie has been there some time," the clerk answered. "Our choristers have deserted us, Mr. Nealc," she said to the organist. "I will not call the young ladies fair- weather-Christians, for Mrs. Latimer would not let them conie out this wet morning. You and I must see how we can do without them." "We can do very well without them," answered the organist. " ery well without them," echoed the clerk. "Well without them," re-echoed the bellows-blower. And the first and last followed Miss Guilford up to the organ-loft. The congregation was, indeed, scanty. The church was almost empty, 1and the stranger could choose his seat with reference to the besst point for hearing prayer, sermon, or psalmody. lie chose one behind a massive pier, somewhat out of the way of observation, with his face half turned to the organ-loft. Ilc was very attentive and devout during the first part of the service, and repeated the confession with all the external marks of a genuine penitent sinner; his rich sonorous voice affording an imposing echo to the parson's words. But during the chanting of the "Venite e iultemus Doming," he kept his seat, and seemed to be so much moved by it that, when it closed, he forgot to open his huge prayer-book and follow the solemn words of the service. But his attention was presently aroused, and his responding voice was heard in the psalms. Whenever the choir" chanted or sung, he kept his seat, and any one 26  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7202-00000152"/> 302        SAINT CECILIA who could have overlooked the high back of that old- fashioned pew, might have seen his long forefinger keep- ing time, like the leader's wand in an orchestra, and mark- ing the most exquisite passages with an ecstatic flourish. Had the adjacent pew had an occup'ant, he would have heard, at times, the soft "Brava! Brava I Bravissinma  forced from him when some peculiar artistic flourish, or some passage of more exquisite melody, thrilled upon his ear. In the organ-loft, hidden by the curtains from all eyes but those of her choristers, Constance was in the habit of yielding to her histrionic impulse to act what she sung. Now, with no one near her but the old organist, whose1 back was turned to her, she threw the reins loose to her enthusiasm. During the voluntary, preceding the psall, the stranger fixed his eye upon the curtain that concealed the singer. As she opened with the line "Ye boundless realms of joy! lie saw two fair hands raised in graceful, earnest invoca- tion above the envious barrier which concealed their owner. Again, as she dwelt upon the line "And clouds that float in liquid air," he saw a single hand floating with magic grace in vacancy, and he perceived that, from a natural, uncontrollable im-r pulse, the inspired songstress expressed in action, as with her voice, the emotions of her heart. Too soon the voice ceased, and the organ sank into silence. The stranger drew a deep breath, then vented his emotion in a sigh. This was not the style of music he was most accustomed to, or would have chosen; yet it moved him powerfully, perhaps the more from being comparatively a novelty to him. He looked around and took I   SAINT OECILIA.        3f03 in at a glance of the eye and the mind all that surrounded him. The gloomy day and moaning wind without; the dark nave, the solemn aisles, the massive piers of the old church, mnore impressive firom the irregularities and various dates of its architecture, the monumental memorials of past generations, with mysterious lights streaming upon them from the many-colored stained-glass windows; tle gray-headed priest, and the solemn words he uttered; the few but earnest worshippers bowed down in reverence; the great God himself, unseen, unknown in all his attri- butes, yet strongly imagined by undoubting faith,-all contributed to the fitness of the occasion and the place for pouring forth this heavenly melody. To his artistic per- ceptions the whole dranlatic effect was faultless, match- less. It called into activity every devout emotion within him; for melodious notes were the language of his adora- tion, and music was his god! It was only by an effort that the stranger observed a de- vout decorum during the remaining prayers. He often forgot his large prayer-book, and responded to few of the ten collnnlandmencnts,-perhaps he, preferred not to hear solme of them ; but the chants and the hymn wrapped him in Elysium. His flashing eye, the tremulous play of his lips, his long forefinger, perfect in its time but varying in its flourishes, betrayed his ecstasy.  He sat in deep thought during the sermon, but whenever he chanced to look up, his eye glanced toward the organ- loft, not the pulpit. As soon as the service was over, before the last notes of the organ had died away, he seized his hat and prayer-book, and, gliding through a side door, hastened out of the church. Then moving with an alert- ness unusual in so portly a personage, he passed out of the churchyard, across the road, and into the field opposite, following the path by which Miss Guilford had come.  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7202-00000153"/> 304        SAINT CECILIA. When he had crossed the stile on the other side of the field, he-sought a thick place in the hedge and posted himself there. Presently Constance, who had stopped to a.,y a few words to Dr. Fuller, entered the field and walked swiftly toward the Lodge. The stranger now drew out an opera- glass of high powers, and reconnoitred her with vigi- lant and experienced eyes. He watched. her swift and graceful steps as she advanced, measured her stature with his eye, admired her stately bearing, and. cursed the heavy shawl which concealed the proportions of her form. As she drew nearer he could distinguish her features well. A noble, pensive face, now lighted up with cheerful thoughts, a cheek, usually somewhat pale from confinement, now flushed by exercise. Soon her keen eye distinguished a man behind the hedge, with his hands raised to his lIead. She wondered why he was there and what he could he doing. As she crossed the stile at some distance from him, he drew behind a bushy thorn, which half concealed him, and continued his observation of her. Constance turned as she passed on, and, in spite of his effort at con- cealment, distinguished a portly, well-dressed man gazing steadily at her through an opera-glass. "Who can this inquisitive and impudent fellow be?" She looked back again at hini. he was utterly unknown to her; and with a proud toss of the head and a glance of scorn, she passed swiftly on toward Latimer Lodge. When she was out of sight the stranger came out of the hedge, closed his, lorgnette, and shaking off the rain-drops he had gathered from the thorn bush, he exclaimed, "Capital I capital! That queenlike glance of scorn almost crushed me. A light step, a graceful carriage, a noble air, a lovely face, and such a voice, so full, sweet, and flexible What a prima donna lies buried in that musty old mansion! It is   SAINT CECILIA.        305 literally throwing pearls before swine. What know these rustics of 1music?" He now walked back into the village, and when he reached the inn, went at once into the kitchen. Calling for his servant to wipe his clothes and bring him a pair of dry boots, he toasted himself on all sides before the fire, as a precaution against any possible evil resulting from his unwonted exposure.  While making himself comfortable he ordered the horses put to his carriage; then fell into conversation with the innkeeper, who expressed a hope that the stranger had been gratified in attending service at the parish church. "Auch gratified," he answered. "You appear to have an able and estimable old rector; and I heard some excel- lent music." The landlord at once opened in praise of Miss Guilford, admitting to this devout stranger that she had imade hibm more punctual at church than he had ever been in his life. "And pray who is Miss Guilford?" the stranger, asked. Is she a young lady of birth and fortune?" "She is said to be of a noble family, but can have no fortune. At least she is now a teacher of languages at the Lodge." "A teacher of languages I Modern languages? Per- haps she was educated abroad." "So they say," the innkeeper answered. "It is also said that she is niece, or something of that sort, to Lord Faringdon." "Is she much with Lord Faringdon's 'family?" "I have never heard that they took any notice of her." A ha!" said the stranger to himself, "I begin to under- stand the matter. Lord Faringdon was a gay man in his youth, and lived much abroad. Doubtless he found pleasant company there. This young lady probably has claiml upon 26*  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7202-00000154"/> 306        SA INAT CECILIA. him which he would not make known to his wife and daughters. He has had her highly educated, as he was bound to do, brought her to England, bred her up as a lady, and now she is without any definite social position; and he does not know what to do with her. Verily, my lord is in a dilemma,' he added, shaking his head. "But it is in my power to help him, and her, and myself into the bargain.' Then addressing the landlord, he asked, "What is the young lady's Christian name?" "Constance. Miss Constance Guilford." The stranger repeated the name more than once to him- self, then muttered, "I am not likely to forget it." The servant now announced that the carriage was at the door; and the innkeeper waited on his important and devout guest up to the moment of his departure. The servant mounted the box, the stranger stepped into, the carriage, and the innkeeper shut the door on hinl; but not before he remarked a curious piece of machinery, which puzzled hini exceedingly. The Buddhists have their praying machines of various patterns and powers. Sonie are kept in devout activity by running streamus, others grind out their prayers im- pelled by the winds of heaven, and smaller ones depend for their praying power on the hand of the believer. The solitary occupant of the carriage Was somewhat similarly provided. Before him, on the front seat, was placed a machine with keys like those of a piano-forte, but without the means of producing- the sounds which usually accom- pany them. A musical library filled the box under the seat. Drawing out a volume of church music, he spread it open on the stand; and the road being smooth, and the occasion favorable for the exercise of his devout impulses, he began to finger away at his praying mnachine, while he hummed one of those solemn anthems which he had latelv   SAINT CECILIA.        307 heard, striving to recall to his imagination the thrilling intonations of the gifted songstress. Nearly a week had passed, and Constance no longer thought of the inquisitive stranger who had so persever- ingly brought his lorgnetle to bear upon her, when she received the following letter. Like all letters arriving at the Lodge, it passed through Mrs. Latimer's hands, and she could hardly restrain her strong curiosity to know its contents; but Constance carried it unopened to her room. "TO MSS CONSTANCE GUILFORD, LATIMER LODGE, ETC. "MY DEAR Miss GUILJrFRD,-TWhile on a tour in tie West, hearing accidentally of your vocal powers, I last Sunday attended service at the parish church of St. Mary's, Orton. "The inclemency of the weather, which compelled you to supply the place of your absent choir, afforded me the best opportunity of hearing you. I was more than gratified,- I was delighted. To a musician like yourself my name may not be unknown. This imboldcns me to urge you not to remain longer buried in obscurity. You possess other gifts to set off your musical talents, and I am in a position to bring you out to the greatest advantage. After a short period of instruction in a different and higher style of music than that which you have cultivated so success- fully, I will engage to insure you not only a national but a European reputation. Powers not greater than yours have often led tofalme, wealth, and a high alliance. With my aid you can speedily issue fromn obscurity, shake off the acci- dent of birth, and take the eminent place to which your gifts entitle you. If you will refer me to an agent authorized to act for you, I am ready to enter into an engagement which I trust will be satisfactory to yoursclf and him. "I remain, with the highest respect and admiration, yours,               "I. LEVISON."  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7202-00000155"/> 308       SAINT CECILTA. Constance recognized the name of the noted musician and composer, a notice of whose movements Mrs. Latimer had read to her from the London journal. She was much astonished at the tenor of his letter. "' Instruction in a higher style of music!'" she repeated. "'A European repu- tation ' 'Engagement satisfactory to yourself and him!' What have I done, that this man dare propose to me to become an opera singer?"She threw the letter on the floor, and planted ler foot firmly on it. But presently she withdrew it. "There was little of Christian humility in that act," she said. "The man means no offence. Music is his profession, and he can conceive of no higher ambi-  tion than success and fame in his peculiar art." She stooped, and taking up the letter, read it carefully over. "Shake off the accident of birth?" she repeated, not sus- pecting, in her innocence, the maestro's not unnatural suspicion as to her origin. "He seems aware that this would be a very unusual step, in one of my birth, and that in this case I must indeed stoop to rise! Yet what is my position now? The plodding assistant in a pro- vincial school,-drilling unwilling girls in the elements of modern tongues,-toiling in secret in my leisure hours to earn a few guineas by painting second-rate--perchance third-rate-pictures. Even their small merit brings no reputation to the unknown artist. What have I to look forward to? A friendless life of obscurity and labor." She again looked at the letter. "If I am so highly endowed with this fascinating gift,-and no better judge of that can be found than this man,-if I have other personal endowments to set off and sustain my vocal powers" (what lovely woman is ignorant of her attrac- tions?), "fame and wealth are within my reach, and, in sonme sense, eminent position." She strode up and down her room, tremulous with agitation and enthusiasm. The   SAINT CECILIA.        309 walls of her narrow chamber vanished, and a wide and magnificent scene opened before her. Hundreds of bril- liant lights illuminating architectural grandeur, gorgeous coloring, and courtly robes, flashed upon her. The grand theatre of, San Carlo, of Naples, was around her. Thou- sands of eager faces were turned upon her,-the central object to thrilling ears, delighted eyes, and applauding hands. But the audience was not Neapolitan. Her own countrymen were around her,-the choice seats occupied by her own kindred, unconscious of the ties of blood which bound them to the unknown siren, enchanting them with her grace and beauty, as with her song. But she did not suffer this vision to entrance her long.. She passed her hands over her eyes, and the whole expression of her face was altered. "God throws around us the customs, the very prejudices of the world, as a shield against the dangerous propensities to which our hearts lie open. Iad I been born some steps lower in the social scale I could hardly have escaped this dangerous snare. Were I mad enough to accept this offer, and encounter the deteriorating, the enslaving influence of such a career, I could not long conceal my real name. Whatever wrong my uncle may have done to me and mine, however for- gotten I may be by proud and prosperous kinsmen, what right have I to remind them of my existence by briinglng mortification upon them? My father I My mother! With wlat horror would they have looked for- ward to such an end to their care, their anxieties, and  hopes!" With a startled look, she added, "When the meddlesome, mercenary, malignant press, disseminating each notoriety throughout the world, shall carry to tlat distant Eastern land its fulsome or impudent conlents on my career, my character, my name; when, pausing amid daring enterprise and lofty aims, he shall ask tidings  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7202-00000156"/> 310       SAINT CEBLIIA. from our common home, what would he think of -me? What would I think of myself?" She threw the letter from her as if steeped in con- tagious poison, and sitting down, at once wrote this an- swer to it: "SIR,--I will not attribute to sinister motives your much- mistaken letter to me. You are wrapped up in your art, and know no ambition beyond it. But your views are not mine. My birth, my education, my views of duty, my hopes in life, here and hereafter, forbid my entering on the dangerous path you would open to me. The gifts that God bestows on us we are indeed bound to use. But I feel that I put mine to its highest use when I consecrate it to His praise. "Respectfully yours, "CONSTANCE GUILFORD." When she had written this letter she felt a sense of re- lief, a mind calmed and steadied in the path of duty, She blushed that such a proposition had been made her, and yet more that it should have misled her imagination for a moment. Anxiety to guard the secrecy of this coriespond- ence fromn the possibility of discovery led her to intrust her answer to no hand until she herself had dropped it in the village post-office.

"And as a pilgrim, when he rests Within the temple of his vow, looks round In breathless awe, and hopes some time to tell Of all its goodly state."--CAR;Y's DANTE; THS correspondence with the maestro, brief as it was, made a deep impression on Constance. She had under- gone a mental struggle which she was hardly willing to acknowledge to herself. Yet it turned her mind to sad and serious thoughts. She now saw that she must not hope to choose her path in life, but should rather follow faithfully that which God had marked out for her. She turned to Latimer Lodge as her home for an indefinite period; to her occupations there as the duties set before her; to the large houselold there assembled, as the group out of which she must choose her companions and her friends. She thankfully acknowledged the security of her life there, and the blessings within her reach. Even Mrs. Latimer, with all her faults, was in some sense a safe friend, who had learned to value her, and manifested an affection for her. Constance's heart opened to each kindly demonstration her own kindly temper called forth, and they were not few. Could she but forget, could she shut out some bright visions of the past, some hopes once fondly cher- ished, now faded to the shadow of a shade, she might find in Latimer Lodge a blessed house of refuge and a homle. She returned with renewed ardor to her labors with the pencil; for her artistic impulses and her high aspirations  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7202-00000157"/> must find a vent; and even if she should not rise to emin nence in art, she was confident that by it she could main- tain herself above want. She would content herself in the humble station to which God, in his providence, had reduced her. But the artist is the student and interpreter of nature. In his studio he seeks to embody the conceptions suggested by his intercourse with the world without. Constance at ' times felt cramped by the limited fields of observation in nature and art afforded by the Lodge and its neighbor- hood. She remembered the long, solitary vacations she had spent there, and cast about for some means of avail- ing herself of the leisure of the next holidays to vary the monotonous tenor of her life. But where can she go? With whom can she associate beyond the narrow circle in which her lot is cast? Her youth, her sex, her desti- tution of social ties, trammelled her adventurous spirit. She had indeed received more than one invitation from elder pupils at the Lodge to go home with them during the holidays. But Miss Meredith's treatment of her, and her experience during the visit to the Welsh vicarage, checked her inclination to accept these invitations. Twice a week Constance found Monsieur D'Iberville opposite to her at dinner. He invariably addressed most of his conversation to her. Among other reasons for her  being in especial favor with him, as his assistant she saved him a great deal of trouble. But this was not what most attracted him to her. Beautiful, intellectual, and perfectly at home in his native tongue, she interested him greatly; and learning that, young as she was and in her native country, she was as destitute of- the friends whom nature provides for us in our kinsmen, as he found himself in old age and exile, he felt a strong sympathy for her. His manner toward her was a mixture of paternal affection and   courtly gallantry; and she made his visits at the Lodge a pleasure, not a task. One day the old gentleman expressed his regret that Constance, while abroad, 'had seen so little of France, and especially of Paris. {But Paris and France," he added, with a sigh, are sadly changed in the fotv y years which hI-ave passed since the days of my youth." "At present," said Constance, "I am more anxious to travel at home than abroad. 1 know little of my own country. Indeed, I would be more than content could I spend the next holidays in LondoA, and see even a portion of the sights to be seen there." "And pray, Constance," said Mrs. Latimer, smiling but observant, " what sights in London would most attract your attention?" 1I have some of an artist's tastes," answered Constance. "And although for the gratification of such tastes London falls short of Rome, Florenlce, Paris, and even Dresden, where I once lived, yet I would gladly visit the Royal Ac'ademy of Arts, the British Museum, and other places of similar interest. You will call me an enthusiast when I tell you that I would go to London to see Raphael's cartoons at Iampton Court. Then I would be sure to go to the opera, especially now that Signorita Garcia is expected there. Perchance," she added, with a smile, "I mlight steal a lesson or two from her, and bring back some new quaver, and learn to play the mockinghird to this nightingale who enchhants the world. " "I have no doubt you would," said Mrs. Latimer, graciously; yet the shadow of a doubt crossed her brow, for she dreaded everything that might tempt Constance from the Lodge and possibly interfere with her return.. "I like, too, to see fite people," Constance continued. And, although going to the opera often is an expensive 27  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7202-00000158"/> 314        SAINT CECILIA. way of gratifying that taste, yet I migh-t find my way to the Park without 1)pying, a penny, and get a sight of the world of fashion circling there." But a shade of sadness passed over her face, as she thought that in that brilliant crowd her eye could not fail to light upon not a few allied to her in blood, by whom she was utterly forgotten. But she shook off this feeling and said, gaily, "In London I could enjoy a month's feast for both eye and ear, and bring back a store not easily exhausted. But I have no hope of soon partaking of this feast." " "I do not see," said Mrs. Latimer, " how you can just now gratify this very natural wish. Perhaps," tlought this lady, "a vacation so spent would tend to reconcile Constance to her quiet life here. She has no friends there, and no neans of getting into a socie-ty which might tempt her from so comfortable a home ab this, where she is so highly valued." "If you wish to visit London," said Monsieur D'lber- ville, "merely to see what is accessible to a stranger, you will not find it difficult to do so." "But it is very difficult to me," said Constance. "I have no friend to take me there, or to receive me when I get there. We poor women labor under a double disad- vantage. We have more curiosity than men, yet are not at liberty, like them, to ramble about by ourselves in order to gratify our curiosity." The conversation dropped here; but a week later Mon- sieur said to Constance; "I have a friend in London, whon, with his family, you would like to know. Monsieur Marigny, like myself, is one of the old emigles, so numerous in England forty years .ago, of whom few now remain. He is of noble birth, that is, his family belong to the noblesse, not of the sword, but the robe. He is an author too, having published one or two little works of merit,   SA NT CECILIA.        315 which have not met with the success they deserve. He and his daughters are engaged in teaching our language. Madame is an amiable lady, but an invalid, and engrossed by domestic duties. Monsieur Marigny has a wide knowl- edge of the best parts of London, being much employed as a teacher by people of rank. This family have occasionally received as inmates of their house puDils who wished to doniesticate themselves in a French family, in order to acquire speedily a mastery of the language. I can vouch for their high character and agreeable qualities, and am sure that they would be glad to receive you for sucl time as you may wish to remain in London." "If 1 knew how to get to London and back again," said Constance,. "I would be sorely tempted to pay them a visit during the holidays. Mrs. Latimer, do you know of any one with whom I might go and return?" In this visit to a needy French family, Mrs. Latimer saw nothing likely to alienate Constance from a comfortable home of far higher pretensions; so she at once suggested that Mrs. Nelson, the teacher of drawing and painting, always passed the holidays in London, and would doubt- less undertake to see Constance safely there and back again. So Constance at once applied to Mrs. Nelson, who promised to take charge of her, but not very cordially; for' she had never quite forgiven the contemptuous opinion Constance had unguardedly betrayed of her branch of art,-.water- color painting. Monsieur D'Iberville was then requested to apply to his friends in London; and as his epistle was laden with comments on the merits and attractions of his young friend, he prlomptly received aan answer expressing their anxiety to receive her. Constance had not acknowledged, all her motives for going to London ; some of them were perhaps not well defined to herself Having curbed her ambition as a  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7202-00000159"/> 316        SAINT CEC'IL . musician, from a conviction of the dangerous tendencies of this pursuit, her aspirations as a painter had received a new impulse. She had labored at two pieces with even more than her usual enthusiasm, and, as usual, was certain that these surpassed her former productions. She was not satisfied with the estimate put on her former pieces; perhaps she was becoming a little greedy of gain, and sought now to find a better agent between herself and the patrons of the art. Moreover, she felt a craving to learn something more than she knew of those families, high in rank, who were nearly allied to her, yet had forgotten her existence-. In London sle thought she might perchance gratify tlis longing, while she acknowledged to herslf that the inquiry was objectless, for she proudly resolved never to make any claim upon them. At length the holidays came. Constance was not now the despondent witness of the joyous departure of others to their homes. Mrs. Nelson was one of the first to leave the Lodge, with Constance under her wing. The next day she deposited her charge at the door of a dingy house, in a narrow street, in the western part of London. Here Constance was welcomed by a family decidedly French in physiognomy, manners, and politeness. She was soon sufficiently at her ease to make her ob- servations upon them. The mother, once a fine lady, had faded away to a careworn invalid, harassed by household duties in the struggle to eke out the small earnings of her husband and daughters. That husband, through long years of exile and poverty, still retained the air and tone of a high-bred gentleman. But, the daughters betrayed the hopeless nature of the long-continued struggle of de- cayed gentility against a combination of influences all tending to sink the family to a lower social grade. Exile; poverty, obscurity, the necessity of soliciting employment   SATNT CECILIA.        317 as the means of living,' and of putting a money value on every attainment, had lowered their tone, blunted their feelings, and degraded their bearing from the traditional nobility of their house. Constance could readily perceive why, while their father found pupils in the mansions of the wealthy and noble, the daughters could only obtain employment in second-rate schools. She felt a strong sympathy for these young women, fast ceasing to be young; for she saw that they had travelled farther than herself on that road which \was leading them and herself downward from the rank in which they were born, and that this downward 'rogress tends strongly to the degra-  dation of the mind. There need be nothing degrading in the condition of a ploughllan. We need not feel humiliated at selling our honest services for bread. But he must be strong in his integrity, unshakeh in his faith, who can pass through the process of degradation from ele- vated position to obscurity and want without degrading subserviency to men and rDinings at the judgments of God. Constance now received her two pictures, which had beenC sent from Latimer Lodge. Many things made it in- convenient to her to negotiate the sale of them herself; so she showed them privately to Monsieur Marigny, and con- sulted him as to the best mode of disposing of them. He was enough of a connoisseur in art to see that they pos- sessed great merit, and looked fromn the paintings to the youthful artist in astonishment. When Constance told him what prices she h:ad received for 'previous produc- tions, he pronounced the picture-dealer un fripon. On her indicating a wish that he Would undertake to dispo-e of them for her, trammelling him with no condition but the concealment of her ntnme, he at once carried them to a noted picture-dealer, and after consulting him, fixed a price 27 -  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7202-00000160"/> upon them, an left t  to the uertin verdict of the upon them, and left them to the uncertain verdict of the patrons of the art. One favor deserves another. Monsieur Marigny con- ceiving, from his friend's letter and his own observation, a high idea of Constance's capacity, requested her to read a little work he had published, and to give him her opinion whether he had proved the point aimed at in it. To read and criticise an author's book, for the benefit of the author, is the most delicate and thankless of tasks; and Constance took the volume with fear and trembling. Monsieur had spent the greater part of his life in teaching his native tongue in its greatest purity; and had now written a book to prove that the gradual corruption of the French lan- guage had been the cause of all the evils which France had suffered in the last half century. Constance read the book in good faith; and told the author, with not quite so much good faith, that although he had made out a very strong case in favor of his views, yet the corruption of morals and of language had walked so evenly hand in hand, that it was beyond her capacity to discover which had most wrought upon the other. This happened to be a season of leisure with one of the daughters, and Constance found in her a willing coim- panion on all the siglt-seeing expeditions and pleasure excursions on which two ladies could venture without an escort. And Monsieur Marigny at times accompanied them. He is an uncommonly busy Frenchman who does not readily find leisure for his diversions. Constance's industry as an artist, and her economical habits, had, in the course of the last year, replenished her purse; and she did not stint herself in the pursuit of the objects which had brought her to London. With one or more of this- family for companions, she visited picture-galleries, at- tended concerts, walked in the parks, and frequented other   E^JI ^llr1 u 1.      ^y 1 points of attraction. She bought a copy of the peerage, searched the London directory, and studied the journals - that recorded the events in fashionable life. Recalling to mind the families of rank with which she was allied, she hoped to get a glimpse of the persons, or at least of the residences of those who were in London. As she stu- diously avoided any claim tofhigh birth, she seldom ven- tured to inquire directly about them; but in her walks in the Park with Monsieur and his daughter, she found hin very useful in gratifying her curiosity. He had been for forty years employed as a French master by many people  of rank, and, both from policy and inclination, had made the most of his opportunities to become familiar with the nanies and persons of that class. Several times he uncon- sciously pointed out to Constance some one in whom she might have claimed not a remote kinsman; but no mem- ber of her uncle's family came under her observation, and bearing as she did the same name, she did not venture to inquire after them. Constance suffered one privation in London which she had not anticipated. The Marignys were Roman Catho- lics. That church had been an imposing part of the old regime which the Revolution had destroyed, changing the face of France and making it a foreign country to them. They were now probably more truly attached to the church, and derived more consolation from its rites, than in their palmy days; and they were punctual in their at- tendance on its calls. But when Constance sought to attend service on Sunday, she found that London had so far outgrown the provision made by the Church of England for its spiritual wants that to take part in its public wor- ship was a privilege which few but the rich could enjoy. Strongly as the corruptions of the Romish Church had been impressed upon her by her observations in Italy, she  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7202-00000161"/> 320        SAINT CECILIA. had there and elsewhere seen'its doors ever open to the poorest in the land; in this respect at least fulfilling the obligation of the church of fim who preached to all and died for all. The Marignys enjoyed Constance's society greatly. They were also as fond of sight-seeing as she was, but the res angutsta donmi usually curbed their taste for amuse- ment. Now Constance, with her special objects in view, was liberal in bearing the burden of concert tickets, hack hire, and other little expenses of pleasure seeking. 'hey evidently thought her a strange girl, and found it difficult to reconcile hel industry in frequenting public places with the simplicity of her dress, and the use she made of the veil in shunningi observation. Her visit to London was drawing to a close, when Mon- sieur Marigny came in one morning and triumphantly laid a Darcel of bank-notes before her. "The paintings of the unknown artist have at length found a purchaser," he said. A flash of triumph lit up her face. She felt that she was an artist. Indeed, she had been for soQme time so much inclined to this opinion that she had latterly marked each of her pieces with a modest "C-- G ,- in one corner, lest sonic rival artist should claim them. "The picture-dealer is anxious to know who ' C G---' is. But of course I did not gratify him. But I cannot conceive why you should keep it secret." Constance shook her head, with a smile saying, "For many reasons, Monsieur, C--  G--' must remain in- cognita."' Two of the objects which had brought Constance to London were yet unattained. Slle had caught no glimpse  of any member of her uncle's family; and Garcia had  begun to sing at the opera-house, and she had not yet heard her. The cost of tickets, and the style of dress   SAINT CECIL1A.        321 suited to the opera-house, had deterred the Marignys from thinking of going there; and Constance had shrunk from exposing herself to inquisitive eyes in that brilliant circle. But she could no longer resist the temptation. She must hear Garcia sing before leaving London. With the bank-notes lying before her, all considerations of economy vanished. Desirous to surround herself with a sufficiently numerous party, she proposed that the whole family should go that night to the opera. So delightful a proposal raised a commotion in the house. Preparations for fit dressing busied all the ladies; active negotiations were entered upon for the loan of opera-glasses; and Mon- sieur was sent out in a hurry to secure tickets and seats, and was successful, but could only get seats in the second tier. Resolved to lose no moment of so rare an enjoyment, the party were among the earliest in the opera-house. The French are economical even in their pleasures. While the audience were assembling, Monsieur, who had been shocked at the cost of the tickets, although paid for by another, gave Constance his views on the subject of pub- lic amusemlents.  "One of the first duties of government is to cultivate in the people a taste for refined pleasures, as the best mode of promoting civilization. It should therefore endeavor to bring so civilizing an institution as the opera within reach of as large a number as possible. Opera-houses and theatres should be under the patronage and control of the government, and in a measure maintained by it, in order to secure good management and a high order of entertain- ment. It might cost the government forty thousand pounds a year to do its part in maintaining this establish- nient,-and we will allow as much more for the theatres. Now there are more than twenty millions of people in the  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7202-00000162"/> 322        SAINT CECILEL4. three kingdoms; and if every individual were mlade to contribute a penny a year, it woulld more than sustain these institutions. Then every one that came to London might frequent them on paying a trifle, and their refining and civilizing influence would be disseminated throughout the land." Constance was solmewhat startled at this proposition, but was in no humor to discuss it. She merely answered, "Some people think that civilization, and liberty too, are best Fromoted bv letting each mnan consult his own taste in spending his own penll." The house began to fill ; and Monsieur ran his opera- glass along the bright array before him, eager to display lis familiarity with high life, by pointing out the luImina- ries in the world of rank and fashion. In his youth, when he had just donned his robes as a councillor in the parlia- lment of Paris, lie loved to frequent those courtly assem- I)lies which brought him for a moment in contact witlh the Cond6s, Luxemburgs, Crillons, Montmorencies, Poli- gnaes, and many another rance famous in the annals of France, so soon to perish under the guillotine, or )be scat- tered in exile. Age, poverty, exile, had not robbed himl of his taste for splendor, or his aspiration to mingle with the noblest of the land which he had made his home. With the, Frenchmlan's love of pageantry and spectacles, he gazed with earnest yet melancholy interest on the splendid circle around him, and with his glass sought out the scions of noble houses,-the Howards, StLaleys, Per- cics, Nevilles, Montagues, Seymours, Wellesleys, and a, number of other families equally or almost as well known ; while his wife and daughters listened to him as to anl oracle. Constance fully partook of their interest. These were the people among whom her birth entitled her to move as an equal. She looked with keen interest at the   SAINT CECIjI1A.        323 groups, as he pointed them out, and sighed as some name well known to her fell upon her ear. But soon all these feelings were utterly forgotten in the gratification of her passion for music. The orchestra was superb. At length the curtain rose, and Garcia came on in the character of Amina, in Bellini's new opera of La Sonnambula. H1er swelling notes. thrilled through the hearts of the audience. Constance forgot the existencet of thebrilliant circle around her. No note was lost on her, and her bosom heaved witlr deep emotion. To no one in that vast throng of listeners did the efforts of the songstress bring' such intense enjoyment as to her. Yet she at times detected a want of truthfulness and grace in expressing the impulse and the sentiment sought to be embodied in actioni and in song, and caught herself imag-  ining how she would have felt, sung, and acted the part. The applause was frequent and prolonged, and Constance shared the delighlt and admiration of the audience. But with her it awoke an emulous admliration. Her bosom heaved with the consciousness of powers hidden and sup- pressed, and she caught upon her murmuring lips the words, "I too could thrill your hearts with exquisite melody; I too could fascinate your eyes witl impassioned action!" The curtain fell upon the first act The audience, no longer enthralled by Garcia's witching voice, turned their eyes from' the stage to converse with their companions, or to gaze around this brilliant assembly. Presently a newly-arrived party entered a vacant box, nearly opposite to that in which Constance was seated in the tier above them. Monsieur Marigny at once called her attention to th lem "That is Lady Faringdon's party just taking their seats. The young ladies are two of her daughters. She  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7202-00000163"/> 324        SAINT CECILIA. has a little girl at home who is still my pupil. She is a haughty-looking dame; and her looks do not belie her." When he named Lady Faringdon, Constance started. Her whole attention was at once concentrated on this party. Monsieur perceived it, but not the intensity of her interest in them. "Ah, there she is, on the left of her mother; the taller young lady, with pearls wreathed into her auburn hair. That is Lady Flora, the eldest daughter. She was long my pupil; a most estimable and accomplished young lady. You see too that she has no small share of beauty, and that graceful repose of manner which should accom- pany noble birth. I cannot say the same for that restless younger sister seated by her. She is very brusque, and has a touch of her mother's disposition. When she was my pupil she did not always treat me with the respect called for by my age and our relations to each other. The young gentleman on the right, with liglt-brown hair, is Lord Lowestoff, the eldest son, and the other, taller, graver, and darker, is his friend, Mr. Lcvenworth. The Levenworths are a family of importance, although un- titled; and he is a young man of high promise. He is said to be the favored suitor of Lady Flora, but is to go abroad for a year or so." Monsieur continued his comments on the party opposite; and not a word was lost on Constance. With her glass steadily directed toward Lady Faringdon's box, her gaze, after surveying the party, became riveted on Lady Flora. Presently Monsieur roused her by exclaiming, as he low- ered his glass and turned suddenly to her, "By-the-by, Miss Guilford, you bear Lord Faringdon's family name. Can you be related to them?" Constance shifted her lorgnette to another part of the house to hide her embarrassment, but not very success-   SAINT CECILIA.        325 fully; and hastened to say, "Guilford is'not a very un- common name; nor are all who bear it akin to each other." Monsieur remarked her confusion.. Raising his glass, he gazed on the party opposite in silence. He looked at Lady Flora, then glanced at Constance. He could not b)e mistaken. There was a strong likeness,-a family likeness,and more, an individual resemblance between them. But in spite of his partiality for the gentle and gracious pupil of whom he was so proud, he was forced to admit that she was a feeble copy, on a smaller scale, of her who sat beside him. The same suspicion flashed upon his mind which had misled the maestro; and it soon rose to a conviction. He made no more comments on the party in Lady Faringd on's box, but employed his leisure in answering the various questions of his wife and daughters as to other distinguished parties in the dress- circle. The curtain rose again, and all eyes were attracted to the stage,-all eyes but those of Constance. For her Garcia now sang in vain. Her eye and her helart had found a stronger magnet. She too had perceived the like- ness. She saw opposite to her another self-less gifted perhaps by nature, but more blessed in fate. Constance gazed cagerly at her, giving little heed to the rest of the pa'ty. Lady Faringdon wa:s an imposing but haughty- looking woman. The younger daughter seemed flighty and talkative, and was much occupied in flirting with two young gentleman behind her. Lord Lowestoff yawned occasionally, and seemed to have conme there more from duty than foi' pleasure. But Lady Flora's placid face betokened different feelings. The respectful attention with which she leaned forward to listen to her mother's occasional remarks didj not escape Constance's eye, nor the quiet warning hand she laid upon her younger sister,  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7202-00000164"/> 326        SAINT CECILI4. when she would check her girlish, boisterous mirth. But usually sitting quiet, with her eyes fixed upon the stage, she-seenied to be in a state of passive enjoyment. For her Garcia did not sing in vain. 'Yet at times the gentle, earnest words of him who sat behind her seemed to fall yet more sweetly on her ear. The slight flushing of her cheek, the sweet smile, the confiding glance she turned upon him, all showed that it was neither from coldness of heart, nor dulness of perception, that her usual repose of manner sprung. Constance gazed long and eagerly at her and her sur- roundings, then turned and surveyed the group she her- self sat among. Besides the family with her, she was thronged upon by a crowd of strangers, many of them coarse and vulgar, and not a few prying in their looks, and impertinent in their whispered comments on herself. Her companions were the acquaintances of yesterday, foreign to her in race, language, and religious faith, and undergoing, through poverty and exile, a rapid deterioration from the elevation of tone which had once characterized their family. Was not she herself treading the same rapidly descending path which led downward in the social scale? She stood alone in the world, without position, without a friend, the object of impertinent, intrusive admiration, stimulated by suspicion, not respect. She again looked at her cousin, her other self, this friend by nature's allotment, torn apart from her by fate. How like, yet how unlike to herself! Surrounded by kindred, friends, wealth, luxury; shielded by the respectful admiration of the world, nursing the secret happiness of a well-bestowed love. What a contrast to her own troubled lot was this placid enjoyment of every earthly blessing Her eyes filled with tears, and bhe stretched out her arms toward her: "God's blessing be upon you, my sister!!"   SAINT CECILIA.         327 It chanced that every eye and ear were now centred on the stage, where a crisis in the opera was calling forth Galcia's most thrilling notes. Constance's gesture and words, if seen and imperfectly heard by any one, were at- tributed to musical enthusiasm. She hastened to suppress every indication of the emotions which agitated her. Put- ting her opera-glass to her eyes, she kept them fixed for some, minutes on the common centre of attraction. But she saw nothing there. When calm enough, she again turned her watchful eyes upon the family group, which alone in that vast concourse had now anv interest for her. The curtain fell again amid the deafening applause of the audience, and Lady Faringdon's )arty rose to leave the house. The rest of their evening was probably allotted to some more select, yet little less splendid assembly, in some private mansion. Lord Lowestoff gave his arm to his mother, Constance saw her cousin Flora take, with a modest but confiding air, the arm eagerly proffered to her, as if willing to rely on it as her siy through life ; and the party vanished from Constance's eyes. To her the curtain had already dropped on the interests of the night. IIcer feelings had been wrought up to the highest pitch. No lower emotions could agitate her now.. It needed a strong effort of self-control to enable her to ,ive heed and make appropriate answers to the rem1rk1 s of her French friends. When the curtain rose again she gazed and listened listlessly to that from which she had expected so muchl delight. She longed for the final drop- ping of the crtain, longced to escape fromn the throng and the brilliant lights around her, to shut herself up in her own1 chllamber and give vent to her tears, and to seek com- fort and counsel where alone she hope'd to find them. The minutes seemed to loiter, but at last the wished-for hour arrived. Escaping fromi that stifling crowd, hastening  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7202-00000165"/> to get rid of the distracting chatter of her companions, she shut herself in her own chamber, longing to be in darkness on her bed, to commune with her own heart and be still. "At length I am alone,-vet not alone. My God is still with me!" The next morning, when she met the family at breakfast, she found that they had not yet gotten over the excitement of last night's entertainment. For a time they almost forgot Constance; but presently the daughters expressed their regret that she had seemed not to enjoy herself as much as they had expected. Constance answered that she had been indisposed during the latter part of the even- ing; and her present paleness countenanced her statement. Monsieur Marigny, who had observed her more closely than the others, made no comments, for he thought that he had discovered the real cause of her agitation last night. At this moment Constance received, a note from Mrs. Nelson, saying that she would call for her the next morn- ing, on her return to Latimer Lodge. She sat musing for some minutes over this brief and not unexpected note. Had she accomplished all that she could holpe for in her visit to London? No. She felt a mysterious longing to catch one glimlpse, by daylight, of that household to whom she was so nearly allied, yet so utterly unknown,-to gaze once more on that sweet face, so calmly happy that it pictured, to Constance's eyes, heaven's own peace. Rousing herself from her reverie she said, "I have but one more day in London, and will not throw it away." Then, turning to Mademoiselle Marigny, she asked her to go out with her in the course of the morning. I have some purchases to make, and then wish to take one more stroll in the fashionable quarters before burying myself among the rustics of H--shire." Constance had made her purchases and sent them home;   and at that late hour, miscalled morning by the fashionable world, she, with Mademoiselle by her side, was sauntering rather than walking in R.- Street, where the mansions of many families of the highest rank are to be found. The street was beginning to afford numerous indications of the class of people who found homes there. Groups of tall foot- men in gorgeous liveries lounged about the doors; fashion- able-looking people, not hurried by the calls of business, strolled along the sidewalks-; 'and well-appointed carriages, from the light cabriolet to the stately coach, with the arms of some noble family emblazoned on the panels, rolled over the pavement. For some time Mademoiselle enjoyed her promenade in this fashionable quarter, and often called Constance's atten- tion to some person or object worthy of note. But she was soon struck with her young companion's silence and ab- straction. She no longer seemed to hear the remarks made to her, but eyed with keen interest each stately mansion as she passed it; and once paused for a moment, as if she had found what she was seeking. It was but for a moment. and Constance passed on, but turned soon and seemed re. solved to limit her walk to that immediate neighborhood, Mademoiselle dropped a little behind her companion, who seemed to have forgotten her existence. A coach was standing before the door of a large and handsome house,- the house at which that short pause had been made. Con- stance looked fixedly at the livery of coachman and foot- man, and at the arms on the panel of the coach. Made- moiselle, following her example, observed the supporters to the shield, indicating the rank of the owner. After passing a little way on, Constance turned again, and was strolling slowly toward this mansion, when the door was thrown open by the porter, and three footmen, lounging on the steps, drew repectfully aside. Constance looked at the 28*  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7202-00000166"/> 330         SAINT CEOILIA. door with eager expectation. On her mental vision rose a vivid image of Lady Flora, with a more shadowy group around her. But in place of her, a gentleman stepped forth alone. He appeared to be between fifty and sixty, was of good stature, anid retained many of the personal advantages which must have marked his youth. He came slowly, down the steps, as if in deep thought, but while drawing on his gloves, he glanced up and down the sidewalk. From among the many objects before him his observa- tion singled out a lady, apparently followed by her maid, an unmistakable French woman  The lady was tall, her person noble, her movements graceful, but singularly slow. He could not well distinguish her features, for her veil was down, and her left hand was employed in keeping it so; but, although somewhat gravely dressed, she was evidently quite young, and-he could not be mistaken-her keen eyes were riveted on himself. That face, imperfectly as he saw it, seemed familiar to him. Where could he have seen it? Still looking at her, he moved toward his coach. The footman threw open the doors, but he paused. before stepping into it. Constance had already forgotten her disappointment in not again seeing Lady Flora. She at once recognized who this was who had come forth in place of her, and she now gazed with equal interest, but far different feelings, upon him  In spite of the widely different careers and destinies of the two brothers, the family type of form and features was strongly stamped on each of them, and Constance at once recognized the uncle whom she had never seen. But the expression of his face, grave almost to sadness, his air of quiet dignity, yet more, his likeness to her father, touched her heart, awakening far different emotions from those with wlich she had expected to look upon him. When near to him she involuntarily paused for a moment, gazin-g   SAINT CECTLIA.        331 sorrowfully at him. What a world of feelings, how sad a' past, how gloomy a future was concentrated in that look! Lord Faringdon raised his hat, and leaned forward with an air of interest, as if expecting her to speak to him. She bowed low, but waved him off with her right hand, as if correcting a misapprehension; then, raising her head proudly, walked swiftly-on, followed by the much-puzzled Madermoiselle Marigny, whom Lord Faringdon had de- graded to the position of the lady's maid.. He stood gazing with an air of sad interest and curiosity after this unknown lady, who, he felt almost certain, was not a. stranger to him. "I wish she had spoken to me," he murmured. "This is some case of pride battling against misfortune, and winning the fight." And full of sad thoughts he stepped slowly into his coach. ' When Mademoiselle reached home she took occasion to give her father an account of the singular behavior of their guest during the walk in R-- Street. He listened atten- tively, but made no comment. He at once recognized the house, so closely observed, as Lord Faringdon's, the gen- tleman, whiom Constance had observed still more closely, as Lord Faringdon himself. He was now certain that lhe had discovered Constaice's origin, and the cause of her interest in the Guilford family. Iter likeness to Lady Flora, or rather Lady Flora's likeness to her, was unmistakable, and it now flashed upon him, that at the moment when Constance at the opera made that strange gesture toward  the party opposite to them, he had heard the word " sister" murmured by her lips. But Constance had won greatly upon Monsieur Marigny. There was a noble, spirit in her, which, yet more than her beauty, had awakened all his chivalry; and he resolved not to breathe one word, even to his own family, as to her supposed origin, that. might lower her in their estimation. The ruined exile was  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7202-00000167"/> 332        SAINT CEOILIA. still a gentleman; if he had her secret, it was safe with him. Mrs. Nelson called the next morning according to her appointment, and Constance bade adieu to her French friends, leaving them full of regrets at her departure, but much puzzled to account for some of her peculiarities. In two days she was again at Latimer Lodge, and she could not say that she had been disappointed in her objects in visiting London. Yet so much had occurred there to agitate her heart and mortify her pride, that she more than ever felt the Lodge to be a place of refuge, and hoped never to leave it unless under more favorable circumstances than she had yet done. Whatever Mrs. Latimer's hidden character might be, she was practically the safest friend on whom Constance could rely. However monotonous life might be at the Lodge, it was a respectable and comfort- able home, and she was thankful for being provided with such a hon-e and such a friend. Mrs. Latimer's reception of her was indeed most flatter- ing. She was as kindly inquisitive as to Constance's success in the objects of her visit to London, as if she had been her own daughter, questioning her as to all she had seen and heard, and much interested in the description of her new French friends, But she was too acute not to dis- cover that Constance left some part of her narrative untold; that something, perhaps many things, had occurred to shock her feelings and mortify her pride. She saw that Constance was truly glad to come back to the Lodge, and its mistress congratulated herself on having secured, prob- ably for a long term, an inmate so useful in her school, and so agreeable to herself. Why should not Constance rejoice to return to Latimer Lodge? Did not eyes brighten and lips part in kindly welcome on her return? Did not Mrs. Latinier receive   SAINT CECILIA.         333 her with the air and tone of a mother, well simulated per- haps, yet not altogether assumed? Did not pupils and teachers rival each other in their welcomes? Did not Monsieur D'Iberville mingle, with the gallant bow of the courtier, a parental affection in his greetings? Had not her absence been lamented by Dr. Fuller, and the clerk, and the organist, and the bellows blower, and the whole congregation, who hailed her return as a joyful event? Why, she asked herself, should she look beyond this little world which treated her with so much kindness and con- sideration? Here she could find duties, here she might find peace. For what more should a Christian spirit ask! !"Oh, let me remember how much I have to be thankful for I What is my poverty to the destitution of thousands around me! What are my mental troubles to the afflic- tions which stalk through the world! Let me not forget the godless destitution of millions in this very land, and be thankful for the light vouchsafed to me. The very memory of the regretted past, of those I have loved and lost, is a safeguard and a blessing to me!"And thankful ness for the lot assigned her filled her eyes with tears. CHAPTER XXVIII.

Not so. Fromn three different quarters the most diligent search was making for one who was in obscurity indeed, but hiding from no one, and not unwilling to be found; yet these efforts were made in vain. Of all those who were called upon to feel any interest in her, no one knew where she was but an inquisitive and meddlesome abortion of an attorney, who did not know what use to make of his intelligence. After writing to his agent to make private inquiries as to what had become of his brother's daughter, Lord Far- ingdon waited, at first without impatience, for an answer. His thoughts were more occupied with considering what he should do with her when found. Iis wish was to re- ceive her into his own family. Yet lie did not feel sure that she would be willing to come to him, and also feared that it night require the exertion of no little tact and de- cision at home to carry his point without exciting domestic jars. Ite at length came to the conclusion that, until he had found his niece, he could decide on nothing; and he wrote again impatiently to his agent, urging him to activity in his search. The solicitor in reply informed hinm that Miss Guilford was not living with any of her maternal relatives, and that after as active inquiry as was compatible with privacy, he had failed to find her in England. He had then written to a correspondent in Malta, to make diligent but private inquiry as to the young lady's move- ments; whether she had left. the island, when, and with whom. As soon as Lord Faringdon calie up to town he hast- ened to the solicitor, to learn what progress had been made in this curious search. Letters had been received from Malta. The day on which Miss Guilford had sailed, the name of the vessel, and those of the ladies she accom-   SAINT CECILIA.        335 panied were all specified. The addresses of these ladies were ascertaincd; they were written to, and heard from. One of them had left the party at Portsmouth. The other had escorted Miss Guilford to Londun, and left her at a respectable private boarding-house in P-Street; but the writel had forgotten the name of the person who kept it. P--- Street, not a short one, with many boarding- houses in it, was carefully canvassed, and at length it was ascertained, from Mrs. Randall and her daughter, that Miss Guilford had spent nearly a week with them several months before. They, the daughter especially, were very communicative as to their guest, commenting on her beauty, her singularities, and the singularity of her posi- tion, and on their own acuteness and suspicions. They told of her transaction with the jeweller, and her visits to the shops of the picture-dealers; but they knew nothing of her having sold paintings to one of them, and could tell nothing as to the route by which she had left London. The jeweller was called upon but could throw no light on the subject. To prevent unpleasant surmises, all these inquiries were made under the plea of seeking payment of an account run up in Malta. It was merely a small creditor asking where he could find his debtor. The solicitor was at a dead fault. Lord Faringdon urged him on to further inquiry, and not to spare money in the search; but still insisted on privacy. He justly thought that it would never do to have it known that the nearest relative of a young lady of her birth and connec- tions had been making for months the most strenuous efforts to find her, and was utterly unsuccessful, The solicitor at last remembered that Miss Randall had incidentally mentioned Miss Guilford's maid. Find- ing that Miss Randall did not know-the maid's name, he wrote at once to Malta to ascertain it. It was sent him,  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7202-00000169"/> 336        SAINT CECILIA. with a bad character tacked on to it. With Lord Faring- don's consent, he inserted in the "Times" and other journals the following advertisement: "If Mary Bowman, who, as a servant, accompanied a young lady from Malta to London in September last, will call upon J. S. Copland, Solicitor, No. 91 L-- Street, she will hear of something to her advantage." In the course of the next few days so many Mary Bow- mans called on Mr. Copland that he concluded that to be the commonest name in London  But as none of them, could give the name of the young lady correctly, they were all evident impostors. The notice may never have caught the'eye it was meant for. Miss Guilford's quondam maid found it convenient to change her name occasion- ally; and she may have looked upon an attorney's chain- bers as a dangerous trap, and shunned the interview. Time passed on, and the solicitor found no solution to the' mystery, but was urged not to relax his efforts. The de- sire to learn the fate of his brother's daughter had become with Lord Faringdon a chronic anxiety. Yet more anxious and keener inquiry had at length originated in another quarter. When Ormond turned his back on the white walls of Valetta, in the bitterness of spirit engendered by his disappointment, he resolved not only to forget, but to trample down every feelingi which tended to divert him from the path he had chosen, the un- deviating pursuit of success and distinction as a soldier. But some feelings will not be trampled down, and sonme persons are not easily forgotten; nor was the leisure of a sea voyage favorable to his resolution. He caught him- self several times taking out the note he had received from Constance and reading it over in a lover-like mood. He had not the heart to destroy it; but sealed it up reso- lutely, and formally endorsed upon it, " ot to be opened    SAINT CECILIA.        338 for two years." He trusted in that time to be too deeply interested in an active and enterprising career, to be moved by his present weakness. With all Ormond's capacity, enterprise, and energy, perhaps the chief difference between himself and Colonel  Guilford was that between the lucky and the unlucky soldier. Arriving at Alexandria, Ormond, hastened on by a short and then unusual route, incurring much expense and no little hazard, which he thought well repaid by a speedy arrival at the headquarters of his new regiment, at a post north of Delhi. From thence he was at once sent to join a detachment, posted in the wild and broken region on the eastern border of the Punjaub, and near the foot of the Himalayas. He was now near neighbor to the warlike but divided Sikhs, destined soon to try the prowess of the British soldiery, and hold successfully against them more than one well-fought field. At this period the Punjaub was in a disturbed condition, and from time to time many acts of violence and petty war were committed by the chiefs in the rude and remote dis- tricts on the upper borders. Ormond's brother officers were restless and dissatisfied at the out-of-the-way post, cut off from the society and resources of the larger can- tonments. But the condition of affairs in the neighbor- hood interested Ormond greatly, leading him to anticipate soon finding something to do in the way of his profession. So he occupied himself unceasingly in informing himself as to the people and the bountry around him. He found his best, source of intelligence in a native merchant, a-Mohanmmedan of Delhi, who had made many trading journeys into the upper districts of the Punjaub. But on the last he had been robbed, stripped of his whole stock in trade, his servant killed, he himself barely escaping 29  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7202-00000170"/> 3.38       S 4AINT CECIL IA. with life. He was so utterly beggared, that he dared not return to face his creditors in Delhi. Accident having called Ormond's attention to his case, his free hand fur- nished the bankrupt with the means of engaging in a little peddling business among the troops for his present main- tenance. From him Ormond learned that the chief actor in the plundering excursions along the adjacent border was a restless Sikh chief, in bad odor with his own country- men. But having possession of a hill-fortress, strong, both from the difficulties of approach and access, he felt limself it these troubled times quite safe in plundering his neighbors. The merchant had often visited this hill- fort, had frequent dealings with the chief, purchasing the more portable part of the crops which were reaped with the sword, and had thus become not only intimate with the freebooter, but well acquainted with the strong and weak points of the fortress. Moreover, the merchant was convinced that the last time he had left the place, laden with many valuables purchased from the chief, he had been waylaid and robled by his contrivance; The mer- chant was perhaps little better than a systematic purchaser of stolen goods. But Ormond was struck with his intelli- gence, keenness of observation, arnd enterprising temper; and vet more by the fierce desire he betrayed for ven- geance on the Sikh chief. Noting these things, Ormond treated him with some consideration, and induced him to remain with the detachment. The adjacent region continuing much disturbed, the major in command received orders to break up froim his cantonment, and exert himself to put -a stop to the opera- tions of these plundering banditti. It was at the hottest season of the year that lie moved under a scorching sun through a parched country, towards the point where the marauders were last heard of. When he reached it they   SAINT CEOILIA.        339 had vanished, to, reappear in another part of the country. This happened more than Once, and the small moving column, consisting of one company of the king's troops and five compand fi ies of Sepoys, were getting well fagged and sick of their campaign, when they got intelligence of a more extended raid, by a larger force than' on former odcasions. The column was again in motion, when, be- tween heat, fatigue, port wine, and vexation of spirit, the major had a stroke of the sun, and the command devolved on Ormond, the only captain in the liDng's srvice present. Ortmond sent off a dispatch with this intelligence to headquarters. But we do not know that he laid great stress on expediting the movements of his courier. Mean- while he was not idle. He knew that he would be ordered to halt until an officer of higher rank and more experience should join the column. He was sure that the general commanding this military district would not dream of entrusting the leading of this column and the conduct of a nice operation to a young 'captain who had been but two months in India, never seen any service, and must be utterly ignorant of mountain warfare. But on this latter point especially Ormond had full confidence in himself, on grounds which it would not do to communicate to his com mllander. Ormond knew well th:t in war celerity secures secrecy and multiplies force. He was also a firmn believer in the maxim of Monticuculi, who, when asked what was the first thing necessary in war, relIied, Money. , hat the second? Money. What the third? More m oney. It is indeed a fourth arml of the service which should rank first. Cavalry, artillery, infantry, eacl need a suitable field. But there is no field of operations in which excellent service may not be done by nieqtey. Ornmold had good intelligence that the marauding chief  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7202-00000171"/> 340       SAINT CECILIA. was three days' march off, with a difficult country to pass through before he could reach his position, with the prob- ability of notfinding him when he got there. His strong- hold was two days' march off, through a much more difficult country; but there was little probability of meet- ing any other than natural obstacles on the route, and the certainty of finding the hill-fort there, and most of its garrison absent. He sent for the bankrupt merchant who still accompanied the column, and promised him two thou- sand rupees if he would conduct him by a route practicable for a light column, and point out the weakest points in the fortress; and four thousand more should it fall into Ormond's hands. The merchant snatched at the offer as a capital commercial speculation; but revenge spurred him on even more keenly than lucre. In two hours the column was on the march, by a course at right angles with its ?former route. Threading its way under a skilful guide through narrow, steep, and rugged passes,-the sudden- ness of the movement prevented opposition,-and in the afternoon of the second day Ormond stood before the hill- fort, but with his force concealed from view; and had ascertained that its garrison was neither numerous nor efficient. They were, however, active in preparing to de- fend it. It was a rocky hill, rising abruptly, at some points precipitously, from the valley. The lower end was occu- pied by a small walled town, towered over at the. otler end by a citadel communicating with it. The whole circuit of the walls was far too extended to be well manned by the force that threatened it, and now the garrison could not be much more numerous. In spite of the excessive fatigue of the troops, Ormond threw a cordon of outposts around the place, pushed for- ward his mountain howitzers'to a sheltered spot, which hi hastily improved, and began to shell the town, and the   SAINT CECILIA.        341 gate especially, in a very; noisy style,-the fire being re- turned from more numerous and heavier pieces. While he had preparations made, out of sight, for an escalade, he employ'ed the remaining two hours of daylight in a close survey of the whole circuit of the walls, being accompanied only by his merchant guide, who proved himself both cool and daring in his keen anxiety to point out the access to the robber's den. Having satisfied himself as to the best points for an assault, Ormond organized a choice storming party, consist- ingr chiefly of volunteers from the Sepoys, divided the rest of his force into several parties, assigning to each a point of attack, and then gave the exhausted soldiers some hours rest. Two hours before dawn the whole command, in different parties, stealthily approacled, each its different point of assault. As soon as he heard the tumult and firing at the town walls, Orniond, with the bankrupt and revengeful merchant by his side, and followed by his select band of the boldest and mnost active Sepoys, with the aid of ladders, stealthily crept up a steep but broken face of the rock, and s(aled the town wall, close to where it joined the citadel, in the face of the fire of a feeble guard. Then, while a few sprang forward to explode powder-bags against the gate of the citadel, the rest applied their ladders to a low part of the wall, and made their way to the rampart with little opposition; for its defenders were few,-nearly the whole garrison being engiaged in defending the town, as the weaker point, and that which contained their families and homes. At the moment that Ormond reached the rampart of the citadel, a powder-bag, placed and fired by the hand of the daring merchant, explqded and shattered the gate to firag ments. This explosion was annswered by a lhout. f'rom one 29*        I  &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7202-00000172"/> 342        SAINT CECILIA. of the storming parties, which had just made its way into the town. The more energetic part of the garrison rushed toward the citadel, but being received by a smart fire from the gate and the ramparts, they found that stronghold was already lost, and now directed their energies to making their escape from the town while darkness prevented pursuit. All resistance ceased. The robber chieftain had lost his stronghold. The merchant was avenged-and Ormond paid the well-earned rupees to his heirs. He himself had fallen dead before one of the few shots fired in defence of the gateway, at the moment he lighted the fuse. At daylight Ormond hastened to-restore order, and lost, no time in sweeping the country around for supplies to enable him to hold what he had won. But no attempt was made to dislodge him. The marauding chieftain had lost his fortress, his wives, and his treasures, which he valued more than his wives. His ambitious hopes were crushed, and he sank at once into a roving adventurer without a home. The value of this hill-fortress was well known, and Ormond had now made a long step onward in his profes- sional career. But it would have been incomplete had he not promptly forwarded to headquarters a report of his operations, so lucid and graphic, that he at once became known there and elsewhere, as a soldier who did his work quickly and well. When the superior officer, who had been despatched in a hurry to take the place of the disabled major, arrived at the newly-won fortress, Ormond was so much at home there that he was able to dine him sumptuously in the durbar of the citadel, amid Oriental magnificence, the fruit of many a plundering campaign. To follow further Ormond's military career is not neces-   SAINT CECILIA.        343 sary to our tale. Fortune, fickle goddess, was his fast friend. Being considered a safe hand for nice duties, he was niuch employed on remote frontiers, and was kept so busy that he had little leisure or opportunity to keep himself in- formed as to what went on at home. He had been nearly two years in India, when on receiving a file of English papers and looking over the army intelligence with special care, he discovered that the --th regiment was no longer at Maltat but in Ireland, and that Lieutenant-Colonel Stapleton, the late senior major, was in command. Wlhat had become of Colonel Guilford? Had ill health at last compelled him to retire from active service? Ormond was intensely anxious to get intelligence of him. But some time elapsed before he met with an officer who was able to inform him that Colonel Guilford had died at, Malta many months before. He heard this with a singu- lar mixture and conflict of emotions. He could not but deeply regret the death of one who had commanded his high esteem, and who had exhibited so strong a predilection for him. But Constance's words again rang in his ears: "My father, my poor father I I must never leave him!"And his heart leapt in his bosom at the thought that she was no longer trammelled by this tie of duty. He at once wrote to his solicitor in London, to ascertain by private inquiry and inform him speedily, when and under what circumstances Colonel Guilford had died, and what had become of his family. For some reason Ormond chose to use this word in his inquiry after one person. At that time communication between England and India, al- though growing more speedy, was still slow, and months must elapse before the solicitor's answer could reach Ormond's hand. He was on n official journey of exploration with a strong escort, among wild fiontier tribes, when, late at night, he  &#xD;<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7202-00000173"/> 344        SAINT CECILIA. received despatehes from headquarters, and with them the long-expected letter from England. Tearing it open he read it eagerly, to find nothing in it but disappointment and anxiety. The solicitor; after answering the inquiries as to Colonel Guilford's death, went on to say that since the death of the colonel's wife, his family had consisted of one daughter, who, on her father's death, at once returned to England. But the solicitor had ascertained that she was not living with any of her relatives, and had been unable to trace her. Ormond bitterly cursed his negligent and bungling agent, who little suspected the intensity of the feelings that had prompted these inquiries. In restless excite- ment Le hastened out of his tent, to cool and calm him- self in the night air. He forgot the tropical heavens over- head, the jungle teeming with malaria around him, and near at hand, the dusky forms stretched off in rleep; while his spirit flew back to Malta clad in poetry and beauty, reflected from the vision which rose up before him, of Constance in her brightest and most joyous mood. "Where is she now? And of that joy and brightness how much is left?" He lost not one moment in writing precisely and impe- riously to the solicitor to lose no time in discovering Miss Guilford's residence, while taking care to observe the utmost privacy and delicacy in his inquiries, and not to regard expense. The solicitor now rightly construed the motives of his client, and justly estimated the intensity of the interest he felt in Miss Guilford. Thus spurred on, he used the utmost diligence, and tasked his ingenuity to solve the mystery of her seclusion; but was not more successful than Lord Faringdon's agenf in the same pur- suit. While the efforts of the two parties, moved by the   SAINT CECILIA.        345 strongest and best impulses, were doomed to disappoint- ment, a third, stirred by less elevated motives, and at first less eager in the search, became at length thoroughly in- terested, and was at last successful. When a zealous patron of the turf is compelled to with- draw the fleet and stanch racer, with which he has con- tended for many a prize, he finds it difficult to stand by, an idle spectator, while others enjoy the excitement and triumphs of that glorious sport. He is irresistibly driven to seek out some promising successor to his retired favor- ite, who, under his judicious training, may compete with the swiftest, and renew for his trainer the triumphs of former days. Much akin to the position and feelings of this sporting character, were those of the Honorable Mrs. Beresford. She had early entered her daughter on the grand course of fashion; had trained her skilfully, having been herself a belle in her youth; and had run her persistently on many a match in which coronets or broad acres were the prizes. Having at length made a pretty good catch, her winning courser passed off the turf under the title of Viscountess Colbrooke, the wife of a nobleman twice as old as herself, with a turn for diplomacy, which he now exercised as ambassador at one of the small German courts, while he-- left his not very large and somewhat encumbered estates to the nursing of a judicious agent who had succeeded'in persuading his lordship that he would not need a large income at so small a court. Mrs. Beresford was now left alone, and time began to hang heavy on her hands. It is true that she was an ac- complished woman, gracious in manner, agreeable in per- son, excelling in conversation, and possessed in her own right of a large property, but, moderately dipped by her style of living for some years past. Yet she did not find  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7202-00000174"/> 346        SAI1VT CECILIA. herself in so much demand as she had been. The choice young men of rank no longer frequented her drawing-room, nor rode alongside of her coach in the Park, nor sought admission to her opera-box. Invitations to select little parties at the first houses became less frequent, and some- times she found herself almost neglected at a rout. True, she was nearlv fifty, and did not pretend to be young. She had been for some years widely known as the very fascinating mother of a charming belle. Very lately, through the medium of blooming two-and-twenty in the person of a handsome, sprightly, accomplished but some- what wilful daughter, she had enjoyed many of'the ad- vantages of youth. She still loved society and influence as much as ever. But she could no longer indulge in the sport which for some years had made the chief excitement of her life. Her nag was now off the turf, and she found that even the accomplished and agreeable Mrs. Beresford, without a young beauty in her train, was almost as incom- plete in her equipment as the most skilful jockey without a steed. For more exciting than the Derby day, is that competition on the turf of fashionable life, in which the entries are made and the race is run for the coronet or the broad acre prize. Nor is the sport marred, but heightened, by dispensing with the rigid and vigilant morality of the patrons of equine racing. Here intrigue and jockeying are freely resorted to, and far more likely than fair dealing to attain success. As Mrs. Bercsford had no more daughters, her case seemed hopeless. But she was not the woman to despair. It is not unusual for one sporting man to enter a. horse owned by another; and Mrs. Beresford looked through the households of her kinsmen and near friends, going even into their nurseries in her search, in the hope of find- ing some high-bred filly of form and spirit, standing in   SAINT CECILIA.        347 need of a, patroness, able as Mrs. Beresford was, to put her into training and enter her to advantage for the struggle over the matrimonial course. But she searched in vain. She found, on passing them in review, then subjecting them to a rigid inspection, that the beauties wanted wit, and the wits wanted beauty, or some other radical, incurable defect marred their good points; for she required in her protegee a rare combination of high quali- ties. Disappointed in not finding what is scarcely to be found, she was forced to stand aside for a time, an idle spectator, while less skilful jockeys occupied the turf. In truth, she was hunting for a Flying Childers of a girl. Had she lived in our day, she would have found many fast enough, in one sense, Hleaven knows. It has been 'mentioned that Mrs. Beresford, on hear- ing of Colonel Guilford's death, had mentally reverted to that of his wife two years before, and had jotted down on the ivory tablet of her artificial memory the inquiry, "What has become of Cousin Fa:nny's girl?" This question occasionally sprang up in her mind; but before it could bear fruit, it was nipped in the buWd by some agreeable excursion, or a week's visit to some pala- tial country-house crowded with guestts, or some other diversion which filled up her time. Once or twice she dwelt long enough on the subject to remark to herself, "Cousin Fanny was a lovely girl, and few as pretty fel- lows as Harry Guilford ,enter thb army nowadays. I wonder if their daughter inherits their good looks? She can inherit little else, poor thing!" She had indeed expected to hear from her long before this. For she had received Colonel Guilford's letter ,written somle months before he died, bespeaking her pro- tection for his daughter in case of his death. Without denying the claims of blood, for she was proud of the  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7202-00000175"/> 348       SAINT CECIL A. ancient but decayed family from which her father sprang, and set a certain value on all those in whose veins its blood flowed, she had not answered this letter; not caring to pledge herself absolutely to what might prove a bur- densome engagement. Now as time passed on, she felt no little surprise at hearing nothing of her young kins- woman. But her passive wonder took a more active form, on accidentally hearing a young officer say, while speaking of the society at Malta, "Colonel Guilford too had a handsome and accomplished daughter ; but she was very young, and lived a retired life on account of her mother's recent death." Mrs. Beresford pricked up her ears at these words. Handsome, accomplished, and an orphan, with no relative as near as herself,-for Lord Faringdon was out of the question. Mrs. Beresford hated living alone, and she hated humble companions, the usual resource of childless ladies of fortune. She wanted a companion whom she could pet, and the world would'pet with her. She had hitherto avoided making direct inquiries after Miss Guilford. Like Lord Faringdon, she thought it would sound very strangely in the world's ears-those ears that hear everything, and so misconstrue what they hear-that the nearest relatives of a young lady of Miss Guilford's birth did not know where to find her. This consideration induced her to make no inquiry in her own person;- but she wrote to her solicitor to take active but private steps to accomplish the object which she now had at heart. So it happened that three sharp London at- torneys were put by their different clients on the track of a young lady, who was hiding from no one, and not un- willing to be found. The legal hounds entered keenly on the scent, followed it eagerly, and came to a fault, at different times, but at   SAINT CECILIA.        349 the same spot, from which she had taken her departure for Latimer Lodge. In beating about the bushes they at length came upon eacll other; that is, Ormond's solicitor, the latest in the field, tracing Miss Guilford to Mrs. Ran- dall's, there learned that two parties had been before him on the same errand. He learned their names, hast- ened to apply to them, and at length brought them to-. gether. They held a conference; each suppressing the name of his client, while avowing the object of his search, and that it originated in the most friendly motives. Nothing had occurred to raise the hopes of any one of thlem. But the singularity of the affair stimulated them to combine and redouble their efforts. 'They at length discovered that Riddell &amp; Son had been Colonel Guilford's solicitors, and they sought a conference with them. Since we last saw the members of this legal firm, Rid- dell, Senior, had found out that the attempt to make an attorney of Riddell, Junior, was costly up-hill work. He had spoilt two or three very promising affairs entrusted to him, and had proved himself neither capable nor trust- worthy. His father now merely employed him in some of the routine of their business, and did not encumber him with much of that. When this conference of attorneys took place, Riddell, Junior, was not called to take part in it. But being a man of much leisure and elegant tastes, he sat in the next room, solacing himself with a cigar, and a volume of the Sport- ing Magazine. Riddell, Senior, was not able to throw any light on the path taken by the young lady for whom his brother at- torneys were searching. But his young client, in their short interview, had mlade a deep impression on him. He dilated on her beauty,'her self-command, and the lofty pride with which she scorned to make any application to 30  &#xD;<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC7202-00000176"/> 350       SAlNT C CLILIA. Lord Faringdon, lest she should seem to admit that her father had estranged himself from him on no just grounds. He now stated that the affairs of McCauley &amp; Reid, of Calcutta, were likely to turn out a little better than he had anticipated. and that Colonel Guilford's heir might have all interest in their assets This authorized him, without the appearance of intermeddling, to join them in their search. Admitting the propriety of avoiding all publicity in it, he suggested h that they should employ a certain de- tective officer who had made himself famous by his saga- city in feri'eting out the most mysterious affairs, and the most cunningly-hidden agents concerned in them, and his brother attorneys assented to this. While Miss Guilford's affairs were under discussion, and four wise heads were taxing their ingenuity to dis- cover what could have become of her, there sat idling in the next room the only man in London who could have given them accurate intelligence of her. But unhappily they omitted to apply to him. Yet through that mysterious influence by which mind operates on mind, without any obvious communication through the senses-the explanation of which vve leave to the philosopher Mesmer and his disciples- Riddell, Junior, while deepin the bloody fight between the cham- pion of England and Sledge-hammer Pick, of Norwich, had gotten only to the twenty-second round, when sud- denly the pugilists, seconds, bottle-holders, with the ring, and the enthusiastic crowd of the fancy that surrounded it, were all hustled off the field of his imagination, and he found himself, in the spirit, far away in the West of England, whither his father had sent him some months before, on a matter of business, which he lhad marred in transacting. But his thoughlts were not upon that. In the spirit, he was now in a quiet little village, seated in a   SAINT CECILLA.        351 quaint old church, with the solemn words of the service murmuring in his unheeding ears, while he gazed on a beautiful and noble young face, which he had seen once before; but now, with eyes turned heavenward, and lips that moved in prayer, a holy reverence was stamped upon it, which awed the frivolous spirit within him, awakening feelings better suited to the place. Still, in the spirit, he followed the young devotee as she left the church, watch- ing her graceful movements, and then hastening on before her, in order, from a hidden point, to gaze once more upon that lovely face. As the conference deepened in the next room, and the anxiety there to trace her grew more in- tense, in obedience to the combined influences which emanated thence, her image rose more vividly before him, and he exclaimed, "Devilish fine oirl I I never met her match!"And puffing away at a .resh cigar, he devoutly burned incense to her beauty. Thus passed the hour in successive visions with the same central object, crowding on his fancy. He saw her passing through varying ad- venturous scenes, sought for and pursued, but always evading her pursuers. But whether through the indirect application of the subtile mesmeric influence, or the feeble- ness of- the medium, the spirit of prophecy died away within him, and he made no revelation. The conference broke up in the next room, and the vision faded from his eyes in this. The next day the three attorneys held a couference with the sagacious slot-hound,--held to be infallible in track- ing mystery and crime. But as Mr. Riddell was the only one of the four attorneys who had a personal knowledge of Miss Guilford, the detective was sent to him for his last instructions. He listened attentively to the old solicitor's precise description of Miss Guilford, and to his account of his interview with her,-hler self-possession, her firm-  &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7202-00000177"/> 352        SAINT CECILIA. ness under misfortune, her proud bearing, and her haughty refusal when urged to permit an application to be made to her uncle, Lord Faringdon. With professional exactness he repeated their conversation in the very words they had uttered. Had the detective been witness to the interview he might have received the same impressions as the solicitor; but, getting it only at second-hand, he drew exactly opposite inferences, and saw in Miss Guilford only a self-willed beauty, defiant of the customs and opinions of society, and rashy relying on her personal influence to command friends and fortune. "But she must be a girl of no com- mon powers," he muttered, "for she has put her finger in this sharp old gentleman's eye." Setting out under these false impressions, the detective at once went astray in his search, and could never get right again. He was a man of undoubted sagacity, had wide connections and sources of intelligence, knew the habits and characteristics of men in high as well as in low life, and was conversant with the ways of women, laby- rinthian as they are. But he was conversant chiefly with fallen angels, and those who have begun to fall. So when his attention, was directed to the fair sex he was prone to look downward not upward. His skill lay in sounding the depths of vice, not in measuring the altitudes of virtue. It was, moreover, a maxim with him that disguise and concealment were a part of women's nature, from which they derived a love of masks and mysteries, and whenever one of them gets into serious trouble, her first impulse is to change her name, either legally, or without the sanction of law. Thus, in all the inquiries he set on foot, he laid too little stress on the name of Qnilford; nor did he think of looking into the sedate, serious walks of life, or dream that one so capable of ex- citing admiration. would seek shelter-in a seclusion almost   SAINT CECILIA.        353 nunlike, and devote herself to the arduous occupation of a teacher. Nor was any fact of her previous life known to him which might call his attention that way; for, in all the answers made to the inquiries of the solicitors, no one alluded to or had heard of the year Miss Guilford had  spent as a pupil at Latimer Lodge. Great was the labor the detective underwent, voluminous his correspondence with his agents; and he was led off on many a false scent. But he was indefatigable. He felt that his reputation with four eminent solicitors was at stake. After some months he discovered that a lady cor- responding closely in age, person, and bearing with her whom he was in search of, familiar with at least one foreign tongue, and a gifted musician, had gone to the con- tinent some months before, under an assumed name and mysterious circumstances, with a well-known gentleman, more wondered at than approved of by his staid friends in England. The description tallied so exactly with thie lost lady that he could no longer doubt their identity. Procuring a conference with his principals, he communicated the re- silt of his inquiries, the evidence of its truth, and asked whether he should extend his search abroad. The three attorneys looked very blank at this news, and he who represented Mrs. Beresford, drawing out a letter, said, "I now understand this note which I lately received from my client. It has puzzled me much hitherto." And covering the signature, he let them read the few words it contained.  "I set out for Germany in the morning. Stop all in- quiry after Miss Guilford, and send your bill of expenses incurred. " The detective nodded his heal in approval of the testi- mony which confirmed his report; and the three solicitors, 30  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7202-00000178"/> 354        SAINT CECILIA. after a few words of consultation, resolved to discontinue further search until further instructions froml their clients. Old Riddell had rested his forehead, thoughtfully, on his hands; but he now looked up, and said, "The parsons tell us that by pride men and angels first fell. It may be so. But there is a kind of pride rhich holds men upright, and women too. When the affairs of McCauley &amp; Reid are so far wound up that a dividend can be distributed among  the creditors, Miss Guilford must be advertised for by name, and I warrant you she will turn up in quite a different quarter from what you expect."  His legal brethren shook their heads sadly; the detective did the same, with a sneer at the old gentleman's simplicity, and sine die the conference adjourned. Ormond's solicitor returned to his chambers deeply pon- dering the terms in whichi he should announce to his client the result of his search. From Ormond's last letter he rightly inferred the nature and intensity of the interest his client felt in Miss Guilford's fate. He shrank from conm- municating his own convictions. Having long been the  solicitor of the family, he had known Ormond's earnest and  impetuous character from boyhood, and he felt that in a matter of this kind he himself must make no mistake. Io  must not take a probability for a certainty. The infallille detective may have erred. So he wrote to Ormond, giving an account of the elaborate efforts imade by two other parties, unknown to him except through their attorneys, and the failure of all to trace Miss Guilford's movements.  All trace of her had been lost from the day she left London,  accompanied by her maid, except that a person strongly   4 resembling her had left England for the continent, under  mysterious circumstances, some months ago. H promised continued vigilance and activity; but did not conceal that  he no longer hoped for a successful result to the search.     . 'I   .......-4...        355 Months must pass before this communication could reach the hand and wring the heart of him to whom it was addressed. Lord Faringdon's solicitor was nearer to his client, which made the communication of his intelligence a yet more unpleasant task. With much circumlocution he de- tailed the measures taken to find the missing niece. Lord Faringdon turned restlessly in his chair, anxious, but striv- ing to control his anxiety. At length the attorney had to come to the detective's last intelligence, and to the laconic note received by Mrs. Beresford's attorney. During the latter part of his narrative the solicitor looked away from his client, who, indeed, had so turned that his face could not be seen. When the solicitor ceased speaking, Lord Faringdon sat still for some moments; then, rising in silence, he left the room and descended to the street. The footman, as he threw open the coach door for his master, remarked his blanched cheek, clouded brow, and compressed lips, and listened with wondering sympathy to the words he uttered as he stepped into the coach: "Too late! too late!" Monsieur Marigny, in the pursuit of his vocation, had just been giving a lesson to Lord Faringdon's youngest daughter, and was leaving the house when the porter threw open the door and my lord walked in. Monsieur no sooner saw him than he thought of Constance. Indeed, he thought of her often, but especially when he came to this house. Lord Faringdon seemed abstracted, and did not at first observe Monsieur. But when he did, he ad- dressed him by name, bowing politely before he passed him. Monsieur turned and bowed low enough for polite- ness; but the fat porter, who was holding the door open, was astonished at the cold, proud air, and the austere coun- tenance this poverty-stricken old Frenchmllan exhibited to  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7202-00000179"/> 356        SAINT CECILIA. my lord. Monsieur passed out bearing with him the secret Lord Faringdon would have given a manor to know. Lord Faringdon was a fond father, and when he entered. the drawing-room, striving to suppress all outward indi- cations of the painful emotions which had agitated him, his three daughters came around him; the youngest, Mon- sieur's pupil, still almost a child, urging some request. Putting his hand upon her head, he said, hurriedly, "Yes, yes," and turned hastily away, murmuring, "I have taken care of my own. But my brother's orphan daughter,-and her daughter,-where is she now? Too late! too late!" "The race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong " Mrs. Beresford had not entered on the chase with half the keenness of her competitors, yet the quarry was .destined to be hers. Her solicitor had kept her informed of his various but fiuitless efforts to find Miss Guilford. But intending to claim all the merit of success to himself, he had said nothing of the aid he was receiving from others en- gaged in the samne search. Mrs. Beresford was provoked at her disappointment, and disgusted at his want of sagacity and success. She began to be alarmed at the mysterious dis- appearance of one so nearly allied to her in blood, the blood of the ancient house of the Warrens of Polworth, whose pride even ruin could not tame. Still, confiding in her own sagacity, she yet hoped to unveil this mystery. But, after all, she owed her success to chance. On her annual visit to Brighton she was driving along the shingle beach, enjoying the delightful sea-breeze, watching the multitude of fishing-boats, hovering like sea-gulls on the surface of the waters, when a heavy shower coming up suddenly from the landside, she ordered her coachman to turn homeward. Soon she overtook a young governess in sore distress, hurrying on with two little goirls, wlom Mrs. Beresford recognized as children   SAINT CECILIA.        357 of a family whose lodgings were near her own. Stopping the carriage, she offered them seats and shelter, which were accepted with many thanks. While the governess was wiping the raindrops from the children's dresses with her handkerchief, she spoke to them in French, probably having been instructed to address them in no other language. Mrs. Beresford thought her accent unusually pure for a young English girl, and asked whether she had been at school in France. The young governess smiled as if flattered at this ques- tion, but said, "No, ma'am, I was educated at Latimer Lodge, in H-- shire. Great attention is paid there to the French language." "That attention was not thrown away upon you," said Mrs. Beresford, with a gracious smile. She was not one of those who think politeness to a governess casting pearls before swine. "Latimer Lodge?^' she said, repeating the name. "I never heard of that school before.'" The young governess thought, "What would be Mrs. Latimer's horror at such a confession 1" "Your teacher, no doubt, was a native of France," said Mrs. Beresford. "Yes, ma 'am, an old emigrant noble, and quite a culti- vated man. But, perhaps," she added, "I learned more of French from a young lady who was one of the scholars. She had lived some years in France, and longer in Ger- many, is at home in either tongue, and the most accom- plished person I ever met with." "Your field of observation, my good girl," thought Mrs. Beresford, " has not been very wide." But by way of something to say, she blandly asked, "What is the name of this accomplished young lady?" "Miss Guilford,-C0nstance Guilford," the governess answered.  &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7202-00000180"/> 358        SA INT CECILIA. Mrs. Beresford's eyelids opened wide, but she betrayed scarcely any other symptom of surprise. After a moment's pause she asked, in an indifferent tone, "Did you leave this young lady at Latimer Lodge?" "No, ma'am ; she went away before me, three years ago. But I hear that she has" since returned, and was lately there as a parlor-boarder." Mrs. Beresford said no more on this subject. She had learned all she need now know. She turned the conversa- tion by expressing the hope that neither the little girls nor the governess would take cold from the wetting they had got; and the carriage drew up, and they were put down at their own door. Mrs. Beresford, now verging on fifty, stood more in need of a skilful tire-woman than she had done twenty years ago  She had provided herself accordingly; and Mechn was an artist of exquisite taste and judgment in dress. But she was something more,-she possessed tact and address' in other matters than the duties of the toilet, and her mis- tress valued her for them. While Mrs. Beresford was dressing for dinner (and she expected several guests) she kept silence until Mechn had got through the most critical part of her duty, -the arrange- ment of her hair. But that done, she felt at liberty to call the artist's attention to matters foreign to her present task. "Pray, Mechn," said her mistress, " do you know of any one in Brighton who could supply your place for aL few days?"  Mechn made a thoughtful pause, not wondering at the question; for more than once had Mrs. Beresford dis- pensed with her attendance on her person to employ her in some transaction which required a judicious agent. Mechn was now running over the list of her acquaint- ance to see who might possilly serve as a substitute for   SAINT CECIIA.        359 herself. At length she said, "There is a young friend of mine here, ma'am,"-Mechn had a host of friends,-" who, with a few hints from me, might be trusted for a few days, if you will be content with -" "With less skilful hands and less exquisite taste tlan yours," said Mrs. Beresford, interrupting her, with a smile. "She must do, for I wish to send you on an important errand into one of the restern shires. You must have your wits about you if you would fulfil your mission well." Mechn pricked up her eairs at these words. She liked being trusted in important missions. She liked anything that savored of intrigue and adventure. She liked the prospect of being her own mistress for some days, and she expected to be well rewarded in case of success. Her mistress now directed her to go into H--shire and visit the village of Orton and its neighborhood, and learn all she could as to a school called Latimer Loldge, and ascertain whether Miss Constance Guilford was there, or where she could be found. Mechn was not only to learn all she could as to this young lady, but must herself see her and satisfy herself fully as to her looks, manners, temper, and attainments. But she was warned that, while endeavoring, to learn everything, she must cominunicate or betray nothing,--a charge often enjoined on diplomatic agents. Like a skilful spy, she was to observe Miss Guil- ford closely, yet escape her observation. Mrs. Bercsford had resolved to make some provision for her young kinswoman if she stood in need of it. But she chose to ascertain whether she would be a desirable inmate before she gave her it home in her own house. Mechn having received her instructions and funds for her journey, "stalled her deputy in office, and left Brighton next morn- ing. In passing through London she changed her name, dress, and character, and imade her appearance at the vil-  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7202-00000181"/> 360        SAINT CECILIA. lage of Orton as Mrs Cleverly, of London, a genteel young widow, past the mourning stage, and in search of a good school for her little daughter, of whoni she spoke with ardent maternal affection; a delicate child who needed country air. After satisfying herself on all points of her mission, she told her confidante, the innkeeper's wife, that Latimer Lodge would not do. The system of education was too exacting, and the confinement too great, for a puny girl like hers, and she niust look elsewhere. On her way back she stopped a day in London, to take a little pleas- are and do a little business on her own account, and then hastened on to Brighton to make her report. Meanwhile Mrs. Beresford had received a dispatch which Claimed her attention in another direction. Her daughter, Lady Colbrooke, wife of the ambassador to the small Ger- man court on whose policy the fate of Europe did not hang, while she enjoyed good health, gay company, and domestic comfort, had got on exceedingly well for three years without seeing her mother. Her letters indeed al- ways expressed the tenderest affection for her absent parent; for that parent had carefully instructed her in the itrt of letter-writing. But Lady Colbrooke often repeated that both public and private considerations kept the viscount at his post; and she always assumed that her mother, in visiting Germany, would sacrifice her comfort and derange her habits of life. Mrs. Beresford was reluctant to charge her own daughter with want of affection, but suDposed that Lord Colbrooke, for some reason, did not care to have his wife's mother long his guest. But Lady Colbrooke was now a second time "As women wish to be who love their lords;" and being in a critical condition, had been put under severe restrictions by her physician. Now, in the comparative   SAVI' CECILhA.        361 solitude of her chamber, she felt the want of her mother's care and society, and of the conversation of one so familiar with the persons and scenes among which Lady Colbrooke had spent hei sportive life. The mother's instincts were awakened in Mrs. Beresford. She only awaited Mechn's return to set out for Germany. But she listened eagerly to the news Mechn brought her. It was satisfactory beyond her hopes. The lost one was at last found, and was well worth finding; a pearl of great price. But on the eve of this hasty journey nothing could be done to secure it. Latimer Lodge was just the respect- able, safe, and secret cloister in which Miss Guilford could be left until Mrs. Beresford, on her return in a few months, might claim her young kinswoman. Meanwhile, remem- bering her instructions to her solicitor, she wrote to him three hasty lines, without stopping to choose her words: "I set out for Germany in the morning. Stop all in- quiry after Miss Guilford, and send your bill of expenses incurred.7 These words might imply that Miss Guilford was found, or despair of finding her, or the discovery that she was not w6rth finding.

CHAPTER XXIX. "Devise the fittest time, and safest way, To hide me from pursuit that will be made After my flight. Now go I in content, To liberty, and not to banishment."-As You LIKE IT. THE little world of Latimer Lodge was never more busy or prosperous than now. Under Mrs. Latimer's vigilant eye well-trained young teachers were working hard, at marvellously small salaries, in the hope of promotion through their patroness's influence, as well-paid govern- esses in wealthy households. For a penny in cash and a shilling in promises they were instilling into their pupils. a modicum of letters and science, and a more ample pro- ficiency in those arts which the world calls accomplishments. The professors of music, drawing, and the foreign tongues were the dignitaries of the establishment, and of necessity better paid than the small fry of teachers. Eminent among these magnates was that graceful gentleman, who made his appearance three times a week, violin in hand, and in- structed the young ladies, not only in the minuet, cotillon, waltz, and Spanish dances, hut in all the plysteries of graceful carriage, elegant postures, and personal demeanor. Mrs. Latimer was herself indefatigable in polishing her rough diamonds, and in giving them the most attractive set- ting, by imbuing them with refined tastes, elegant manners, address in conversation, and an orthodox training in the observances of " external religion," these being the step- ping-stones to the great goal of female ambition. Mrs. Latimer was in the highest condition of spirits,   -JSAINT CECILIA.         363 temper, and energy; for she was making rapid strides toward the object of her own peculiar ambition. Grinding down the subordinate agents who shared her labors, and levying contributions on patronizing fathers and mothers by selling them tinsel for gold, she was fast quarrying the stone and burning the lime which was to rebuild the house of Latimer: She had just lifted another mortgage on the remnant of the family estates, and the ship which bore the fortunes of the Latimers began to float lightly on the waters. In this busy little world Constance was not idle. She was revealing to her pupils as much of the mysteries of the French and German tongues as she could get them to embrace; she painted for love of art and need of guineas; and she acknowledged as a blessing the labor which filled up her hours, and weaned her thoughts from dwelling on the sad past and gloomy future. Her lot was indeed not without alleviation. Where much of youth is assembled there will be much of life and joy; and Constance was too young and buoyant in temper not to sympathize with those' around her, and even at times to take a part and the lead in their diversions. Slle was in high favor with -1Mrs. Latimer, who, perceiving that she had neither home nor friendshop, hoped, by a tone of affection which was almost motherly, to secure her valuable but unpaid services for a long term. She ,prized her not only as an assistant but as an agreeable companion, and a model to the young ladies, to whom, in her drawing-room of an evening, she gave her esoteric instructions and the las t polish before they went forth to seek their fortunes in the great world. For sone months after Constance had returned from London, little occurred to break the even tenor of her life. Her weekly services as leader of the choir were almost the only thing that carried her beyond the inclosures of the  &#xD;<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7202-00000183"/> 364        SAINT CECILIA. Lodge. These were at once a duty and a pleasure to her, and very important in Mrs. Latimer's eyes. Under the guise of a devotional exercise, it was far better than a standing puff in the "Times" as the means of making widely and convincingly known the high and peculiar merits of her seminary. Constance had no communica- tion with the great world outside of the parish of Orton, except one profitable transaction with the picture-dealer with whom she had last dealt. The receipt therefore of a letter was an event to her, especially as the seal bore the impression of a handsome coat of arms. Arriving with many others, it escaped Mrs. Latimer's vigilant eye, and was handed to Constance by one of the girls. She looked carefully at the seal. It was not the arms of the Guil] fords, nor of the Warrens, the only armorial bearings she was familiar with. Hastening to her room, she pro- ceeded to read the letter: "MY DEAR CONSTANCE,-I am sorry that I must begii my first letter to you with reproaches for the strange and ill-judged step you took on your return to England after the death of your excellent father. Apparently with- out making any attempt to communicate with your rela- tives, you at once buried yourself in the seclusion of the obscure school at which you had been in part educated. In your grief and desolation you seem to have thought that your only place of refuge. I am surprised that, even with your youth and inexperience, you should not have known that a young lady of your birth and connections can only find a proper home under the roof, or at least the sanction, of some near relative. Knowing the com- plete estrangement of your father from Lord Faringdon, I, as your nearest maternal relative, on hearing of your sad loss, daily expected to hear from you. Hearing neither   SAINT CECILIA.        365 from you nor of you, I made active and continued efforts to trace you. I had the most persevering inquiries made, at great cost, through various agents, but privately; as propriety forbade any publicity in so peculiar a case as a search after a young lady. All my efforts failed, and I was in despair. It was only lately, in an accidlntal in- terview with a young governess, that I heard ofTattimer Lodge, your education there, and your return thither as a parlor-boarder. Pray remedy your error as quickly as possible. Write to me at once, and name a day, that I may send my housekeeper, a most respectable woman, who has my full confidence, that she may bring you to me. "Your loving kinswoman, "ALICE BERESFORD." This letter almost took away Constance's breath. She had given up all hope of making herself known to her relatives, without appearing to obtrude herself upon them. But here was her mother's nearest relative, a well-hknown lady of fashion and fortune, come forward to claim her au- thoritativelv, as properly under her charge, and naturally a part of her household. The wlole tone of the letter was unlike what she would have expected from the dashing, selfish, and ambitious Mrs. Bcresford, of lwhom she had at times heard her father and mother speak. She read it again, and concluded that either Mrs. Beresford was much changed since they had known her, or that tley must have misunderstood her character. This letter called for a speedy answer. Yet Constance, in her uncertainty as to her new-found relative's true char- acter, was at a loss in what terms to reply to her. She at length wrote thus: "MY' DEAR MRS. BERESFORD,-I hasten to reply to you, botli to thank you for your kindness and to explain my con- 31*  &#xD;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7202-00000184"/> 366        SAINT CECILIA. duct. When I found myself desolate by my dear father's death I hurried back to England, in order to put myself under your protection. I had no fear of becoming a bur- den to you, as I knew that my father had accumulated in India more than a competence for me. On reaching London, my first care was to call upon his agent; fronm whom I learned the failure of the banking-house in Cal- cutta in which my little fortune was deposited. I was not prepared to throw myself as a beggar on your bounty, to whom I was utterly unknown. In Latimer Lodge a safe and unobjectionable home was open to me. But as the cost of living here would soon exhaust my means, at the end of a few months I accepted Mrs. Latimer's proposal that I should undertake the instruction of some French and German classes. This engagement compels me to forego my desire to see you at once; but two months hence, when the holidays begin, I will be delighted to come to you.

Comforting herself with this reflection,-for she was as much shocked at Constance's stooping so low as Lord N--  would be at finding the colt he was training for the Derby harnessed to the plough,-Mrs. Beresford wrote another epistle to the young lady who had so grievously misconceived what she owed to herself and her origin. "MY DEAR CONSTANCE,-I am delighted to hear from you; but must confess that there are some things in your letter that surprise and pain me. -You have shown dis- trust of your nearest kinswomal, and you have willingly stepped down from the position in which you were bound to make every effort to maintain yourself. But I find no fault with you for allowing your engagement with Mrs. Latimer to prevent your coming to me at once; for although such an agreement by a minor is not binding ia law, yet 'noblesse oblige' But I claim you the moment you are fiee to come. And that you may see that I do so on good grounds, I inclose you a letter I received from your father some months before his death. -In the mean time I must insist on one point. Fortune has much mis- placed a girl of your birth ifi your present position. You are thrown in contact and into intimate relations with persons you should never have known. When you are in your proper place, under my roof, they are not likely to cross your path. It is important to your success in life that your present occupation should not become known to your future associates. , You must therefore be absolutely silent as to your future prospects and your intention to leave  &#xD;<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7202-00000185"/> 368       SAINT CECILIA. Latimer Lodge: and you must appoint some place where, when the holidays commence, you can meet my house- keeper, whom I will send for you. To prevent awkward inquiries, you can then write to Mrs. Latimer that you have gone to live with your aunt, and will notreturn to her school. If you manage your retreat cleverly, no one will be able to trace your movements. I must add that in our childhood your mother and myself were for years brought up as sisters. You must therefore look upon me as your aunt; and in you I hope to find more than a niece. I remain until we meet, my dear Constance, Your loving and anxious kinswoman, "ALICE BERESFORD." This letter, from one who had never seen her, and knew nothing of her, but whose house and heart were thrown open to her as the daughter of Frances Warren, moved Constance much. There was no resisting this call, even if her father's letter had not made compliance with it as- sume, in Constance's eye, the shape of duty. Yet obedience with Mrs. Beresford's injunctions of secrecy involved a concealment foreign to Constance's open temper. But she at once wrote to Mrs. Beresford expressing her gratitude for her kindness, the longing she felt to be with her, and promising to obey her injunctions. The next two months were the most irksome Constance had spent at Latimer Lodge. She had to play a part not natural to her. With the secret intention of leavihg the Lodge never to return, she had to be on her guard against betraying her designs. In the large household around her she was about to leave many a friendly heart without one word of warning that they would see her no more. Why, even Mrs. Latimer deserved better treatment than this! She had, moreover, to contrive to leave the place   SAINT CECILLA.        369 under circumstances which would excite no surprise, yet involve no false statement as to her intention. Constance longed to see Mrs. Beresford. Was she like her mother? She hoped so. Was she like Mrs. Latimer? She hoped not. Yet many a lady would have been con- tent to resemble Mrs. Latimer in person as well as mind. Thinking of the fashionable lady she had heard her pa- rents comment on, and of the gay company she kept, and the brilliant fetes she gave when her daughter was unmar- ried and a belle, Constance suddenly remembered that her own wardrobe was unsuited even to the elegant rus- ticity in which Mrs. Beresford was now living; for, from motives of economy, Constance was one of the simplest dressers at Latimer Lodge, the scantily-paid young assist- ants not excepted She at once called in the aid of Miss Wilson, the vil- lage mantua-maker; and in order to provide an outfit worthy of the new sphere in which she was shortly to move, she made an inroad upon her hard-earned sovereigns, which one of the elaborate productions of her pencil barely replaced. But what route must she take to transfer her- self to this new sphere? After imuch thought she con- cluded that a second visit to London would aff6rd the greatest facilities for complying with Mrs. Beresford's in- junctions as to the secrecy of her movements. Having inquired of Mrs. Nelson, casually as it were, whether she would go again to London, and on what day, Constance wrote to Mrs. Beresford to send her housekeeper in due time to town, to await her coming at the "White Hart Inn." "Where will you   spend the holidays, Constance?" Mrs. Latimer asked, as this critical time drewinear. r. "I think of going to London again," Constance an- swered, striving to assume a tone of indifference, and then  &#xD;<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7202-00000186"/> 370        SAINT CECILIA. hastened to broach another topic to avoid being questioned further. Although the inmates of the Lodge had seen and ad- mired some few of Constance's drawings, she had guarded her paintings from all prying eyes. But Mrs. Latimer knew, through her old Scotch spy, that Constance occa- sionally sent off to London a carefully-packed box, long, wide, and shallow, and directed to a picture-dealer. She even knew that she had changed her picture-dealer. It was natural that the artist should pay a visit to town on business connected with her art. Mrs. Latimer felt con- fident that Constance's gains were not large enough to render her independent of Latimer Lodge, and asked no more questions. Indeed, to avoid further questioning from any quarter, Constance kept herself much occupied. She habitually read a good deal during her little leisure from other occupations, and now she seemed often absorbed by the interest of her book. She had preserved a good many mementos of her for- mer life; and now, to give compactness to her luggage, she sent off a well-packed box by the carrier to London, to wait for orders there. Abandoning an old trunk or two, and several old dresses, and other articles, she, in a little spirit of mischief, arranged them artistically, so as to break the air of empty desolation in her room after her departure. When she had completed this arrangement, she sat down and cried. She was half sorry, half glad, yet could not but feel that all this concealment and mys- tery were closely allied to falsehood. On this, the eve of the holidays, she made her arrange- ment with Mrs. Nelson to travel to London under her protection. When she looked round on the familiar faces she was soon to see no more, she found it difficult to re- strain her tears. She felt that hers was an ungracious   SAINT CECILIA.        371 parting with not a few friends. But everybody was busy and joyous, and had no leisure to remark her agitation. In the morning when, in the bustle of departure, all were exchanging farewells, she felt at liberty to yield to the warnmth of her attachments and regrets. Mrs. Latimer was the last person of whom she took leave. As Con- stance offered her hand, Mrs. Latimer drew her to her and kissed her tenderly, exclaiming, gaily, as she released her, "Au revoir!" Constance had learned to know Mrs. Latimer well. She was too direct not to detect that lady's many indi- rections in the pursuit of the one ambition of her life. For herself and others, Constance had much to forgive her; yet she felt that she owed her much. Kindness and con- sideration, from whatever motive they may be shown, will tell. Constance leaned forward, and, throwing her arms around Mrs. Latimer, kissed her warmly, leaving that lady's cheek wet with her tears. It was the kiss of pardon and- of peace. On the second evening after leaving the Lodge, Con- stance and her companion reached London.  Having transferred their luggage to a hackney-coach, Mrs. Nelson expected to hear Constance order the coachman to drive to the BWest End of London, where Monsieur Marigny lived. Instead of that he was ordered to the "White Hart Inn," near at hand. In answer to Mrs. Nelson's look of surprise, Con- stance said, "I expect to find a friend waiting for me there." Arriving in a few minutes, Constance inquired of a waiter, who had stepped promptly forward, whether Mrs. Meadows, an elderly lady, was not there waiting for Miss Guilford. "Mrs. Meadows has been here some hours," the waiter answered, " expecting a party of that name."  &#xD;<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7202-00000187"/> 372        SAINT CECILIA Mrs. Nelson's curiosity was roused. "Who can Mrs. Meadows be?' Constance ordered her luggage to be taken off, handed the fare to the coachman, and turning to her companion, shook hands with her tremulously and heartily, thanking her for her protection and kind- ness. As she was turning away, Mrs Nelson exclaimed, "But where shall I call for you on my way back to the Lodge?" "I will not put you to that trouble," Constance replied, bowing kindly to Mrs. Nelson, and turning away to avoid further question. "What will Mrs. Latimer say!" exclaimed Mrs. Nelson in a tone of alarm, while she watched Constance, who, following her luggage into the inn, now vanished forever from the eyes of the little world in and around Latimer Lodge.
