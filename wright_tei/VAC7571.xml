ELIZABETH BARNES RICHARDS, Authoress of "THE STREAMLET," and "' THE TWO COUSINS." Strange hidden mysteries lie buried 'neath Yonder confused mass of ancient, ghostly pile, blind travels onward, and brings from the rubbish Living forms! Soon light and reason dawns, And Truth comes marching up the dreamy lane. MRS. RTCaWB. WORCESTER: PRINTED BY ADAMS &amp; BROWN, 212 Main Street. 1864.  &#xD;<pb n="0" xml:id="VAC7571-00000002"/>  Entered according to act of Congress in the year 1864, by Gardner N. Cobb, in the Clerk's Otfice of the District Court of Massachusetts.   INTRODUCTION. The authoress has contemplated writing this work many years. Two years since it was commenced, then suspended on account of her ill-health Again was it renewed, and after much mental labor, it is now completed, on the author's birth-day, June fifth, eighteen hundred and sixty-two. The pages of this narrative are like a chain, con* necting truthful incidents, soul-stirring scenes, sing- ular- mysteries; then the reader is hurried away to some far-off land, where strange visions meet the view. There are incidents of war, treachery,-then light, joy, love, and religion dressed in her purest garb; all terminating in peace at the same harbor And that which must be pleasing to the reader is that the sweet bird of Truth -flutters over each page. The rustling wings of this celestial songstress may be heard with her cheering voice, gently warblingD from one page to another, througlout the entire his- tory. ,We trust that this is a healthy and instructive volume, as well as an amusing one; and we trust that the notes of the above-mentioned bird may not be entirely unappreciated. Truth may bear away in all her beautiful, mighty strength; but there id )  &#xD;<pb n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC7571-00000003"/> VI                i o writer, however cautious, who may pass through the highways and by-lanes of author-ship, let them ceeck their pages from whatever shrub or tree that they choose, who is not obliged, in a greater or less degree, to wrestle with public censure. The poor Muse sometimes gets a tremendous shaking for her untiring efforts to please the great mass of readers. The humble writer of this volume, 'tis hoped, may receive as gentle a nudge as possible from those who may peruse the following pages. We feel ourselves at liberty to assert that she has not deviated any farther from the high standard of veracity than any writer has an undoubted right to- do. If a warp is to be drawn into a loom, what is it without filling? Why, good for nothing, of course. Hence, if writers have the firm earthwork of facts to build their atory upon-facts, whether past or present--even if far back in the dim shadow 'of Oblivion, there will be barriers to stumble across, and o'erleap. Our motto is: Let each and every author choose his (or her) own mode of dressing up their facts or ideals. We think that there will be no necessity for our readers to exclaimn: "Oh! there is not enough interest in this volume to protract the reading!' Readers, please bear in mind that we are narrating a story which is literally true, though true names are withheld, as well as many of the localities. The bird   VII "Press Onward" will flutter his plumed wings over these pages until three little letters show themselves: viz. END. Every thread in this story has, wethink, its own proper locality; every mystery, however triv- ial, will duly and consistently be cleared. The omit- ting of any point requisite to bringing forth a plain understanding has been studiously avoided. Exciting incidents are scattered throughout thesepages. The unblemished life of Deacon Pyrone and his ami- able daughter Amelia; the lovliness, benevolence and heroism of Elisiner, and the strange vicissitudes which attended the life of the student, Clarence Ner- vourn, throws an interest through the whole Christian lovliness and purity, with some of natures beauties, fraught with true romance, go hand and heart through the entire history. To-day is this work completed. ELIZABETH BARNES RICHARDS. June 5, 1862,  &#xD;<pb n="viii (Table of Contents) -ix (Table of Contents) "

Par back in the dim vista of years, a noble shi rode proudly onward upon the restless 'bosom of  deep, bearing within its strong, but transitory h1 / many a beating, anxious heart. But none more wild, and fraught with deeper emotions of uncertainty than the young, enthusiastic Ralph Barnsford Pyrone, just hailed with his bride from the- shores of old England. A quarrel with his rich old father, who was a baronet, was the direct cause of his flight. The young man had secured a large amount of gold which he bore along with him.         . Boston, at this time, was little more than a marshy tract of land. After remaining for a brief time in this locality, himself and wife, together with a few newly acquired acquaintance, all of whom were as 2  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7571-00000007"/> " desirous as himself of starting for NFew Iampshire and of clearing , and settling down in their Log cabin homes, not nr from the ndprowling bear Mountains. The wild Indian, and prowling bear, together with other ferocious animals, formed the principal inhabitants. Every one knows with what rapid strides the white population and civilization have made their advances into the heart of our Northern wilds; the swaying, and total dispersion of our poor red brothers. Many years elapsed, and Barnsford, together with many of his descendants, had fallen asleep, resting 'neath the dark murmuring pine, and tall mountain ash of the forest." Not, however,-before some per- mnanent advances had been made towards erecting a inane'ubut tron house, partly composed of stones small, but strong years, ]Ralph Itogister Pyrone, and logs.

Here the true Republican had   15            * received many a -heart wound from the British, in the days of the Revolution. The turbid waters of life had rolled through the once green pastures of life's journey. Departed forms of other years often haunted the dark cham- bers of the soul. The sweet, low voice of prayer had often been heard at the lone midnight hour. Pure young Love, in its earliest dawn, with her white wings, breathed out her unadulterated. atmos- phere here.  Sprightly Mirth danced with unlimited sway. Here the unfortunate found a resting place from many of the storms of life. * It is within this old stone mansion that our story commences. "What, Elisiner, do I again find-you absorbed in deep rooted meditation? too deep, it seems, to bestow even a passing thoughts upon one, who would crave the sweet privilege of classing herself among your dearest friends." A beautiful, yet sad countenance was turned towards the gentle interrogator. "Ah! dear Foresetta, my heart throbs with happi- ness, whenever your kind tones are heard. The shave an enlivening influence upon my soul." But I supposed, dear Elly,-rhen I came, that your thoughts were far away ; wandering, perhaps, in some foreign clime; or may be, gazing into the bright waters of the Oneida, or perchance, assisting some dark -maiden of the wild, shadowy forest, in malting the beaded moccasin.  Dear Ellia, was it not so?" A gentle smile stole softly over the fine features / of Mrs. Ellia Elwell, the young wife of Byron Elwell. "Come, Elly, throw these musty old books away. Do leave this old garret. One would suppose thbat your love of life consisted in peering out of dingy, dusty windows, to gaze upon the stars. For. my part, I do not think them very luminous to-night.  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7571-00000008"/> 16 Come! Come! Elly, if your dear nun-like self holds such frequent converse with the heavenly con- stellations, for once descend from your lofty position, and impart some ray of knowledge to your stupid, but interested friend, I fain would become your pupil. Dear Elisiner, do not look so reprovingly, and I will away with such absurd nonsense; I will desist alto- gether." After a brief pause, Foresetta commenced speaking in a low tender tone:-      . "But really, Elly, I cannot perceive what attrac- tions there are in an old upper loft like this one, which you appear so much in love with. In my opinion, old musty papers and books, all besprinkled with cobwebs and dust, are enough to sicken any merry heart." A tear was all the answer Foresetta received from her companion. This youthful friend little suspected that she had unconciously touched a cord that was entwined around the words which had just escaped her. Yes, words intervened with the Past and Pres- ent destiny of her highly-prized friend. Ah ' twas thus she discomfited sank, Midst the shattered remnants of other days, The placid fountain where once she drank The dark and sunless days, Again with mad'ning force swept through her soul, And bounded on without control. ' Foresetta Walsington, the young lady whom we have introduced, had recently become a very dear friend of the lady, who makes one of the principal characters of our coming history. At this period, Miss Walsingworth was spending a few days with a Mrs. E   -, her husband and infant son, who had lived for some time at a quaint old house in B- . The original owner of this antiquated edifice, long   17 ere our story commences, had passed away. The surrounding scenery of this somewhat secluded place was  romantically  beautiful! ., Like  m ost  such  placess; it had fallen into bther hands, and dropped into sad neglect; though the mists of inattention could not: divest this once cherished domain of its lofty gran- deur. Mr. E----  was a gentleman possessing a handsome competency, and had secured a five years lease of this mansion. Therefore, at this time, the- place had commenced to assume an appearance as ,( This attic," remarked Mrs. E--- , in reply to her friend "  hath charms for my heart, which rested -neath a heavy shadow; its pages are untold." Yes, a shadow rests upon the heart, alas! thick as. the heavy folds of the tomb. But taat heart was a brave one, sacred and pure as the mountain snow. "These ancient relies forcibly remind me of a spa-, cious garret in a house where I spent a part of my girlhood, in a beautiful, retired spot in the town, of The proprietor was a wealthy gentleman,; who had married my mother's eldest sister. in this rural home I spent many years. Here sunshine and sadness gleamed alternately o'er my younglife's pathway. In retirement I found my sweetest enjoy- ment. You, my young friend -Foresetta, may think it singular that one so extremely young as myself at that time, should be thus inclined. But, there are generally causes, and such causes carry things into effect. I consider this very time, Elisiner; we are too' apt to judge hastily from  appearances, without beingg aware of  thetrue causes." .: "Dear friend Ellia, I fear my thoughtlessness wwi;- untimely. If so, I beg your pardon." "You have no such boon to crave, Forra." Thank you., But how I do wish that you wouit favor me with some of- your past history."   &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7571-00000009"/> 18 "i in this case, Forra, confidence must beget confi- deuce." "And you shall have 4 unreservedly," answered Foresetta.; "You are intending to stop here the remainder of this, and the ensuing week. Mr. Elwell intends to be absent upon business some days, abouut that .per- plexing railroad affair. In all probability we shall be alone. As a diversion, I will endeavor to rehearse some few incidents of my earlier life, Before the blight of woe came through The lonely way to pale the cheek,  And scar the heart. But there is one weighty impediment that must be removed." "What can that be?" said Foresetta. "-Any- thing that will prove a hindrance to one pleas'it ' anticipated plan?" Yes, Forra, a serious hindrance." "' Natme it, Ellia, I do not comprehend your mean- ing. "Then my youngfriend must become disenchan- t d," said Mrs. Elwell. "Of what, and whom?" eagerly inquired 'For- esetta. "Of -the frequent calls which you receive when you visit this place; of -Hannibal Semond-poor sillyy youth t ," : ",Oh, Ellia, extend a little complacency upon this strange wooing of mine, and the luckless -German "Forra, excuse me, but you are acting a wrong :rib, o:ne beneath your notice. The heart should not be the plaything of any one; even if this heart be located in'the less sensible, discerning bosom. "Tis uinki-id, and unchristian, deserving of the eensure of every honest, upright heart." *  *   19 "I really hope that no ill will come from this thoughtless flirtation with the poor lad, for I sonhe- what pity him," said Foresetta sadly. ' I think that Captain Dunbar would disapprove of such an unwise course. And moreover, Forra, this youth is the only child of his mother, and this mother was :the nurse of your betrothed husband's father, old mayor Dunbar. No hand rendered more effectual aid than his, in arranging his dying pillow. this woman was considered by those who employed, her, as an excellent nurse. You know that she is now dead, having taken that same cruel fever which con- v veyed from this world -the well tried Christian, your lover's father."  "Yes, Ellia, I confess that what you have been saying is quite true. Your views upon this affair are correct. But if the poor fellow finds solace in seeing me, knowing as ie does, that in his mother's life- time, I often befriended her; why not allow him to come here sometimes, Ellia?  Surely, you do n ot suppose that I would intentionally refider him still more wretched. I pity himr for his very simplicity, and think that if by talking with him, I may in a measure mitigate his grief for the loss of his mother, I can safely do so." "Forra, you termed this youth 'poor fellow.' Yes, in truth, he is such. He raves about his -home in Groves Nerd Valley, in his native land, Germany. He informed me yesterday that he was going back, and none other than yourself was to accompany him thither." ,i "Indeed this is a new  piece of itelligen  ' Laughingly said Eoresetta.  -. "This corroberates my statement of 'poor felloW said Mrs Elwell. "What bould induce hid to thinki thus? This is the very point I was wishing to arrive   &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7571-00000010"/> 20  i ! at, Fedra. You must be aware that he is not blessed with that abundance of discernment which many persons have, and he takes it for granted that you are serious, when you forget your pity for him, for the loss of his mother, and unmeaningly encourage, him with your attentions." "And you, my sage friend, would have me desist both from pity and nonsense?" "No, you may hold to the pitying process, that can do no harm. But you should discard your man- ner of amusing yourself with his credulity." "1 will hereafter abide implicitly by your sympa- thetic advice, Ellia. - But all this is-to no purpose; or rater, not what I wish. I am all obedience, and will promise anything if you will unbar some of the bolts which have been such faithful protectors of your heart's domain." "Well, Forra, you have called me a nun. This one little word racked the ashes from the slumbering embers which, for many years, have lain partially dormant. You, my friend, must turn for a while into the path of nun sisterhood, whilst you are my listener. Though you may not like the cognomen of a nun, you may, perhaps, become more reconciled to it when I tell you that I have a beautiful cousin, who is leading a holy, devoted life, and I think I may say a useful one, in the seclusion of a convent. Yes, I have no objections to become a nun." A letter, the ensuing evening from young Captain Dunbar, to his affianced bride,. Foresetta, prevented a  ger continuance of this pleasant visit. It was a d upon, however, that this visit should be finish- t  in about five weeks:; Autumn would then be here; l  this rich season, succeeding her loving sister summer, was convivial with colors rich and grand. Speaking in gentle, yet impressive language of   21 the different stages in the brief life of mortals-how feeling, and how vivid is man's existance portrayed by the seasons of the waning months. The friends parted the next day; Miss Walsing- worth, in company with her lover Captain Dunbar. Evening came. Oh, how quiet!  "Peace breathes along the shade Of every hill; The tree tops of the glade Are hushed and still; All woodlands cease, The birds to rest within the brakes are gone; Be patient weary heart.-anon! Thou, too, shalt be at peace!" Dear reader, perhaps you dislike lingering thus long upon the threshold of our histor. But we beg you to be patient, and bring the old adage to mind- "There are buds before flowers." Clouds and minds are antecedants of approaching storms. It is thus through our changing voyage of life. Reader, if you please, we will linger awhile around the domains of this ancient house, where resides sh- who is destined to be the adorning star of these pages. Earthly stars, however; are meagre in com- parison to those which adorn the faroff world, ap- pearing to our own view like the holy eyes of angels, looking pityingly upon the frail, erring children of Man. Sweet are -the reflections at late evening, as we turn our eyes from  the quiet, starry dome of heaven, to the clotted world-our eyes resting on the almost unnumbered beauties, viewed by the calm light of the sweet, silvered queen of night. The writer would ask what is better calculated to draw the soul up to the Father of Majesty and Love. The inner soul seems to lose all hold upon the insig.;t nificant world. But when these soul soaring wings awaken, and descend again to settle the mind in its                          i  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7571-00000011"/> usMal sphere of worldly cares and: toils, the heart not unfrequently sickens, that its earthly mission is not ended, so that the soul may forever dwell in that  beautiful region, where congenial spirits may ever mngle with the pure and holy, the redeemed of. Christ. The writer will again beg pardon for this brief diversion from the story ; but will 'add that her medi- tative indulgencies are of-such frequent' occurence, that we hope forbearance will not be witheld. We will pass over the moonlit scenes, and sm'ile sweetly as we pass the couch where Sleeps Mrs. Ellia Ellwell, the velvetcheek of the cherub boy resting close to her own.         - Chilly winds are blowing through the Autumnal foliage, though all is still beautiful. There is a small, yet green island, scarcely one hundred feet in circumference; in bright Summer time nearly hidden from view by the high, sweeping, umbrageous foliage of the ash, and other forest trees; whose leaves leap and dance like creatures of life. High rocks sur- round this island, covered with a rich carpet of  green moss, and brownish turf, where a few wild ' flowers still linger. Now the horizon is darkened. Gray clouds fringed with black, are obscuring the dim blue sky. No immediate storm is apprehended; only old -Winter has conmissioned his chilly votaries to inform  his subjects of milder climes, that he intends soon to invade our territories in his cold, triumphant car. These sCenes--they haunt me still; Their tow music is in my dreams, and Comes booming o'er the hill! A carriage rolls slowly up the North avene lead-   king to the old mansion: A varigated cloud- of faliels Autumn leaves are borne aloft by the w ind, in close "proximity to the, half-opened porch door, and partially concealing the symmetrical form of its present mis- tress; Mrs Ellis Elwell. The -winds, sweep Aonwird, bearing in- its mad frolic the tiny flower blossoms, iwhich have recently separated themselves from the i parent stem, and nestle upon the brown earth at the foot of their maternal home. The noisy wind-spirit howls in every crevice of the old house; where its - voice can make an impression. But its tones are - unheeded by the occupants, for they are agreeably entertaining themselves in a very engrossing conver- sation. The trio-consisted of -Mrs. Elwell, and the gentleman and lady who had- recently arrived in- -the above mentioned'carriage who proved to be- none other than our friend Foresetta, and her lover Cap- tain Dunbar. Sweetly rolls the barge of pure friendship! the white sails unfurled, flitting to the breeze like an unpinioned bird. Now the breat:h of perfumed roses is blended with the celestial odor-of untainted friend- ship, and wafted to the hearts of God's children. The feelings of our young friends upon this evening, -were fraught with many sweet, cherished thoughts. - The gale is hushed, and a warmer,- gentler breeze fans the cheeks of the coippany ; as though- the wild boy, Wind, had repented of his recent pranks, wish ing to make amends for his tnad frolics, /by kissing the scattering flowers, and shrubbery with itis milder breath. Twilight is gently stealing adown the hill- slope, wrapping all nature in its soft, mysterious I gloom. How beautiful is Nature in her sweet repose! The vault of heaven, on' this day, wore a dress- of I the deepest azUre; the " King of Day bade a loving "'good night" to; the inhabitants of the earth,  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7571-00000012"/> 24 bathing the lofty mountains, smaller, wooded sum: mits, lovely vales, and singing streamlets in its pure golden light. Oh, how gloriously magnificent is the sunset hour! Life's varied scenes crowd to our memory; the soul is wrapt in solemnity, and sweet and mighty thought. Eternity, and a Redeemer's Iove, bears upon the mind; the cross of Jesus, lately looked at in the dim distance, now rises before us, divested of the thick, mysterious veil which has hitherto obscured it from our view; and now the tear of Hope, Faith . and Love is witnessed and remembered by the recor- ding angels in heaven. Reader,- we will impose upon ourselves the pleas- urable responsibility of relating the interesting story of Elisiner, according to the best of our ability; aiming not to detract one iota froum its truthful merit, neither to add one tint to its " silver lining." Some years previodas to -the opening of our story, on just such a day and eve as that which we have deliniated, Elisiner Hovert was left alone, with the exception of a curly-haired lad of twelve summers; a petted grandchild of her uncle, old Deacon Pyrone. At this time Elisiner was seated in a remote chami ber of the house, in company with her friend Fores- etta Walsingworth,--whom we have previously allu- ded to,-engaged in rehearsing a part of the history of her early life. "Yes, my dear friend Foresetta," she remarked; "this chamber very forcibly reminds me of pay own chamber, one of the cosiest little spots I ever-knew. Where the heart grew wild with joy, Or sickened with despair. Perhaps you would smile were I to tell you of the dark storms, which, from time to time, crept about,   and through this old garret. Why, Forra, you're shuddering!? e "What, Elly,' she exclaimed; "was ever a mur- der committed within the precincts of this place?" Ah! what a shadow flitted over the face of Elisi- ner, at her companion's question. But reader, you, too, as well as our young friend at Foresetta, may chance to inquire into this subject. Throw on the mantle of Patience, and all will in good time, imnmerge from the present cloud of mys- tery, and appear in a garb as light as noonday. Perhaps a tear may drop from your eyes, a/s from the eyes of the one of whom we write, when the slum- bering memories of years were aroused from their dormant state. We have said that sunshine, as well as sadness, had shone around the pathway of our young friend. And it is thus with us all; to-day we discern naught save a sable cloud, in our future; to- morrow, the sun may burst through with transcen- dant lovliness! The chamber where Elisiner sat, reminded her, as we have mentioned, of a certain little sanctum which had once been her own. The East winig had been built on to the main building, some thirty years pre- vious to the time of her residence there; the upper story of the wing had ever since been termed the "little' East garret."  The wall of this old stone edifice loomed far up th6 east wing, whilst a low, old- fashioned biaclk tower arose, ird threatening position, overlooking the Eastern addition, in one of Nature's lovliest spots. The woodbine crept over the windows of the little East garret; and when Elisiner threw A open the sash, to admit the pleasant breeze, a balmy sweetness often floated towards her from these vines. I1n one place, the tendrils of the woodbine crept ! through a broken pane, and in Autumn, the' bright  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7571-00000013"/> 26 red berries strewed the sill, and floor. Precious freight! Elisiner gently parted the vines in the centre, where she could gaze out, and rest her eyes upon the lovely scenespresenting themselves to her view. - It was a varied,land lovely prospect. Hills and vales, orchards and pastures, and the ornamental flower gardens, and useful kitchen beds; also the long barn, whose strong scaffold groaned beneath -their loads of sweet-smelling hay. Perhaps it might offend the fastidious ear should we prolong our description of the barn's enclosures. Why, what beauties are to be discoverd in a barn- yard? -Many! At least, our friend Elisiner highly appreciated a trip to the territory of the barn. In- teresting herds of gentle cows; flocks of snow-white sheep, driven at every sundown to their folds, atten- ded by the frolicking lambkins; doves flying to and fro; the prancing, high-mettled steed, and intersper- sion of poultry. But, reader, we will return to the retreat of Elisi- ner-the old East garret, where solitude reigned supreme. Willie, the little grandson of-rthe deacon, was  busily engaged in feeding his doves, and the flock of half-grown geese; watching, with appar- ent delight, the former, as they went in and out of the long range of nicely made boxes. As I have said, Elisiner was left alone, to pursue her own course of reflection, unmolested. The pano- rama of the events of many years appeared succes- sively before her mental vision; she seemed to hear again the accents of her kind father's voice, the pressure of a mother's warm kiss upon her cheek, and the clasp of her sister's arms about her neck. It was, perhaps, quite as well that this waking dream was broken by the noisy frolics of Willie and   127 Tiger on the green sward; as, in glee, they rolled over the falling leaves which,.ere strewn about in such profusion in the back yard. :Now a tiny mouse capers over the heaps of news- papers, that are lying promiscuously over the garret floor; then, with a leap, alights upon an old, dust- covered mirror-frane, which was suspended about a foot from the heavy plank floor; now he takes a side-  long view of Miss Elisiner, peering at her with his cunning black eyes, as if to say: ,4 What, intruder! here again?   How dare you so constantly intrude upon our. premises! Most assuredly, these garrets belong only to rats and mice."  But this little mis- chievous creature was so accustomed to Eiisiner's presence, that it constantly nibbled ;at a bit of dry bread, or a stray ear of corn, only a few yards froin her feet. Our amiable friend was not an individual to consider every creature, if not subservient to her wishes, as deserving to be deprived of its life. Reader, perhaps you, as well as ourselves, do not stand in the light of advocates for rats and mice. An unmarried lady, a firequent visitor at the old stone mansion, never honored the precincts of an old garret with her presence, quite sA  in-her opinion that it might be a famous place for i light tip-toe spirits." And, moreover, she often  affirmed that she would rather part with her large silver snuff-box, than to spend an hour after sundown in an old garret. But reader, you must not suppose that such suppositions had any weight upon the mind of our young friend Elisiner. If any person gives credence to visitations of supernatural beings, why, let them enjoy that belief, as we would not contest their way of thinking. Only will-we take the liberty to say that we do not doubt but that there are guardian spirits continually hovering around us, though invis- INg rondu'sthouh   nvs  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7571-00000014"/> 28 ible. But ah! who would think of shrinking at the prospect of beholding some dearly-loved departed one, from the "Spirit Land"! Elisiner was not fearful of meeting any of the above mentioned fraternity; for her's was a brave, --^yet gentle spirit, which would shrink from nothing as soon as doing wrong. The maid had lingered -hours-nay, weeks, within the large garret, with naught save her own meditations for company; look- ingo, and wondering at the curious, old-fashioned things which she saw, and searching amidst the rub- bish for hidden curiosities. Then would she retreat to her own sanctum, by descending four or five steps, when a door opened im- mediately into the " little East garret." This apart- ment, compared to the larger garret, was something like a tiny miniature, beside ai full-sized portrait. She had been deeply absorbed with her reflections for some time, scanning the several phases of her young life's' drama, as they successively arose before her mental vision ; when suddenly, her reverie was inter- rupted by the rich, deep-toned voice of Clarence Ner- vourn; this young lady's friend, and, we may say, her instructor. hs gentleman possessed a head well supplied with scientific knowledge; at this period of our history, he was drinking these draughts in the classic halls of A   , which would ultimately tend to promote the round of usefulness which he had so long premeditated, and which he would event- ully accomplish, if health and prosperity crowned-- his efforts. This gentleman was Elisiner's senior by several years.              :, "Come, Elisiner," he said, (' will you go on an exploring expedition this afternoon, with your hum- ble friend?" Elisiner had arisen from her low seat as soon as   ,   29 she recognized her visitor. She did not care so much ,about becoming a tourist, but she knew that she should be laughed at if she refused; for her friend had often, in a playful manner, alluded to the mar- ked preference which she evinced for this ancient attic. Hand in hand, these two ransacked old boxes and musty chests, untill enally a sickening sensation came over the young girl, whether it was from the damp air which arose from the chests when the lids were raised, or something different, we cannot say. She remarked to her companion that they had better postpone their explorations for the present; adding that it was time for her to go below, to prepare for tea. Elisiner was leaning against an old secretary, her cheek resting upon her hand, as she said this; as she awaited a response, she was startled by a low, half-smothered groan from Clarence, who was stan- ding close to a tall, ancient chest of drawers. She instantly started towards him, and saw that his face was as white as marble, his eyes were wild in their expression, whilst a tremor agitated his manly form. Elisiner inquired what had troubled him. "Oh, nothing," he answered, forcing a smile. "This morning when I arose, I had a very trouble- some headache. And instead of taking my accus- tomed walk by the river, I confined myself for two hours in my room, preparing my declamations for the ensuing week. And;" he continued, "my walk from the village hither has been so rapidly per- formed, that it tired me." "Why in such haste, Clarence?" "    I was impatient to visit you, my little nun, " he 'replied, at the same time pressing a kiss upon her Acheek. After descending  the stairs, Clarence turned i                      *-   &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7571-00000015"/> 30 around, observing that he must take a peep into Elly's little sanctum; meaning the little old East garret. Elisiner thought much of this conversation, and the playful mannerher companion tried to assume, in order to disguise his real perturbation. She tried not to betray her interest, but determined in her own mind that, at some future time, she would search through the drawers of this old chest. She was impressed with the idea that the singular manner of her friend was in some way connected with the mys- teries of the old chest. Meanwhile, Clarence kept on, until he was within the cosy precints of the little East garret. 4 Oh, what a charming spot," the lover remarked, seating himself upon a low, tattered ottoman. "It is a fit retreat for the muses to congregate, but not for you, my little maid," he added, taking her hand. And the gentle pressure it received sent a thrill of unspeakable joy through her young, confiding heart. This amiable girl experienced a happy, assuring feel- ing that she was in the presence of a noble being, whose mind was the seat of every pure, high-sou]ed  principle. Her very existence seemed so entirely j blended with his, that had she even vaguely dreamed of a separation, her heart would have become deeply pained.  "Why, Clarepce?"  I will sift this remark explicitly, my Elly. You  are naturally of a sad temperament; and here, in  time, you may imbibe a deep-rooted pleasure for  solitude, which will eventually unfit you for the  E duties of' life; and--"          .! "Well, well," she said, playfully interrupting  the loved speaker "It is my duty now to descend  to the kitchen to prepare tea; for if your walk hither    31\; has been performed so rapidly, you must stand greatly in need of immediate refreshment." ( Ah, what a little angel you are, Elly!" "Not an angel-you don't mean that, Clarence?"  said the young girl, half-reprovingly. "Thank you for that sweet rebuke, my little monitress."  Tea being finished, and no allusion being made to the exploring expedition in the little East garret,  "the marvellous and mysterious slept together."  In the meantime, the hired man Benson had. returned, and after eating his supper, he and faithful Phil engaged themselves about their sundown work. Little Sally was expeditiously wiping the tea-dishes so as to join Willie and merry little Hattie Williams, who were watching the chickens going to roost. Old Tiger seemed to be challenging Mr. Nervourn to engage in an old-fashioned romp over the grounds; but the latter had anticipated a walk with Elisiner, so Tiger's invitation was utterly disregarded for a season. Such rambles possessed: peculiar attractions for our - nature-loving student. Hill-tops, bearing on their brown and green bosoms, venerable trees, with their proud, ancient heads towering nearly to the purple tinted clouds; watching the folding of the little wild flowerets, and. listening to the tinkle of the murmuring brook in the distance, the surrounding  scenery growing less and less distinct, aa twilight gathered her soft mantle around all things, thus  warning our contemplative friends that her less accommodating sister, Darkness, was fast stealing 'upon their footsteps.              T But Oh! when the drapery of night is flung aside, and the mild moon sends her chaste beams over earth scenes-how beautiful!"Hail, sweet Orb!"  ' t\        -.*  ,   &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7571-00000016"/> 32 When our young pair returned to the mansion, they found that the family had returned. Mr. Davids, a neighbor, had also called in to pass an evening, with his flute. Then Clarence was invited to favor the company with a few of the deacon's. favourite airs; sacred music preferred, of course, the reader may conclude. No; our good deacon was no Bigoter, nor over righteous man; lbt a person of good, plain, common sense, living faithfully to that which is written in the sacred  "Volume  of Inspiration." O  D  Q  ,     ^  e o    f D About two weeks after Mr. Nervourn had left--, a goodly number of neighbors met within the dea- con's square room, to discourse the commonalities of the day; when Mr. Mabell remarked to Elisiner that he had been quite happily surprised a few days since, by meeting Mr. Nervourn; adding that he had not seen him before since he had left--to go to A-- ; continuing his remarks with:- "I suppose it is well for Clarence to visit here, the old ancestial mansion of his parents. But, if I remember correctly, he was a mere infant when his father sold this place to you?" turning towards  Deacon Pyrome. "I believe Mr. Mabell, that you're correct, with one exception. Clarence was not born at the time when my brother sold these lands." Elisiner suddenly inquired:-           ! "'What! did Clarence Nervourns parents ever reside in this mansion?"  The uncle took upon himself the responsibility of*  replying.  -  "'The father of out young friend did, indeed,   i reside here, but only for a short -period; his mother I:   lived here with her paints after they settled down upon the old Pyrome Estate." "Your brother's main reason *for selling out to yourself, was, I think, on account of the deep melan- choly which was weighing upon the mind of his beau- tiful daughter Maary?" said Mr. Mabell, interroga- tively. "You are quite right," responded the deacons hesitatingly, at the same time bestowing a glance  towards his listening niece.  Mr. Mabell, turning towards his Wife, said in an undertone: "Wife, I think I have heard you speak of this Mary as being a great pet of yours in the davs of her girlhood?" Mrs. Mabell laid down her knitting work, and turr- ned towards her husband, her countenance sharpened with provoked astonishment, that her spouse, gener- ally so considerate, should, at this time, arouse the exquisitely acute sensibilities of their young friend Elisiner, in this manner. T(e husband instantly caught the stern glance, and he knew very well that there was a depth of meaning there, and the look which he returned, fully assured thfe lady that her husband's feelings were quite in acquiescence with her own, now.  This gentleman, with a tact peculiar to himself, ' turned the current of conversation into a different channel.  "What! another mystery?" thought Elisiner, as  her mind was again lost upon the billows of conjec-  ture.                          j After retiring -to her chamber, she implored her cousin to throw some light upon the subject of recent  conversation, which had taken place between her uncle and Mr. Mabell. ", And why did our neighbor so quicklr, and art- O  *  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7571-00000017"/> 34 fully, turn the conversation, after catching a glance from his lady?'  Miss Amelia had been an attentive listener to Elisiner's remarks, though she did not reply immedi- ately;-but paused a few   moments, apparently 2ngaged in placing her combs and cuffs upon the dressing table. Then for the first time after enter- ing the room, she spoke to her cousin Elisiner:- ,' Why, my dear little coz. how curious you are becoming of late!" But not meeting with a trifling response from Elisi- ner, as she had half expected, she assumed a serious air herself. For a short time both were silent. Elisiner was surprised--nay, startled, at the sudden transfor- mation which passed over her cousin's face. What could it mean? It was true that she had asked a question, and had demanded an explanation. But    ! what of all this? Why should her kind friend assume  i- such an air- of mystery? "Cousin Elly," spoke Amelia, "there is a long \story connected with the question which you asked, End if rehearsed, would require more time than we can afford to spate at present. That is we should be transgressing the laws of nature, that require us to r rest during the hours of night."           I Elisiner could not comprehend why a few natural   - questions should have such a weight attached to them.            :             i ( "I ask for no particulars to-night, cousin Amelia, for I fear by your manner, that you are indisposed. " "Thanks, dear coz. for your solicitude in my    X behalf; but I will simplify my meaning. When I said that the explanation of your questions deman- ded a long narrative as a reply, I was quite right; but the evening is too far advanced', Elly, for me to ' I impart to you the particulars that have merely been  -X alluded to this evening."    85  But Elisiner's mind was still ill at ease, and the old chest haunted her dreams like a lurking spectre!  A strange whirl of mystery confused her brain, whilst a train of unconcentrated ideas threaded their stormy march throughout her pure young soul. She was aroused by her cousin's voice:- "Why, my dear coz. why do you look so dejected? I fear you are forgetting the pleasant tete-tete which we have been so long anticipating?" But meeting with no response from her friend, she adopted another method of arousing her from the intense reverie into which she had fallen ; saying:-- "Elly, this much will I tell you. There were two young gentlemen, both of whom aspired to the hand of my cousin, Mary Pyrone; both loved her, and according to the manners of those days, the thoughts of each were concentrated into the one plan of bear- ing down the opponent, and securing the dear prize. A smile accompanied these words of Miss Amelia's;  but it was an assumed smile. Elisiner looked up; a - shade of reproach settled.  I over her features, as she exclaimed :- - "' Amelia, I am in no mood to be trifled with, this evening."                       , : Miss Amelia, gently laying her hand on the girl's shoulder, said :-  "Elly, ever since our acquaintance commenced, our views and feelings have been so united, that at    i last each stream of congeniality has flowed on through the green and shadowy  depths 'of our souls, until,  . forming into one little lakelet, its banks have been   -i fringed with the pure buds and flowerets offriendship.  i ]But to night, these placid waters are disturbed. - But ? my dear Elly, I Should have thought that your proper   I sense of discrimination would, ere this, have detected ! in your friend Amelia, a something which tould have    a , .'  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7571-00000018"/> 36 repressed that cruel remark which has just fallen from your lips." A tear trembled on the downcast lids of the gentle offender; but the sweet dews of reconciliation sied  j its pureness in the path of these friends, and they were happy again. is Elisiner,'" said Miss Amelia, "I know where your heart reposes. I am aware of the affection which has long existed between Clarence Nervourn and your- self; he, the noble son of my dearly beloved, but departed friend and cousin, Mary Pyrone, The father of Clarence, with Spanish blood coursing through his veins, was very self-willed and impetuous; but with all his faults, he possessed many redeeming qualities. He loved his young wife, with a passion almost amounting to idolatry; he had ever been an earnest devotee at the shrine of her child-like, innocenlt. beauty; but I have often been led to believe that it I was not her sterling worth or gentle nature, as much as her rare beauty, that. so attracted his fancy, and won his love. Good Norah, has told me, that in her presence, after his young wife's death, Mr. Nervourn was heard to remark to a friend with whom he was conversing, that the greatest aim of his ambi-  tion was to arrive half way to the standard of his  :A wife's goodness. But the height of her amiability  ! and unfeigned piety, was beyond his grasp."     ,! "Dear Amelia, please tell me something concerning  the other suitor of this amiable lady."  "( He was a noble souled youth, Elly; goodness and i purity beamed from his open countenance. His was    ^ a life of truth. My cousin Mary was this young man's betrothed bride; but this tall Spaniard crossed his  : path, and, as I -have already observed, was smitten    ] with her uncommon beauty; determined, at the same  time to secure' her heart and hand. He held an-    :  t   37  -              I interview with her father, confessing his passionate love for this lovely girl. ' His manner did not please the good old gentleman, who informed him that his suit was of no avail, as his daughter's hand had already been claimed'; adding that he was sorry that his guest's affections were thus bestowed upon a per- son who could offer nothing in return, except friend- ship. Some time flew past, and still nothing further was heard from the Spaniard, on this subject, Mean- time the same routine of amusements was kept up, and things went on as usual; not long, however, for a storm was gathering over the household." "Oh, how deeply I am- interested in the fate of this gentle lady!" sighed Elisiner. " This East chamber, Elly, is the very same that was appropriated to the use of my Cousin Mary, in those days.}, "This room Amelia ?" "Yes, this very room, Elisiner. This old mansion was, for a number of years, the  plesan  home of Mary Pyrone."1 Here the auditor started, and convulsively clasped her hand, ejaculating:- 6' What! not this very house?" And the mother of Clarence, when a young girl, slept in this chamber !- Do tell me, Amelia--did she ramble about these old grounds as I  do ? "Yes, I presume so, my dear coz; and, I dare say, she rambled over your favourite garret, too." Then Amelia continued-" Elly, do you remember the great ledge by the old beech trees, yonder?" "Oh yes; and now I think of it, why is it that you never seem inclined to tarry near this placee, when,'' you and I are walking ?" and always prefer the old lane, and creeping through -fences, in-stead of taking-- the nearest route to reah this pretty spot  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7571-00000019"/> "Elly, I have my own reasons for this, and per- :  haps, after I have related these reasons, you will not X think me fastidious. I was once here on a visit, when ! Mary proposed walking down to the beech clump.   'jj The day previous we had been taking a horse-back   g ride, so Mary was tired, and sat down under the lar-  gest tree, to rest, by the side of the water. I skippedg about in high glee for a while, when suddenly I bounded towards my cousin, and said, pointing to the j tree beneath which she was seated:-- "' Now Mary, what will you give me if I will climb this tree?' T                     i it "'I dont know, coz,' she answered, laughingly. "Although you can perform almost any feat, this one, j I think you will scarcely be able to accomplish.' Well, we will see.' "With this, I gave a spring which astonished even myself, and reaching the nearest branches, succeeded in getting half-way into the tree, but was unable to proceed any farther. -Meantime, I dared not attempt a descent. I was fast becoming sobered, as I realized the danger of my position. Meantime, Mary had seated herself beneath another tree, and now begged me not to attempt getting down without assistance. I was now reflecting seriously on the chances of my  reaching terra-firma, once more, in safety; when- : Oh! my blood freezes at the thought! I saw crawling up to the very tree underneath which my cousin was seated, an enormous snake; its head raised towards her, and the twinkling black eyes apparently watching her movements.      r  "' Mary! Mary! come quick-quick!"I loudly screamed.          , ', She mechanically arose, looking toward me, -and  apparently thinking of nothing but the danger of my position. '   "She was fearfully afraid of snakes, large or small, i as I very well knew.            * - "Mary, there's a snake near you! Run!" "(She turned, and immediately saw the monster, advancing cautiously, but surely, towards her. She fainted, and fell to -the ground. I screamed with a power hitherto unknown to myself. at the same time letting myself down from the tree. As soon as my feet touched the ground, I caught up a stick, and hastened to the rescueof my fallen cousin. The rep- tile was coiled about the trunk of the tree. its head protruded within a few inches of my cousin's pros- trate form. I beat it with the stout stick which I had picked up, at the same time using my lungs lustily, with the hope of calling to my assistance, some men whom I had observed at work in an adjoin-  - ing field. But the men did not heed my cries; doubtless they had left the field by this time. Our good friend -Mr. Williams had heard, however, and answered my cries in person. "' Hilloa! Miss Amelia, what's the trouble?" he exclaimed. ," I pointed towards the snake. The reptile was soon disposed of, and the boys at Hood's Corner took its skin off, and after stuffing it, presented it to Mr. Williams. Doubtless, hundreds have seen it. And now, Elly, if you desire it, you can"rgo with me to-morrow, as I intend to call at the house of -the old people, and you perhaps, would like to see this reptile?" "' Thank you, my kind friend and entertainer-; nothing would give me greater pleasure; though I dare say that I shall experience unpleasant sensations whilst viewing the monster."  1             ..' ;d '-'. A,                   4  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7571-00000020"/> CHAPTER II.  We will all in silence listen, to the Thrilling achievements of other days. Perhaps the recital of a few incidents-or rather sketches-from  the lives of some of those brave spirits who figured in other days on the frontier wilds of Michigan, would interest our readers. Old Billy Brown-as he was termed-was a famous hunter of the West; he and his wife were grand- parents to old Mr. and Mrs. Williams. In the route our story is destined to take, this worthy couple may again appear before our readers. Near, if not quite one hundred years ago, Billy Brown and Caleb Hugh started for the uncleared wilds of the far West, and erected a strong log cabin, with the intention of remaining there. Both were remarkably hardy men, fearless of all danger. They employed themselves chiefly by hunting, and setting traps for the huge black bears that infested that region; carrying their furs to a settlement at a dis- taTce of some thirty miles. Ii some of these ram- bles, Brown became acquainted with a wild lass, whom, in time, he loved ;.then followed a speedy, but sincere wooing, and before long his cabin was lighted by the presence of the brave, dauntless Theresa, the  a                 a   " wife of the rioble hunter of Michigan. In due time, this union was blessed with a bright-eyed, light haired boy.  One fair, sunny morning in laughing June, the family arose at an unusually early hour, as the father was intending to start in a North-westerly direction for the purpose of transacting urgent busi- ness, and also to receive payment for some furs. Previous to their starting oh this expedition, Brown informed his wife that Hugh and himself would first visit some trappers who were already in their vicinity, and with whom he had dealings. Thither they started, leaving the wife and mother to prepare breakfast. A little footpath wound through the trees from the cot to a clear spring, from whence the family obtained their usual supply of pure, cold water. The mother, having to go for some of this water, left her infant son wrapped in a deer skin, in a rude cradle, near the opon door of the cabin. The forest rang with the melodious notes of the birds, and the young mother's heart leaped with joy, in accordance with the merry strains. She lingered for a moment to inhale the reviving breeze, when suddenly a shrill scream broke upon her ear; her heart was chilled, for it was the cry of her infant boy. In an instant the water-vessel slipped from her hand, and rolled over the bank into the spring. She then sped rapidly along the path to the cabin, where a chilling sight met her gaze. A huge panther was deliberately trotting away from the open door with the child in its mouth; it was hastening off in the direction of the forest. No time for lingering, but acting. The occasion deman- ded calm decision, and courage. One glance at the monster, and a quick sense of the peril that her child was in, and the mother's bravest energies were called  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7571-00000021"/> 42- forth. With the fleetness of a flash -of lightning, she passed through the open cabin door, and seizing a loaded musket, sped along on the trail of the animal. When she came up within a few yards of him, the panther halted a moment, holding the little child just as a cat does its prey, when wishing to prolong  its life for further tormenting; then commenced  to ascend a high tree, only getting as far as the  place where the limbs branched out. Here he again  halted, resting his frail burden in a snug place  between the branches; then peering precociously  about him as he placed his great paw upon the child  for safe keeping, he seemed to observe, for the first  time the approach of the fearless mother. He glared upon her with all the ferocity of his nature depicted in his burning eyeballs. Mrs. Brown had long since become acquainted with the nature and  habits of this wily animal, and had often been awakened from the peaceful night slumbers by their  approach to her cabin home, in the dark forest. From the fact that the present season afforded abun- dant food for the roamers of the wood, additional strength was given to the mother's mind that the life of her offspring might be saved, by due exertion on her part, and the divine interposition of Provi-  dence should she fail in the attempt. No woman ever held a musket in her hands, who could send forth its fiery mission with more accuracy j than the courageous wife of Bill Brown, the Michi' gan hunter. Now with breathless anxiety the mus- ket is raised. What a moment for the mother! Now the piece is discharged; the monster has fallen; he rises with difficulty, growls, and shows his white fangs. But another ball pierces through the animal's skull, and terminates his existance; one part of the head, and the eye, is terribly mangled. The reload,  {I   48 ing of the gun had been performed whilst the smoke was clearing. The panther fell some distance from the foot of the tree, on the farther side. He boun- ded up and down several times; seemed fired with madness; then rolled over and over, in the direction of the woman. Now followed a deep silence; then a full, heavy charge terminated the existance of the animal. Now the child! As soon as the paw of the panther was removed from the child's breast, it fell, slowly descending through the thick branches of the tree, until caught by its clothes to one of the lower limbs, where it now huing, suspended in the air. In this manner its fall to the ground was prevented; but its present position was quite as dangerous, as the child's head was hanging downwards. But, reader, he did not, remain long in this position; you may rest assured that the mother did not stand idly by, whilst her darling was in danger. So the little fellow was rescued, and has lived to rehearse this incident of the true affection and undaunted bravery of his mother. The sickly, puny race of the present generation know little of the courageous hearts that beat in the dim vista of bygone\ days; hearts that beat in the honest breasts of brave, tried men and women. One or two incidents, reader, and we will return to our main history. In one of Hugh's excursions-in trying to secure a bear alive, which he had just caught in a trap, he got wounded; not very badly however. He attempted to carry the animal to his cabin, intending to tame it, hopeing, thereby, to obtain a prize for it at a cer- tain trading-post. Brown was absent at this time, Hugh, thinking that he was progressing finely with his shaggy pupil, ventured to escort him out to a shed, where Mrs. Brown and her boy (now five years  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7571-00000022"/> " of age) were sitting. Ere long they were startled by a sudden shriek, then a smothered groan. Hugh and the bear were rolling together on the floor, the teeth of the latter firmly set in the coat sleeve of his antagonist. Hugh was vainly endeavoring to get possession of a knife which he carried in his pocket; and, notwithstanding his wound, he fought manfully and well with his shaggy foe. "Now keep quiet, Hugh!" said the intrepid Mrs. Brown, ("Rest on your side. Now don't stir!" Bruin was in a close embrace with Hugh; but this was soon cut short. Bang! went the unerring rifle. Bruin fell dead. 1    .      'T When Brown's son was about twelve years of age the cabin was enlarged, whilst many- conveniences were added within and without the dwelling. The lad quite frequently went on hunting excursions with his father. From one of these the youngster returned, very much indisposed, as the day had been sultry. The mother attened the boy to his room, and administered the usual restoratives; then offer. ing up a short but fervent brayer for his well being, bade him good-night, and retired. Now she had quite forgotten to close the wooden slide window, the inlet being some distance from the floor. Mr. Brown X and Hugh had not yet returned. It was very late when they arrived, the father thought that he would not disturb the boy, as he seemed soundly sleeping. So they-put away the game, and Hugh, taking their two guns, powder and' flask, and other hunting accou- trements, went into the apartment of the sleeping lad, to deposit these things in their usual place. He went without a light as he usuall-y did; walking very   45 cautiously, lest he should disturb the boy. When about half way across the room, his orbs, as it were, became suddenly transfixed, on the two glaring eye- balls near where he stood. At first he thought that it might be an optical illusion. But no! rais- ing his loaded piece, and taking accurate aim, directly between the glaring eyeballs, the deep silence was broken by the crack of the rifle. In less than an instant the teeth of the enraged cat-for such it proved to be--were perforating the tough side of his boot-legs. In the meantime the determined trap- per applied his gun lustily upon the brute. This unusual commotion brought Mr. Brown and his wife into the room; the former bearing a lighted torch. The wild cat was soon dispatched. Huron- shaw, the boy, was sitting up in bed by this time. His first utterance after perceiving the dead foe was: - "Well, Mister Wildcat, instead of getting a poor young lad for your supper, your catship has been treated to a taste of cold lead." Old Billy Brown and Hugh have long since fin- ished their: hunting and trapping; they lie quietly sleeping 'neath the dark, dashing waters. Brown's representative lived many years. DIYoubtless if his numerous achievements were recorded they would have been hailed with more interest than many other well filled pages of history. But he, like thousands G  of those brave spirits, was unnoticed and forgotten save in the hearts of those who once knew, loved, and i  appreciated them. i Never would the writer have been able to pen what she has, had it not -been that she was often a listener, in her younger days, to these tales, as related by the daughter of the brave Huronshaw Biown. Some years after the intrepid old trapper and his  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7571-00000023"/> " heroic helpmeet were lain away to sleep" 'neath the dark pines of the forest " near the lonely cabin,-did young Huronshaw leave his native woods, to travel Northward, until he became acquainted with the blithe, rural lassie who, in due time, became his life companion. As years rolled on, their hearthstone be- came encircled by numerous sturdy little scions, in the shape of curly-haired, roguish boys. One daughter, only, bloomed in this-domestic garden; and a tiny precious creature she was, nestling lovingly in the arms of her fond parents as they roved amid their native green- hills. But as gaunt Death is ever upon the alert, so did he throw the heavy, damp dust of sorrow over the pathway of this worthy family, scat- tering the young buds of promise, one by one, until Theresa, alone, was left to her parents. Five boys slept side by side in the shade of the green hills. The young Theresa lived; and living, scattered the leaves of peace and joy over and around the hearts of her parents, until they, like the multitudinous number of the human family were ushered away from the earth; their forms sleeping the long sleep of death. Ere long the young faithful maid found a well-tried friend in Mr. Leonard Williams, who became her natural   I protector. They are now aged people, blessed with  f kind children, and happy, gleeful grand-children.   Little -Hattie Williams we shall have occasion to mention frequently in the route -our history is destined to take. Doubtless our readers are disposed to feel quite a respect for the worthy -old gentleman, who proved him self so efficient in destroying the venomous reptile near the pretty lakelet, where the two cousins had repaired to while away a few hours of recreation. And we would add moreover, that the only apology which we shall offer to our friends for escorting them f   47 to the wilds of Michigan,-through the dark for- ests, across the dark, boiling floods, then up steep ascents, on through valleys, to the cabin of the brave hunter Billy Brown-is to give them   a trifling insight into, and around the precincts of the home of the grandparents of the now aged Mrs. Williams, the quiet, cheerful grandmother of our laughing little Hattie, the favorite of Willie Fosdick, and the petted playmate of our heroine Elisiner Hovert. We will now retrace our wandering steps. We will reverse the scene, and gather up the maip thread of our narrative lest it becomes entangled in wayside shrubbery, or borne away by some truant mountain breeze. We left old Mr. Williams busily engaged in des- patching the intruder in close proximity to the tree where Mary Pyrone had been sitting. After despatch- ing the snake, the ,attention of the old gentleman, and Miss Amelia, was attracted towards the fallen girl. Mary had swooned entirely away, her white face press- ed upon the green sward. Amelia hastened to the little basin of clear water, and dashed it on the face of her cousin; and they soon had the satisfaction of observing signs of returning consciousness. Cousin Mary was removed home by Mr. Williams and Miss Amelia. "Doubtless the fright of Cousin Mary," continued Miss. Amelia, to Elisiner, " was of a more serious char- acter, owing to a very recent fatigue, the day before, from riding horseback. This recreation was very much admired by the younger portion of our friends." "'Did anything of a serious character happen to your amiable cousin?" "Yes, Elly, she was retained in doors, an invalid, for some days; nay I might say weeks." "Now,-dear cousin, that I think of it, would it not i  .             p;   &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7571-00000024"/> 48 he delightful if I could complete my lessons in horsemanship?" "You are already getting along as well as we can reasonably expect, dear Ellyi" "But still, I should object to riding after the sun has bidden farewell to the land, and deep shadows are lengthening over the hills, as you often do, Cousin Amelia." "My dear Elly, nothing is so soul-stirring; 'it is a suitable time for the soul to soar heavenwards, when evening is fast closing in upon us, and the soft charms of twilight absorbs our soul in holy contemplation. Pleasing and grateful objects present themselves to feed the mind, in the chaste rays of the moon. The tiny streamlets, often rippling near my feet, pass quietly along, making sweet music in their course. The barking of the watchful house-dog, mingling with the noisy glee of happy children; all these sights and sounds greet the eye and ear of the rider, Whilst the sober vest of eve spreads around and ad- monishes even the pleasure-seeking moonlight ram- blers to bend their steps homeward. Oft-times have I enjoyed just such soul-stirring scenes as these, when riding homewards, when I have paused involuntarily to listen to the whispering winds sweeping through the shadowy pine forests. How sweet and sacred to the meditative mind! filling the soul with sublime emotions. Night's pensive hours glide sweetly and silently on! But Elisiner, you must pardon this digression from my story. After relating to you what I have, about this sad encounter of my cousin's, do you consider it as anything very singular?" "No, Amelia, I have ceased to wonder. But my thoughts are upon your horseback rides by evening. I consider myself courageous, but I think that my- nerves would shrink from pausing to listen to the "     g 1       49 wailings of the wind among the forest trees, unaC- companied by any one. I think that it would height. en my enjoyment, in such a case to have a participa- ter in an evening moonlight excursion." "Certainly, Elly; for instance, one similar to Mr. Clarence, in appearance." Elisiner blushed deeply, but did not deny the fact. "I suppose, Amelia, that the death of your amiable cousin has added to your wish of avoiding this lovely spot?" "Yes, this has heightened my distaste of the spot?" "But, notwithstanding this antipathy of yours,it is certainly a most lovely spot. Nature has lavished a profusion of charms around this sequestered place, I remember thinking last Summer, when in company with Clarence and my little sisters, as we were stroll- ing down the old lane, pausing near the banks of this lake, that it would be a fine resort for geese. There were some singular flowers, also, which we gathered, and Clarence explained them. Sister Lunette declared that she had enjoyed quite a peep into the science of Botany. But the trees, Amelia; perhaps we sat directly underneath the identical tree where his snakes ship had located himself." "Oh no, Elly, not so; for that tree, .as well as some others, was cut down, stripped of its branches, and is now used as a post for tying horses. It stands at the end of the flat wall in the West yard." "What, Amelia, you do not mean that this is the post where Clarence fastens his horse whenever he comes here, do you?" "Yes,Elly, the very same." "But I should think that the posts driven into the ground thus, must have decayed long ere this." "Indeed, they would, but that the ends were faiths fully charred before setting them in the ground. But E-   5      -   &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7571-00000025"/> 50 there goes the old clock; 'tis midnight.' Elly, there is a long history connected with this old clock, which for many a long year, has stood like a faithful senti- nel behind the dining-room door." What is this history?' eagerly enquired Elly. "My father,' perhaps, may see fit to gratify your curiosity, Elly. But now good night Elly dear." "But--Oh, Amelia! do tell me more about your Cousin Mary, where you left off. You said that she used frequently to ramble over these old grounds, and in my favorite garret." "So she did, Elly." "Well, I should love to remain for hous together in this place, if it were not----."  "Oh, Elly, you surprise me. What do you mean? Would you forego. this enjoyment, because the beauti- ful pious mother of your friend used to sit at your favorite window, in former days?" "No, no; I can see her in my mind's eye now, it iould seem, I wish I were as good as she. But did she sing, Amelia?" "Yes indeed; and perused many of "those old vol- umes just as you do, Elisiner. Old Mr. Williams used to say that Cousin Mary was almost a celestial being." I have pictured her to myself as a lovely being, nearer allied to purer beings than those of earth," re- marked Elly. "She did not think thus of herself; on the contrary sheio6ftai sighed over her supposed wickedness of heart. Though in mye yes,she was almost an angel." But tell me something more of the Spanish gen- tleman, and his rival, Amelia." My inquisitive little cousin,we will drop this con- versation for the present, if you please, to renew it at some future day. Now Elisiner, we will take leave of all fancied and real evils, and resign ourselves to l. -    10 t51 the arms of Morpheus; offer up a silent prayer to heaven,ifor its continued protection over us, and all the inhabitants of this vast universe." E!  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7571-00000026"/> CHAPTER III. A month later, in the little retired chamber of which we were last speaking. In a -corner stood a small, round table, upon which rested the rounded arm of our friend Elisiner Hovert. Her head was bowed, her eyes fixed on vacuum. The stars of heaven seemed to glance pityingly .on the motionless maiden whilst the moon, partly hidden behind the clouds, emitted a pale light into the room. The dull chirp of the crickets seemed sadder on this evening, because of their misgivings that ere long cold winds would come, and drive mirth from the whole fraternity of crickets. The distant hootings of the owls in the for- est, had no power to disturb the reverie ottfr maiden. Only the hoarse bark, and an occasional growl from Tiger, as he kept his night watch upon the broad, flat wall, near the West porch, arrested her attention for a moment. A distant bell tolls the hour of night, which is eleven o'clock.                . "' Yes, yes," murmered our sad Elisiner. "Yes, yes, my little favorite, my angel Dora, has left me forever. Only a few short hours since I followed her little form to the silent grave. There she sweetly rests! Oh, -how I loved this child. No more will her little arms   53 encircle my neck, or her sweet velvet cheek rest new my heart. Her brigh t blue eyes will ne'er weep again in sympathy, when she sees mine cast down sorrow. But it is all right; a bright jewel will she be in, our Father's crown!  Here the young mourner reached out her hand, 1 nd took from the table a somewhat faded bouquet Q I flowers, that had been placed in a glass of water early in the morning, before little Dora's death; they ha been gathered by Elisiner, at Dora's request, from the flower-pots and vases in the bay-window. The dy ing child had missed the fair hand that presented them. Elisiner gazed upon them for a few moments, through her tears, then replaced them-from whence' she had taken them. Then resting her bead upoon  the arm of her chair, she remained silent, apparently dreaming. On the table, not far from 'the boquet of faed flowers, lies two half-opened letters. What can the ontents be? Would it be an intrusion to step between and tak4e them-? We will for once o'erstep the boum! a of "meddle not," and peruse those lines which may prove as interesting to- the reader as to Qurselves. The moon has ust emerged from blhind the ligr, fleecy clouds, where, for the last half hour she has appeared to be playing ("hie and go seek'" wlith- e. world below. - The first letter' which we take up, seems to ha epme from Mr.1 Olarnce Hevourn, the accepted lovy, of our sleping friend. It is :written in the nmolj refined and intellectual terms, utterly 4levod pf thhsa idt1p thetse whkiih so many lovers see- fit to crowd iasRo the missives to -Ithir lady loves.

Though not as stead- ily as I might wish, my health will not admit of that close application to study, which I so much desire. Here, doubtless, starts a tear, my Elly, when you read the above clause. But dry it soon, for I have been out with my invalid friend Adolphus Mansfield to-day, on a fishing trip; a short one but nevertheless a pleasant one. We enjoyed a lovely sail; stopped at N---, where the giant from the East was on exhibition, and a a number of the most formidable looking tigers that I ever saw. There were also the celebrated singers from P---; but excuse me, my own dear Elly, if I say that I have heard notes that seemed far sweeter to my ear than those of the above mentioned vocalists." Oct. 30th.: Good evening my little nun! I feel somewhat Bad this evening, in consequence of participating in the suffering of the early friend of my childhood, Adolphus Mansfield. You, doubtless, will remember his excellent mother. We met her last summer at the Falls, You often observed to me that she bore a striking resemblance to your own sainted mother. She is now dead! My poor friend is almost heart-broken at the loss. He loved his mother with his whole heart and soul. Perhaps I am a little wrong in this state; ment, for I think that he loved his Maker better. He feels that his Heavenly Father has taken his mother home. Adolphus will pursue his studies for as long a time as his health will permit. Now, my precious Elly, don't think whilst looking at my friend's picture through a glass, that you are reading mine behind it!" -' . '-   '         %ov., 38rd. "Adolphus took the 'steamer early this morning,   55 I for his distant home. Perhaps we shall never nteet again. His father died about a year since, leaving him a handsome property. Now, dear one, I have been picturing you to myself, as sitting in your favorite retreat, the little old   East-garret; reading, or singing, or perhaps gazing out upon the stars. Is it thus, dear one? If so how gladly would I seat myself beside thee, and allow the notes of my long neglected flute to accompany your thoughts! The old East garret possesses charms for me, also; not only because my earthly idol has chosen it for her sanctum, but there is a secret charm within its precincts. After I left you, Elisiner, at the house of your uncle, I stopped for a few days at my father's. On the second evening of my visit, we were conversing with a friend who had called in to spend a short time with us, and who, by the way, spoke of the beautiful walks surrounding the Pyrone estate. My father, in an authorative voice, demanded the subject of our conversation. I informed him, when he added: (I presume that you have not ranged over the house, fields, and woods?' This he said interrogatively. H replied that I had, and expiated somewhat largely upon the mysteries of the old garret, when he inter- rupted me with the thundering exclamation: ,. Boy! dare not enter those precincts again, else you will incur my everlasting displeasure!"After a short pause, he demanded a promise from  me that I would comply with his command; at the same time adding that he had-reasons of his own for wishing me to accede to his wish that I should never visit the Pyrone man- sion again.  Do not allow this bit of intelligence to give your sensitive heart one moment's pain, my dear Elly, for I carefully evaded giving the promise '-vaded giving the promise  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7571-00000028"/> 56 demanded of me; though not that I approve of A child's disobedience towards his parents, where the request is at all reasonable. My father asserted that he was right in his demands, but did not qualify his assertion, therefore I do not consider myself under any- obligations to deprive you or myself of the -many pleasant rambles which we have anticipated round and about- the old domains. I shall visit you again during the nAext vacation, which comes in about ten weeks from the present time." This letter wound up with a few brief lines, which it, is not our purpose, nor do we feel at liberty, to set before the curious eyes of our readers. Every true- hearted lover will, at least, echo the loving words thus penned. The first letter is finished, and yet the gentle breathing of the sleeper is distinctly heard. Gentle child, sleep -n! The missive is replaced, and with a cautious step we retrace our steps back to the remote window, bwhere the moon is seen sailing adowu the sky. Now we. will glance over the opening lines of the second letter. I;t reads thus:-- -Oct. 24th, .- .: "BE LOVED ABSENT CHtD ELLY. Oh! how thy mother's heart yearns to clasp thee.; to her maternal breast! My poor prayers areoffered up daily, for your eternal and temporal welfare.

N ow, dear reader, is it any wonder that the fair and interesting Elisiner Hovert was sorrowful after the perusal and re-perusal of two such letters as these which we have just finished reading? No wonder that her young head was bowed down in sadness. A few years previous to the opening of our story, Mr. Hovert was one of the proudest-- -but stop! did I say proud? Nay, not superciliously proud; although his bearing seemed marked with a native tinge of high-toned dignity, he was a noble-hearted, intellectual gentleman, very well skilled in his ar- duous profession. Col. Hovert was a man who had officiated in the capacity of representative; had been for a series of years a busy actor on the public plat- form. Thus was our young friend situated; apparently beggar, as she was at this time subsisting on the bounty of her aunt, Mrs. Pyrone, her mother's eldest sister, and the second wife of Deacon l'yrone; her mother in ill health, suffering from consumption; her sisters young and helpless; ploughing her way on through life, with occasional assistance from her' friends, seldom enjoying the kind instructions of her excellent parent. She had but just returned from the grave of her dear little cousin, the solace of many a wearisome hour. And now her mind was filled with dark fore- bodings, for the future welfare of her adored lover, "treading the wine press alone ;" a stern parent's frown resting upon his devoted head-! And then the shadowy mysteries connected with the secluded garret which she had chosen for a /'   :/ place of rest and meditation ; the strange appear- ance and momentary agitation of Clarence when last in this retreat- with her; and, moreover, the fathers's astonishment and anger, when he became aware of his son's visiting this place. Is it a wonder, then, that the heart of our young friend was sorrowful on this night? Listen! there is a slow movement near the table; the lady has arisen. There is a low whisper, as soft as an angel's breath; it is heard in yonder corner of the room. Now by the pale, flickering rays of the in moon, we perceive the kneeling form of the mourner, her bowed head resting upon the ottoman. She prays that God will forgive her father,s enemies, and bless her dear absent friends; that He will purify her heart, and grant her patience to give herself, all in all, to our dear Redeemer. How still, and quiet! she scarcely moves, and- n ot even a lisp is heard in the chamber. The pale rays of the moon rests upon her marble-like features, as she moves noiselessly towards an opposite window, giv- ing one glance at the stars in the blue vault of heaven. "Now I will go to the room of my poor sick friend," she said to herself. But before her sentence was finished, she heard a low tap on the chamber- door; then it was opened, and Miss Caroline Rawson entered, enquiring of Elisiner if she were ready to take her place in Miss Amelia's room. This lady held the secret of the mysterious gar- ret; but Elisiner had desisted from questioning her concerning it, as it was very plain that the subject distressed Miss Amelia. Her curiosity had been greatly increased by a circumstance which had oc. curred about a week previous: Miss Amelia went up into the old garret to find some patterns, as she said ;  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7571-00000030"/> 60 and after an absence of about an hour, a scream is- sued from the upper loft, and on the arrival of assist tance, the poor lady was found lying upon the floor in a swoon. After she was restored to consciousness, she made no allusion to this affair; when questioned, she gave evasive answers. She said' that "it was merely un- comfortable staying there so long; and turning to Elisiner, said, with a fond smile--- "You must air your sanctum, dear, so that visitors there may not alarm the family by fainting fits." But the dust that was thus thrown before Elly's eyes was so thin and light that it did not obscure her mental vision; so she determined to fathom the whole mystery at some future time. But since re- ceiving Clarence's last letter, she had resolved to let the whole affair rest until that friend should make another visit to the mansion. In our next chapter we will introduce our readers into the sick-chamber of the invalid, Miss Amelia. "  "-   X.! *CHA PTER IV. One pale thinly-draped star of evening Keeps vigils in the loiuded heavea, Like a lone wanderer of the night Waiting 'till the dawn of light! In a large, ancient chamber in the Southern ex- tremity of the house, we again find our young riend Eisiner. She is carefully bending over her. sick friend, listening attentively to the half-connect- ed sentences falling from the pale lips of the invalid. "Oh! why did----why did he--  leave, --those relics of past days! Poor Mary!    she suffered, too!" Then the tone became lower and lower, and the words more inaudible, until Elisiner could hear noth- ing more. Then she made a few    necessary arrangements about the apartment, before resting; then, inthe lone still hours of night, she watched by the siek- couch of her friend, who had fallen into a light doze. At such an hour as this, it is a fit time for the mind to take a peep into the store house of tieas. ured remembrances; to- traverse he dusty halls of the- heart  This was the case of Elisiner at this 6  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7571-00000031"/> 62 hour.  Perhaps the reading of her mother's letter formed a subject for her present retrospection. She silently sighed-- "No home-no fortune; but God's mercies are multitudinous.  I have a mother and sisters; and kind friends have provided for me a     temporary home. Then I have God's beautiful. world to gaze upon, and study.  What a glorious study is Nature's great book!  But oh, my childhood's home!" she slowly ejaculated.  "That home taken away from us, and through the basest treachery too.  My poor mother's gentle heart is clothed in sorrow; yet she mourns not for herself, but for her innocent chil- dren!" Whilst our young friend meditated thus, the fol- lowing lines suggested themselves to her mind:- Childhood's hills are dear to me, Beneath the green bough'd canopy; Our home was near an ancient mill Where the Hudson danced beyond the hill, Along whose banks my early songs I carrolled, Listening to the dashing of the waters bold. - Ah me! the hills are levelled-faded is the green! Large commerce is wedged in between The rural groves and woodlands dark, Where the wood-nymphs used to waltz; Now all is faded! for lofty steeples Now are towering to the sky. Rows of edifices, of every size and hue Are standing now where my wild flowers grew, There is yet one place!-a sacred dell- But there my sad heart forbids to dwell! A low voice breaks the stillness of the room: "Elly, have you come?" "Yes," answered her attendant, "I have come, dear cousin. How do you feel after your sleep" "Some refreshed, my dear."  In the course of the night Elisinr had occasion   X    . 168 to open a closet-door which communicated with this room; here she was startled by beholding a small pair of blue and white pants, also a vest and jacket to match. Well knowing that the contents of this closet belonged exclusively to Miss Amelia, (and this person a maiden lady,) who evinced the greatest aversion to having any one,-especially boys--intrude the privacy of her apartment, she could not conceal her surprise, as she gazed upon the apparel. How- ever, after securing that of which she was in search, she closed the door; but the sleeve of thejacket had become caught in the door in some way, which was ! entirely unobserved for the present. Dawn appeared at last; streaks of light streamed up in the Eastern sky, showing that the sun was arising. The invalid lady seemed greatly refreshed, and even cheerful, at times. Meantime, the keen eyes of the young cousin were watching her appearance with deep interest. With her penetrating nature, she knew very well that there was: some mystery con- nected with this recent indisposition of her cousin's. i  One afternoon, when the first light snow had fall- en, Elisiner and her joyous schoolmate, Kitty Lenson, were making there way homeward through   the orchard; whilst the air rang with their merry laugh- ter. "What's in the wind now?" shouted Philip, the eoloured-man-of-all-work, walking to meet them, with his colt whip in his brawny hand. "Oh, know we! and a good joke it is, too; isn't it Willie?"' The child looked up and said: "How do you suppose I know? 1 don't attend Madame Clay's Seminary, and don't want to, either. A cross old puss she is!  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7571-00000032"/> " "What! Willie, you can't mean the amiable Mrs. Clay?" 4No, no," interposed the light-heated Kitty; "it - is Miss Peterson that you mean. Will, is it not 9? By this time the little party had reached the house. Kate had continued laughing, until she was suddenly cut short by a glimpse of a frown on Elisi- ner's face. Evening came; and the girls, thinking the joke too good to -keep, went into the back parlor, where the whole family, with the exception of the grave Mrs. PyronQe was assembled. Miss Clay being absent, it fell to her assistant, Miss Peterson, to supply her place. Now this, lady usually assumed this responsi- bility with a downright good will. She threatened through her nose, well filled with snuff; and even wlnt so far as to slap Mrs. Ellinett's girls in the face, with a slate; also tearing a writing book from the hands of Johnnie Fisk, separating the cover from the book, and throwing it into his face; when he was usually one of the best lads in school. And she had just told Sarah Cross that she should be expelled from school, when suddenly, a monkey jumped into the room through the open window, with a hat upon his head, with blue ribbons flying from it. He capered about the room, from desk to desk, and never halted until he reached the teacher's seat, where e seized Miss Peterson's bonnet, and setting it, jauntily upon his cranium, proceeded to strut about the aisles. Miss Peterson threw books at him, and tried to secure her bonnet, which only irritated his monkey-ship; and in a few seconds he had torn it in fragments, and thrown the remains into the chimney-corner. Finally he concluded to leave the premises; and in his somewhat hasty exit, upset the inkstand, which had been left very carelessly upon   65 X    athe desk; and the black liquid streamed all over Miss Peterson's gloves and atlas. But this was not all. Here the half suppressed laughter that was going on throughout the group was hushed by Miss Ame- lia's voice, telling the young girls that it was unkind in them to laugh at their teacher's misfortunes, even if she were cross once in a while. A!  But the rest of the story was soon told. The monkey had also seized Miss Peterson's red shawl, draging it with him through the open windows; down the road, through the light snow and soft mud; for the snow had melted sufficiently to make the road very wet and sploshy. The boys chased the mischievous animal, whilst the girls tittered, and watched the race. When the shawl was- recovered, its appearance was more like an old mop than othe  W ise. :' Oh, my shawl, and bonnet!" ejaculated the dis- tressed teacher. "It is too bad-too bad!" "And it was decidedly too bad," said Miss Amelia. "How any of us should have felt had such a misfor- tune happened to us. Why, the monkey might have cut the same shines with your bonnet, or shawl; or the ink-stand might have spoiled your property. You, doubtless, would have 'had the sympathy of all your fellow pupils. I think it would have been best, had the young students treated their teacher with more respect." A light fleecy snow continued falling during the night, rendering the walking very disagreeable on the ensuing morning. So,as the wind was cold and raw it was decided that the girls should remain at home. Although Elisiner regretted the loss of her reitations, yet a careful consideration of the subject tended to reconcile her to the arrangement, as they g  v ,e  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7571-00000033"/> ^ 6 had promised themselves much pleasure during: the, day, in rummaging over the old furniture and books- in the garret. All,is confusion in the dining-room. Little Sally i .setting, the, dinner table, superintended by stately, Mrs, Pyrone. "Here, Sally, take thiabell and ring it like Jehu at the foot of the garret stairs!" commanded the cook,. "Who is ringing the dinner bell so loudly?" said Mrs. Pyrone. Sally made her appearance, still. holding the noisy. bell. "Who are you trying to raise with. your clamerous. ringing?" dernaned. Mrs. Pyrone of herlittle waiting. maid. "Why, the young ladies are up garret, mistresi." The summons had theAdesired effect,..the girls inmde their appearance at dinner; but as soon as their corn- pny could be dispensed with,.they immediately started for the garret again.. Reader, if you wish, we will; follow them, They are seated upon an old sofa.. Whether this ancient piece: of furniture retained its originalcolor,..or whether time had changed, it to its present.. hue, we do loot know. .The girls were busily engaged in perusing a.- musty looking manuscript. Both were looking over- tl., same paper. Now a. sigh, then a. pitying. tear fell. upon the. manuscript ; which, as .we have learned, was written by an intelligent Afriean woman. If we. cQutd spare the time. wewouldgive to the world a .book equalling, if not exceeding; the interest of the far- famed "Uncle Tom's Cabin." For instance.,. three handsome black children were. set. up as marks,to. be shot at, like, so many turkeys... The last one, an interestinggirl of fifteen, fell wound- ea; suppled to. b what her cruel master termed" a   ; dead nigger." But the master's more humane son upon looking at the girl, observes signs of returning. consciousness. So her wounds were dressedi and sooner. than she was able, sent out into the fields to work. Soon another planter visited the owner- of this girl, and seeing her, extolled on her unusual beauty; but the; master had detirmined to appropriate her beauty to the satisfaction of his own diabolical purposes. S  ortunately, however, his plans were frustrated by the intelligence of the. girl's mother, who lilke Uncle. i Tom," had been brought up in a well-disposed family  though, indeed, these people were slave-holders. For. this: interference the poor black mother was cruelly whipped, over and over again; and: for two wholeF days she was kept in solitary confinement, her only companions. a- swarm of blue flies., Oh, horrible ina- deed.!. Bu t-we: must -desist from giving .a full. detail, of: these events written .down in the. oldl time worn man- uscript. We will only say that in after years, -it was, ascertained-tha4: these. pages. were penned by, a learn- ed black woman, whose daughter was supposed to have been saved by the master's son. The woman. was one of a few who escaped at: the time that there was-an insurrection among. the blacks., in-----Co. This individual did not participate in the riot; but was assisted by many older and stronger personal to make her escape into Canada.. Afterwards. she went - to New York, where she learned the tailoress trade, giving-proofs of so much ability and goodness of heart,  thather employers sent her to a good- school, where she gained a permanent education. We gained pos- session of facts, .aftef reading the manuscript, and. satisfied-ourselves thait old Aunt Hfitty, who once lived with. Squire Wilder, was the identical person and the writer of said manuscript,  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7571-00000034"/> 68 One hour later, and the manuscript is folded, and replaced underneath the old sofa cushion. The first to speak after depositing this book in its place, was Kitty, who said-- "- Let us finish this interesting story to-morrow Elly dear; as you know our school does not keep." "And you," responded Elisiner, "will remain with ' me."  "Yes, I think I will. I can send word to mama by  brother Byron, who returns to town this evening; and who, by the way, will call to see where his mad- cap sister is. I want to spend Saturday with you." "Yes, Kate, but-what is this?" at the same time lifting a large bundle from the sofa box. "I dont know. Let's open it, and find out. I say, Why, here is a long, rusty' bombazine dress, with ragged sleeves; and here is something which appears like matted wooly hair here, rolled in this piece of brown paper.  Here, also is a small pair of rusty shoes." This matted wooly hair proved to be a relic of the cruelty of the black woman's master towards her young brother, who was recaptured with herself in their first efforts to escape into Canada. This hair, and the old tattered dress had been kept as sad me-  mentos of past, sorrowful days. Many years before, this woman had visited this mansion, and had proba- bly depositedthe things in this place, where they had remained ever since. O   O    O   O       0 Every person knows, doubtless, that ancient tow- ers, old gables, and garrets, whose roofs have nobly braved the elements for centuries, cannot be styled very "green in life." Suffice it to say that the ven- erable garret in question, had maintained its office  as reservoir for several families ; though, we believe,   69 a chain of' connection ran through every family, and all were staunch Republicans. Several times had these premises been invaded by the British Soldiery. We do not intend to have it understood that young America feels disposed to boast of these invasions of the English gentry. For a long series of years this much spoken of garret bad' been a receiver of all cast off articles and furniture. Many parcels had been placed here, and never found afterwards. Whe- ther forgotten, or considered of trifling consequence, we do not know. But certainly, many articles were suffered to re- main here without molestation, sinking, like most other things, into the gulf of Oblivion. Various kinds of spinning wheels were storred away in one corner, as though intending to commence operations on their own hook. Views of these ancient relics lead the mind far back into the dim long ago, when our good mothers and grandmothers used to sit by the open door, busily engaged in turning the spindle, and ever and anon casting searching glances 'neath the deep shadows of the surrounding forests, half fearing lest they should espy the stealthy Indian., peering at them from behind the sturdy trunk of some ancient oak, with uplifted tomahawk, ready to bury its keen edge in the brains of father and son, or perhaps the whole family. In a neighboring corner stands a large chest, stowed full of books; amongst others is a large, old fashion- ed Bible, covered with faded green baize. These vol- umes, for the most part, were history, treating of nearly every nation on the globe. Elisiner, from a child, had evinced a taste for an- cient history; and therefrom had imbibed an un- quenchable thirst for substantial reading, interwoven with the treasured- lovliness of chaste romance. Her  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7571-00000035"/> 70 nature was too strongly impregnated with romance and poesy. From the perusal of these ancient pages, she had received a large amount of information, much more than a year's toiling study at school could have given her. Nearly by there is still another chest, of equal dimensions, resting one half its weight upon a brok- en stool. Our young friends pause before it. Ah! they have made some startling discovery. See-our sprightly Kitty looks profoundly sober. Something has dropped from her hand to the floor. It is a cork leg. Surprising! Morever, a foot is attached to it. Who could it have belonged to? and how came it in this locality? The girls gazed, sighed, then replaced it in its rest- ing place. Behind the chimney corner we find a pair of snow- shoes, a pair of panels, and a side-saddle, also, which in its day must have been very handsome, as it was one of peculiar workmanship. No doubt but that many a fair damsel has mounted this well formed seat, and rode over the country by the side of their brave lovers; perhaps fording some dark, shallow stream, where on the opposite side they might have been startled by the dismal howl of the prowling, hungry wolf, just emerging from the thick jungle. The maidens of those days were not backward in courage and power. The proud aristocratic damsels of old England, can never boast of nobler or more daring acts than the bright-eyed, open-souled girl of New England. But we must not lose sight of our young ramblers Elisiner and Kitty. They are now in a remote cor- ner making new discoveries. Protruding from an Indian willow basket, was the   X"*I,       7i sleeve of a blue coat, trimmed with strips of a bright red. The brass buttons were somewhat visited by  time. "Can it be a British red-coat?" Crouded downiin the same basket was a pair of stays ;" worn doubtless, by the ladies of "Ye olden times."   Also a pair of kneebuckles; then a pair of spurs. We will pass by immense cluster of chairs, faded tattered ottomans, brass andirons, half-demolished ta- bles, secretaries, trunks and boxes. We should not dare, neither would we wish to intrude upon the East garret, the chosen sanctum of our young friend Elisi- lner. But we will now look after the girls. They were still making new discoveries, although Elisiner had continually passed and repassed the bounderies of this garret, going to and from her own sanctum; although there was an easier way of getting to this retreat, though Elisiner seldom ascended this narrow stair-case. Hark! they are discoursing upon some excitable theme. What can it be?  See-our Kitty stands erect, and her eyes have a wild expression. Her cheek is mantled with some strong, strange emotion. And Elisiner, too; her face is like marble. She is holding in her hand a small box, with something deep- ly stamped upon the lid. Elisiner doubts whether it would be right to penetrate the mnysteries of the box. But the less considerate Kitty is guided by an en- quiring mind and eye, and opens it. There are seven or eight braids of hair, neatly ar- ranged and tied together, and deposited in this small shell box; laid in the shape of a heart. Raising the spring-lock, a little white dove presents itself. This box and its contents is what has caused the  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7571-00000036"/> " sudden revolution of feeling which we have noticed in the young ladies. A short distance from this box lay two miniatures; part of one protruding through a wrapper of blue pa- per. One was the miniature of a youth, with a calm, holy expression of countenance; the other a maiden of about seventeen summers; rather long favored; but whose features were very beautiful; perfectly lady-like, with modesty and intellectuality blended in the expression of the countenance, which bore tes- timony that the possessor was a person of truthful, confiding nature. There were also a few lines of poetry, penned with blue ink ; but so faded, that the reading did not prove explanatory of the original meaning; several curiously-wrought images made of ivory, of which one was a tiny Spanish poinard. These things were duly replaced, and after closing the heavy lid of this old chest, the maidens passed on to a settee, where they seated themselves, and were soon buried in a deep reverie. But their abstracted- ness was of short duration. Besides, Kitty found that she was in rather close proximity to a nest of young mice. Their squeaking bore testimony that their situation was far from agreeable.- The low monotonous sounds, were in unison with their present state of feelings. The heavy drops of the half-melted snow, falling upon the square-roof of the old house, with the frequent sweep of wind, breath- ing heavily among the thick trees of the forest; then the low but steady nibbling of the mice in a remote corner, and the pitter-patter of their scampering feet across the garret floor; and the tick--tick--of the ghastly time-keeper, beating time to 'the undtertime hat was playing at the heart-strings of the young Sadies. \ "If the storm continues, 1 fear that brother Byron will not come here to-night," said Kate.   73 Waiting for a moment, and receiving no response, she continued : "Perhaps, Elly, you do not wish to see company this evening?" "I have no objections to seeing your brother, if it will afford yourself any pleasure, dear Kitty." This was said without the speaker's raising her eyes from the floor, where, for the last half hour, they had been resting. A few moments elapsed be- fore Elly took the hand of her companion, at the same time rising from her seat, saying that it was time for them to go down stairs. They did not descend as they were wont to do us- ually, by the main stair-case; but passed through the little East garret, and from thence down the narrow stairs. Elly stopped for a moment in order to replace a chair, a stool, also some books and papers; meantime Kitty took up some poetry which was lying on the small table, in this apartmentf and after reading it, thus- said to herself:- "And here lies this identical old Bible, that I Saw here two months ago, whilst on a visit. - It was then in that old chest of drawers," at the same time turn- over the leaves. "Here is a place marked; and still another, with Elly's peculiar mark. IKate was reading, when her friend came up, and laying her hand upon her shoulder, said slowly:-- I "When my father and mother forsake me, then the -Lord shall take m. up;" repeating many other pas- sages of divine truth, similar to the above. "My poor father is dead, but my pious mother still lives, and is one of the excellent of the earth. But Oh!" here a tear dropped from her eye upon the Ho- ly Book, from whence she drew a fountain of c )nsola- tion; "circumstances deprived me of living with this 7  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7571-00000037"/> 74 kind mother, but I will try to imitate the example which she sets before her children, in this world." "Hurrah! shouted little Willie at the foot of the stairs. "Are you nuns up there? And you" turn- ing to Kate, " turning nun, too!" Then throwing kisses at each, he bounded down the stairs again, as gaily as he had come up. The girls followed, ready to join him in his inno- cent frolics.  I   CHAPTER V: ,.r , "Whene'er this life to-thee should seem A grievous, lonely way, And brightest sunshine cease to gleam, And you in sorrow stray; And like some wearied, panting bird O'er faithless ocean driven, List to the voie you off have heard-' 'There is rest in heaven!' In the preceding chapter, we have alluded to a bro- ther of Kate Lenson's. We shall now take the liber- y to introduce this individual into the evening circle gatherd around the fireside of Deacon Pyrone. He was of a sanguine temperament; a large quan- tity of volatility was a part of his natural heritage, descending to himthrough the Lensnline. All views and things were to be -made subservient to the accom- plishment of one great aim; and in this aim was cen- tered the attainment of the fair hand of Elisiner Hon vert. The reader may conclude that the visits of Clar- Ience Nervourn to our pyoung friend, did not afford much pleasure to Byron eLenson. ,We will suffice i to say that this dark thought had found a lurking place in the bosom of this young man.   Meantime, :the youthfulness of Elisiner Hovert did not obscure iA'  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7571-00000038"/> 76 her mental vision. Oft-times, the penetration of the young, outweighs the conceived ideas of more ad' vanced persons. Let this be as it may; in -this case the veil was not so thickly woven, but that the true light was plainly discernible beyond the net-work. We do not wish to infer that duplicity towards Miss Hovert found lodging in the heart of Byron Lenson, -any farther than a wish to prevent the union between Clarence and herself. He determined that it should never be consummated. This gentleman had some evil propensities, as the reader will infer, ere long; and had he tried to conceal this evil by placing a hedge of kindness near the outskirts of his heart's door, how much trouble might have been prevented! But we -must allow his proceedings to speak for themselves.  ....      -ME At the end of a somewhat narrow road, which was lined on either side by high and low bashes, with here and there a small tree of ash, or oak and pine, rising proudly above their humbler neighbors, stood a little brown cottage.  It was altogether a sweet spot; a   " spot where one would love to linger. A little way beyond was a forest, and high elevations crowned with a rich, heavy growth of wood. A beautiful piece of land intervened between the cottage and these sombre hills, sparingly covered with majestic trees, and a rich undergrowth of land, and other wild shrubbery. The goddess of Nature seemed to dwell here, in all her pure, rural lovliness, and quiet, noble beauty. This spot was the patrimony of a widowed mother and her three children. i4i HThe eldest of these children was a son; his statue g being oyer six feet, his form symmetrical; dark chest- @ki ^ nut hair, a lofty brow which unmistakingly bespoke high, deep, untold thoughts. And had this individu- al bent these highly-bestowed gifts in the right di- rection, his life's bark would have -been spared many, a rough trip over the dark waters of remorse.  Anld this may well be said of nearly all of earth's frail children. Many a one, from misguided calcula- Di t tion, -sinks away into obscurity, or into a premature grave; whilst, had they earlier commenced a course- of good, such a course might ultimately have proved beneficial in promoting happiness. The second child was a; daughter; about eighteen: years of age, rather slender in fi-ure, and as slight as a young antelope; the jpossessor of a mlld blue Iv eye, light brown hair, and a c6mpletion beautifully l! iI white. Her voice was low, tender. and musical. Bu t- best of all, this young lady was a true Christian; the beautiful lustre of a quiet, unobtrusive star, marking her pathway through life with pure sunshine.- Per- haps the writer has a different view from the reader, of what is-termed a Christian life. Not wishing to enter into an argument about Re- ligion, in this work, I shall only take the liberty tW  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7571-00000039"/> say that in my humble opinion, there is religion in many things. For instance: what is better calcula- ted to inspire the soul with pure, holy ideas, than a retired ramble into Nature's gardens; the lofty mountains, or lesser hills, with green summits seem- ingly piercing the heavens, the place where the con- templative rambler is straying; the bold, dashing, foaming cataract, or the tiny, rippling streamlet; the craggy, unshapen rocks, down to the little, smoothly polished pebble, which lies at the bottom of some clear, running brook; the tiny wild flower nestled by some broken hedge , or the moss-covered stone 'neath some sheltering, ancient oak. Yes, all- these things inspire the soul with deep-rooted adora- tion. "Looking from Nature's works up to Nature's God;" let a firm, unshaken love for our Father in Heaven, ever dwell in all the hearts of His children, ever abounding in good works; works of love and charity; even sheltering the poor, unprotected person, who is unjustly suffering. from the pangs of that green-eyed monster, Slander. The soul may event- ually hope for rest from sorrow, when the unburdened spirit has taken its flight into unknown regions. We hope the reader will graciously pardon- the writer for this great digression from our story. We left off, when speaking of the widow's daugh. ter. As we were saying, she was Nature's own pure child. Ah! 'tis impossible to tire whilst contempla- ting nature in her transcendant lovliness.- How lovely when the charms of wisdom, virtue, and refined goodness of soul is added to personal accom- plishments! What a happy combination! What a fountain of felicitous enjoyment! The youngest child was a keen, bright-eyed boy of thirteen summers, who delighted in nothing as   79 much as teasing, or assisting his dear, kind sister, and instructress. His joy knew no bounds, when this sister returned from a some-what lengthy visit to New York, where they had formerly lived. Si   \ I The worthy Lenson family were much happier after they found themselves fairly domesticated in their new home, the pretty brown cottage. This rural homestead was a patrimony left Mrs. Lenson by hers father, who had previously occupied the position of f B   parish rector. Mrs. Lenson was, by birth, an English lady. When quite a child, she had accompanied her parents and grandparents to America; leaving their eldest child, a son, in England. They became very much pleased with the foresterial world this side of the Atlantic; and being very wealthy, soon erected a cottage, half English, and half American style. Mr. Elwell, Jr, (the son left in England,) had received a clerical education; and before leaving his'native shore, had taken orders, and filled a desk some time. Therefore, he officiated in this capacity here in the wilderness; often preaching in the open air, with the green trees forming a rich canopy over- head. It would be difficult to say what constituted the greater part of his congregation; the feathered vocalist, or four-footed animals, which roamed over the thickly-wooded hills and lowlands, or rational mankind. Most certainly the latter class in those days were not quite as numerous as they are at the\ present -era.  A few years, afterwards, the mother sickened, pining for her dear, familiar home, and the 4"Land- of our fathers."  So the little brown cottage was leased, for a certain term of years, to a middle-aged man; who, by way of profession, was a hunter of bears, ideer, foxes, and other animals that inhabited the dense woods. Mrs. Elwell died soon after her I   &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7571-00000040"/> 80 80 I3    arrival in England, and the grandfather followed shrortly afterwards. The brother of the young Henrietta (the children of Mr. Elwell Jr.) being some years her senior, thought, after their parents decease, that he possessed a right to exert unbounded authority over the affairs of his sister; even to the sacred matters' of the heart. Therefore, an English clerk was discarded through his influence, as he was determined that his fair sister should wed none save a rich gentle- man; forgetting that wealth alone does not purchase pure happiness. So the brother re-embarked for America, taking his sister with him; first attending to the business connected with the little brown cot- tage and the surrounding lands, which had been bequeathed by his parents to the young daughter, to be at her disposal when she should become-of a suitable age. They then proceeded to the city of   -, where the brother and sister had a dispute concerning certain family affairs; the brother short- ly afterwards returning to England, and the sister remaining in the city, where she was soon married to a mercantile gentleman, named Lenson. In this pleasant home, this amiable lady, when sporting in childhood's days, had spent many a hap- py, joyous year. Time had flown onward, and nowr she was a widow; left to grapple with life's cold realities; so she had come with her family to take up their abode in the little brown cottage, for the present.    - The late Mr. Lenson, a few years previous to her removal, had belonged to an extensive commercial house, where they had done a large business. But, owing to heavy failures, and multiplied losses, the firm was obliged to- separate for a time; perhaps sooner than would otherwise/ se been the case, had   I   it not been for the sudden decease of the eldest of the company. No one took the breaking up of this establishment more to heart than our merchant in question. After a few months had elapsed, Mr. Lenson started for the Western frontiers, trying to negotiate with the Indians for furs ; but accomplishing nothing satisfactory, he soon returned. An epedemic was at this time raging in the city, where his home was situated. This merchant fell a victim to this fearful disease, adding one only, to the great number who were -daily falling. A few weeks previous to Mr. Lenson's death, his son had returned from a distant seminary, where he had been placed six months before. He was greatly disheartened at the father's repeated misfortunes; but instead of trying to rise above embarrassments, and to try to stay the hands and heart of his surviving. parent, he, like many another inconsiderate youth, had reflected only on the obstacles which he should undoubtedly have to contend with, should he continue in perseverance to attain that height of position in the literary world, which his parents wished. The ambitious father had long nurtured plans for the promotion of this, his eldest son, in future years. So the disheartened ifil youth folded up the wings of "Press Onward," and was moved only by the current of events. After the death of Mr. Lenson, it was discovered that he had died insolvent. His widow was greatly disturbed at the state of affairs, and in this dilemma, had immediately sought refuge in the pretty brown cot- tage, at the end of the beautiful lane. It was one lovely morning, towards the end of llaughing May, that Mrs. Lenson, and her daughter  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7571-00000041"/> 82 Kitty stepped from their sunny door-way, leaving the merry-hearted Elbur to close the door behind them. This commission being fulfilled, he and his white-faced kitten and dog Ponto, were soon frolicking along in front of his mother and sister, in "right merry glee." "Well my son!" exclaimed the mother, with heart-felt pleasure; "you are making this place a fairy-land!" "How beautiful!" said the joyous Kitty. The boy smiled, and nodded pleasantly, showing that he-appreciated the compliments of his moth- er and sister; then turned to a place where his eld- :est brother was perched upon a stile, saying:- Come Elbur! get your hand-cart, and assist me in removing this rubbish to more suitable quarters. Yes, mother, I have not enjoyed myself so much since my father's death, as now. As you say, dear -mother, this little rural home must be a sort of fairy-land."  "And who are to be the fairies?" enquired Elbur. "Why, the ladies of course," answered Byron, "not you, Master Elbur, nor myself." "So-ho! the ladies, to be sure!" retorted the little rogue, pulling leaves from a bended twig, as he stood bye his little cart. Then running to where his -mother and sister were seated, he waved a green bough above their heads, shouting-"Arise! now and forever, you are to be regarded by my brother and myself, as fairies! Mother will be queen, and -sister Kitty princess s!" "Well, well, little mock-general; if your friends are converted into fairies, then of course they will not be subservient to picking up these chips after you!" The young rogue laughed as he sprang upon his   brothers shoulder, peeping round into his face in a: manner half-bewitching and halt-provoking, a' he exclaimed:- So-ho! brother, I am living high in the world, E H  and don't have to gather chips,either!" Hd    In a moment he slid down from his high seat, and' ran round the corner of the fence; returning in a moment, however, accompanied by Ponto, who carried between his teeth a small kid glove. This was duly examined, and found to be a very pretty one. "'The owner must have a very small hand," observed Mrs. Lenson. "Ah! I think we must let Byron have it then,"' said Elbur. "What, to wear?" said Kitty. "No; but to keep, until he finds the pretty own- er," said the rogue. "Come, brother, don't look so glum! Who knows but that this glove may belong to some fairy lady?" He then ran towards the cottage, drawing his cart after him, singing- "Brother Byron though handsome and tall, One tiny glove makes his heart fall." Byron ran after him, bearing in his arms several small trees, which he had taken up for the purpose of transplanting in the little West yard, only a few paces from the cottage. Now the sun is sinking in the West; evening's mantle will ere long draw her shadowy veil o'er earth's landscape, and fasten it with a sparkling brilliant borrowed from the arched canopy above. The day's labors at the cottage are suspended. The table-cloth, white as mountain snow, is spread with a bountiful supply of viands. Contentment, and unfeigned gratitude reigns around and within  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7571-00000042"/> i B                 84 the hearts of the partakers of these refreshments. InduStry, and a truly appreciative heart bestows much happiness upon earth's offspring. Byron's ambition had, in a great measure, become deadened, since his father's failure and death; but his energies were now arousing from their lethargic slumber, and he was now acting a right and consist- ent part, inl trying to promote that which would ulti- mately benefit himself, as well as his widowed moth- er, and her entire family. The favors which he everyday Conferred upon his family, made a great change in himself. He had been very unamiable of late; perhaps without knowing it, himself. Thus often do we imbibe unpleasant habits, with- out being really conscious of it ourselves; which, in the process of time, become almost like a second nature with us. And thus it behooves us all to be a little suspicious of encouraging gloomy habits. In the next chapter we shall find our young friends, Elisiner and Kitty Lenson, together with many of our valued acquaintances. Dark-eyed gloom ! we do not love thy shade; Thy breath leaves a feverish heat upon oui brow; As restlessly we seek our couch 'neath thy curtained canopy, Iet the unfurled banner of bright-eyed Hope and Mirth Wave their silken folds above our heads; throwing sombre gloom Far ba;ck into the still darker shade, where Every woe is congregated. Then let one wave of Silence throw the mantle of Oblivion o'er the whole. 'Tis foolish to be always picking out dark spots with which to pave our pathway, that leads to the tomb. Life, as we travel onward, brings unavoidable shadows to bear upon our march, without our incon- sistently adding to the gloom!   CHAPTER VL. "There are hours of woe and sadness, Which costs the heart a life of pain; Which chills the soul with dreams of maddess, And bids it never smile again. The heart, whose love is deeply blighted Must pine in grief, decay or die; It roams a desert; lone--benighted; Without a boon of solace nigh. The world may smile, and fortune brighten, As light wings gild the lonely sky; The clouds of grief they bid enlighten, And show what deserts intervene. Though dark the night, 'tis not forever, A  day-beam comes, in mercy given, Before its ray the storm-cloud$ sever, The wondering soul hath rest in heaven!" JAMES S. ALwARBD. We  must render justice; to  every character who has, or   is, to appear on  the platform ofur story therefore we  must  hasten  to say  that toe lady, Miss Foresetta. Walsingworth,   whom   we   introduced to the   eader as a  visitor at the house  of Mrs. Elwell.

Miss Walsingworth will not re-appear Lt   until we arrive near the- close of this narrative. We fear that the threats of this history are becoming entangled among wayside brambles. O  .     .0 But hark! the loud roar of the cannon is sending its thundering, booming sound through the air. The reports are deafening to my ears; even though at a distance of nine miles. I cannot proceed until I learn what intelligence has been sent on the tele- graphic wires. Oh, this is it! Norfolk is taken! The Merrimac is blown up by the Rebels! and they are making destructive work with their own property! The year 1862 will tell a shocking story upon the pages of history; time will never wipe out the stain from American History! No, NEVER! ' The echo of this great national embroilment between the North and -South, will speak from the historian's page, and upon the memory of the now existing generation; and ;i   a rehearsal of these events will, at an early day, be implanted upon the minds of the yet unborn genera- tion. Now all is quiet! - The nerves of the writer have again gained their usual equilibrium, and the emit- tings of light from the full round moon, are so vivid- ly bright, that*the supply of light is ample, and my pen glides over the paper without obstruction. *'        ' v o . O '  , o We will now follow the path where we may find Mr. and Mrs. Elwell, and their pet son Herbert. We find them at their home. Little Herbert's small, f                  ,     r   87 round, dimpled cheek rests upon the snowy arm of the young mother. His father has fallen asleep over his newspaper, in a remote corner of the chamber. The night-lamp has expended all its fluid; "the dreamerl dreams." But see! the charms of Morpheus are uncerimoniously broken; the slumberer is hurri- edly aroused by aloud gust of wind, and the mewing of pussy upon the window-sill, who was scratching away in earnest, trying to effect an entrance to more comfortable quarters. After Mr. Elwell had settled these preliminaries (that of fastening the aforesaid window-shutter, and waiting upon Miss Grimalkin down into the cellar,) he wisely concluded that a feather-bed would be more acceptable than a chair; so, after taking a few strides across the apartment, in accordance to his feelings, he retired to his couch. Agitations (un- known to our reader for the present) prevented this gentleman from his needed repose. O   O    O   O   O - ,  Now readers, if you wish, we will proceed with our story about the little old East garet, without far- ther parley. Meantime, we hope that the interest in our narra- tive is not lost, nor even waving. If there is any indication of such an event, we would suggest the propriety of calling a beautiful white-winged bird, who will instantly fly at your bidding. nestling. in X  the hearts dwelling, sweetly whispering-"Patience and -interest."

"Why not?" enquired his kind sister, with evident concern. "1 am happy." I don't dispute this assertion in the least," retort- ed the refractory brother. "Byron, I will qualify this assertiqn of mine, if you wish it?" , I wish it, then; and am waiting to hear it. But remember, Miss Kate, I am no participator in your joy, nor any other person's." "You are aware, Byron, tlat our kind father is in heaven; but we have left a kind, estimable mother, who-" Well, did Hever deny it?" interrupted the broth- er, crossly. The sister continued:- "Our little brown cottage is the sweetest, coziest spot on earth. How well it accords with our present feelings! Then Byron, there are our pleasant acquaint- ances. For instance; Deacon Pyrone's family; and especially that lady's niece, Elisi'ner Hovert, and dear, precious little Dora;: and ever the merry- hearted Willie, too!" Take care! good, kind, generous Kate! your sisterly steps are in close proximity to a spot which will be terribly shaken ere long! "( Why, dear brother, you look terribly agitated!" But receiving no answer, either in the negative or in the affirmative, Kate continued- "You certainly cannot dislike the family; for you know that they stand high in the estimation of every body around here. It is true we have resided in this locality but a short time, and Lady Pyrone appears rather austere; but, notwithstanding this, she is decidedly a good person. We must notalways o This conversation occurred before Dora's death.   89 judge people from outward appearances, for if this d were a fixed rule, my brother would not shine in the agreeable class of society." Kate was becoming so engrossed with the subject of her friends at the Pyrone Mansion, that she did not notice her brother's disturbed appearance, as he paced the room. "I really love my newly-found friend Elisiner! she is so amiable, that I think my brother will learn to appreciate her, as I do, in time." "Hush! for heaven's sake!" This command was accompanied by a most furious laugh. The fine manly countenance was horribly distorted by the force of inner emotions. A sad look stole over the sister's face, as she whis- pered-  "Brother, I am distressed that I have offended you, but I was not aware of your dislike towards this family, until now." "Have you heard, or seen anything that has led you to think that I do not -appreciate your newly-. acquired acquaintance, Miss Kate?" asked  the brother in a sharp tone.  "No'-no-brother, but " "But what?" demanded Byron, fiercely.  "Oh, nothing now; A tear moistened the eye of the affectionate sister, as she arose to leave the apartment, evidently deeply distressed at her brother's unkind manner. Kate was -a noble girl! We presume that our readers are already aware, that she was afterwards. the boon companion of our heroine in her rambles through the noted Easl garret. The reader will perceive that we have retraced our steps quite a distance, in order to present each char- acter as they are, or have been introduced to their notice.,  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7571-00000045"/> I x/ b               90 For a long time Byron Lenson sat just as his siis ter had left him, his face buried in his hands; well knowing that her, heart was all gentleness, and that her forgiveness for his recent uncalled for rudeness, could easily be obtained. It was cruel for him to repulse such a devoted, well-tried friend as his Sister Kitty had proved herself to be. "Well," soliloquized Byron. "Kate may well be happy, with little to disturb her gentle nature. They speak of Christians; well, I suppose that she, belongs to that class, as my most excellent mother does; and this makes the great difference. As for myself--miserable  wretch as I am!-I have no such solace to sooth my tortured soul." The reader wishes to learn why this young man is in such a perplexing dilemma. One afternoon, a few days after the finding of the Md4 glove, Kitty, with her little brother- bur, was out searching for wild flowers in an adjacent pasture, when: her attention w" diverted from  the flower- gathering, by hearing a low, musical voice, warbling; forth a part of a. sweet sonnet. Nearer and nearer came the sweet songstress, and Kitty, parting the. branches of a low clump of alders, saw through the space, a lovely young girl, slowly advancing towards the spot where the listeners were partially concealed by the bushes. The lady Wore an expression on her countenance, which, if once beheld, would never be. /forgotten. The brother and sister resumed, their search for flowers, and in a few moments the parties came in contact. A nod was exchanged on both sides. Elbur caught his sister's hand, and exclaimed :- 'Oh, how beautiful she is! another fairy, sister, just like yourself." With a sweet smile and a small spice of embarrass   "1 ment and pleasure mingled together, the lady of song said-  -  I presume that I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Lenson?" "You have," was Kate's response," and it is an unexpected pleasure to'myself that I now meet the niece of Deacon Pyrone?" "You are right, " returned Miss Hovert. "I should be most happy to have: you walk to the, cottage with me." "Thank you, Miss Lenson. I came out this after- noon partly for that purpose." Thus mutually pleased with one another, they con- tinued chatting. The flowers that Kate had found were displayed for the inspection of her companion, who proved to be quite a botanist. Elisiner informed Kitty that as there was a sus- pension. of the school which she attended, she had been intending to pay her new neighbor a call, also to act as. bearer of her aunt's apologies for not calling on the new-comers before, as the unexpected arrival of company had prevented it. Kitty was much pleased to learn that there was- a. school for young ladies at a distanee of one mile and a half from her home. "Allusions were made about returning to the wid- ows cottage. They had been descending. a- narrow' footpath, when Elbur, who was frolicing on. ahead of' the girls, suddenly leaped over the wall, and with a hard cuffon Ponto's shaggy head, loudly exclaimed :- Let go, you dog! let go that glove.! Yon didn't' find it, you naughty dog; you stole it,. you know you did!" "Why don't Kitty and Elbur return?" inquired Mr Lenson of Byron. I. will go and seek. them if you wish, mother," returned Byron.  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7571-00000046"/> 92 "I am  not concerned about their absence," returned the mother, "only Kate was intending to finish out the blank leaf of your letter; and the Caledonian sails the day after to-morrow, and it must be forwarded in time for the packing." "Oh yes! I wonder that Kate can be so unmind-  ful," said the young man, rising. So, suiting the action to the word, he was soon bending his way up the gently-sloping hill, which led to the spot where his sister had informed her mother that she should go to search for May-flowers. Twilight was stealing softly over the surrounding landscape. On the left of this'foot-path, were three little hills, rising one above another like steps to some grand  amphitheater of trees and shrubs. And indeed,   ; nature's scenery is full of varied views. "Why Elbur, why are you whipping your dog so?"  "Enough, Mister Byron, it was very good in Ponto  to pick up a glove, but not quite so good to steal i the mate to it out of Miss Hovert's hat."  "Child, what do you mean? Explain yourself," said the brother. a It needs no explanation," retorted the hero of the glove, petulantly. There was no necessity for Elbur's complying with this last request of his brother's, for a laugh from the ladies gave a clue to the desired information. Byron stood a moment to contemplate the group; when he saw that he was observed, he advanced towards the young ladies, and was introduced by  Kate to her young, friend.  "My brother, Byron Lenson; Miss Elisiner Hovert, I i the niece of Deacon Pyrone."  Byron joined in the laugh about the glove when Kate informed Miss Hovert about Ponto's finding its mate.   93 Elisiner now declined the invitation to the brown cottage, as it was growing late; and she must retrace her steps home-wards; but not alone, for the happy trio accompanied her, and conversed long at the gate, until twilight's shade had deepened into somber shadows. Byron thought- "Long would I linger by her side; till the last glimmering star had drawn her veil of darkness over the land, and the presence of angels throws a hal- lowed brightness o'er the soul." Yes, Byron Lenson's sun had suddenly crossed his path! The rain was sprinkling the earth, a few mornings after the above occurrence, when a young girl, not heeding its liberal drops, wended her way to the abode of suffering poverty. There was a French- woman, partially blind, whose husband had once acted in the capacity' of second mate on the brig "Hope- well," who had seen Elisiner, and, being, a sensible woman herself, she had discovered the girl'smnative goodness of heart, therefore an, intimacy had sprung up between the two. Elisiner always made it a point of' duty as well ap pleasure, to visit this person whenever she could do so without encroaching upon her other labors. This woman was a Christian, walking daily in the path that she thought her Maker had desired that she should, in order to obtain the rest which remain- eth for the people of God. Here, in the abode of contentedipoverty, Elisiner had often drank deeply from the fount of Christian consolation, her compan- ion no other than the gifted Clarence Nervourn, generally. '  "  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7571-00000047"/> I              -  94 At the time in question, Elisiner carried some nice house plants: also an orange and some figs. The last-named luxuries were presents to herself from school-mates; but the truly sincere pleasure which it would give her to appropriate them to the comfort of the old blind lady, would fully compensate her for her self-denial. Elisiner had promised Clarence that she would con- tinue these calls quite frequently, during his absence; this freely-given promise she now performed to the letter. This mornings visit was longer than her calls were, generally. When she was returning homne- ward, she was somewhat startled by coming quite suddenly upon a stranger, who was lying asleep a little way out of the lane, nearly enveloped in the tall grass and wild flowers, which grew plentifully along the sides of this green lane. To all appear. ances, he must have seen nearly seventy summers, as his features were much wrinkled. The astonished maiden noticed a peculiarity about the sleeping stranger; the falling down of heavy masses of dark, wavy hair, then in close proximity, a profusion of snowy-white hair. She stepped cau- tiously aside, so that she need not be observed by the stranger, whenever he should awaken ; which, in all probability, he would do, shortly, as he had moved several times, as if troubled by restless dreams. The next moment he was fully aroused, and stood upon his feet. He peered keenly about him, as far on each side as his optical vision could penetrate, then sinking down upon his grassy couch, he exclaimed: "Ah! woe is me! no doubt the hounds are hotly pursuing me!" Then, in an excited manner, he addressed God, ,  . '   95 entreating his watchful protection. This short peti- tion-every syllable of it-seemed to come from the depths of a tortured, abused heart. The sudden discharge of a gun in the adjacent woods, caused a terrified expression to flit across the countenance of the stranger. ( Good God! they come!" he exclaimed. A moment more, and all was quiet. The innocent huntsman, doubtless, had passed out of the forest, on his way homeward. There was something in the demeanor of this old man that caused a thrilling sensation to leap o'er the soul of the maiden, as she stood in the green, shady road, in the guise of a pitying angel. That voice had a peculiar sweetness, that caused a pleasing, yet sad feeling, as of other days, to sweep. its vibrating chords over her heart. His eyes were now plainly visible; they wore a  sorrowful expression, thus beariig a striking contrast to the haggard features. His form seemed bent at a first glance, which the maid attributed partly to his age, and partly to the crouching position which he ihad assumed when asleep. He was pursued, without doubt; else, why so startled at the sudden discharge of a gun in the distance? And more than all,-the sentences which had so hastily escaped his lips; words so fraught with terror and fear. Even the fear of death was depicted in his eye, as he sprang up from is half-sitting posture, on the grassy couch. Then , -4 he bent his ear to the ground, placing himself in a listening attitude. Soon, however, he stood perfectly erect, seemingly well satisfied that no danger was to be apprehended on that score, as all sounds were gradually dying away in the distance. Elisiner was in a very unpleasant position; she knew not whether to move forward, or to remain i8 :  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7571-00000048"/> i s , quiet in her sheltered covert. Whilst she was still undecided us to what course of action it was best to' pursue, she found herself listening quite attentively to the touching words of the fugitive. "Ah me! how wretched I am, and without deserv- ing to be so." The old man drew his kerchief from a side pocket, and wiped his eyes; then rising, he moved forward in the very direction where Elisiner was screened from his view by a low clumb of alders. His form seemed proudly erect now. ' What a noble form!" thought Elisiner. She again heard his low, solemn voice:- "Long-yes, very long it has been since I have basked in the glad sunshine of friendship. Never again may I linger by the holy riverlet of love!" Then he slowly, emphatically clasped his hands above his brow, ejaculating--( Ah! sinful man, mur- mur not! The Father of all mankind is just. ' I will still continue to trust and adore Him, and He will, in good time, deliver me from the oppression of my: cruel foes. My innocence will, sooner or later, be declared, and put to shame my unjust accusers." The attitude of the maid, during this short solilo- quy, was profoundly reverential. Just then, however, Ponto, Elbur Lenson's little dog, came bounding over the low wall in pursuit of a squirrel. Espying Elisiner, he bounded to her side, giving one short bark of recognition. The quick ear, and eye of the stranger had fathomed all, as the alders parted to admit the dog's chubby body, and revealed Elisiner sitting inside. The maid perceived a movement of the stranger's hand, towards his vest pocket; a movement which- did not exactly suit her state. of mind. She had an instinctive, and mortal fear of firearms in the hands     97 of an infuriated person, as she firmly believed this person to be; yet, she felt in her heart that he had been, and was, unjustly persecuted. Indeed, she was deeply interested in the fate of this singular person- age; insomuch, that she was determined tastep from her obscure position, and befriend him, if her services were solicited. And she did so accordingly. With a countenance perfectly composed, she stepped into the path, and stood calmly before him, waiting for him to speak. The man gazed a moment, apparently amazd. Then advancing towards her, he extended a hand- somely-formed hand, which was in keeping with his eloquent, dark eyes. "Young lady, I am in your power; yes, comr#4.\ so. That you have been an observant spectator of my recent agitation, is apparent." I have indeed, sir," was her just and respectful answer. "You will not betray me to any one, should any one chance to question you as to my whereabouts?" The maiden was perplexed, but her countenance had not undergone the remotest change, whilst his eye was riveted upon it; but when he continued speaking, her feelings were indescribable towards this unknown, unhappy individual. But reader, for the present, we must let a shadowy cloud drop over the agitated feelings of both parties. Ere long the wand of truthfulness, with one sweep, will dispel the overhanging mists, and the flag i  of right will usurp that of the wrong, and all dark- I I ness will flee. Commanding her voice, the your g girl replied:- "No sir, never by any word or act of mine, shall you be betrayed. No, never, if you are an innocent person." ', .I.9 .  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7571-00000049"/> :    I  . \        98 "Innocent I am, indeed, of the horrid crime charged against me. But no vile hand shall mana- cle this form of mine, without rueing it!" Elisiner could not forbear thinking how changed that maiy form had become within a few moments; at first it was bent as if by age, and now it was proud and erect. "His lofty, majestic bearing, " thought Elisiner," might well vie with the noble sons' of Rome." "'By the law made by erring man I have been cftdemned'to meet the doom of a murderer." The stranger shuddered, fervently raising his eyes to heaven, as if mentally invoking the interference of God in his behalf. "Where do you propose going?" asked Elisiner. "To some place of safety for the present; that is, if such a place is to be found hereabouts. I feel that I shall not find a place of entire security on this side of the Atlantic." They were startled by a slight movement in the neighboring bushes. It proved, however, to be noth- ing but a large bird fluttering from bush to bush. i"Sir, a short distance from here is a huge ledge of rocks. It is supposed by many to have been rent at the crucifixion of Christ. Its form, when entire, must have presented the appearance of a bowl. It seems to have been cut in the form of an apple. This rock is thus parted at its base, so as to leave quite a little space wherein a person may safely seclude himself from observation. Moreover, the inside of one of these quarters of the ledge is sepa- rated from the larger part, and forms some-thing resembling an arched roof." "Thank you, sweet, kind lady, for this intelligence. I think that I shall avail myself of this security. But," he'added, "I fear not the face of day- in fair or   O   " foul play, but circumstances entirely alter cases. My doom is sealed; and unless I can, for a time, avoid my pursuers, - "Flee! flee! they come!" exclaimed the maiden. But, ere the sentence was completed, the fugitive, with the noiseless step of a spirit had retreated with such rapidity into the depths of the wood, that noth- ing but a flitting sense of his disappearance remained to the bewildered girl. There was little time left her for thought; she had barely time to compose her feat- ures, and to assume a calm exterior, when a hdrse- man appeared around the winding road. One glance behind satisfied Eliainer that this person was the pursuer; and she gave a sigh of relief to find that the pursued was out of sight and sound. On he came, the horse puffing, and his sides steam- ing. The man halted near Elisiner, and touching his hat, said, somewhat blandly:-- - "Miss, I must detain you for a few moments, to ask you a few questions." "What authority have you for so doing?" "The authority of my office." Elly bowed mechanically. "Have you seen a man hereabouts, my pretty wild bird? "Sir, I have not been walking in the woods. I have but recently returned from a visit made to a friend."  - "Certainly, you must have seen if any one had crossed your ph?" "Sir, I do not consider myself blind." "Ah! you are either inclined to be saucy or crafty, Miss." The man/spoke in a hateful tone. Neither, sir. I hope that duplicity is not numbered among mf faults!"  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7571-00000050"/> P-/ And Elisiner started to walk along, when she was again intercepted by the horse and his rider; the head of the former coming nearly in contact with her own. "Have you been on this road long?" persisted her tormentor. "The time, sir, that it has taken me to come from yonder cottage, where dwells a sick friend. " "And have you seen anybody?" ' Why, as to that, if you consider the birds, and squirrels, and crows,' anybody,' why I have seen plenty of them. And," she continued, "I expect pretty quick to meet a friend, who is coming to meet me." "To cut the matter short, have you seen a man? say, a man of thirty or forty, walking pretty fast?" "No sir, I have seen no person answering to that description. A short time previous toyour coming pe,' I saw two small lads crossing yonder piece of green sward, probably on their way to the snares, in yonder wood." The officer said musingly "I suppose, then, that you are ignorant of the whereabouts of the escaped villian?" "If not too inquisitive, sir, I would ask what crime is charged to the man of whom you are in search?'" "There is a dark saying about him. He has been found out to have performed a tragic act, ending in, a foul murder. He is condemned, aud must die." "Die!" reiterated the girl. "Yes, 'die ;' in order to satisfy the demands of jus-- tice, if he can be found. He must be somewhere in this vicinity, and I am determined to ferret him out, if anybody can." He'then turned himself in the Saddle, and cast a keen glance around and beyon&amp; the surrounding woodland; his gestures fully betraying the fiendish thirst and longing for the time to arrive when he   101 could exercise his authority upon the wretched victim. I If the person whom you are pursuing is really guilty, and deserving of the penaltiy of death, it is imy earnest wish that you may be successful in find- ing him. If not, I hope and trust that all your efforts to find him will prove unavailing; for it is an account which the judge and jury must settle before God, if they sentence a human being to death upon circum- stantial evidence. What beautiful truths were spoken by this lovely young girl,as she stood in the narrow green lane, fac- ing the restless steed and hard-hearted rider; her young-face radiant with purity. She looked like some pitying spirit from .the upper, bright world, who had descended on the wings of love to plead against the oppression of innocence. The stern officer gazed up- on the maiden for a moment, whilst his hard features softened! Then moving on, with alow, respectful bow, he said- "Well, young miss, I believe that you are about half right ;" then touched spurs to his horse, and shot off with the speed of Jan arrow. The maiden remained motionless a moment, pon- dering upon the singular events which had so unex- pectedly opened and closed before her view. "Ah," thought she, "perhaps, after all, his soulmay not be entirely void of honor; perhaps some sweet, drops of humanity may still linger about his hearst Oh! that gthey who are invested with power. tigti drink from the streams of benificence, and gath- from thence a love of true justice, and above all, i:: fear of God. I believe that this pbor stranger is in- nocent," she -murmured sadly, as she moved onward. Then she questioned her own heart, to see if sahe had strayed from the path of truth. He asked me if I had met a man of about thirtiy  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7571-00000051"/> 102 or forty; I answered truthfully that I had not, for the person whom I iret seemed very old and bent." Even now Elisiner was puzzled about the appearance of the stranger; in all probability, however, the unusual brilliancy of his eye, and the erectness of his form, was owing to his extreme agitation. She did not doubt in her mind that he was an innocent person, and, for the twentieth time, hoped that he would escape his pursuers. Wishing to rest and reflect, she turned and walked up a narrow path into the woods, where she was greeted by the wild, beautiful warbling of the birds. Seating herself upon the mossy steps of a towering rook, her mind dwelt sadly upon the fate of the stranger. Not even Nature's grand works could divert the thoughts of our heroine; neither the rocks clothed in velvety moss, nor the church spire glistening through the leafy foliage, northedash- ing sound of cascades over rocks. Elly still lin- gered in her mossy seat, though the low bushes and grass, were still wet after the morning's shower. Her visit to the cottage had beef considerably longer than such visits were usually; so it was now some time past the noon of day. She retraced her steps down the little footpath towards the lane. She could not forbear turning aside from the main road, to pass in the vicinity of the so-called Fortress Rock, to the spot where she, in company with her lover, Clarence Nervourn, had often strolled. Clarence had once observed that this huge ledge looked like some mighty architectural ruin. Elisiner was of a reflective turn of mind, and liked studying into' nature's laws; though it must be con- fessed that she stood aloof from this position now,  and was soon seated in the arbor of gloomy abstract- edness. She dwelt long and painfully upon the re-   103 miniscences of other days; she thought of stern dif- ficulties which she had timidly, but finally overcome. She wishad to press onward and onward until sweet plaudits from kind teachers sounded their joyful peals through her soul, breaking open the buds hitherto sealed,of undying hope and felicity. Elisiner was ambitious; she would fain have attained the high- est pinnacle of science. The surface of a mind, generally placid, was trou- bled this afternoon. Her mind is reverted to the years of her early childhood. Again she isestanding beside her loved parents, one hand resting in that of her father's, whilst a beautiful smile lighted the fea- tures of the mother. Then there were rides into the open country; walks by moonlight by the still, bright waters of the Hudson; the little lakelet with the lil- es resting so purely on its bosom; and the sails up and down in their light skiff, which was moored by the old tree at the foot of a large hill, which was often honored with the title of mountain. Then there was old Aunt Judy, the colored nurse of the youthful Hoverts, and a true friend to the parents; and bro- ther Lawrence, who always accompanied them in their rambles and sails. But now, alas! the fond father was dead. Again, the pleasant institute at M   1, and the noble principal, Professor Alberta Morrell, arose in her mind's eye, and in the dim, shadowy distance, she beheld sweet, loving faces bent over her, at the parting hour. These, and other scenes of early years of prosperity, came floating through the aisles of the maiden's memory. But she solemnly uttered:- A Father's hand is in all! yes all! Not a sparrow falleth to the ground without our Father's notice. God careth for all his children.  And now a few sounds of melody floated to the   &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7571-00000052"/> I                104 young girrs ear, proceeding from- the little brown cot- tage, where Kitty Lenson was performing upon her parlor organ. A tame goat, which the elder brother had recently purchased for Elbur, scampered along to meet Elly. A faded blue ribbon was fastened about the neck of this pet, and long ends were at- htached, to serve as reins, probably; as the young mas- ter had been using this animal as a "horse." How- ever, she had now given him the slip; or, perhaps, had broken away from a post where-Elisiner remem- bered to have seen her tied, to crop the fresh green grass thereabouts. Mr. Williams owned a small, 'surly cur, who had recently committed depredations in the neighborhood, by killing sheep. Now Mr. Williams was, with this exception,one of the best of neighbors. It was thought that the dog should be despatched; though it is -true that he had received severe punishment at the hands of his master, and fit compensation had been made for the loss of the sheep. Elisiner could not discern the form of Linda/Low, (the name that Kitty and Elbur had given to their favorite,) at a little distance, when she heard the hateful Lep coming down an opposite hillock. She immediately thought of self-defence, though the'dog had never shown any peculiar dislike for herself. On came the animal---Elly had only time to snatch iup ;' .a cart stake that lay by the road-side. Poor Linda "   had halted and now stood!within a few feet of her, trembling with instinctive fear. Lep did notfappear to notice Elly's approach, but gave one short growl, snapped his teeth, and gave a quick bound towards the poor goat's throat; Linda made a sudden spring over the low fence; the brute sprang over after her: and caught her by one hind leg, thus holding her fast.   105 Poor little creature! Elly did not run away in fright, but, with a force hitherto unknown to herself, dealt a severe blow on the dog's shoulder, which com- pletely prostrated him. Then she ran to the assist- ance of Linda, who, in spite of her bitten limb; was' trying to extricate herself from the twigs of a low bush where she was made fast by the strings getting twisted around it. As soon as she was freed, however, she ran limping down the path towards the little 'brown cottage. Good afternoon, Miss Hovert," said some person close to Elisiner. "Have you seen anything of Lin- da?" "Oh yes, there she goes!" answered Elisiner, point- ing to the goat. But Before anything further could be said, the en- raged animal had. regained his legs, and now made a thrust at Elbur. Now this little fellow was as cour- ageous a boy as could 'be found within a thousand miles if the hills of New Hampshire. i "If I could only get at my knife," he said, "I'd teach the beast better manners. Give him a blow!" i And the dauntless girl did give him such a' blow as rendered the brute unfit for further ugliness. The blow cracked his skull; he gave one kick, then a few struggles, and he,was dead.  : "Hurrah! hurrah!" shouted the boy. "What is all this noise about? Why such demon- stratipns of joy?" said a ianily voice, as Byron Len- son appeared to view. "See Byron!"' shouted Elbur, pointing to the dead dog. See-Miss Ellsiner's killed him, whilst he had his tushes firmly set in my shoulder! and my arm, too; I guess, by the feeling'." Byron advanced towards Elisiner with extended hands. He was astonished at the power of the beau-  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7571-00000053"/> I                106 tiful girl, but forebore making many comments, for fear that he might offend her keen delicacy. He greatly admired the merits of our young herpide. The escape of the pet, Linda, was soon found out, and Elisiner was thanked over and over again for her interposition. Kitty and Elbur wished her to accept Linda as a'present from them; but she declined, knowing how great a pet she was. She was greatly exhausted, both in mind and body. On her way back to the mansion, she mat- Willie, accompanied by good old dog Tiger. '"Why Elly, how long you have been gone! Aunt Amelia is really worried about your long silence, so ;ent Tiger and myself to look after you. I hope the poor French woman is not worse; is she Elly?" "No, my dear boy, but she is really -very, feeble indeed." Elisiner wished very much to be left alone; so after satisfying Miss Amelia and her aunt in regard \ to her long absence, she retired to her own chamber to reflect over the curious scenes which she had wit- nessed. "Poor man " she murmured. "I hope that he will get clear of his enemies. Yes, reader, our young friend had planted a noble rose-bud of peace in the garden of her heart, be- side other green, thriving vines, well laden with sweet, blossoming flowerets of "love, and good will to all.'" , Mr. Williams was not offended in the least, when he learned the truth about his dog; on the contary, he was much pleased at the bravery and kindness displayed by our young friend. Several evenings after the events just described, when the moon, with her sparkling attendants, sailed in the blue canopy of heaven, merry voices were   107 heard in the vicinity of the Pyrone Mansion. The rich notes of a flute and clarinet swept its musical march through a forest of sugar maples; other mel- odies lent their soothing charms; the sweet, per- fumed breath of flowerets, just previous to the folding up of their fragrant petals, was wafted upon the breeze of evening. Happy feet skipped over the somewhat neglected garden walks, leading about the old mansion. Playing, singing, and telling stories was the order of the evenings  When all were ready to leave, up stepped Grandson Hendrick, to make a few remarks; saying, among other things, he had the honor to niake a presentation to Miss Elisiner Hovert, for her bravery in saving, not only, the petted kid, but, perhaps, the life of Elbur Lenson. All were agreeably surprised, with the exception of the stately Mrs. Pyrone. She, however, had the prudence to smother this unkindness under ain assumed mask of complacency. The presents were: A beautifully bound Bible, with golden clasp; two historical volumes; a neatly made willow basket; a handsomely curved kid, a present afterwards found to be from Byron Lenson. It was evident that this young gentleman had bestowed much care and labor upon this gift, as it was perfect in form and feature, though it had received its finish at a shop some thirty miles distant. Then there was an embroidered sacque, a gift from Kitty, and a riding-whip from Eibur, the owner of the rescued kid. There were other, smaller presents, showing that our friend Elisiner was a loved, petted being; but all this; petting did not awaken vanity within her breast. Not that our heroine had no faults; for -there is not one of us who is exempt from blem- ishes of some kind.  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7571-00000054"/> 108 A few evenings after the above visit, Elisiner ac- companied Kitty home to the little brown cottage, as the latter had been spending the day with her. All the inmates of the cottage were well pleased when they saw Elly coming down the little foot-path, over the hill, through the orchard. Elbur ran to her side, and commenced speaking of herlittle cousin Dora. "This little cousin of yours,Miss Elly, is a dear little girl!" Yes, she is a very good child. But, Elbur, why do you think and speak so much about Dora?" "Why, early this morning, mother wanted me to hurry and finish feeding the birds, because she wanted me to go up to the deacon's, to enquire if any one was going to the office to-day," "Well, what then?" said Kate. ," Please wait, Miss Kate, until I finish what 1 was intending to say. Well, this little fairy Dora told me about her chickens, and showed me a little, lame, spotted one, which she said was her own, given to her by her father. Oh, what a round face, and pretty curls she has! just like a little angel girl in my new book." And the boy-fairly clapped his hands in the height of his admiration for the child Dora. Elisiner was amply repaid for making this visit. She found in Mrs. Lenson a well cultivated mind, free from the foolish conventionalisms which are generally attached to the characters of persons who have once figured in high life. This lady was well skilled in penetrating the depths of the human heart. This friendship, now in the bud, soon ripened into permanent bloom. And good, amiable Kate, too! The wings of friendship dropped the gentle dews of congeniality around the hearthstone of the Widow ' K   BLenson. ti i' (   , -109 But reader, there was one heart that beat in tum- ultuous joy, whenever Elisiner made one in this fiendly circle. But this joy was-dimmed when he attempted to penetrate into the mysteries of the ft- ture. We do not mean the futurity beyond this vale of woes; for the mind of -Byron Lenson but seldom  dwelt upon such themes. Perhaps it would have been Eta:  better for him if he had. He wished, (and Hope crowned this wish) to win the fair hand and heart of i  - ' Flisiner Hovert. Bright eyes were shining through I^)V A the flowery garland of hope, but alas!, they were dim- med with pathetic fears. Deep gloom   gathered around the temple of his heart. A low, dirge-like sound swept through his soul. But reader, Byron Lenson's temper was not a very tame one; his pur- posevonce fixed, he was determined that it should not be frustrated, though he o'erleaped all bounds of con- sistency. "Let come weal or woe," he soliloquized, "I am determined to win the fair girl's hand and heart I never loved before; I thought that my heart was sealed against the charms of women. But she is only to be seen and knojiM, and the heart immediately pays adoration to her. But what," said he, suddenly, "if her heart is preoccupied! No matter; I will sup- plant whoever the possessor may be, even if he should prove to be my dearest friend." Now reader, you must go- back with us, a short dis- tance. We have told you how the friendship between Elisiner Hovert and Kitty Lenson commenced, and how it has progressed thus far; and we have also in- formed you of the unaccountable gloom of Byron Lenson. It was during this season of gloomy ab- I straction, that Kate found her brother, and inquired why he wore such a direful countenance; at the time when her kind solicitude was so unfeelingly repulsed.  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7571-00000055"/> 1a          O110 Kate Lenson's name was soon registered upon thie list of pupils of Miss Clay's school. Thus these two ;friends studied, sang, and walked together in the closest intimacy. Let us see! we have dropped a few stitches; but we will endeavor to find the right thread, and take them up in due form. I believe that Kate was expecting her brother to escort her home on a certain. Saturday eve. Elisiner, as we have seen, did not object, nor did she seem pleased at Byron's intended visit. The lead was not  so heavy but that she could weigh it in the scales of her discernment. In the next chapter we shall introduce many occur. rences which are now drowsing behind the curtain. "Truth is stranger than fiction," evenif written in a fictitious style.   I ,. CHAPTER VIL "The sky is blue above my head, And to the glad embrace of spring The west wind hastens, like a bird Who seeks her mate on sweeping wing. But still within my bosom dwelleth Sad discontent, where'er I stray; And with its restless murmur, telleth, Sweet love, that thou art far away." H. PETERSON. Lawrence Hovert had been for some time, a resident of sunny Italy. He had two views for remaining in this land of melting showers, and sun-cheering rays; but the prominent reason was, to give his mental, as well as physical powers, rest. The sweet quietude of repose was needed, and rest, which would renovate his sinking organs. Little has been said of this personage, thus far; though he will make a prominent figure in our history. He was the only son of Widow Ho- vert. His college course had ended some three years previous to the commencement of our history.  He had no more than left these classic halls, ere he per- ceived that his father's (Colonel Hovert) wealth was on the wane. The high ambition of this youth had unlike many become weakened at the citadel; but his soul was newly, and nobly aroused with energetic purposes; He had left college, carrying with him the unfeigned friedship of professors and' students, wowned with the weaths of unfading laurel. He  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7571-00000056"/> "2 hastened homeward to assist his father in any meas- ure that might prove necessaty, in order to facilitate proceedings which the colonel had in contemplation relative to the securing of his property. After the final scene of his parent's death (which occurred shortly after the son's arrival,) the son set himself to work to regain some of the property which rightfully belonged to the widow and her child- ren. For a time all seemed useless. Placing his mnother and younger sisters in as comfortable quar- ters as his limited income would admit, he employed   1 his uncle (a gentleman of great benevolence of heart) to keep watch of the movement of certain unprinci- pled men, who' had had dealings with his father's property. Then, in company with his early friend, Clarence Nervourn, he visited his sister Elisiner who tad resided in the family of Deacon Ralph Pyrone since her father's death. Afterwards he returned'to Philadelphia, where he spent some years in the study of law. In due time he was admitted to the bar, officiating for a sufficient length of time to fully con- vince the judges, and others of the fraternity, that his abilities on decision of character were not of an' ordinary stamp. A keen perception, and unwavering determination, manifested itself in all his undertak- ings. He had, thus far, acquitted himself with honor, in matters of moment, and entire success had crowned all his legal proceedings. 'Some time previous to Lawyer Hovert's visit to his mother, he had won laurels for himself in a cause wherein otherrs had failed. \This error occurred either from ignorance or bribery. The case was this: A father died,' and previous to his demise had given into the poesession of his only son, a deed ofi some landed property. This tract of land ran along the margin of a stream, and upon the opposite side was a   "8 corresponding tract, owned by waperson who, in for- mer years,.had quarrelled with his neighbor," so that acrnel grudge had been kept up between the parties, until the time of the death of the above-named gen-- tleman. And now that an opportunity was opened where he might wreak his vengeance on the only surt- viving heir of this old foe, he was by no means back- ward in bestowing a plentiful shower of wrath on the unprotected head of said son; forgetting the blessed rule of our Saviour, to do good, and forgive all. The wicked mind of this man was set into active motion to turn out some scheme whereby he might, obtain possession of the aforesaid deed, so to chea$t the rightful owner out of this tract of land. Thiit: he intended to do, by making it appear that he ha4d had dealings with his neighbor, by lendng him:. money, and then by taking said land for security on: the loan which had never been refunded. The son received much sympathy, but this proved, of little avail, in the present case of extremity. RHi perseeutor had laid and matured his plans artfully, and withal, possessed a plentiful supply of that: dra. s which often corrupts the heart of many an unprnci- pled person, so that they do not hesitate to rob irhei unprotected " widow and the fatherless;" of that which is their rightful due; nor would he shrink from reoeive-. ing a bribe in lieu of every honest principle. T'i youth, seemed doomed to be the victim of an ol4L. spite held- againt his deceased father. The case had twice been carried to court, and-op;e, had been partially decided:; Aud the land would: ti e  have fallen to the claimanLt But somethig, uswt, arose, when i, was decided to have a renewal of. twio - OQur- yong lawyer was not oficiating atS the Ur:.-;,  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7571-00000057"/> "4 this tiine, but happeied in town; when the first case was in session, and, after hearing reports of it from friends, he became interested, and attented every trial; though in disguise, for he wished to witness, unobservedly, thewhole proceedings.. So he listened to every word, with deep-rooted attention, weighing every fact in the just scales of his own mind; follow- ing the intricacies of the case with the fleet step of discernment, scanning every new feature as it presen- ted itself,--sifting, and weighing-occasionally pen- cilling down facts which he might possibly forget,: and which would come in play when he chose to study into and investigate the matter, as he was determined to see justice done. It was evident to our keen observer, that they were trying to dupe the poor victim. He had observed a flaw, and was greatly imtrprised that the presiding judge had omitted to discover wherein it lay. Young Hovert was soon among them; whether the young man had. remarked his superior talents, and sit'acity, or whether it was the work of friends, we; cannot say. Most assuredly he had found just the man for him, although, perhaps, it was somewhat late in the day. However," better late than never." Time will settle all preliminaries. Wallace Grey was permitted to choosy his own lawyer in the renewal Of the case. The car of Justice sometimes rolls along the stony pavements of life, making music  with her wheels. Ah! fools, would ye settle down and grin with fiendish joy over another's gold'? Ah! would ye? But' hark! another champion is- on the-field. What alofty mein! what a brow! Great- ness, and goodness, and genius, has set her seals upon , every lineament of his countenance. Lawyer Hovertr possessed a rare mind, form, and face. His high,s expansive brow seemed the very seat of intellect-   uality. Few, especially the guilty, could long with" stand the deep, penetrating gaze of black orbs. Rea- der, -do not infer from this - that this gentleman was always stern. Those fine sensibilities, which had so long characterized the line of Hoverts, were bestowed abundantly upon the present scion of the haughty, noble race. Goodness and greatness blended together, makes a heart large for action! I have spoken naught but truth, concerning the gentleman whom we have-had occasion to mention. We will suffice it to announce that the case was won! and -#hat, too, amid the deafening cheers and plaudits of the lovers of justice. When Malice is disarmed of his long secreted wea- pon, and the innocent go on their way rejoicing, feeling that there are, indeed, some sunny spots on this side of the river of Death, then does the poor, wayfaring heart leap with joy! The name of the youthful Lawyer Hovert was soon heralded upon the wings of fame.- But this was not sought by our young friend; though he, doubtless, like all of us, liked to be appreciated in a- quiet way. His proceedings had been instigated through pure, unpretentious motives. He had wit;-'- nessed the deep-plotted villainy of unprincipled men against an innocent, fatherless youth, and his heart had been enlisted on the side of the oppressed; Would that there were more like him! ,   O    I   , O  O   0 Doubtless the reader will remember a letter found upon Elisiner's table, on the: evening following the sorrowful day when little Dora Pyrorie was laid awar in the church-yard, to sleep among the fading flow'- erets, and falling leaves of Autumn., We are to speak of the mother's letter, wherein,  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7571-00000058"/> "6 after expressing the depths of her maternal love, she, speaks in doubtful terms of recovering her property; also of the uncle's inability of regainingthe rightful claims. She then speaks in the silent eloquence of a mother's heart, of her gifted son Lawrence; little dreaming of the bright career which was, even now, dawning upon the path of this beloved son. Meanwhile the good uncle in New York was watch- ing the movements of the unprincipled men, having a plan in operation to datch them in their own traps, assistedi y several legal friends. He also had a powerful co-operator in Lawrence, who was studying, weighing, and investigating matters relative to the lost property of his deceased father, which consisted of broad lands, with fine buildings thereon; also an excellent water privilege, and the beautiful home- stead of the Hovert family. Every proprietor who had resided here had sought how to embellish the appearance of this cherished old place; adding orna- mental beauties to its structure, or setting out choice trees and shrubs, until the residence was one of the- most beautiful on the banks of the flowing Hudson. This stream is narrower in some places. than others, It is not like many rivers, in their rapid, descending course, giving vent by rushing over large beds of rocks that seemed trying to impede its natural course. Doubtless this river was the one that Elisiner had reference to, in the lines that, suggested themselves. to her mind whilst watching by the sick bed of her cousin Amelia Pyrone, the night following her cousin Dora's death. Whilst Lawrence is providing. himself with just-: documents of defence for the recovery of his moth- ers, property, we will leave him; expecting! soon to see the young lion of Truth and Justice emerging, from his lair, in full strength, and well prepared to   "7 meet his opposing enemies. We leave,him in his: own room writing a letter to his friends at home. Now reader we will follow Byron Lenson to the. residence of Deacon Pyrone, when we will ascertain whether his sister accompanied him home, or re- mained over night with her friend Elisiner. We must not linger in appreciating or depreciating the many fluctuating sensations that this gentleman experienced at this time. We have no inclination to detract the lustre which has attached itself to his numerous characteristics. The evening passed pleasantly by all, except Byron and Elisiner; the former seeking every opportunity in the interval of conversation, for imparting the story of his sentiments for Elly's hearing. But the latter, not wishing to selfishy appropriate the wealth. of these well-defined ideas to herself, took them as common-place remarks intended to fill up the. chinks of conversation; but behaving in such a way that her-visitor could not take offence. In fact, Miss Ho- vert treated the brother of her friend Kate in every respect as she would a highly-respected acquaintance; often soliciting his advice on various subjects, where she thought his judgment superseded her, n. But affairs were not destined to remain long in this state. A jealous lover is not very well calculated to carry tranquilityinto the circle where he daily moves. Byron Lenson possessed feelings that would not bear trifling. From habit, these feelings were so deeply, impregnated within the forms of his resolutions, that a contradictory course would have been deemed almost too presumptive for counteraction. Notwithstanding all this, the good, affectionate Kate would often wind her slender arms around her brother's neck, and in earnest, child-like accents,  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7571-00000059"/> "8 expostulate with him to forego certain long-cherished plans. And not unfrequently would he yield to her sisterly solicitations. But here was a case wherein the soul of the young man was lost in a labyrinth of jealous conjectures. 'xHe was too proud to ask Kate if she possessed the fulTheart's confidence of her friend Elisiner; so he concluded to wait in gloomy, watchful silence. The snow was lying deep in the garden. Mrs. Clay's school was soon to close. A grand exhibition had longr been in contemplation, so the school was to close for the present, with the anticipated exhibition. Beautiful music lent its charms at the intervals between speaking. Kate and Elisiner were the two observed stars on the stage. . ' Byron Lenson, although not a member of this school, had received an invitation to take part at the entertainment. So he was equipped in full uniform, had a table placed-before him, and recited Cato's "Soliloquy On-the Soul," in a manner which im- pressed the audience with a full sense of his oratorial powers. On the Fourth of July following this exhi- bition he was, chosen to deliver an oration at the celebratiadt Elly was expecting soon to go home, to mingle 'once more in the pleasant, holy society of mother and sisters. Miss Amelia had returned from   Newhuryport *here she had been spending a few weeks with her friends, amongst whom she once- taught school.   CHAPTER VIII. Wintry frosts and snow appear, Autumn glows and woodlands drear- Revenge, wrapped in mantle white, Friendship and love, blended with spite. A heavy, hurried tread through the hall was the announcement to Willie that the postman had arrived with letters for the family. So he opened an oppo- :site door to the -one through which Mr. Griffin had -entered, and taking the letters, singled them out, giving them to their respective owners, with the exception of Elly's; he witheld her's, because, as he said, he wanted to see her smile and show her dim- ples when he showed them  to her, which he should do in a tantalizing manner, so that she would teaze for them. But Tlisiner was amply repaid for waiting, as the little rogue soon came round with a small parcel of 4letters, archly saying :- "Now, Cousin -illy, if you will give me just such a kiss as you bestowed upon  --- " hesitating, as he -held up the 'letters-" well, just such a one as you -gave that tall student, when you and he parted at the gate, I will give you these letters!" "I will give you a true, cousinly kiss, Willie, if that will do." Two of these letters were from New York, from  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7571-00000060"/> 120 kind friends, and one from the tall, handsome student whom Wilhe had referred to. He stated that in a few weeks more, he would be with her. The rest of this letter we do not feel jus- tified to peruse. That it breathed forth words of truth and love, we have no doubt. The fourth letter was from her excellent parent, enclosing one from her brother Lawrence, which had been sent to his mother from Philadelphia. It was a satisfactory one, written in such a style as few can adopt. The young lawyer had gotten possession of one of the deeds of a small tract of land; the one lying north of a branch of the river. The eastern portion of this land had been carefully cleared years before, and laid out in a peculiar style which reflected honor upon both the one who planned, and the one who laid out the place. Every kind of a fruit-tree, adapted to the climate, found a place within this enclosure. But we cannot dwell too long on the Eden-like residence of Colonel Hovert. Every one who has travelled through this part of the country cannot fail to admire the beautiful, picturesque scen- ery; though the humble writer prefers the high, green hills of Vermont, and still more, the heather wilds of Scotland. This night-the maiden Elisiner dreamed strange visions. She fancied that she was borne aloft on the strong wings of a singular bird. She next found herself in a deep valley, where there were many persons, sick and wounded, and some even were dying. Then there arose the pale, interesting countenance of a young man, whose right arm was in a shattered con- dition. In the shadow was an assassin, who crouched behind a tree. And now the scene changed.   121 The dreamer was in a bridal apartment.  The bride was there; her face was pale, and showed signs of emotion, which showed that her heart did not accompany her hand. The ceremony was performed. Her eyes were riveted upon the pale features of the bride, so that she had scarcely noticed the appearance of the bride-groom; her sleeping senses told her that it was Byron Lenson. Still farther along was Clarence Nervourn, looking white and care worn, and lying upon a low couch. Her heart sickened at the sight! She turned to leave the room, when she encountered the eyes of Byron Lenson. They wore a sinister look. She sprang forward to leave his presence, when he grasped her by her hands- to detain her. She screamed, and-awoke. Miss Amelia stood by the bed with a light, say- ing- "Come Elly, father and mother are to start for Vermont this morning, and you know that you and I must act in the capacity of helpers." And with a morning kiss, she left the room. Whilst preparing to descend to the lower rooms, Elisiner tried to fathom the depth of last nights dream. Could it be that this child was able to pene- trate beyond the veil of earth's future? We are sure that the instructive powers are classed with the marvelous founder of the great architectural struct- ure of the heart and brain. After her hasty morning toilet was over, this child of early virtue and piety bent low, and sent up a heart-felt supplication for the continued protection and guidance of her Heavenly Father. Thus was' her soul tranquilized. A voice, melodious as an angel's whisper, breathed these woids into the young girl's ear:- "  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7571-00000061"/> 122 "Child, go ye on! thy Father's hand will uphold thee!" Deacon Pyrone had a brother and several acquaint- ances in Vermont; " away up among the green hills." Thither, he and his wife were bound. The sleigh- ing was very fine; the atmosphere just cold enough to call into action-the blood of the old as well as the young. This old gentleman preferred his own team to the slower stage. In the town of--- lived old Isaac Warner, a connection of Capt. Warner's, one of Vermont's veterans, who took an active part in the struggling contest between Great Britain and "Young America." This gentleman, with the Car- penters, and Cooks, and one or two others, was among the first to uproot the tories, and lend his efficient aid in rooting out the nefarious plans of the would be murderers of their own blood; that is, those of near affinity to themselves. On this farm, was a clearing in the backwoods, a little to the north of a creek, where the beech-trees and maples clipped their leafy boughs in Summer-time and hillock after hil- lock rose far above. Some few years previous, when the red sons of Vermont infested this wilderness, a young daughter of Ephraim Burnett strolled away from her snug cabin home, with a younger brother, in search of a missing colt. After it was found, the girl, being swift of foot, told the lad to trot on ahead with the colt, and she would soon overtake 'him, after securing mQre of the red berries that grew near by. The boy hesitated and said- "c' ome, Nell, come home, or the Indians will be after you! I advise you to go with me." Blt the sister, not heeding this timely admonition, bade the boy to proceed homeward, and she would soon follow. Just at this moment the colt bounded forward over the uneven ground, with the rapidity   123 of a deer ; evidently frightened at something unseen by the children. Then came, a shrill, terrifying whoop-the Indians were near! The boy hastened home with the tidings, and the scattered settlers assembled before the door of the log cabin belonging to Mr. Burnell. They continued their search for several days; meantime the trail of the Indian was tracked down as far- as the Little Rock, when it was lost. Probably the girl, like hundreds of others, was taken captive. 8-   o            . g Q O A few mornings after the departure of the deacon and his wife, a ringing laugh was heard from with- out, and a merry exclamation from Willie. "-  Hurrah, Willie i" was shouted, in the well-known tones of Elbur Lenson. "Hurrah! Don't you know that Byron is going to be made very rich? Oh! you don't know how rich." "How do you know so much, Elbur?" W   hy, you goose! how do I know? Why, Uncle  Elwell has come clear across the great sea to see mother, and he says that if Byron will change his name, and take his, that he will have lots of money  and-and--" "What else? Come into the house and tell Elly about it " said Willie. "No, Byron will do that, himself, I guess," said Elbur, looking wondrous wise. Children will look wise occasionally, when they think they have learned something new. The boy Elbur was quite right in this statement. Mrs. Lenson's bachelor brother, a resident of proud England's soil, had lately returned to America, to find and assist his sister. He was the possessor of unbounded wealth, and, in early years had made a  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7571-00000062"/> 124 will. He had once doted greatly on his sister Hen, rietta, who was several years his junior. -TEaving no father, the brother thought that he was invested with full power to withold, or bestow his sister's hand on whom  he chose, without any reference to her heart. This gentleman designed to bestow the fair maiden's hand upon some proud aristocrat. These plans were known to the sister, but, prior to the dis- closure of his premeditated schemes, both hand and heart were given into theb keeping of her accepted lover, Orrian Lenson, a young merchant in The young people were united in marriage, and after some years of prosperity, the firm to which he belonged failed in business. The reader is acquaint- ed with the particulars of this failure, also of the death of Byron Lenson's father; also of the removal of the widow to the brown cottage in the lane. Whether from an innate sense of justice, or from some other cause, we are unable to say; but certainly, the rich old bachelor was at this sister's cottage, mak- -ing- proposals to the widow relative to her'son's becoming his heir; but he (the- nephew) must change his name, and take his uncle's, in order to become said heir. After some deliberation on the Lenson side, it was decided that, if there was no objections, Byron would accept his uncle's bounty, whenever he chose to bestow it, after the altering of names; which 'name Byron, for some unknown cause, did not wish to take until his twenty-third birth-day. There was a, fixed purpose within the heart of this stern man, which naught save the key of time. and circumstances would divulge. Truly a magnificent winter's sun was throwing its descending beams aslant the old brown tower of an isolated building which stood on an hilly elevation, nearly north of the widow's cottage. This structure   125 was erected in New Hampshire's earliest infancy, It served as a fort during the early part of the strug- gle between the red skins of the wilderness, and the hardy sons of the state. After the Revolution, and   independence was declared, it was used as a hospital for small pox, for a few patients who took sides with the British. After contending with the hardy boys of- the Granite State, five of their number fought with the hateful malady of small pox. This building was used only a few days for this purpose. For many years after, rats and mice held undisputed sway throughout the old mansion. Finally a man by the name of Wi-l son opened a tavern here for wayfaring people. Many loaded teams stopped over night here. By: and by, a man who had been to R------with a load of hops, tarried on his way home, at this inn."  As he was never heard from afterwards, it was supposed that he had been foully dealt with by the people at the inn. The tavern keeper soon removed to Canada. Supernatural sounds have since been heard in and about this old inn, and though little credence should be given to such vagaries, yet several families were obliged to remove from that vicinity, on account thereof. To this old fort, did the brother of Widow Lensona repair, on the mornin-g following the conversation held between himself, nephew, and    sister. The uncle stopped at Mrs. Lenson's; but day after day, through the depths of the snow, did he wend his solitary way to this old,- haunted inn; for what pur- pose, the family were unable to decide, though the- widow, well knowing the natural eccentricity of -her g Many-years ago, this antiquated building was burned to the. ground, and a- thriving New England farmer, by the name of Sherford, now residesin thi locality, in a snug-hous-e  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7571-00000063"/> 126 brother, passed this by as one of his peculiarities, Suffice it to say, that within two weeks, the bachelor ookl his departure from the little- brown cottage, No preliminaries were settled relative to Byron's receiving the uncle's name and property. This gen- tleman, having heard much of Lawrence Hovert, from his sister's family; and of-the unusual success of this young barrister, was quite anxious to see him. Quite frequently did he seat himself by the side of Elisiner, who visited the family several times during his stay, having been solicited to do so by Kate and her mother. A few days previous to the departure of this Eng- lish gentleman, Elly had spent an hour with the Lenson family and was aboFt to leave, when she was detained by said gentleman, who, in a hurried man- ner, thrust into her hands a small parcel. Then with a hasty 6" good night" he recrossed the entry on the way to his own room. -Miss Amelia was about to retire when Elly arrived at home ; having suffered much during the fore part of the evening with a headache. Not wishing to disturb her cousin, Elly repaired to an inner cham- ber. Here she found ample time to examine the contents of the small parcel, received from Major Elwell. There was a handsomely penned note, in which the writer thanked her for her great kindness to him, a stranger. Or, as be expresses himself:-  XMiss PYRONE: Never will the humbole- writer of this cease to remember your timely interference in my behalf. I shall Snot, and perhaps need not, refer to time or place where I have met you. Your own good heart will sweetly reward you for your noble actions. You will hear from me again, ere long; though   127 soon the broad Atlantic will roll between us. I am, to accompany Major Elwell, as his servant, and this gentleman's destination is England; Please accept this ring as a trifling tribute for your kindness. Long did the maid ponder upon this singular epistle. Whom  could this individual be, who con- ferred such favors upon herself I She sat a few moments, apparently buried in deep thought. Then suddenly clapping her hands, she exclaimed:- "Can it be him . It is true, indeed. I evaded the officer's direct questions, and I prayed inwardly that he might escape, thinking then, as I have ever since, that innocence was stamped indelibly upon every lineament of his face." Elisiner felt the freedom of a released bird and her soaring wings of light and love were not clipped by the freezing atmosphere of her Aunt Pyrone's scowling countenance, as this lady was now visiting in Vermont. Since little Dora's death, Elisiner had felt as though the sweetest bud from the treasured rose-tree in the inner sanctuary of her heart, had} fallen, and been borne away to heaven. But Oh t the sweet perfume was undying. The memory of this budding flower was a dear solace fn the lonely hours of night, for the half-orphaned Elisiner. Nev- er- since had she visited the- garret, without a tear's bedewing her eye, at the meniory of some of the simple, childlike remarks of the lost one, upon find- ing some quaint, old-fashioned article, which particu- larly attracted her notice. And how often had the little one bounded over the creaking boards with some newly-found treasure, which she wished to shotv Q Cousin Elly. And quite frequently* would she throw her little arms about her neck, bidding her not to cry because mamma was so cross w Then, as if her  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7571-00000064"/> 128 Iatfual instincts guided her, she would attempt to deter her cousin from dwelling on painful reflections, by asking questions, or responding merrily to those asked her. No wonder that there was a lonely spot in Elly's heart. But the maid was thrice happy in believing that Dora's angel spirit was now a beautiful gem in a richly made crown of glory, in the inner courts above! One morning, previous to the leave-taking of Major Elwell, Elbur Lenson was despatched to the mansion, with a note from his sister, saying that she (Kate) would spend the next afternoon with Elisiner. Elbur stood by, whilst Elly perused the lines of the billet; and as she finished, she turned to the desk to scribble a few lines in reply, although, in reality, it needed none, though a few loving words from her would be gladly welcomed by her friend Kate. "Here, Elbur child, what are you thinking of? The letter is ready." Then seeing that the question was unheeded by the child, Elly stood watching the varied fluctuations of his interesting countenance, for a moment or more. Then the child looked up, whilst a tear glistened in 4his eye, as he said, slowly, thoughtful- ly:-- "Miss Elly, these pretty house plants of yours make me feel sad." "Why so, my dear little friend Elbur '? The tears still glistened in the boy's eyes, as he replied-- "From those very plants you took buds and flow, ers to place in little Dora's -hands, and among her curls, when she lay in her little coffin." Here the little mourner's voice became tremulous; for indeed, little Elbur Lenson, young as -he was, and   *   129 as merry as he was by nature,wabnaeas a sincere mourner. He had given his sister's billet into the possession of Miss. Hovert, when the plants in -the bay-window brought rather forcibly to his mind the death and burial of little Dora. "Yes, in her little coffin!" he continued sadly. "And when Spring comes, I will plant a rose-tree by the white marble slab where Dora is sleeping. May I not, Miss Elly?" The young head of Elbur was lying near the heart of Elisiner, before the question was responded to. "' My dear little friend Elbur, our precious Dora is a beautiful angel in heaven! You and the little lost one were happy friends." "Yet you know, Miss Elly, how you and Kate smiled when I called Dora my little fairy. She once gave me one of her little books; and then after she was so sick, and grew so very pale, she gave me her pet lamb, laying that she should never play with it any more. Miss Elly, did you say that little Dora is an angel now? Yes, I think it must be so, for she was such a good child, and loved to speak of the good people that we read about in that little book." "Do you remember that picture of Christ, when he was a babe, in that little book which Dora gave you?" "' Oh yes, Miss Elly, that was her favourite picture. But are the angels in heaven like those on earth?" "I fear that there are few such angelic persons in this wicked world," answered Elisiner. "But somebody said that you, Miss Elly, was a beautiful, earthly angel, and-" "And what?" said a voice from behind. "Yes, I say so now! yes, even more beautiful and orient than the stars."  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7571-00000065"/> ^130   . Both Elisiner and the child started at the sound of this voice; when Elly met the smiling gaze of-- Byron Lenson. He stood just outside the  door,   which communicated with the room, in which the above conversation had taken place. He apologized for his sudden appearance, saying that he. was not an intentional eaves-dropper, but that he had just passed into the hall, and had- heard Elbur's last words. He then added that he presumed that Elbur had delivered Kate's message. Elisiner replied that he had; and Byron continued:- "I am sorry to disappoint you, Miss Hovert, but since Elbur has left home, my mother and sister have received word that the invalid Frenchwoman is worse, and wishes to see them to day. They cannot go until afternoon as my uncle leaves at ten this morn- ing." '"I thank you, Mr. Lenson, foryour kindness in calling." "Oh! here is my sister's billet in my pocket." Elly received it from his hand. "But first, Miss Hovert, I will say that business Calls me into town this afternoon, and if you have any errands thence, I will most cheerfully execute them." "Thank you; yes, we have some letters-or rather, shall have some to-morrowto send to the city." (' Very well, Miss Hovert, my business to the city can be deferred until to-morrow with no immediate concern to myself. And, " he continued," the pleas- ure that .it will afford me to do you a service, will amply compensate for anything on my part, however momentous it may be." But for the impassioned tone of his voice, and the light of love which stole -over his fine countenance, Elisiner mnight have maintained her usual control.'   131 Meanwhile, Wilhe had entered the room; very quietly, however, until he beheld Elbur, then he became quite uproarious in his glee. A look from the latter, however (who had been an-attentive listen- er to the conversation between Miss Elisiner and his brother,) checked his noisy mirth, for a short time, though his mind was bent upon the contemplated coasting and skating expedition. X Come," Elbur, come!" he exclaimed. , Don't stand there, staring so at Miss Elly and your brother. You look, for all the world, like a picture in my comic almanac; mouth and ears wide open, catching, and' swallowing every word, as a starved raccoon, would swallow something immensely good." So these two juveniles ran out in the direction of a little lakelet, whose even, glossy surface, vied in brightness with the finest mirror. Old Tiger and little Snuffer ran at- their heels. The boys were laughing and running along, in merry glee, tossing their highly-polished skates over their heads. The skater's song reverberated around the snow-capped hills, long after the merry group had disappeared, winding around the curve in the road--through the leafless woods, down to the destined spot of amuse- ment, where, in waiting, were two rosy-cheeked play- fellows, duly equipped for coasting and skating. But all this childish glee had passed unheeded by Byron Lenson; the fun of the boys was all lost on his ear. His soul was actively alive to the fulfil- ment of his long-meditated hope of success; that of winning the hand of Elisinert Hovert. Then, in that still, quiet apartment, where no sound was heard save the ticking of the long mahog- any clock, and, occasionally, the crackling of the burning wood in the fire-place,--then did all the vehemency of a long pent up fountain  of love,  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7571-00000066"/> 1-32 light its fire in the dark eyes of the young man; the fountain was unsealed-the flood-gates of his heart loosened, and the stream of adoring, unfalter- ing, unwavering love was poured forth into the ear of the object who had caused its concentration, and overflowing. Yes, the proud, aristocratic Byron Len. son had bent low at the shrine of innocence, worth and beauty! Then, in the interval, Elisiner responded:- "Impossible! Mr Lenson, I am sorry that you have bestowed your affections upon an unworthy sub- ject, as it is perhaps unnecessary for me to say that p    I cannot return them, by a stream of reciprocated sentiment." May I ask- why?" inquired the youth, clasping her hand more clousy within his own. "Why not, Elisiner? Can you doubt my sincerity and love? Do you deem the words that I have uttered idle? words proceeding from the brain, instead of from the heart's o'erflowing fountain?" "Do not take offence, Hr. Lenson, when I say that my affections had received prior claims, long--even years before I over saw you, or-" Before she had completed her sentence, the young man arose\ to his feet, and with an entire change in his countenance, said:- "Lady, you are much mistaken if you think that I wish to usurp another's claims." Now these last words, which fell from the lips of Byron Lenson, -were false-false! He did mean to usurp the possessor of- Elisiner's heart,f root and branch, if he could! It only occupied a moment's time for him to decide upon his after course. His will was an iron one; no bend--no-break. "Mays I ask you -one question, Miss Hovert?" { Certainly, sir, if it proves a consistent one." , s   133 "I should ask you no other," was the tart rejoin- der. "When was your accepted lover here last?' "Last fall." "Last fall," repeated Byron, musingly. I was absent from the cottage some weeks last fall, " believe. May I ask his name-?" The maiden was silent; apparently spell-bound, by so sudden a change in the appearance of her suitor. "Well, well, Miss Hovert, do not trouble yourself to try to recall far-off ames!" said Byron, ironically. Elisiner,. looking him calmly in the face, said:--  I hope, Byron, that I shall always deserve the love and esteem of my respective friends?" "uThere is no veil so thick but. that the eye of jealous love can penetrate beyond its fabrie." This last sentence was spoken in a low tone. "I hope that there is no person who stands in this light towards myself?" No reply was made. The silence became painful. Finally, Byron broke the spell, by saying:- "Then you -can give me no hope of ever winning your love, or esteem?"  "Oh, sir, you have my warmest esteem now, for the sake of your excellent mother, and my dear, amiable friend Kitty."  "All this may be true, but such esteem cannot cancel love like mine," said the young man, in a sad undertone. Footsteps were heard advancing through the long dining room, and as Miss Amelia entered by one door, Mr. Lenson, with a low-" good morning," and a respectful bow, left by an opposite door. Not even the raw, cold winds direct from the snow- capped hills, could, in the least, cool the fevered brow of this young man. Myriads of snow-birds 12  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7571-00000067"/> 184 flitted before him; but in vain, for his attention could not be aroused. The woodman's axe, plying heavy plows to the trunk of the sturdy oak, near by, failed to awaken one thought within the young man's breast. On- he went, through the snow-paths, until the ring of sleigh-bells, in the direction of his moth- er's cottage, aroused him from his unpleasant dreams. It was Major Elwell, on his way to meet the stage. "Ia]lo! Byron, now bid your old uncle good- bye!V  The young man leaped over a hedge into the road, and was soon standing by the sleigh.- They shook' hands, and the uncle passed on. The nephew soon found himself at home, in the solitude of his own chamber, holding communion with his own soul. What his thoughts were, time will show. ,      .  *           ,    -  .   CHAPTER IX. 1"One chain connects the mighty whole. - m   A little streamlet stole slyly from its parent's siie, winding its way along for about a mile through a valley (called the Hunter's vale,) where a bed of rocks reposed; then dashing down, one little wave hurrying past the other like race-horses, away-away to the foot of the descent, where, narrowing, it winds round among hills, linked together like a chain, until after another chase for a short distance, thistruant child of the beautiful river loses itself in the bosom of the mountaip.  A few rods from the rise of this frolicsome riverlet, was a small hut, nestled cosily between the twin hillas.* In former years, when the struggling forces of New Hampshire and Vermont had assembled, and with one heart andhand (except the Ibry band,) marched to meet, and oppose the British, or to die in the attempt, a spirited, patriotic man, by the name of Leighton, sought refuge, with his daughter, in the thickly- !   wooded ravines of Vermont. Not that Leighton was a coward, did he hide himself away from the boldly- confronting Red-coats; no, for his was a brave spirit, and even at home, with his wounded arm, and mother-  Reader, we have gone back in our history, to a period much in advance of that when our story commences.  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7571-00000068"/> 136 less child, had he made many a skulking Indian bite the dust. Andhe had rendered efficient aid to the handful of noble spirited men, who had gathered themselves together to consider upon their furthering of their well concocted plans in lrgard to meeting their foes, and protecting their families and property. Mr. Leighton had a distant relative in ,with whom he thought to place his darling daughter, Man- dolina. This premeditated separation was a sad topic to dwell upon, for a long time. So taking the beau- tiful girl, they broke their way through the dense wil- derness, the passage often rough and mountainous, until, from sheer exhaustion, they were obliged to halt between the two hills to which we have alluded; and along whose base, ran the dancing little fugitive of the Merrimac. Night approached, and the fast-gathering shadows from the wooded summits, only served to lay more sombre shadows upon the heart of the father. Stop- ping for a few moments, to give respite: o his weary limbs, he sought to relieve his perturbed mind, by analyzing each respective thought, and then to select the one best calculated to form into a plan; and one, too, which would suit the the present emergency. In trying dilemmas, the mind and hands often resort to expedients from which they would shrink, in less trying times. This hardy mountaineer had but one transient thought concerning himself, but the welfare, and even the life of his daughter -was at stake. Reader, we little know of the impending sorrows of those brave hearts, who lived and toiled, and not unfrequently bled and died, to gain that independence which we now, as untrammelled subjects, enjoy. Shortly after this, a scouting party was sent on the alert, for the purpose of obtaining as many facts   137 as possible, concerning the movements of the Tory party, also to detect the British spies, if there were any. Whilst on this expedition, the scouts fell in with Mr. Leighton. With the united efforts of this gentleman and his friends; a rude log hut was con- structed for the temporary abode of himself and child. This hut was so sheltered in its locality by the hills, that no ordinary eye could detect its whereabouts. Leighton's fair daughter was wont to bathe her round face, and agile limbs in this little streamlet. This bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked Mandolina, of the Green Mountains, was destined to act a conspicuous part in the struggle for independence. In the year the pleasant home of this young girl became almost extinct. Its substitute was "Angel Dew- drop;" given thus, no doubt, by the friends of liberty, in consideration of the many services that she per- formed for them and her country. Perhaps no one individual rendered greater assist- ance to the Republican cause, in these perplexing times, than the brave, noble Leighton; and certainly, no fairer hand dressed a wound, prepared a whole- some meal for a hungry, toil-worn soldier; that no American woman ever received more heart-felt grati- tude, than did this same Angel Dewdrop, for her unwearied kindness to the brave soldiers of those days. No practiced hunter could clean, load, or dis- charge a rifle more scientifically than this maid of the Twin Hills. At one time Leighton was taveling alone through the woods,bound for the American camp, having impor- tant news to communicate, when he was saluted with the dismal howl of a wolf. At this time, a friendly, gratuitous, service like this, implanted a feeling of reverence amouting to love, within the hearts of these hardy sons of the Green Mountain, and the  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7571-00000069"/> 138 sister state, New fHampshire. A short time after this, the father was at home again, fairly prostrated with the breaking out of the wound on his arm. About this time, the daughter had left the log cabin to per- form her mission of love for the soldiers. Leighton was out with his fishing implements, when he suddenly came upon a party of Tories and Indians, who appeared to be engaged in earnest conversation. Of course his trusty rifle was his companion, for not only Tories and Indians were prowling about, but wolves and other animals. Leighton had no idea of retreating; indeed, he was rather pleased that he had happened upon this party, as he suspected that there was "mischief in the wind." Carefully settling his body on the earth, he crept stealthily along, until he found himself in a position where he could listen, but not be seen. To his chagrin he beheld one man among the Tories, a deserter from their own band, the sight of whom caused the hot blood to boil in his freedom-loving veins. This person had been selected by the Tories to act in the capacity of spy; he was detailed to ferret out the secluded home of Leighton. It was agreed upon that this spy should repair, every day at sun- down, to the Three stumps,o and there he would be met by a Tory scout, to whom he must report. Leighton could scarcely control his indignation as he heard the traitor's responses. However, it was not prudent for him to give vent to angry invectives. But the wretch deserved execration from every lover of the country's rights. Soon after, Leighton threaded his way back to the cabin, where his daughter was impatiently awaiting o A place where three stumps of trees were situated; their tops having been blown off by high winds sweepimg through the forest. One of these: stumps was hollow, and within it an American officer was known to have taken refuge from two of his own bro- thers, who were Tories.   139 his return. The sun was setting in the West when Leighton observed to the Angel Dewdrop, that he wished to go out into the forest for a short time, on a reconnoitering expedition. He had already com- municated his day's adventure to his child. Y"Yes, father," responded the daughter " but remem- ber that I start for the American camp, by the first dawn of daylight, and you know that we have much to talk about meantime." "Yes, my brave Mandolina, but I cannot consent to your traveling unprotected in these woods, hereafter." "Why not, father? something must be done immed- iately in order to frustrate these designs of the Tories t" "Yes, my brave girl I that is too true. But my arm feels much better since you applied that new lin- iment which you prepared, so I shall go myself, and you must remain within close quarters." *   And the father disappeared. But his pale face, and nerveless arm, troubled the girl for some hours after his departure. The pain that he suffered from this wound, sometimes gave rise to sad, maddening forbod- ings in the young girl's mind, that he, one of the best father's, would soon leave this world of care, and that she would be left alone. The Angel Dewdrop retired to her rustic apart. ment, and there, with clasped hands, petitioned hea- ven to watch over her dear father, and to help the right cause. We will now follow Leighton in his ramble. He did not go far from the cabin, as his main object for leaving the hut, was to mislead the disguised Tory, should he fall in with him, as he felt a strong presen- timent that he should. The daughter's fate rose and fell with every footfall of the parent's as he moved onward. He turned to enter the cabin, when he suddenly halted; not to lis-  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7571-00000070"/> "O ten to any uncommon sound, but to consider in his own mind what it was best for him to do in the present case. It was hazardous, he knew, for his daughter to make so many journeys through the lonely forest; (  and what could he do, with his wounded arm? He feared illness; already, he felt the fire of fever in his veins. The light of an almost divine meteor shone through his soul. He dropped upon his knees, and there in the dark, and almost impenetrable thickets, sent up a prayer to the footstool of the Infinite Jeho- vah, who rules alike over heaven and earth. The prayers of father and daughter were blended, doubtless, in one stream of holy confidence and trust. Scarcely had the last words of devotion died upon his lips,ere he was aware that his movements were watched by other eyes that those from heaven. "Hills! if there aint my friend Wilford Leighton," , said the man, at the same time walking forward to meet Leighton, with extended hand. It was difficult for the latter to withhold the con- tempt that he felt for this person. "But how came you here in the-depths of these woods in the- territory of the twin hills, and at this hour of night?" inquired Leighton. 4 Why nothing in particular, only to find you, and other good friends, who are doing so much for the good cause, sir."' Before giving his victim time to respond, he pointed to the little cabin, which he had just discerned through the waving foliage of the trees. Leighton thought at first that it would be best to maintain a dignified contour; but a moment's reflec- tion taught himt otherwise. The purple and golden drapery of the western sky proclaimed that the garb of day was fast sinking    away, and that, ere long, the sober shades of night would settle over forest and mountain. l I have many things to entrust in your case, my good friend Leighton," said the arch traitor. "Indeed! have you?"What can they be?" he asked; adding :--"Maybe the news from York." "Yes, yes," hesitated the scoundrel. "Old Hovert has been unanimously selected as captain of a band of Yorkers, amounting to about a hundred or so. He will soon be ready to 'co-operate with the others." Now this statement was true, as Leighton was glad to hear. But what could be the traitor's object in imparting such a bit of intelligence? "Well, how does this movement affect you?" enquir- ed Leighton, rather sternly. "Does it meet with a true response in your heart?" These last words had a depth of meaning in them. "Oh yes, indeed," stammered the base deceiver. "Well, come now," said the host," let's have some supper," softening so greatly, that his manner seemed quite bland. Leighton detested hypocrisy, but he had a service to perform for his own outraged party. Leighton's vision was no dupe to the artifice of the man with whom he had to deal. He knew that the villian supposed that he had got him safely in his clutches, and so he should run no risk in informing him of the news of the Republican movements. "Supper? Yes, supper will be all the better taken in your good company. Why, Leighton, Ive been hunting for you this many a week, now and then, you know, when I had time," and the hateful Judas rubbed his hands together with fiendish joy. "But Leighton," he added, "I see that you are here in your hermitage alone. How do you manage to get along with your cooking?"  f  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7571-00000071"/> "2 )    "OLil, as well as circumstances will admit of," an- swered the host. "By the way, I suppose that pretty daughter of yours is stowed away up in New Hampshire, with that prudish aunt of her's, isn't she?" Before the sentence was completed, the traitor had disappeared. "My father---my father!" He appeared ' as if in a swoon from loss of blood. The wound had broken out afiesh. The maiden threw water into his face; but still no signs of returning consciousness. Not a moment was to be wasted. She tore the kerchief from her own neck, dipped it in cold water,-and bound it around the wounded arm; then dashed more water into her father's face. She now drew a cord from off a nail that was driven into the logs, and tied the hands and feet of the pros- trate wretch. The faint gleam of the lantern told a fearful story. The features of the man were black- ened by partial strangulation. This was terrible ' work for the small hands, and gentle nature of the heroic girl. The cord was then loosened from his neck, and made fast to the trunk of a tree. The other end was taken entirely from the man's neck, and made fast around his body. She now left him to his fate, and reflections ; should he ever be capable of attaining that state of consciousness. Now the child is kneeling by the side of her sire. He opens his eyes, and looks around. "Thank God! imy child is here 1" "Yes, my own dear father, I am here, safe and free from harm." "Where-where-" Oh, -father! the fellow is out yonder, secured by strong cords, doing no harm to himself or anybody else. No, not dead," added the maid, quickly perceiv- ing the father's fears.   P  -            i43 A cordial was administered, a-new bandage and lin- iment applied to the wounded arm, and Leighton, assisted by the Angel Dewdrop, was soon resting upon his rude couch, in deep sleep. Surely, an angel's form bent o'er him! Young maidens of the present day:-What would you think of changing your pleasant sitting-rooms, your music, or your last new books, for the rude log cabin, with a tory ruffian bound on your very thresh- old, a wounded father to care for, in a dark forest, surrounded by mountains, whilst ever and anon the distant howling of wolves would greet your ear; and paramount to all, the fear of a foe's stealing into the very heart of the state where every spot is dear to you! The breaking of dawn was very welcome to the inhabitants of the Twin Hills. The protracted slum- bers of Leighton restored him to his usual health: though the daughter begged to be entrusted with the message to the American camp. "To, my child! may the star of protection rest o,er thee!"    d The journey usually took up a day and a half. It is not our purpose to give a history of Mandolina Leighton's life, though, doubtless, it would be an interesting one. She returned from the camp escorted by an Amer- ican scout. The traitor was obliged to return with this scout to the camp, where he received due punish- ment. Nearly a century,4has passed since this act was per- formed by the maiden of the Twin Hills. After the Declaration of Independence, the Angel Dewdrop married a young  American officer, when they removed to New York, and if now living she must be a very venerable lady,  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7571-00000072"/> "4 We will only pause for a moment where plays the truant streamlet of the Merrimac around the base of the sloping green bank, leading to the log cabin. Wilford Leighton's successor was a younger brother, who, after the elder brother's removal to New York, chose this hilly retreat for his future asylum. Disap- pointment in early life made him prefer a hermetical life to one amid the tumultuous throng of the world.   CHAPTER X. Fear nob! we will yet find a smile beneath That frown- Towards noon, on the twenty-third day of January, a small inn was visited by three travelers. Thq edest gentleman appeared to be of English origin of somewhat portly propor tions. The second, atall, pale individual (that isi', as much of his countenance 'as was visible,) acted in the capacity of servant, After partaking of refreshment, they turned inta a small apartment. The Englishman retired toa a' remote corner of this room, and was soon busfily engaged in conversation on the subject of law, with the other gentleman. After a half hour spent in this way, the Englishman, who was having his snw,- shoes fastened upon his feet by the servant, spoke A few lol words to the latter, and departed. The other gentleman then commenced looking over some paperus taken from a rude portfolio, and the servant fell asleep, nicely covered in his shaggy overcoat. Now reader, we will follow on after the travelert Who is not an entire stranger to all of us; but will, if we are not mistaken, prove to be Major Elwell. The winds are blowing keen and cold, the sun ia visible, but appears to be dozing in hhs csrivotof fire. 13  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7571-00000073"/> "6 There goes our friend, turning around that corner where stands a clump of evergreens. He seems bound in the direction of the Twin Hills, where stands the log cabin of Andrew Leighton, the youngest brother of our old friend Wilford Leighton. It is not polite, neither is it right, nor just, to pry into the business of others;- but as the reader and I are out on a cold tramp, we have a peculiar interest in this little cabin, as it was once the abode of the Angel Dewdrop .and having seen her beautiful countenance lighting- the rustic apartments of her father's hut; and more tihan all, because this heroic maid was the great cousin of Elisiner Hovert, the heroine of our story.    , But reader, we have lingered  too long. Our curiosity has been foiled by our own tardiness. Our traveler has accomplished his errand, whatever it may be, and is now returning to the inn from whence he started. After a hasty breakfast next morning, they settled their bills with the host, and took their leave; the two gentlemen setting out nearly an hour previous to the departure of the servant, Jonas. It was nearly noon ere they left the cabin of Andrew Leighton; winding their way over trackless snows, then leaving the mountainous district, and steering towards the Connecticut river. Here they stopped at a farm- house for refreshments, and to hire some person to carry them to meet the stage. For no-nook or corner, in these/,days, bore the burden of a-rail-way track. The major's destination was Philadelphia, where he had important business with a certain young barrister, "a man of just renown." We must, for the present, take leave of our friend, the major. By and by he, with others, will again appear in our-pages. ;            S   "7 On the wings of privileged friendship, we will take our flight backwards, over mountains covered with virgin moss, and in our light soaring, cast a glance to where the ice-bound Hudson reposes beneath her armor of glass. We have also a view of the Connecticut, and many a noble, ice-bound stream. There are a few ferocious wolves now; but they are as nothing compared to those when Dewdrop carried the impor- tant documents, which were arrested from the traitor's pocket, to the American encampment. We reach the little log cabin ; the hermit is gone to his traps, and we find the pale stranger gentleman who is sitting alone and thus soliloquizing:- "Little did I think when a boy, stowed away on my father's farm, that when I had mounted the car of manhood, I should be borne beyond its soul-loved boundaries, becoming a plaything for the wings of chance. But 'man's destiny ismnot in his own hands."' The wheels of fate, by an unseen hand, are often turned from the anticipated road of enterprise and opulence, to a forest of multitudinous perplexities and anxieties. My future usefulness and happiness is, I fear, totally shipwrecked." Here the unhappy man buried his pale face within j his hands, and sighed heavily. It was plain that a fearful struggle was going on within. ; '4"God knoweth that this hand was never stained with I g   the blood of human being. No, never. The deed was perpetrated, but not by me. I was unconscious of the murder until it was accomplished. What motive actuated this newly acquired friend to act the foul part of assassin, is unknown to me. On the banks of the Connecticut, the earth, in green Summer time, drank the blood of a stranger; and for this murdered 6stranger, I, byan unjust court, am condemned to die!

Something whis- pers ,no,' No hangman's cord shall coil itself about my neck, whilst-this soul, which God has placed within this casket, occupies its earthly tenement." Many long years had rolled over the twin hills, but never, either when old Winter passed with his 4age face, enveloped in clouds of snow, or his fingers tipped with crystallized icicles, or when the mountain rose shed its perfume around the lonely hut, cheering the hearts of its lonely inhabitant; at no period had the unplastered walls of this humble cot contained such overpowering weight of sorrow, as crushed the heart of the present occupant. His earthly sun seemed draped in midnight darkness. But the soul of the fugitive brightened; radiant drops fell upon the trou- bled. heart, from the bubbling fountains of his soul. The scene continues to brighten! The genial coun- tenance, as that of an angel, appears in the back ground of the picture; but ere long she advances Sympathy and heavenly kindness beaming from her dark orbs on the fugitive. It is not until-the beauti- ful vision is standing by his side that he recognizes her. On her hand he beholds a well known ring. The misty veil falls from his clouded vision, and in the s fair being before him he sees the maiden who once saved him from his pursuers. The same finger which honored him by wearing his ring, was the one which once pointed out the sick woman's cottage, to the offi- cer who was questioning her in regard to her meeting any one on the road. Yes, reader, this beautiful vision assumed the form and appearance of Elisiner Hovert. No wonder that our wandering friend considered this half-orphaned maid as the savior of his life. Certainly she acted in the capacity of a friend to victimized   "9 Ihumanity, suffering from the effects of circumstantial evidence. The man became powerfully agitated. Half start- ing from his chair, his face as white as a ghost's, he, exclaimed :-  "My God! can it be possible? Can it be--- my-----" -   '- He suddenly checked himself. Then a cloud of perplexing doubts tugged at his heart strings; but. then arose the same, countenance,. the same darki. searching, yet loving eyes, the same compassionatew tone of voice, actuated by pity drawn from the same-, pure fountain. ', But' then, her name- is Pyrone --  Elisiffer Pyrone.- She was, called: by that name at the Lensou cottage. My heart and brain must- have misled me, I fear my reason is on the eve of its departure." A small portfolio was lying upon tie rude tablei before him. A few of his papers- were depositedu therein. He drew it- twards-- him, taking friom the interior a bunch of papers on one of which .was copiedc an unfinished; poem, penned by a friend of the major's niece, Kitty Lenson, who presented it to him whilst he was hidden at the old garrison, on thee hill near the little brown cottawge. There was.-no. name attache to this-; poem, but it had, with others beguiled many a. solitaryr houri whilst he was secreted within the old fort. He well8 remembered the' impression that the style of hand-; writing, as well as', poem, had left upon his mind at- that time. The, paper was now restored to the place:r from whencewhe had .taken;it'. He: again restedhis. head upon the table, and uttered a few sad words. N"Pbo brotieri Bernard i:e-!

But Oh!; how, in after years, did this brother injure me. And his wife-- where-Oh! where is she? Where is my once adored Laura?" -   ^    As this last sentence was concluded, a groan was sent up-from the' depths of the man's .heart. Then a profound silence prevailed. So deeply was the poor fugitive sunken in his sad reverie, that he heard not the heavy footfall of his companion, the hermit trapper. - He was finally aroused, however, by receiv- ing a tap on his shoulder. " Hallo! my friend," cried the cheery trapper. "Why if I had an urchin who did not pay more attention to my commands than you do, I'd turn him out into the woods to scrape acquaintance with the. black imps of the mountain cliffs, or with the jack- anapes of the swamps." "I wish," said his guest, " that I might be as free from the malice of men as your forest ompanions." "Come man! throw your fears to the four winds of heaven!" "Heaven! heaven!" repeated the sorrow-stricken guest. "Heaven showers none of its favors upon me." -"Hush! accuse not high heaven. Heaven is pure, but man is Vile.- Your case is not a desperate one. Have patience iny friend, for you are-innocent of the charge alledged against you, and-divine assistance will be given you, and peace will eventually be yours. 'Cry unto the Lord, and he will hear thee ' " "I will make an effort to dispel my fears, and appear calm." Yes,. yes, you talk likeo yourself, now, and you are looking-more natural; something like the days of 'auld lang syne' when you Fnd Hwent to Otter   Creek%- Come, help me dress this chap of the Green Mountains, for I am   tormentedly hungry.  I have fasted ever since the sun rose from behind that huge lump of snow. Conoe man! I defy all the blood-hounds of the North or South to ferret you out here.   It would be sorry work for two or three of those unjust emissaries to molest me!" "I humbly pray God to send good angels to guide and direct my heart and feet in the path of unerring safety." "Amen!" 'responded the good hermit. We have noticed that this hermit has asserted that no blood-hound in human form   could ferret out this hiding-place of his guest. It is needless for him to think that there is a place so remote that a vindica- tive foe will not find it; especially when the object' is- held in view as having committed a malicious mur-  der. 'It is true that the hermitage was very securely- located in a dense forest, and protected by a friendly mountain. Reader, we will linger but a few moments longer in the vicinity of the Twin Hills, when we will bid the scene with its hermit master, a final farewell. We have other dear friends to look after at the Pyrone Mansion, in the "Old Granite State," "Where the hills are so lofty, Magnificent and great." In the earlier days of the elder Leighton's sojourn among the mountain cliffs, he discovered a huge rock. only a few yards from his cabin, with an aperture on Some years before, these individuals had met, and a friendship had sprung up between them, -which, in later years, had become nearly extinct. But it was cordially renewed at the time of Major Elwell's visit to America, when he advised our persecuted', friend to secrete ;himself with thei hermit at the twin hills, as at this period, the forests thereabouts were very dense.  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7571-00000076"/> 152 the outside. He paid but little heed to it until one day, left to his own meditations, his daughter being busy within her own little apartment, his thoughts naturally rested upon the fate of his country, and his motherless child; the latter ever dearer to his soul than his own life. He suffered much. in contem- plating his own death, providing it should occur pre- vious to his daughter's. The fond parent knew that his child possessed a brave heart, and would not shrink from duty let it present itself in an easy, or painful form. The father had strong reasons to believe that his death would occur, ere long, caused by the cruel wound which he had received, some few years before, in- his right arm. The hostilities of war are always terrifying to the hearts of people; or, there may be some exceptions, as- some people like embroilments. Proud old Eng- land had raised her aristocratic hand, and wished when it fell -to crush, and eternally bury beneath its weight the young stream of freedom that was bound- ing to and fro in: the hearts of New England's people. The distant- reports of musketry reverberated over hill, wood and cliff, leaving a -muffled sound in the ears of M:r. Leighton, breaking up- his unpleasant meditations, to s more dreadfull apprehension, as to the results, should the British forces prove victorious. Mandolina left her room, and came to where her father was standing.  "-Father,'} said the maiden, "I think some people are out-with muskets, after game, perhaps." "Well child, let them hunt," said- the father. But if they're after their supper, we have the start of them, for our supper is already caught, and waiting to be cooked by my little maid.' He added the last witha smile, as he stooped and imprinted a holy kiss on the cheek of his child.   v s It will soon be in readiness, father." Perhaps the reader may think me wild to apply the word!" holy" to a father's kiss ; bnt no, I assert that a parent's pure kiss is holy in the sight of the P angels. Therefore I think that the word is not mis- placed.  JThat night the hero slept more oundly than he had done for some time past. He had achieved what he had been in pursuit of, for some time. He had found a secure retreat for his child in case of need.  ' He found, upon examining the rock, that he could clear away a place large enough to adimit of the entrance of one person at a time. Upon taking a light, he found that there was nothing within but that could be removed without much labor. He con- eluded that the throwing together of the huge rocks must have been occasioned by sonie commotion of the * earth. But how could an opening be contrived so as to affect an entrance into the cave without being dis- covered by the enemy, should they chance to appear in this region? At length Leighton's ingenuity stum- bled upon the right place. He informed Mandolina that as they needed a place for the covering of their fuel, he thought of erecting a small shed for that purpose. So he went to work accordingly and ere long there was something in the form of a decent look- ing Yankee wood-house, which was carried out in a dir- ect line to where the opening of the cave was. Instead of making the side of the rock do for a partition he 'used thick plank. One of these slabs against the rock, served as a door, which was contrived in such a manner that it would open and shut without making a noise. The opening and shutting was done by means of a spring, not perceivable to any save a practised eye. When shown this retreat, and made  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7571-00000077"/> 154 acquainted with its arrangements, the maid turned to her father, and smilingly remarked- "Father, I think when danger comes, that I shall I put you into the rock, whilst I turn sentinel."; "Ah, my heroic girl," sighed the father, "if every place was guarded by such a fair, brave sentinel, I think that the weapons of war. would give way for peace and good vrill towards all mankind." The above-mentioned place is the same, doubtless, that the hermit had in view when he so boldly affirmed to his afflicted guest that no blodd-hound fri'om unjust judges could ferret him out. And now, reader, I think that we must take leave of the cabin, and its owner, the benevolent hermit of the Twin Hills. But our pale traveler will again make his appearance in our history, and in a very different position from that which he now occupies. Reader, our journey from ,the Green Hills to the White Hills is not so lengthy but that our vigorous feet may perform it without much annoyance. I           ,    At CHAPTER XIl This world is naught but a chaos to my soul! Then again like a dreamless gulf- A heartless, defiant chasm; Doing-aiming at nothing but to foam at And dash the cup of bliss From the lips of mortal, And bury it 'neath its angry foaming surge: Whilst we have been lingering about the Twin Hills, we will discover what, in our absence, has trans- pired at the Pyrone Mansion. We find that they have been occupied with their own several interests. We left Byron Lenson making his way to the little brown cottage, in a perturbed state of mind. Sad, dark disappointment filled the suitor's heart; for he sincerely loved the fair Elisiner Hoyert. After bid- ding farewell to his uncle, the major, whom he met in a sleigh, he hurried homeward, encountering no one except Elbur, who exclaimed:- Well Byron, you look as though you were bound for the gallows." But this lingo was little heeded by the brother. He lingered long within his own room, when there was nothing to interrupt his furious meditations. Before he quitted his post he had, in his own mind, fought his battle of love and come off conquerer; had marched into the very citadel, had borne off his prize in triumph.  He smiled in the mad delusion! The  &#xD;<pb n="156 (Illustration) -157" xml:id="VAC7571-00000078"/>  ;               157 fall of an icicle from the roof of the cottage, near, the window where he was standing, arrested his attend tion, and in a moment- his illustrious heroism was dashed to -atoms. Now he stood face to face with his rival, the good, the wise, and the noble-hearted Clar- ence Nervourn.  The fiend Jealousy was again tug- ging at his already excited brain. Reader, it is not our purpose to startle your feelings whilst quietly perusing our pages. But truth must appear, and stand' forth in her own truthfl colors., The writer most solemnly assures the reader that the plough of truth is running its trusty share through; the whole narrative, and in its march turns up truths that have long slumbered "neath the sods of oblivion." pe Yes," muttered the young man, ' death is often premeditated and carried into effect previous to wiA- ning victory." Now horror seizes the heart of the reader. They exclaim at once:- "Why, this excited lover is a wretch!" HBut we know that the brain often totters from its- equilibrium at such outrages of feeling. But we will not anticipate any such a calamity in poor Byron's case. We will leave him, hoping that he will recover ere long; that reason will return and bring balm to , K his disordered mind. Reader, our generous hopes are becoming realized ; for, in passing the window' where we left him, we see- Byron; but not alone, for his good sister Kate has3 just entered his room, and a happy, smiling face is her's which she bends low over an open case which: she holds in her hand, and she seems to enforce her brother to participate in her joy. We cannot, from our obscure position, perceive the exact features of the: person thus pictured; but we suppose them to be "  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7571-00000079"/> In 158 -iFA  those of the young lawyer, Lawrence Hovert, Elisiner^s i     kind brother. !    Y We know not whither the sight of this brother of !5;   his almost-worship'd Elisiner, or the gentle tones of his loving sister, caused the instantaneous change which was visible in Byron's countenace; but most certainly, he was leaning over the shoulder of Kitty, with his large, piercing black eyes bent intently upon this interrting picture. Perhaps he dreams that the I   original is destined, at some future day to become his brother. And his eye brightens as he thinks that this link may have a tendency to form one between Miss Hovert and himself. Miss Amelia, as well as Elisiner, was somewhat disappointed in not seeing Kitty. But they were not so uncharitable as to add to their own pleasure, by preventing that of another. "Now Elly, we will repair to the kitchen to assist old Nelly in some of her labors this morning." Yes, reader this pleasant household was very closely knit tegether in the bonds of unity. There were no cross faces to terrify the little waiting maid. The little girl Sally sang, and chirped forth her songs in undisturbed glee, whilst her hands and feet were busy. The hired man jogged on in his steady round of duty. The merry Elbur Lenson came up'from the snow- dressed hill to frolic with Willie, old Tiger, and little Snuffer. Black old Philip rolled up his good-natured eyes, rubbed his large hands together, and ejaculated, over and over again :-"God bress good missus Nelly and Elly!" A happy household! mistress and help. The former kept up the steady habit of reading every night from the best of books, in the kitchen, during her father's absence. Little Sally's happiness had been somewhat marred during the past few days, by the pain from an aching   I               159 tooth; and on- this morning, had been advised by Miss Amelia to go to town to have it extracted. After the child returned home, she fairly danced with joy, that her tormentor had left her through the means of a strong pair of nippers. Dinner over, Miss Amelia proposed retiring to the East chamber. This apartment is the same where Elisiner sat after the death and burial of little Dora. Most readily did Elly assent to this proposal. This little room was one of the sweetest rooms in the world. There were three windows-; but the Eapt one was of purplish glass like the favorite one of Elly's in the East garret, directly above this chamber, where the woodbine rested against the pane. From the other windows the snow-capped hills were plainly visible. A bright fire burned upon the hearth, but the rays from the sun, although in Winter,were very cheering. There was a little round table, which, answered two purposes: one for a work-table, with boxes, and depos- itories for the thimbles and other working utensils of the two ladies; the other was as a tea-table where they frequently sipped their tea after other members of the household had retired. Here they might feel free from the cares of the day; and above all, the dark frowns of the stately lady of Pyrone Mansion. Into this chamber did the two ladies repair to spend the afternoon. Elly observed to her companion that she had found some pieces of ribbon in her work-basket which she would carry down to Aunt Nell to repair her head- dress with. In descending the stairs she overtook little Sally, who, through the kind suggestions of Aunt Nell, had been taking a nap to make up for a previous loss of sleep, on account of the toothache. Old Nelly was seated in a corner, worrying and fret- ting over some faded ribbons; but Elly's pleasant-  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7571-00000080"/> 160 toned voice, as she presented the ribbons, soon restored her to her usual good humor.  Nelly's daughter Ann was on the eve of marriage  with a wood-chopper working for Captain Owen, as distant neighbor of the Pyrones. The good old mother was anticipating great happiness in being present at the marriage ceremony. Elly left the 'kitchen with a shower of blessings descending upon 'her head for her kind act. The old servant and little 'Nell were left in a very happy mood.  When Elly was again re-seated in her chamber, in  company with Miss Amelia, the latter observed that she would now fufil a promise made long ago to her cousin. "Thank you, dear cousin," said Elly who compre- hended at once what the promise was. The reader will remember, doubtless, that at the commencement of our story, we gave them an account of Clarence Nervourn's and Elisiner's ramble about the extensive old garret at the Pyrone Mansion, where 'they examined the old chest of drawers. When everything was adjusted to their fancy, Miss Pyrone,' with a peculiar look resting upon her fine features said:- "Some years ago there was a scene enacted wIthin the precincts of this ancient house. Alfred Sherford descended from a highly respectable family of - At the age of twenty-two years, his parents sent him to New York to reside with a distant relative. This step was" taken in order to mitigate the: anguish of the premature death of an only sister. At this peri- od, Mynerd Pyrone, my father's eldest brother, resided in the Green Mountain state. Mary Pyrone, as I have previously told you, was a very beautiful girl. She was three months younger than Alfred Sherford-. The attachment which existed between my cousin   161 and myself was strong and biased upon a thorough knowledge of each other's sentiments. My father was living, at this time in Vermont, at some dis- tance from my uncle's, though this proved no barrier to our very frequent visits. During one of these visits, Alfred Sherford was of our little party, as the relative whom he visited resided but a short distance from Mary's home. A pleasant home it was, too:! beneath a green, spreading' oak-tree we swung, and sang our old songs and" the hills gave back the echo." My young soul was free; no dream of sad- ness ever swept its withering blight o'er my heart, to crush out the natural buoyancy of my early years. I was unconscious of the strong love that I bore for my companion until I saw the preference which he evinced for the company of my dear Cou- sin Mary. This preference would not have been remarked by a person less interested. Alfred was a perfect gentleman, and, doubtless, would have been deeply pained had he been aware that there was any- thing in his manner that showed a partiality towards either one. But alas! he: was not aware of the pain that he unconsciously gave me, Mary's idolized courn. One beautifia evening in June, a party of young persons were gathered beneath an ancient oak, which stood on an eleyated piece of ground, where it had stood in all its grandeur for more than a century, doubtless. It overlooked a long, green lane, lined on either side with beech, pine, and hemlock trees, being a favorite resort i6r the farmer's sons and ,daughters, who'lived in t  aent neighborhood. A This was a beautiful starlit evening, and the stars appeared to-me like ' angels eyes.' I gazed long and intently upon the heavenly orbs, whilst my soul pierced beyond the vaulted roof of the sky; forget- ting for the time that the Immortal had aught to do  &#xD;<pb n="162-163 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7571-00000081"/> 162 with the mortal, I dwelt for a short space within that 'region of unutterable bliss. But ere long this veil of happiness was removed by one of earth's realities. "Come, Cousin Amelia, what are you dreaming about?" .   Nothing, dear cousin, I replied, only resting my thoughts for a moment amid the lovely orbs of night! "It was proposed by the party, that upon the ensu- ing day, should the weather prove favorable, we should repair to the borders of the beautiful Lake Winnipiseogee and sail to one of its islands. This anticipated treat inspired within each heart new life and fresh animation. After some entreaties, I was prevailed upon to make one of this party. The sail proved to be a pleasant one. The time of my visit had nearly expired; but after some suggestions from my uncle, I thought best to write home to my father, asking his permission to lengthen out my visit, for the purpose of accompanying my relatives farther North to visit another uncle. This uncle is the same whom  my parents are now visiting in Vermont. When I returned I found that Alfred Sherford had not gone to his home, but that he was still a frequent and welcome visitor at the house of my uncle. Soon after a trip to the White Mountains was held in con- templation. The expected company arrived early upon the greensward in front of my uncle's house, many baskets containing eatables were piled into uncle's long farm wagon. Some of the young men went a-foot, forming quite an escort; declaring that they could trudge on foot as fast as the. horse could move along. The company intended on arriving at the terminus of the long green lane, to strike into a road which led past my uncle's mill. A few moments prior to our leaving the lane, one of our number  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7571-00000082"/> 164 espied a traveler wending his tardy way along the mill-road, towards us. Opening a wicker gate, there he stood in the lane with us. Our wonderment was fast verging towards the number ninety, when Alfred sprang from Mary's side, where he had cosily seated  himself, and with the quick leap of a deer bounded past the company, his light figure clearing the air like the pinions of a mountain bird. He was soon clasped inthe arms of his twin-brother, Loner Sher- ford. This gentleman was introduced to our corn- pany. : Elisiner, will your heart give credence when I say that my heart died within me when I witnessed the deep pride unconsciously manifested by Alfred as he introduced his brother to my fair Cousin Mary! The resemblance existing between these brothers was striking; insomuch that it would have been adifficult task to distinguish one from the other, had it not been that Loner's, height exceeded his brother's by several inches. But there was the same, dark, wavy hair-the same high brow, and large, thoughtful eyes. We retraced our steps to my uncle's, where we had a glass of spruce beer, after the new-comer had been introduced to the inmates of the farm-house. "Loner Sherford was now ready to join our party, bound to visit Mount Washington. Every -traveler to this place can testify to the beautiful prospect vis- ible from the site of this mountain. Many exclaimed at once-'Oh! how beautiful!' On returning many an imposing scene was presented to our view. But no sun-lit ray strayed through my soul. It was a dim, clouded horizon; every Star of Hope was smothered in an atmosphere of-despondency. But, my dearest Elly, I will not task your sympathies with a detail of my heart troubles. "Later, I returned home, whilst Alfred and his brother left for their home in--  . Time and absence partially   165 restored Alfred's natural vivacity. His heart was open to a new and absorbing sensation It was a sensation of Love "in her divinest mod." A cor- respondence was commenced and carried on between the lovers. In due time my beautiful cousin Mary became the affianced bride of noble Alfred Sherford. Happy couple!  "( Soon after this engagement y good old grand- father died. He had taei- r worthy part in the struggle for liberty, and had received promotion from Washington. In this time of times the youths of Vermont and New Hampshire had proved the bravery of their natures, by their noble, daring exploits dur- ing the time when " the souls of men were sorely tried." "Itwas my grandfather's wish that, Mary's father should take possession of the Pyrone Mansion, after his death. Visits were continually exchanged be- tween our respective families, and each visit was hailed with heart-felt pleasure on all sides. I avoided, as far as it was possible, encountering Alfred Sher- ford. Dear, generous Cousin Mary never once sus- pected my buried love for her dear friend. I learned, during one of these visits, that Loner Sherford had gone to France. I received the respects of this gen- tleman quite often, through the medium of Alfred's and Mary's correspondence. "This old stone mansion was, at this time, nicely fitted up in a style peculiar to the fancy of my eccentric uncle. The old brown tower about which you have so often expressed your childish admiration, was reared at this time; also the east wing. Paint and paper was not considered necessary in those days, as at the present day. Cousin Maly and I busied ourselves many an evening in the old garret, looking through the stained windows, or in the tower  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7571-00000083"/> \         166 straining our eyes to peer beyond the tops of the dis- tant hills, often catching glimpses of passing objects, crossing and re-crossing the lawns. The glimmering  stars and silvery moon smiled lovingly upon us, as we stood together with our'hands clasped. Our souls were in union at such times, and soared far above earth. Its fleeting dreams of varied deceitful joys lay fathoms below our thoughts.  Oh! how the soul is engrossed at such times where lakes, forests, lofty mountains, sloping and rising, and deeply-sunken vales are before one's vision. Whispering voices are echoed and re-echoed from  hilltop to grove. The beautiful Saco murmured sweetly not far from the mansion.  The low occasional note of the robin, and the shrill notes of the whippoorwill, heightedie the lsolemn, yet transporting feelings of the evening. Here would Ihave dwelt long after eve had dropped into the mother arms of Night! I could well have adopted the heart sentiments of some beautiful, soul- inspired poetess. 'Oh! I would be by the world forgot; I would seek some lone, secluded spot: I would choose one friend, with me to bear The ills of life, and take my share. Before the door of my cottage home I would place the bones of those who are gone; I would hold commune with the bards of old, I would list to the tales which they unfold. And in such employment would I In happiness live, in happiness die.' "I think these lines were produced by M1iss Cora Campbell." "Well- Elly, I must hasten with my narrative, and cease causing those thrills of deep sensation which for the past few moments, I know have passed through your too sensitive heart." "Dear Cousin Amelia, I was thinking of the ami-   167 able, noble lady-the mother of my own generous- hearted Clarence." Here a tear glistened in the eye of Elisiner, but, she had too much command to give license to her feelings, so she begged her aunt to continue with her story. "On one of these evenings, whilst we were looking from the tower, we discovered the approach of a chiv- alrous-appearing gentleman, who was cordially re- ceived at the mansion by my uncle. This stranger proved to be a tourist; who, like many another, had sought this place to while away a few of the sum- mer weeks. He saw my cousin, and soon loved her with all the fervency of his Spanish nature. His passion was maddening when he met with a meek refusal from the gentle girl. He then applied to my uncle; but meeting with very little encourage- ment in that quarter, his jealous nature was wrought to a very unenviable pitch. This, my Elly, is no reproach on his excellent son, your Clarence.; no, none at all." A sad, sweet smile from Elisiner was all the assur- ance that the narrator needed to know that all was just as it should be. She went on:- "The Spaniard hated the one who occupied a place in Mary's heart. Perhaps, dear Elly, you have learned from history that the Spanish nature, ill can brook' opposition. In olden times, if they could not gain what they craved by fair means, foul work was no barrier. Alfred had received many insults from Mr. Nervourn; until finally there was a change, when he appeared to be on terms of the most amica- ble nature with innocent Mary's lover. My uncle possessed, by nature, a remarkable degree of judg- ment and keen discernment. But for once his judg- ment was perverted.  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7571-00000084"/> 168 "After Alfred's return, the Spaniard proposed a trip to Italy; but this proposal, not meeting with the sanction of all parties concerned, was soon for- gotten, and the far-famed Saratoga .was the next place thought of; so thither- they intended to go. A week's delay was considered necessary, however,  on account of expected company from Vermont. A- day or two before they were to start on their pleasure excursion, Alfred received a letter from home, which proved to be from his brother Loner,'who had, the week previous, returned from France. Without delay, he wrote to Loner, bidding him to proceed at once to New Hampshire, if their parents could spare him in so short a time after his return. Moireover, tie mis- sive contained an account of their contemplated'trip, adding the united wish of the company that he should join it. He also wished him to go to an old closet at home, where he would find a suit of clothes which he had worn when a boy: a small pair of blue and white pants, a vest and jacket to match." "Why!" exclaimed Elisiner, hurriedly. "Can it be possible that I have seen these clothes?' "Yes, my dear Elly, you saw those very clothes when you watched in my sick chamber. I well remember seeing the wonder depicted on your count- enance at the time, though you desisted from asking any questions relative to the subject, fearing, doubt- less, that there was some existing link connected with my early life. I knew when you first became an inmate of my father's house; that your searching eye, and soul-fraught sensibilities could not remain long without reading some trying lines in my sad, and often unsocial manner." "Oh! you do yourself injustice, Cousin Amelia.  I will allow that your sad appearance has often caused me to believe that a cruel sorrow had, at some i   time, pierced your sensitive heart. My own sorrow taught me forbearance against intrusion upon oir secret troubles, whatever they might be."' "Yes, yes," said  Miss Amelia, empha    ' "This is a part of your angel nature, my little coZ Your discrimination and gentleness is unbounded." "Oh, Amelia, do not ascribe so'much goodness to me; I am entirely unworthy of it. But if you are not too tired to proceed, I wish- "Oh yes," returned her companion, taking out a gold repeater, which was "one of a thousand" in the mind of Miss Pyrone.  ' Our tea will be forthcom- ing soon." This was spoken in a gay manner by the lady, although it was evident that these sad events of her youth, recalled to life from their slumbering ashes, cost her much pain. "The young ladies of this vicinity-" she com- menced, "were determined to have a little military performance of their own ; and Alfred, hearing of it, entered heart and hand into their schemes. The small clothes spoken of would fit some of the boys, he thought. They were brought, as requested, by Mr. Loner Sherford, and after this affair was over the little suit was left here, and other circumstances arose so that they were never called for. They have been hanging in my closet many years. I cherish sweet, yet sad thoughts when my eyes rest upon them, and no sum could purchase them from me. "We wend. on to New York, visited the Springs, ascended the Catskills, and sailed along the banks of the noted Hudson, gathering a profusion of the flow- ers fringing its border. When we returned home, we found Mr. and-Mrs. Sherford, waiting to see their favourite sons, Alfred and Loner. Loner was to return home with them on the ensuing week, and in 15  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7571-00000085"/> 170 a month, business would demand his attention in -----where it was his intention to open trade with the friendly Indians of that territory. "I had watched every movement of Nervourns', and communicated some of my surmises to Alfred; but he, like the. rest, seemed blinded. We must mention one circumstance in connection with this subject, which, at this time, appeared entirely incom- prehensible, but afterwards, quite plain. This gen- tleman (Nervourn) appeared very anxious, all at  once, for the company of a particular servant of his; although at the time when he seemed to miss his ser- vices the most, he frequently declared that his capa- bilities as servant were so small, that he durst not trust him out of his sight for a moment; especially if fire-arms were within reach. Notwithstanding this imbecility of instinct, he was usually very obedi- ent, his master observed. At length this servant made- his appearance, but only a few days before our leaving for New York. A few odd grimaces, and a sudden jerk of the shoulders, were performed by said servant, demonstrative of the joy he felt at meeting his old master again. It was all a sham, doubtless, as a dark smile of secretiveness played about his features the while. I well remember the fellow's appearance, and maintain the same opinion concerning his duplicity now that I did then. "Three days after his entree at the mansion, it was proposed by Nervourn that there should be an equestrian party through Little Forest. Just before setting out, he called his servant to him, and in the presence of the whole group, addressed him thus: "' Now Ned, you see we are to scour yonder forest,' pointing to the designated spot. 'Do you hear what I am trying to pounce into your stupid brain, you drone ' ';   171 "Yes sar," answered the servant. "Well, then, don't meddle with the guns only when I bid you carry mine!" The fellow was now dismissed until further orders. "The day wore apace. The waning sun, with the accustomed farewell, was making his final exit over the mountain-tops, when the dismal wail of old Fido (my uncle's dog) arrested our Attention. In a moment we heard a deep groan like that of a human in distress; upon turning, we beheld Mary standing near an open door, with hands upraised, and her eyes fearfully strained towards some dark, moving objects, evidently approaching the house. We saw two men bearing the body of a wounded man." Here, Amelia seemed deeply moved; her face as pale as death, but not a tear moistened her glassy eye-balls. Elisiner's agitation was past becoming insupportable. A moment more, and the narrator continued :- "The wounded man proved to be Alfred Sherford! It was purported that this accident had occurred through the sheer carelessness of Nervourn's servant. It was also said that the fellow, seeing what he had done, had hurried with all speed through the forest, and was now secreted where the Old Scratch, even, would not be able to find him. This was Nervourn's supposition on the subject, and we all concluded that it was true. Meantime the master raved, and threatened death to his servant Ned, should he ever be so fortunate as to find him." "A mere pretence!" whispered Elisiner, almost breathlessly. Miss Amelia continued:- "The ball passed just above the elbow, shattering it in such a manner that the arm had to be ampu- tated. Sleepless nights and agonizing pains fell to Is  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7571-00000086"/> 1" poor Alfred's portion. No person was kinder, or more assiduous in his attentions to the sufferer, than Nervourn. In due time he partially recovered. "Nervourn was an exquisite artist; no person could rival him with the brush and pencil. He amused the sick and failing Alfred with sketches drawn from    nature=; all this time paying the greatest deferential respect to the sorrows of Mary. It appeared to me all this time, that there was some heavy sin resting upon this man's soul, and that he was trying to expi- ate for it by his unwearied attentions to the victim. "Loner bent over his suffering brother, with love and pity blent in the expression of his large, dark eyes. The afflicted parents were sent for, and they, too, watched, and prayed for their dear son's recovery. They were drinking painful draughts of sorrow from the cup of affliction; a cup prepared for them by the Father's hand. Though thou slayest me, yet will I trust in Thee," was the language of these parent's hearts, whilst they mourned the death of an only daughter, and feared to lose their darling son. 1- "This sister, whom Alfred wept for, had gone to Vermont, thinking that the lonliness of absence, from his early home, where, with his family, he had ever mingled in happiness, might be mitigated by   ! her presence.                     j "I left my uncle's for home, at about this time. My heart was sad and heavy-oh! how heavy, only God knoweth!"                   "Dear   cousin  Amelia, say  no  more! Your wounded spirit needs rest!" "Thank you, dear one!" "Had you not better cease in your recital alto- gether?  I have not the heart to urge you, my kind friend, against your inclination. But how can I live, and never know the consequence of this wound given to your dear friend!" J   173 "Yes, sweet coz. you shall hear all-all! Come, cheer up, Elly!' continued Miss Amelia, perceiving her young cousin's head sadly drooping upon her hands, as if she were trying to calm her spirits. "Come, Elly, we must have tea here in our own cozy little room, and you and I must try to be as cheerful as the blue-birds on the elm. So Elly hastened down to the kitchen, and found old Nelly as happy as a lark on a Spring morning. Her head-dress was completed, she had arranged it upon her head, and was now capering about the great square room like a girl of seventeen. "Hurrah'! Missus Nell, wid ye gear upon yer ole head!" exclaimed honest old Philip, as he rolled up the whites of his eyes, and "haw-haw'd" vocifer- ously. Little Sally was gathering up the fragments which had been left after Nell's head-dress was completed, intending, at some future day, to appropriate them to her own especial use. v Her little cranium was filled with happy plans, as to how she would dress her dolls. Children are children, in kitchen or parlor. I Many little niceties were placed, by Elly's hand, upon the little -round table in the pleasant east chamber, where the fire burned cheerily in the old fire-place. Miss Amelia said that she would write some letters whilst Elly was preparing their tea; as it was expected that Byron Lenson would call early on the following morning to carry them to the office; The reader knows that this gentleman had expressed his willingness to wait until Elisiner's letters were ready. The repast being finished, Amelia busied herself in folding and directing her letters, whilst her com- panion cleared away the tea things. Willie carried up the fuel which was to feed the fire during the  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7571-00000087"/> 174 evening, then stepping up to Elly, and winding his arm about her neck, he whispered:-- "Mayl I not stop here a little while, until Elbur comes up to play fox and geese with me T' Miss Amelia answered :- "' No, dear Willie, not this evening. Some other - I time will do just as well." The good lad complied without whimpering as many a lad would have done. His name was soon pronounced at the foot of the stairs by the good  X man Benson, who wished for his assistance in per- forming the night's chores. "Soon after my return home," commenced Ameliar "we received word that, Alfred often complained of severe pain in the arm which had been amputated, and which had been deposited in a box too small to admit of its being laid perfectly straight. Perhapsr Elly, you have read or heard that if it becomes necessary to take off -a limb, and if it is not amply .provided with roopi, the loser often complains of pain the same as though the arm or limb were still a part of his body. Well, the arm was dug up, but it was so much decayed that the flesh dropped off. Mary was seized with a singular notion that she must have the bones of poor Alfred's arm. One day my aunt, found -her washing these bones. The poor girl was almost heart-broken, and seemed strangely attached to these bones. Yes, long, long after the once athlectic form of poor Alfred was cold and silent in death,-" "Dead, did you say?' "Yes, dead! I know that your goodness of heart, dear Elly, will render me forgiveness, if I dra v a veil over the sad death of my dear friend Alfred Sherford." Elly laid her gentle hand upon her afflicted friend, and soothingly said:   175 "Yes, my dear, kind cousin, you have been, for years, the director of my young steps I Your worthy example, and that of my excellent motheri, will ever, I humbly trust, be -the monitors for aiding and directing my thoughts and acts into the unwavering path of every beautiful, heavenly principle, which will eventually enhance, not only my own personal happiness and usefulness, but undying benefits to the circle where 1 may be placed." "This precious repeater, Elly," continued Miss Amelia, " which you have so often seen me consult in regard to the fleetness or tardiness of time, is the very one which Alfred bestowed upon Cousin Mary only two months previous to his death. And years afterward, when this cousin bade adieu to the foibles of this changing world, she presented it to me, as a memento of the deep love which, since the happy days of our childhood, she had ever borne towards me. I hold it as a sacred relic of 'the dead! "( After Alfred's death, Mary appeared as one in a troubled dream. An unconsciousness seemed to have taken possession of her young and buoyant spirits, so -sad-so gentle was my dear, self-sacrificing Mary'! Devoted child! "Many a time when I have visited 'my uncle's, -have I found my young cousin Mary sitting perfectly listless upon that same sofa, in the old garret, which you and your friend Kate occupy so often. Her pure soul shone from her mild blue eyes, as she gazed upon the miniature of her dead lover." Elisiner started. "A miniature, did you say?        -- Her companion started alsoq as she replied: "Yes,Elly. But why do you ask' .? Without heeding the question, Elisiner entquired if it were in a case. ,.   &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7571-00000088"/> 176 "Yes, I believe that it was., But what hare you reference to, ]lly?" "I think" stammered poor Elisiner, " that I must have discovered the miniature of which you speak. Kate and I found it in a box in the old garret, one day." "Indeed! I never could  ascertain what had become of that, and several other things belonging to Cousin Mary, and to which she was greatly attached. But" she continued musingly, "I have recently discovered the priceless gems! My uncle left this place rather abruptly, owing, doubtless, to the melancholy which pervaded his darling Mary's spirits. My father left Vermont, bought, and removed to this ancestral domain. Here we have lived ever since, and in all probability, will continue to live here during the remainder of our days." "Oh, what mysterious things are connected with this old mansion!" half-whispered Elly to herself, evidently communing with her own thoughts, inde- pendent of the presence of a second person. "Oh, could its battlements but speak! could an audible voice proclailn but one half the sorrows, the joys, the deeds of chivalry, or midnight mysteries con- ceived within guilt, stained hearts, which have lain in darkness until their designs could be fulfilled without detection. Such tales would thrill the soul! Would not stouter hearts than mine, sicken? a more aged cheek than mine, blanch? But the Eye that sleepeth not, seeth, and taketh knowledge of all." Miss Amelia glanced up from the deep reverie, into which a renewal of past scenes had plunged her thoughts, and puit forth the simple question:- DI) you propose to retire soon, Elly?" Whenever ylou think -best,'l was the mechanical reply.     1" "Well, Elly, I know of no time better suited for finishing this painful narrative than the present. And perhaps your mind will receive rest from more painful conjectures, if I proceed." "I must confess that I desire greatly to hear other mysteries solved." it Well, as I was about to say, my uncle left this place and moved to B     , where Cousin Mary was married to Don Francisco Nervourn, the Spanish traveller. Elly, you need not blush, for the father of your noble Clarence had many redeeming quali- ties. He had travelled many months since Alfred's death; then returned, and assisted my uncle out of certain pecuniary troubles into which he had fallen subsequent to his removal. "The old gentleman being somewhat advanced in years, and having no sons of his own, would, it is very naturally supposed, look with some degree of love upon one who had showered so many favors upon him ; s o he granted his permission, and Fran- cisco Nervourn and Cousin Mary were united in marriage in the great square room. Many hardly spoke, at the time, strongly reminding me of some ancient tales which I have read, where the pale, passive bride, decked in bridal robes, is standing beside her liege lord, apparently unconscious of passing events. Many a time has this young wife pressed my hand to her heart, bowing her head low over it; yes, so low, that when it was raised again, my hand was bathed in tears. But, my dear Elly, do not weep; it is all past, and the dove's wings are freed, and she soars far above the dark clouds of earth's horizon! Your noble Clarence inherits all of his mother's virtues, and his father's dignity. Dignity and virtue blent, are noble-nay, divine principles, imy dove-like cousin."  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7571-00000089"/> 178 There was a low tap on the door. It was Aunt Nell come to see if Benson. would have time to go and return from Owen's before the hour arrived for reading the Bible. Miss Amelia replied there would not, and the woman returned to the kitchen. Miss Amelia continued: "Soon after the birth of Clarence, the young mother died, only surviving long enough to see and bless her sweet child. Entrusting himl to the care of an old, and faithful, well-tried nurse, I gave my dying cousin a solemn promise that I would, whilst life lasted, cherish her dear, motherless boy. You, Elly, can testify, since your residence in this house, howfaitirfully I have kept this sacred promise." Elly wiped away the tears that were coursing adown her cheeks, and answered:- "Yes, my more than cousin, the angel of your departed friend can bear witness to your fidelity towards her son. Now that I am made acquainted with these circumstances, I am not astonished at the love which Clarence has ever manifested towards you, and the return which he meets with from your- self. I have seen him, many a time, sit and watch you when conversing with persons, until his eye moistened. And once he remarked to me that you reminded him of the portrait of his mother. Cousin Amelia, please inform me how it happens that Clarence has never been made acquainted witht the fact of the relationship existing between the Pyrone family and himself?" "The reason is simply this: that his father has taken boundless measures to prevent his attaining this knowledge. The father never visits this place, and all correspondence between him and the Pyrones has long since been suspended. And it is only quite recently that he became aware of the fact of         *j       '    179 Clarence's attachment for yourself, or of his frequent visits to Pyrone Mansion. I was kept posted of the doings at the Nervourn seat by the good old nurse Nora' until during the past years. About this time, the good woman was called to her home of rest beyond the skies; where, doubtless, the beautiful mother-spirit and that of the faithful nurse, mingle their songs of seraphic joy, and keep watch over their earthly charge." Elisiner went to her desk, and soon re-seated herself by her cousin, to whom she read Clarence's last letter. The reader has been made acquainted with the contents of this letter in a foregoing chapter; the one wherein he mentions his fathers rage upon learning that his son had been, and was still, a frequent visitor at the Pyrone Mansion; and where he tried to extort a promise from said son that he would give up these visits forever. !"Yes," observed Amelia, after perusing this letter," these statements fully coincide with that which I have told you concerning the discontinuance of correspondence between his family and our's: and the fear of his son's becoming aware of the relation- ship existing between the two families. Moreover, the fear that his son would learn the truth about certain scenes which have been from time to time, enacted within and without the'precincts of this old mansion, wherein he, himself, had acted a conspiUn- ous part. But Elly, we will let the curtain of memory fall gently o'er the dead, after a few con- cluding words. "The miniature which we were speaking of, and the white bones of poor Alfred's amputated arm, I have never seen until a few months since, when I had occasion to go up into the old garret to look for something of which I was in search, when, to my  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7571-00000090"/> 180 sorrowful surprise, I suddenly came across those very same bones! You will remember that I swooned, and fell heavily upon the floor." "Oh," said Elisiner, "What a shock it must have given you! -I always thought that it was caused by some mystery connected with your illness." "I knew that this was your impression, Elly." -"But now that I know the mysterious cause of your late indisposition, my mind is relieved of one thought which has long troubled me."        3 Elisiner had a vague idea that the miniature which she had found in the old chest, was, the same that Amelia had referred to, as once belonging to her Cousin Mary. But she forbore mentioning anything further in regard to it, at present. The two ladies thought it best to avoid saying anything about finding these sad relics to the deacon, when he should return from his visit to Vermont; also making Clarence acquainted with these circum- stances when he should next pay them a visit, which they hoped would be in a few days. "One thing more, then we will descend to the dining-room. You remember that I have spoken of Loner Sherford, the twin-brother of Alfred. He was a participator in many of our joys, during that summer. I considered him, at- this time, an excel- lent young man ; in every respect equal in goodness to his deeply-lamented brother, Alfred. As I was saying, Loner possesses every qualification which would render a wife happy, should he ever choose to have one." Here a blush mantled the still-wounded cheek of Miss Amelia. "4 Whilst I was visiting at Newhuryport, last sum- mer, I had the pleasure of meeting him at the stage inn. Our happiness was mutual. /, We met still    181 again, at the house of a friend. A renewal of past sorrows only served to strengthen our already strong friendship. , During one of these interviews, this gentleman recalled to mind past hours of happiness and sorrow, in which we had participated at the house of my late uncle and cousin. He said the friendship which had commenced then, had increased, and strengthened, until it had ripened into love. Elly, I knew that his words were free from deception, that he was perfectly sincere! Suffice it to say that this worthy gentleman and your humble cousin are affianced! Yes, even so. There are a few grey hairs intermingled with the black, but his noble soul, his noble character shines through every word and act." Elisiner arose from her seat, and buried her face in the bosom of her dear friend, -Her tears were those of unspeakable joy. She had heard what could never be effaced from her memory, whilst reason retained its high pedestal. Shortly afterwards, our two friends descended to the dining-room, where they found a happy group awaiting their entrance. These people, in the sim- plicity of their hearts, looked up to our friends as examples, whom they might strive to imitate, as far as Christian character and principles concerned them. It is true that once during the reading, good old Aunt Nell cast a triumphant glance towards the stand where she had lain her head-dress; and doubt- less thoughts were constantly chasing each other through her honest cranium, of how happy she would be upon the morrow, whenodressed out in her best attire for the marriage of her daughter. The 'accustomed exercises of the evening over, the cheerful household retired, each with a conscience "void of offence." 16  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7571-00000091"/> 182 Miss Amelia bad acted up to the dictates of her own true nature, in not omitting the performance of that implicit duty which imparts to both soul and body that freshness and pervading peace of heart which showereth those heavenly drops of "love divine."-upon the toiling path of human life We say that this system carries with it an adequate sense of enjoyment. When the mind is in a healthy state, quite free from tumultuous commotions, this quiet habit acts as a'tonic upon. the organic powers of the bodily system. /;/:   CHAPTER XII "Oh! we have met- again thine eye Has pouied it; radiance o'er my heart; Again thy voice's melody Has bid each trembling fibre start. But the presumptuous hope was vain, By fond, delusive fancy taught, That absent, I could give thee pain, Or present, claim one tender thought. Farewell to fancy's glittering dream, For the dear, enchanting theme - For thee I strike the lyre no more; 'Tis past- the reign of hope is o'er. Arrows my heart invade, Silent, alone, I 'll muse on thee; Till on my voice thy name shall fade, And death's last struggle set me free." The flags of peace were waving quietly and grace- fully over the hills of New Hampshire; yes, the star- spangled banner! fraught with light from the star- lit vault of heaven.  The summits of the mountain shone with a lustre borrowed from heaven; and the ice-bound lake appeared like some magic creation from fairy-land. A peep beneath the jutting rocks, revealed the over-hanging icicles, and the moonbeams falling aslant them, presented them in the magical form of golden pyramids. The footprints of the Indian, had been, ere this period, entirely obliterated by the shuffling feet of  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7571-00000092"/> 184 Time, and were now buried deep beneath the de- cayed leaves of the forest. The forests too! Many of them had been felled by the unyielding steel of the woodman's axe. The inmates of Pyrone Mansion never slept sweeter or sounder than upon this star-lit night. Even the faithful old Tiger seemed to enjoy the universal quiet of the season; and the little sluggish dog Snuffer was unusually still, with his paws half-buried in the warm ashes by the capacious fire-place, in the square kitchen. Perhaps the reader is lost in a labyrinth of wonder- ment that the writer should expatiate so largely upon the peculiar quietude of this one night. As though every night had not its own peculiar beauties to boast of! We will endeavor to give our reader other light beside moonlight and starlight. Deacon Pyrone stood high in the estimation of all who had been favored with a knowledge of his up- right character. On the whole we feel justified in saying that no better man ever lived. His first wife, in point of fidelity, truth, amiability and piety, we think was by no means his inferior. She had the happiness which every good mother prizes above gold; that was of living long enough to see her off- spring walking in the path which is plainly pointed out in the Book of Life. The hearts and home of the bereaved husband and children -. were desolate.+ But the assurance that the departed one was a gainer by the exchange, diffused balm o'er the souls of the mourners. In time, Mr. Manell (a gentleman who appeared in the earlier pages of this story) advised the deacon to take to his heart and home a certain' maiden lady, 4 Amelia had one sister, afterwards the mother of Willie Fosdick -iho died.   I   185 by name, Miss Beatrice Gifford. It was a sore trial for poor Aunt Nell, and honest Philip, to have a new mistress. The family machinery had never moved' on so swiftly, " oiled with true kindness." The stately Miss Gifford visited the Pyrone Man- sion. Her manners did not please Miss Amelia, though her kind heart forbade her mentioning it. She plainly noted the sly glances which- were ex- changed between the servants, and her soul sickened at the thought of approaching sorrow. One evening, not long after the above visit, her fears were con- firmed. Benson made his appearance at the door of the sitting-room, sayingthat he wished to speak with Miss Amelia a moment. A sad expression dwelt upon his face. '"Well Benson, to what cause may I attribute this visit?  "To-- to - my leaving." "Your leaving, Benson" "Yes, Miss Amelia." The man seemed moved. "I haint nothin' agin you, Miss 'Mely, nor your good father, but - but - " "But what?  Speak Benson, my honest fellow." "I must leave here and look up a home of my own some where else." "Benson, I am aware of the state of your feelings. But would it not be wiser, and better, and kinder, for you to remain a while longer? Perhaps, after all, everything will be as it should be." As Miss Amelia ceased, Benson looked up and said - "If it is your wish, Miss 'Mely, I will stay." "Thank you, Benson, for this much of respect which you show my best of fathers." A tear glistened in the eye of the honest servant.  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7571-00000093"/> 186 The marriage ceremony was performed by a dcler- gyman from the town where the bride had formerly resided. A new state of affairs were commenced immediately after her arrival at Pyrone Mansion. In about one year after his union, the birth of a little June-faced baby lent its cheering rays to illume, not only the hearts of the good deacon and his daughter, but the whole household appeared to be newly awakened from a painful dream. The -beali- tiful, fairy-like Dora appeared like a heaven-lent treasure; so sprightly! so gen tle! Had the reader known this little innocent, they could not have won- dered at the depth of love manifested by Elisiner towards her. Dora Pyrone's little feet had trodden the green turf around her father's mansion but three years, when Elly went to reside in it. Mrs. Pyrone was very stately in appearance and mode of conversation. A mantle of haughty dignity was constantly thrown over her manners, especially when she was in a humor for chiding'little Sally, her serving-maid. This lady's countenance was quite fearful to witness when her foot (not the smallest in the world) was brought down upon the hard, oaken floor. The force was so powerful, that had the -head of a dog or a cat come in contact with this high- raised appendage, their skulls would have been broken, inevitably. Poor Sally, when liberated from the hands of -her mistress, would bury her head and griefs in the faith- ful bosom of Old Nell. Perhaps it wouild not be wise to relate the various modes Mrs. Pyrone put into requisition to chastise her little serving-maid. Old Philip, whenever he came in contact with her ladyship, would involuntarily roll the whites of his eyes, and retreat as fast as circumstances would ad-   187 mit. "You black scoundrel!" was the epithet which she generally gave him. This malicious invective sorely tried the patience of our colored friend. The hired man, Benson, seldom encountered his mistress. Once only had her ire been kindled against- this individual, One morning he was driving her ladyship out, when he accidentally ran the wheel against a stone, which had fallen from the roadside into the wheel ruts, sometime during the previous night; this -stone unfortunately upset the vehicle, although the lady received no injuries either bodily, or to her apparel, with the exception of a very small rent in her dress. But this was sufficient cause, in her mind, for the master to turn him adrift. Poor Benson protested that he did not notice the stone in time to prevent the accident. But this protestation only increased her rage, and she demanded him to leave, and that in a hurry, too. Miss Amelia interceded for poor Benson, so by the time that her father returned from town, his lady was so far appeased that she consented to say noth- ing about it, provided that she might never be obliged to have " that poor idiot " for a driver, again! Now poor Hiram Banks did not come off quite so easily. He was a little fellow whom Amelia had taken into the family, only a short time previous to her father's second marriage. One afternoon towards dusk this child was, as usual, fetching in the wood for the night, when he accidentally let a stick of it fall from his arms, the sharp end falling upon the foot of the new mistress who was just passing, and inflicting a slight bruise thereon. -The poor boy was cuffed, and sent staggering to the other side of the room; but fortunately for him,  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7571-00000094"/> 188  his person came in immediate contact with a large bag of feathers which Aunt Nell had deposited there, waiting for time when she might transfer them from the bag to an empty tick. The little fellow was blessed with an excellent dis- position. He had first attracted Amelia's attention whilst that lady was at   on a visit. Circum- stances of peculiar interest had brought the two together.- This amiable lady considered the interest- ing lad as her protege, and on her return home made her indulgent father acquainted with her views and wishes in regard to the subject; the father, pleased with this new manifestation of the benevolence of his daughter's heart, granted her wish, and the little fellow was duly installed with the Pyrone Mansion. Little Willie aud Hiram soon became close friends, as a great similarity of taste existed between .the juveniles. Upon the afternoon of the event lately narrated, Miss Amelia had been visiting their neighbor, Mrs. Williams. On her return she was greatly surprised and grieved to find her nephew and little Hiram stowed away in the old garret, and both weeping as though their hearts would break. What induced her to visit the garret so soon- after her return, was this : noticing the sad aspect which affairs had assumeffn the kitchen, and the doleful greeting extended ly Old Nell; whom  she immediately questioned her in regard to the whereabouts of the little boys, meeting with the sad response:-- "Oh Miss 'Mely, don't ask me no questions; I shall go from here soon. Poor little Hiram has been terribly beaten." "By whom?" demanded Miss Amelia. "By your step-mother." ,The lady retained her self-possession with some difficulty, and calmly said;-   "89 ', He was disobedient, perhaps, and deserved pun- ishment." The large eyes of the servant were turned with considerable wonder upon Amelia, as much as to say (-"What! have you no feeling either?" Amelia, instantly perceiving the burden of the woman's thoughts, said :-- ( Do not misunderstand me, my dear; kind Nell. We must try to bear one another's burdens, you know.'  "Yes, I know it; but the worst burden rests upon your good father's shoulders." ' Amelia turned to leave the room, and was in the act of ascending to her own room, when she encoun- tered Philip who was just coming from the garret. God bress you, Miss 'Mely!. we thought ye nev- er'd come agin. De boy be jest dying wid grief up dar! The Lor' have mercy on us all! 'pears like my own heart done broke;" "' Philip, be caqlm! Go to the barn and attend to your duties, and 1 will see to the children." ,( Lor' bress your good heart, Miss 'Mely!"  The black man's head was bowed low in respect for his amiable mistress. Amelia sought her closet, and there- on bended knee, found solace and rest for her troubled heart. She then ascended the garret stairs, where the stifled sobs of the two boys greeted her ear long be-   i fore she saw them. They were seated upon the old     i sofa where Elisiner and her friend Kate Lenson used  frequently to sit. With a light step the lady went up to the chil-     i dren, and in a moment both heads were nestling on her shoulder. Their tears were soon dried, and they kissed the check of their dear guardian friend who had poured healing balm into their wounded hearts.  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7571-00000095"/> 190 Miss Amelia held an interview with Mrs. Pyrone. We know not what was said, but the result was that little Hiram soon left Pyrone Mansion, and was removed to a neat little cot on the banks of the Saco River, which was a perfect little paradise. The child's parents were sought out, and proved to be excellent people who had once enjoyed the good things of life; but owing to a fall which the father had received, his thigh became badly injured,-and the mother was an invalid, from the want of proper care and encourage- ment. The pleasant little cot, with about twenty acres, on the Saco, belonged to the father of Amelia, who was prevailed upon to fit it up for these parents of little Hiram. After Elisiner-had resided at Pyrone Mansion a few weeks, she, in company with Amelia, Willie, and little Dora, -visited the rural home of Mr. and Mrs. Banks and their son Hiram, now a lad of thirteen summers. Here had he resided with his parents ever since his expulsion from Pyrone Mansion by the mis- tress. Often in summer-time had Clarence and Elisiner strolled to this lonely spot. The wild honeysuckle had been trained to run over the low but pleasant window, and the mountain-rbOe bloomed beside the porch. Peace and contentment had spread her wing over this humble dwelling of the thankful poor. Thankful they were, indeed, to know that the boun- tiful Giver of all things good, had given such a good, benevolent man to the world as Deacon Pyrone, to cheer the solitary pathways of the poor.  For some unaccountable reason, Mrs. Pyrone always took occasion to thwart her niece's wishes, whenever she found an opportunity. She appeared ,to owe her a spite, though from what cause no one I   191 knew; as Elisiner was never heard to utter an impa- tient word, or to affront her aunt in any way. Colonel Hovert, the father of Elisiner, was a gen- tleman who possessed a will of his own, and Miss Beatrice Gifford was not always free from his sar- casm. The great difference between his amiable wife and her elder sister was made plain to him, several years before. Beatriee made her home at his house in New York, with her younger sister, until three years previous to the failure and death of the colonel. When he died, she did not see fit to attend the funeral, so great was her dislike for him. Elisiner resembled her dead parent, though she partook of the retiring manners and peculiar sensi- tiveness of her amiable mother. Clarence Nervourrm was never cordially received by Elly's aunt. She was everlastingly dwelling upon the merits of Byron Lenson. In her fancy, this gentleman was a prodigy. Elisiner had surprised her ,aunt in earnest conversation with him several times, only a short time previous to her visit to Vermont. Miss Amelia had observed the same; but each, for reasons best known to themselves, forbore mention- ing the fact to the other. Perhaps another cause for the aunt's dislike might have arisen from the preference which little Dora had always manifested for the society of her cousin Elis- iner. This little maiden's heart seemed open to affection ; she was born to love, and to be loved. No two fond hearts ever loved more deeply than those of Elisiner and Dora. The mother seldom visited the sick room of her child, saying that Amelia and Elis- iner were always in the way, stealing the affections of her child. Many a time would -these faithful nurses have been thankful -if the mother would have relieved  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7571-00000096"/> 192               them for a few hours. But when requested to do so, she would draw herself up and reply: -  "As you have commenced taking the care of my child, you had, best continue yoAr attention in the nursing line." It would be unjust to say that Mrs. Pyrone did not love her child. Certainly she seemed to mourn her loss in her stern dignity. We cannot view the heart in its secret depths; therefore we must not judge Mrs. Pyrone too harshy, in, regard to the affection which she bore her child. Reader, is it strange that the inmates of the man- sion did not anticipate much additional happiness on the return of Mrs. Pyrone?  Perhaps some aristocratic reader may think that too much intimacy exists between the Pyrone family and the domestics. But remember " there is strength in union."  If one part of the domestic machinery is out of gear, the discord ,produces disorder. And who can stand, disorder in a family circle? Each servant knew his (or her) own territory, therefore no embroil- ments occurred in the household until the- good dea- con was persuaded to take to his heart and home, a new wife.- No blame need be attached to the name of the kind friend and neighbor, Mr. Manell, for the part that he performed in this union, as he did all in the integrity of his heart. The time had nearly expired, and the family were daily expecting the arrival of the master and 'mis- tress of the mansion. The early dawn of morning awakened the inmates of the house.  Old Nell arose with her mind full of thoughts of the events of the coming day.  Miss Amelia told her that she might be excused from do- ing any work until afternoon, so the old lady was soon equipped for her  ride to ---- where her   193 daughter was to be married that day. Little Sally was anticipating great pleasure in the receipt of the promised piece of wedding-cake. Amelia arid Elisiner busied themselves by baking, and doing up the fine clothes. The dinner was all in readiness when Aunt Nell returned from the wed- ding. It did their hearts good to witness the happi- ness of this old servant; especially when triumph- antly presented each member of the family with a piece of frosted cake. Miss Amelia had that morn- ing sent a new, large Bible, and Elly a worked handkerchief, to the newly-made bride. IKate Lenson was expected this afternoon and even- ing; also Mr. Nervourn. Willie begged that he might be allowed to ask a few of his nmates in the evening. (' Why this evening, Willie?" "Because Hiram might come." "But he lives two miles away." "Yes, but Benson is going within half a mile of his house to carry Aunt Nell." So it was arranged that Benson might stop and call for the boy on his return. Soon after dinner, Kate Lenson arrived. Kate was a noble girl, and her presence at the mansion was hailed with heart-felt joy. The two maidens  spoke with deep feeling in regard to the death of the   I lpoor Frenchwoman. Her few'effects had been given    ' to a nephew. Kate and Elly had befriended the poor woman to the last of her life. In return, they had received a few choice pictures, and the blessings of a , dying Christian.    ' Elisiner ventured to ask Amelia if she were will- ing that they should visit their favorite retreat. "Yes indeed, I am  perfectly willing that you 17'  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7571-00000097"/> 194  should do so, for I have about a dozen more pages to read, in the book that Mr. Manell lent me." Kate laughingly remarked that she supposed that the reading would afford her more pleasure than the company of two grave nuns like Elisiner and herself. This was a very happy family just now. Willie was in his element about the expected company. Elbur Lenson had come up to assist his friend Willie in his arrangements for the evening. Quietness, and a mysterious solemnity seemed to hold dominion in and about the precincts of the old garret. Everything remained untouched. The manuscript of the old African woman was again brought forth from beneath the old sofa cover, and its faded pages perused. A  deep solemnity swept over Elly's heart. Her friend enquired into the cause of her unusual sadness, and Elly men- tioned a few of the incidents connected with the life and sorrows of the nmother of Clarence. This lady's heart-troubles were long dwelt upon. Elisiner had previously gained permission from Amelia, that o circumstances admitted, she might relate some of the particulars relative to the fate of Mrs. Nervourn, to her friend Kate. Whilst these young ladies were seated in the cosy east garret, they were suddenly surprised, and some- what alarmed by hearing strange sounds proceeding from the large garret. Repeated knocks were'heard as if the raps fell upon an empty chest. Kate grew pale and appeared motionless. At first, Elly seemed inclined not to partake of her friend's fears ; fears of what she knew not. Stouterand- older persons than the two maidens would have been justified in feeling frightened, nay, superstitious! A sudden thought seemed to awake- in Elisiner's mind. She whispered to her friend to sit quietly   195 where she was, and she would go round by the other stairway and reconnoitre in the -old garret. But Kate had no notion of remaining alone, so both crept stealthily down the winding staircase which led from the east wing of the mansion. Kate stationede herself by the foot of the stairs. Elly crept slyly up and secreted herself behind the- huge chimney.  Rap - rap - accompanied by a faint "Oh-h!" then all was hushed; then a low whispering-; then a gggling; now a voice:- O- h Elbur, I'll bet my big sled that we've frightened the nuns down stairs!" The boys screamed outright, simultaneously. What had occasioned this sudden fright was this; Elisiner, from her hiding-place, had seen the head of one of the boys appearing above the top of an old chest, and a pair of eyes peering through the rounds of a broken chair, which- was placed upon the chest ; when, in a low voice, she said:- ' Boys, boys, low whisperings near thee; hollow rappings please thee!" At this time, a voice from the other world could not have sounded more strangely. "Boys, boys "-- was echoed from the remote corners of the garret. There was a crash of the broken chairs from the: chest to the floor, and the boys rushed out, over all impediments, down the stairs, through the narrow passage past Kate, very much frightened, and look- ing as pale as marble columns. They did not stop until they found refuge from ghosts and goblins in the old square kitchen, near Aunt Nell. Elisiner joined IKate, and in a few words explained all, when the two had a good laugh in spite of the recent fright. They then descended to the kitchen, where, they found the servants in great alarm. The little  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7571-00000098"/> 196 boys were trembling from head to foot; Philip, Ben- son, Aunt Nell and Sally were crowding about them. "De laws sake! what's de matter wid de young uns?" inquired Phil, with his great eyes rolled up in fear and astonishment. "Miss Amelia soon explained all, then reprimanded the young rogues for their part in the matter, and made them  promise that they never would allow their love of fun to carry them to such a length again. The girls left the kitchen, and the servants laughed at the expense of the boys. The evening proved to be a very fine one. Soon after tea the little folks began to make their appear- ance. All was life and hilarity. A large west room and two smaller-ones were divested of their furniture. The elder members of the party did not care to turn surgeons for the evening, or to devote their time to binding up bruised fingers, broken noses, or toes; so early: precautions for removing all impediments were attended to. The common sitting-room was lighted, and the wax candles sent forth a brilliancy that seemed to lend a magic charm. Rare pictures rested on the walls. There was one of Washington, who appeared to be renovated with life; the Battle of Lexington and Bunker Hill, where the dead and dying were strewn upon the ground, and the war-horse was pranc- ing in all his mad glory. Then there was a portrait of the first Mrs. Pyrone; her mild, deep blue eye looking upon all. The good deacon's portrait 'lung- beside her's; he was holding the bridle of a favorite horse ;, "Mountain Leaper," as the fleet animal was styled by the deacon's friends. The shades of n'ight had settled upon this portion of the world. All out-of-door objects would have been rendered invisible, but for a few straggling   197 stars. Old Nell, on this evening, appeared to be in her element. She expressed herself:--  4 Oh laws sake! my old heart-is leaping in my throat, and dancing for very joy, to see my own bonny Hiram here once more.' Little Sally was not debarred from participating in the festivities of the evening. Kate Lenson and Elisiner were bending intently over a picture. A tear glistened in the eye of the former. "t Indeed Kate, why need you be so distrustful, and allow such misgivings to take possession of your heart? I know that the noble nature of my brother Lawrence and your own nobleness and gentleness of soul were intended to be blent together, and-- List . what bells are those?" Indeed, they came nearer, and now paused at the front door. In another minute the huge brass knocker was sending its echoes through the long hall. The door was swung open by Benson and Clarence Nervourn stood among the ladies.- MisJ Amelia and Kate each seized a hand of their friend, and Elly stood in the background, with a gentle smile resting upon her lips. Happy indeed were these lovers, after so long an absence! The evening passed as it had begun- pleasantly. In the course of the evening, Clarence spoke about seeing an old friend; one whom he had met some years before whilst travelling, and had afterwards spent some months with him at a seminary in New York. The health of Clarence had not been so that he could pursue his various studies; so he had been quite a tourist during the past few months. He had visited several of the Southern States in company with a chum of his. He spoke quite favorably concerning  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7571-00000099"/> certain planters; adding that many misrepresenta- tions had been set afloat in regard to the general character of the masters of slaves. The gentleman allowed that there were exceptions. Mr. Nervourn's conversational pouwers were excellent, though his lan- guage was never presuming. The lively mirth of the juveniles echoed through the rooms, borne on the light wings of laughter. Suddenly all is hushed; doubtless more quiet games have -been introduced among the boys. A crackling of crusted snow is heard near the sitting- room- window, causing a sudden suspension in the conversation. Footsteps are stealthily approaching upon theembankment of snow which still maintains its position in despite of recent warm rains and lunny weather. Miss Amelia arose and closed the shutters. A deep, furious growl from Tiger was heard in the hall. Elly opened the sitting-room door, and the shaggy Waded monster slowly advanced into the room. Som-e years before, sixty dollars were offered the acon by a wealthy Georgian, for this valuable ani- -Soon all was quit; Tiger had lain himself down, as huge head resting between his paws. Ever and mnon a low grumbling was heard, signifying that he esidered himself a watchful sentinel over these A low tnack Upon the  utside of the of the door an- tunced that another caller was seeking admittance. e proved to be Byron Lenson, who hadi called, as he had, to see his sister safely home. The gentlemen Lted to play an agreeable part; but it was evident hat' it was all a feint. Elly thought so. The gentlemen soon reverted to their past- acquain- anceship; though Byron did not appear to be: dis a         a   posed to strengthen these reminiscencesi, He seemed to wish to play his part in the background. The little party broke up well satisfied with their evening's entertainment. Kate left for home with: her moody brother, and Miss Amelia retired. Now reader, we must -drop the curtain over the occupants of the sitting-room. No intrusion of ours: shall interrupt this interview. Early dawn found the inmates of the mansion bestirring themselves. Mr. Nervourn was intending to remain only a few days with them. He had long wished to witness some of the soul-touching scenes on the other side of the Atlantic, and now thought of gratifying that enthusiastic desire. The heart not unfrequently yearns to behold an&amp;. drink mighty draughts from- some far-offedifice where great and lofty deeds have been achieved in past ages.   Yes, this devoted student had often experienced aspirations-like these, and had frequently met with stern disappointments. After an hour's conversation with Elisiner, Clar- ence deemed it expedient to defer this plan of travels ing, and to return to C----, where he might pursue his studies, whilst any degree of health remained. At nine o'clock a note of invitation  arrived at, the mansion, soliciting the company of Mlr. Ner- *vourn, Miss Amelia and Elisiner at dinner at the' house of Captain Watson and lady. She accepted the invitation with pleasure, and sent a note to this effect by the bearer. They returned at night-fall, finding an invitation to spend the ensuing evening with the Lenson fam-; ily. Miss Amelia declined the invitation for herself: on the plea of havingI many things to attend to, subsequent t tthe arrival of her parents, who: were daily expectedO.   &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7571-00000100"/> 200 r Clarence and Elisiner were cordially received at the cottage, though the latter was agreeably surprised at Byron's- absence. She learned that he had ob- -served about an hour before, that pressing busi- ness demanded his immediate attention in town. Miss Amelia, directly after their departure, went to the kitchen department, where she superintended affairs for an hour or so ; then retiring to her own room, she became deeply engaged in an interesting volume. Whilst she was reading, she heard hurried steps on the stairs, and her door soon yielded to the hasty touch of Phil, whose face was even a few shades darker than usual. "Oh  lor ' bress ye, Miss ' Mely I tink de bery debil be up in de garret dar!" "What do you mean?" demanded Miss Amelia. "Why, up dar, missus, in de ole drum!" "What makes you think so?" "I tink so from de fast; den de ole drum  keeps moving!' And   the old fellow cast an affrighted glance behind. "What were you up in the attic for?" Amelia now remembered hearing an unusual bus- tle about the stair-way. "I went up dar to get some leetle bells to hang on Massa- Willie's hed."- Dont be alarmed, Phil, I will look into this mat- ter myself." Phil departed, resting assured. She thought at first, that she would take the light and go immediately to the attic; but on second thought, concluded to defer it until the morrow. The evening slipped quietly away, when, a few moments after ten, Mr. Nervourn and Elly returned. The family had not retired. Clarence read a portion   201 from the scriptures, and afterwards all sought their rest for the night. The ensuing morning, Benson handed a letter to Miss Amelia, adding that he had forgotten to give it to her- on the preceding evening. Upon opening it, she found it to be from her father, who would be at home on the coming morning. Clarence said that he was sorry to be debarred the pleasure of seeing 'his friends, but it would be necessary for him to take his leave early in the morning. Benson was to drive him a few miles to meet the stage which he intended to take. At the expiration of a few weeks he hoped to be with them again. Byron Lenson had returned from the city only an hour before the departure of our young friends from the cottage, and never-had Elisiner enjoyed his con- versation more. He seemed unusually agreeable, and perfectly gentleman-like in deportment: He was certainly very handsome: no one in this vicinity could boast of greater personal attractions. Amelia said that he had had ample time for due consideration and observation, and perhaps he might have detected enough to assure him that a continu- ance of his overtures towards her affections might prove worse than useless; therefore, like a true phil- osopher, he had abandoned all thoughts of winning her hand and heart. Elly wrote her mother that as her uncle and aunt had not returned, she feared it would be impossible for her to visit her dear home as soon as she had anticipated; but she longed once more to nestle her head upon that dear- and loving bosom, and to hear the sweet, familiar voices of her brother and sisters. In the meantime, Clarence and Elly proposed searching a remote cornerof the main garret. Ame- lia assured them that she was quite willing to forego  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7571-00000101"/> 202 the pleasure of their society for a few hours, if such an absence would tend to ensure their own happiness. "I have often wondered why the founders of this mansion should have left a' fire-place up here," observed Elisiner. "I too have been surprised to -behold a bedstead in such a locality," responded Clarence. "Indeed " said Elly, "I haven't noticed this ancient piece of furniture until one day a few weeks since, i Katie, being in one of her frolicsome moods, said that she had half a mind to purchase this modern concern of my uncle's, to transfer it to the cottage for her own special benefit." On approaching it, they found that the large bun- dle lying upon it was a small feather bed, and a pair of pillows. They were in a sad condition, for want of proper care. "I perceive," said Clarence, turning towards his companion, "1 that you are fond of adornments?" "( Why yes," said Elisiner, I am fond of anything bearing the least resemblance to a forest; but I attribute no praise to myself in the cutting and. arranging of these colored paper flowers, which decorates these faded pines." "Indeed! Then whose fairy, tiny hand did place these paper blossoms  upon the pines?" asked Clar- ence, walking nearer to the fire-place. "It was our good friend Katy. She cult them out one day, and stole slyly up here and pinned them upon these bushes."  Elly then added:- "Oh! Clarence, there is another thing that Kitty and I  discovered a short time ago." Clarence turned- pale. In a moment Elly under- stood the current of his thoughllts. He feared that she might have found the white bones in the old chest.   203 She went on talking the same as if she had not observed the changing expression of his countenance. Many comments were made in regard to the cork leg with the foot attached, which Elly showed to Clarence. She said that she would ask Miss Amelia about it, though she might be as ignorant concerning it, as themselves. Clarence went to another part of the garret where there were several faded pictures hung against the blackened wall. He thought that he recognized the features of his good old nurse, Nora, in one of these portraits. But time, dust, and cobwebs had played such antics over the canvas, that he was compelled to relinquish further attempts in trying to force memory to bring sufficient bearing upon his optical vision, to identify in the nearly obliterated face before him, the features of his faithful old nurse, and guide of his youthful steps! After dinner, when Clarence and the ladies were engaged in .conversation, Willie bounded into the sitting-room with an open note from Kitty-Lenson to Elisiner. She informed her friend that Byron was on the eve of starting for Lyons, where urgent busi- ness would detain him until long past Spring. He wished that his best respects might be bourne te her. Then came the following words :-- "Oh! my own dearest friend Elly, how can I write it! Your friend Kate has this very morning received a note from----  whom? I think I hear you ask. Oh Elly, will you believe me when I say that I have heard from your own noble brother Lawrence? This heart of mine is fluttering strangely. A  letter from a highly-educated, elegant young--But I must not write more, else this note will swell to- the propor- tions of a letter. Come! come! my dear Elly, a whole budget of newly-awakened interest is awaiting you."  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7571-00000102"/> -204 After the perusal of this note, a smile not only played about Elly's mouth, but a sweeter one danced joyfully about her heart. Kate LeRson was a noble girl; well worthy to win the pure devotion of her brother's heart. Miss Amelia sat for some time deeply buried in thought. Then looking up she asked her companion if they had made any new discoveries in their recent rambles about the old garret. There was a slight emphasis in her tone which evinced a depth of mean- ing. Elisiner started; dropped her knitting and stared at her cousin in amazement. Clarence 'was carelessly turning the leaves of a large volume, vait- ing in suspense for Elly to answer her cousin's ques- tion. A pause, then Elly answered mechanical- ly :- 'Nothing, I believe, only a few faded portraits which attracted Clarence's attention. These ancient pictures must have rested in their present position for many years?'" '( Mally of them are considered of small value, as the originals have long since died. There is one, however, which I intend to transfer to a more suita- ble locality." "To which one do you refer, Amelia?" "To that of a person with whom 1 was personally acquainted, some years ago." Elisiner expressed some surprise that anything which she considered so valuable should be suffered to remain in an obscure place for so long a period. "It has often appeared singular to me," said Miss Amelia. "In-the spring of 18-, a maiden Welsh lady was stopping in W---- , with some of her rel- atives, when, by mere chance, I was once thrown into her society. Being semewhat interested in the many singular anecdotes which she related, also of the   205 pleasing tales of her own native land, I one day ventured to ask her how long it was since she had come to America. I soon learned that she had been induced to immigrate by an indescribable love of travel. This woman was no ordinary person. I was astonished to hear her speak so familiarly of the state of New Hampshire. She spoke at one time of remaining many weeks in the region; of snows, and of. watching the sun sinking behind my own favorite hill-tops. This singular person, in the course of conversation, mentioned something about a certain. old forest. She said that she was famrliar with most of the noted places about New Hampshire. Men-  tioning numerous names of individuals, I found that she- not only remembered the names bat also famil- ' iar little incidents connecting a chain linking minds and events together." "Once she exclaimed :" , The events which occurred at the Pyrone Hlouse, were-' "At the Pyrone Mansion in New   Hampshire, do you- mean?"  I eagerly enquired.        - "Before an answer could be given, Dormer Elger- ton arose from hifs chair and formatliy 'introduced me ' as ' Miss Amelia Pyrone.' 'The woman arose in great agitation, extending her somewhat withered hand to me saying that she was well acquainted  with my family;  that my mother and. herself were two of the most frolicsome girls that ever jumped over hedge, or leaped a brook; ' thati no American lark ever sang sweeter than Olivia Bradwill. "My own,-own dear, sweet mother! I'cried, sei,- ' ing the old lady's hand. 'But I thought that my / mother never was in Wales??'  "Yes, my   birdie, she was there with her father,  18  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7571-00000103"/> 206 Lieutenant Bradwill, your own grandfather, my dear Amelia." "'Oh!' I exclaimed, "how I must love you, who once knew my own dear mother!" We will not part," she said. "' No indeed!' I exclaimed. You must go home with me-you must not refuse! "Then suddenly remembering my step-mother, I refriained from entreating her any more. I returned home in a short time. Not long afterwards my Welsh friend arrived at the mansion, accompanied by Dormer Elgerton. "The afternoon was fine; gentle nature smiled in her lovliness. Mr. Elgarton had previously returned to Abbington. My father seemed unwearied in his demonstrations of joy at the presence of one who had once been familiar with, and loved by, his own departed Olivia. They conversed on various inci- dents, in which I took no part. I learned that our new friend had never but once visited these North- ern realms since my father's marriage. She said: "'When my father was in Detroit, as he frequently was, I spent several months in the family of your Grandfather Bradwill. Previous to this protracted visit, and long after it, I mingled often with Olivia Bradwill. I remarked that she still enjoyed these rambles among the cleared-up pastures. At one time I recollect that she was frightened by an enor- mous owl.            "Then turning to my father, she said:-- "'You remember that ledge of rocks east of the cascade?  "'Oh yes! I well recollect a narrow escape that I had in that place; a sad fall over the dashing waters  and craggy rocks! It was a day of rejoicing over thi, and indeed, all the states. But please proceed;   207 I believe you were relating something about an owl?' "'Nothing more, sir, concerning his owlship!' "At this pause in the conversation, a confusion of sounds from the back part of the house, attracted our attention. There was a clamerous throwing together of doors, then a rush to the apartment where we were. My father had arisen, and was crossing the room, where he confronted a frightened group . . "'A bear! a bear!' " shouted half a dozen voices at once. "'Soon all hands were engaged in trying to exter- minate the shaggy foe. Madame Doran and myself were left alone on the next day, when all at once I discovered that she was missing. Hearing footsteps in the garret, I concluded that she was there; as she had, the previous day, expressed a strong desire to visit that place, hinting at something beyond my comprehension. I found her looking dismally to wards an old bedstead; the one, Elly, which you asked me about and although I evaded a direct explanation at the time, I intended waiting only till the proper time should arrive, when I was willing to tell you all. The time has come. That bed is the one which poor little Frederick Eugene died upon." "What! Amelia, did any person die in that little old garret?" "Not in the garret, Elly; but upon the couch which is there now. This little fellow was a Swedish boy, brought to this country by a money-loving man. The child was given into this man's care by an old soldier who died of wounds recently received in bat-  At this period it was no uncommon thing to hunt the black bear, as this animal caused great destruction.

The war was over, and the wounds partially healed; but the breaking out afresh caused his death. A few gleanings were presented to the benefactor of ,his son, who solemnly promised that he would be- friend the boy. Time wore apace; the orphan child was treated in an unkind manner. At -one time his leg was broken through the sheer carelessness of his master. The latter, however, to ease his conscience probably procured a wooden leg for him. Elly started; but the narrator, not noticing her movement of surprise, continued:- "Then, as though he had performed all that justice demanded of him, he commenced anew by treating his victim even more rigidly than before. Your grandfather came across this child whilst pursueing his travels. He raised the little fellow from the depths of destitution, and carried him home, to this very house, and treated him very kindly. But the former ill treatment had done its work; the poor lit- tie boy died, after a lingering illness on the verycot- bed of which we have spoken. I do not know by whose orders it was promoted to the upper loft. I remember how strangely were my feelings wrought 'upon, when I heard peremptory orders for I'hil to convey the bed and bedding to the large garret. I wondered at the time, but forbore putting forth any questions thinking that it might be only one out of the many strange freaks of my step-mother." "You say you desired that it might be removed be- low when little Dora was sick?" Elisiner remembered hearing Amelia make such a request, as the bed- in question was small, and could lbe easily moved. '- Amelia, please tell us something about the wloden leg." 'Oh yes," rejoined Clarence., "I too am inter-   209 ested in the wooden appendage belonging to the liHt tle boy." "I asked the same question of my friend," said Miss Anmlia. " but she knew nothing of its wherea- bouts." "Then, Miss Pyrone, I think that we can enlighten you a little on the subject." "Indeed! can you?" Clarence and Elisiner led the way to the garret, where the wooden leg was brought from its resting- place, and displayed before the astonished gaze of M-iss Amelia. A few tears fell from compassionate eyes, when the limb was replaced in the box from whence it was taken. Clarence observed that a strange feeling came over him whilst he was reviewing a certain portrait, among, these hanging at the end of the room. "Indeed!" exclaimed Miss Amelia; adding:-"- I will give you this portrait if you would like it, Mr. SNervourn, -if you will account for any questions which are asked concerning it. But thereis:no llkeii- hood that any such will be asked, for -these old things will remain in their present positions for years-to come, without being once removed.."  "I thank you, Miss Pyrone, and I must beg your permission to deposit it in some place where it will be in less danger of becoming imore defaced than it Mis now.         -  "I remember," commenced Miss Amelia, 'cOf being very much alarmed at one time, in this plaice." "At what, and when?"? demanded Elly. "Were you alone?" enquired Clarenee.  "Yes, I was quite alone.. Why Hlly," added RMis Amelia, with -a . thoughtful smitle;, "you need nt expect to hear anything very; excitable. 8;-Ome y' B since, having been much troubled by rats, midy. tifathe  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7571-00000105"/> set a steel-trap up here. The weather was extremely warm, and the windows were epen to admit what air was stirring. At this time an enormous owl had been making depredations in the midst ofour poul- try. The men-folks had often tried to secure his owlship, and had as often been defeated. One morn- ing hearing a great rustling among the old papers up here, occasioned by the rats, as I supposed, I ran up and beheld an owl held fast in the steel-trap. Doubtless he had flown in through the open window, and had unconsciously stepped into the unsprung trap. With much ado he was cornered and secured. But I plead guilty, for once in my life, of being 'brought up in the woods, Sand frightened by an O   O   O 0     '0 The day was wearing away. The deacon and his wife were expected home before nightfall. Clarence signifiediis intention of leaving soon after dinner. As he recollected hearing his father speak of an elder brother of his; saying nothing definite con- cerning him, however; though he (Clarence) inferred that something of/,an unpleasant nature subsisted between. He then said to Elly, in a low tone:- "With your consent, my dear Elly, I will go to- immediately after leaving A--- , where I shall probably engage myself as a teacher." Then with a sweet smile, bending low over the lovely girl, he continued :- "And what would you say to my taking a certain putpil of mine with me? one, too, who would be a co-worker with me, not only on the- Ocean of Life, but until we should lose ourselves in the Ocean of Eternity?"   2" The countenance of the young maiden wore an expression of superior eloquence, which at once dis- played the texture of an intellect which must have been run in Nature's finest mould. We have no license to listen to the conversation which is passing between the lovers. A few words or sentences are bourne along to our ear. "Oh Clarence my dear mother and sisters-I must not leave them yet!" All are busy; dinner is over. Clarence has been prevailed upon to remain until the morrow. The kitchen presents a doleful appearance. Poor Aunt Nell! her under lip has dropped some ways out of its original place. Everything is in perfect order. The pantry shelves are loaded with the good things of life; both the substantials, and fanciful dainties, which the hungry appetite craves.. Amelia and Elisiner havejust given the finishing touches to the rooms; the candles are lighted, agd the fire sends an unusual glow throughout the sitting- room and kitchen. Old Tiger has assumed a listen- ing attitude. '  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7571-00000106"/> CHAPTER XIII. We hear the chained hills cry That a mighty storm is nigh. On  the twenty-second of March, 18-, a snow storm was hurriedly advancing from the mountains. Now the large flakes are falling thickly upon the gable-roofed mansion. There were indications of a regular northeaster. "Travellers that chance to be out on such a night as this is going to be, will grumble some, I reckon," said Benson, who had just come in from the barn. "Yes," responded black   Phil, "the Lor' have marcy upon massa Pyrone, if -he be coming home to-night!" Amelia looked fearful, and remarked to Elly that sWhe hoped that her parents would not attempt to buffet the storm. All eyes are turned towards the north windows, from  which a view of the road was visible. There comes a sleigh, with two forms therein, comfortably wrapped in buffaloes and blankets, and handsomely sprinkled with snow-flakes. The vehicle turns up into the old avenue, and old Phil gives a  snort of satisfaction, as it rounded the old familiar road leading to the stables. The   outside door was thrown open, and Mrs. Pyrone was assisted up   the snow carpeted steps by   213 Amelia 'aud Elisiner. The two ladies were assiduous in their attentions to the traveller, and she was soon divested of her outside habiliments, and seated in ;a comfortable rocking-chair by the side of .a cheerful fire. It is ftrue that this lady, when the girls were disrobing her person of the snowy, stiffened robes, loudly declared that she believed that they intended to kill her outright i" adding that she had been drag- ged all over creation!" Meanwhile the good deacon had given his horse into the care of old Phil, who had nearly dislocated his master's shoulder in his honest attempt to. shake his hand in a sientific manner, all the time exclaim- ing. :- "-Oh, Lor, bress you Massa Pyrone!" The good master was equally pleased to behold the honest visage of his faithful servant once more. Clarence assisted his friend in removing his out- side garments in the great kitchen, whilst Aunt Nell bustled about in her own peculiar way, :saying ,', se knew what she's about! A    mug of warm drink was soon brought to the master. ," Thank you, my good Nelly, for attending so quickly to my comfort." The faithful creature replied, with glistening eyes:-- "Whose comfort should I attend to if not yours?" All this time little Sally had, been. vigorously stirring the fire. The dogs were capering about with unbounded glee.  Every moment seemed an age to Amelia and Elisiner. That dear familiar voice in the old kitchen, had reached. their ears by the opening of the doorz. They heard their own names mentioned.  A moment more, and  they heard the well-known footstep sounding upon the oaken floor of the long entry  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7571-00000107"/> 214 leading from the kitchen directly to the dining-room. An anxious look passed over the daughter's fine countenance. The door opened, and father and child met in one long and loving embrace. Behind them stood Elisiner, half-timid, yet con- scious that a kiss from her dear uncle could not be witheld from her. The good deacon loved his pure- minded niece as he did his own child. Mrs. Pyrone arose to her feet, loudly exclaiming : "This is a pretty way, Miss Elisiner! You go into raptures upon meeting your uncle, whilst you hardly deign to shake hands with me, your own aunt!" But why was it thus? The aunt coldly repulsed every act or feeling of kindness or affection, which she saw springing up from the pure, loving fountain of her young niece's heart; and with a cold, heart- less rebuke, would send the warm, gushing current of love back to its place, to lose itself in other kin- dred streams. But not so with the kind-hearted uncle. This - gentleman understood the human heart, and to his own cost had paid ten percentage on every iota of tenderness which he had labored in drawing forth from the stony depths of his wife's iron-guarded heart. After partaking of their warm supper, the family prepared to retire. Elly read two of David's sweet refreshing Psalms, and Clarence led the devotional exercises .of the evening. On  the ensuing morning Clalence departed intending, however, to speldd a few days at the man- sion, when he returned. In the course of the forenoon, whilst Elisiner was busy in the pantry, she overheard her aunt in the act of interrogating the housekeeper as to the pro- gress of household affairs, during her absence. She enquired :-   215 Has Byron Lenfson been here of late?' "Oh no, indeed, Elbur says that he has gone a long way off." ( Has he? Do you-know when, Nell?" "No ma'am," replied honest Nell. Through a crack in the door, Elly could see her aunt's face. A, sinister malicious smile lurked about her pinched up mouth. Elly received a note from Kate Lenson, stating that she was going into town to spend a few days with an old schoolmate, Sarah Cross. She insisted that Elly should spend a few hours with her mother the next day. O   O    O   O   O   O "Here, you little culprit! What do you mean, by your carelessness?" cried Mrs. Pyrone to little Sally, at dinner-time. "This makes the second time that you have spilled water upon the floor!" "Well, never mind a little water, expostulated the husband, after the trembling culprit had left the room. "You know that everybody is liable to acci- dents ; especially children." "Children!" reiterated the exasperated woman. "Yes, I daresay that you will even praise even your stupid servants, when they do wrong, on purpose to torment me!" "Really, aunt, I do not think that Sally spilt the water purposely.' "Hush! Miss Elly." "Would you tell me I lie, Miss Pert?" "No indeed, I would not, auntie." "I think," said the deacon, " that your niece would no; be gailty of such a gross misdemeanor as to tell anybody such a thing." Good Aunt Nelly folded the little Sally closer to  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7571-00000108"/> 21CI her bosom this night, than ever; well kniowig that the sun of domestic peace had hidden its cheery face blehind a thickly-veiled cloud; that cruelty was, in the future, to be dealt out unflinchingly to all. The good creature's heart was sorely pained. She thought that she would speak to her newly-married daughter, to see if she might live with her in the spring, when she commenced housekeeping. But how- could she leave dear, kind Miss Amelia, and gentle Elly? The tears sprang into her kind old eyes at the thoughts. And then there were so many sweet associations connected with her present home; the home that she had learned to love in past happy days, when the good mother of Miss Amelia lived. Her thoughts wandered still farther. The sweet, angel face of little Dora presented itself; she pon- dered long upon the self-sacrificing nature of this dear child, when hovering about the sick-couch of little Sally; of her lisping, loving words; how she culled every choice flower from her little garden for the sick child. The sweet essence of affection was threading its way through the heart of poor aunt Nelly. She remembered on one occasion, how cruelly the mother snatched a bunch of raisins from little Doras hands, when the child was presenting them to the invalid, to be put away until she should be well enough to eat them. But long ere this, the earthly sun of this sweet, amiable child had set. Little Dora's form was sweetly reposing where the voices of unkindness could not reach her. Each and every one of her endearing ways were held in-sweet remembrancee laid safely away upon the altar'of poor Nell'sheart. This faithful old servant possessed sterling worth : anm undying perfume of the worth of the little   217 departed star shed its brilliance over her care-worn ader, may each one ofs    live thr   our Reader, may each one of us so live through our existence, that some sweet perfume may dwell in the hearts of our mourning friends! How often about the poor lonely heart blooms some sweet floweret, laden with the sweet dews of an angel's love! Christ's life was lowly; yet how. unspeakably beautiful! Clarence departed for A--, partly to fulfil au engagement, and partly to seek restoration in. health. Elisiner constantly prayed for the latter. It was on the -twenty-first of March. The deep snow was lying upon the bosom of the brown earth in such settled composure, that it might indicate that old Winter intended to maintain his present position for many months to come. A cold and pro- tracted winter is not, as a general thing, agreeable to most people. Though what is so pure and spot- less as a virgin bank of snow? and then the spark- ling icicles! how resplendent, when the clear sun from the blue heavens, looks down upon them. Elisiner intended to comply with her friend Katy's request; that of calling on her mother during her absence. Independent of fulfiling the promise made to her friend, it was happiness to herself to call upon the amiable widow. She found everything at the little brown cottage the same as ever; it was the same Eden-like home nestled down among the snow hills; the long limbs of the sturdy trees bending over the low roof, as if to protect it from rude winds and storms. Thle morning sun-beams fell aslant the evergreens which stood like proud sentinels on either side of the long lane which led to the cottage. The widow informed Elly that she had, on the 19  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7571-00000109"/> 218 wening before, received a letter from her brother; Major Elwell, stating that he was on the way to her cottage. The good lady was busy with her morn- ings baking. so Elly- readily offered her assistance in pie making. Elly  had gained permission to remain all --day -with Mrs. Lenson, if she chose; a favor which she often wondered at, as not exactly in keeping with her aunt's general unkindness. Mrs. Lenson was a lady, whose very tones inspired her friends with love; her gentle words and rich sentiments came from a cultivated heart, wherein dwelt a pure fountain of those holy, loving principles, which: leave a good mind enriched, and an impure mind embittered. She proposed retiring a short time, for the purpose of letting Nature have a respite in the drowsy arms of Morpheus; for, as she said, her brother had a peculiar way of protracting aconversation when once commenced, so she must have rest to gain a supera- buindande of strength to enable her to hold her part it: the anticipated tete-tete. The little parlor of the cottage was one of the sweetest, coziest rooms in the world. Elisiner occu. pied a high-backed chair in this apartment, watching. the movements of Elbur's little dog Ponto, who, a few moments pievious had been thrust into this room, by his young master, with a request, to Miss Hovert to. please keep him 'there, as Wilhe had come down to slide on the ice with him, and that his barking would disturb his mother's rest. " All right, my good, thoughtful Elbur, to be so careful-of your mother's comfort!"  And she promised td restrain the dog from mak- -1:g an uproar. Willie and Elbur were soon enjoying the rustic pleasures of skating on their favourite sheet of ice   2t9 ,at the back side of'the long shod; and Elly set watching the sorrowful looks of Ponto, -whilst she dreamed, for the twentieth time, of. the joy which she. would experience in- visiting the home of her -mother and sisters Ponto, becoming tired of this restraint, marched slowly about the roiom, and comn- menced scratching at somnething under the secre- tary. "Ponto, come here!" Not heeding this command, he intently tugged away at something which appeared to be wedged -in between -the house and desk. In a few momtnelts he- pulled out a letter, and carried it in his mouth :t!o Elisiner. After a little qutiet coaxing, she succeeded in taking   it from  him. It had evidently been opeontd, then slightly resealed. Elly was sutprised when, glancing at the super- seription, she found it to be that of her Aunt Pvrone. -Hi-re it was, atld no ntistake!  What could it mean f The dog had torn tihe envelope slightly, so that a portion of the contents protrudedl from the paper, Elly saw these wortls :- "Byron, persevere! I am still your friend." TPis single seentencc(1-no thing more. It is true- that it was mnerely an assurance of continued friellldr ship yet a colt, clammy sweat gatheredi upon the brow of Elfisiner. Heretofore she hal experienced A morbil fear that her aunt had designs upon herg what they were, she did not know. She liad never been able to anlalyze the conduct of he:r aunt.

Mrs. Lenson had arisen, and was now placing the tea-kettle over the fire. Elisiner thought it proba- ble that she should return home at three o'clock. Elbur said :- t hWillie has played with me, and now he shall eat with me." Willie needed not much coaxing to accede to this proposition of the merry Elbur's. Mae afternoon was unusually fine for March, so Elisiner was determined to make as mutch of it as Possible. After Mrs. Lenson had extorted a promise that Mies Amelia and herself would" spend soln evening with her, during her daughter's absence. Elly bade her friendst good afternoon," and left tile house in company with the boys; when both together beseiged-their friend to take just one peep at their skating ground. -She was just turning around the corner of the shed, when a large flock of snow-birds gently cut throughi the air over her head; then alighted upon a point of elevation close by. Never tired of watching the moveinents of these airy little creatures, she approached the place where they were, so near that she could easily watch their happy glee. They flitted from one point to another, until Elly found herself not far from the old garrison, which was located upon an elevated piece of ground. She paused ; hesitating whether to proceed onward, Or to turn her course back towards home, when a fit of lonliness and enthusiastic fervor stole o'er her, and she moved forward with quiek steps. There was something about this old place that attracted our young friend. Lone, undisturbed study and con- templation, was a luxury to her. HA brown study," Kate Lenson called it,   221 The sun was still in the clear blue sky; it would be some tilne before lie would drop behind the western hills. It has been observed that our heroine possessed a spice of love for the marvellous. Her mind was continually threading its march to some place of mystery; and no placel had ever occupied a greater share of- her thoughts -than the old grey house on the hill. She had listened to many a quaint legend in regard to it, from Old Phil and aunt Nell. She proceeded forward, to the place of attraction, and enters its lonely precincts. There she stands in a room which was once,- doubtless, the " place of all work." How very high the sky-lights are! a few of the diamond-shaped panles still remtain unbroken. And now she fancies that Indians are skulking in   e the adjacent forest, and even near the time-blackened walls of the old fort. Now a signal is given for an attack upon some stray scout who is returning, per- haps, from the very fires of the enemy's camping ground, to this same garrison, the bearer of iinpor- tant discoveries. Now she fancies herself solBe maid of the dark   forest. But stop!. Have the tawny sons of the same dark   woods really returned? What sounds are those proceeding from yonderroom? Hark! again and again is heard the same sound. H the  red foe really marched about the high grey ilk s to the old garrison? But that was not an Indian's whoop! List! a groan;: as though the heart's fountain had burst its limits, and the pent-up bitter waters were deluging the waste grounds once blooming about the citadel of life. May some kind, unseen Hand   protect' the lone maid! Another groan-long, aand deep and human! Elly stands-as though her breath were suspended: not a muscle movyg.   Noiw she moves towards the door from  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7571-00000111"/> 222 whence she made her first egress; but lo! the door has closed; doubtless from the wind sweeping through the building. The first instinct of mankind is to flee when dan- ger is at hand; especially an unseen danger. Had an object of commiseration openly, and at once, appeared to the view of our young friend, she would not have hesitated for a moment to render immediate assistance. She was in the act of letting herself down through an aperture in the old stonewall, When  a tottering door was slowly opened. Her flight was not impeded, but her heart and eye arrest- ed by the appearance of an aged man, whose counte- nance was as pale as death, his form attenuated, gar- ments tattered, and every movement feeble and dejected. In a hollow voice, the pale stranger com- menced speaking. A confused mass of thoughts ran through the mind of the spell-bound girl. Should she not flee? What if he were some arch villain in disguise? What if a murderer? Oh, horrible thought! Vague suspicions flashed through her bewildered brain. Summoning to her aid a remark- able degree of composure, she said:- Sir, your appearance is truly sorrowful; if that which'you have airmed is true, you shall receive speedy assistance." A short time elapsed ere our gentle, but energetic firl was at the mansion, in private conference with her benevolent uncle. Her feet had not been tardy in threading up the snow-path. Afterwards, a few words were hurriedly whispered into the ears of the tately Mrs. Pyrqne, by the amiable husband; what- ever they might have been, they caused a furious contortion of hei features. Elisiner conversed a few moments with Amelia; Benson was hurried to the stable, horse and sleigh was soon waiting at the back A1tl   223 door, and the deacon and Elisiner were soon seated therein, and were soon flying as rapidly as the uneven ground would admit, over the road to the old garrison. Miss Amelia and Old Nell were activelyemployed in the garret, Old Phil hastened up and down, with armful after armful of wood, followed by little Sally with a basket of dried chips. Stop, your running  Sail!" shouted Madame Pyrone. "What in this world are you all flying over the house, for? Some new freaks of Elly's and her uncle's, I presume!" Buts Sally was soon out of hearing, at the heels of honest Phil. The cot-bed was trundled up near to the blazing fire, and blankets were hung up to warm, whilst soft, dry flannels, and soap and water were placed near on a stand. "They have come, sick man and all!" whispered Sally. The invalid stranger was assisted up the long stairs by the deacon and Phil. It was dark; and darkness renders a sad object still more sorrowful. The man groaned, but some hot tea and cordials soon restored him. Long did the good deacon, Miss Amelia and Elisiner, watch over the cot of the inva- lid. Soon he fell into a quiet slumber, and the watchers retired. It was near two o'clock.' The wind moaned among the tall pines near the house. Benson and Phil were now supplying the place of first watchers. Benson had fallen asleep. Phils great eyes had, for a long time, been painfully vivid to the working features of the sick man. He muttered incoherently. Phil exclaimed:- "De Lor' hab marcyfi us all! Benson wake up  -;  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7571-00000112"/> 224 de poor man be dying, sartain! Oh, de Lor' bress his poor soul!" murmured Phil reverently. Benson shook off the hold that sleep had taken of his tired frame; the deacon was summoned, and the girls The back of the dying man was supported, and he seemed to be more comfortable. Amelia stood at one end of the room, and Phil followed her, saying:- "'se been watching dat ole drum wh'gh hangs dar,-the one, Miss 'Mely which I told you bout de oder day,-and I see it moving." "Oh yes, I remember honest Phil; I promised I would see about it the next morning, but forgot it at the time." The drum  was now take' down, and a nest of young mice were found snugly esconced within, one end of the drum having been knocked out. The Africans are a superstitious race, and Phil had believed he had witnessed something supernatural. Soon the dying man was surrounded by his friend's, when he uttered a few hollow words:- "I am dying. I must tell all before I die. God has forgiven me, I trust." He took a paper from the inside of his tattered vest. The deacon took it from his emaciated hand. The bed-clothes were gently pulled about his arms and neck, hot flannels applied to his feet, and a little cordial administered. In a few moments he seemed restred; as is often the case before the taper of life finally dies away. Slowly pointing with his finger to Elisiner, he slowly said :- "My angel deliverer! who saved me from a lone death, when I was nigh freezing; and Starvation was gnawing upon my vitals, I must have died of thirst ere this, had it Snot been for her kindness. Thanks to a great God! Throug I is mercy this angel was  ecytisage a   225 sent to my relief. He sent these friends who have sustained me thus far!" A pause; when he added :- ( These papers might have been lost, and a human being perished thereby; an innocent madt1 too!" Noticing the countenances of his audience, he added: "These papers explain all. An innocent man must be delivered of the cruel charge laid upon his name. Then turning to Elisiner, he said:- "* This sweet face reminds me of-of-Oh God! I am dying-dying! Farewell, kind friends!" One faint struggle, a quiver of the eye-lids, and the stranger's soul had passed away. The sun was nearly an hour high, when a knock was heard at the door; upon opening it, Major Elwell was found without. "I called, Nell, to see how your master was getting along; also to enquire how the sick stranger is, as Elbur informed me that such a one was here." "Walk in, major!" Just now the deacon, hearing a strange voice, came forward to greet the major. A few low, earnest words were spoken, when the major entered, at Dea- con Pyrone's invitation. One hour was sufficient for the perusal of these papers left by the strange gen- tleman. They must have contained   something important, for the major arose, then sat down again; then paced the room, the sweat coursing drop after drop, down his neck and face. The ladies were then called, and after a few moments conversation, the major bade them all a hasty farewell, and proceeded directly to his sister's sage. EHe said but little to  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7571-00000113"/> ,her; and after a suddenly-dispatched breakfast, took his leave. The next day the stranger was interred within the little rustic cemetary. Meantime the garret was well aired.,*and the fire place cleared of brands and ashes by considerate Allnt Nell and black Phil. A new supply of pines were brought for the fire placQ, and every thing set in order. Mrs. Pyrone harshly observed that she did not intend to have her house turned into a hospital again very soon. But where is our friend Major Elwell?  Readers, ,we shall find himn-in the log cabbin between the twin hills, near the Saco. What is he doing there? It must be something of consequence, for here we fild Alfred Leighton, the hermit trapper, and our pale, interesting stranger, whom the reader will Hernember. Here we find him once more, the saume innocent, injured man, accused of committing a foul murderr. See himn start! hands clasped-then raised towards heaven. What can it mean?    Surely somethin u of a momentous nature, to cause such intense emotion among our friends at the mansion, and at the log cabin between the twin hills. Reader, doubtless you will remember reading in a previous chapter how  this pale gentleman was once walking along the banks of the Connecticut, when -he fell into the company of a certain individual with whom   he had once claimed a slight acquaintance, whilst travelling; at that time he had performed the ,operation of setting a disjointed limb for said gen- tleman. But- now he had nerly forgotten the event, -until circumstance threw jhJe} together once more on the banks of said rivef They had conversed on various topics, and the disjointed limb was introduced, when   several gentlemen -rode leisurely along the margin of the riyer tow' the place where they   227 were talking, and the man in company with our stranger friend suddenly ejaculated :- "Aleavens! it is Evans i He shall die!" A   report from a pistol followed to remark, resounlding through the woods. As se  smoke cleared away, the pale gentleman stood alone, with the pistol lying only a few feet from him. He was instantly seized by the other two gentlemen who were in company with the fallen man. Of course Jis innocence availed nothing; he was tried, and condemnied to expiate his supposed guilt on the gal- lows. At length he made his escape, and had been hunted from one place to another until the day that Elisiner met him in the lane, when returning from the Frenchwoman's.  The reader knows with what adroitness our kind friend replied to the officer, to shield this poor haunted man. But here the ques- tion ariseth in the minds of the readers: ( Where and how did the fugitive secrete himnself, so as to evade the officers, until he found refuge with Alfred Leighton?" He had found safety and peace within the old gar- rison; and to this place had the major conveyed food to him, whilst visiting his sister at the little brown cottage. It was he who had sent the letter to Elisi- nier; and he-was secreted in the bottom of the sleigh on the morning when Major Elwell took his depart- ure from the cottage, when he met Byron Lenson in the road, and called on him to know if he were not going to bid him good-bye. They were then on their way to the Twin Hills. But what induced the man to fire at the gentleman on horseback?  Reader, our three friends are dis-*  : cussing that very matter, in the little log cabin.. The papers that have caused such a commotion are : ::l'?- lying, upon the rude tabb. The words found upon' l:  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7571-00000114"/> 228 the scroll left by the dying stranger, ran as follows: "Some years since, I became acquainted with a pure young girl, and we were intending soon to be united in larriage, when I was obliged to leave my home for Hiile to attend to business for a widowed aunt. When I returned, I found that a rival had so ingratiated himself into the good graces of my affi- anced, that they had eloped, and were now married. I saw my first and only love but once afterwards, and then heard how her hualb and had falsely repre- sented me to her, and also that it was against her will that she had married the wretch; that she had twice tried to effect an escape. "' AftQtwards I learned that she was dead. Yes, poor Eunice died she was free from her oppressor. I made an oath that he should die, too. I kept that oath. I have hunted him, though I never came near enough to kill him, until one day when I espied him in company with others on horseback. At the time I was talking with a gentleman with whom I was- but slightly acquainted, yet enough so to know that he was an honorable person, I saw my foe, fired, then throwing my pistol from me, secreted myself within a covert densely secluded by branches. I was settling my body behind the foliage, when my companion was arrested as the murderer of my vic- tim. I heard him protest his innocence, when my pistol was brought forward to prove his guilt. "I have led a miserable life; but it has not been so miserable since I have come to a full detelmina- tion to search out the innocent man, suffering through my guilt. I have traced him to this spot. Oh God! e may he be spared a-cruel, unjust death!" A few days after the interment of the stranger, ;^ the Pyrone family were summoned to the court room R in------ , where it was sow proved satisfactory to   229 all, that an innocent man had been almost miracu- lously saved from an ignominious death. Meantime, Mrs. Hovert had received a letter from hler son Lawrence, wherein he- had sttg d many strange things. One was concerning a cafthat had' been impending for a long time, relative to a man's escaping from justice as a supposed murderer. He had been convicted upon circumstantial evidence, but was now acquitted. Elisiner had previously written home that she must postpone her visit uutil Clarence Nervouarn returned from A----.  Whilst the Pyrones were attending court, Widow' Iovert was journeying towards the home of her sis. ter Beatrice, at l'yrone Mansion. She found this lady muttering, as usual, about something which she fancied had golle wrong with her. Notwithstanding this, Lady Pyrone was pleased to see her amiablid sister, with her beautiful twins Annette and Lurnette." Even her smile was sunny, and her voice tempered with kindness. The days were passed in pleasant' conversation between the sisters. The garret had   worn an appearance of gloom; since the death of the stranger. NotwitlhstandingC this, the. twins could not refrain from enjoying an occasional game in it. :The ages of the twins, Eibur' Lenson- and Willie Fosdick'varied but little; the lads were but a few months the elder. The snow was daily disappearing before the sun, which was now much higher since the dark, sterner days. 20  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7571-00000115"/> CHAPTER XIV. Later one afternoon, in the early part of April. the children ran in from the corn barn, exclaiming:- Oh mother! there s company coning up to the old gate." The next moment there was a shaking of hands, and introductions between strangers. There was Ma- jor Elwell, Mr. Hovert, and another a still greater stralger. Elisiner whispered to her mother:- "Mother, that tall, handsome gentleman calls his name ' Hovert.' Can he be any relation of our's?" By this time Mrs. Hovert was shaking hands with this interesting gentleman. Who can depict the am- iable widow's astonishment and delight in meeting the youngest brother of her husband His counte- nance seemed familiar to he:, at the first moment when she saw him standing amidst the group of friends in the dining-room. Yes, reader this is the same man whom we heard lamenting his fate in the old log cabin between the ttin hills. You will recollect how in his soliloquy, he mentioned the name of his oldest brother ; also the name ' Laura,' as being his earliest and only love. But his brother stepped in and blasted the young laan's hopes, and Laura. not suspecting that she was an object of inte'rest to Orvian Hovert, married the elder brother. *e   231 Orvian was only three months older than herself; she had always esteemed him as a noble youth, and sle regreted it extrenlely, when her husband inforim- ed her that he had gone to reside abroad. It was now twenty-six years since she had seen him. And now he stood before her. After supper the large bible was brought forth and a portion of the good words read by Miss Amelia; then a prayer offered up by the good dacon, which was followcd by a loud " amen!" from Major Elwell. Ttie next day Lady Pyrone remarked to her sis- ter:- "Oh, Laura, how much I like Orvian Hovert! so much better than I ever did his elder brother." "Perhaps you would not, Beatrice, had he bestowed so many good-lnatured jokes upon you as my husband Was wont to do." ," We will not dispute that point now, Laura; you know Bernard and myself never could agree very well." Elber went up to the mansion in the forenoon, with the titdilgs of Kate's return. Elisiner was very much pleased to hear it; hut she needed but little to add to her happiness, whilst her mother and sisters were here, and Lawrence was daily expected by his friends. However slte stole a few moments from the society of loved ones, and ran down the hill to the brown cottage. Kate, catching a glimpse of her friend, ran to meet her, and in a few moments more they were firmly locked in one another's arms. At one o'clock on the next day, Elbur was dispatched to the mansion with word that a goodly company would soon be with them,. Why! who can they be?" eagerly exclaimed half a dozen at once. "Have patience," cried Elbur, "and you will learn soon enough."  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7571-00000116"/> 232  : Very soon the manly tones of Lawrence fell upon the ear of the fond, doting mother. "How do I find my dear mother?" at the same time imprinting a kiss upon her cheek. "My son, how happy we are to see you!" After the first salutations, a bustle was heard ia another part of the room. "Why Clarence, when did you arrive?" And indeed this was a pleasant gathering. All1 Were indefatigable in their endeavors to make one dnother happy. By chance, Clarence had met Lawrence whilst trav- eling, when both had proceeded immediately to the home of the latter; but finding all save Almina (who had been left to keep house in her mother's absence) gone, they mutually agreed to follow the family to the Pyrone mansion. One day the newly-found uncle was sitting alone Pith Elisiner, when Mrs. Iovert entered the room and found them apparently deeply engrossed in conversa- lion.  Elisiner remarked:- "Oh uncle, how I have pondered upon that mys- tery!                   ." She slipped a gold ring from her finger, as the -tncle arose and approached his niece, with a deep, 'Sweet smile, (peculiar to the H*erts.) as be said :- '*Does my  pet niece think that the poor, grey- liaired man, whom she sawlweary and desolate in the green lane, is in any way connected with the gold ring? or rather, connected with the mystery which dwells with the beautiful trinket. Elisiner started, a light like a meteor flashed through her brain, leaving a faint glimmering of the truth. She felt as though she were about to fly from off the craggy rock of conjecture, where she bad long att in a state of bewilderment, viewing the summits of unravelled mysteries.   283  (I will leaveyou in company with your motlher, Elly, to retire to yonlder apartment; but I will not keep you in sus8lense long. The uncle withdrew. IMeanwhile Mrs. Hovere male her (aughter acquailnted with many facets of her unclde's lifet, the knowledgtle of which opened a new channel of interest in her heart for thi s worthy rela- tive. Yet her mnind was ill at ease, until additional light should be thrown upon the mysteries which she hadl so long tried to solve The door opened, and the self-same desolate, weary manl whhotn Elisiner had elcountered and assisted in the lane, made his appearance. Her heart leaped with joy and thanksgiving to the Great Deliverer. "But dear uncle, how did you fare after our part- ing in the green lane?" "After leaving you, I repaired immediately'to the rock which you mentioned as a place of security, remaininglS there several days, eating nothing except wild fruit wlhich grew in the immediate vicinity of the rock. But Elly, I must not omit mentioning one thing which hadl I done it, would inevitably have thrown me into the hands of my pursuers." 'V What is it?" asked Mrs. -Hovert. It was the furious barking of a dog, and indistinct voices of numerous persons, as I emerged from my retreat to an opening in the woods. I plainly des- cried a scene which made my heart leap wildly. It- was you, Elisiner, in danger from a fierce dog." "So uncle you witnessed that scene?" "Yes, dear girl, and a fear of discovery never en- tercel my mind when I saw you in such eminent peril." "Noble brother of my departed husbandt" ex- claimed Mrs. Hovert. "You might have seen me with a club had yeO  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7571-00000117"/> 234 looked behind. At that moment you dealt a lusty low at the brute, and I moved not until I was con- vinced that he was killed, and you were out of dan- ger. Then came a shout from a noble looking lad, who had his person -mutilated by the teeth of the dog, shouting the praises of his beautiful deliverer." Both ladies spoke in thankful terms of the happy Crisis; of the saving of the petted kid, and the res- cue of Elbur Lenson. The uncle spoke in praises ot the good people who had showed their appreciation - of his niece's noble nature, by making her appropri- ate presents. "But dear uncle, we are all impatience to learn your fate after your return into the forest." The uncle turned towards Mrs. Hovert, saying:- Laura, you will doubtless remember hearing your husband mention something concerning a relative who resided near the seaside. Thither did I repair, ihe dark night favoring my expedition; never falter- ing in my determination to preserve my own life iunder all circumstances. I arrived at my place of destinai tion in safety, and was assailed but once before reach- ing the place. After emerging fron some trees, a couple of ruffians approached me, and in a threaten- ing tone demanded me to give my name. Now ladies hear how I foiled them. I answered': ' As to that, sars, I be ole Ned Scapegood, known asa wood -chopper, in these parts, at your sarvice, with a ludicious borw. "* Well,' said one of the ruffians to the other, in a low tone, ' I verily believe him to be an honest fool.' "Then stepping towards me, he said:-," "' Well old dough-head, have you any paper or pewter about your carcass?" " Why, as to that,' says I, 'I guess I have; some eidipapers a man jes? gin me at 'tother end, t the Wood, auud two pewter buttons.'   235 "t And I pulled out an old newspaper which had held bread and cheese, a few hours before, and passe" it to the men. "' ( You old wrinkled fool! we don't want your con- founded old ginger-bread I All of your old brains could be held in a nutshell.' "The sudden sound of carriage wheels on the road caused the ruffians to flee towards the woods. In their haste they left behind them a pistol and amu- nition. I secured these, and made for the sea-shore: with all the precipitancy imaginable." "d And did you find the relative?" 4"I did, and presented myself to his charity as a poor lone man, seeking employment. I lived with him some time; even until his death. :"Perhaps, Laura, yot would like to learn some. thing regarding the eccentricities :of your honered relative." :rt Indeed I should," replied Mrs. Hovert. ' It will afford me- pleasure, dear readers, to giv6 you some events in the life of a worthy man. In a retired snuggery near old father ocean, lived Jedediah Liscom. He had some twenty yearas stice retired from the world in utter disgust at' its base- ness. At this period he was about 'forty-five. His ,only companion was an  accomplished daughter. After she had attained a marriageable age, her hand. was sought and won by one who afterwards proved a worthless adventurer. After her marriage she ac- eompanied her husbanid to the west. The father was- wretched at his idolized Alice's departure; his lone. lintess was too insupportable to be bourne. Receiving much insolence frotm his creditor's about this time, as well as various heavy losses, he left the world of bas- tie, and led an active life on the ocean, for a short lime. , - -          -  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7571-00000118"/> 286 Perhaps, Laura," continued the uncle, "you and Elly would like to listen to the experiences of one dark stormy night?" "Yes, we should." "This night was one of inky darkness ; one calcu- lated to inspire dread and terror. The- howlings of old Neptune, mingled with the mourning wind ; and creak of branches and heavy limbs, was etnough to thrill aint hearts, and make even stout ones quake. But I experienced little fear; for they could not equal the elements of man's passions and the warring com- motions that I had battled with long ere the night in question. A low door led from the apartment where we were sitting to a back entrance; all beyond was impenetrable darkness. Suddenly there came a sound as that of one trying to effect an entrance. The sound grated unpleasantly on my ear, as I sat with my old uncle, brooding over my fate; all within as dark and tempestuous as the -warring elements without. I was soon left alone, as my aged friend retired for the night. A rumor had gone forth among the gossips of L ----, that Captain Jedidiah Liscom  possessed immense wealth. But where he kept his property was a mystery yet to be solved. -Many a dark stormy night, when the loud roar of the ocean, and the wind's wierd shrieking was heard about the low abode of this old sea veteran, have I listened to its dying moans sweeping through the trees, fancying, ever and anon, that the sound was like the wailings of some human in distress. "Upon just such a night as the one that I have described, my uncles was reclining upon a low couch, apparently in a deep reverie, when he aroused himself and thus- addressed me: "' Well, old b,y, what do you think of the appear- ance of things, hereabouts?"   237 , 4 Really sir, I do not thhink that I comprehend your meanintg sufficiently to give' you a correct an- swer. ,' Well then, to cut the matter short, some years ago I was a regular old salt, lovi1ng to brave the wild storms at sea, and a real lover of the sublimities of old Father Neptune. But in my wanderings wipon the tossing treacherous bosom of the deep, I neve' came in contact with half as many voracious sharks, as I have upon terra-firma. On one of my voyages across the Atlantic, I met with something of a mo- mentous character which has governed my life since. Starting from Boston, in my good ship 'Speedwell,' bound for Liverpool. I will not tarry with the mi- nute details of said voyage ; suffice it to say, my boy, that I did not return to these parts for several years. During mny absence, I visited sunny Spain. Here- tas Itaken ill; insomuch that I was rendered unable to set sail again. The first mate took my place, and I remained behind. When I had partially recovered, a proud Spanish damsel bestowed her bright, bewitch- ing glances upon my humble self. 6 The speaker heaved a deep sigh as he cast a side- long glance towards the cracked mirror; doubtless at the ravages which time had get-upon his once fine form and face. , , Perhaps you will wonder when I say that I was once considered a handsome man, though somewhat rough. Many a proud Spaniard coveted my notice; But I must not render an old yarn more tiresome to a young man.' , Imagine my feelings, Laura, when he gave me a scrutinizing glance, which caused the warm blood to rush to my face; but I consoled myself with- t-hi thought that my mask would serve as a proeation t for he had not yet recognized the relative whom hie  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7571-00000119"/> 288 had befriended. I ahemmed carelessly, but perctived that all was not so secret as I wishel tlnat it mlilight be. I instantly concluded that if suspected of play- ing an assumed part, I would throw myself upoll thl melcy of the old gentleman.  After a somewhat lengthened pause he continuedl :- "' I hait at this time contracted a relihl for gam- bling. My boy; shaking me by the shoulder, 'you klnow nothing of the alluring temptations which beset mne. Every species of gaimblinl is dlcretlory to genuine happiness, anti the influelnces diIre ful. Timet wore apace. \Ve are not always the contrMoleTrs of our affections. In due tilne I foulnd thalt 1o coalx- ing from the tilled mlaid of sunnty Spain couldl call forth one heart throb of minle in response. My lheart's earnest devotion had goie, forth- ,;ot to the wealthy, but the pure, beautiful dlaulghter of a huln-  blo, but worthy artloner. Happily f;or me, my l(ovo was fondly reciprocated. We were united inl a little rustic chapel by good father Eluis. We set saill ftor America, without one tear froin mny young lrite at leavinr her father land.'  * Upon arriving at Boston, I had considerable business to attend to. After soine preilismlinaries I fountl myself again aboard my tship. Whilst ash ore 1 could not forgo the pleasure of frequlenlting tile galning table. Between my winin(r process at, thll table, and my successful trips, I soion becalne unle4kni- ably rich. At length--and I grieve to say irt- colmenleced using ardent spirits to such a dlgret that I was compellted to leave the sea altogether. My wife became aware how matters stood.

Some of my debtors turned bank- rnpts long before the blow fell upon nme. A maide, cousin came here, making it her home until within one year of the elopement of my idolized Alice with that knavish adventurer. Tile fellow had been look- ing about Boston and Newhuryport some time, when he saw my beautiful child, and decoyed her fromu her home. I pursued the wretch, and ascertained that they had been legally united in the ties of matri. mony. My heart was nearly broken. But I naust hasten to the end of my sad history. My situation in life had now become irlsome and lonely in a high degree.'   "Here he made a long pause. I assured him of my heart-felt sympathy, for which he thanked me kind. ly, saying he was rejoiced to know that he had one sincere friend, although he was comparatively a stranger. I enquired ;Do;people still think that you possess wealth?' "es,' he replied, 'there are some of that class, reho firmly assert that I am a miser, and hoard up an immense amount of money. Sometimes tlpy even have the insolence to taunt me about starving my family. It is horrible! but my  roud spirit ill Iever condescend to argue with this heartless mass of humanity.' "' Well sir,' I said with pity, 'I would try to dis- miss these painful thoubglts. There is a Judge who, one day, I trust, will bring the guilty to see and con- less their guilt, and soothe the anguished mind.' 'Ah ' sighled the wretched man, 'the cruelty of reckless men has cast a deadening blight over the happiness of the innocent.' "Here, forgetting the part that I was playing, I i    nvoluntarily' exclaimed :.   241 "' A wretched man am Itoo!' "And in the agony of the moment I raised my hand to my head, clenched at my hair, pulling so eagerly that my wig came down with full force to the floor. By this time my senses rushed back. My old friend arose with a convulsive start, looking from my face to the dislodged wig in blank amazement. Discovery was inevitable. I gave a concise, but sat- isfactory account of the events which had transpired, not even withholding my real name. He groaned, then arose and approached me; when he traced that I was alrelative, he shook my hand in right good earnest. "BWt Laura, I fear that both you and Elly will tire before I conclude this narrative." "Oh no, we shall not. Pray proceed! we are much interested in your recital." "( Well then. The winds were howling, and a chilly wind was blowing, though the month of the year was August. I stirred the coals, and lighted nmy uncle's pipe, and the smoke played many a circlet around his white locks and beard. "Well, my nephew.' he continued, 'you know that one sorrow seldom comes alone; though but one may appear at a time, a second is sure to appear, then a third may be lurking in the back-grrund.' Amen!' I responded. "'Thus hasit been with myself!' he continued. One cold, stormy day towards even-tide, a low knock at the door reached my ear. At the time I was engaged in reading the Bible, and a sweet tide of consolation swept its cooling waters over my toil-tossed soul. As I arose to open the door, I heard a sob, and the name father' pronounced in a low falteriqg tone. - Ah! how it thrilled my. soul! It was my long-lost daughter Alice. Her husband- had deserted her; 21  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7571-00000121"/> 242         ' her infant son had soon winged its flight back to our 8aviour's arms, and the miserable mother had received aid from poor but worthy neighbors, until her health enabled her to travel. She had with unyielding per- severance accomplished her journey, and she is now at rest by the side of her angel mother, and since that time I have lived alone, with visits now and then from a few kind sensible persons, who gave little, or no credence to the prevailing gossip. "'However, there is one person who visits here, whose company I would willingly dispense with. I refer to the tall, dark nan who comes here'oftenest when the night is long and dark. I feel a dread- of him, yet I dare not offend him by doing otherwise than countenancing his visits. I am a lone man as you know, and have limited intercourse with the world. Doubtless the fellow has intentions of his own concerning me, for I am confident that he thinks I have money secreted in this house.' ' I voluntarily vowed that I would frustrate the villian's designs. And now ladies, I will speak of the events of the stormy night in question. "The wind continued as it had commenced, and its howling and piteous moanings increased the lonli- ness of the night. I proposed that my friend should retire, and I would, if he desired it, remain up. He was arriving at the conclusion that it was best, when a low knock was heard at the outside door. Botl of us sprang instantaneously to our feet. / I demanded the name of the person who sought admittance at this unseasonable hour of night. "' A friend,' was the bland reply. "'A friend to whom?' I again demanded. "'A friend to Captain Liscom. I aln neighbor Cummings.' ," Whether the force of the wind turned the but-   243 ton, or not,- I cannot say; but he affected an entrance, by thrusting his dark head into the apartment, whilst- the rest of his ugly form followed. Going directly up to the old man, he asked who he had with him. The old gentleman answered that it was an old friend. Certainly my appearauce was rather odd just now. At this time my muscular frame was untrammelled, and the least signs of abuse towards my old friend would have been a signal to put these powers in action. "' Why,' said the man, in apparent astonishment, ' I thonughlt that this man-' "' Well! demanded the old gentleman. ,(' Nothing, only I thought that I saw him down at the wharf, ready to take one of the steamers; so I thought that it must be bad for you to be here all alone on such a night as this.' "' Very kind of you, sir, but have no fears: my, life has been tempestuous, and its waves too turbulent to become awed at nature's stormy elements. ,", Well, you are a brave old fellow,' sneered the dark man. "At this time the fire was emitting very little light; scarcely enough for the present case, I thought, so I heaped on more wood. I acted the part of a poor ignorant imbecile. You know, Laura, that brother Bernard used to say that I was a complete mimic." "Yes, Orviah, I know that your mimicing powers are great." "Well, I left the apartment a moment on the pre- tence of securing a light, I found a brace of pistols which I hid beneath my frock, ready for use at an instant's warning. The light plainly revealed the dark, frowning countenance of our neighbor, and the anxious expression on that of my aged friend. "( This is a terrible night, ' remarked Cummings, "for the rich as well as poor.'  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7571-00000122"/> 244 ,'The eyes of the man and my own now met in one long, searching gaze. What the wretch saw in nly scrutinizing glance, could not have been very flatter- ing, for he quailed beneath it, and soon took his de- parture. "A few days after, my old friend motioned me to his bedside. Raising himself, he bade Ime go to his secretary, and take therefrom a small packet, and an iron box, wherein were four tiny bars of gold. Here was all his wcalthl, he told mne, and these were relics of the days when his coffers were well filled. He had treasured them in the sacred remembrance of his sainted wife, who had often said that there seenmed to be something magical about them. Byv placing the fine point of a penknife upon a tiny spring at one side of the box, a small shelf was discovered con- taining some exquisite jewelry. These jewels had once belonged to the departed lady. He said: "' I have a strong presentiment that I shall not survive long. To me, life has been a morbid dream, until the sweet angel of mercy visited my soul, through the instrumentality of my own sainted wife. The waters of my life, once turbid, are now swelled by hope and unshaken faith in my Saviour:' "He seemed to fall off into a dreamy slumber, as he concluded these words. Upon awakening, I prom- ised that I would not desert him, though I hoped that his present fears were groundless. Indeed, I thought that they were, as he had often experienced similar attacks. He composed himself to sleep, after taking a soothing cordials I sat long alone on this eve: even until evening was falling into the bosom of night. I was dreaming of the days of my child- hood and youth, when my reverie was unceremon- iously broken by an unusual noise at the back side of the house.   245 I placed myself behind a screen, and whilst I dlil sl ; though it was the work of a momedt, the inlltuder unfastened the outer door; owing, as I supposed, to some neglect of mine in leaving the door thus. Then the door opened slowly, and the would-be assa^- sin crept cautiously into the room, crouching like a tiger, and muttering to himself meanwhile. "Gold! gold! hist! the miser sleeps, and though that pretended cripple is no fool, yet I do not fear him. They both must die!" "My old friend slept soundly. The villian opened his dark lantern, and peered cautiously about with- oat rising from his crouching posture; then arose, and setting his lantern upon the floor, was in the act of unbuttoning his coat, when, as quick as light- ing, I sprang from my hiding-place and dealt a severe blow upon the man' s thick skull. He reeled, then raised both hands to his head. I never once quitted my post but stood looking at him. He made an awkward thrust towards his side-pocket. I. sprang foward, planting my right knee fully and flatly in his stomach. He fell with a crash, and gave one or two convulsive twitches. "At this juncture I heard the voice of my old friend, crying out in terror. Doubtless the fall had awakened him. I hastened to his apartment, and found him sitting'up, peering wildly about. Ap- proaching,.I endeavored to quiet his alarm. " Oh nephew,' he said in a husky voice, ' after you left me I slept so sweetly, and I dreamed that I saw my angel wife; yes, and my dear Alice, too! Their mild,-loving eyes rested pleasantly upon me. - But methought I could not reach thlm, for a deep, though narrow river rolled between us. White wings gathered about me, as though they fain would wrap me up, and bear me away. But no! a horrible sight  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7571-00000123"/> 246 opened to my vision, as the loved ones passed away. A dreaded foe came near and fixed his malignant eye upon me. Hte boent over me, and whispered fear- ful words, when I observed that it was Cummings. Methought an upraised knife glittered over my head; and that you, my nephew, saved me from the ;assassin.' "' Yes,' I said, as soothingly as I was able, 'rest assured that nothing shall harm you whilst I can prevent.' "I knew not but that the truth of his dream would be realized, whilst the ruffian was yet so near. But no' there he lay in the passage, a ghastly corpse. It was a desperate case, but self-defence is one of nature's laws. At early morn I took the proper means for investigating the deed, though it required trivial attention. Cummings had been a wicked per- son. 1 learned that a year before he -had been released from prison, and since he had been prowling about Boston and that vicinity. Implements of death were found concealed about his person. My rusty sailor's costume saved me from discovery, so complete was the disguise. "In a few weeks wnore my old friend -was laid by the side of his wife and daughter. Once I passed by my uncle's fine estate, near High Rock. The walls flat, and girded the entire domain. Lofty ornaimen- tal, and forest trees grew in stately grandeur down to the water's edge. I took this stroll at early dawn, whilst the morning sun threw its illumination over the distant waters. The dim outlines of the build- ings towered against the sky." ' But Uncle Orvian, what became of those bars of 5 gold?"  "They are still in my possession: I hold them as i acred relics of my old friend.'   247 "And where did you go after your uncle's death?' A sad smile played over the uncle's fine counte' nance, as he said :--9 ,( When I first met you in the green lane, Elly, your appearance reminded me rather forcibly of one, whom I had, in late years, highly esteemed. You will remember how my gaze was fastened upon you?" "Oh yes, dear uncle; also of the wild- whirl of undefincable thought which passed through my mind at that time." ( No mother and child ever bore a more striking resemblance to each other than that which exists between you, Laura, and your daughter. I cannot give any definite reason why my steps, in the first place, led me up the green hills of New Hampshire unless it was some magnetic attraction, combined with some vague remembrance of a dilapidated garrison, located on an elevation somewhere in this vicinity. "After leaving my uncle's old home, I wandered about for some time, finally finding an asylum with an aged widow, for whom I performed sundry offices in return for my board. My life was fast becoming very irksome. Death seemed far preferable to the miserable dogged life that I was leading. Then, by good fortune I was led to the spot where I first beheld you, Elisiner. Afterwards I met with Major Elwell; who, though a stranger, interested himself in my behalf, after I had given him the history of my woes. I found refuge in the old garrison until conveyed by the major to the cabin by the twin hills. Whilst here, my hours of lonliness were frequently beguiled by the perusal of some poems; your pro- ductions, I believe, Elisiner?" "But uncle, how came they in your possession?: "Oh," answered the uncle, " they were 'furnished  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7571-00000124"/> 248 me by the major, who officiated in the capacity of keeper over me." "I wish that every one had as lenient a jailor," remarked Mrs. Hovert. "I was quite ignorant at the time in regard to these poems; little dreaming that they were origi- nally written by my own brother Bernard's child." '"I was generally styled ' Miss Pyrone' at the mansion: many thinking me the daughter of the deacon, instead of his niece." "Your hours must have been solitary at the cabin, brother Orvian," said Mrs. Hovert, gently. "Yes," he answered, slowly; " yet I was not alone, for I trust that one Friend is forever with me. I had a Bible which my friend, the trapper, presented to me; and you connot conceive how great a treasure it was to. me. I trust that I have learned many of its sacred truths, never to forget them again; the same that I learned when a child, bending at my mother's knee. At twilight's hour, I learned to look upon the Bible as my best friend. Oh, childhood's years! what memories stir the dull, insipid channel of com- monalities, and sink the present events into insignifi- cance! When life floats away into chaos, nothing stands out in such vivid colors as childhood's early association!" "Well, Orvian, I am happy to know that your days at the little cabin were so profitably spent." "( Tlhjk you Laura; they were, indeed." "( Biut uncle, did you encounter any wolves whilst among the mountains?" -"Why, my little lover of all pertaining to adven- tures! I stood in no awe of mountain wolves, whilst human wolves were upon my track. But I may tell you of one thrilling adventure which 'the trapper and myself experienced, at another time, We have   249 already trespassed against the rules of politeness, in leavingr our friends for so long a time in the dining- room." "I should judge, dear uncle, that they had not all remained in the diining-rooin, but had scattered to all parts of the house, as every corner echoes the sound of mirth." Clarence reappeared at this moment, regarding the group with a mixture of joy and pain. Elisiner laid her hand gently upon his arm, saying:- "( Oh stay a moment, I want to ask my uncle one tlhing more." A"What now, little coaxer? ' "I was thinking of the poorestranger \hom I found in the old garrison." "1 What are your thoughts concerning this person, dear Elly?' "( He must have been so unfortunate!" sighed the young girl. "Ay! the wretch who fell beneath his fire received naulght save his rightful deserts. He had poisoned the existelce of this man by his diabolical treachery. He aled stolen, as it were, the onlyr woman whom he could ever love, and adding crime to crime, had shamefully treated the abused lady, until the Angel of Death had, in mercy, borne her far away from earth.." Clarence had seated himself by Elly's side. "Yes, my noble-hearted Elisiner, all that you have said relative to this sad affair is true, indeed; with the exception of the termination of his exis- tence. In time, stern justice might have been upon him, had not God kept him within His own keeping. No matter how great the offence, it is not, in the sight of God, held as a sufficient excuse for killing a fellow-being. So for once, my pet. I think that  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7571-00000125"/> 250 your interest'and sympathy for the murderer has gotten the start of .your better judgment."   "My sympathetic feelings are always plunging me into some digression;" said Elisiner half-reproach- fully. Clarence bent his head towards her, and whispered tenderly:- "Dear, sweet little advocate, we all appreciate your noble, loving, self-sacrificing nature too well to believe that you would Wyish to rob Justice of her own rightful power." A look of pure, childlike confidence into the face of Clarence was all the answer that Elisiner gave. Although this conversation was soon discontinued, Elly could not forbear thinking that the wicked abductor had met with nothing save his rightful deserts, from the hands of the suffering stranger, whom she had discovered in a dying condition in the old garrison on the hill. The trio arose, and prepared to descend the stairs, when the uncle suddenly halted, and said:- "( Now that I think of it, there is yet another explanation to make. You will remember, Laura, that you and Elisiner were wondering to whom the dying stranger alluded, when, in so touching a man- ner, he spoke of Elly's countenance." "Yes, uncle, we were m- uch surprised at such a declaration." !"'"You will remember that I met this stranger in former fqars? Olne evening, whilst sitting in our hotel, the gentleman interrupted my meditations in gazing upon a miniature before me, at the same time fixing his dark, penetrating eye upon something which he carried in his hand. Elly approached him, and saw a small but beautiful miniature of a lady, attached to a tiny cord. The doctor raised his hand,   251 still retaining the prized treasure. Elly started, and exclaimed:- "My mother! it is motmother's miniature! See!' she added taking the passive hand of her parent. It Why, Orvian! how came you in possession of this?" demanded Mrs. Hovert in surprise. "4 Sometime, I hope I may be able to answer your enquiries, dear Laura. But," he continued," as I was about to say, this man found me gazing- intently upon the life-like features of this picture, when he stepped nearer, and asked permission to view it. He soon returned it, saying that if the original were half-half-- "Half what, my uncle?" enquired Elly playfully; then added in a serious manner, as if a new revela- tion had suddenly shot across her brain :--Oh! I know; the miniature looked like my humble self, and the poor dying stranger had some vague idea that he- had seen a face before that resembled mine." i( Yes, Elly, the resemblance is striking, and I can- not wonder that the poor man observed it on behold- ing you." Mrs. Hovert had, for some reason, left the apart- ment. "( Thank you, dear uncle, for making this so expli- cit." ( Yes, Elisiner, I have endeavored to make every- thing plain. Even in my direst dilemmas have I tasted the sweets of consolation. The unbounded  : kindlnesses- of the marjor and the trapper. together with your poems, were the refreshing draughts which I have quaffed in my solitary hours with unfeigned happiness and thankfulness." Mrs. Hovert now appeared in the door-way. Elly's countenance wore an expression which was almost celestial, as the beauty of her soul always spoke through her eyes, the " windows of the soul."  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7571-00000126"/> 252 Some unexpressed thought seemed laboring to give utterance. Gatlhering fresh courage, she stepped in between her mother and uncle, and lying her hand upon the arm of the latter, said:- M My own kind uncle, mamma and myself have very much to thank you for, in thus taxing your memory, and perhaps doing violence to your feelings in the rehllearsal of so many sorrows." Well,-Ellv, I have much to thank you for in my turn, as you well know." Then turning to Mrs. iovert he added :--Laura, you may justly feel proud of such anoble girl as Elisiner. She is a real angel and I do hope,"he fervently ejaculated, " that a bright halo of undimmed happiness may henceforth shed its brilliance around her lifei's pathway; and that she may still continue to walk onward, scatterin g buds snd flowers of peace and usefulness where'er she is destined  to go! May no rude storms of adversity ever overtake her!" Ah stop! this is a fruitless wish of thine- Life's undimmed lustre is not to be Found upon this distorted globe! Ah no! The ills of life are paramount to its joys. In a few days the company would separate for the present. Lr. Hoverft, in company with Clarence, Mrs. leovert and Elisiner, left the old mansion, and started for the home of the latter. Major Elwell remained for a short time with h]is sister at the lit- tle brown cottaoe. The highly-gifted Lawrence Hovert lingered there too. A bright star attracted him, in the form of our sweet Kitty Lenson. Wil- lie and Elbur declared that it was too bad to have the beautiful twins -Annette and Lunette--go away, but the gloom on their faces was soon dispelled when Haiam Banks, together with little Hattie Williansi appeared at the mansion. Now all was very quiet   253 at the Pyrone House. Miss Amelia, it is true, was very lonely. Winter passed away, and the weather was fast becoming warmer, when the breath of early flowerets lent sweet perfume to the air. A visit from Loner Sherford was auspiciously hailed by Amelia and the good deacon. In a few days Mr. Sherford solicited the daughter's hand of the father; which was happily bestowed, though not without some paternal tears, for never was child loved with a deeper intensity than this daughter of the old deacon. There were a few long-drawn sighs from Amelia; for how could she leave her dear ancestral roof without some pain- ful thoughts? But her love for her intended part- ner was of ting phlegmatic nature. Before Mr. Sherford's departure, it was decided- that they should reside in the old garrison house, as the deacon would settle that together with the sur- rounding land, upon them. Mr. Sherford had been teaching for seven years, and his health demanded an immediate change; so it was settled that the wedding should occur sometime during the ensuing month. "Yes, my children," answered the father, "I have no objection to this arrangement, though I had not contemplated so sudden a departure." "But we are not tO part, my dearest father!' interposed Amelia. The father looked- happy sand joy danced in his eyes as he grasped the hand of his loving child. Mr. Sherford's plans were readily acceded to by father and child. It was thought best to repair the old building, so that it would answer their purposes for a short time. Dr. Hovert continued to reside with-his sister and- family. Meantime, under his care, Clarence's health- was fast improving.  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7571-00000127"/> CHAPTER XV. It was late one afternoorn near the close of April, that the members of Mrs. Hovert's pleasant family were surprised by the arrival of Byron Lenson; or rather Elwell, as he had now taken his uncle's name, and was the sole inheritor of the major's wealth. Perhaps we should not say " sole inheritor," as the major had not overlooked his only sister Henrietta, and her family. Byron was kindly received,- and his visits duly appreciated. His praises had been sung and resung by Mrs. Pyrone, whilst Mrs. Hovert was visiting at the mansion. Certainly, had the latter judged the son by the mother's excellent principles, he would have been entitled to all of the wealth of character which Airs. Pyrone lavished upon him. Byroni prolonged his stay for some time after Eli- siner would willingly have dispensed with his com- pany; not that his manners varied one iota from the set rules of propriety; but there are certain bounds within the line of decorum, and if one inch of the prohibited ground is intruded upon, the transgressor envelopes himself (or herself) within a cloud of dis- approbation, and sometimes gains a settled dislike from hitherto indulgent associates. This was the exact position that Mr. Elw'ell held.   255 He had occupied the space left him for the consum- mation of a friendly visitation, and yet he still lin- gered, seemingly meditating some plan in his own mind, whether it were best, or not, to remain until all rivals had quited the field. In fact, he seemed determined to remain until he had witnessed the departure of Clarence Nervourn, his hated rival! Meanwhile he was deceitfully playing an agreeable part towards Clarence. They visited schools together, and various other places of interest. Clarence was introduced to the rector of the place and soon gained the good favour and friendship of this gentleman. In his company he visited the poor, sick and needy. At length Byron left. Elisiner, on reflection, could detect nothing in his-demeanor- throughout his visit which was-more free, or varied in any way from the manners of any privileged friend. In fact,:Elly's kind nature was such, that even when she blamed a per- son at first, .in her after-reflections she always found some avenue for the offender's escape, without ill feelings towards him. Soon after, Clarence took his departure. Many long and weary days would elapse ere he reached his place of destination. Reader, we will not dwell upon the trials of the lovers at parting. To know that it was a bitter, bit- ter parting, is enough. Yet this, even, had one drop of sweet assurance in it; and that was the correspon- dence which was to go on between them. A letter came from Amelia, bidding Elisiner to return to her uncle's mansion if she could be spared. There was a tearful parting between mother and sis- ters, then the young girl left her home once more. Loner Sherford aud Amelia Pyrone were united in marriage on the twenty-third of May. They depar- ted for Newhuryport immediately, as Mr. Sherford  &#xD;<pb n="256 (Illustration) -257" xml:id="VAC7571-00000128"/>   257 had made new plans, which would render his presence in that place necessary, for a short time at least. Once more was the fountain of Elly's tears unfet- tered. Her friend, her counseller, was gone! How lonely did the house seem without that dear form! A gloom had suddenly o'erspread the whole place, and her uncle's health was fast failing. And above all, Clarence was gone, too! A deep sadness stole over the young girl's soul. Poor, lonely Elly! Deacon Pyrone went to town to transact certain business affairs, and it was so late when he returned home that heavy dews were falling, and he added to his already bad cough. The family physician was soon in attendance, but a lung fever soon told its own fearful story upon the good 'man's frame. Mr. and Mrs. Sherford returned to the mansion at the first iutelligence of the deacon's illness. Byron Elwell, who had now returned to the cottage, rendered all the assistance in his power; watching by the bed side of the sick man, and procuring other watchers when needed. But all endeavors of friends, and skill of physicians, proved of no avail; they could not save the good man. On the eighteenth day of July the worthy man departed from this life of worldly cares and pains. He had long been a-pilgrim, and had ever proved, himself faithful to his sacred duties. His sojourn upon the- troubled waters of life was peacefully ended. With o calm holiness he had lain down in the hope of immortality. He had passed the farthest shores of life, and the portals of Heaven were opened for his entrance therin. His vision was enraptured with unspeakable, raptur- ous glories; the hope of the dying Christian beamed in his eye. His love for Christ shed an illumina- tion about him. His dying accents were :- "Come, Lord Jesus!"  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7571-00000129"/> 258 The rustic, but beautifully-situated chapel in the dell bore the deep stamp of mourning. But oh I how sad upon this day, did the venerable clergyman arise, and with tremulous language, pour out his soul's sorrow to the Fountain -of Inspiration! Long, yes very long, was the death of this righteous man lamented in the pleasant village. Very little time was spent in settling the Pyrone estate. The old servants, retained their places. Lady Pyrone's temper had become greatly subdued since her recent affliction. The deacon had be- queathed handsome legacies to many of his friends; the servants and Hiram Banks were not forgotten by him. Lawrence Hovert had left for his place of business, not intending to return until he came to claim his affianced bride; the good and lovely Kitty Lenson. As Mr. and Mrs. Sherford were obliged to leave yery soon, Byron proposed to the family that he should accompany Mrs. Pyrone to the home of her sister, Mrs. Hovert; as this was soon agreed upon, they started'upon their journey. Kitty was to stay with Elisiner in her aunt's absence. Reader, we will follow our travelers. The good rector (whom we have already introduced) was about thirty years of age; his wife had long been an inva- lid, and on the morning previous to the arrival of our travelers, had died. This lady had inherited, at her father's death, a very extensive library. Now Clarence had become a great favorite with both the rector and his wife; and before the latter died, she selected two large and rare volumes from said library, requesting that they should be given to the young gentleman student.        : Byron -remained at Mrs. Hovert's for nearly four weeks; and then proceeded further 'onward, to spend a few weeks with some of her cousins.   Meanwhile, Benson superintended the farm-work      : at Pyrone Mansion, with an occasional hint from      i their neighbor, Mr. Williams. Elisiner had received but one letter from Clarence, in which he stated that his health was not much improved. He had met       X with friends during his journey, who advised him to proceed still farther towards the south, as they     W thought that the climate would prove beneficial to     him. The lover added that his tour was a lonely one, without the company of one who was his earthly sunshine. Every word breathed forth hope, faith and love. We only give a short extract of this, the first and last missive which Ellsiner received from him, until after his return. "Dear one! may the Star of Faith bear thy sinking spirit upwards, as a dark cloud resteth over thee. " A budget of news awaited Elly, on her aunt's return; news from hovre. Byron, who had been bid- den to deliver the two volumes into Elly's keeping, until Clarence's return, failed to do so for many days. Then Ritty, learning the dying lady's wish, repri- manded her brother, and gave the volumes to Elisiner herself, apologizing for her brother, that maybe he did not wish to make her unhappy at the sight of anything belonging to her lover, whilst he was so far away. Ah, good-hearted Kitty! little did you dream that your brother was playing a deceiver's part in thus witholding these books from   your friend!  Elisiner's mother had written for her to hasten home as soon as she could be spared. Nearly a week elapsed ere Byron delivered the many presents sent by him to Elisiner. There was a beautiful scarf, wrought in colored silk, a gift from her sister Almi- na; a reticule from Lunette, and a fine bunch of paper flowers from Annette; a handsome bird-cage,  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7571-00000130"/> 260 containing two young canaries, alsoa bag of bird's seed, and a book of instructions by an experienced bird's man, from her uncle Orvian. But last and best of all, a largeBible, with silver clasps, accom- panied with a long letter from her dearest and best of mothers, and a box of frosted cake from the entire family. Doubtless the reader would like to know why the last tempting present was sent, as we all know that there is a peculiar interest attached to such cake. Well, it was manufactured in New York, and was one day passed about when the bachelor uncle was drop- ped out of our'list, and as a substitute he now occupies husband's and father's place. Yes, Elriner has now a good friend to fill her noble father's place, a par. ent who considers himself under sacred obligations to his beloved child. After Elisiner had made a i short visi home, her sister Annette returned to the mansion with her. No letters from Clarence yet. How mysterious! What could it mean?     Elisiner sometimes fancied that he might be ill, or even dead. How! sad it must be for him to be away among stran- gers!      ! Autumn had commenced, and the leaves -were changing their hue; summer had passed away very quickly. Annette was attending school in town, so lisiner had many lonely hours.  Mr. Sherford often visited  the family at the  mansion. A  marked change had taken place in Mrs. Pyrone. It was lw   n  ncommnon aocurrenc to find her in the kit chen pleasantly conversing with Aunt Nell, and the rest of the faithful servants.  Aside from the recent death of her husband, there, seemed to be some mighty trouble weighing upon her mind.   Byron E lw -divided his time between  his mother's cot- tage and, the mansion; doing   a thousand little   things to assist Mrs. Pyrone. He still manifested the greatest respect and tenderness for Elly. One afternoon when Elisiner had been trying to school her heart to bear with patience any blow which her Heavenly Father should see fit to send to her, when a letter was handed her by the post-boy, The death of her lover was announced within hy a stranger, who was present when he died. He also stated that Clarence was wasted to a mere skeleton, and a short time previous to his death had requested him (the stranger) to inform herself and his friends of the true state of affairs. The letter fell from her hands; an hour after she was found lying senseless in her own room. Mrs, Pyrone, seeing the open letter on the floor, turned deathly pale. And well she might! A few weeks passed away. The poor stricken lamb was a mere wreck of her former self. Annette left her school, and tried by every endearing art to change her sister's stony sorrow, but in vain. Poor Elly's grief was deep and silent. Heer parents wished her to return home to them, for their hearts were deeply pained for her. Ere long it was decided that Mr. Sherford should remove to the mansion, and recommence the improve- ments on his future home, the old garrison. A few days prior to Elisiner's departure for home, she was slowly walking up and down the banks of the lovely lake, (where, it has been mentioned, the mother of Clarence and Amelia Pyrone once encoun- tered a snake,) when, becoming weary, she seated herself to rest. Her soul was previously seated upon the bank of despair. The woodlands appeared to participate in her gloom. Her young Star of Hope had dropped far back into a dim, misty atmosphere, and the vacuum was occupied by clouds of darkpesa. &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7571-00000131"/> 262 Every tiny warbler in the adjacent vale, and even the clearer, stronger strains of the forest birds, seemed pouring forth their evening lays ill woe. But now a gentle whisper, as of some white-winged Angel of Peace, aroused her, and there was a soft rustling as of wings. Tears gathered and trembled upon the dark fringes of the lovely maiden's eyes. "Ah, sweet one! peace lies hidden beneath the dark depths of the black, stormy waves of thy young life! Thinkest thou that thine heart will ever have a grief? that thou must always listen to the dark, angry waves beating around and within thy poor, crushed soul?  Thine Heavenly Father has not utterly for- saken thee!  Drop all thy woes. at the footstool of Christ, and cheer thy soul i" The  maiden obeyed the heavenly visitant.  She bowed her young head to God's footstool, and'was comforted. In a  few days Elisiner was in the midst of loved ones at home. Now her tired head could rest on her mother's loving  breast, where, fron her earliest infancy, she had ever found refuge from outward and inward griefs. Gentle tones breathed words of sym- pathy in her ear, and she was content. Annette had remained behind with Mrs. Pyrone. Often, with her friend Hattie- Williams, did she steal up into the little east garret, where her sister had spent so many hours. It may appear singular that one so young and delicate as our heroine should pre- fer to remain so much alone. Bat people are differ- ently constituted. A meditative individual possess- ing an investigating mind, does not, when alone,- dwell upon the vain, airy nothings that fill the thoughts of narrow-minded persons. Mrs. Sherford, with her husband, now resided at the mansion. She was now walking the same paths ^tentSj^^^^ ^ -.U0^ t^     0^ Z^   263   as in former years, when she lived in the smiles of her good father. Willie and -Elbur Lenson often accompanied the girls in their rambles. These boys were fast becomning young men. Lawrence Hovert returned home much sooner than had been anticipated. Two notes which he had long held against certain creditors of his deceased fathers, were now paid over to himself. Aside from these notes, he had settled numerous other affairs which his father had left in a state of disorder. He had also put forth his energies in investigating the deep intricacies of law, in behalf of the redemption of his mother's lost property. Mrs. Hovert was thankful for even a portion of her rightful property. As for Dr. Hovert, he was fast becoming a prodigy among the people of A---- for his unsurpassing medical skill. Cases of long standing were brought before his notice, and his prescriptions were usually success- ful; whilst many another physician had declared himself baffled, and had given up said patients to die. Oft-times simple means prove more efficient than powerful ones. Lawrence and Kitty tried every inducement that love could suggest to persuade Elisiner to accompany them to New York on their bridal tour; but she only, thanked them, though she deeply appreciated their kind solicitude, and observed that if the coming season were summer instead of winter, she might comply with their wishes,. as a change might prove beneficial to her health and spirits; and besides, she always wished to gratify the desires of her dear friends. "Should I live until another year," she said, " and if you still desire my company, I will go with you to New York. You say that no views equal those of the Highlands and the Hudson, for grandeur; and &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7571-00000132"/> that the Falls of Niagara are sublime. I admire- such scenes, as you know; but such resorts are not for me now, my brother, so I must wait." o *         o   -    O  Now reader, we will pass over seven months, if you please, and we may again find Lawyer Hyovert and his young wife in our midst. Smiling June is here in all her lovliness; and what is more bewitching in nature than a plentiful diffusion of purity and lovliness! Byron Elwell had travelled much, until now he had secured a situation in a distant town as railroahi contractor; having transferred the entire care of his farm  to Major Elwell, who now resided at the brown cottage with his sister. Elbur was growing up as fair a specimen of nobleness, both outwardly and inwardly, as generally greets one's eye. Wilhe was studying at a celebrated seminary, preparatory to entering college. Annette still continued to reside with   her' Aunt pyrone, at the mansion.  Major Elwell, his sister, lIrs. Lenson, and Mrs. Pyrone, had added their entreaties to those of Dr. Hovert and lady, for their pet Elisiner to accede to the wishes of Byron Elwell, to become his bride. Could they have peeped into the interior of her aching heart, they would have ceased their entreaties. But  they conquered! Byron Elwell and Elisiner Hovert were married.  They journeyed to New York with Lawrence and Kitty, who now made a second tour on account of the second bridal. They soon returned, however, and settled down in a beautiful, romantic spot. Byron was never weary of adoring his beautiful wife. His love for her knew no bounds. Elly- often sighed that she could not return such devotoedness.  She often  wondered  at her Aunt   265 Pyrone's singular appearance. She had never imag- ined that such a depth of love existed in her he  as she now lavished upon herself. Elly's mot er had often told her that her aunt possessed kindly feelings, though she thought that she had tried as faithfully as anybody to discover them, though with- out apparent success until now. Well reader, here we are in the same old house where We first met Mrs. Elisiner Elwell and her friend Foresetta. Here, also, we find Elly's darling little boy Herbert, and the husband whom we have already portrayed as sitting asleep in his easy-chair, his newspaper falling from his hand; then as being awakened by the high wind, and the scratching which pussy makes outside the window. The little rosy- cheeked lad reclines upon the rounded arm of his young mother, and our old friend and heroine, Elisiner. Here on a pleasant afternoon we find the two friends alone in. the same old chamber, chatting of by-gone days. Foresetta had come to spend several weeks with -Mrs. Elwell. Both avoided going into the old attic, as Foresetta noticed that whenever her friend went thither her countenance wore a sad- der expression than usual. Doubtless it reminded her of the old east garret at the dear old Pyrone Mansion, and of flitting visions of other days when she frequented its hallowed precincts. Many tears fell at the memory of departed days. But has she not stood beside those cherished ones even until they had passed the boundaries of death? There was her father, little Dora, her uncle; and last of all, she had, about one year ago clasped the cold hand, and caressed the brow--which was moist with the dews of death-of her best of mothers! Ah, .how her young soul had been brought to drink of the bitter waters of life! Bat. these dear friends had 23  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7571-00000133"/> 266' left frail mortality, for immortality in a land where no parting is known. Then there was Clarence Ner- vourn; the noble, and generopu Clarence! excellent disciple of his Redeemer, who died among strangers. How the very thought pierced the heart of the bride Elisiner. But he had died in the happy trust of Christ's love; the kind stranger whom he had com- missioned to communicate these sad tidings to his Friends had said so; and although their acquaintance ras short, he remarked upon his amiability and ?ureness of heart. These were consoling thoughts ;o poor Elly. She had married, and intended to perform her luty in every respect, as a wife and mother should; hough,   ofttimes, her husband's fits of gloomy abstractedness pained her. uir. Elwell's influence was sought by the rich and he  poor; his path seemed decked with budding tonors.  Ere long a dark shadow from the tomb fell pon- the pet of the household; the pet of all who Lad listened to his sweet, lisping accents. His dark urls were pushed back from  his fevered brow, and rith sad hearts the parents watched over their stricken ower. .But soon   the stream of re-animating life ommenced its slow course, through the little svstem, nd the  bright, beautiful  Herbert, lived. Mr. Ilwell's feelings had been recently enlisted in solic- iude  for the recovery of his little son. Now the )rmer. current of gloom returned, again a restless- ess seemed   to pervade his heart. One evening hen Elisiner was watching   little Herbert's agile lovements, Byron  started from  his chair with a roan, saying:-  - "Elly, my poor, patient, injured lamb!"Then anding aloof, added-"Elly, you must hate me!" "Hate you, my  husband ' you, who never gave e aught save ki;ndness!T   267  "Elly, it is your duty to despise me!"       ; "My poor husband, you are not well. Your late, constant watching has impaired your nerves!"      i ' No, it is not that, my kind angel; though you  may love me a little while longer.'" "Yes, dear husband, I will. But you had best have tea early to-night, so you may retire, and sleep off your recent fatigue." In another week Mr. Elwell left home to attend to business, and not expected until late, the family retired, with the exception of his wife, who whiled  t away the leisure hours with the work of an interest- .i ing author. At length she heard hurried steps, and  M her husband rushed by to his chamber. She followed, , and winding her arms about his neck, entreated him t , to explain to her the cause of his disquietude.    r "Oh Elly, I'm so sick!" The hired  man  was instantly aroused, and despatched for the doctor. There were symptoms of  brain fever, but by skillful treatment and good nurs-  ing, this was evaded, and he was partially restored  to his usual health. The mother and uncle of Byron    watched by his bedside; but in a week they returned   to the cottage. About this time a letter was received, wherein Mr. Elwell was bidden to attend to a certain part of his business if his health would permit, as a  meeting of the railroad contractors would be heldi- at-----in a few days. So the gentleman left home,1  not expecting to return until the expiration of a    week. Mrs. Elwell remonstrated with her husband     against leaving home whilst in ill health, but he felt  obliged to go.         Ai On the second day of his absence, dark portentous :a clouds arose, and the wind howled in the forest. The muffled voice of distant thunder was heard away in the darkened skies, and the sun had hidden his *            -        X1l  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7571-00000134"/> 268 face in dismay. The wind,    llting hail-stones, nd forked lightning struck terror to many hearts. Lit- tle Herbert clung close to his mother. Foresetta closed the window-shutters, and  extinguished the fire. But now another trouble arose; the barn door had been left unshlut. What was to be dlone in this dilemma?   Foresetta offered to go and close it; but  even after this was accomplished, tle barn stood in jeopardy of being blown over. Elly would not con- sent to let her fi'iend go alone. As they were returning to the hlouse, tile horse of a trcaveller in the road be3came firiglhtcned; but for- tunately there was but one person in the vehicle, and that person a gentleman ; so, with surprising intre- pidity he leaped from the carriage, and in a measure restrained the frantic animal. "nomne in.! come in, sir!" in a woman's voice- pierced through the stormi to the ear of the traveller. Foresetta caught up the frightened  Herbert, whose fingers had    come  in contact with a  swinging door, receiving    rather an uncomfortable squeeze, and car- ried him to the kitchen.     Mleantime  the traveller's horse broke loose, and escaped through  an open gate which led directly to the barn.  IHeree he ound shel- ter beneath a    shed, and stood neighing and  winking  sullenly at the unceremnonious sto/m. -Tilhe strng er wished to know if he could be of ally assistance to the ladies, and Elly, hearing the cries, answered that she would run and see to her       child and send her friend to attend to him.  Foresetta was applying lin- imenfL to the poor little bruised fingers when Elisiner found her.  She said:-- "I- will attend to little Herberr, Elly, if-you will go and see if the stranger needs anything. He is doingquite well now, I     believe, and does not need you.,   269 Elly returned, and found the stranger standing with his back to the door, intently watching the progress of the storm. He turned hastily, as she entered, and his face grew deadly pale as he watched her; his large, dark eye dilated, he convulsively grasped the chair by which he stood, and in a husky voice said:- " Who are you ?" There was no response, but a steady gaze, and a few murmured words. 'The stranger's face became more and more livid. Then a gush of reason which, for a moment, had seemed to desert its throne, shone through the dimmed vision of the lady. " What! is this a vision ? has the mighty thunder' startled my lover from his slumbers?  Who--who is this ?  My God ! is it-it can't be Clarence Ner- rourn! No, no, he died and was buried beneath southern skies.' It can't be Clarence !" Calmness dawned at length upon the bewildered brain of Elisiner, and sinking upon a sofa, she strug- gled with the various emotions that possessed her. Could it be true that Clarence, the supposed dead, was again brought in contact with the loved being of his early days ? Indeed, here was real flesh and blood, and no mistake: for the ebbing tide would alternate, making his face crimson at one moment, and then leaving it as white as that of a ghost. It was no dream, bhut reality. The gentleman broke the painful silence :-- " Elisiner do I find you the same happy, trusting friend, and the-the--" his voice faltered; as he continued passionately:-4- Oh Elly ! my heart tells me that there is some mistake; that you are not the heartless one ! Elly, you couldn't break a devoted heart like mine !" "Clarence ! Clarence ! Oh, my poor brain whirls! What do you mean ?'T &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7571-00000135"/> 270          '   1 "Poor, dear Elly, did you think that I had proved false?' "' o, no; they told me that you were dead!"  '"Dead "                      "Yes, Clarence, and I have the letter now wherein your death was announced."             j "Treason! Where did such a foul report origi- nate?" "Oh Clarence, long did my heavy crape bear tes- timony to the sad heart beneath it. The wound grew deeper and deeper, and long did I labour to bow to' my Father's will, hoping ere long that when my life's journey was completed, to meet you, my Clarence, in the bright land where there are no tears, and no partings. I knew that your bright spirit would be the first to welcome mine to those upper courts!" "Oh, my Elisiner, my own deceived one!" Who could thus torture a heart like thine!" He paused abruptly, and asked:-- "( Is Byron Lenson living?" A sudden thought burst upon Elisiner's brain, as she convulsively started, and exclaimed:- "Oh, can it be so! Oh, Father in Heaven!" "What is it, my own angel?" "Just now little Herbert came running into the room, in all his childlike innocence, not even per- ceiving the stranger. Mamma, mamma, the naughty thunder is gone way off!" And he nestled his little head in his mother's bosom, patting her cheek with his rosy, dimpled hand. Then espying the stranger, he cast a look of fear towards him, as though he comprehended that he was, in some way, the cause of his mamma's sad countenance. s          271 ," What child is this?" "Mine!" replied Elisiner, convulsively. "t Elly, explain!" exclaimed Clarence, with a half- sorrowful, half-reproachful look. Foresetta now came to the door, and after a few words with Mrs. Elwell, left the apartment, taking little Herbert with her. The meeting between the lovers was a sad one, doubtless; as the haggard countenances of both bore testimony to the truth. In about two hours the gen- tleman left the house, and, as the storm had abated, he was enabled to pursue his journey. Long, very long, did the poor heart-stricken Elly sit alone, sobb- ing to herself,- until Foresetta went to her, and with gentle force, recalled her to life once more, as it were. They conversed together for a half hour, and tears of sympathy were mingled with Elisiner's. On the next day Mr. Elwell returned, in a state of mind bordering upon derangement. The unhappy man constantly cried out:- ' Oh, I've seen him! I've seen him!" In vain did his gentle wife try to mitigate his sufferings by soothing language; it was not until the ensuing daythat he became calmer. Some dark veil seemed partially uplifted from his mental woes. Only Elisiner's kind words, and above all her calm, quiet demeanor, and gentle sweetness, appeased his worried soul. "Elisiner," he said " my own dear wife, come here to my side." After some low words on both sides, he contin- ued :- Your forgiveness, my own Elly, has proved an unexpected, and soothing cordial to a heart that is nearly broken. I have longed, though never dared, to ask it before. My love for you plunged my soul  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7571-00000136"/> 2" into the deep gulf of sinful deceit. You are par-- tially acquainted with my past wickedness, but much remaineth to be told. I must send for one who has been wickedly deceived; one who has been sinfully duped. Elisiner, " continued the wretched man, fix- ing his -dark eye steadfastly upon her, can you raise sufficient courage to meet one whom you have so long considered as dead?" The sick man expected to witness a sad scene, the anticipation of which had long tortured his peace of mind. But he was spared this. Thinking that his wife had not fully comprehended his meaning, he concluded to repeat his question. "My husband, I am willing to bear anything, if it will confer any peace to your mind." "And yet my kind Elly, it is but acting up to the dictates of your own noble nature." Mrs. Elwell did not consider that much good, though much ill could accrue from informing her husband of her recent interview with Clarence; therefore wisely concluded to allow her husband to remain in ignorance of the truth on that point. She was resolved to avoid meeting Mr. Nervourn again; but if it was necessary, she would nerve her heart to bear the meeting with becoming fortitude. Mr. Elwell could not bear the thoughts of ushering the duped lover into the presence of his injured wife without their knowledge of the facts beforehand. He was about to speak more explicitly, when his wife was summoned from the room, and just then the ser- vant appeared who was to receive orders from the sick man in regard to setting out for the person in question. A short time elapsed ere Mrs. Elwell returned to her husband's room. The weary man stretched forth his hand, and clasped that of his wife; then feebly whispered ;-   273 "My noble wife, 1 have a presentiment that ere many suns have risen and set, I shall cease to exist on this earth." Bowing his head upon the arm of his gentle sup- porter, he continued:- 4 Elly, I have a burden upon my heart Oh! how can I commence a tale which Aill cause every fibre of your heart to vibrate with unparalleled grief! every sentence condemning myself." "Dear husband, do not distress yourself with such an unpleasant effort; you are much too weak to bear anything of the kind." The fearful results, both to her husband and self, sent heart-sickening flashes through her brain. Like the muttering of some distant cataract, or the break- ing up of some mighty embankment, with its waters dashing furiously, sounding nearer and nearer each moment, engulfing all before it, and you fully aware of its unrestrained fury, making one last, quivering effort to escape from the calamity-like this did the young, wretched wife attempt to evade the impending blow, as she stood by the side of her dying husband. All the calmness which s,.possessed was now called into requisition, lest a betrayal of the woeful sorrows that were bearing down her soul, might put to flight the last spark of her husband's composure and reason. She gently whispered:- "My poor husband, no sin of such vast magnitude but that a sincere repentance and firm reliance upon a Saviour's love will ensure, our forgiveness when we go to Him in childlike faith and humility. Our Heavenly Father has a pitying eye, and deals gently with His erring children. He has compassion upon those who cry unto Him in deep and sincere contri- tion.1 The dying man looked up and smiled upon his sweet comforter.  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7571-00000137"/> 274 "Elly, my love for you was unbounded; I tried hard to forget you, and you will remember that I frequently absented myself from my mother's cot- tage. I engaged in pursuits such as I felt assured would engross my mind; yet nothing dispelled the gloom, and I may say madness, which was racking my very soul. TheniI wickedly resolved to wreck the future happiness, and thwart the movements and plans of your lover, and my rival, Clarence Nervourn. I had known him in past years, whilst at---- Sem- inary. No wonder that you tremble and grow pale. I knew and understood his noble, nature well. A cruel friend assisted me in my plans, and hurried me headlong into the acts of wickedness. As soon as I became aware of Clarence's intention to sail for his native land, I followed him." Elisiner now remembered that Byron left his home at this time. We will here state that a few days prior to Clarence's departure, Byron hastened to D------, and there ingratiated himself into the good graces of a man who would assume any charac- ter, however atrocious, provided he was to receive ample remuneration. Taiindividual was to keep a sharp lookout on the movements of our hero, and as soon as he reached his destination, was to feign friendship, and take the livliest interest in all concer- ing him. ;:Hurone's disposition was naturally acri- monious to a high degree; 'though some sweet drops still lingered in his composition to mingle with the acid. The man become prepossessed in the young student's favor almost as soon as he saw him. Indeed, this was the case with all who knew him; even Byron Elwell respected his goodness and uprightness of character. But love, like other passions, perverts 9 We call him by a name which he assumed at this time.   275 one's better judgment. Only one letter reached Elisiner, written by her lover. Clareince was introduced into various circles of society, wherin he chose companions congenial to himself. Ere long his confiding heart was draped in consternation and deep grief at the reception of a letter, penned as he supposed by his betrothed Elis- ner, purporting that her heart, since his departure, was wholly changed towards him; that she could never be his companion for life, Mr. Nervourn replied to this letter immediatly; then came another missive from Elisiner, as he supposed, informing him that she was on the eve of marrying a gentleman whom he (Clarence) had never seen. Reader, doubtless you have some idea of the emotions of this gentle- man at this painful intelligence. A fever was the result. Long did poor Clarence hover between life and death. During his convalescence, he searched the inner temple of his heart, and there found that he had established an idol on its alter, and now it had fallen. Perhaps it was but just and proper after all. Hurone felt some con   tion at first, but his employer was wealthy, ai  ad offered him enor- mous sums of money, if he would not retract. He was very kind to his victim, however, and as soon as he was able advised him-to travel farther south for the purpose of regaining has accustomed strength. Thither they journeyed in company, remaining there three years. Meantime Clarence pursued his studies with a learned divine. In due .time he was made the pastor of a small church, where he officiated for quite a length of time, deeply adored by his parish- ioners. A sadness frequently came over him, when memory reverted to other days, and at' length his physical strength gave way, and he was obliged  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7571-00000138"/> 276 to announce to his people his intention Of leaving them. Their hearts were sad on receiving this intel- ligence, but they readily assented to his views, and were willing to part with their highly-prized pastor, if by so doing, he might be benefited. It proved sweet solace to poor Clarence when he witnessed the sincere love which his people manifested towlrds him.7 Mementoes of love and respect were presented to him previous to his departure, though they hoped that his absence would prove short. One evening, whilst Clarence was busying himself with preparations for the journey, word was brought him that in the raising of the new hall, some heavy timbers had fallen, and had injured some of the workmen. Among the wounded, was   -lurone. The young clergyman was soon bending over the sufferer; and for two long weeks he scarcely left his side. It is quite true that oft-times our own - ( .1 sol'- rows are greatly mitigated, when sonime up' .;se ei .! amity occurs to our friends, and our i bilities an' sympathies are enlisted in their behalf. This :,as the case with our friend Clarence. The ravings of the il'  often thrilled the soul of his faithful attendantBs t at last he became morer comfortable. One evening he informed his friend that he had been shamefully sinned against, and that he was duped into a cruel belief concerning the marriage of his early love. ( I cannot live much longer," he said. after a brief pause. "No, I cannot live, and your pure exemplary life, dear Clarence, has fully convinced me of my past errors, and of my duty towards my fellow- beings. Thank God, it is through your efforts and Christianity that I have come to believe as I do. I regard my recent accident as a necessary evil to give me time for reflection and an opportunity to search into the interior of my heart."   2" The young clergyman was entranced with this confession from the lips of one who had, hitherto appeared so unpromising. Joy and love were blended, as with moistened eye, he asked himself:- "And have I been instrumental in leading this soul to the feet of Christ? 9 The thought was a happy one. Then deep grief and joy of another nature seemed racking his poor heart. Could it be that Elisiner was, and had been true to her first love all these years? How could he have doubted her pure nature? whispered the angel of self-accusation. Then a vague apprehension siezed him that she might be dead; but the theme was too sad a one to dwell upon, therefore he dismissed it instantly. Meantime, many questions were put to the sick man. "Sir, by whom were you induced to act so deceit- ful a part?" "At present I must not mention his name." "A So it is all a forgery, then; Elly did not prove false to me?" The man did noireply. Mr. Nervourn grew impatient at his delawy "You must infor  me this, then. Is she mar- ried?"  "She has ever remained faithful to you in heart, sir, whatever her circumstances may be now: My poor injured friend, I pity you, when I say I believe that ehe is marriedt " Clarence groaned audibly. "How can she be true to me then? Pray speak, man, and inform me if my Elisiner still lives! Can it be that the riches of this world have gained the ascendency over her pure, unspotted nature, to lead her womanly heart so far from its original location!" 24  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7571-00000139"/> 278 The sick man had fallen into a stupor, occasioned by pain and weariness. "Sleep on, poor man!" murmured Clarence, " you have been but a tool in the hands of some subtle villian." And as he gazed upon the pale features, he felt pity for the man, and a sincere prayer went up from his heart, to the foot stool of our Saviour, in the dying man's behalf. Towards dawn the-invalid awoke and motioned his attendant to his side. He learned thatea forged let- ter -had been forwarded to his father, informing that gentleman that his son never intended to return to his native land; and moreover, that it would be use- less for him to write to make any inquiries concern- ing him, as he was intending to travel again very soon. The heart of the pastor became very sad on learning this. In a few days mortification took place in the man's bruised limb, and Clarence never quitted his post ,save when nature asserted her claims too loudly to be withstood. All that he cou   distinguish from Hurone's incoherent mutteri ], was that Elisiner had married a very rich gentleman, because her par- ents were desirous that she should settle down in a home of her own. The failing man seemed strangely re-animated whilst faltering out these disconnected sentences. He lingered much longer than'the physi- cian had hoped that he could. At length there came. the peaceful calm which precedes death. He revived sufficiently to press the hand of his faithful atten- dant, and to thank him for his kindness,- as he whis- pered a faint but tender farewell. His last words were:- "You will be happy yet, my dear friend!" After his remains were attended to,' Clarence set   279 out for his native land. He lingered but a short time at his own home, but'traveled to New York. Now reader, you may remember the instance recorded in the forgoing pages, when Mr. Elwell returned to his home in an unhappy frame of mind, when the sudden illness of his child seemed to throw his recent gloom into the background. And here we again find him, but this time he is lying upon his deathbed. He has sent for a stranger, and we know who .that stranger is. At both of the times that Mr. Elwell was absent from  home, he encoun- tered Clarence Nervourn. He met him at first in the cars; the second time was during a collision between the up and down train. Sad, unexpected meeting were these, though neither gentleman had sustained any injury, except that of being thrown into one another's society so unceremoniously. Byron Elwell affected the greatest pleasure at meeting with an old friend. Meanwhile Clarence imparted to this gentleman all the knowledge which Hurone had imparted to him on his dying bed. iMr. Elwell had not the moral courage-to come out manfully andcon- fess that he was the wretch who had basely fabricated such falsehoods. Instead of owning his wrong acts, he loudly and boldly demonstrated against the pro- ceedings of Mr. Nervourn's supposed enemy, whoever he might be. A fever followed this meeting, when Byron learns that he must die. But he could not lie down in peace until he had confessed his sins, black as they were. He had 'received into his hard- ened heart the balmy drops of forgiveness, on the part of his young and injured Wife; and a sweet voice whispered that he was forgiven by God. Sweet assurances! But there was still another, whose for- giveness he sought; and one, too, who had never  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7571-00000140"/> 280 willingly cost his heart one pang. That person was Clarence Nervourn. There were footsteps upon the stairs. "You may retire, my poor wife, if you wish it, your heart shall be spared this sad interview. I know that your soul must be tried beyond endurance." Misiner descended to the kitchen, where she unex- pectedly encountered Captain Dunbar, the husband of her dear friend Foresetta. The interview between Mr. Elwell and Clarence Nervourn was necessarily long and painful. The latter learned for the first time how cruelly he had been betrayed by one whom he had never injured. Elisiner was exonerated from all blame. After the interview, Clarence descended to the sitting-room, where he called for writing utensils, and writing a 'letter, he sealed it, then left it in charge of Captain Dnnbar, who was to give it to Mrs. Elwell. We will give the reader a brief extract of this letter. "MY HIGHLY-PRIZED FRIEND ELISINER:--I have just returned from a trying, and" painful scene. The position in which we have been placed is a peculiar one.  You are exonerated from  every shadow of blame.  Your past sorrows -have called forth deep streams of pity and sympathy from the fountain of my   heart,. I have learned  all. It is a history fraught with painful events, the knowledge of which must have called forth all the heroism and fortitude which you possess, my idolized friend." Then in a retired manner peculiar to himself, he solicited the forgiveness and forgetfulness of certain remarks which were wrung from him on a previous visit to the house, when little Herbert bounded into the apartment where they were setting.   281 C"Your husband requested me to come to him whilst he yet survived," he continued, " and I came, although my heart yearned to behold my only remaining parent, to correct the unnatural charge made against me." The dark pall of Death was unfurled over the household. Gently did its last shadow fall, and Byron Elwell was at peace. The lately- returned clergyman, Mr. Nervourn, preached the funeral ser- mon. As soon as all affairs were properly adjusted, Mrs. Elwell and her little boy Herbert accompanied Mrs. Lenson and Major Elwell to New Hampshire, where they remained a few weeks, then visited Grafton, where her dear mother had died. The Rev. Mr. Anson resided here, also, with his second lady, Elisiner's sister Almina. After remaining for a few. days with her father, Dr. Hovert, they proposed visit- ing the tomb wherein- her dear mother's remains rested. -As the mourning group passed through the  gate, they gave one lingering look back towards the charnel-house; the sable door of which contrasted mournfully with the waving branches of the wil- low which shaded the front entrance. This place of the dead was altogether a lovely place; yes, sweet in its very peace and lonliness! Mr. Anson and his wife, and 'Dr. Hovert resided., in the same place where, for many years, her parents: and sisters had dwelt. Annette boarded at the par-- sonage. She was engaged to the assistant teacher, in an academy near by;- Professor Eldredge by name. Little Herbert wasa general favorite wher- ever he went. - He thought himself quite a man upon the strength of having reached his fourth birth- day, and sporting a handsome plumed beaver upon his dark, curly head. Many a silent tear dropped,  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7571-00000141"/> ftom the young widow's eyes; for she had lifed long enough to knw and feel the instability of allearthly things; Oft-times would she sigh as she looked upwards, and her-soul's eye penetrated far beyond the azure star-bespaagled sky, and thought of that home" not made by ,hands, but Eternal in the hea- A few weeks later, arid Elisiner found herself treading upon familiar ground. How sad, yet how pleasing! Numerous alterations had taken place during the six. years of her absence. Our herine is :now nearly twenty-five. TwiCe had she visited this state:with her husbanqd, besides hearing constantly of all changes by the meansof correspondence with her fiends. Still the scenes had changed: Here she wasa widow, with her blooming, prattling boy, all bright with life aid activity, returned to the scenes of her youth. Elisiner seemed even more beautiful than ever; so C(L^ O" pure! and an etherial lolk shone forth fromjher larger speaking, dreamy eyes. Her amiv M  was hailed with: interest. Even Tiger, the wateh-dog of " auld lane-g sne," who had gro r namerly blind, kept his faithful. old heart in as warm a case as in those days when he used to follow Elly about theold garret, or gambolled with her in thy orchard; in those idays when his young mistress would give hi. the slip, leaving him to sniff away until he C6OUld tIraekt her k bteet footsteps away thr'ough the house, up the witnding stairing to the foot of thj itairs leading to the little eas-ft garret. These were prbeseribed limit's where his dogAhip never attempted to go; so he 'Wouild drop his ears in that sorrowful 3iianhei, of'his, and Ellyj would pat his great neck, aid seat liherkelf upon the -Upper step, where she *ould 'hld his sh head! batween hef hands for a oizentj anid then -im hid, aa cheSery ,e r goodLbYe ir! ir   283  This faithful creature started up at the sound of her voice, and he really seemed to grow young again, as, he ran in front of Elly in her tour through the old fami-, liar. rooms. Amelia believed that his sight would be- come restored again, under Elly's cheering influence. Old Phil wept for very joy when he learned that M( "Dliss Elly " would remain at the mansion for a long ,time. He declared that he had ten times ten things to show to her. There was the new young-orchard ,down by the old lane beyond   the red gate, where Miss Elly (as he persisted in calling her,) (Clarence,) and the twin-sisters, Annette and Lunette used to roam in young Spring and sober Autumn; then there was the new cider-mill down by the big maple clump, close by the bars to the orchard and numer- ous other things of similar interest to himself. And little Sally--but stop! I guess that old Father Time has been giving her a lift in the world; for she is tall and healthy, and as pretty a lass of seventeen as one generally finds stowed away among the hills of New Hampshire. She always attended school in the Winter, and many summers, also. She had many curious things to show little Herbert. There were chickens, with some new-fangled name, and a two-year-old spotted heifer, all of which belonged to Sailly, exclusively. And now where is kind-hearted    Aunt Nell? Come this way; we will follow this narrow footpath, Which is Nelly's, made mostly by her feet, in wend- ing her way to and from the cottage of her married daughter and the Pyronie mansion. Between these fadmiles she divides her time; coming and going, when she pleases. -She bustles about in tle great' square kitchen just as she used to do in olden days assisting Sally about 'this, or that odd job, or at;r tending to many aa hliing which was needed, and&#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7571-00000142"/> 284 which could be performed only by this faithful crea- ture. But to describe the happiness of good Aunt Nell at meeting her old pet, would be uttely impos- sible. Elisiner walked over to the cottage of the daughter with Aunt Nell, where the two chubby lit- tle boys were soon having merry times with little Herbert.. The superintendence of the farm devolved upo6i Mr. Sherford, with the assistance of the faithfulai workmen,'Aunt Nell's son-in-law, and Old Phil, and an occasional days work from Hiram Banks, the pro- tegeof Amelia. He was grown to a fine youth; at least Sally seems to think so, and the lad entertained' similar sentiments towards his fair friend. But the greatest change of all seems to have been wrought in Lady Pyrone. The lofty headdress of other days has given place to a neat white cap, and instead of her old haughty demeanor, she exerciess quiet gentleness in all that she does and says. She sits down with Aunt Nell in the chimney-corner, and converses with her on various subjects, not unfre- quently mentioning the dear departed ones. There is no more trembling on the part of Sally, and Old Phil carries his earliest and nicest fruits to his kind mistress.  What could have produced so great a change?   We think that it must have been the chastening rod of the Father of all mercies. But' reader, we think that we must attribute her quiet melancholy to contrition for the wicked fpart which she acted in bringing about the. marriage between- Byron Elwell and her niece, Elisiner Hovert, and in circulating .the evil report of Clarence Nervourn s. death. But we must not anticipate! In his con- fession, Mr. Elwell did not implicate his accom- plice, nor even mention her name. Mrs. Amelia Sherford and Elisiner often visited   285 thie little brown cottage, where Mrs. Lenson still resided. She was the same well-tried friend and parent to Elisiner as in days of yore, and a doting ,' grandma" to little Herbert. Here were the small saplings that had once been set out by Byron Lenson; now standing out in stately splendor. Here was the same rose- bank, and Elly turned away to conceal her tears, as liltle Herbert questioned his grandmamma about his father, and both ladies turned the tide of conversation. Not unfrequently is it necessary to turn a new leaf of conversation, to seek a snug spot to rest one's thoughts upon. A trip to the place where the old garrison once stood; but not a trace of it is visible now. A large, neat house was long since erected on the site where it once stood, and it is now the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Sherford. A new orchard was springing up quite rapidly in the rear. Elbur Lenson has now returned home from college; and ere the hills are again draped in their wintry robes, he will lead to the alter his long-affianced bride, Lunette Hovert. Fears are entertained that thelvenerable minister will be summoned to his heavenly home ere another winter dawns. Long had this hoary pilgrim awaited "the coming of the Lord." Hattie Williams is a frequent visitor at the man- sion, she is probably on the lookout for Willie's return. Indeed, all of the friends were looking for- ward and anticipating the time when this truely esti- mable young man would again be with them. The reader will remember Willie's departure for college, only a few months previous to Elisiner's marriage; he has now finished a course of study, with due honors, and it was now his intention to set out on his  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7571-00000143"/> 286 first tour as a physician in one of thIe adjoining towns where an opening was offered him. Elisiner -had much leisure time on her hands, which she wished to turn to some  ood account. Her aunt proposed that she should open a select l school for the remainder of the, season.  "You were iaying the other day," remarked the *Pplntenfo uiin ro    heto, rmark  e d the aunt, smili ng, 'that vour mind required continual food; and I think that a room full of half-grown  children will be sufficient food to satisfy even the luostcraving intellect " The people in this vicinity were in fine spirits when it was announced that their favorite, rs. Elisi-  ner Elwell, intended to open school. Thee tere ] applications for tuition from the two Misses Williams, old Mr. TWilliam's grandchildren, lre. Mall and h SLquire Alfborough (old friends of Deacon, Pyrone,) and these taken with Aunt Nell's hoydenish grand- children, and Mrs. Sherford's sweet blue-eyed Gracie, and Elisiner's merry little Herbert, made up as inter- esting a class as she could have wished. Painting and embroidery was hailed by the misses as a pleasing and useful feature in the school. Great proficiency was manifested by the pupils, and satisfactory smiles rested upon the faces of parents and friends when- ever they visited the school. "But the heart, that restless  thing," throbbed wildly in the young : teacher's bosom, as she led her beautiful bov along the old familiar footpath, which led directly past the west side of Mrs. Lenson's brown cottage. The lingering wild rose-vines reminded her of days past and gone, and naught save their mem- ories remained to her. Byron was dead and gone! Though he was not her heart's choice, yet he never caused her sensitive heart one pang from-the time that: she became his wedded wife, until:he disclosed   287 '                  1 7  j lis. sad story of wrong-doing  subsequent to hig , death. His love for herself had blinded his judg-e ment, and she had every reason to believe that he had sought and found forgiveness with God. P'eace be with thee, departed friend  Sweetly mayst thou sleep in thy narrow bed. The perfume of thy death- less love still remains upon the heart's alter of the one whom thou didst love and die for, and will remain there until the dews of remembrance are swept from her heart.  Ell returned from school one day, and was agree- ably surprised at finding her brother Lawrence and his amiable wife, Kate, the friend of her early youth# and the sharer of her joys and sorrows. The poet sings that " Friendship is but a name; but not in this case, gentle reader. A happy greeting between friends long parted is quite a pleasing scene to the eye of a silent, unob- trusive  witness. There was a suspension of the school for a short time. In a day or two the arrival of other friends added greatly to the happiness of this family. The reader has been made acquainted with the unerring, Christian character of Mrs. Lenson. Her's was a meritorious life. Doubtless the heart of 'the reader has sent forth a sigh of pity for this excellent lady. But we will quiet your solicitude on that point. It was never deemed necessary to acquaint the mother with Byron's guilt and sinfulness towards Clarence Nervourn, and her daughter, Kate Hovert, was equally ignorant in regard to her brothers delin- quencies; though it is quite trjue that this best of sisters had often felt certain ,misgivings relative to the impetuous Byron, but the thought had never entered her true, sisterly heart that his nature could so demean itself as to bow to anything base, or to &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7571-00000144"/> 288 resort to any artifice which irould give pain to another. But a gush of pain had swept through her soul when she thought that there might be some mystery con- cerning the sudden disappearance and death of Clar- ence Nervourn, which he might understand. The twh friends had mourned in concert over the supposed premature death of their noble and worthy friend Clarence. But now the veil had fallen! the wild rose scat- tered its leaves over Byron's lowly bed, and the sad- dened Elly moved in their midst once more. The purple and golden tinted clouds parted, showing the clear blue between, with the stars, like angels' eyes peeping out from its canopied screen, and Elisiner stood once more alone, reading a lesson from the grandeur and sublimity of the heavens. . .  \   CHAPTER -XVL "If to feel the deep devotion Of a pilgrim at a shrine, If to weep with fond devotion Be to love thee, I am thine. "If to treasure every token, Every look, and every sigh, Every deep word thou hast spoken, Be to love thee, I am thine. 4' , Once the future spread before me Many a mipgled hope and fear; Now but one e'en glances o'er ae! Wilt thou still hold me dear?" MEs. E. HOWARD. Late one afternoon E-lisiner sat alone in her pleas- ant east chamber; one hand veiling her eyes, the other resting upon a few dry, pressed flowers that were lying upon' the same table where her head had been bowedl in grief only a few years since.   Her  eyes filled with tears at the memory of her gentle cousin Dora Pyrone, whose death she had so sincerely mourned. Again and again did she glance over the panorama of her life, as she sat thus sadly musing, when Ame- lia opened the door of her apartment and interrupted her reverie. She raised her thoughtful, and teat- dimmed eyes to her cousin, who looked very anxious, *2s5                 a i  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7571-00000145"/> 290 having observed that Elisiner was growing more melancholy of late. "6 Elly," she said, cheeringly, "I bring you tidings that our company will arrive this evening. Philip has just brought news from town to that effect." Then with a gentle rebuke to the young widow, she left the apartment. Elisiner bowed her head once more, and sighed heavily. "Faithful unto death!"These words carried a depth of meaning to her soul which no other person could comprehend. Those words rang in her ears on this " still lone eve," whilst a sombre shade was fast settling o'er the land- scape. And where was the young minister meantime? Elly had received several letters from him whilst at the mansion. but oh Z how sad and lonely did everything appear. Her earthly sun had hidden his once happy face behind a tear-bathed cloud. And now, reader, we will look in upon our friend Clarence. Poor young man! Sorrow delighted inr claiming him for her offspring. Immediately after Byron Elwell's burial, he repaired to his father's home. That parent had long been stricken with a numbness in his side, and a short time prior to the son's arrival, his remains had been consigned to the house appointed for the dead. Deeply did the worthy son mourn his parent's death. But a balm awaited him in the form "of a letter rghich he found among his father's effects; a letter penned by a stranger's hand, and received by Mr. Nervourn sometime previous to his death, stat- ing tlat his son (Clarence,) who had been ungener- ously treated, was innocent of writing a certain let- ter which he (the father) had already received, doubt- less, wherein was penned his intention of never again revisiting his native land, and many other things of sf   291 a wicked, cruel nature, which it is unnecessary to rehearse. It appears that Captain Nervourn had faith in the belief that he should behold the beloved features of his son once more before he died; but the glimmering lanmp of life refused to linger until this period. It was an unspeakable comfort to the dying parent to be undeceived in regard to his excel- lent sonl. Mr. Nervourn left a large amount of property for his son, whenever he should return to take possession of it. After looking over the papers of his deceased parent, Clarence found that there was much to attend to, concerning the settlement of his father's estate: consequently he was obliged to protract his absence- from Pyrone Mansion, in order to accomplish some of these momentous affairs. Sealed packages were' found in Mr. Nervourn's desk, containing things of importance. The ufnsealing of these, and the peru- sal of the papers aroused intense feelings within the breast of Clarence.- He had long thought that- there was some mystery connected with his father's life. A strange presentiment took possession of his feelings; a dark foreshadowing that he should find- mysterious divulgements within the sealed packages. As delays are dangerous, he resolved upon unsealing the largest of these on the ensuing evening. Doubtless every reader who has perused this vol- ume will remember the tragical death of Alfred Sherford. At the time that this horrible deed was perpetrated, dark surmises and silent shud(deringD, were manifested among the majority of the people about this region. In their hearts the people believed that the murder had been artfully committed.  In one of the above-mentioned  packets Clarence- found a full confessions of the nefarious deed. - A brief abstract from this letter will suffice to give the  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7571-00000146"/> 292 reader some idea of the whole. It ran as follows :- "My son, I cannot die with a certain load of guilt weighing upon my soul."   He then went on with a story which we will now give in our own words. The Italian servant, whom we have already men- tioned, was commissioned by his master (Mr. Ner- Yourn) to shoot his rival Alfred Sherford, under pre- tence of discharging his fowling-piece by accident. But just before emerging from the skirt of the for- est, where the party had been hunting, the span- iard hastened towards his servant, who was a little in advance, stating that he had altered his mind in regard to firing upon Mr. Sherford; -adding:,- ,'Instead of doing that which I commanded you to do, you are to discharge your piece here!" But the artful servant, believing that his master's change of minid arose from a few'conscientious scru- ples, and that, in reality, he wished to be rid of his deadly rival, thought he might confer a great favor upon said master by following his firstcdirections. The heart of this wretch was a blood thirsty one, utterly devoid of humane feeling. At  last there was an opportunity, and at a dread interval the deaf- ening  report of a gun was heard. As the smoke cleared, the groans- of the victim were heard. "( Oh, my son!" wrote the father, , it caused a still deeper groan of anguish in my guilty soul. My God! did I   not bid my servant to stay his hand? But Clarence, the deed was done. The heart of your father was struck with the unparalleled beauty and amiability of the noble being who afterwards became my wife, and vour mother, my boy. "The Italian absconded under the cover of the smoke and confusion. Search was made for him, but it was of no avail. Some years since I  read of   293 a furious Italian in Savannah, who had escaped from prison; and soon after got into a fight with a few half-intoxicated sailors, was stabbed through the heart from which wound he died instantly. Doubt- less he was the wretch who was once my servant. "Long did I bend over the uncomplaining Alfred. The paleness and anguish of his betrothed bride sent deep-poisoned arrows through my guilty soul. Though I strove by every means in my power to mitigate his sufferings, and prolong his life, it was of, no avail; the wounded Alfred could not live. It was the general opinion of the inhabitants of the neighborhood that he had met his death through the blundering carelessness of my servant. It was my opinion that he was naturally a murderous scoundrel, and I fear had we met that there would have been a serious settling between us. I am now thankful that no such meeting took place. "My  ends were accomplished. The beautiful Mary Pyrone became my adored wife.  Oh! how her pure noble nature would have loathed her hus- band had she known the foul stain which, like a mon- ster weight, was dragging my soul into the abyss of woe. "My son, will you forgive your father the cruel words that I had with you upon the ground of your frequent visits to Pyrone Mansion? No wonder that my heart shrank from the idea of your becom- ing intimate with the persons of that house. Dea- con Pyrone was your mother's uncle. The impart- ing of the knowledge of this relationship was stren- uously avoided by your father, Clarence. The foul deed was not perpetrated in New Hampshire, but in Vermont where  my wife's parents then resided. Afterwards they removed to the mansion. "My absent-my only child! a halo of perma-  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7571-00000147"/> 294 nent Joy sheds its beams o'er- my soul. Yes, this unfading joy exists in the assurance that the chaste spirit of your mother often. looks upon her erring husband with a seraphic smile resting upon her fea- tures, and her notes wafted to the upper courts. "My son, youw have pursued life's journey thus far as one who knows that there is a just Rewarder of good and evil; One who inhabits the heavens, but reigneth alike upon earth. Keep steadily on in your march. Never swerve from your duty to God and your fellow-men. Perhaps, my son, you may think that the admonition. of such a father as I have been, however good and wise, will prove of little ben- efit to you. But I know that I have been the sub- ject of many of your petitions to God. Oh, how happy and rejoiced is my heart to learn that a cer- tain cruel letter which came to me was never penned by you my injured son!   May God forgive your unjust- enemies, whoever they may be. Your letter reached me by the last mail, stating that you were already on your journey homeward. Father of mer- cies, grant that I may survive to behold my son--my only child! I am well aware that my life is rapidly ebbing away. My physician tells me that I cannot survive much longer. "There is one thing, Clarence, that I wish to men- tion.  There- is a beautiful miniature of vour mother somewhere in the Pyrone Mansion.  It was deposited in a curiously-wrought shell box. It is the identical one that Alfred Sherford had yin his possession long before he:"died.  There were two  miniatures of Alfred; off of which is: in my possession, the other is at the mansion. "One day after my marriage, previous to our removal from the mansion, I found my wife standing by a window, gazing intently upon two miniatures.   295 My heart was instantly fired with jealousy, for I recognized the features of the person. My wife was so deeply absorbed in gloom that she did not heed my approach. Looking over her shoulder, I saw that one of these was a picture of herself, and the other an accurate likeness of Alfred Sherford, her lover of other days. In a frenzy of unutterable despair I snatched one of them from the grasp of my gentle companion, and I remember secreting it in an old chest in the large garret. Aferwards I came across the other, which was the miniature of my dead victim. My mind was calmer now, so I merely looked at it, and replaced it where I had found it. I wondered at the time why my heart was so calm, but I think that I had sincerely repented of my guilty acts, and the balm of forgiveness had been poured into my heart. The last named miniature is now snugly secured in one of these packages which will be delivered to you by my faithful physician, if you do not reach home before my death. My side is excruciatingly painful, but I trust that I may not murmur. "You will find a letter directed to Miss Amelia Pyrone, also one for your dear friend Miss Elisiner Hovert. Clarence, I have never beheld this lady but once; but if countenance is an index of her mind, you will be blessed iq your intended union with her. So much lovliness and purity! In years past I was somewhat acquainted with this lady's relatives. - Readers, we have extracted a very brief amount from this letter, not deeming it of material conse- quence. "Faithful until death i" These' words continually haunted the mind' of Eli-  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7571-00000148"/> 296 siner. There seemed to'be some magic influence in this one short sentence. We refer to the evening when we left our young friend sitting by the window in her favourite East chamber. We said that one hand rested upon some faded flowerets. Apart from these mentioned, were some that Clarence had given her, whilst they were standing in the conservatory at her mother's resi- dence, only a short time before his departure from home. He then stood with his arm encirclilg the form of his affianced bride, with the blooming flowers which he had just culled from the dainty pots which stood in the bay-window, whilst he fondly breathed these words; . Faithful until death!" The other faded flowers were the same which Elisiner had gathered for her little cousin Dora, just before her death. -These she had pressed and perfumed in remembrance of that sad occasion. Elly's reverie was soon interrupted by Amelia's gentle tones, requesting her to go down to her. "Yes, mamma, come down this minute--come!"  shouted little Herbert. A group of dear friends were wending their way up the west yard. There was Lawrence Hovert and his young wife, Elbur Lenson and Lunette, and Willie Fosdick and Hattie Williams. In a-few days the mansion was visited by another welcome guest, whom   all were rejoiced to meet. There was one in this circle whose heart thrilled with emotions as she met this noble friend. An awakening of other days was stirred into remem- brance. Yet not a word was breathed by this newly- arrived friend, concerning the deep, unfathomed fount of love. It is true that these waters had Ceased their restless gushings, though they were deeper, if possible, than formerly. Had not Elisiner   297 suffered through the same agency as himself! Their hearts had ached from  the same sorrowful cause. And now Clarence has returned, and finds her all purity and devotion, the same as of old. How calmly beautiful did she appear upon one evening, as they sat alone in the same apartment where they had plighted their early vows, when the gentle maid- en, scarcely fifteen, nestled so confidingly upon his manly shoulder. Reader we will leave our friends alone to converse upon the subjects which lie nearest their hearts, whilst we look after the rest of the household. We find the family enjoying sweet repose in their several apartments, therefore we will tarry in the long hall to watch the glorious, mellow light of the queenly moon, as she sails in her silvery car. Morning is ushered in with considerable bustle. The little chapel in the village is decked - with ever- green, and. ornamented with festoons of flowers. AVhat is the cause of this joyous commotion? We will hasten to the chapel. It is well for us that we have done so, for at the foot of the alter stand two blushing brides. The first is Miss Hattie Williams, and beside her a tall, interesting, young man, whom we recognize as Dr. Willie Fosdick. The long veil of the other bride is turned a trifle aside, and we see the mild, pleasant countenance of Lunette Hovert, and by her side is a noble, dark-eyed young gentle- man who is no other than our merry friend Elbur Lenson. These happy playmates have emerged from the years of boyhood and girlhood, but the same sun- ny countenances are seen now, as in the days when they played hidesand-go-seek around the old mansion, and down the long lane, through the orchard, with Old Tiger in advance. It is true that Lunette's twin sister, Annette, did  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7571-00000149"/> 298 not make one of the happy group; but after old Winter has approached, and young Spring has loos- ened the ice-bound brooks, and awakened the sweet May-flowers from their brown beds, this dear sister and Professor Eldredlge were to be united. Clarence remained long after the bridal parties had dispersed. The venerable pastor was fast passing away; his earthly pilgrimage was well nigh ended. He had been a faithful shepherd over a small flock in his Master's vineyard. Clarence supplied his place in the sacred desk many times during the Winter, remaining for a greater part of the time with the clergyman. Towards Spring he resigned his office. Many were the tears that were shed for this dearly- 'beloved pastor. Indeed, he had ever proved himself a faithful father to his people. One day towards the close of Marich, Benson returned from the East Indies, where he had gone to seek his fortune. He was greatly pleased to behold his native shores once more. He had obtained but little in comparison to that which he had anticipated before setting out upon this expedition. He wished to fill his old place on the Pyrone farm: and as Mr. Sherford was intending to move on to his own farm in ia short time, Benson was reinstalled in his own place. HAunt Nell rejoiced that the whole family was to- gether once more;  whilst Old Phil rolled his eye- balls, and said, reverentially ;- ,   "De Lor' be bressed! dis ole black heart be awful happy now dat all the bressed children hab come home again! Me bery happy-haw! haw! Then addressing himself to Sally, who was attend- ing to Hiram  Bank's wants, he continued; "Sally we knows a ting or two, don't we?" Then going towards the woodshed-door, he murmur-   239 ed something about young ministers and their ladien. "Well done I ef I don't declare!" ejaculated Aunt Nell, turning towards Elisiner. "- Enybody 'ud think that Phil had a notion o' turning minister himself, for he jabbers about nothin' else from morning till night, but--" "But what?" asked Hiram, roguishy, as he twirled a sprig of evergreen over Sally's head. Elisiner looked a little confused, as she observed :- "Why, how loquacious you all have grown! Hiram, I should think that your wounded finger ought to keep you in a quiet mood." ("Oh well, Mrs. Elwell, my finger was mutilated in a good cause, as I was getting some birch for Miss Sally here." The long winter evenings at the mansion had been beguiled of their wearisomeness by pleasant, edifying conversation. Rev. Clarence Nervourn possessed su- perior conversational abilities. Mrs. Pyrone's deport- ment towards this gentleman had become greatly ameliorated. Altogether, she appeared to dwell in a different sphere from the one which she had occupied a few years since. Her heart had been tried and become purified. The childish glee of Herbert and lit- tle Gracie greatly enlivened the fireside of this happy household. On the first of April, Elbur Lenson and his young wife came to Lenson Cottage to make it his perma- nent home. An extension to the farm had been recentlI made, through the agency of his wealthy uncle, MRajor Elwell, so that Elbur had sufficient ground for displaying his taste and ingenuity. At the close- of a certain day Mrs. Pyrone was 'detained from appearing at the supper-table by a try- ing headache. Elisiner had attended her, and admin- istered to her wants during the day. Once she was ;  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7571-00000150"/> 300 startled by hearing frequent sobs from the sick wo- man. It was evident that the old lady was laboring under some mental oppression. Several times slie ,had attempted to speak, but seemed unable to control herself sufficiently. "( Do not weep, dear aunt," said Elly. in a soothing tone, ",you will soon get! rid of this troublesome pain. Here is some tea that I have brought for you.  The invalid lifted the cup to her lips, but a new outhurst of grief prevented her drinking. Upon lying down, she became sufficiently calm to proceed. Ere long she whispered:-- "Elly my dear, my kind, patient child, I have a few words of importance to communicate to you. My own repose of mind requires that I should unfold these facts.' The aunt seemed greatly agitated.       In two hours, when Elisiner left her. aunt, deep - traces of grief were visible upon her face. What she had learned during the conference, we do not know. A' few evenings afterward, when Clarence and his affianced were conversing, something was said con- cerning a certain cruel letter which had been found. Both seemed deeply moved. ,Perfidity! Crueltye!" exclaimed Mr. Nervourn, Enough was said, however, to convince one that the mysterious letter in question was none other than that iw hich Elbur Lenson's dog Ponto had rescued from behind the secretary several years since, when Elisi- ner was visiting at the little brown cottage. Some- thing was also said about another letter and many other dark transactions were confessed. We are len- ient enough to believe, that however wrong Lady Pyrone may have acted she had now repented; and full -reconciliation took place between those wronged and herself.   301 Mr. Nervourn was urged to being the pastor of the little parish in this neighborhood. He accepted the call. As the little chapel was too small to accommo- date the fast increasing congregation, a plan was made of enlarging the place of worship. 'Many pretty houses and two stores had been erected in the vicinity, within a few years. No woodman's axe had yet felled the beautiful grove of beech and maple which had stood up so proudly, long before the little dell had been peopled. Clarence sought Dr. Hovert to see if that gentle- man had any objections to bestowing the hand of his fair daughter Elisiner .on himself. The answer to this question was such as to cause a sensation of unspeakable joy to thrill through every fibre of the young man's heart. "( My friendy 'said the doctor, "I feel the greatest' pleasure in bestowing the hand of my dearly-beloved daughter upon one whom I consider worthy of her in every respect." After some necessary peliminaries, it was concluded that the marriage of Clarence and Elisiner should take place in three weeks from the time just men- tioned. Each one ati the mansion was ready and willing to lend a helping hand about the extensive preparations. An undercurrent of melancholy silently coursed its way through the heart of our extremely sensitive heroine yet. She strove not to dim the happiness of any one, or to freeze up the tide of pleasant conver- sation. Some days previous to the nuptials, quite a large number of guests arrived. In the meantime, the old garret was quite a resort for the curious, and each person requested Mrs. Pyrone to give them something in it, as a memento of the occasion. Mrs. Kate Hva- 26 i   &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7571-00000151"/> 302 ert chose the old tattered sofa, the same whereon- she had often sat, by Elisiner's side, whilst both perused the manuscript of the old African woman. A bird- cage, a pair of tongs and a shovel were presented to Elbur and Lunette. Mrs. Nervourn selected some old fashioned chairs. These with many other articles of -cast-off furniture, - were sent to the cabinet-makelrs, and a few months later you might have seen them tastily arranged about a certain neat apartment. The two old arm-chairs were reverentially placed either side of the fireplace, the brass-headed nails in the cushion laughing out at you as you approached them. These chairs were placed in the study of the young clergyman. The old secretary which has been so often presented to the inspection of our readers, as a res- ervoir for so many mysteries, accompanied the train of, chairs to the cabinet-makers. Doubtless the west room, where these articles were to be arranged, would make a pretty and snug retreat for the young bride., The old tower underwent a thorough reparation, and the decayed steps leading to it' were rebuilt. Everything in and about the house was repaired and put in order. Cobwebs and dust disappeared under the destructive broom weilded by Sally. Aunt Nell was set upon having the old pines in the fireplace replaced by new ones; saying that "the dear young ladies (Elisiner and Kitty)had taken a heap o' comfort sitting around the blazing fire, reading over those old books and papers." Doubtless she thought of the dying stranger too, for she-cast her moistening eyes towards the -cot-bed whereon he' had died. The parents of Hiram Banks still reside by the side of the sweet murmuring stream. The aristo- cratic Lady Pyrone no longer scowls when she meets Hiram, but always has a pleasant smile for him.   303 The property which Clarence inherited at his fath- er's death, was small in comparison with that which Elisiner received at her husbands hands, the gift of the generous Major Elwell. With a part of this wealth Clarence was enabled to purchase the entire Pyrone estate, and many laborers were employed in remodelling the grounds. At length the auspicious day arrived ; the day that was to witness the nuptials of Clarence Nervourn with the deserving object of his heart's devotion, for many a long year. The feathered songsters warbled forth their notes in the old apple trees, answering love-calls to one another. The tiny heads of blush- ing rose-buds peeped from between their full-blown, antecedents. Tame squirrels ran up and down the elms and maples. Old Tiger, whose sight was entire- ly gone, still retained his keen instinct, insomuch that he felt as though the numerous guests now a-ssembled at Nervourn Mansion, were most of them his own fa- miliar friends. He was soon a great favorite with all, and was frequently equipped by tiny busy hands with cap or sun-bonnet, for the juveniles in attendance knew that something agreeable was in store for them, so Tiger must be dressed as well asthey, and the' do- cile animal submitted with good grace to their amuse- ments. The Rev. Mr. Alston was to officiate at the nup- tials and a chum of the bridegroom's was to be in ato tendance also. The large parlors were filld to over- flowing. Dr. Hovert gave the bride away. We think that a more interesting couple never greeted the eyes of an audience. Nobleness and innocence, with every-- adorning virtue, were blended in the charcters- ot- this newly-wedded pair. The remarks of the venetabli^ clergyman were very pleasing and appropriate.  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7571-00000152"/> 804 Mr. Elbur Lenson and his bride accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Nervourn upon their bridal tour to New York. Here the bride and her noble husband were received with unfeigned joy by the early friends of the former. The weather proving unusually fine, they visited the Catskills, and Saratoga Springs, Here, Mrs. Nervourn met many friends of long ago, and those, too, whom her heart had fondly loved in the days of her childhood and youth. They also visited a little cosy village, snugly nes- tled, upon the banks of the notle Hudson, where Elisiner, in company with her father and brother, bad often repaired in other days, the days of "' auld lang syne." When Mr. and Mrs. Nervourn arrived at their home, they learned that there had been visitors in their absence. One of Clarence's college churns had supplied his pulpit during his tour. Some days were devoted to paying and receiving calls. Mr. Nervourn had built a pleasant arbor in the vicinity of the little lakelet, and by general invita- tion the children of the congregation congregated here for a fine time. They played, and walked, and skipped down the lane, through the orchard, past the red gate and onward to the beautiful clump of maples near the margin of this little silvery lake. How cheering to the hearts of the children! How pleasant after the many storms of life, were these days to the young married, pair! But the- storms of life are continually gathering about the pathway's of earth's children. One fine afternoon, some time after their return, Mr. and Mrs. Nervourn stole away by themselves to the little East garret. Here, nearly every article of   805 furniture remained' in its original place. Here stood the same little table with its books; there the larger round table, which Elisiner and Kitty frequently used for a seat; the box of newspapers in the corner--one or two low stools, and a bureau wherein numerous small trinkets were deposited, which Elisiner had se- lected from the rubbish in the large garret. Clarence and Elisi'ner seated themselves upon a de- faced sofa, whilst the former narrated many things relative to his deceased father, which had come to his knowledge during his long absence. i"My own precious wife!" exclaimed the young husband, fervantly;, "my noble companion!  the whirling bark of fate has, by the divine interposition of Providence, brought us into this happy port." As Elisiner raised her head from the shoulder of her husband, she met loving glances from his dark eyes. Those eyes! how she loved, for hours to pene- trate their clear depths, to read true loving senten- ces. The eves are the herald of the soul. The mighty stirrings of the heart's sanctuary are imprinted upon the eyes. If all is right within, and the reader be of a penetrating, appreciative nature, beautiful indeed is the perusal and study of these types of the mind. So thought our amiable young Elisiner Nervourn. We must admit, however, that the mind, or rather the power of the mind, has such unbounded control over the internal feelings, that full-grown resolves and long-predicted plans are never allowed to be- come visible; either by .the silent language of the eye, or by the brightening of the features. Through the bright, speaking orbs shines forth the depth of the soul's motive. ^   u "My dear Elly, there is one thing about which I - ahould like to become enlightened." ';  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7571-00000153"/> What may it be?  demanded his attentive lis- tener. G'A miniature of my mother." "( Some years since I was whiling away a few hours of leisure, when I unexpectedly camine across the min- iature of a lovely unknown lady whom I suppose t, be your mother." Stepping from the side of her husband, Mrs. Ner- vourn left the apartment; but soon returned, bearing in her hand a small shell-box, Which she presented to Clarence. After gazing upon it for a short timei with considerable emotion, he exclaimed:- ... ' How very beautiful! how expressive! And this lock of hair--" Do you not know--" commnenced Elisiner, "carn you not feel instinctively that Iot are looking upon, the portrait of your own sainted mother?"  "Oh Elly! if you know do not keep me in sus-j pense!" He gazed still more intently upon the opened pie- ture, then raised his eyes from it; he needed nothing further to confirm his belief of the identity, than the resemblance existing 'betweei this and the full-sized portrait which, in. his younger days, hung in his fath- ir'6s homle. Doubtiag no longer, tea4s of calm sub- duaed grief were sent up from the fountain of issoul to his dark, speaking ey'es. Long did thiis interesting pair sit in the cosy re- treat; a sw6eet :solemnity seemed to pervade the very atmosphere. Something weas heard, like a whispered echo 'from the tomb. Then a gentle, sweeping breeze Wafted the voice away, 'giving place to the 'nkild rai-d ance of :youth. Bright, beautiful light--.hen deeo heart-woes! then the fragrance of the heartos ;eary iose, fraught with :ttie dews of a holy iawaiteniiing  Last, and the most subliie, tiiascenditily aVitifuai   -307 is the pare religion! All--yes, all, have been visi- tants to our herinein her hours of lonliness in this sanctum. Long after the dewey freshness of evening stole inC through the vine-clad window, and the pale beams of the moon glanced in through the shadowy tendrils of the twining woodbine, did these friends linger, enjoy- ing the old familiar scenes  feeling in their hearts that the clouds of gloom, as those of happiness, are transitory. Clarence still retained the shell-box, also a faded rose; the one which Elisiner had severed from a vase standing upon the table, on the morning previous to her lover's departure for L---- .  It became to him a cherished memento of her love.   After pressing and peirfuming this sweet though    faded flower, it had been placed in this shell-box, wherein it had lain until now brought forth.  When first unclasping the box, Mr. Nervourn had noticed the flower, but -so in" tently'was his attention fixed upon the miniature below it, that he did not mention his thoughts con- cerning it until both were :replaced. There appeared to be a mysterious link subsisting between these relicS--the miniature and the rose. Clarence observed th-at the mild blue eyes of his tain'ted 'tmother seemtned ;to follow the faded 'rose, :as it was removed from its usual place of security. "Dear mother!" he gently murmured, "Deiarmo; ther! I seem te feel:thy warm caress, Thiy loving tins:are iiiigering n'ear, In thy maternal arms my infant form was pressed, Love and beauty danced on thy youthful cheek. 'My owiswe6t 'ni6ther!") "But ere I le'rhed thi name to llap, Thy btr ighit piriiit .wa's bournme away, : Thou didst leave thy-oherItshed on alone, Filled with childish wonder at thy IonSg tay, . /. 'Diar nmoi er! ..... *   .   ,   &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7571-00000154"/> 808 The sound of wheels was heard in the North avenue, warning our friends of the approach of visitors. Lit- tle Herbert had been sleeping for the last half hour, with his curly head-resting on the lap of *he good Aunt Pyrone. As he was now fully awake, he hur- ried up the stairs, calling loudly for his mamma to go below. ' Tumrn down, mamma, tum down!" cried out Her- bert, in his coaxing language. "A tall gentleman, papa, and, he looks just like you do, when you take them little shining things away from your eyes; and a lady who looks like mamma, only not so pretty!" "You're right, my son!" said Mr. Nervourn smil- ingly, as he patted the little fellow's curly head. Elisiner preceded her husband down the stairs, and reached the parlor first. The blending of voices in sweet congratulations, the introduction of Rev. Mr. Nervourn to the strangers, and Master Herbert's childish manifestations of joy, must have been very pleasing. Now readers cannot you think who these friends are? It is our old friend Foresetta, and her noble husband Captain Dunbar. They had come for the purpose of making our friends a visit. Joyous hearts leaped, and sent forth loving words; and it was not until the mahogany clock told a late hour, that they retired. Mrs. Dunbar was the dearest friend of Elisiner Nervourn, whilst a resident of the romantic spot in ----  ; and within the precincts of this place, we first introduced our friends to the reader. Foresetta had since married Captain Dunbar, and this evening was the anniversary of their marriage. And now they had met, and joined in loving, social intercourse. Now and then there was a pause, when memory awakened buried thoughts, and pointed to /   309 scenes long past. Now a sombre shade nestles o'er a lonely grave! and a sigh is lent to the evening breeze. Hope taps mockingly at the heart's door, and the mourner bows in mute despair. And now  comes Faith with uplifted eye, and points to yon radiant heaven, whispering:- "Afflictions and joys are for the good!" , All is well!' The hour of eleven chimed through the room, and those members of the family who were yet sitting up, were summoned to the square room for evening devotions. The voice of praise and thanksgiving was wafted on the breath of Faith and Love to the upper courts. And now, dear readers, our friends, have retired, and are enjoying sweet refreshing slumber under the gentle wings of Morpheus. We will avail ourselves of the same needed privilege. We will first offer up a mental petition, for its unremitted smile to rest upon us, so that our last earthly couch may be strown with the unfading rose of a good conscience. May the dawning of the same sun of peace which has, and still shines for many of our friends, who have trav- eled with us through the pages of this book, ulti- mately be ours. Now, kind readers, we shake hands with all, and wish you pleasant dreams, and good-night! END.   &#xD;</p>
