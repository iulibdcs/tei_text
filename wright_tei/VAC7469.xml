IN the first place I did not write this Book. It was printed. And the reason I wrote it was simply this: In 1817 my father owned a large peach-orchard in New Jersey. At the same time he owned a yoke of oxen, and a large covered wagon. The wagon was covered by a shed. A simple shed of excellent habit, inasmuch as it covered the wagon.-  At this time my uncle lived in Canada, adjoining the town nearest the one he resided in. He owned a span of horses and a 'garden. It was a covered garden, covered by weeds. There was not-then, and it is safe to presume there is not now any other resemblance between the wagon of my father and the garden of my uncle, than the fact that each was covered. Why this was so I never knew, as the nurse left the day beforehand, so I determined to adopt the wisest course, thinking it would be the best. The result was all I wished, and more. In 1821, the physician moved away, and left the place. My father determined to bind me out as an apprentice to a fine old gentleman whose daughter was-in love with a young man who lived with his father down the river which in the spring-time was so swollen by the rains that it was important not to cross it except in a skiff tied to a buttonwood tree by a chain which cost five dollars at the hardware store on the corner of the street in the village where each Sabbath morning the minister told his many congregation which would have been larger had it not been for the habit so many people had of. staying away from all places of good instruction without which not a single per- son in the village would have been safe for a moment from the members of a band of desperadoes whose retreat was in the bowels of a huge mountain, on whose healthy sides 1*  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7469-00000005"/> 10       Author's  Preface. the birds sang all the day long as if to remind the weary passer-by that in all well-regulated families there exists a cause for the effect be it great like the- late war which was a fearful struggle on both sides for the original position held by the covered wagon of my father. Who can wonder at the infatuation of the youth when he saw his own true love in the power of the Indian whose scalping-knife hung suspended from a tree over the grave where a small picket fence had been erected by a boy who saw the fire burst forth devouring in an hour the fruit of a lifetime of toil which unrewarded leaves no recompense to strengthen the soul of man as he wars with evils that beset the path which led to the trysting-tree which had by this time been cut down to make room for a large hotel where the sound of revelry by night was heard booming over the still waters of the lake as the moon shone down upon the sailor-boy stood on a burning deck! At this moment the breeching gave way and the horse plunged over the precipice, which at this point ran nearly a thousand cubic feet into the cave where the serpent had taken refuge from the coming storm which threatened to burst forth and destroy the entire plan of the temple on which if the workmen had been employed to save the child ere it struck, the bottom of the well down which the bucket descended bringing up the purest ice-water rival- ling the alabaster neck of the wounded sufferer whose death happened to plunge the entire city in mourning. The reader will see at a glance that from this moment, none of us were to blame as the events mentioned will prove. P S.-If this preface does not suit, the resignation of the reader will be accepted whenever he visits the sanctum of the author where the following pages were written merely for that "Little nonsense now and then, Is relished by the wisest men."

IGHT beneath one of our windows, from morn till midnight, we see youngsters and oldsters twisting their legs into all conceivable shapes, skating up and down the river merry as lambs. We cannot pick up a paper but an article on "skating" meets the eye. Everybody says it's fun, and that's all everybody knows about it, for we've tried it. Last night, about gas-light time, after reading  &#xD;<pb n="12" xml:id="VAC7469-00000006"/> 12   Our First Exercise in Skating. a glowing description of life on skates, we pre- pared for our first attempt, and sallied forth to join the merry crowd. We had on a pair of stoga boots, trousers-legs tucked inside, a Robert-tailed coat, and white hat. We went down on the ice, and gave a boy two shillings in good coin of the realm for the use of his im- plements. We have confidence, even as great as Peter's faith. We, with the assistance of a friend, fixed on the skates and stood erect like a barbar's pole. Encouraged by the sight of some ladies on the bridge, who were just then looking at the skaters, we struck out., A slant to the right with the right foot, a slant to the left with the left foot, and just then we saw something on the ice and stooped over to pick it up! On our feet again-two slants to the right and one to the left, accompanied- with a loss of confidence. Another stride with the right foot, and we sat down with fearful rapidity, and very little if any elegance I What a set-down it was, for we made a dent    &#xD;<pb n="Illustration-13" xml:id="VAC7469-00000007"/> n "Mary said  Guess 'taint a handkerchief, Jane, an Mary was right.

Just then one of the ladies remarked, "Oh, look, Mary,.that feller with the white hat ain't got his skates on the right place!"  Ditto, thought we. Just then a ragged little devil sang out, as he glided past us: "Hallo, old timber legs!" and we arose suddenly and put after him, and away went our legs-one to the east and the other to the west--causing an immense fissure in our pants and another picture of a butter-tray in the cold-oh, how cold --ice! Then the lady again spoke, and said, "Oh, look, Mary,- that chap with the white hat has sat down on his handkerchief to keep from taking cold!"We rose about as gracefiilly,as a saw-horse, when Mary said, "Guess 'taint a handkerchief, Jane," and Mary was right. It wan't a handkerchief- not a bit of it. Just then a friend came along and proffered us his coat-tail as a "steadier." We accepted the continuation of his garment,  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7469-00000008"/> "   Our First Exercise in Skating. and up the river we went, about ten, rods, when a shy to the right by the leader, caused us, the wheel-horse, to scoot off on a tangent, heels up! But the ice is very cold this season! We tried it again. A glide one way, a glide and a half the other, when whack came our bump of philoprogenitiveness on the ice, and we saw millions of stars dancing around us, like ballet girls at the Bowery Theatre. How that shock went through our system, and up and down our spinal column! Lightning couldn't have cork- screwed it down a greased sapling with greater speed or more exhilarating effect. Boarding- house butter nor warranty deed could have struck any stronger than we did--and a dozen ladies looking at us and our fissured pants! "Hallo, old cock!" sang out that ragged imp again, and we there helpless. Soon we got up and made another trial with better success. Per- haps we had skated, in our peculiar style, fifteen feet, when a blundering chap eame up behind,   Our First Exerise nM Skcating. 15 and we sat down, with our tired head pillowed in his lap, and he swearing at us, when it was all his fault! How cold the ice was there, tool Every spot where we made our debut on the ice, oh, how cold it was! Our nice bear-skin was no protection at all. We tried again, for the papers all say it's fun, and down came our Roman- Grecian nose on the cold julep material, and the little drops of crimson ran down our shirt-bosom, and on to the cold ice! Once more we tried skating-made for the shore-sat down and counted damages.   Two shillings in cash thrown away; seven lateral and one " fronternal " bumps on the ice; one immense fissure in as handsome a pair of ten-dollar cassi- meres as a man ever put his legs in; one rupture in the knee, extending to the bone; four buttons from our vest; a fragmented watch-crystal, and a back-ache big enough to divide among the chil- dren of Israel!

If any one ever hears of our skating again, they will please draw on us at sight for the bi- valves and accompanying documents. We have got through. .It's a humbug! It's a vexation of spirit, of business, of flesh, and tearer of trousers I It's a head-bumping, back-aching, leg-wearying institution, and we warn people against skating. We tried it, and shan't be able to walk for a month.  Skating clubs are humbugs, and the only reason why the rascally youngsters wish to get the ladies at it, is that they may sec if they, too, don't say " the ice is dreadfully cold!" It's nothing to us, it's nothing to us; but the ladies will do as well to let skates alone, unless they are younger and more elastic than are we!  Oh, how cold the ice is-we can feel it yet!

And yet it is easy- at least for us! This little item is not alone for young beginners, but for the many who go at kissing like hunting coons or shelling corn. First, know who you are to kiss. Don't make a mistake, although a miss take may be good. Don't jump up like a trout for a fly, and sm ek a woman on the neck, the ear, one corner of her forehead, the end of the nose, or slop over on her  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7469-00000010"/> 18      Science of i8ss8ing. waterfall or bonnet-ribbon, in your haste to get through. When God made the world He went slow, and at last pronounced it "very good." Ditto kissing. And morning and night were the first day! It is simple, yet excellent. The gent should be a little the tallest. He should have a clean face, a kind eye, a mouth full of ex- pression, instead of tobacco. Don't kiss all over, as grasshoppers walk. Don't kiss everybody, including nasty little dogs, male or female. Don't sit down to it. Stand up. You need not be anxious to get in a crowd. Two persons are plenty to corner and catch a kiss! More persons spoil the sport! Stand firm. It won't hurt after you are used to it! Take the left hand of the lady in your right hand. Let your hat go to-any place out of the way! Throw the left hand gently over the shoulder of the lady, and let the hand fall down upon her right side, toward the belt. Don't be   Science of .iessing.    19 in a hurry!

Don't be in a hurry    Send a little life down your left arm, and let it know its business. Her left hand is in your right. Let there be expression to your grasp--not like the grip of a vice, but a gentle clasp, full of electri- city, thought, and respect. Don't be in a hurry! Her head lies carelessly on your shoulder! You are nearly heart to heart I Look down into her half-closed eyes! Gently yet manfully press her to your bosom!  Stand firm, and Providence will give you strength for the ordeal! Be brave, but don't be in a hurry I Her lips almost open!  Lean lightly forward with your head-not the body.

No noise-no fuss-no fluttering and squirming, like hook-impaled worm. Kissing don't hurt--does not require a brass band to make it legal. Don't jab down on a beautiful mouth as if spearing for frogs I Don't grab and yank the lady, as if she was a strug- gling colt I Don't muss her hair--scrunch down her collar-bite her cheeks-squizzle her rich ribbons, and leave her mussed, rumpled, and mum-muxed!   Don't flavor your kisses with onions, tobacco, gin cocktails, lager-beer, brandy, etc., for a maudlin kiss is worse than  to a delicate, loving, sensitive woman. Try the above recipe, and, if you do not succeed, for further particulars call on, or write to "Brcx"POMXROY.   CHAPTER III. MOSQUITOES ON A BENDER. GHT before last, in order to sleep, we placed a piece of raw  beefsteak on a plate at the head of our bed. In the morning it was by the mosquitoes sucked as dry of blood as an old sponge, and our skin saved at least two thousand perforations. All about the room, in the morning, were mosquitoes, plethoric with blood, loaded till they could not fly. We killed a few, but the job was too sanguinary, so we left them to their feast. Last night, in order to get even with the sere nading devils, we steeped half a pound of fresh  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7469-00000012"/> 22     Mospquitoes on a Bender. beefsteak in some old rye whiskey, and left it on a plate by the bed. Nothing like being hospita- bly inclined. In ten minutes after the light was extinguished, a swarm of these backbiting bill- posters made an advance movement. One of them caressed us sweetly on the nose-he sent in his bill-there was a slap-a diluted damn--a dead mosquito!  Soon we heard a tremendous buming about the whiskey-soaked beef. The en- tire mosquito family came singing in, and such an opera-good Lord deliver us! But 'they did not disturb us with bites. We fell asleep, to be awakened in ten minutes by the worst mosquito- concert ever editor, mortal, devil, angel, divine, Dutchman, or any other man listened to. We raised a light, and the greatest show of the season was there to be seen. Every mosquito was drunk as a blind fiddler, and such an uproar- ious night as the long-billed whelps had, never was seen before this side of- elah! The worst anltics! Some were playing circus on the plate.   O8ositoe8 on a Bender.     23 One big fellow, with a belly like Falstaff, full of blood and whiskey, was dancilg juba on the Bible, while a fat friend of his lay on her back beating the devil's dream on an invisible tambou- rine, with one hind leg! Two more were wrest- ling on the foot-board of the bedstead, each with his bill stuck fast in the timber. Another was tying the legs of our pants into a bow-knot to fasten about the neck of Anna Dickinson-whose picture hangs against the washstand--while another red-stomached customer was trying to stand on his head in the wash-bowl. All over the room were drunken mosquitoes! One long-billed, gaunt representative, was trying to ram   the mucilage bottle full of newspaper clippings. Another chap was drilling a hole through  a revolver handle, and singing "My Mary Ann;" while still another was limping across the window-sill in search of fresh air, to the agonizing tune of "  Tramp, tramp, tramp!" One little rat of a  skeet was trying to jam the  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7469-00000013"/> 24     Moqsuitoes on a Bender. cock out of Ben. Butler's eye with a tooth-brush, as his picture hung in the room beside that of Kidd, the pirate. A drunken statesman of the mosquito family was talking Russian to a lot of drunken companions, as they lay in a heap on the plate, while another one sat in the handle of our bowie-knife, doubled up with cramp in the stomach, and trying to untie his tail with his bill, which seemed like Lincoln's backbone when Anna Dickinson said it wanted stiffening. He was a sick-looking skeeter, and died in three minutes after we saw him, her, or it, as the case may be. Two others took a bath in the ink- stand. One, with a bill like the devil's narrative, was trying to wind our watch with a pen-wiper, while another died as he was sitting on the rim of a dish in the room, trying to chaunt "Mother, I've come home to die!"Poor skeeter. A nice skeeter, but ( 'twas a pity he drank." An old veteran, with a paunch full of 'alf and 'alf--blood and whiskey-sat on the table, reading Les   Mosuitoes on a Bender.     25 Misdrables, while his wife was under the stove trying to mend her broken wing with a limpsey toothpick. She looked disgusted! Another one combed his hair with a paper of pins, tied a piece of white paper about his neck, pasted a five-cent infernal revenue stamp on his rump-or words to that effect--and died like a " loyal" citizen. His last words were- "Tell the traitors all aroand you," etc., etc. Another drunken scamp started out of the window   for John B. Gough, or  a stomach- pump. A worse behaved set of bummers we never saw.   They acted fearfully. About two thousand lay aromund dead, but sadness seemed not to break in upon their hilarious rioting upon blood and whiskey. ITalf-a-dozen of them sat on our new   hat playing draw-poker, using worm  lozenges for  checks, while one of the party got clean busted by making a fifty- dollar blind good on a four-flush, which didn't 2  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7469-00000014"/> 26    rlospuitoes on a Bender. fill! He will be apt to wear cotton socks next winter, and keep away from church collection days. Another one sat on top of a brandy bot- tle, reading "Baxter's Call to the Unconverted," while his partner lay dead at his feet, evidently forced to close doors by the failure of Ketchum &amp; Son, of New York! Six others were trying to hang one that looked like a Copperhead, to the corner of a match-safe; but as they were drunk and he sober, it was not safe to bet on his being dangled. They ate the beef, drank the blood and whiskey, drilled the plate full of holes, and on the centre-table organized a Son of Malta lodge, using a five-cent shin-plaster for blanket in the act entitled "The Elevation of Man." Another red-bellied leader of the Miss Keeter family had a battalion of drunken bummers on the edge of a spittoon watching him jam a fur overcoat into his left ear.

OVED a milkmaid, Miranda by cog- nomen, and she was the quickest milkist that ever squatted garter-holders under the dripping eaves of a patient bovine on a day of rain, and sich. She was handsome.  Her mother was a handsome cuss, and her father was a blessing in disguise, with mien like an angel and hair colored like a New Jersey barn. Miranda lived in New England.

But Miranda wan't like him. She milked the cows and strained the milk. I used to help her. We were both boys-that is, I was a boy, then. I was green, but pure. Ditto Miran. She was tall. She was long for this world. She was fat as a toothpick. She had a neck like a bottle of Worcester sauce. She was slim as the salary of a country minister, or the wardrobe of a country editor washing-day. And didn't I sling love into her lap? You bet!

How could we help it?  Her mother was opposed to the match. She thought Miranda wan't good enough for me. I had the poverty. It struck in before I 'struck out. Be- ing poor, I was good; hence the objection. So we courted syruptastingly, and met in the barn- yard the usual way-through the back gate. Every night I veni'd and vidi'd. Her mother used to catch us at it. She enticed Miranda into bedrooms, cellars, pantries, and closets, and there confined her before her time came for going out to milk. But we often circumvented the aged matron. We changed clothes with the hired man, and went in on our nerve. Miranda loved. "Brick" loved. But we had hard times of it. Affection gurgles as it runs.

We used to wander after beech-nuts, and the old lady was there. We sallied forth to gather shells of ocean-as we called hen's eggs-in the hay-mow, and behold I the old lady was there. We went forth hand in hand, like the ghost of John Brown and*that other man, in search of a love-lit bower, and behold! there appeared the aged who first knew Miranda, and bade us return. She was an agile mother. We sat under the window to compare our tales of love, and Mi- randa's mother inflicted shower-baths upon us the while. We attended funerals in order to have fun, but behold she was there, and our fun came not to pass. At times I rode the family horse by the window at stated periods when Mi- randa was to be there, and the voice of my milk- maid's maternal was always saying, "Let's see how fast you dare ride!

Miranda had the things she inherited, such as geese, the little store, the cheese rinds, the war- bling ducks, and all sich of the estate, and threw open the shutters of her heart. I popped in. The front room thereof was vacant. I slung in my traps, crawled in at the window, took pos- session, sang a song of joy, kissed my milkmaid on her dinner-catcher, sold my disappointment for a yellow necktie, and became an altered man, fill of joy where sorrow had so lately nestled.

I sat her down under the par- ]or window, in a rose-bush, that the crowd might not see "the charms her downcast modesty," etc., failed to conceal. Then I ran back to get her things, spread in five chairs at the foot of the bed and lying in circles on the floor. I got them. Nine armsful when I had them all.

I puffed my front- hair, slung my waterfall on my bump of obsti- nacy, hoisted an onion into the reticule I car- ried on the left arm, shouldered a green cotton umbrella, took a piece of red flannel to make a shirt for some little innocent bud on the tree of Abolitionism, and sallied forth, as the Yankee clock struck two. Mrs. Sniveller was in.

And they had nice things. And we believe a nigger baby is of more account than a white pauper in the North. And my husband, Deacon Snivellerj wants more bones to mnake buttons of; he'll sell the buttons to the South and West, and they will have to pay us New England Christians for the privilege of wearing out their own bones."

He was the individual as what had the sylph I sparked. Biluria was his dart. And a nice darter she were. She had a mother-a nice lump of lean, who wore a peaked nose, a pair of black stockings, knit springy at the top to save garters, and for twenty-five years went about the   Biluria Bdkiqs and or Cowtship. 49 house before going to bed, clad like an angel, with a fire-shovel in one hand and-a tallow-dip in the other, looking to see as how as if that ere dod-derned cat had concluded to stay in or to go out. I don't like cats, except in fiddle-strings. Mrs. Bulkins was a vehement catist-she always had more cats than doughnuts in the house. Biluria' didn't hanker after cats, but then could endure them. There was one cat-Mr. T. Cat. He was a handsome and a feline rascal. He devastated milk-pans, and created funerals in hen-coops about young chicken time, and made a telescope of his tail every moonlight night on the roof of the woodshed, accompanied by more cat and much yell. He was the only feline Biluria could endure. Gushing Biluria! She used to sit up nights when I went to spark her, with that blessed, c-a-t in her lap, right where my head ought to be, and pull its little slender whiskers. Said 1: "Biluria, do so by mel" Said Biluria: "Oh, your wiskers ain't big enough 3  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7469-00000027"/> 50   Biluria Bulkins and our Courtship. to pull, yet." Then we'd eat a doughnut, and drink some cider, and look in the fire. Then I'd listen to the snoring of the two Bulkinses in the setting-room bedroom, and Biluria would sit and play with the cat's tail. Said I: "Bil- uria, do so!" No, I didn't say so, neither; I just said: "Biluria, if you don't diminish those cat on them floor, I'll occupy them lips for a kiss!" And down always went the cat, and I occupied Biluria, so to speak, and kissing was thus enjoyed. '"Twas nice!"It weakens me now to think of it. To turn one of Biluria's kisses over in the store-room of memory is no fool of a job. Biluria had red lips, and the sweetest ever investigated. I used to investigate them. Is was the committee to do that are. My arms were my credentials. I used to hold out my credentials. Skirmish to the front, throw out my pickets, rally to the breastworks of affec- tion, tie my credentials about Biluria's bread- basket, and go in radically for a lover's kiss.   Biluria Bulkins and our  Uozm tshi. b1 Oh! I guess notl Biluria was the sweetest kisser in the world, except when she'd been eating onions. She was a Wethersfield girl--a Connecticut child of sorrow-and oft did fill her pancake-trap with onions. At those times the nectar of love was a little strong-too strong to gush much.  But 'at other times 'twas no use talking. Why, one of her kisses would last me a week, if I couldn't get more! They used to gush out all over, run down my shirt bosom into my vest pocket, and solidify like candy. I used to bite them off, there, as from little sticks of candy. I could not always be with Biluria. I had the wood to cut, the cows to fodder, the sheep to corn, the hens to roost, the swine to feast, the steers to chase away from the wheat-stack, and the apples to sort, and this kept me from Biluria. But while I was hence from her, she made up kisses, ripened them on her lips, and left them hanging there for me to pluck.

He was thunder-struck quitely when he came to. He was naturally a jokist, so from a warm room he entered into the outer air for an icicle to gently touch the old lady and Biluria where my " love lies dreaming."

He didn't want to die in the winter, for it was more expensive to open the earth, then. He was near sighted, but at last he saw something. lHe re- marked but little. He said, perhaps we had bet- ter wed. He was facetious, even in his agony. He said: " [My two B.'s, if it must B so, let it B so, though I don't see how it can be. Send for a minister, and a mature almanac." Bnlkins left soon after. We marched forth with him in March. Mrs. Bulkins lingered and went also. We inserted her by the side of the other Bul- kins.

It is the " hub of the universe,' and the dwelling- place of the big organ. Boston thinks she is the largest place in this world--or the next. Boston is a very complacent burg.

A gentleman in the seat with us uncovered his bald head, and, with a smile, bade us iisten! "What's that " said we. "The big organ in Boston!" said he, with a funeralic wave of his hand. "The devil!" said we. "Thou shalt not profane!" said the spokes- man from the hub. "Hast been to Boston . " asked he of the silver tongue. "We hast notist," replied we, then there to   ( him. He looked--"poor heathen!"  He said we must visit the Cradle of Liberty. We asked him if Fred Douglass and Anna Dickinson had engaged that cradle yet? He didn't see it! He said we must visit Faneuil Hall. We asked him what nigger troupe was performing there now8   B-o-s-t-in-!       65 He looked bewildered. Then he said we must see where Warren fell. We asked him if War- ren ever got over it-the place where he fell. He appeared demoralized.  He said we must hear the big organ before we left Boston. We went to hear the big organ. It is held in several buildings. It is one size larger than :Boston. Bositon is the hub around which the organ revolves. The organ is a revolver. Like the organ, this is a big play on words. People in lNew York and Buffalo hear the moan of the sea. The moan is the big or- gan. It is used in mass I It hav'aa sort of long island sound! Boston people go to Heaven through the big organ. That is, when the nigger is out, so they cannot go through him.  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7469-00000035"/> "       B-o-e-to-n-! There are but few gambling-houses in Boston. No such felloes are around that hub. They don't play "straits" in Boston-not in the streets. Harvard College is just beyond reach of the big organ. Cambridge University is always in session. It is a law school. The pleading is done at the bar of the Parker House, The studies at Cambridge are said to be very dry. They affect the pupils. Pleading at the bar affects them, likewise-or more like than wise. No one ever gets lost in Boston. The city is so well organ-ized. Like the big organ, Boston has numerous stops!  Some of the streets are nearly as long as a fish-pole; but not so long as a Johnson veto message. If a man don't like one street in Boston, it is easy to get on another one. After four days' trial we could go from the   ' Bo-s-t o-r!      67 Parker House to the City Hall without getting lost! This is a fact. And in five days we learned the route from -Scollay's Building to Engine House No. 4. The business blocks in Boston are in shape like Norwegian shoes! The streets of Boston are like hop-poles struck by lightning. Some of them are so wide that a cow could be milked in them by turning her on her back, and sitting astride her brisket. Small horses are driven abreast-large horses tandem-in Boston. The fat woman was exhib- ited there once-in the big organ. Boston streets are not so crooked as they might be. The sun has warped them straight. Very clean in Boston. If a lady drops a pin from her clothes, policeman makes her pick it up. If a man shoots an apple seed out of a grocery, he is fined. Bos- ton is very neat--especially near the big organ and cradle of liberty. If a man drops a remark, he is made to pick it up. And Boston people  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7469-00000036"/> 68       B-o-s-o-n-! are so modest. They under-rate themselves ter- ribly. The streets of Boston must have been thrown in at the time of some big fire-they are so regular. If you would find any place, start in an opposite direction. If you see a policeman coming towards you, he is going the other way. If he runs from you he'll be where you are in no time. Up hill is down, and "over there" is "4 back here." One day we started from the office of the Boston Post to the Boston post-office, seventy feet distant. We walked straight ahead'-went- around seven blocks--saw a policeman standing in a door-way on each block-asked each one the route to the post-office. Saw the eighth policeman, asked him politely. Said he, "Look here, this is the eighth time you've asked me that question Move on, or up you go!" Thought the policemen must be brothers- they looked so much alike! Rather than go   B-o-s-t-o-n-!      69 around the block again we went t'other way, began to unwind, and got into the post-office by mistake. The front of a building is inside- in the courts.

Was mistaken. That kind of restoration wasn't policy I House rents are cheap in Boston. Moving is cheaper than house rent. It's all owing to the hub, the big organ, and the cradle. There is no drinking in Boston. No peculiar female characters. What is common is not pe- culiar. New Bedford is to be moved into Boston soon.

Thirty years since I slung those buttons into them box, with a sigh of great size.

So I used to run away, five miles through the woods, to see her who was so dear to me. And she used to fix up. I went six nights in the week. Every night Aurelia did wash her feet, and slip on her cowhide slippers. They looked red like, but 'twas all right, for pride is abom- inable. And being economical, Aurelia did not wear hose. Nature unadorned is adorned the most. And her hair! A very gentle mauve, without spot or blemish.  Pure as the life of John Brown, straight as the mountain ash! Her face was-well it was all face--and her breath was like new-blown hay. Ah, how I loved her; who could help it! There was no more Au- relias within sixteen miles, for honest men with little girls in their families had not discovered the beauties of our woodland place of residence  Aurelia's father liked the idea of wedlock   Hiow I lost AureUa.      75 concerning us. Aurelia had experienced twenty- two seasons of severe existence. Her father was a primitive artist, and played the march of civilization on the monarchs of the forest. He reaped the rich reward of twelve dollars a month and board for this pastime. My derivative was his employer.  Hence the position  Aurelia had' much appetite, and was expensive in this branch of education. Hence the desire. Dry- goods were expensive, and Aurelia's father being like his daughter, a little fat, had great difficulty in making both ends meet. Hence the ambition of the Tillinghasts. My father was more wealthier.   He could brandish a watch on the Sabbath, slung from a' genuine silk cord. And he had a satin vest, sev- enteen years old. And he had a pair of boots for Sabbath wear. And one griddle of the stove was always removed to furnish the wherewithal to polish those boots. I had to polish them. Hence my polish air and polished manner.  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7469-00000040"/> 76      Eow I lost Aurelia. Every Sunday, at two o'clock, the stage came into the settlement seven miles up the creek. There were two horses to that stage, and at least once a month it had a passenger. Once it had two passengers-a-man and dog. The man rode on the seat with the driver; the dog ran behind. That was a big day for Seely Creek. ]My father often spoke of it. He had been to the settlement every Sunday for four years. He was sick one day. 'Twas on that day the stage had two pas- sengers. Father said it was just his luck. The people there talked about the stage for a long time. It waited an hour till father could arrive, but lie didn't come. He was sick. He -heard of it, and felt bad, but all the neighbors told him of it. And Tillinghast always went to the settle- ment with him. They used to talk about my marriage with Aurelia. Tillinghast went to the settlement that Sunday, as usual, and he, a poorer man than my father, saw the stage come in  My fathier did not see the stage come in, and the   HRo- lost Aurc.       7 idea that Tillinghast did see it, created a coolness between them (even in July) they did not get over till January. My -father was a proud man-as he should have been, having such a son. So he told Til- linghast the match should be broken off. My father was a tall man, six feet four. Tillinghast was a little fat cuss, four feet six., They used to look up and down at each other. And that was the long and the short of it. The proposed wed- lock was delayed. Tillinghast made offers. He offered to settle lots of property on his daughter. He, too, was proud, andf eager for the fray-so to speak. I was tall, like my masculine derivative. Aurelia, like a dutiful girl, patterned after her papa. Filial affection is commendable, so I commendabled Aurelia. And everybody wants to marry in a high family.  - But the stage affair damed the stream of neighborly affection existing between our pater- nals. Tillinghast was to blame-he said so. He  &#xD;<pb n="78 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7469-00000041"/> 78,     How I lost Aureha. offered to give Aurelia, on her wedding, a skillet without a handle; a half-dozen new sap troughs; a pair of red stockings, which should come to within an inch of her dress; a new splint broom; a. wooden, pancake turner, made out of water- beech, so that its natural limber would flap the cakes nicely; a top-knot hen; a wooden scoop- shovel, in which to take up dirt from  the kitchen; a pair of his old pants to begin a rag carpet with, and a new fine-comb, left there by a pedler the year before in payment for supper, lodging, and breakfast for himself, horse, and wagon!

We slipped into the spring, and hug. ged each other then; that was the first Aurelia ever knew of a waterfall; but it didn't make her proud. *  *  *  *   At last a new stage- route was put on. It led by Aurelia's house. Her father's house did not have many mansions, but it was enlarged and made a stage house. And - the stage stopped there over night. And that accomplished stage-driver was a mean cussl I thought it then; I think it now. He was not handsome, like myself; but lordy, how he could crack a whip! Early in the morning he would get on a stump by the barn and snap that long whip till the hens and roosters would cackle for two hours! Aurelia's parents thought 'twas I kissin' Aurelia, but 'twan't! And all this a heavy novelty was to that sweet little one. She had never experienced so much happiness previous. It was a new thing.

And the whipper-snapper of a stage driver brought her candy all the way from Elmira, then called by the name of lew- town. And he did keep his hair greased! And essence of cinnamon brought he for those mauve-complexioned tresses, and essence of peppermint for her breath. He was an extrav-- agant stagist And it was by thus the serpent of that gay fellow's love stole into my temple, I thought him all-fired humbly. I often in- formed Aurelia to this end, but she could not discern it. He used to kiss her, and hug her, and I knew it. And she liked iti But what could I do?  Aurelia was the first born! I bought a whip, and had a big snapper put on it, and nearly cut my ears off in the endeavor to crack it as fiercely as did Jehiel, for that was his name.   But 'twas no use; the business was new, the snapper wouldn't snap, and Jehiel beat me!   How I lost Aurelia.     81 The night we sat on the edge of the spring and hugged ourselves into it, I wanted to be liberal. I had nothing, so I gave Aurelia a button from my trowserloons. I had no knife to cut it off, so Aurelia chawed it off. And I took some of her hair, made a little string from it, and hung it around her neck. It was a charm with Aurelia's charms.  She wore it near her heart. I was happy when she wore it, and often wished I was a little button with a tin top and wooden bottom, so I could hang around Aurelia's neck. When the stage stopped at Tillinghast's he spruced up. He had my father then where the hair was short, and their affection took another cold. My father took a rheumatism  in his limbs, and couldn't walk to the settlement, as he once- could, to see the stage come in. So he went to walk down to the corner where Aurelia lived, to see it come in.

And he used to ad  mire Jehiel, who was the greatest whip-snappel in that county. He took pride in it. I grew to hate my father because he spoke well of Jehiel. Not of him, but of his whip-snapping. I felt bad and out in the hemlock pined to a shadow. *  *  *  One day father come home. He handed me something tied up in a little piece of dirty cloth. I opened it. It was the button now before me. A simple button, but it did a tale unfold which rang in my ears worse than ever did Jehiel's whip!

And such eyebrowsl When he was but a child, so-called, some monster must have slung him head-first against a stone wall! His jaws were pretty jaws. They were so severe in their angles. There was so much jaw in pro- portion to the purp, that we wanted to call him Swisshelm; but he wan't that kind of a pet  But he was nigh onto all jaw  We kept him four weeks in the sanctum, and all that time hired a nigger to watch him.

And he was the. hungriest dog we ever sawl A pennyworth of beef didn't last -him as long as a ten-dollar bill would a Democrat the night before election. He had a fine voice for beef. And what the dog would not eat, the nigger would! And the dog grew large, and ponderous about the jaws. He used to eat paper, books, mats, vests, old hats, gloves, patent-leather boots, window curtains, and sich. He ate such stuff for dessert. That dog ate a full calf-bound set of Harper's Weekly one day, just on account of the calf. And he ate ten copies of the Chicago TBi- bne one day, but the lie in them papers made him so dog-goned sick all that week that he would have died if the nigger in 'em  hadn't emeticked 'em out, and so he got well! But he never pined himself to a shadow hankering after Republican newspapers any more. And he kept on stealing. We always thought them Republi.   The Dog-ondest Dog.     87 can newspapers aided the development of that complaint, for he was sure to steal all the nigger earned- for us. He'd walk out on a rainy day for his health, and always came back with something he'd found. Once it was a lady's veil. Then it was half a ham, with a butcher-knife sticking in it. What he wanted to- bring the knife with him for is more than we know, unless he had to cut and run! I One day he came in with a baby's cradle. There was some blood on the edge of it, and all that afternoon the bell-man was out ringing a bell and yelling, "Boy lost Il"John Brown didn't go out for two or three days 1 Once he came in with a wooden leg in his teeth. That night a wooden-legged soldier was missing-; but as crippled soldiers were of no ac- count, he didn't try to keep shy a bit.

One day he came in with a contribution box he'd stolen from the entry-way of a close col- munion church. He carried the lox behind the end of the sideboard, broke it open-and looked icek/ John Brown never stole a contribution box again; and after that, when we'd point to that box, and smile, he'd drop his tail--what there was of it-and look mean enough. And he'd steal halters, bridles, saddles, and such stuff. And as he grew older, he'd actually unhiteh a horse and lead him across the line into Minne- sota.  When any one would call out, "'John Brown," he'd go for a horse, sure. 'And so we had to change his name. What to call the cuss we didn't know. But as he had chawed up so many books, and was always meddling with what was none of his business, and grew to be sort of dogmatic, and radical about his bloody jaws, we left off calling   Th, Dog-ondes Dog.      8t9 him John Brown, and called him Sumner.

That bothered him. He had a tough time of it. Gra- cious, how he'd twist his jaws and barkl And he loved to get into a dog fight, too. He'd whip any dog in the city. But it took so long to get him in a fight, that he was useless. You see when we wanted him to fight one dog, we'd set him to fight another one, and then he'd back into the t'other one, then fight his way outl I But it took so long to learn his style; and then 'twan't always convenient to get up two fights, so we changed his name again. He grew beautiful each day. In fact, he was a handsome cuss! And folks took so mnuch notice of- him he forgot he was nothing but a poor dog, and he acted so that we thought best to call him Butler.

And how that dog would strut And he grew mean.  He'd drive small dogs away from their bones, and got to chasing kittens to some-point out of harm's way. And he'd snap and snarl at women-always insulting them. And he had half-a-dozen pups he'd picked up around the city, as mean but not as smart as he; and these pups would chase poor girls into some corner where he would scowl, bark at, and then, after rubbing his dirty nose over them, leave them with some wound on them.

The only thing he was fit for was to watch jew- elry stores! Let that dog go by a show-window where there would be some silver-ware, and he'd stand around there all day. And he'd look into store windows, and break into churches to look at the communion plate.  And he'd follow a funeral for miles, if there was a silver plate on the coffin.  Most folks thought he was always one of the mourners. But when we found that the graves were dug into, and one day saw his kennel filled with silver plates, screws, etc., gnawed from coffin-lids, we knew what a vehe- ment mourner Butler was.

A FEW years since the country remem- bers that a steamer, the Lady Elgwn, was lost on the trip from Chicago to Milwaukee, and about three hundred persons on board were drowned. The first report was that all had perished; but several escaped and re- turned to their homes, after an absence of from one to three days. There lived at Milwaukee, at that time, a burly German, named Triheister Dotswinger, who rejoiced in a three-cornered lager-beer saloon, an eight-square vrouw, and lan oval-faced  cherub of eighteen summers, boy   Teutonw Anguzih.      105 by nature, Schneider Dotswinger by name, and graceful as a young bologna-sausage in all its pristine bloom. Schneider coaxed his two. derivatives to go on the ill-fated steamer. News came that she was lost. The anguish-stricken Teuton, in a parox- ysm of grief, called on us in the editorial rooms, to inquire about his boy. We told him-as we were informed-that all were lost, and of course his boy was a goner. He seated himself on a pile of books, and thus held forth: "Mein Gott! mein Gott! Mr. Bumroy!

He had a red house, a red horse, a red barn, red fence, a red cow, red window sash, an old-fashioned red sleigh, a red smoke-house, red hogs, little red eyes, and a red nose-the very picture of a New England Puritan. He had a wife who wore a red petticoat, and had the readiest' tongue a woman ever fired at us. He had some little ready money, got by making cider brandy from stolen apples, and taking toll from the copper-spattered contribution saucer he  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7469-00000058"/> "O  '"Bride" "and the Deaoen's Sela. passed in the red church in that settlement of Sunday beans, week-day onions, and orthodox views. And he had a female child, whose name was Hexa Brightwater, and who was twenty-nine years old; wore red stockings, red garters, metal- tipped shoes, green spectacles, and the prettiest red hair the world ever set eyes on or into. Hexa, a true New England gal, chewed wads of pine gum, and sweetened her breath with onions. Hexa wasn't so much handsomer than a doll as to make the doll faint; but she was intelligent. In fact, intelligence was her best hold, but one; she was great on making baby garment and had two trunks full packed away, that she might be ready as willing when the evil hour drew nigh, as she trusted it would, from year to year. My father was,a common sort of a rooster, and lived outside of the drippings of New England blessings. He was taught that in no other place could there be found women of intelligence, and   "Brick" and the DeCeons Htem.  1" he sent me there to find a loving lass, to court some intelligent beauty, to woo some refined nutmeggress, and with her return to my rural home to astonish the barbarians with something beyond the average of female loveliness. I went to the Land of Steady Habits.  I wanted to hand several "Bricks" down to pos- terity, and was told by father that with a New England girl for a wife I could raise more children, grow more onions, skin more eels, sing more psalms, know more of what was going on in the neighborhood, hear more scandal, sleep less nights, have more relatives, eat more beans, love myself and hate others more, and get more out of a dollar, than with any other sort of a woman in this happy country, so-called. Deacon Brightwater, with his bright red nose, was a cunning man. He -was a New England Christian. He crowded nineteen eggs under a fourteen-egg hen, always borrowing the five odd eggs t He smelt of peoples' breath to see if they  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7469-00000059"/> "2  "Brick " and the Deacon's Hexa. had been drinking liquor, and then made a few stamps, as a Connecticut Good Templar spy, by informing against them. He didn't drink him- self, but got his nose tinted by holding it so close to the mouths of those who did I He split matches to make them last longer. He'd pick up hen's heads to boil them for the fat thereon. He'd take a claw-hammer, when he went visiting, to draw tacks from carpets when unseen. He made cider-brandy, and made it on shares. He was always trying to swap horses, but never could find one that worked well on his machine; so he tried each one until noon, and sent them home hungrJ !  He was a careful, prudent, whole-souled, liberal, spontaneous edition of be- nevolence, who gave his hogs' tails and rams' horns to the poor, and made prayers longer than the sweep of his cider mill, but,-like that instru- ment, always pointed down. Hexa Brightwater never had a beau till I visited her. She was too intelligent for the   "Brick " and the lDeacon's Hxa. t113 common herd.  She knew  everything. She could tell how long a wad of gum would last, how much a Southerner made from a nigger, how many duck eggs would hatch under a two- year-old pullet, and when beans were fit to bake. She was one of those higher sphere beings, who could do no wrong; who could not endure those who did. How I did spark Hexa! Deacon Brightwater heard that I had wealth, and he was willing. He'd go to bed early. He'd play snore so Hexa and I would hurry up. Mrs. Deacon Bright- water went to sleep, too. She crawled in beside the deacon-front side. Their bedroom door was always shut by particular request of Hexa. She knew why it should be closed. I used to hear a footfall on the bedroom floor.  I mis- trusted Hexa's mother used to watch at the key-hole. She could see where Hexa and I sat to squeeze each other's hands, eat candy, and taste of each other's lips. I didn't like to  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7469-00000060"/> "4   "Brick" amd the Deasonls JYei. have her do this.  So one night, when I mis trusted, I slipped up beside the door and jabbed a wire into the key-hole. It was a long wire. I heard somebody squeal inside. She died be- fore morning from  the effects of that playful, Puritanical jab!  That wire cured the key-hole disease. It opened the old lady's eye! The deacon followed  her to the grave. With true NTew England affection he put up a tombstone, on which was- Hie jacket Hexa's Mother, Orphan child without a' brother. She went hence with a single eye, &amp;c., And left I single to go forth  Tears cannot restore her, Therefore I weep I As I pile sod o'er her All in a heap. The deacon grow  pale, all except his nose. That wouldn't pale. It was in better spirits. The  deacon married a  nigger lady from  the   "Briek " and the -Deacon' Hexa. 115 cotton country, and was happier than ever. Then Hexa and I had it all our way. We'd sit in the parlor, I cross-legged, Hexa with one foot under her, like a duck. She was strong minded. She wanted heaps of hugging, and you bet I was old industry at that business. She used to begin our Sunday night devotion by singing-- "Arm me with jealous care l" I used to arm her, every time! She liked it. Then she would read a chapter about how the- waste places should be made glad. I used to make her waist places glad, lots, till my arms got so tired I couldn't. Then she'd pillow her heacon my manly chest, and I'd pillow my head on her manly chest. And we agreed that all I had should be hern, and all she had should be mine. She thought mine was more than hern, but it wan't. Her dad was rich. I used to help her weed onions. That was hei  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7469-00000061"/> "6  "Brick" and the Deacon's Hema. strong game. She'd snatch an onion bed bald- headed in four minutes. She never missed a weed. She knew clover from onions just as easy. When they all grew in one clump, she'd dissect them quicker than a cat could lick her ear. I've seen her snatch for a handful of weeds right in among the onions, and never faze an un The old deacon said once, as I stood in the barn hold- ing a sheep for him to shear, that there was a consolation in affliction, for he had buried six wives and felt that each one was a stepping-stone over the river to glory. He paused his shearing, looked skyward up alongside a black bottle he carried in a side pocket, and resumed his clip- ping.  I saw by his nose that he was affected. I pitied him. I asked him if the riveriwas broad. He said it was, and deep. I asked him if his stepping-stones reached, as yet, near the glory shore. He said not quite--about half way. I looked at the humpy old deacon and his bald head, and as I got sight of his new wife, asleep   'Brick" and the Deacons Hexa.  117 in the sun on the wood-pile, surrounded by a swarm of admiring flies, anxious to kiss her for her mother, but too polite to touch her opened lips, I reverently thought, "Old Cocky, it will be a wonder if the nigger don't beat you and plant you first as the next step-stone." We sheared the sheep. Then we sat under the fefce, and while I tied my shoe I could hear a gurgle about the deacon's mouth. I thought it was his nose preparing to blossom, but it was only cider-brandy. And we sat -there and talked until the noon- hour came. We settled our marriage matters, and I was to have Hexa, if I could get her. There was a question about the dowry.  The deacon wanted me to pay the funeral expenses of his last wife; not -but he was glad to get rid of her, but he found her more expensive after death than before. I refused to pay for such nonsense.  He found that I was in earnest, and let up.

Hexa, in the way of time and travel, I'd have gone for his red knob, and he knew it. By and by the old deacon fell asleep, and I went in to comfort Hexa. We had a nice time. She was a rapid talker. I was a mere man of mud in comparison to her. She knew she was smart. She knew all other women were igno- rant, for she had been taught it. I didn't love her for her love, but for her hate. She hated everything beyond her eyeshot.  She hated some parts of New England, not because onions wouldn't grow there, but because in some places there were great, ugly Democrats, and they kept increasing. But I didn't want a woman to love me-only one who was intelligent-and so I sparked her. Our marriage-day was fixed. ;Being an igno- rant Western laborer, I was forced to agree to remain a servant in that household ten years, to get the hang of their notions. I had to learn to use a sickle instead of a reap-   "Beick "ai' the Deacon' s Hexa. 119 ing machine-to use psalms instead of melodies -to work for others instead of myself. It was all right, for a while. But I couldn't love the deacon's dusky wife. Did not like her color. And when I wanted to hunt, I had to shoot straight up into the air, or down into the well, for fear of trespassing.. And when I wanted to run and expand my lungs, I was plum against a stone fence in less than a minute. If I kissed Hexa on the Sabbath, I was fined for it. I was forced to drink cider-brandy, or nothing; and I was fed on onions till I sickened of them. Onions are good for two or three hundred meals, but for a steady diet, I like them not. I tried to love Hexa; but as soon as she found I was betrothed to her, she put on airs. She made me hew her wood, draw her water, find her in food, and pay extra for sewing on my shirt but- tons, making neckties, and all such little jobs. And I had to work hard all day carting apples from other farms for Deacon Bright.  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7469-00000063"/> 120  "Brick/" arnd the Deacone's Ba. water to grind up into apple cider to redden his nose. And if I wanted a drink of cider I had to pay for it from over-work. And I had to work to fix up the little garden patch--to repair his old mill that wasn't worth repairs. As the old deacon grows old he grows mean. As Hexa thinks she has got a fellow tight, she just everlastingly goes for him. I am the best worker ever on the place. I make the old farm, so-called, valuable, and it is for Hexa's interest to keep me. But she hates me-she is jealous of me---she don't try to make it pleasant for me-she quarrels with me, and says I am nothing but a great ugly brute. She scolds me till I could almost die, steals my trinkets, cuts up my clothes for rag carpets; and whenever she goes to a tea-party, she tells folks what a mean cuss .I am and what a sweet intelligent angel she is. Some day I'll quit on Hexa-we'll go through that old cider-brandy mill, and leave for the   ^"Bzk " and the Deacon' sem.  121 West, where I can see daylight without being obliged to look' straight up, and where I can find some one better natured, if not so smart to sew on buttons and make neckties.

I came near going for to quit. I went so far down the lane, it was a grave question whether it were best to retrace or trace ahead. I caught it ever so easy. The fire went out. The lamp flickered low. The kitchen clock tolled the death of the day as I told the girl I loved her. The clock struck as the idea struck me I was getting cold. I told the girl so. We sat on a sofa. Said she, "Sit up closer." In her lap we laid our }Lead. Who cared for a- little cold? We talked oJ lots   Cwe Jor a Gold.      123 Wee talked low, because we were down-stairs. I caught the cold, but not lthe girl. Then I went to a doctor--a doctor of physic-so I met-a- physic! How do you like that joke? He felt of my tongue and looked at my pulse; said I was sick. Told me to go home, soak my feet, cover up in bed, eat nothing for a week, and be well, Gave him five dollars and saw my landlord.

Protected, authorized, and commanded by this document, set out, armed with witch hazel-rods, a large gimlet, a string of auger holes to drive down, pair of opera glasses, the amnesty oath with sugar in it, pair of brogans reaching to the knees, four reams of foolscap, a trunk full of greenbacks, cigar box full of clothes, and much rectitude in those heart of mine concerning the Petrolia Bory Alis, for which I was to make light for this wicked world. Arrived on the spot which General Dix once proposed to shoot a man on, I pitched my tent, took the oath diluted with hot water and sugar, became intent on the bore, and proceeded with my procedure. First went through the rod, nature's greenbacks when the moon is right.            .. i At fifty feet, struck a strata of Egyptian marble, in which dead Ethiopian frogs, mer- 6*  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7469-00000069"/> 130  Sends the President his Ann-Alice. maids, and such works of art were imbedded and petrified with astonishment. At seventy feet, passed through a deserted Indian village. At ninety feet, struck a balloon which had Chinese hieroglyphics on the bottom, bound up. At ninety-six feet, bored through a country school-house, where a girl of nineteen sat in a petrified state, oiling her hair with petroleum. At one hundred and ten feet, passed two dogs imbedded in solid rock, guarding a baby, which evidently had been rocked to sleep, as it was exceedingly much dead!  Twenty feet further down, an obstacle so hard presented itself that I could not drive the auger hole, so was obliged to resort to a yard of drilling. Brought up a little wool, some thick pieces of skull, from which I was led to the belief that I had struck the head of a sable son of Ham. If so, I beg the pardon of the defunct'Hammer. At the depth of two hundred feet I struck a cooper shop, and from this judged oil was not far   Sends the President iis Ann-Aice. 131 below, so advanced with caution. Ten feet further down I ran into a gin-mill, and felt in better spirits. At the depth of two hundred and fifty feet, struck a bottle of old rye. I knew civ- ilization was not far distant, and waited. Soon a reliable contraband came along, and said I was oil right, and by urging my auger holes thirty feet farther into the stomach of the earth, I should be rewarded. I never can forget the debt of gratitude to this poor, down-trodden brother, who so kindly was unto me, and who I love so very much! Reliable contraband! I caressed him sweetly for the feminine half of his immediate ancestry, and drove on with my bore! I passed several valuable sections of farming land, rivalling the prairies of Illinois; a few stratas of property resembling Connecticut stone fence; some loyal streaks, which proved to be coal;  several gold  and silver lodes; sand- stone and slate enough to furnish all of Brigham Young's children; salt water, in tiers,  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7469-00000070"/> 132  Sends the President his Ann-Alice. and a variety of photographic views of eminent roosters belonging to this or to some other world. At the depth of two hundred and eighty feet, I struck a rich vein of patriotism. I looked for the model military man, Butler, as I went down; but met some victims coming up, who said he was down so low that no mortal could reach him, no matter how fast he drove his bore. Six feet further down I struck a box of Continental currency, on which green mildew was rapidly gathering; and several. settlements of freed negroes, relieved from bondages since the war began. At the depth of three hundred and seven feet nine inches and a fraction over a fifteenth, I struck Pete very much in the crude state, and now glory in a well which spurts seven hundred barrels of crude, and nine hundred barrels of refined petroleum, every six minutes.

From developments being made, I expect to be able in a week to report that: add to the comfort of boarding-houses, carpet church aisles, soften sleeping-car berths, keep tobacco- chewers frorm soiling carpets, restore peace, lessen the price of gold, bolster up damaged reputa- tions, marry old maids, find. homes. for war widows, make conductors honest, keep women from  gossip, curl straight hair, and give free passes on all railroads.

And we rode horse for her paternal derivative to cultivate corn; and we milked the brindle heifer as what no other boy could milk; and we split oven-wood-and who would not?-for her mna. And at night, when    bats came forth, and tumble-bugs crawled over the lea, and young pullets sat in maiden meditation fancy free, holding their head under one wing so as to learn love by hearing their hearts beat, we would hasten under Talista's window, and she would, with her lily-white hand, snail us up by the hair till we arrived at the bower of love, as she called 'her garret.

When the week had busted on the rock of Saturday night, we used to wander by the brook- let and let the brook wander, too. And Kalista went forth with us. Hand in hand, like the Siamese twinsters, we roamed, and sat on the dewy bank to catch colds in our heads, and lux- uriate on the "bank wet with dew!"And we used to recline against a fatherly or motherly elm tree, and squeeze our each other's hands as we rolled our eyes and peeked upward into the blue vault our spirits longed to vault into, but didn't.

Did you ever spark - If not, advance your works upon a female crinoline-dear, and commence active hos- tilities to oncet. Once we sparked Nalista when her mother was looking.

You jest can gamble we took tea from that little table lots of times, and never asked any one to help put back the plates! Kalista was a zephyr on the kiss. It was pretty near her best holt. Making much was Kalista's charm. When the water would boil, how she did sprinkle meal into the iron-iron-recepteakettle, and shake her locks in glee to see the infant mush bubble and splutter like a fellow kissing a baby with his mouth full of beechnuts. We courted, sparked, and courted Kalista seventeen long years. She grew from sighs to greater size, and all went merrily as a funeral bell. Kalista's maternal author said we might, and we intended to. We sat on rail fences, end boards to wagon-boxes, piles of pumpkins,- heaps of potatoes, door-steps, saw-logs, plough.  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7469-00000075"/> ":2     Brik " ad Kalita. beams, pine-stumps, where we told our love, and, in anticipation, combed our hair, peeled our potatoes, chopped our hash, rocked our- well, never mind-wore our old clothes, except when we had company, and waxed fat on love and- sich. Kalista's father said we might, and there again we had things bagged. We counted our calves, and weighed our pork, and sold our veal, and churned our little mess of butter, and took cur wool to market, and put up our little preserves, and revelled in that future which is so much like an oyster-more shell than meat. One day a baulky steer slung one of his back hoofs in among the old gent's waisthand, and after a series of severe discomfoit, the: -old rooster went hence in February, when we; all followed with a march! Kalista was a sensi- tive plant, measuring fifty-nine inches' around afflictions, and so we. murdered the steer, and made him into smoked beef. And at supper.

Then Kalista's mother, who would not par- take of the beef, took cold in her head, and went hence. It was autumn-one of the fall months. The mother of our heart's poison-as we family-arly called Kalista-was of an inquir- ing disposition. She always asked numerous things. She asked the egg man if chickens abided in the shells of the hen-fruit she bought. She wanted to know why rounds were put in ladders crosswise instead of up and down. She wanted to know why pants were made so that a man could not take them off over his head. She said, in her innocence, that an- eclipse was caused by a nigger convention between-her and the moon! But why the moon fulled rather busted the venerable mother of our Kalista, and she sought to study it out. She read Da  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7469-00000076"/> "4    ^ Brick " and KaUsta. boll's Arithmetic, Sands' Spelling-book, Robinson Crusoe, and the La Crosse DEMOOCAT; but she could not get her fork into the reason. The old lady read in an almanac that on a certain night the moon would full. We went to see Kalista that night, to see if our love would full. The old lady determined to watch it and see how a moon fulled, and when it fulled, and what for did it full. Night came, and she wrap- ped one leg of a pair of red flannel drawers about her head, and when all in the house was still, she emerged into the sitting-room, and in her antique costume. The old lady says: "Brick, your supper is ready!" So we went into the parlor, and kissed the hours away. Very fine supper! The old lady took an almanac, a New York- Directory, and a tallow candle out on the back stoop. She anchored in a big chair, and waited to see the moon change its clothes. She looked, and looked, and at last fell asleep for a moment,   "B rik" and iKalista.    145 when, as she said, the darned thing up and fulled, and she didn't see it! She was not an observing female, but she never lost any children. Yet, for all that, the moon worried her-her candle went out. Ka- lista was left to be her own mother, or do with- out. Kalista took grief very healthy. She wore mourning, and looked well, as she wept because the jeweller did not get her mourning-pin done in time. She ironed a new cotton handkerchief on the coffin lid, so as to have some use of the furniture ere it was knocked down, and was ready to wedlock then. Kalista was lonesome when her authors were gone, and we should have wedded but for the looks of the thing. Then there came from the war a journeyman converter, and he offered Ralista all he had, at once. And Kalista, being a lonesome girl, said she would, and she did. And her and the good man went to the carpenter's and ordered a graveyard fence for the loved relatives, and the 7r  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7469-00000077"/> "6     jBrkickc and Kaista worker of wood threw in a cradle, and the pair wedded at once, and now talista is telling some other delegate that " supper is ready!"

Went forth. Walked slowly around two corners for. fear one wouldn't be enough. Took passage with Oscar. Advanced with Oscar to the Car- nival. Marched-with vigor to the gate. All right. Then skirmished to left in the direc- tion of Carnival - Verily, verily, big thing. Two bands played music while many girls went forth to skate. Delicate business, that skating! Gazed with admiration on the evolu- ting crowd: who were toying on the bosom of skating pond. M. and Mrs. Avenue were there in carriages.  The Avenue girls were there. Nice girls. One sweet little dumpling said: "Please give me a hand till I get on the ice?"I gave both hands, and when we reached the glassiness thereof, and she told me she was "on it," how my heart jumped as her heart smiled so sweetly into mine own. J. M. didn't trouble me even in thought, then I Just as I helped my angel with pink skirt 8  &#xD;<pb n="170 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7469-00000089"/> 170   Brick "Skateth at Central Park. and striped hose on the ice, she scooted from me like a bird on wing, so to speak. I gazed and she went. Then I fell back to the recep- tion-room. One of the Avenue girls, with another one, came in with fun in their eyes, paint on their cheeks, curls on their hair, fancy skating-rings on their bodices, and skates in bags on their arms. I offered to put skates on for them; offer was accepted.  Goodness I did you ever hold the foot of an Avenue girl in your lap and gently squeeze the little toes of the little foot in the flurry of getting the skate to fit? Oh I dear, it's fun! And such short skirts, and such pretty Bal- moral hose, like little barber-poles of flesh, blood, lightning, and electricity! Helped many skates on  to many feet of the Avenue girls. Large family of girls; one of them gave I half a dollar for skating her.

Skating is not, in the present year of our Lord, my best forte. But strong heart- said "Go it!" Obeyed injunction, and went it.  Gracious, but how easy! Just like falling off a log-only a little heavier on the fall. Fine exercise. Many boys and girls mirthed audibly to see me glide rap- idly up the pond; and, in trying to dodge two hundred and fifty pounds of skates, in short hoops and red boots, inserted one leg in an air hole. Very moist was that are hole. Got out with agility, and help of a shinny club, and went on. Just as I started, a sweet little chicken, in blue jacket, striped apron, streaked hose, and velvet cap, darted past, and said, " Catch me." Then I urged my mad career on to a close or toward the animate clothes which was so swiftly on the glide. She dodged, and I dodged.  Met a long rooster with eye-glasses, side-whiskers, bob- tail coat, fancy skates, limber legs, and a lisp. He yelled, "Take care, fellah!" And we both  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7469-00000091"/> 172  "Brick " &amp;Sateth at Central Park. dodged the same way. I slanted the right skate a point to windward; bobtail anchored. "All right," said I, and passed on.  Lost the blue jacket and striped apron in the melee. Met timber legs on a limp. He wanted an apology; so did I. We parted in coldness, and. he with a contusion on his head. The music kept playing itself. The crowd kept arriving. Never saw so much style on ice. Blue jackets, red jackets, yellow tunics, green skirts, purple Balmorals, striped hose, red gaiters, pretty ankles, jaunty skating-hats, neat little limbs-O Lordyl but how queer a fellow feels when he feels queerly! And we all skated. Pretty soon, a frolicksome oyster came tearing up the pond, steadying his gray-haired governor. How they glided I And  the writer hereafter in their wake.

More than twenty girls fell over us. At last I emerged-yes, that is the word-from being where I had not ought to have been. I crawled out from that place of confinement with nose like a potato-blossom, half a hoop-skirt over my head and around my neck. And what work I had getting out; worse than boring for petroleum- as I wriggled through a forest of red stockings, variegated circus-tents, skates, and fancy elastics. Go to where I have been, go see what I have seen, go feel what I have felt, on that Fifth Avenue Skating Pond.

I told her a Newfoundland dog fell from the ferry-boat, and I became injured in trying to save the life of those dog. J. M. don't love dogs, and says I am a fool.

She was a school teacher, who drew seven dollars a month for spanking the rule of three into the vulgar fractions confided to her charge, and for adding accomplishments as 'twere to the -result of others' multiplication!

She was of the New England type.   She was lo2pre-itanical. Thus worshipped I her, the most beautifulest ant in the sugar bowl. And she made both ends meet by skin- ning eels. She was a most exalted and tri- umphant eel skinnist. The Massachusetts girls teach schools and skin eels for the market. Said I, "Betsey, if it's not a-skin too much, let me go out with thee and aid in thy toils, and see thee divest eel of cuticle. She said, yea. I went. She had a hooked nose. She had three hoops-at regular intervals.  She was Massachusetts schoolmarm. She- was old maid. She understood all of Daboll but the multiplication. She had never been on the multiply! Oh, no!

I would crawl out of myself as those eel crawls out of his undershirt in thy hands, and be thine onlyest."' She took up another eel. "Oh!

She said, no, and looked sidewise. /    "Brick's" Betsey.     179 She took another eel. I then caressted her. Said she, "Praise the Lord, but that is the first kiss ever mortal man gave me." - I asked her if. she liked it? She said it war better nor spanking, a *oung un, or skinnin a big eel. She said she liked, school- teaching. It was better than a gymnasium. She said kissing was better than skinning eels. When a Massachusetts girl says that, you may,. with theb lambs on the hills, gamble that she liketh it with vehement muchness.

She skinned eels, chawed spruce gum, and talked love. Said she- "What is your name I " Asked we, "The reverberating cognomen to which we respond " Said she, "Yes." Said we, "' Brick ' Pomeroy." Then she asked us of our W. estern home. She wanted to know what State llinois was in, and if Wisconsin was in the First or Second Ward of La Crosse. And she wanted to know if we had young ones in the West. We told her not many, yet! Then she wanted to know- if the Mississippi river had eels in it. We told her, nay. And she wanted to know if the people out in that barbarous region wore clothes every day, or only when they went sparking. And she wanted to know how far it was from where we lived to a house. And she wanted to know if they spanked or ferruled youngsters in schools,   -"Brick's"Betsey.    181 and if we had schools. And she wanted to know if women dressed in bearskins or tilting hoops, which we suppose are all the samel And she wanted to know if we had newspapers, and could read and write, and had ever heard of Anna Dickinson. And she wanted to know if it was not terrible living so far from Boston! Then I caressted her and kissed her so sweetly. And she twined the eel skins in a garland and wreathed them about our neck as she sat there in maiden meditation fancy free, like' a box of No. 11 boots. Then we -said-- "Oh I Betsey Jerusha, thou hast spokenest with wisdom. I will converse with thee, elastic nymph. I am a barbarian. We are all bar-. barians in the West.

I should say N ew York differed from the oil regions, yet it is real fun to skirmish about here, looking for the main chance, and prospecting for indications of the great fluid. When I made up my mind to visit the oil regions, a little note was sent to my Ann Jane, telling her that soon after dark began to dawn on all things here below, she would hear the door-bell. The door-bell meant me. Ann Jane received the letter, and got herself up in style. There may be sweeter girls than her, but she will do. Oh, yes, she will, and I know it. Re- gardless of taste or expense was my toilet made. Like a night-blooming cereus looked I. Active as an ant on a hot griddle I advanced up the steps to her brown-stone front, rang the bell, and went in. We met the usual way-so the report said. Talk about new mown hay, sweet cream, a love of a bonnet, or a new baby, that dear Ann Jane is so much sweeter than all them, it is a wonder they existeth.  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7469-00000100"/> 190    How to Bwuy Oil Laegs.

We turned the gas down low for economy. I had on pat- ent leather boots, with red tops and yellow silk straps, rather elegant pants, and a large bunch of other clothes, with at greatness of candy in pockets. We talked-Ann Jane is a good con- versationer. I told her that oil was what oiled me. In childhood's balmy days aunty always gave me oil, with happiest effect, and I must have more. Ann Jane coincided. We ate up the candy, which seemed to grow weary of its perpetual sweetness, as the two lips of my stu- dent in economy rewarded me from time to time with the sweetest-never mind though, now.

At last, after the sun had concluded to retire, and after I had suffered on the top of that horse for seven hours, and ridden, if you call it riding, eleven miles as the chap said, back to Widow Gartan's barn, I rode up to a log mansion built out-doors against a big mud chimney. The horse stopped very easy; in fact, stopping was his best gait. I made friends with five dogs and rapped on the open door. "Come in," says a man. "Thany you," says I. "Yes, come in," said a woman. , "Ah! yes, thank you," said I. Get out," said the man.   How to BBuy Oil Lc s.    195 "Get out," said the woman.

He had grown clear through his hair, and was heavy on smoking native tobacco in a red clay pipe. There was more of his wife than of him, by a wheelbarrow full. He was slim. She did not slim a  bit.

And it was a good thing, for he never could have hugged his wife alone, had they not been long. Her arms were short. She did not need long arms to hug him. O Nature, how kind you are in such cases!

This morning the case came off, Ex-Mayor Hon. James I. Lyndes being the counsel for the prosecution, the defendant ap- pearing in his own behalf. The court-room was crowded, for the idea of trying an editor for stealing or shooting chickens was a novelty. The plaintiff brought in his bill, swore to its correctness, testified that he owned the chickens, that they were raised by a hen be- longing to him, that he saw the defendant shoot them, that he had repeatedly asked the defendant to settle for them, and failing to get pay or satisfaction, he was compelled to bring suit, and asked for judgment of one dollar, andosts. The defendant admitted shooting the chickens, and   proved by four reliable witnesses the fol- lowing facts: In April, 1866, the defendant owned a  fast- running trick mare, "Kitty," which animal was kept in a stable hired by him, and cared for by one of his employs.

In an old barrel in the stable, one of the hens, a black one, made her nest, laid thirteen eggs therein, and proceeded to raise a family. When- the hen got ready to set, the defendant instructed the boy who took care of his mare to go down town, purchase thirteen eggs of J. W. Robinson &amp; Co., grocers, and put them in the nest, first removing the other eggs. The boy did so, as was proved. He then personally drove the hen out of the stable a dozen times or more-he tried to make her leave-she would not, but proceeded to in- cubate his eggs, duly bought and paid for, without his consent, leave, or license, after re- peated efforts on his part and by his agents to have her vacate his premises. And, further, when the hen had hatched the eggs, she ran away with his chickens, eleven in number, two  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7469-00000109"/> 208      A.

Afterda patient hearing, the: judge decided that there was no   cause of action, and that the defendant was entitled to the other nine chickens, and the plaintiff must pay the costs of the suit, amounting to seventeen dollars and thirty-seven -and a half cents. - R   CHAPTER XXIII. As A PIc-NIO-IST. S a Pic-Nlic-ist I have reached  It was a calm, hot morning, about the half of July, 1867. The weather was all that could be desired with forty-seven degrees plus. I may say it was in a melting mood, with several meltings over.   And why not, when such is thus? Eulelia Jane said it was too hot to keep cool, and that we must go to a Pic-Nic for the benefit of the church. I asked Eulelia, if it was for the benefit of the church, why go forth when it was so d-readfully hot. Said Eulelia, "Don't  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7469-00000110"/> 210      As as Pio-.ic-. swear," and I sweared not any. Then she said it was to teach us that hot places should be shunned. And so we went. I am much fond of them-I mean Psic-Nics. Base-ball is good for exercise, but nothing com- pared to Pic-Nic. It is a good way to have cheap amusement-and much of it--at light expense. Eulelia is a sickly plant. She needs the fresh air. Being a stout cherub, I often go out with her to get a little air. After breakfast we started for the Pic-Nic- Eulelia Jane and I.

We were going to a Pic-Nic. I took along a few little things to use at the Pic-Nic. Merely a few little things that Eulelia Jane might want. There was not much, as all the men took a little something. All I had to take was Eulelia's poodle and a dog to guard it, a few eatables, and implements to be used -for the Pic-Nic; two hams, a case of crack- ers, ten loaves of bread, nine bottles, of catsup, sixteen boxes of sardines, seven custard pies, a jug of cold coffee, a box of lemons, ninety-three cucumbers, a quart of pepper-sauce, a box of raisins, nuts, and candy; some cold tongue, a block of ice, some few chunks of dried beef, a basket of champagne, an axe, two hatchets, crow- bar, spade, rope ladder, a Sunday-school library of books, fifty palm-leaf fans, a pew-cushion to keep Eulelia from taking cold, two hundred feet of rope for a swing, keg of spikes, water-pails,  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7469-00000111"/> 212-     As a Pic-ic-ist. and other articles of bigotry and "virtue," in- eluding a marble-top table, and fixings for an amateur base-ball game. Did I say Eulelia was lovely? Yessy, yessy! She was sweeter than any other woman, and there was more of her. She was an only child'! But she was much! It is good to have something to lean against. So she said we would go forth to Pic-Nic. So everybody went. That is why we had a good time. It is only four miles to the sylvan grotto where rural felicity had secreted himself. Rural felicity! Them is the feller! Eulelia went first, and I followed her with the things. I have been told that we wanted for nothing. But we did. I wanted a horse to aid me in toting things. It was a hot day, or there would have been no need   of Pic-Nic. We walked four miles, Eulelia ahead, and I carrying and drawing  the things.  Eulelia is playful. She :got off a pun at which all the   As a Pic-NVic-ist.     213 'others smiled severely. - She said I was good at drawing! I should say so. So would any one be who had my load. We went to the top of a high hill to get a breeze! Eulelia said it would be cooler there. That was what we sought, and- perspired because we found it not. It was a high hill. On the brink of a precipice. There was one tree there. The breeze, therefore, had a fair sweep. At ten o'clock we reached the summit. As an activi- test I bore good repute. Two miles distant, in the woods, at the foot of the hill, was a cool spring. .Being a nice, good-natured, active, little man, I was, sent for water. Eulelia said I could go just as well as not. She takes pride in my agility. I did not hear the suggestion. Eulelia lifted up her voice. I heard and went. No gentleman will contradict his wife I Them other fellers said they would fix things, and I might rest by going for water. I went down the hill at the peril and danger of my life  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7469-00000112"/> 214      A8 a PiC--Nicit. -what was left. And I had such a pleasant time getting back. Two- pails full of water- not a dry joke, else why this perspiration? I enjoyed this rise in the world, and thanked Eulelia for the same. When I returned with water they had fixed things. They were seated on the grass, under the tree. The claret was no more. The ice lay weeping in the sun.  Eulelia said it made it seem cooler I And she said if the ice melted I would go back for more. Sagacious sylph! Never contradict your wife! Pretty soon we had dinner. Eulelia said I could set lunch better than any other man. The other fellers said so. They sat in the shade, smashing flies, while I spread for lunch. The marble-top table came handy. I asked one of the gentlemen if he would open the sardines and cut the lemons. He was a -gentleman, and remarked- I'll see you in first 1"   As a Pie-Nie-ist.     215 He was a playfil duck. I opened the sardines --all but him!  The folks said I was a nice man, so kind and agreeable! We had a fine dinner. I had what was left. Then Eulelia proposed that we have a swing erected. Being a spry man, I had to climb a tree to adjust the ropes. It wan't the distance up, but it was the roughness-very hard on wearing apparel. At last I fixed the ropes. The swing was too low. It dragged on the ground. Being a man of muscle, and expert in the use of pickaxe, I had to grub a trench. Eulelia said I could do it quicker than any other man, and- no gentleman will contradict his wife I I picked and shoveled for three hours, and at last removed enough rocks to start the swing. We had a good time. It is fim to swing. Trenching is good. My trench was wide and deep, that the hoops might clear. Eulelia she tried it. .

She went through the air like a humming-bird-like a fairy. I began singing- - "See i oh, see my flower I " When there was a screech! The limb to which the rope was fastened failed to keep up. It lacked backbone! :It let down, and Eulelia was fast in the trench. Being very modest, she would allow no one but me to help her out! I worked two hours enlarging the trench, and at last rescued her. I wanted her to try it again, but she smiled sweetly, and said one plateful. was enough. Being active, I had to run down hill and back to the city for arnica liniment. Eulelia wanted it. I didn't ask her what for. It was none of my business. Husbands, obey your wives I Exercise is good. 'I had enough that day. I got this flower and that flower. I climbed   As a Pic-Nic-ist.     217 to the tops of trees like a red squnrel after something. I was let down the precipice by a rope to hunt for eagles' nests. I -was sent after water, ice, and such things, and seriously hurt my pants in the bird's-nest business. But we had a delightful time. Such a cool, pleasant time! Eulelia drank so much lem- onade she was sick.  So I drew her to the edge of the precipice in the little wagon I had dragged along, and let the breezes fan her brow. The others couldn't wait, and they went. Eulelia wanted to see the moon rise. She said it would be nice to look down and see it come up- So she sent me home with the thiings, and told me to hurry back for her as soon as I could, like a dear little man. Then she sat oh the edge of the rock, her feet pointing to the hunting-grounds beyond La Crosse. In one hand she held her parasol, and in the other her book, while her pretty poodle snoozed in her lap.  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7469-00000114"/> 218,     As a Pic-z-c-ist. Euleliaywas happy-I knew  it. The sun was sinking in the West. The gnats and mos- quitoes were tuning their lyres and biting Eulelia's nose, but she was bound to see the moon rise. Nothing like a novelty. As I gayly swore my way down the rocky steep, I saw a picture. It was Eulelia on a rock, singing- "I want to be an Angell " Such a day of sport!

Our ride- our immensely pleasant ride, has cost us over four hundred dollars already, besides the loss of a kiss, the young lady, and a few thousands after marriage! If we ever go out for such fun, some blind man will please shoot us. If that is sport, we pass! It's a humbug-a chimera-a delusion -   a-a-a horn-swogglement. We shall never engage in it again. If you want to sleigh-ride, go it, but excuse us. This freezing to death for the sake of sitting by the side of a pretty girl, is all a humbug, especially when Sunday -nights are as long as now. P.

Then we gave a barber ten cents for a dime's worth of facing. The next move was to eradi- cate the dust from our imported goods. This done, with trembling heart we started for the soci, We always were some on the ambition. Ac- tuated thus, we hadinvited the handsomest girl in La Crosse to go with us to help the heathen out of their religious panic.

She was the sweetest in the rosary--the gayest of the gay-the one altogether lovely. When we emerged outside from the sill of her father's dom icile, and saw Bluffer, our rival, riding by with a mad look, how our heart ambitionated as she placed her pretty hand within the graceful bend of our broadcloth! Guess not! We went to the sociable. Everybody was there. The house was crowd- ed. Didn't know the heathen had so many friends. Our Mirilda-that's her name-was the prettiest girl there. That made us feel good. We were late, and the chairs, sofas, settees, otto- mans, stools, etc., were occupied. Mirilda must have a seat, and to get it she had to sit on the wood-box. Didn't like  that. We  stood up. The sociable began.  A nasal chap read some- thing-couldn't tell what. Then commenced the chat with the ladies. Mirilda was the rose every one was after. Good for Mirilda, but we didn't   lobbesrmg Parties.     257 relish it. Every putty-head in the room was bound to monopolize her. We felt mad, and inwardly said, darn the heathen. Then we had games. There were forfeits to pay, and old Mother Wattles was the judge.  She did-not like us, because we did not marry her daughter. She knew we hankered after Mirilda, because we had told her in confidence, and, unable to hold so important an item alone, she had got the help of all the old gossips in the city. She was judge, as before stated, and every time a feller did any- thing she made him kiss Mirilda. DARN THE HEATHEN. Deacon Rattler did something, and he must make a " butter bowl " with our own sweet girl. And -he put his hands over his ugly face, and blindfold kissed her six several and distinct times; right in the mouth at that! The gray old nuisance! To see him kissing Mirilda made us feel as a lady feels to see a jackass stamping around in a bed of pinks.  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7469-00000135"/> 258     Slobbering Parties. Then a little runt with some goose-fuzz on his upper lip had to kiss her ten times. Then the school-master had to take a trial at it, with his essence-of-cinnamon-scented head! Then a doz- en dry-goods clerks, who Mirilda never would have let kiss her if it wasn't for fashion, had to help themselves to bliss from her ruby ware-' house! DAN' THE HEATHEN. After a while-a very long while, too, it came our turn, and we stood madus erectus in frontis the plethoric female judiciary! We knew she would tell us to kiss Mirilda, and we decided not to do it-just out of spite! But confound her if she didn't sentence us to go and get down on our knees before Miss Slimmer, an old maid of fifty-five, and then she was- to kneel too, and we were to kiss her twelve times by the thermom- eterI  We  did it! Miss Slimmer went at it like a dog after a rabbit, but then we do wish she'd let onions alone till after such exercises.   Slobbering Part e      259 They don't add to such things, even in her case! CONFOUND THE HEATHEN. At last the sociable was over! Our Mirilda had been kissed, slobbered, mussed, and mousled over by every chap in the room till she looked like a pan of currants, half green, half ripe I The plate was passed, and each donated. Not a donate from  us! We passed; too  We felt dreadfully womblecropt, and with Mirilda on our arm went home, disgusted with all such "kissing bees " for the sake of the heathen-con- found them! We didn't stay long at her house. We felt mad like! Mirilda felt sort of poorly, too, and said she didn't want to go again. Said she'd rather buy those groceries by the retail, as too many of them   spoiled the market! We kissed her good-night, and from her- lips we tasted cardamom seeds, tobacco, cloves, sardines, cassia  buds, lager-beer, camomile  flowers, Switzer cheese, gin cocktails, liquorice root, hard  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7469-00000136"/> 260     Slobb   Patis. cider, sweet flag, and the Lord only knows what else! All the effects of promiscuous kissing-foi the benefit of the heathen! Fashion sanctions it Darn fashion! That's all! -Who wants to take the girl he loves to such parties, where every mutton-head has license to kiss, slobber, and mousel over lips which at no other time could he dare to touch! It must be pleasant for girls to be chawed up and slobbered over by everybody in the room, It's so modest! It looks so angelic-like! When woman's lips become public property, we quit. How sweet is the kiss tinctured up like a drug store! It looks so retiring and lady-like to see a pair of ruby lips one has a love for, sitting out like a horse block! Fashion may tolerate it, but fashion is a fool-a very foolish fool at that I It will do to steal kisses by moonlight -when sleigh-riding-when standing by the gate to say good-night; or to delicately pluck those ripe enough to fall, as you sit on a sofa with the lamp   Slobering Parties.      261 turned down as if asleep, one arm .around the waist, the head carelessly resting on your shoul- . der, and the lips just opened as heaven opens to let in a loved spirit; but this promiscuous slobbering, with a hundred raw eyes watching and waiting for a like chance, is too much for the human.

Venerable -and far-sighted capillary producer  We do, and more too. Your Onguent is a big thing. Although in small cakes, it is neverthe- less a colossal item. We tried it. Following the printed directions given, we made a lather and applied the brush. The lather was mixed in a glass -dish, and in four minutes a beautiful hair, all shades of color, had started from the   Wonderful Ha'-Rqeroducer.     263 dish. We applied some to our face, and it took four swift-working barbers to cut down and mow away as fast as the beard grew. We put a little on the toe of each boot, and in an hour they looked like Zouave mustaches. We put some on a crowhar, and it is covered with long, curly hair like a buffalo, and in the coldest weather it can be used without mittens. A little on the carriage-pole started the hair on it like moss. We dropped some on the stove, and as the fire was kindled the hair started, and the hotter the stove became, the faster grew the hair, till the smell of the burnt hair became so powerful as to drive all from the room. The stove was set in the barn, and it can't be seen now, as the hair is literally stacked upon it. Only one applica- tion. A little applied on a wagon-tire has in five days started a vigorous crop, and now the wagon can be driven over a plank-road and not make the, least noise, so well are the wheels cov- ered with soft hair.

We skinned a goose, put on some of the Onguent, and in two hours the feather- grower was enveloped in hair like a squirrel, and was seen this morning trying to climb a shaghark hickory in the back-yard. A little applied to the inkstand has given it a coat of bristles, making a splendid pen-wiper at little cost. We applied the lather to a tenpenny nail, and the nail is now the handsomest lather-brush you ever saw, with a beautiful growth of soft hair at the end of it, some five or six feet in length. Only a dollar a cake! Applied to door stones, it does away with the use of a mat. Applied to a floor, it will cause to grow therefrom hair sufficient for a Brussels carpet. A little of this Onguent lather was accidentally dropped on the head of our cane, which has been perfectly bald for over ten years, and immediately a thick growth of hair formed, completely covering it: compelling us to shave the head twice a week.

Then he sneezed out of one nose. Then he sneezed out-of the other. Then he sneezed' out of both at once. Three times.

I was disgusted, and I thought of the person who attempted a sea voyage on the sea of Galilee, was sea-sick, disgusted, and got out and walked!" Deacon Brown looked at his wife, but neither of them smiled. It was the mustard! In person Mr. Dickens resembles his pictures quite much, but the resemblance is not so strik- ing as it was. Mr. Dickens brought a few intimate friends with him to this country, the society here being so poor, and it is now his intention to visit a few of the wealthy but honest families of New York and Boston with his select party, for the purpose of giving us Americans lessons in manners, politeness, and civilization without mustad!
