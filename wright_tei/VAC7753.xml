TREGO SHERTZER, M .., In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C.  To my mother,  THS WORK IS MOST RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED,  BY THE AUTHOR.  &#xD;<pb n="0" xml:id="VAC7753-00000003"/>  CHAPTER I L Now from the town,          !! Buried in smoke, and sleep and noisome damps,  Oft let me wander o'er the dewy fields, Where freshness breathes.-THOMSON. LET us introduce you, gentle reader, to the little village of Churchville, con- : taining probably a dozen buildings of an ordinary class, including a church,A hotel, post-office, the traditional black- smith shop, and a school-house for  the accommodation of the neighboring youth. Within the walls of this latter  structure the old and young of both sexes frequently meet, if not on business, to see and, seen, and hear the general gossip of the neigh- borhood. It would be superfluous to observe that those who compose these friendly gatherings are of the class whose daily bread is earned by the sweat of their brows, the muscular, hard-handed and warm hearted yeomanry of the land, who though they may not possess an extensive store of the world's goods, are owners of a stock of far greater value, and these are the traits of integrity, truth and &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7753-00000004"/> 6 honesty, -the characteristics of a loyal Christian peo- ple. , The elder portion of the male population bear a strong resemblance to the old Puritan patriarchs, and if not engaged as traders or mechanics in the village, they contribute to the railis of the sur- rounding country farmers, and to these belong the credit of supplying the masses of the land with cereals and the provender essential to both man and beast. Reader, perchance you have never visited a farm, and observed how laborious are the duties of the husbandman, nor viewed his toil beneath the burning rays of the midday sun, and which to you would doubtless seem a systematic curse, a course of bootless penance. Were you one of a reflecting turn of mind, you would stand and profoundly wonder to see the farmer prepare his ground with plow and harrow, then sow his seed, all necessitating no small degree of manual labor, and at the close of which he must patiently wait a long and anxious season ere he can cut and house the products of the soil. Adjoining the village-we have briefly described, lives farmer Sharp, the owner of an ordinary country house, yet with a fine and well stocked farm at- tached. He is regarded as a thrifty, hard working map, his family consisting only of a wife and one lad, his, son Joseph, a bright-eyed boy of twelve years, with a pleasing address and habitual smile, who appears good naturedly ever ready to pursue the toils of the day, and if we watch him, will find ie is first at the plow or harrow, anon feeding stock,   gathering stone, or cutting wood, engaged in fac" in all the varied duties required of a farm hand; but further, after a hard day's work, we shall mark him, book in hand, trying to master some knotty problem long after the other inmates of the humble dwelling have retired to rest. This is the accustomed prac- tice of the studious lad during the entire summer months, whilst on the day of rest, the church or Sunday-school only will attract him from his books, his constant companions. During the winter months our hero is the regular attendant of a country school, where he has no opportunity of acquiring the higher branches of learning, and we may well surmise he has but few short hours for study, having the farm stock to feed and many other^ incumbent duties to perform -incidental to a country life. Joseph Sharp is, however, as will be hereafter acknowledged, no ordinary youth; he is ambitious, and from .a natural love to master his studies, soon places -himself at the head of every class, though often sorely wounded with the unfeeling remarks of the elder portion of the village inhabitants. "There is Joe Sharp," they would say, " an un- educated and ordinary farm boy, with a dictionary- a latin grammar, or some other book, walking about here with it in lhis pocket, and from the way he is studying, lie is fool enougll to believe he will one day become a great man, and ride about ChurchIville like Doctor F., or Lawyer A." Was Joe intimidated bythese surly observations? No; they caused, in truth, a imere brilliant fame to  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7753-00000005"/> 8 burn upon the altar of his ambition ; he studied the more, devoting his spare time to the elucidation and solution of matters pertaining to natural philosophy and the classics. Thus it will ever be found that a course of unreasoning opposition, and the rude com- ments of the ignorant, beget in the spirited youth or man of mature age a proud and lofty determi- nation to conquer the petty prejudices of stupid humanity, and to plant the standard of merit, however humble or obscure, triumphant on every field.- At the age of fourteen, through his unaided indi- vidual energies, Joseph Sharp had mastered his studies to that degree of perfection, that he was en- abled to be admitted into the county academy, located in Belair, where for the present we shall leave the brave lad, and direct the readers atten- tion to his antipode, Robert Dull, a youth who, to use the com  n expression, was born with a silver spoon in Iis moth, and in this connection a slight digres- sion mayjot be inopportune. The useful article with which at table we sip our coffee or our tea, as the case may be, is unquestionably an indispensable addition to the comfort of the family circle, corresponding with Tupper's baby, " a well-spring of joy in every house." We have not the slightest disposition to dispute the fact, but yet, " ye gods defend us, (though there mnay be exceptions, as it is said there is to all rules,) from the male infant who is ushered into the breathing world with a spoon--a silver spoon in his mouth. The advent of such a one-is a common   calamity-another drone added to the great hive of human industry, where space becomes every year more requisite for the industrious bee. The capital misfortune with these gentry, this class who " toil not, neither do they spin," appears simply to be that they cannot be led to concede the great truth that the pernicious, debilitating tendencies of bodily pleasure, need to be counteracted by the invigorating exercises of bodily labor; hence they are as a rule in every one's way until the grave-digger conceals them from view. Robert Dull, at the period of our introduction, was but thirteen years of age, and the only son of a rich banker, whose flourishing farm and princely mansion immediately adjoined the lands of Mr. Sharp. The banker, as is the fatal error in the case of too many wealthy and over indulgent parents, had taught his son and heir to regard work as a disgrace, and those who labored for a living as beneath his notice; and so apt was the future owner of the manor to heed these wretched teachings, that he considered it beneath his dignityor the exalted position of a banker's son, to hold converse with the farmer boys who were his only neighbors, and if addressed by one of them, would turn aside with haughty air, exclaim-' ing to himself, "How dare that insolent plebeian speak to me." Being sent to a private school kept by Mr. A.', some three miles from his father's man- sion, Robert could be seen morning and evening galloping his fine mare called Topsey, and when enjoying this exercise, although he would frequently   &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7753-00000006"/> 10 encounter young Sharp and other lads upon the road, the proud youth would never fail to give loose rein to his favorite, and spur past them in silence. As the reader may desire to know something of the ancestors of Robert Dull, we shall here honor them with a brief allusion. In early life his father was familiar with poverty, having been born and partly raised in an humble shanty on the right bank  of Deer Creek, but developing a fair share of business tact, was sent when a youth to Baltimore, and became a clerk in'a leading bankin-g-house, froom  which position in the course of years he was elevated to that of a partner in the firm. Eventually having married Miss E., a proud and haughty belle of his native county, their union was blessed with the boy Robert, the subject of the foregoing sketch. The position of influence and wealth acquired by the banker in late years made his entire family rela- tionship consider themselves the elite of the neigh- borhood, and never failed to manifest by their actions and manners to all with whom they came in contact, their sense of self-importance, "'Tis an old maxim in the schools, That flattery 's the food of fools." And a bountiful repast of the article it may correctly be surmised awaited the rising:generation of Dulls, when the head of the race became known as a mil- lionaire.  Now, for the information of the unin- formed reader, the author would remark that there is a peculiar fruit believed to be almost if not quite indigenous to the soil of the Western hemisphere,  .   at least it is one of which our Republican orchards are singularly prolific, and it is known to naturalists as the genus "Codfishata, Aristocrata,' or codfish arlistocracy--a bitter and unseemly looking fruit and invariably rotten at the core l- Both love of mankind and respect for their rights are duties. The former, however, is only a conditional, whilst the latter is an unconditional, purely imperative duty, but yet with men of the class of our banker, it is a duty neither recognized nor performed; hence the less fortunate but more deserving ones with whom cir- cumstances compelled a temporary association, were in all cases treated with that arrogant, supercilious air so prevalent with the would-be aristocrat, who forgets that he is, to a great extent, dependent upon the " hewer of wood and drawer of water." Frequently a social gathering or party would be given in honor of Master Robert, when the sons and daughters of Judge T., Lawyer A., Doctor H. and others would be invited to enjoy the festivities of the occasion, but the children of such men as farmer Sharp and his humble neighbors were made marked exceptions to such invitations; and it was as well, for could these poor neglected ones have been present their ears would have tingled with such remarks as the annexed: "What do you think, Miss A. or Mr. B. had the impudence to speak to me last Sunday at Church; did you ever know- anything like it- what a   pity that persons in their stations of life have not better sense; they ought to know better than to address any but their own class and so   &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7753-00000007"/> 12 on. Whilst Master Robert laughs at the presump- tion of Joe Sharp in attending the Belair Academy, and is heard to say, c, He is fool enough to imagine that he can graduate from that institution and re- ceive some good appointment, and be admitted into society;" adding, " he will soon be thrown out of the academy, and then he will have to return to his father's old farm. Just wait until I get there; I will make it hot for him, and he will only be too glad to leave, and then he will learn his proper station."     ' How different would have been the language of the envious and presumptuous youth, could he have foreseen the future; for in his coming rivalry with the brave ambitious farmer's boy he was to realize that a dull boy (or man) is so near a dead man, that he is hardly to be ranked in the list of the living; l and as he is not to be buried whilst he is half alive, so he is not to be employed whilst he is half dead. We are now to record the entree of Master Robert Dull into the well-known academy of Belair, which took place the first of September, the commencement of the regular term; but previous however to enter- ing upon an academical life he engaged his leisure moments in a series of calls, never failing to make poor Joe, whose name has already been placed on the list of academy students, appear in a ridiculous light, if possible, to effect, that object. Wherever he goes, even to the village-store, though Joe Sharp may be present to hear his abuse, he scornfully ridicules the idea of his daring to compete in his ,    studies with one of the elite, a gentleman's son, a banker's son; and it is to be regretted that in this systematic course of defamation, the youth would at titnies enlist the co-operation of the more ignorant villagers, who had insensibly adopted a feeling of jealousy of our hero, on account of his progress and worthy amblition; and as he quietly withdraws from the presence of his enemies, calls are made after him to return and make them a speech, or inform them what he intends to study and so on. As we have stated, some of Joseph's former com- panions and pretended friends, in imitation of the brethren of his great namesake of Israel, have grown jealous of his superior qualities, and basely adopted Robert Dull as their leader, endorsing his- Sbitter denunciations of the youthful farmer, and he is consequently reduced to the necessity of commun- ing with his own thoughts, his most intimate asso- ciates having addicted themselves to the prevalent fashion of making sport of his noble ambition. This course of unworthy treatment, however, stim- ulates him the more eagerly to prosecute his studies, being determined not to relinquish the aspirations which fill his inmost heart, and which even his  immature judgment convince him must eventually triumph; and moved also with the, conviction that to abandon now his position of eminence, would be to gratify the malignant -enmity of his antagonists. Hence he is inspired with -a renewed resolution to entertain no such word asfail, and to place opp)osi- tion beneath his feet. Furthermore, not a lmurmur  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7753-00000008"/> of complaint escapes the lips of the brave lad, for his heart is filled with the true spirit of manliness, his chief object appearing to be to offend no one, rea- soning within himself that kind words are never forgotten, and perhaps cheer in'their remembrance a long, sad existence, whilst those of careless cruelty are like wounds in the bosom, leaving scars that may be borne to the grave. There exists in human nature a disposition to murmur at the calamities and disappointments inci- dent to life, rather than to- acknowledge with grat- itude the blessings by which they are more than counterbalanced. He is a great self-poised character whom praise unnerves; he is a still greater one who supports unjust censure; but greater again is he who, with acknowledged powers, represses his envy and turns to use undeserved censure.  There is nothing purer than honesty; nothing warmer than' love; nothing more bright than virtue; nothing more steadfast than faith  These united in one mind form the purest, the sweetest, the richest, the brightest, the holiest, the most steadfast happiness. The noble traits recited above Were well combined in the character of Joseph Sharp, and he had also learned in the severe school of life young as he was, that the wisdom of a poor man goes but little ways, while the loquacity of a rich fool carries everything before it, and impressed with this salutary knowl- edge, his gentle nature freely forgave the enmity of the banker's son. How many in this world overlook the stern fact   that we are depending upon one another, that from the cradle to the grave we cannot exist without mutual help, and that the race of mankind would perish -from the earth did they cease to aid each other; and, therefore, with this admission all who need assistance have a right to ask it from  their fellow-beings, and no one who holds the power of granting it can refuse it without mortal guilt! Joe fought hard against temper; he resisted it stoutly, for, as he reasoned with himself, I' a fit of passion may -cause me to mourn all the days of my life, and it is better I should never revenge an injury." To remember a foul injury is ofttimes pru- dent, but to cultivate revenge unchristian-like "and foolish, or, as we have heard it well expressed, "I will not be revenged, and this I owe to my enemy; but I will remember, .nd this I owe to myself." He that revengeth knows no rest; The meek possess a peaceful breast. O Water falling day by day Wears the hardest rock away. &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7753-00000009"/> CHAPTER II. -HE time has now arrived when these two, lads, so dissimilar in character, are to enter upon their first term at the academy. No word of complaint has yet escaped the lips of Joseph Sharp, though he well knows the idle gossips around his native village have never ceased to denounce his under-' taking, and in' addition have freely circulated all manner of reports to the effect that his name had been erased from the list of students. Being a prudent youth he has wisely kept his own council, and borne their slurs and falsehoods with silent patience, asking only the God of justice to aid him in his efforts, and with the daily prayer that he might be enabled after the completion of his studies to convince his many enemies that his laud- able ambition had been crowned with success, and the highest honors awarded his exertions. The country appeared bright and beautiful in its summer garb, and the birds were busy warbling their joyous notes on that lovely opening day of autumn, when the rival youths, mounted on their good steeds, ap-   17 proached by different roads the county metropolis, and, after entering its streets, found grouped around their future theatre of action-the academy--a for- midable :number of young men and lads, who were hailing each other with humor and song; and as many of them have not met during their vacation, it may be surmised they renew the old acquaintance with the hearty grip of congratulation only known to school-boys, expressing meanwhile in their bois-. terous manner the gratification of spending another fall and winter term together. Here and there can be seen a kind father or fond mother, driving up to the institution with a hopeful scion, and introducing him to the professors and those of the students they may chance to know. - Undoubtedly in this busy assemblage there were those who in former days had been accustomed to encounter:each other in the manner of our copper-colored warriors of the West, with the war-paint upon their faces and with all the intensity of boyish dislike for a successful rival. Yet, as absence conquers love (though our fair friends will not admit it), so it will dissipate in youthful breasts many a festering sore that once threatened to be a standing grievance, and our. future Presidents having happily buried the hatchet, with commendable wisdom  arrived at the conclu- sion that when you bury animosity, do not set up a stone over its gravel Robert Dull found many of his late fellow-.students and acquaintances in the throng, and for the present we shall leave him bus- ily engaged in interchanging friendlv remarks. 2*  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7753-00000010"/> 18 As the students are all collected in the academy enclosure eagerly conversing, Joe Sharp, with his customary benignant smile, makes his entry on the scene, politely bowing to the boys though a stranger to them all, and passes on to the hall of learning. Here, with wonted manliness, lie wends his way with cheerful step to the Principal of the academy and in- tr6duces- himself, being in turn introduced to the remaining professors, an act of courtesy, by the way, entirely overlooked by Dull and the others who are about commencing their academical life. This act, as might be expected, left a favorable impression at once in the minds of the faculty, who unanimously wished him success in his new career, and with the insight natural to experienced men, in private agreed that our hero had the bearing of one who in future days would in all probability become a useful sup- port, and not a pernicious incumbrance to society. As Joe, after his introduction to his teachers, loitered among the group of scholars collected out- side, he distinctly heard the tones of the arrogant Dull addressing a companion thus: "Ha I that fool of a country clodhopper had better go back to his father's farm, where he belongs, and not make such an ass of himself as to come here and try to get brains put into his head." Poor Joe, who had thoroughly acquired ,the gift of forbearance, did not however pay the least notice to the contemptuous remark, and passed on without uttering a word, fully as determined to preserve a policy of dignified silence as was his antagonist to   19 take advantage of the opening of the term to preju- dice the minds of his fellow students against the unoffending youth, and by strewing his path with harassing annoyances, force him eventually to abandon the field of his ;studies. There is beauty- enough on earth to make a home for angels ; and yet, oh! do we not daily realize that the perverse passions and ill-nature of men and even of youth, blindly, aye, willfully, transform Elysium into Hades; and amongst the evil traits thus warring against the gen- eral happiness which should otherwise prevail, where are the equals, in their baleful influence, of envy and arrogant pride? The former, in the language of Ovid, " feeds- upon the living, and it is only- after death that every -man's well-earned honors defend him against -calumny ;" and the wretched owner of purse-proud arrogance, though alive to the fact that the greatest of 'monarchs lnust at length go to bed with a shovel, will yet continue th crush the unfortu- nate heir of poverty into the earth, regardless of the doom pronounced against the rich man. It is by no means complimentary to our haughty owners of bank stocks and princely estates, that they should possess less penetration than the rooster in the fable, who spurned the diamond and wished for the barley-corn, it being understood that in-the age of acorns, antecedent to Ceres and the royal plough- man, a single barley-corn was .of more value to mankind, or- the feathered race, than all the dia- monds that glowed in the mines of. India. Thus, to a sagacious individual of we alth, the living grain I!               "'vnr &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7753-00000011"/> 20 represented by the poor man, if he be honest and intelligent, is of more inestimable value than piles of glittering metal-a substance which cannot be conveyed beyond the portals of the tomb. Let us now return to a review of the movements of our juvenile friends. As usual on the opening day of the session, all was bustle and confusion, little else being done than reading and assigning the morrow's lessons, and these chiefly consisted of spell- ing and definitions, Joseph appearing more than usually meditative on the morning of re-assembling, his thoughts being occupied with the importance of this commencement of an era which was to fore-  shadow future success, or in case of failure, blighted prospects forever. It appeared that the brains of the young students had not been much exercised on the subject of orthography, for when the tutor gave out' the word anthropology, it traveled down the entire class unsuccessfully until reaching Joseph, he mastered it without hesitation, and as he walked past Robert Dull to assume the head of the class, he plainly observed an expression of withering hatred upon the countenance of that hopeful competitor, whilst-good nature was stamped on the faces of the other lads.  Inspired with this early success, our hero, through close application, continued to main- tain his position, winning withal, through his'kind and gentle disposition, the respect and confidence of his fellow students, a fact that served to incite still greater animosity in the breast of Robert Dull, and it was manifest in his looks and actions on all /    21 occasions when its display could be rendered most conspicuous. However, the unwelcome truth was becoming more and more evident to the upstart pre- tender that his airs of self-importance were waning in their influence with the students of Belair acad- emy; and what was a still more obnoxious pill to swallow, was the admission which he was reluc- tantly compelled to make, that he was intellectually inferior to Joe Sharp, and that in a competitive examination he would experience an inglorious defeat. He began in fact to realize the truism, immature and narrow minded as were his faculties, that ,c worth has been underrated ever since wealth has been over valued." Amongst the enemies of poor Joe in- his native village, was a Doctor R., a young man who had just commenced the practice of medicine, and who, with a pompous air, had predicted an utter failure for the farmer's son at the academy. As an offset, however, to this prediction, Doctor E.. a kind, genial old gentleman, residing in Belair, claimed for young Sharp a distinguished future, and as an endorsement of the good opinion, Mr. H., a well-known advocate residing inl the same town, manifested a fatherly interest in the youth, and when occasion offered, would aid him with his advice. Beyond question the ambition to rise in life, together with a host of superior qualities, had gained considerable notoriety for the child of the humble farmer throughout the county, and his career as a student had excited un- usual interest and was narrowly observed by friends  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7753-00000012"/> and foes. Having elicited from the first the favorable opinion of his teachers, he had also, as time wore on, drawn to his person the sympathies and respect of very many of his brother students, whose original welcome was one of contumely and insult. In the academy at the date of these events, were a number of older and well-bred youths, sons .of influential families, and amongst others who kindly rendered our hero assistance whenever required, were Wmrn. P. Dorsey, now assistant Professor at West Point, and Win. Seton, a prominent member of the Harford county bar. In contrast to the involuntary social good feeling which the action of Joe elicited, was the reserve and distance preserved toward Dull, owing to the repelling influence of his proud and imperious nature, hence his friends were few, and he was frequently left to study alone. Close to the seat of learning was a young ladies' seminary, upder charge of the Misses T., and pos- sessing a wide-spread reputation it was largely attended by the young ladies of Harford and adjoin- ing counties. The rules of both institutions were rigidly enforced, one of which strictly prohibited the young ladies and gentlemen from visiting or speak- ing, consequently there was but little opportunity for forming acquaintance, yet as both sexes were affected with the weakness so peculiar to our nature, that of sociability, they would frequently meet, acci- dentally of course. Through the intervention of an estimable old lady, Mrs. Belgrade, a neighbor of his father's, Joe was  , .   permitted to keep his steed in the stables belonging to the seminary. He became thereby enabled to hold a brief chat with some of the lively and charming young inmates of the establishment, and ere long became, from the advantage of his position, an im- provised mail-carrier, being frequently the recipient of a host of epistles from the young ladies to their admirers, and naturally charged with the same duty by the latter; and through this channel our hero was not only making himself of importances but en- hancing his popularity with both sexes; and in truth, his movements before and after school hours were regarded with a flutter of expectation, especially on the part of the ladies (we hope bur fair readers will excuse this exception in their behalf') that was quite amusing, and the ears of the youth became soon. quite familiarized with such expressions as : "Bless your dear soul," or "Dear Joe, I have been waiting for you this hour," or "You precious jewel, I thought you never would get here," or "Ain't he- kind-thelie sweetest young man I know," and many other en- dearing terms peculiar to the daughters of Eve. "Tis true his nature may with faults abound, But who will cavil when the heart is sound?" And how is it possible for the gentle reader to reproach poor Joe, if in this mass of lively maidens, this parterre of lovely human flowers, he became at length entangled in the meshes of that all powerful passion, love? Among the most fascinating of our lady friends was a beautiful blonde, in her sixteenth year, a daughter of Judge A., one of the most aristo-   &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7753-00000013"/> 24 cratic gentlemen of Harford. Yet, as {c the course of true love never did run smooth," our hero's suliit proved no exception to the rule. Young Sharp plead his case with all the eloquence of a veteran advocate, but Miss Lilhe was inexorable. She would cheer- fully enrol herself among his friends, but beyond that he must cease to regard her, and to assure him- self now and ever after that their widely different station in the scale of social life presented an im- passible barrier to any relations more endearing than one of ordinary friendship. These sentiments of the haughty beauty, delivered in a tone of cold decision, which left no room to doubt their earnest sincerity, filled for a season the frank, warm heart of the young student with a chilling sensation of despair; yet he strove gallantly to suppress his mor- tification and wounded pride at the rejection of his suit, trusting in his inexperience and in the san- guine views ever nourished in the spring time of our existence, that time would effect miracles, and that when he should be prepared to assume his position among men in the great contest of life, the heart of his loved one would become more tractable, and that she would then regard his ardent admiration in a more favorable light. "While yet a child, and long before his time, He had perceived the presence and the power Of greatness." And in these lines of Wordsworth the reader will discover the key-note to all the springs of action in the career of Joseph Sharp. His observation and   his reading had revealed beyond successful contra- diction that ( the presence and power of greatness " inevitably commanded compliance with one's wishes and aspirations; that influence and power must be attained through worldly wealth, or the display of intellectual qualities which would insure exalted station, and to attain the full fruition of his hopes, that he must strive with a degree of daring ambition hitherto unknown to him, to rise above the disad- vantages of humble lineage and irksome poverty; and not only this, his ardent spirit and brave heart rebelled at the mere thought of failure, and the malicious sneers that were sure to follow him: in the event of non-success. The young student was not insensible to the difficulties surrounding his pursuit of Miss Ardenne, and amongst others, the probability of encountering formidable rivals in the wealthy and influential gentry of the neighborhood 'who were constant visitors at the residence of the Judge, her father; and as she was the only'child and the heiress of an immense estate, Lillie Ardenne could not be supposed to have escaped the terms of adulation to which the favored child of fortune is ever exposed. But besides the advantages of birth and social position inherited by the object of Joseph Slarp's admiration, she was possessed of those per- sonal attractions so irresistible in the eyes of most men. With a tall and graceful figure she united a superb complexion, extremely expressive eyes of charming blue, over-shadowed with drooping lashes, and a melodious voice that thrilled all those within  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7753-00000014"/> its sound; and were it not for a certain habitual air of disdain with which she regarded those whom she considered her inferiors, but few could have resisted according her the homage of their love. But in com- mon with too many spoiled, beauties, the subject of these lines had substituted formal good manners for' hearty good nature, and as is usual in such cases, the sensible of both sexes are weaned from any further cultivation of the acquaintance. Had Lillie possessed more softness of heart, or a greater dread of rivalry in her lady friends, doubtless she would have proved more accessible to the attentions of the gentlemen, for not only were there a score or two of marriageable girls in the vicinity, many of whom would have proved very eligible matches, but there were also many spinsters of forty years and upwards, who, remembering that while life lasts there is hope, were not wholly in despair ; but pluming herself as elevated above the claims of any one rival, she chose rather to be indifferent to all, hence the proud girl continued to be content with idle flattery on the one hand, and cold respect upon the other, unaware perhaps, that many people are esteemed merely because they are not known.   COHAPTER      III., I  still had hopes, for pride attends us still, Amidst the swains to show my book-learned skill, Around my fire an evening group to draw, And tell of all I felt, and all I saw.   TWO years have passed since the events recorded in our last chapter, and the student, although he frequently met with Miss Ardenne at church and elsewhere, had as yet failed in all his efforts to win the heiress from her tone' of calm indifference. The period of his academical life was now drawing to a close, and as the final examina- tion progressed, it was manifest to all that Joseph had been a close student, as he mastered with ease the many difficult problems which he was called upon to solve, and graduated with distinguished honor, whilst his rival, Robert Dull, was on the verge of failure had it not been for timely assistance rendered him by an intimate associate. And now, having ended their career in Belair, they returned to their homes to enjoy a brief vacation and arrange plans for an unknown future. Possibly they enter- tained a species of boyish regret at parting with   &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7753-00000015"/> 28 familiar scenes and the friends endeared to them by a four years' companionship, yet youth is vola- tile and we may safely affirm  ' Their souls are ready to depart-- No thought rebels; the obedient heart Breathes fortli no sigh." And we have equally to affirm that even now, that Joe has reached his father's farm with a well-earned diploma, his ancient enemies of the village, true to their original animosity, claim that surely there must have been some mistake in the report of his having graduated with such credit to himself, and to add as it were a certain emphasis to this wretched gossip, would address him on the country roads as Professor, Judge Sharp, and in other ironical terms. All this pertinacious and idle emnity was however passed unheeded by their victim, the equanimity of whose disposition was not at all disturbed, and who felt with a glow of hone'st pride that he whose tal- ents had been publicly recognized by a superior authority, could afford to look down with disdain upon ignorant foes. As man or youth advances in life he becomes less and less identified with surrounding associations, and-as he begins to have a glimpse of the limit of his journey, his thoughts revert to the checkered scenes through which he has 'passed, and is consoled with the knowledge that they have already been encountered and can no longer annoy him. In this retrospect, circumstances, whether of danger, trial, or happiness, are regarded alike, not indeed with   29 indifference, but with that feeling of security which nothing but a triumph over past vicissitudes could produce. Hence, the weary pilgrim of life lingers over the memory of the past, and is so far selfish in his enjoyments, that he neither expects nor receives the sympathy of those around him. If distance lends enchantment to the uncertain future of his youth, objects beheld through the vista of the past, by a wise provision of nature, lose but little of their former freshness, and whilst passing incidents are speedily forgotten amidst the accumulated cares of age, the scenes and impressions of early life are re- membered with promptness and precision, and often form the chief topic both of thought and conversa- tion, as if to draw the mind off from the cares, ills, and infelicities that press upon it. This is a theme endeared to us by a thousand interesting associa- tions, the scene of so many trying events in our youthful days. The period under consideration is also important in another respect. A new character was developing itself in the minds of Robert and Joseph, with all the obligations of providing for their self-government, and of cultivating' the re- sources which  nature had so bountifully extended to them. Some weeks after his arrival at home, our hero was surprised one morping at the reception of the followingsbrief note from a medical friend of the family: PHLADELPHA, July 2, 18-- . MR. JOSEPH SHARP: Dear Sir-If you will call upon me at once, I will be able to give you a good position in my hospital, where you will have a 33&#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7753-00000016"/> 30 chance to study medicine, with ample time to attend medical lectures this winter. Do not come until you have consulted your fthller, and decided that you should like the profession. Let me hear from you at once. Truly, your friend,  DR. H   D. It is needless to remark that Joseph was over- joyed on receiving the above lines, for he had longed to study medicine, and upon receiving a ready assent to do so from his indulgent, father, he at once wrote the annexed reply :' CHURCHVILLE, July 7, 18--. DR. H   . My Kind Friend--Your very acceptable favor 2d inst. at hand, with many thanks for the honor conferred. I have father's per- mission and will leave, in the steamel from Baltimore, to-morrow U at 3 P. M. In accepting your kind offer, I promise strict obe- dience and close application to my duties. I am, dearsir, truly yours, JOSEPH SHARP. The ambitious youth at once commenced prepar- ing for his new field of duty, feeling greatly elated at his good fortune, and picturing to himself the bright future that he did not for an instant doubt awaited him.  Promptly at the hour announced for the departure of the steamer the student ascended, the gangway, passing at once into the cabin, to rest and refresh himself after the tiresome and dusty summer trip fromhis ,native Harford. Buried in pleasing meditations on the new career now opening before him it was long ere his gaze rested upon the countenances of his fellow-passengers, and the reader can more correctly imagine than describe the min- gled sensation, of surprise, of pain and pleasure,         ,   with which those eyes were dazzled in beholding the lovely image of Lillie Ardenne. It was indeed the imperious yet charming belle of Harford whose form reclined upon a lounger but a few feet distant from our hero. If she had known of his presence heretofore Miss Ardenne did not discover the cir- cumstance in her reception as with prompt courtesy he arose to salute the fair girl. "This is indeed an unlooked for pleasure," said the student, as he extended his hand. "I have been enjoying a brief season in the'city, Mr. Sharp," was the reply, with a slight inclination of the head, " and am now on my way to visit some of father's relatives in the city of Philadelphia." "As I shall for some months be a resident of that metropolis, I trust to have the honor of an early call upon Miss Ardenne." "As you please, Mr. Sharp, and my .present direction will be Hon. George Campbell, Clinton Place." To one of a less sanguine temperament, the non- chalance and tone of frigid coolness that character- ized the language of Miss Ardenne, would have suggested a final farewell to the most distant hope of securing a return to any warmer sentiment than languid esteem, but Joseph Sharp was not thus to be dismayed. His deep-rooted attaclhmeht migiht be termed one of an aggressive character, and guided by such impulses, he determined upon an- other, should it even prove a final and unsuccessful, assault upon the strong citadel of her affections.   &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7753-00000017"/> 32 "1 shall avail myself of the honor you ipermit me to enjoy at the earliest opportunity, which -will be to-morrow evening," remarked the student, as on landing he handed Lillie to a carriage in waiting, and bidding her adieu, traced his way to the institution in charge of his new found friend- and patron, who, on his entrance greeted lhim withl a cordial welcome. The routine of hospital life, uninteresting and repul- sive as the daily round may appear to the majority of readers, possessed for Joseph Sharp a singular attraction; for was it not upon this 'field that the primary victories in the great struggle, that was to insure him eminence in the future were to be ob- tained?  Was it not within these walls that the corner-stone of future greatness, of cherished hopes so long entertained, was to be laid? Here was to be developed that natural genius, that inclination to, untiring labor,- that spirit of laudable ambition, which, at the close of a mortal career, would entitle him to the poet's praise: "Lives of great men all remind us We may mnake our lives sublime,  And departing, leave behind us Foot-prints in the sands of time." -It was well for the student that his buoyant na- ture and lofty aspirations kept pace with the inten- sity of his passion for the judge's daughter, for in the very commencement of his city life he was destined to encounter one of those rude shocks so well calculated in inferior minds to destroy the fond anticipations of youthful dreams. Cherishing,    . I  33 although somewhat at variance with his better judgment, bright visions of happy moments with the fair one who had so disturbed his equanimity on former occasions, he repaired on the second evening of his arrival to the stately mansion in Clinton Place, and inquiring for Miss Ardenne, he was ushered into a sumptuous apartment, furnished with all that modern taste and elegance could sug- gest, and brilliant with the light afforded by a princely chandelier.  Laying the small volume which she had been listlessly perusing on the centre- table, Lillie Ardenne arose with a scarcely percepti- ble look of recognition to greet her visitor, and motioning to a seat, sank with an air of ennui upon a lounge placed near the bay-window of the parlor. The youthful admirer, with that frank sincerity ever commendable, albeit not in unison with the flimsy formality of modern usage, entered upon the conversation with the smiling remark: "I have presumed, Miss Lillie, if I may dare ad- dress you in the familiar terms of other days, to seek this early renewal of an acquaintance that I regard as among the happiest mementoes; of my boyhood, trusting it may not interfere with prior engagements or the pleasure you have promised yourself during your stay in the city." "My gentlemen acquaintance, recent or other- wise, are always welcome, Mr. Sharp," "May I claim then to hope," renewed the young man, whilst a rising color suffused his countenance, "that the sentiments once expressed, and the hum- &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7753-00000018"/> 34 ble- attentions so gladly bestowed may not, at the present day, be found unworthy the acceptance and regard of' one whom I have never ceased to admire."'  A painful pause succeeded this frank avowal, during which the heart of the student throbbed violently, but the suspense was of brief duration. "Mr. Sharp," slowly replied the haughty girl, raising slightly from the half recumbent posture she had chosen up to this moment, and as she pro- ceeded a derisive smile marred her handsome fea- tures, " during the brief stay I propose to myself in this -city, I shall have neither leisure, nor, I must peremptorily add, inclination for the cultivation of the sentiments you would advance, and of which you naturally wish a return; yet, as a lady, and without desiring to be abrupt, you will pardon the repetition of the assertion once candidly made you, that your station does not warrant urging upon one in my sphere of life any closer intimacy than you already enjoy. This is my irrevocable decision, and if it be your desire to oppose it, it remains only for Miss Ardenne to request a cessation of your visits.."' Without the courtesy of an adieu, the aristocratic and imperious maiden swept from the apartment,- leaving the aspirant for her hand speechless and with a keen sense of humiliation to make a farewell exit from the mansion, and thus rudely, yet happily, as the sequel will discover, terminated the first essay of Joseph Sharp in the dangerous but ever exciting field of love.    CHAP TER IV I "Vows made in storms are forgotten in calms."  , ON the morning after the rejection of his suit by Lillie Ardenne, our hero arose betimes, his heart imbued with the conviction "so forcibly impressed upon all in their pilgrimage of life, that the brightest dreams awaken to the darkest realities, yet with the con- soling reflection as he pondered the subject in his breast, that silks and satins put out the kitchen fire, and that in this final separation from a fascinating but unworthy idol, from one who: could thus haughtily and unmerci- fully discard a generous, though perchance a pre- mature attachment, he was but escaping an ominous cloud that would have overshadowed   his entire future, enervating and finally destroying every noble attribute of his being, and reducing him to the unenviable position of a mere follower at the heels of fashion, or the sham pretenders whose only tolerance in society was founded upon their display of a brilliant equipage, or a formidable array of unpaid tailor's bills. The dissipation of his recent 35&#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7753-00000019"/> 36 views resulted also in this advantage, that he was left undisturbed to prosecute his medical investiga- tions, and so devotedly did he enter upon this pur- suit, that in very few months the-physicians in' attendance pronounced him a most apt and promis- ing student, and in confirmation of this favorable opinion of his merits, he was more than once left in charge of the hospital in the absence of the resident physician. On these occasions, through his amenity of manner in receiving visitors and friends of the inmates, he acquired a degree of popularity, eventually ripening into friendly and intimate rela- tions with prominent citizens, whose influence in his behalf could not be otherwise than advantageous, and what was of equal importance, the privilege thus acquired of visiting and mingling in reputable society was invaluable, as it led insensibly to a pol- ished and refined demeanor, to which otherwise he might have remained a stranger for many years. Being considered sufficiently advanced in his studies, it was now determined to initiate Joseph into certain disagreeable but incumbently necessary mysteries connected with his new profession, and accordingly taking advantage of a dark and stormy evening, when the earth seemed shaken to its centre with the rattling peals of thunder, he was introduced to the cemetery at the lower end of the hospital grounds. Descending into a gloomy vault and closing the door behind them, his companions now lit their lan- terns, and raising a corpse from one of the many, receptacles of the- dead that were ranged on the   shelves of the charnel house, they commenced the workl of dissection. The reader may correctly imagine that in the midst of this revolting' operation and with such surroundings, the hairs of Joseph Sharp's head, in ordinary phrase, " stood on end," while the young blood in his veins nearly froze in its course, and he felt perfectly unable to command the wonted will of his rigid muscles. But let it not be supposed that this trying ordeal disheartened our hero, for after fully recovering from the primary shock, he pursued the course of his medical studies withl more deter- mination than-ever. For a brief period it now becomes our duty to scan the movements of Robert Dull immediately subsequent to his return from Belair. Since that era his life had been one of perfect idleness, until the following winter, when he determined to study medicine at the University of Maryland. He had not forgotten however meanwhile to indulge in his usual defamatory remarks of the farmer's son, of wlhom he observed after ascertaining his good for- tune in procuring position in Philadelphia, that it was a disgrace one of his menial condition snould be installed in so responsible a berth, :ading that he would doubtless soon be discharged and sent , back in dishonor Ito his native village. "It is the nature of the human disposition," says Tacitus, "to hate' him whom you have injured." Hence this insolent, imperious youth, after he had detracted in every way possible for a series of years 4   &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7753-00000020"/> 38 from the charmater of his: unoffending neighbor, now hated him  with a keener relish than in the days when his natural ability made him  not only a suc- cessfiul competitor, but his peer and his superior. Such are the vicissitudes of the world that day and night, labor and rest, hurry and retirement, endear each other. Such are the changes that keep the mind in action. We desire, we pursue, we ob- tain, we are satiated; we desire something else, and begin a new pursuit. Although Joseph was well contented where he was, and, had never expressed a wish to. change, yet when at the expiration of many months, and with the credit of being well posted in the theory and practice of medicine, although not having attended a regular course of lectures, he heard with all the wild delight of youthful enthusiasm that he had received the appointment of medical officer in charge of the United States Steamer Mary Sanford, of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, then stationed at Charleston, S. C. The ambitious and rising 'stu- dent was now to be confined to a man-of-war, hun- dreds of miles from his native home, and amongst entire strangers, yet it was gratifying to convey with him the annexed letter: PHLADELPHA, March 11, 18--. CAPT. KEMPTON, Commanding U. S. Dispatch Steamer Mar&amp; Sanford, S. A. Blockading Squadron: Dear Sir-This will be handed you by Mr. Joseph Sharp, who has been recently appointed Medical Officer in charge of your vessel, He is well known to nme, and I entertain for hiln the kindest feelings,- as likewise does your sister and my family.   -39                  Hoping you will take him under your special care, as he is young and inexperienced in naval life, I am sir, very truly, yours, PETER TUnRNER, Commodore Ur. $. Nray. The Commodore and Captain Kempton being inti- mate' personal friends, this letter was of infinite value to Sharp, for on his, arrival in the fleet and reporting to Captain K., he received at once a very friendly greeting, assigning him quarters in his private cabin; and as is usual in such cases this marked attention on the part of the commanding officer elicited similar favors from his subordinates, so that our student was speedily at home in the novel position in which he now found himself. The Mary Sanford being a despatch steamer, and con- stantly plying from Charleston to Port Royal, St. John's, Key West, New   Orleans, and Havana, Joseph formed naturally many new acquaintances, and, through his gentlemanly deportment and close attention to duty, soon won the respect of the entire fleetpone trifling incident alone occurring to mar his satisfaction or wound his feelings whilst attached, to the vessel. Several officers had invited him to accompany them on a Sunday morning-visit to Hil- ton Head, to which' the Captain. made no objection, offering to play the part of the ship's doctor himself for the day. Sharp had not quite finished his round among the sick, when a boat was lowered alongside and announced as ready to cast off; but it appeared that Lieutenant Owens, who had been recently pro- moted and was acting officer of the day, thought I  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7753-00000021"/> 40 proper to object to the departure of the Doctor, and, ordered him to his room. His feelings were natur- ally wounded at this harsh opposition, yet he hes- itated to disobey, when casting a glance at those in the boat and recognizing the executive officer of the ship, who beckoned him to come off, he made a rapid move forward and going over the ship's side seated himself with the rest, despite the threats of the Lieutenant to have him IC court-martialed " for dis- obedience of orders. Joseph was reported to the Captain, but on' his return the representations of the chief officer and others exonerated him from blame, and the commander simply warned him to have as little as possible to do with Lieutenant Owens, who was one of those selfish tyrannical men iwho bring discredit on the service. One of the party on the above occasion was the engineer, Alvin Odell, or as he was generally termed, "Comic Joe," a sur- vivor of Kane's well-known expedition. "Joe" was' a dry genius, yet full of humor, and the life of the ship. Unfortunately, however, like too many good-natured fellows, he would put- an 'enemy in his mouth to steal away his brains," and like thou- sands of our race was amenable to the strictures of  Sir Walter Raleigh-"It were better for a man to be subject to any vice than to drunkenness; for all other vanities and sins are recovered, and it dulleth the spirits, and destroyeth the body as ivy doth the old tree; the longer it possesseth a man, the more he will delight in it, and the older he groweth the more he shall be subject to it."   -41 On this Sunday the facetious engineer indulged extensively in the vice, and having wandered into a small clump- of live oaks or hammock-as it is termed by the natives of Carolina-a few hundred yards from the beach, where, imagining he was on board, he partially disrobed and hung his garments on the branch of a tree with the impression it was the clothes-rack in his state-room, making mother earth his bed and his covering the ethereal skies. When roused out and laughed at by his friends for the mis- take he had made, Joe insisted he knew what he was about, and had been " cradled (hie) to sleep on the bil- lowy (hie) bosom of the mighty deep, and, and,"- for old Joe was grandiloquent and disdained the lan- guage of the vulgar, "the deep bosom of the mighty billows," continuing, as he straggled down to the landing, '"You see, gentlemen, the truth must be told, for it is has ever been (hie) considered of such vital im- portance, and-and such important vitality, that it was inculcated (hic) in the sayings of the Chaldeans, as a principle of the most expedient utility, and (hie) and the most useful expediency."' As the boat neared the Mary Sanford near sundown, the engineer, who had a great regard for the ship's doctor, and who had recovered, in a great degree, from the effects of his morning's libations, addressing that gentleman remarked: "I have been told, Doctor, by men of your profession, that the forcible and vehement ap- plication of any hard substance, like the hoof of a quadruped, to the tender and carniferous portions of the human frame, such as the posterior elongation, 4A  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7753-00000022"/> 42 occasions a pain, a pang, I may say of the intensest acuteness, and--and of the acutest intensity," add- ing, before the roar of laughter which greeted the observation was subdued, "Now my advice is to give that d-d Owens an application of that charac- ter, as a reward for his day's conduct, and-and for his conduct to-day." Joe was about making a smiling protest against such a breach of discipline, when a rope was thrown from the Sanford, and after the day's enjoyment the party stood once more upon her deck, and the offi- cers dispersed to their quarters. Odell dryly ob- serving, as he passed the officer of the day, "Take care you don't get sick, Lieutenant, for awhile, or the doctor may give you a heavy dose and send you to your room." Singularly enough, in a few weeks after the trip to Hilton Head, Lieutenant Owens informed the doctor he was suffering from enlarged veins of the right leg, but Sharp refused advice, unless he allowed his name to be placed on the sick list.  Owens for two or three days refused this demand of the ship's surgeon, but finally complied, and when the fact became known to the remaining officers, they unanimously requested Joseph to de- vise a plan for his removal from  the ship, and at  the request of the Captain he accordingly penned the following letter: UNITED STATES STEAMER MARY SANFORD, ) OFF CHARLESTON BAR, NOV. 10, 18-. To WM. JOHNSON, Fleet Surgeon, S. A. Blockading Squadron: Dear Sir-I would respectfully call for a medical survey upon Lieutenant John Owens, as he is unable to attend to duty owing   43 to varicose veins of right leg. According to the patient's own statement he had suffered with the same affection previous to entering the service, and is therefore not entitled to pension. I am, sir, yours truly, JOSEPH SHARP. The above was immediately despatched by Captain Kempton to the flag-ship Philadelphia, and during the afternoon of the same day an officer reported on board to relieve Mr. Owens, and brought an order which read as follows          ' Sir-You are hereby relieved from duty and will at once report on board of hospital ship John Adams, to stand a medical sur- vey.  I am, sir, yours respectfully, DAVID PORTER, Rear Admiral U. S. N. To LIEUT. JOHN OWENS, U. S. S. Mary Sanford. Mr. Owens, it may well be supposed, was greatly surprised ait the reception of this order, for he had not imagined such would be the result, and he gave utterance to bitter reproaches against the Doctor, who in reply hoped this -would teach him a lesson in the future. -There was a general rejoicing over his departure, as- he was exceedingly unpopular with officers and crew, and Joe was complimented highly for his stratagem, the engineer in his usual felicitous style remarking:   c Bless my soul, was'nt that a piece of sharp practice, and-and a sharp piece of practice?" A few weeks subsequent to the removal of Owens, the vessel was ordered to Havana, and about mid- night, when nearing Key West, a portion of the crew who had not been on shore for the past two years, resolved to take charge of the steamer by force, run her ashore and desert the service; how- &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7753-00000023"/> " ever it fortunately occurred that the tumult was heard in the darkness on board the armed ship Cher- bourg, which was not very distant, and holding the same course with the Sanford. Divining the uproar to a rise from a mutiny, the Cherbourg sent promptly a large force of men to aid the steamer, and in a few moments placed the mutineers, who composed a ma- jority of the crew, in irons. But as one misfortune is ever succeeded by another, scarcely had matters been placed in proper trim, and the excitement somewhat abated, before a new and unexpected danger threatened the gallant vessel, and this was from the guns of a heavily armed privateer, which bore down on the Mary Sanford with the compliment of a solid shot across her bows. All was confusion though not dismay on the latter vessel, as the larger portion were below, amongst whom were some ex- cellent gunners, but after their recent conduct could not be freed and intrusted with her defence. - Thus short-handed, there was no other resource for our hero and the other officers but to man the guns in haste, and beyond doubt the unequal combat would have closed in a  disaster for the stars and stripes, but providentially the shouts and yells of the muti- neers being distinctly heard on board of the enemy, impressed the wary privateersmen unacquainted with the true position of affairs with the belief that they were outnumbered, and as discretion is the better part of valor, after the interchange of a few shots, drew off and left the Sanford to pursue her course. Thus, as will be conceded, the desperate men con-   45  fined below decks unwittingly  rendered more efficient service on the steamer than they could have done if free and engaged in her defence, No further interruption occurring, on the evening of the follow- ing day they anchored under the guns of Moro Castle, in the harbor of Havana. The steamer brought as passengers from Charleston, Mr. Wm. 1-1. -- -- and his daughter Mary, of Philadelphia, be- tween the latter of whom and the youthful surgeon a slight intimacy was established during the passage, so that during the brief stay of the vessel at the -gay metropolis of Cuba, Joseph, in connection with the young lady's father, formed her constant escort in viewing the city and its notable sights, amongst which was the grave Spaniard's favorite amusement, a bull fight in the public square or plaza, and in the evening, at the Tacon theatre, witnessed for the first time the renowned Spanish fandango by natives and in national costume. During this auspicious season of enjoyment the susceptible heart of the student might doubtless have been enamored of the fair girl by whose side he was so constantly placed, had not his former unfor- tunate experience as a suitor still agitated his memory; and neither pleasure nor change, nor the indifference and unmerited insult he had received at the hands of LillieArdennc-, lad served to entirely obliterate her image from his mind, so sincere had been his youthful and hopeless passion. OUr, hero, before leaving Havana, was summoned one after- noon to attend a young man taken suddenly ill &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7753-00000024"/> on the steamer Liberty of the New York line, but before he could render assistance the sufferer had expired, of which incident our lively engineer took occasion to remark: -"He was no doubt a sensible young man, and thought he resembled the old soldier killed in action, who had no need of repent- ance, for he went so quick and got into heaven that the devil never knew he was dead." Before the return trip to Charleston, poor Odell, who was proceeding to the wharf after a night's carousal, and carrying according to custom a heavy top-hamper of Spanish brandy, got overboard in the dark, but being happily fished out in time, and asked how he relished old Neptune's soup, responded, "I've got nothing against the soup, but whoever put the salt in (hie) was not a bit stingy, and -and not stingy a bit." As the Mary Sanford steamed out of the harbor, threatening clouds obscured the sun, and off the Bahamas a hurricane struck the good ship, her rud- der-chain was broken ; she became almost unmanage- able, and was tossed at the mercy of the waves, but the young Doctor, who possessed both a cool head and intrepid heart, was perfectly collected midst the deafening blasts of wind and the mountainous bil- lows that nearly engulfed the steamer at times. Yet who ever gazed upon the broad sea without emotion, whether viewed from the deck of a tempest- tossed bark in stern majesty dashing  its waves with resistless fury, or to behold it beneath the silver moon, its broad bosom broken only by a gentle                    .   47  ripple, or again standing on some promontory, whence the eye roams far out over its glassy surface, basking beneath the midday sun, do we not invol- untarily conceive a nobler idea of the majesty of that God, that true and ever living God who hold- eth "':the waters in the hollow of his hand," and verily, whilst the night breeze moaning by, soothes the watchful helmsman with gentle sounds, still the tempest, shrieking and groaning among the cordage, turns him pale with anticipation of a watery grave. 'Several months elapsed after the return voyage of the Sanford just described, and with but little of interest to disturb their monotony, when the ship was ordered out of commission and immediately dispatched North. As she was rounding Hatteras, of which the seamen have a saying, "If the Cape of Good Hope leaves you by, at Cape Hatteras you are sure to die."  One of the crew, Charles Baker, of Philadelphia, fell overboard, and in the darkness was soon lost to sight, but on lowering a boat and search being made, he was discovered and brought safely on board. In due season entering the Dela- ware and leaving Newcastle behind them, it was not long ere the city of Philadelphia, wrapt in the gray mist of morning, appeared in sight, and the Mary Sanford, after a long and eventful absence, cast anchor off the Navy Yard, and our hero had leave to return to his native village, being no longer in the government employ. It could not be other- wise than with strangely mingled sensations of joy &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7753-00000025"/> and sorrow that Joseph Sharp now made prepara- tions for his return home. Joy at the retrospect of the honorable and interesting career he had so re- cently led, and sorrow at the contemplation of the uncertain -future and the inevitable enmity which a portion of his old- neighbors were sure to have in store for him. The morning journals duly chroni- cled the arrival of the dispatch steamer Mary San- ford, South Atlantic Squadron, Captain Kempton, and the full list of officers' names, amongst which appeared Surgeon Joseph Sharp, Churchville, Md., and a crew of one hundred and thirty-five men ; and previous to leaving the ship, Joe was the recipient at the hands of the officers of a beautiful gold-headed cane, as a compliment for his kind attention to them,    CHAPTER V. Yet we find midst the gloom that our pathway o'ershaded, A few spots of sunshine, and flowers unfaded." ONCE more beneath the old familiar roof-tree, the relatives of Joseph, over- joyed after his long absence to have him  once more home, in their kindly welcome, fully atoned to his wounded feelings for the sneers and scowls of others, which now as of old, were freely showered upon him. He was informed that during the past year Robert Dull had devoted his time to the study of ,hedicine, and had attended a course of lectures at the University of Maryland, also, that he was now home for a brief season, designing shortly to return to the college. Shortly after his arrival, Joe accidentally encountered Dull at the village store, and the bystanders, anxious for a jest at the expense of the farmer's son, audibly insinuated he had better study and attend college the coming session, as Bob Dull would be there and could assist him. The latter, with a toss of the head, responded to the hint by saying: "Robert Dull, gentlemen, &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7753-00000026"/> never makes a practice of assisting or associating with a plebeian fool." Though the insult was a gross one, Joe commanded his temper, making the simple reply:  "Well, sir, as you were never able to assist any one at the academy, should I attend the college, I should never look for information fronm you." The propriety of the answer was conceded by all, and evoked applause which so enraged Dull that he bit his lips in silence, being unable to find words to express himself; and' he now not only hated but feared the talented youth who had so recently discharged the duties of an arduous position with credit, for he apprehended he might enter the uni- versity with himself at the approaching term, and the apprehension proved correct. o The reader may be surprised that Joe, who was young, impetuous and ardent, should for so long a time and so meekly have borne the contumely and the unprovoked sneers of the banker's son, a discreditable course, which appeared with lapse of years to increase in bitter- ness. True, he would have been amply justified in retorting as follows "And what are you, Robert Dull, that you should lord it over me? areyo r imbsstronger? your muscles firmer? your propor- tions juster? and if you disclaim physical compari- sons, are your metial faculties of a higher order? are the treasures of science more expanded to your view than to mine, or are you lord of the thunder- bolts of eloquence? have you wit to illuine or judgment to combine, or energy to control? or are you not what in reality you appear, overbearing ye   impotent-tyrannical, yet ridiculous? Go! -grind your minions into the earth, what care I for your weak and frivolous despotism; true, you are rich, and I am the child of poverty, yet God made me your equal, and it -shall go hard but I will prove your superior." Such would have been the merited reproof to insolent assumption. But our hero, as we have elsewhere observed, had no ordinary mind; remarkable self-possession was one of his leading attributes, and disdaining the weakness of his adver- sary, pity, more than anger, controlled his action when brought in contact with the upstart, and he felt that " they who forgive most, shall be most forgiven." The commencement of the winter term, the 3rd of October, having arrived, large numbers of students from the various States of the Union appeared within the wails of the University of Maryland, pro- ceeding at once to the " green room " to settle their matriculation fee. Robert Dull, who was one of the number, was observed to suddenly change counte- nance when a familiar voice behind him was heard to say in answer to one of the Professors, "( My name sir, is Joseph Sharp, of Churchville, iMd. The haughty young man turned pale with rage, and permitting his hatred to supersede his limited amount of judgment, he turned quickly round, ex- claiming : "Professor, do you intend to receive that base fellow's application and place it on the same list with mine?"This unexpected and unusual inci- dent startled both faculty and students, and all &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7753-00000027"/> 52 eyes were instantly fastened on the Harford county rivals. The Dean of the faculty demanded of Robert to state his objection to the young man, but before the demand could be complied with, two of the witnesses to the scene who were well -acquainted with both parties, responded: ," There was no objec. tion whatever to Mr. Sharp ; he was a gentleman in every respect, his parents and relatives were well known in their neighborhood, and that this attack upon him was caused through the promptings of jealousy and ancient feelings of enmity." This emphatic declaration disconcerted Robert Dull, and greatly pleased Joe, and had propriety permitted he would have warmly embraced his generous advo- cates. In the meanwhile the Dean, who was satisfied of the general accuracy of the statement just made, delivered a severe reprimand to Dull for the disturb- ance he had caused, and his unfriendly assault upon the reputation of a fellow student. The animosity of years was largely enhanced by the termination of this opening scene at College, and its immediate effect was to produce a division of sentiment amongst the body of students, a portion of whom ardently espoused the cause of the farmer's son, whilst others, dazzled by his wealth and social posi- tion, rallied to the standard of the aristocratic youth, shrewdly foreseeing that they could turn his lavish command of means to the promotion of their own ends during the winter's residence in Baltimore they were about to enjoy. It is generally contended, and with much show of 1   53                : truth, that medical students as a body are among- the most arrant scapegraces in the community. After leading a reckless academical career for a term of years, rooming together and constantly plotting mischief, they are congregated suddenly in vast numbers amidst the innumerable temptations of our larger cities, making midnight excursions to lonely cemeteries, dealing with and dissecting the poor remains of humanity, and ever becoming hardened to thie most ghastly and revolting scenes, can it be otherwise than that they should for a brief season be devoid of those more refined sentiments which in after life characterize very many noble ornaments to the profession? Nothing is more natural for a student than to adopt the minor vices of smoking and chewing, and too frequently the far greater one of drinking. Usually divided into small parties, they cling to the members of their own clique with the tenacity of sincere friendship, and many times as they- are known to be at variance with rival cliques, yet they seldom or never degenerate' into open rupture, but if one of their number should get into trouble outside of the college, one and all will defend him to the last, and should he be in any manner injured, will secure revenge whether right or wrong. Many may imagine that the student of medicine, accustomed to frolics and loose behavior, would impair in a measure the noble faculties con- ferred upon him by an all-wise Providence, yet we have seldom to record a fact of this character amongst the many thousands who have rendered these studies 5* &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7753-00000028"/> 54  their pursuit, and particularly as regards the faculty of retaining the subject-matter of the lectures deliv- ered during a session, and upon which they are sub- ject to be examined in an abrupt and unexpected manner at any moment during their college career. Being unprovided with books, and left with no de- fence beyond a retentive memory, it will be 'perceived at once how important is an unimpaired one to the disciple of Galen ; and it may not be amiss to subjoin a brief commentary on memory in general, as it is one of the proudest'attributes of manhood and justly called the "Mother of the Muses." This faculty is subject to be impaired by various physical and men- tal causes, while a similar agency can sometimes restore it to its pristine energies, cr develop its powers:when sluggish and defective. Memory may be termed as the history of the past chronicled in our minds, to be consulted and called upon when- ever circumstances or strange complications of human interest demand its powerful aid. Memory has been divided into that faculty that applies to facts, and to that mere superficial quality that embraces a re- collection of things, to which must be added the memory of localities. According to the doctrine of Aristotle, reminiscence is the power of recollecting an object by means of a syllogistic chain of thought, an intellectual link with which animals do not seem to be gifted. The remembrance of things or facts can alone bring forth sound judgment. It implies a regular co-ordination of ideas, in which circum- stances are linked with each other.  The chain   55  broken, no conclusion can be drawn. The reason why the society of the learned is seldom entertaining to others, is founded on this, for they are considered absent, while in truth their brain is busily employed in pursuits perhaps of great magnitude, and must therefore be anything but agreeable to those who generally think through the medium of other per- so0n's brains. Upon memory, as we have said, depends the student's success in a medical college, and assuredly time will never erase the recollection of those intro- ductory scenes, the dissecting-room and the mid- night raid upon the homes of the dead, when he stands as it were a living, trembling monument, a landmark dividing the timid youth of the past from the learned doctor of the future. Both Sharp and Dull had  successfully surmounted these trying ordeals, and the innate characteristics of each are now to be developed  The latter, bountifully sup- plied with means, and with little inclination for study, we may conjecture found a prolific field in the questionable attractions of fashionable life for a lavish expenditure of the banker's wealth; whilst the former, studious as we have discovered hereto- fore, and enjoying a limited allowance, scarcely sufficient to meet his absolute expenses, from the humble income at his father's disposal, applied him- self with redoubled energy to the acquisition of a thorough knowledge of the important profession he had adopted. The rival students saw but little of each other,   &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7753-00000029"/> 56 and then only when in attendance upon lectures. At the close of one of these, after several months had passed without incident, Joseph overheard a remark, more than usually derogatory, regarding his character, addressed by Dull to a student of the name of Sidney. The pertinacity of his' caluminous reports had at length aroused the forgiving nature of our hero, who was convinced that " forbearance had ceased to become a virtue," and hence, with the impulse of an indignation that could no longer be suppressed, he stepped forward and seizing Robert Dull by the collar, demanded his meaning. The proud young man, highly incensed, and feeling his dignity impaired in an unwonted degree, exclaimed, stepping slightly back: "You cowardly puppy! Meet me as a gentleman in the field and I will maintain my meaning." "Where you will, sir, and when- you will," re- sponded Joseph, and with a contemptuous glance, turned and left the hall. He was immediately joined on the way to his lodgings by an intimate and tried friend, Percival Norris, who had been one of the companions of his early childhood, who re- marked, on reaching the house where they mutually sojourned in town :             f "CJoe, I do not regret this, -although -you may regard it as unfortunate. I have no apprehension of a fatal result, and its effect will be to warn a malignant enemy that even the tongue of slander must have a termination." "For -myself I have neither regrets nor appre-   57             t s; hensions, believe me, old friend," said the student, with a smile, "beyond the sure disapproval of the faculty, and possibly the disgrace of expulsion." "We will not discuss that in advance," rejoined his friend ; "but as we anticipate a speedy visit from Dull's representative, let us make arrangements at once for the meeting, unless you have another friend that you prefer to myself." "I certainly have not," was the answer, "and shall ever be indebted for your assistance in this affair." In an hour's time Mr. Frank Sidney, acting for the banker's heir, announced himself, and sending up his card desired an interview with Mr. Sharp. On entering the apartment that gentleman, after ascertaining the object of his visit, courteously re- ferred him to his friend) Mr. Norris, and the prelim- inaries were speedily arranged, the hour of six the following morning being agreed upon, and the place a secluded grove four miles from the city; the weapons to be used, the customary dueling pistols. It is hardly requisite to assure the reader that our hero, in common with all Christian gentlemen, ab- horred the absurd and, so-called "Code of honor," so firequently resorted to on the part of young men, and firmly adhered to the principles that life is the gift of God, and it was never bestowed to be sported with, and that to be the participant in a hostile en- counter of this nature, rendered both challenger and challenged alike amenable to the severest censure; but let the consequence be what itmight, it was   &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7753-00000030"/> 58 now too late to retract. As the theme is an unpleas- ant one, we shall briefly dismiss it, and simply inform the reader that the hostile parties appeared promptly on the ground at. the hour appointed. Robert Dull was evidently uneasy, displaying con- siderable tremor when Sidney having loaded the weapons placed one within his hand and after a brief pause gave the order to fire. The shot went by the person of his antagonist, leaving him un- harmed. Sharp, who had determined to have no blood upon his hands, at the same instant raising the pistol discharged it in the air, when Dull, with- out however thanking his'opponent for this act of magnanimity, yet doubtless well pleased to termi- nate the meeting, declared his honor satisfied, and by different routes the principals and their seconds returned at once to town, with the view of prevent- ing their absence being noted at college. Thus the affair was kept an entire secret from the Dean and Faculty, otherwise it would, beyond question, have resulted in the expulsion of all engaged in it. The remainder of the winter passed away without any special features to relieve the monotony of a stu- dent's life, beyond an occasional mischievous freak, which the reckless ones of the gentry were prone to indulge in when occasion offered, such as capturing an unlucky African of a dark evening, rushing him up to the dissecting room, brandishing their knives above him, and producing an agony of terror that left the trembling individual scarcely the power to escape, when the order was given to leave. At   59  . other times, when the snow lay deeply in the college yard, impromptu battles would be inaugurated, during which the balls would fly so thickly through the air that the spectators who were attracted thereby, police as well as others, would be compelled to beat a hasty retreat.  There are follies as catching as contagious disor- ders, and thus even our hero who, as a rule, main- tained a very staid deportment, would at rare intervals be seduced into minglingwlith his fellow- students in those seasons of relaxation and social enjoyment, although, as his means would not per- mit, he was seldom to be found of an evening with the more advanced students indulging the luxury of a box at the opera house or theatre, and as there was much at times of an objectionable nature to be witnessed at these places, quite at variance with the steady principles in which Joseph had been indoc- trinated from childhood, he had but small relish for an imperfect enjoyment which, is attended with regret, a surfeit of pleasure that brings disgust, and preferred seeking for some useful employment, which Galen calls "' nature's physician," so essen- tial is it to human happiness. Both the tastes and habits of Robert Dull being essentially different, and liberally supplied, as we have stated, with an indulgent father's means, it was not surprising that gay saloons and scenes of festivity were graced with that gentleman's presence night after night, nor that his private box at Ford's was frequently shared by some favorite demoiselle whose artificial graces were far in excess of native modesty.   &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7753-00000031"/> 60 Miss Lena Frazier, who on occasions figured as a member of the corp de ballet, had succeeded in caus- ing extensive inroads upon the affections and the national currency of the banker's hopeful offspring, and in the short period of a winter's flirtation had become sufficiently interested in his movements as to keep a jealous eye upon the advent of any rival that might arise to lessen her claims, and did not hesitate to exact promises of unchanging fidelity from the susceptible Robert, whose response would generally amount to this "Pour V'aour de ieu.  "Do not, my charming Lena, ask such questions. Are you not aware my admiration, like a bird, is  chained here and cannot fly away." This tempora- ry amende Aonorable, however, would not prevent an occasional imperious call at the lodgings of the recreant student, whenever a  broken engagement would ruffle the calm sea of Lena's affections, and these visits, which were usually performed in a   showy equipage on the part of the fascinating actress, became   of too great notoriety to be overlooked, and the landlady was constrained to request a ces- sation of them, the alternative being other quarters if not complied with. A  change would have been of disadvantage to Dull, as his intimate associates, upon one or two of whom he largely depended for assistance in his studies, had rooms at the house, and he did not desire a  separation from them, and  he was therefore forced as pleasantly as possible to ask the actress not to repeat her calls. Lena was  not only a   pretty but sagacious woman, and had     .             .!   " been too long an observer of man's insincerity to be deceived, or fail to realize the waning influence of her charms over the fickle student's heart, and although greatly incensed--As what discarded woman would' not be--she wisely concluded that to dissemble was her true policy, and by so acting probably realize the common belief that the end of love is the begin- ning of friendship, yet she determined in a suitable and truly melo-dramatic manner to wreak ven- geance, not upon the lover, but the one to whom that lover's heart was given, and the sequel will portray the mode in which that object was accomplished, at least in the estimation of the misguided woman her- self. A few days subsequent to this difference with the fair Lena, Robert was handed the annexed note: MR. ROBERT DULL: Dear Friend-Can you make it convenient to call this evening at my aunt's, No. - Hamilton Terrace, and oblige Yours,      LTTT,TTIE A. The student was somewhat surprised, never having been honored with a line from Miss Ardenne, nor being aware of her presence in town, and in truth Dull was secretly pleased at the opportunity afforded of prejudicing the mind of the writer against his hated competitor, having been led to suppose that a warmer sentiment than friendship existed between Lillie and the farmer's son. Hience it was with anticipations of pleasure that on the evening in ques- tion, hle greeted the daughter of Judge A. and ex- pressed his desire that her sojourn in Baltimore would be an agreeable one.  After a number of  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7753-00000032"/> 62 inquiries regarding his college friends, the name of Mr. Sharp was mentioned, and the vindictive young  man, although so recently indebted to that gentle- man for his life, scrupled not to disparage his abili- ties and his creditable course at the University, con- cluding with the prediction that he would not pass an  examination, but that he himself expected to graduate the following month, and begged her to accept a ticket for herself and friends on the occasion. The fair girl who was aware of the hostile relations existing between her, visitor and her former admirer, gave. but little credence to the voluble declamation against the latter with which she was indulged,  yet courtesy would not permit her to exhibit disbe-   lief, and so the evening passed with the customary  1! amount of gossip and unmeaning compliment, and    l on taking leave she accepted the vain-glorious stu- dent's invitation to promenade the succeeding after- noon. Dull kept his appointment in Hamilton Terrace with unwonted punctuality, and being introduced to Miss Ada Morton and Mr. Tom Mer- edith, friends of Miss Ardenne, the party strolled leisurely amidst a smiling throng of fair belles and gallant beaux along the fashionable promenades with which the City of Monuments abound. What gay ideas crowd the vacant brain When peers, and dukes, and all their sweeping train, :ai Garters and stars and coronets appear, And in soft sounds "Your grace " salutes the ear!  r Now, "Your grace," 'tis true, did not salute the ear, nor the stars and brilliant coronets, so custom-   63           - ary in Hyde Park or Regent street, dazzle the view of our fair friends on the present occasion, yet we doubt if the combined nobility of Great Britain would have created a tithe of the interest or amaze- nient which the sudden debut on the Charles street stage of Miss Lena Frazier produced at this moment. The  little actress, without word or warning, sprang like an avenging Nemesis at the person of Miss Ar- denne, rending her dress, disordering her beautiful tresses, marring her countenance, and, causing her costly hat, worn for the first time, to roll inglo- riously across the crowded sidewalk. Lilhe had only time to utter an involuntary shriek when she swooned away. Dull was speechless and too irres- olute to render assistance for a moment, whilst Lena, with the brief exclamation," Iamsatisfied tmure and disappeared amongst a gaping crowd of aston- ished beholders. It was some moments after being conveyed into a neighboring druggists ere the as- tounded young lady was sufficiently recovered to be assisted into a carriage ordered for her use, and was then driven rapidly home, the oier of Mr. Dull to accompany her being firmly and disdainfully refused, as She remembered his name being- pronounced by the infuriated actress at the moment of the asault, and inferred very justly that he was a slight if not an intimate acquaintance of her assailant From this unpleasant occurrence Lillie Ardenne was confined for several days to the house her parents in the meantime, having been apprised by telegraph, arrived in the city and wer greatly dis-   &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7753-00000033"/> " tressed, both at the condition in which they found their only child, and at the disgrace apprehended from the publicity of the affair. Mr Dull having called to inquire after, and if possible, to exculpate himself from censure, was politely informed that his absence was desired. Judge .Ardenne having ascertained herl addreds, called upon the actress, who received him courteously and gave him a candid history ofF- lacy  with the student, and apol- ogized for any trouble she may have entailed upon his family. The father was naturally reluctant that the courts should take cognizance of the affair, and departed with- the promise of overlooking her con- duct; and meeting Robert Dull accidentally the following morning, forbade him positively visiting his daughter or any of the family. The proud young man was exceedingly mortified at the inter- dict thus placed upon him, and equally chagrined that the knowledge of his disgrace could not be concealed from Sharp, whose usual magnanimity would not however permit him to notice the humnil- iation even of one who had sought to injure him so grossly, The haughty but now greatly humiliated Lillie, after returning to her country home, did not for' several months entirely recover from the effects of her sad discomfiture in Baltimore, consequently did not attend the medical commencement to which Mr. - Dull had so blandly invited her, with the fond ex-  pectation of receiving at her hands a princely bouquet or other token of her approval.,   65 - The period fixed for the final examination had now arrived, and among the candidates for gradua- tion was the name of Robert Dull, and so sure was le of his ability to pass, that he - transmitted quite freely his tickets of invitation with the annexed en- dorsement, together with his monogram, "  Compli- ments*of Robert Dull, M. D."   At the conclusion of the fiery ordeal, a vote was taken by the Profes- sors as to the worthiness of the contestants to merit the degree of doctor of medicine, and^ the students being assembled in one of the lecture-rooms, notices to each of the successful students, placed in neat en- velopes, were despatched to them through the hands of the janitor. The customary nervous excitement was visible in the deportment of the assembled crowd. A  number of successful candidates were announced, and at length the name of Robert Dull being called, the notice addressed that gentleman was found to contain the following: \ Sir-I regret to inform you that your examination has not been satisfactory. I am, sir, yours respectfully, ----- -----. , Dean. To MR. ROBERT DULL. The crest-fallen banker's son, amidst exclamations of"Oh  oh! Dull has gone up!" immediately left the college,/too much mortified to be interviewed by any one, and proceeding to his boarding house, although the hour was 10 P. M., packed his trunk and took the cars for home, arriving at one in the morning, although he was obliged to walk five miles 6* &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7753-00000034"/> I.6 of the journey. His disappointment, it may readily be conjectured, was keen; but after passing some  weeks at home, he returned to the city and entered a private office as a student, replying to inquiries  regarding his late examination, that he had changed his mind and determined to take three courses. Meanwhile- young Sharp remained in Baltimore  studying laboriously and assisting in the office of Professor S. The following autumn the rivals again entered college under far different circumstances from those attending their previous course, for owing to Robert's, multiplicity of troubles, and his failure during the past winter, he was now  constrained, however- unwillingly, to observe a respectful silence both in relation to the abilities and standing of his ancient enemy. And now, gentle reader, we shall beg your indulgence to close the present season's career'of the students with the simple announcement that each successfully passed the ultimate examination, and were-rewarded with the long sought diplomas.    'Tis not the richest plant that folds The sweetest breath of fragrance in. T would be by no means difficult for     , the most obtuse intellect to foresee that the prodigal habits, in addition to the       i IT would be by no means difficult for the most obtuse intellect to foresee that the prodigal habits, in addition to the ai rogant nature of Doctor Dull, but ill- suited the trying and arduous profession upon which he was now about to enter, and the reader, who has marked his career to the present juncture, will read- ily perceive that his innate qualities possessed little in common with those truly noble characteristics eloquently portrayed by the eminent practitioner, Dr. Francis, in speaking of the physi- cian's duty and responsibility: "Who that has kept vigils at the couch of genius, and marked the wayward flickerings of its sacred fire made yet more ethereal by disease, or seen beauty grow almost supernatural in the embrace of pain, has not felt his mission to be holy as well as responsible? Let not that be thought a light office which summons us to minister. as apostles of science, to the greatest 67&#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7753-00000035"/> 68. exigencies of life; to alleviate the decay of nature; to watch over the glimmering dawn and the fading tw:light of existence. What a mastery of self, what requisites, mental and corporeal, are demanded in him who is the observer of scenes like these." Devoid of the talent and amenity of manner, which can alone secure popularity in those who would be otherwise utterly repulsive, Dull could expect but little encouragement from a discerning community; and when after renting an office in a f:tsionable locality at six hundred per annum, gorgeously fur- nishing the same, and procuring a costly carriage and pair of blooded nags, together with a liveried driver, he sat complacently down to await patronage, or varied the morning's monotony, as he usually did, by giving a drive to his fashionable acquaintance through the avenues and parks, we may not be amiss in conjecturing that the citizens of Baltimore, renowned as they are for a genial and hospitable rep- utation, looked with an unfavorable eye upon the advent of this Harford county luminary. Again, the practice which time might possibly have brought  him, became "small by degrees and beautifully less," when pressing day-calls were postponed for hours, under the doctor's sapient conclusion that it would not answer to be prompt, less the family or their neighbors should conclude that his practice was too limited to delay him elsewhere; and mid- night calls were treated still more cavalierly, by reason of the doctor's customary response that he would call at 10 A. M., as he was suffering with a,   -        -   A?!- cold and so forth. The result of this trifling was, that when the visit was effected another physician had been summoned to meet the exigency, and our fashionable M. D., after making some irritable com- ments in relation to the case, was-politely informed- that his professional services would in future be dispensed with. Directly in contrast with the foregoing was the action of Dr. Sharp at this period of our history. He also located in the City of Monuments, but his slender means would permit only of an obscure office at twelve dollars per month, and as he possessed neither team nor the wherewith to procure ode, and depended solely upon his practice for a living, his prospects at the outset were by no means flattering; but the disadvantages under which he labored were compensated by a stout heart and never-failing flow of spirits, that would not admit of viewing the dark side of the picture. The initial case in his chosen avo' ation was that of a lad whose hand was badly cut, which our hero promptly and regularly attended until recovery. Through his gentle, obliging dis- position, and readiness to respond night or day to-  every summons, he speedily acquired an income sufficient to meet his humble expenses, yet, as all new beginners may expect, he was sorely tried at times. Here we may as. a pertinent theme properly ask the indulgence of a brief digression. . One of the greatest trials of the young physician-and no one but he who has tried its realities can tell the fearful responsibility attending it-is to form a cor-   &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7753-00000036"/> 70 rect diagnosis, and it is only after hle has been called to see a patient that he is made conscious of its supreme importance. - Should the young practi- tioner -form a false diagnosis of any disease that he may be called to attend, his mode of treatment would only have a tendency te yo aggravate and 1p- mote the diseased process going on in the differ-- ent organs, either the solids or fluids. Not only would an error in forming a diagnosis aggravate the -disease, but such a gross error might be the cause of his total ruin should it become known in his community, and even if it did not involve his ruin, it would take years to regain his reputation. This, then, shows the vital importance of being slow in judgment, and sure in every step towards form- ing a correct diagnosis, as upon it rests not only his reputation, but the life or death of the patient de- pends upon his accuracy. Therefore should he en- deavor to keep pace with- the progress of medical science in its constant advancement, revealing new methods of treatment and bringing him into closer relations with physical science It becomes an absolute and indispensable study for every one who wishes -to attain success in his profession, and Ineet all its requisite demands at the proper time, watch- ing every symptom to see that it bears testimony to the fact that he has in no instance violated his own diagnosis of the disease, and that he has not estab- lished a system of treatment based upon principles of erroneous and unfounded character. Having force and phenomena to deal with, con-   71 ' l sequently he should become familiar with them, at least so far as they relate to his practice.  He should be enabled to interpret all the symptoms manifested from time to time, and turn them to a correct diagnosis, which subject thus embraces more aspects than one ; it presents him not only with re- liable and just ideas of forming the same, of treat- ment for many nervous derangements and diseases, but it affords an instructive phase of nature in growth, waste and repair, in cause and cure, thus throwing light on the whole range of the healing art. But care and practical attention should attend his every step, as a young beginner, in this inter- esting department of medical science. For no con- clusion has ever stood the test of time or gained general consent with the intelligent, that is not strictly in harmony with the laws of nature and the moral laws of God.  When through disease, organs become the seat of foreign matter,. which prevent them from performing their special functions, it is through the judicious treatment of the physician that they become assimilated to healthy tissue, or are properly expelled from the body, by prescribing the appropriate medicine required in special and in general treatment, to allay or arrest the morbid process of the disease, and restore it to the healthy condition of its normal state. It is his duty to study the action of the various forms of disease; the methods of the administration and application of drugs, in order to apply them at the proper time and to the appropriate diseases, that he may acquire  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7753-00000037"/> a correct knowledge of the philosophy of life the laws of disease, and the catastrophe of death. It is important,. then, that he become familiar with the different diseases as manifested by the disturbance of nature, together with the general and the specific laws that regulate the given transmission of those diseased agents through the different living tissues. All this must be studied with the fullest sense of their importance in two relations; first, as they relate to his future reputation; secondly, with a view to the advancement of the healing art of medical science, and the immediate relief of a no small class of afflicted persons, and at the same time constantly keep in mind the great difference in human nature;  the habits of the patient, his mental faculty, and his constitutional powers, his hereditary affections, and whatever deformities may occur either physi- cally or mentally. Let us now return, to our youthful M. D. A number of physicians, victims of an unworthy jeal- ousy, not uncommon in the profession, spoke ill of Dr. Sharp, as they gradually began to hear liberal praises bestowed upon the rising young man, and were apprehensive he might lessen their practice. This greatly annoyed and wounded the feelings of the obnoxious new comer, as he had determined to act honorable to all, and expected the hand of fel- lowship in return. It is discreditable to many of our senior M. D's, that they make it a rule in many cases to speak in derogatory terms of younger members of the pro-   fession, frequently entering upon the subject with such remarks as, "Weil, I cannot understand how such and such a stupid fellow ever got a diploma ;" or if they know of a special case under treatment, "Well, let him go ahead; he will soon finish him or her-soon kill them," or something to that effect. Not honoring the humble aspirant to medical fame witlh the title of AI. D., but they are always " inex- perienced fellows." If called in for consultation, and are informed by a member of the family the name of the complaint as pronounced by the younger physician, they will shake their heads with the gravity of a Chinese mandarin and exclaim, "Is it possible? Why it is all wrong--it is a different dis- easealtogether. Show me the medicine prescribed."' A glance, a smell, a long breath, and then it's "my God, its a wonder the patient is not dead before this. Throw this stuff away, bottle and all!" Perhaps he may advise discharging the doctor; if not, and he deigns to consult with his junior, he will detain him for an hour with a multitude of irascible questions and disagreements, and after finding the young man better posted than himself, like the faamed doctor in Moliere's comedy, when the people of the household were doing what they could for the sick man, and the, malady was press- ing, would not recede from his opinion, the poor fellow dying bravely during the dispute exclaimed, "Undoubtedly, the formalities must be guarded, whatever happens, a man dead is only a dead man, and that is of little consequence; but a formality :7 &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7753-00000038"/> 74- neglected brings great prejudice upon the whole body of physicians i"  At least he will never agree with the stupid fellow as he loves to term him, and will probably end the dispute by advising a further consultation with either the gray-haired Professor Cureall or Killnone, as the name of some distinguished friend may happen to suggest itself. Had our hero been blessed with wealth and a circle of influential friends, annoyances of the character narrated would have been of less frequent occurrence, but his good nature would have philosophically sub- mitted to the petty affronts and sneers of his elder brethren, had his exertions been crowned with a more permanent income, but in this period of his medical career, he was often oppressed with serious misgivings, and endured many sleepless nights, in contemplating the mode by which his incumbent expenses were to be met, being often without a dol- lar or a friend from whom he could request a loan. His, faith, however, in a beneficent Creator remained unshaken, and that faith, as ever will be the case, was shortly destined to be rewarded; for, after hav- ing his path long darkened with the sombre clouds of adversity, he was accidentally and very fortu- nately introduced to a physician of long standing and ample fortune, who had himself in former days met similar obstacles to those which now beset the - career of Doctor Sharp, but successfully triumphing over the rebuffs--' The slings and arrows of outraged fortune," as the dramatist terms them-he was now in the erljoyment of a large and lucrative practice.   75 This tried and -true friend, whom we shall name Doctor Ambro, having extended the hand of fellow- ship to Joseph, befriended him ever afterwards in all his troubles, assisting him when he required a consulting physician, often calling upon him to assist him in his own practice, or to attend to it when sick or absent from the:city, thus rendering the young beginner invaluable service in establish- ing a name and building up a practice. His new found friend would ever listen with kindly interest to his statements of trials and temptations, for he had the grace of kind listening, as well as that of kind speaking; and the reader will indulge us a moment, while we observe there is a significant value in this. Some men listen with an abstracted air, which shows that their thoughts are elsewhere. Some listen with a kind of importunate ferocity, which makes you feel that you are being put upon your trial, and that your auditor expects beforehand that you are going to tell him -a lie, or to be inaccu- rate, or to say something which he will disapprove, and that you must mind your expressions. Some interrupt and will not hear you to the end. Some, meaning to be kind, listen with such determined, lively, violent attention, that you are at once made uncomfortable, and the charm of conversation is at an end., Many persons whose manners will stand the test of speaking, break down under the trial of listening. Kind listening is often an act of the most delicate interior mortification, and may be consid- ered an unerring sign of an innate politeness ,',   '  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7753-00000039"/> 76 Doctor Sharp, having after many weary months succeeded at length in securing a little practice, and the reputation of a good physician, was attracted one morning by a notice among the foreign news of the day, that war on a gigantic scale had broken out in Europe, and that surgeons were wanted for the German army. Here was a field for ambition, and the acquirement of a vast additional knowledge and practical experience, and having a knowledge of the German language he determined at once to apply for an  appointment; he did so, was accepted, and  making immediate arrangements to leave for his new post of duty, and proceeding to New York, sailed hence for Europe, arriving at Moville, Ireland, and   crossing to Glasgow, traveled  thence to Edin- burgh, from   which place he wrote home as follows: EDINBURGH, July, 18-. Dear --.-I will now give you a few outlines of Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, one of the most imposing and interesting cities of Europe. It has a population of 170,000 souls; will well repay a lengthy visit, and ought not by any means to be passed by without stopping. My time does not permit a detailed ac- count of its interesting sights. It may not be amiss to call atten- tion to Edinburgh Castle, a queer old building, of somewhat doubtful origin, picturesquely located, and full of interest. We also visited Burn's and Walter Scott's monuments, and Holyrood House, considered by many the most interesting building in Scotland. It is well worth a visit, and one of the greatest pleas- ures I  ever enjoyed was to visit the Castle, wherein Mary, Queen of Scots, was confined and died-a nation's martyr; though she was doubted by many to be free from murder, yet as she was confined and died at the hands of her treacherous sister, Eliza- beth, her incarceration is interesting to every Christian. We next visited Melrose Abbey, Abbottsford, the residence of Sir Walter Scott, and Dryburg Abbey, his place of burial. Having   satisfied our curiosity regarding Edinburgh, and with a few hours spare time, we took a short trip to Linlithgow, ran rapidly through the fertile district of the Lothians, soon reaching our destination, with its grand buildings and palace of which the poet says: "Of all the. palaces so fair Built for the royal dwelling, In Scotland, far beyond compare Linlithgow is excelling." We then visited Stirling, about thirty-five miles west of Edin- burgh, and celebrated for its Castle, once a residence of Scotland's kings. Having spent three hours in sight seeing, we returned to Edinburgh, and thence to Leith, visiting its various places of interest, and left in the steamship Holyrood for Antwerp, by the way of Scarborough and Middlebrue (small seaports on the coast of England), hence to Flushing and Middleburg in Belgium, and then on to Antwerp. I shall now cease, stating that so far we have traveled over six thousand- miles, traversing Ireland, Scot- land, England, Belgium, Hollapd, Prussia and France. My next shall be a trip through Germany. Yours respectfully, JOSEPH SHARP-, Assistant Surgeon, 8th Corps, Prussian Army. P. S.-These lines are dated Edinburgh, but are closed at Saarlouis, Germany, our present station. At Coblenz on the Rhine, Dr. Sharp found sev- eral other American surgeons, who had left their native homes to join the German service, and who had been a number of days in the city, but were unable to secure the promised appointments, although they had certificates of acceptance from the consul general and the medical board who examined them, yet with these credentials the surgeon general would not allow a single American surgeon    to enter upon his duties. ; V  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7753-00000040"/> 78  Week after week passed by, and poverty began to stare them in the face, for they had made no pro- vision for an emergency of this nature, being connfi- dent of their acceptance they had provided only for the expenses of the voyage. After applying -in many different quarters but all in vain, our hero- wrote to the consul general at New York, who had given himself and friends the certificate which enti- tied them  to the appointment of assistant surgeons, narrating their refusal, and the unpleasant position in which they were placed. To this letter the fol- lowing emphatic answer was speedily transmitted: NEW  YORK, December 21, 18-. CONSULATE GENERAL, NORTH GERMAN UNION. Dear Sir--Your letter dated St. Johann, Nov. 28, has come to hand. It recites a story which for two months I had the pain repeatedly to hear. I regret extremely the vexations which you have experienced, especially on the part of men of your own profession in "the German service, from whom I little expected that they would receive in so unfriendly a manner enthusiastic young men who had come a long distance to share their patriotic labors, and who could show certificates from a German rep- resentative, bearing reference expressly to the highest govern- mental authority. It is an insult to me and to my chief for these army surgeons to thrust aside such certificates without making inquiry at the government as to the meaning of such paper, which seems to have taken them aback. I   have felt it so, and I  can tell you now, that Count Bismarck likewise feels indignant about it, and has ordered full satisfaction to be given you. I could not have the pleasure of seeing all of the medical gen- tlemen who passed through my office. To those whom I  have spoken I    have fully explained their position as well as my rela- tion to this matter. But I am satisfied that the gentlemen com- posing the medical board of the executive committee of the German Patriotic Aid Society, who examined you and accepted and sent you out, as well as vice-consul, Dr. Stamnian, who at   the consulate general's had charge of this affair, left no uncer- thtinty in your minds in regard to it. You must have known that it was the Aid Society, and not the consulate that sent you Pout. The consulate was Inerely instrumental in forwarding you at the expense of said society and in giving you directions. Be- fore that the consulate had, at the instance of said society, ascer- talined whether surgeons were wanted at all, and whether such surgeons as were examined by a competent medical board here, and sent out by private parties, would be assured in being granted regular positions as assistants in the army, to which inquiry Count Bismarck himself immediately replied that such offer was thankfully accepted. From this dispatch I obtained the authority to give you the certificate, stating that the conditions under which you should be appointed being fulfilled, you had been accepted here for the service as assistant surgeons in the German armies. The paper which I issued to you did:lnot bear upon its face the character of a "Commission," whch, of course, I could not mnake out, but of a "Certificate," and was meant for your legitimation, and in the words "By the authorization of the Federal Chancellor," pointed out to you and to every one to whom you might show it, the way how to seek remedy for a refusal of what was promised you. If at the first disregard of this certificate you had at once applied to that authority, justice would at once have been done you. Although Count Bismarck left Berlin soon after sending me his dispatch, the Foreign Office, especially the Secretary of State at the head of it, Mr. Von Thlelc, were well advised in the mat- ter from the beginning. They received my reports about these expeditions of surgeons regularly, and were aware of my certifi- cate without restraining me till after the middle of September. As early as on the 4th of September Mr. Von Thiele expressed to me his, painful surprise that three of the American surgeons, as he had just learned, should have been refused; he thought the surgeon general must have had good reasons, perhaps the imper- fcctness of their German, to reject them. He promised to invef- tigate the case, but meditated some provision at once to be made for the disappointed, perhaps by procuring them pieaces in private hospitals at Berlin. But in seeing Mr. Bancroft he learned that the gentlemen in question, who had been in Berlin,- had left   &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7753-00000041"/> 80 already for America. These gentlemen were still at Liverpool however on the 19th of September. It turns out from what they wrote me from there that Mr. Bancroft had not been doing more for th ththan to "manifest his astonishment at the manner in which they had been deceived," and to advise them to hurry back to New York and seek their indemnity from me. Now had your representative near the North German Govern- ment done so much as to proceed, with his injured countrymen, to the authority indicated in the papers they bore from the con- sul-general, asking from that official's chief an, explanation for what he regarded-as deceptive papers, you see from what I have told you that the whole matter'would have been explained and arranged satisfactorily in the case of the first sufferers, and meas- ures been taken to prevent occurrences which had already made a painful impression upon our government. Why Mr. Bancroft in this glaring case, did-not find his daily walk to the Foreign Office to protect the rights of his countrymen, I cannot account for.  I advise you now to send in your claim for all your expenses from the day you were left without provision till the day you were appointed, either directly to the Secretary of State, Von Thiele, Foreign Office, or to Mr. Frederick Kapp, meiber of the central committee' for the wounded at Berlin, bffice under den Linden, No. 12, who, as the representative of the German Amer- ican Associated Aid Societies, will attend to your cases. The contents of this letter you may use towards everyone. I shall be especially gratified if on the grounds of the statements I have made, you will occasionally dispel any erroneous impressions which may have been created in this matter by public discussions in the press of this country or in Germany. I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, JOHANNES ROSING, Consul General. The effect of the above communication was magical in the cases of Doctor Sharp and his countrymen, for within a very brief period they -received their appointments as surgeons and assistants, and were dispatched throughout Germany and France to dif-   ferent posts of duty-the annexed being a copy of the official order communicated to Dr. Sharp: COBLENZ, October 8th, 18-. JOSEPH SHARP, M. D.--You are hereby appointed Assistant Physician at the Reserve Hospital at Saarbrucken, and will report yourself at the Lazaretto Commission, there showing this order. Your salary will be three thalers per day, besides natural quarters. By order, THE PROVINCIAL GENERAL PHYSICIAN, 8th Army Corps. Our hero immediately took charge of the hospital at Saarbrucken, whilst an intimate friend, Dr. D---n, of Philadelphia, was stationed at St. Johann, a post on the opposite side of the river. These places are known as south German towns, and being rarely visited by our countrymen, the consequence is that Americans are almost unknown to the inhabitants. On the first evening Dr. S. and his Philadelphia friend were sent under escort to the residence of a Mr. Neoggrath, who at the time was mayor of Saar- brucken, and had discharged the duties of that office for the long period of forty years. It was soon known amongst the citizens, and also those of St. Johann, that two American surgeons had arrived in town, and were stopping at the residence of the mayor, and by the hour of 8 P. M., fully ten thou- sand persons blockaded the street to secure a sight of the foreigners, and soon becoming noisy in their anxiety to see them the mayor, with other officials, visited the doctors' apartments and informed them they would be obliged to gratify the curiosity of the   &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7753-00000042"/> 82 assemblage by going upon the balcony to show themselves. Good humoredly assenting to the pro- position, the venerable chief Inagistrate took one on either arm, and followed by the other city mag- nates, presented them to the vast concourse, briefly prefacing his introduction in these words : "Fellow citizens, I have the honorof introducing this even- ing, Drs. Dillman and Sharp, surgeons from North America, who are the first who have ever left their native land to come over and assist our King's surgeons in the glorious war his Majesty is wag- ing." Our hero and his lively companion, who now imagined themselves upon the pinnacle of fame, were clearing their throats in advance of the suitable acknowledgment they designed for the re- spect extended to them, when they were horrified and wished themselves elsewhere at the exclama- tions of the crowd : "Why, we thought they were black!" "Oh, ter tu?fel! they are the same as our-- selves!'"Dunder and blixen, we ish fooled dis time!" The disgusted physicians wNhose fond im- agination had wafted them to cloud-capped Olympus but a brief moment previous, now fell heavily from their lofty eminence, and forgetting to return their grateful thanks-for the thrilling honor conveyed in these remarks, hastily retreated to the interior of the hospitable mansion, not at all ambitious of a second summons before the public. Donning a national costume as a disguise, they ventured out the following morning to visit their respective hospitals, but did not succeed in eluding   83 the vigilance of the children, who followed them through the streets shouting, "Mericanor," '* Mer- icanor," or a Americans.' The excitement, how- ever, attending their arrival in town was gradually dissipated as the worthy citizenls became fully con- vinced our medical friends were not of the Ethiopian hue, and they now assumed formal possession of their future posts of duty. Dr. Sharp found, him- self in charge of one hundred and twenty-seven sick and wounded -men, many of them suffering from badly shattered limbs, requiring immediate opera- tions, and his surgical skill was therefore in active request. His prompt and bold system of proceed- ing ere long won for him the appellation of the "American butcher," and occasionally an incident calling for a display of his decisive character would vary the ordinary routine of his daily rounds; for example, meeting one morning the chief surgeon, he informed that official that at 4 P. M. he designed taking off the limb of a patient. At the hour stated the chief,- with a corps of other surgeons, were in attendance, one of the number being introduced as Professor G., With the remark that he, the profes- sor, would perform the operation. The American blood of our hero commenced rising at this interfer- ence, and the fire flashing in his eye, he answered, Cc No, sir, he will not. I came here from America with a surgical reputation; have been placed in charge of this hospital, and when I am unable to discharge the duty of a surgeon, I shall return to my native land." The chief having apologized for   &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7753-00000043"/> this presumption of the German, the amputation of the limb was successfully effected by Joseph, and henceforth on such occasions he was not interfered with. The doctor finding a number of his patients with broken limbs done up in the old awkward style of splints, introduced those in use by a renowned Bal- timore surgeon, the application of which was en- tirely new to the German practitioners, and the chief was so much pleased with the improvement and the ease with which the patients could move, that in all the hospitals under hiS control our young friend was requested to instruct others how to apply them. On one occasion the Emperor William, in passing through Saarbrucken, visited the hospital, and hearing from the chief surgeon the manner in which the American had refused interference with his duty, and also of the improvements he had intro- duced, observed, "My son, I am pleased at your display of self-respect, and at the relief you have afforded to many of our men. I will not forget you. I want your name and address in America, and you shall hear from me." This was of course gratify- ing, and a stimulant to renewed exertions. The only intimate acquaintance of our surgeon at this period was Dr. Dillman, who, as we have said, had charge of the hospital at St. Johann, on the opposite bank of the river Saar. The doctor was a quiet, well educated gentleman, and'of large experience, having for several years served in the United States navy. They roomed together, and Doctor Sharp    was much indebted to his companion for valuable assistance in both his studies and duties. When the labors of the day were completed, they frequent- ly became associates in adventures, for which the ancient town of Saarbrucken presented as wide a field as many of its more pretentious and populous neighbors. The  houses here, like most of the older cities of the; contlnent, are usually built of massive stone, and have the appearance of feudal fortresses. Car- pets are unknown, but are substituted by oiled and painted floors, and graced with scanty furniture. The streets are narrow and devoid of paved foot- ways. Here and there the eye is refreshed with the view of a public square, ornamented with sparkling fountains, to which the inhabitants resort for water, tid where, according to immemorial usage, the washing is done, and that but twice a year; the cus- tom being to wash only in the spring and fall and at the recurrence of these important eras, hundreds of young girls and staid matrons dressed in their traditionalshort blue petticoats, can be observed in the public squares or on the river banks, sporting like so many naiads, and apparently as happy as American maidens at a fashionable hop. Singing national airs, they can be seen morning and even- ing proceeding to these out-door laundries, carrying on their heads a tub, and in each hand a bucket, accompanied in many instances by their beaux, who though profuse in flattering phrases, are rarely known to relieve their fair companions of their bur"   &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7753-00000044"/> 86 den. Markets are also held in the public squares, and surrounding them  are scores of cows tied to wagons and -burdened with harness, as the animals are required:' to perform the work of horses, and when a customer applies they- are milked according to the amount desired. -The customs of these prim- itive people are also novel in other respects. No single gentleman can enjoy the privilege: of vis- iting the ladies unless engaged, and to effect an en- gagement are obliged first to dispatch a note to the fair one's house asking her'acceptance of him, and if it be agreeable, answer is sent by the same mode that the proposal is accepted, when the parents of both parties are informed of their wishes and inten- tions, and they make arrangements for a certain day, for the friends of the contracting. parties to meet at the bride's residence, and if they. have never met before, which is frequently the case, the bride's mother and the young man's father introduce them. After a brief conversation, if 'they are still of the same mind, they join hands in, the presence of their friends, afterwards partaking of a supper prepared for the occasion, and the same evening of the follow- ing week the entire party meet 'at the residence of the young man's parents to partake of supper. The day following this second festival, a card in the papers appears, and repeated three times, reading as follows: "Frederick, eldest son of AugusitHans, butcher, is engaged to be marriedto 'Katrina, scc- ond daughter of Wilhelmn Kline, c6arpenter."' Tile notice is posted outside of the police headquarters   87 for three consecutive days, and the young couple are now allowed to visit and appear -on the street together, a privilege they could not enjoy before their engagement. If the engagement be broken,. similar notice is then published and posted, :and they are not allowed thereafter to speak to each other.  In one of the narrowest and most retired streets of Saarbrucken, at tihe period of which we write, stood .an ancient inn, before which a ponderous 'swinging sign, bearing the full-length likeness in armor of Charlemagne, creaked drearily in the blustry: winter evenings, and :its saddening tones, together with the gloomy i oaken doors and dark stone walls of the :structure, would appear to a way- farer to forebode but meagre cheer within, but as we know appearances are ever deceptive, and when on entering its dim but capacious public room, the :buxom landlady's -daughter, Katrina, lifted her large, dark eyes from the spinning-wheel at which ,she was employed in one corner of the apartment, it seemed as if the feeble flickering light which illu-  mined:but partially the table on, which it rested, acquired a tenfold' brilliancy, and one sat down before the blazing logs in the great fire-place with a sense of genuine relief in escaping from the keen air and the silent, desolate street without. To this retired spot our hero frequently repaired when fatigued with his, arduous labors he desired to enjoy a quiet evening with his German pipe and mug of beer; and on the occasion we ihave aove alluded to  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7753-00000045"/> 88 he occlupied his customary arm-chair at the table, and for some weighty reason an unusual abstraction of manners debarred him from enjoying the winning glances that ever and anon beamed from the lively Katrina's eyes. "I will not judge him harshy," he murmured half audibly, " none know their strength till they are tried, and self-confidence should accompany vir- tue, not precede it. He will meet me here to-mor- row night, then all will be explained; but the cry of agony from the strong man asking for charity, for food, I can never, never forget."  To explain: but an hour before in hastening to the Charlemagne inn through one of the silent and desolate lanes of the town our friend, the doctor, had been suddenly stopped by a hoarse summons to halt, and immedi- ately a strong grasp and the flash of a glittering blade bewildered him for an instant, while in the next, the knife fell heavily upon the stones of the street, and in bitter tones his ears were greeted with the words, " O God, save me from this crime, but give me charity, give me food, that my child, sir, may not perish before my eyes." In the uncertain light Doctor Sharp perceived the stranger was no ordinary outcast, but a noble commanding looking personage, and felt at once an interest to ascertain the motives which led to this singular adventure, accordingly placing two thalers in the hand of his recent assailant bade him relieve his wants at once, and favor him with an interview at the inn on the following night, when he might be able to afford   89 him additional assistance. With an earnest and grateful pressure of the hand his protege gave the required promise, and with a fervent acknowledg- ment of thanks, disappeared in the gloom. CHAPTER VII. They who know the most,- Must mourn the deepest o'er the fatal truth,- The tree of Knowledge is not that of Life.-Byron. - shall now crave indulgence of the doctor's friends, whilst -for a brief season an entire new comlpany; of performers will occupy the stage; yet in making this transformation in scene and incident, we trust to-avoid the ill-natured comments of a class famed for dispensing with common - manners and common-humanity! They go under the name of critics. In the strictest sense they may be called men of letters, their study as weil as capacity being mostly confined to a- just or an orthographical disposition of the alphabet. Their business is to reconnoitre the, outworks of genius, as they have no key to the gates of nature or sentiment. They snuff faults from afar as crows *  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7753-00000046"/> 90 scent carrion, and delight to pick, and to prey, and to dwell upon them. They enter like wasps upon the gardens of literature, not to relish any fragrance or select any sweets, but to pamper their malevolence with everything that savors of rankness or offence. On entering the hospitable doors of the old-fash- ioned inn at the appointed- hour of the succeeding evening, Dr. Sharp found his unknown, unfortunate friend with folded arms, and apparently buried in thought, seated at one side of the comfortable fire- place. The physician having seated himself at the massive oaken table, motioned to the stranger to follow his example, and having first requested Katrina to furnish them with pipes, and a bottle of Rhenish, in a kindly tone desired the honor of his companion's name. "My name," was the response, "is John Willingham, and my country, like that of my noble benefactor, if I am not mistaken, Amer- ica. The doctor nodded assent, then added, "Mr. Willingham, I am astonished beyond measure that a person of apparent refinement and who has so much of the gentleman in his person and manner, should yet be reduced to such extremity in a Chris- tian country, and among a people distinguished for humanity. There must be something singular and, extraordinary in your case, and it was from being impressed with that conviction that I sought the present interview, and also that it might enable me to extend you and the child of whom you spoke, some durable service." The fine and expressive, yet sunken eyes of the stranger, glittered with tears   / 91 of gratitude at words of kindness, to which he had been long unaccustomed, and in tones of emotion, "Honored sir, " he replied, "C How truly inscrutable are the ways of God whose wisdom has preserved me till this hour, unstained with innocent blood or the commission of a crime, even when the madden- inl fever of despair drove me from my wretched abode, bent upon a deed of violence not to prolong my own unhappy hours, but to give sustenance to the emaciated, fast-failing daughter, my only child, my only tie on earth; yes, my benefactor, it was in behalf of that dear one, a maiden now of eighteen years, whose lips had tasted naught for eight and forty hours, that I raised against you, sir, a few hours since the murderous steel, and for which I beg God now and you, sir, to forgive me." A moment's pause and Willingham resumed, "To you, sir, the preserver of my daughter's life, I feel it due some explanation should be given of. the events which have reduced me, as you well remark, to extremity in a Christian land, and with your concurrence will narrate the past twenty years' history of my ca- reer." ' I shall be," returned the surgeon, " extremely pleased to have your narrative, for be assured, an ingenuous confession of past errors has a greater charm to me, and is, in fact, more amiable than if a man had never strayed." "I have strayed far and wide in judgment," an- swered Willingham, "but of the rectitude of my intentions, you shall be the judge."  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7753-00000047"/> 92 HSTORY OF JOHN WITTNGHAM. My birthplace is Baltimore in the ancient province of Maryland, and Richard Willingham, a grocer of Commerce street in that city, is my father. He was of low birth and narrow capacity, but proceeding in the dog-trot of. life and having a single eye to the acquisition of money, he became vastly rich, and derives a large income from houses and ground-rents in the city; and suburbs, the fruit of his own appli- cation. I remember nothing of my. mother nor her character, as she died in my Infancy, and I was the only surviving clhild, but presume my father loved her, as he transferred his tenderness to me. The love of my father was not the prejudice of a parent; it was not an affection; hee had a passion for me that could be equalled: by nothing but his vanity in my behalf. He resolved, he said, that there should be one gentleman inthe family; and with this view he waived his desire to have -me always in his sight, and sent me first to St. Mary's and thence to Yale College, where I remained till I was twenty years of age, without anything occurring that was uncom- mon or deserving .your attention. My father had infused into me a-strong tincture of his own vanity and views. I lost even a portion of that tenderness and respect which I'had feltin his regard. He was 1 a trader, and I sighed for his reptile state; I looked down upon him'as Icarus did on that very father from  whom  he had derived wings for his exalted flight.   93 My application was equal to my ambition. I was not merely a master, I was a critic in the classical languages.  I relished and commented on the beau- ties of the Greek and Latin authors ; was a connois- seur in the customs and manners of the ancients; I could detect the slightest transgression of a sculptor in the folding of a Roman toga. I had the honor of being intimate with the 'great of antiquity; I fre- quently sat in synod with the whole posse of hea- then gods on Olympus; I had traced the system of nature from Aristotle and Pythagoras down to Epicurus and Lucretius, thence down to the modern Des Cartes, and I was so thorough an adept in the subtleties of logic that I could confute and change sides with an adversary without losing an inch of ground. I imagined that I had arrived at the very pinnacle of human excellence, and that fortune and honor were within my grasp on either hand. I looked on the governship or the presidency as things that must arrive in due season, and I was contriving some station more adequate to the height of my merits and ambition, when I received this letter: SON JOHN-I have lately inquired into your life and character, and am sorry to find them too bad to give reasonable hope of amendment. Have lost my money and my child. You have cut yourself from my love; I have cut you from my fortune. To comfort myself, I have talken a neighbor's widow to wife. Come not near me; I will not see you. Would oray fory ou if I did not think it in vain. RICHARD WILLINGHAM. For some time after the receipt of this cruel letter I remained in a state of stupidity. I could not be-  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7753-00000048"/> lieve the testimony of my senses.  But awaking at     . last-from .this :lethargy, my soul' was rent by, differ-  I ent and. contending passions. :'Whatever contempt -Ii mlight have for the, station -of. xmy father, I still loved his person better than:riches and honors.  But he loved me: no i more.--hewas gone, lhe was lost; he was already dead and -buried, at -least to me.     I wept aloud and bewailed'him   as though he had lain a lifeless corpse before me.   At length I rose and  wrote my father an answer, of which this in my pos- session is a copy.  .                    SIR-If you had not wished to find those faults you charge to an irrepro achable life, you would not have given credit to scoun- drels who cannot-judge the conduct of a- gentleman; nor con- demned your only child without a hearing or defence. In cutting me from your fortune you take only that I despise, but in cutting -me from your love you unjustly rob me of what no fortune can repair. Could it be possible that a person of my talents and abilities should be reduced to indigence or distress;  you, sir, are the very last man on earth to whom I would apply,  or from  whom I would deign to accept'relief. But if, on the I other hand, it should please God hereafter to visit your hard- I heartedness with affliction and poverty, and that I, lile the son of the blacksmith in the days of King Henry, should stand next I the:fthrone in dignity and honors, you will then find sir, the fond- s est and most'dutiful of children in your little known and much ' injured son, JOHN WILLINGHAM.  I began  now  seriously to think. of the course I I ought to take, and considering Baltimore as a   .sphere in which a luminary would shine .with the -greatest- lustre, I returned to that city without delay.  Sell-  ing my scant furniture and 'most of. my books, and realizing in all some three hundred dollars, .secured  \ 1   -heleap- lodgings, .aMd:being but .little known; and re-: flecting that a hidden treasure cannot be'dulyy esti- mated, I daily frequented Temperly's 'coffee-house amidst a promiscuous throng of politicians, literati and sportsmen.  Happening here to distinguishi myself in argument on a few. occasions,: I began' to be regarded with some favor,/ and one morning an elderly gentlenman, who sat attentive in a corner, got: up and whispered: he would be. glad of my company, and a socialM drink in the next room-. ;I gratefully obeyed the invitation, and after imbibing ,a:glass of sherry- --                  ; "Mr. Willingham," said he, "you appear to have but few acquaintance and may possibly want a friend. My fortune is small, but I have some. influi ence in' town, and as I have taken an inclination- to; you, I should be glad to serve you.. 'If the questi0on is not too free, what is your present -dependence an;d prospects?"               :  .. Having acknowledged his kindness withi g'enhine warmth, I frankly confessed my circumstances were, very slender, and that I should be glad 'of any oc- l cupation wherein I could be useful to myself:and my employer.             -   . , "And pray," he resumed, "what place would'  best suit you?" "I hope, sir," was my answer,i that laying aside the manual crafts, my education has ben a-such,; there is not anything for which I am not qualified.'  "I am greatly pleased to hear it," repiied' the. old gentleman, whose name was Bradford, :"and H  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7753-00000049"/> 96 hope soon to bring you news that will not be disa- greeable." In a few days Mr. Bradford again entered the coffee-house with a-smiling aspect. He beckoned me aside: "Willingham," said he,--"I have the pleasure to tell you that I have brought you the choice of two advantageous places. Mr. Stone, the banker, wants a clerk who has some proficiency in arithllmetic, and writes a fair hand. And my good friend, Mr. Dis- count, the eminent merchant, would give place to a youth who understands the German method of book- keeping." My friend paused, and I hung my head and was wholly confounded. With some hesitation I an- swered: ' Perhaps, sir, you have happened on the only two positions in the universe of which I have no knowledge." "Well, well, my boy," said he, "don't be dis- couraged; I will try what further may be done ill your behalf." Within the next fortnight Mr. Bradford sent me a note to attend him at his lodgings in Monument Square. "My young friend," said he, as I entered, "I have now brought you the offer of two honorable places, one of which I trust will surely fit you. I have an old friend, the colonel of a regiment, now stationed on the Pacific coast, who has applied to me to recommend a person who has particularly ap-   97 plied himself to gunnery and engineering. The other is a popular merchant captain who would give any consideration to a young man of sense and let- ters, who might serve as a friend and companion, and who is proficient in the use of the chart and compass.? "Sir," said I, with a bewildered look, "I have been a student, as Goliath was a man of war, from my childhood, and if my tutors did not flatter me, my genius was extensive. I know all things from the beginning of time that the ancient or modern world accounted matters of valuable erudition, and yet I have not so much as heard of the use of any of these sciences now required by persons in high trust and commission." Mr. Bradford looked concerned and shook his head: "My dear Willingham," said he, "I do not doubt your talent or learning, but I begin to fear whether they have been directed or applied to any useful, purpose." He pondered a moment: "Perhaps I might get you into holy orders if you are that way inclined. Are you well read in theology?" "Yes, yes, sir," I answered briskly, ' I am per- fectly acquainted with the 'gods and manneis of worship through all nations since the deluge." "But are you," replied the old man, "equally versed in the Christian dispensation? Are you a master of the sense and emblematical reference that the Old Testament bears to the New?" "Sir," said I, " often with pleasure have! dipped A  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7753-00000050"/> 98 into the Bible, as there are many passages in it ex- tremely affecting, and full of imagery and the true sublime;" "My dear child," said the gray-haired Bradford, (' by all I can find, you know of no one thing of use to yourself or any other person living, either with respect to this world or the world to come. Could you make a pin, or form a pill-box, or shape a cobbler's last, or do any of those things by which millions daily maintain themselves and fanlilies, you would be better off. The ways of life for which your studies have best prepared you are physic and the law, but then they require great expense and years ofintense application. I have told you, Wil- lingham, that I am not rich, and if I were, it is not he who gives you money but he who puts you into a way of getting it, who does you a friendship. I am going to Matanzas for the establishment of my health, but before I go I earnestly wish you to fix on some manner of employing your time, that will enable you to earn a certain subsistence, for, believe me, it is not speculative science, no, nor all the money nor jewels upon earth that make any part of the real wealth of-this world. It is industry alone that constitutes the true riches of all mankind. At all events, let me see you again before I set out." I bowed and retired, the most mortified and dejected of beings. I cursed the vanity of my fafher. He must breed me a gentleman as though I had been born to no manner of end. Had I been the son of a cobbler, of a porter, an hostler, of the lowest   " wretch who earns his bread by the sweat of his brow, I should not have been reduced to the worst species of beggary; that of begging with sound limbs and a reasonable soul, the least pitied, though most piti- able of men, for that is the case of a poor scholar and a poor gentleman. One evening as I returned late, fatigued and disheartened, through Howard street, I observed a man very importunate with a woman who walked before me. Sometiines she would hurry on and again make a full stop, and earnestly beseech him to leave her; but, in spite of her en- treaties, he stuck close to her till coming to the end of an alley, he suddenly seized her by the arm and pulled her in after him. She shrieked for help, and springing hastily forward and drawing a knife, I exclaimed, "Villain! quit the woman instantly or you are a dead man!" He perceived the glittering of the weapon and retiring a few paces, took out a pocket pistol, and discharging it full at me, turned and fled. The ball lodged in my left shoulder and I felt a brief pang, but not attending to it I offered my arm to the woman to escort her safely, and on asking her residence, was told Lexington street, where she conducted a millinery. We had not far to go and made the best speed, and on reaching the place were admitted by a servant maid, who ushered us to a back parlor. "Jennie," said Mrs. Marcus (that was her name), "bring the gentleman some of the cordial and a glass. You look pale, sir;,I hope you are not hurt?"   &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7753-00000051"/> 100     d N"Not much, I think, madam, but have a pain in my left shoulder." "Sir, this was a dreadfill affair, and I owe you my prayers and blessings to the last hour of my life. Jennie, where's Eleanor?" "At the Miss Hodges', madam." Come, resumed Mrs. Marcus, "I must look at your arm," and removing my coat, "God pre- serve me, sir," she gasped, '"I fear you are wounded dangerously." "Jennie, fly to Dr. Walton's; bring him with you; do not come without him!" "Madam,"' I here remarked, " the wound cannot be of consequence, but I was greatly fatigued at the time I had the happiness to rescue you from that ruffian.'." The surgeon came, and looking at my wound, said something apart to Mrs. Marcus, who ordered Jennie to get a fire made, and warm the bed in then best room. "Sir," said I, with a smile, although it cost me an effort, "you must not alarm nor put the lady to inconvenience." "You must not think of stirring from hence at- 'present," he rejoined. '"The ball may cause you much pain to extract it. By the time your bed is ready I will be back with the dressings." During the surgeon's absence. Mrs. Marcus, though weeping freely, was all attention to me, and I sat alternating between fears of the result and hopes that the adventure might lead to some lasting advantage.   When the dbctor returned I was conducted to my room, and suffered great anguish in the extraction of the ball, and having passed a very restless night and being the next day seized with a delirious and prostrating fever, lay nearly insensible for two long weeks. My first remembrance at the close of this period is, that of beholding a very lovely lady of less than twenty summers arrayed in white, and seated at the bedside. -I was bewildered and ex- claimed: "Tell me, fair creature, on what world am I thrown?" But placing her finger to her lips, and without reply she rose from her seat and left the apartment, but almost immediately returned accompanied by Mrs. Marcus. The elder lady, making no observa- tion, took my hand in hers, and burst into tears. "Ah, Mrs. Marcus," said I, "I fear you have had a troublesome guest in me." , "( Pray say no more," was the reply, in a gracious tone. "We remember that trouble no more, now that you are conscious." In the few succeeding days that I was confined to the room, I gave my fair friends, the mother and her daughter Eleanor, a brief sketch of my history; and as I had now, as it were, no relation nor friend upon earth, this good woman and her child became all the world to me, and I could not forbear in my looks discovering to Eleanor that my feelings were those of the most affectionate of brothers, though I could not indulge in those familiar endearments 9*       '  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7753-00000052"/> 102 which a nearness of kindred would venture to claim. When at length able to be about the house I re- quested Mrs. Marcus to make out her bill for my board, the surgeon's charge, drugs and so forth, during my long illness, but regarding me with a glance of subdued reproach, she exclaimed: "Mr. Willingham, I think you are too generous to reproach us with what we owe you, and what is it, my child, you desire me to charge you with? Is it for rescuing me from death or a shame worse than death--probably from both? or for delivering 'my daughter from the bitter grief and distress that my loss must have brought upon her?  Or do you desire to pay us for the fearful pains and sickness which you suffered on our account? No, Mr. Wil- lingham, you must not think of paying us the debts that we owe you, more indeed than the industry of our lives can ever repay."' I was silenced but not convinced, and determined to have revenge for this generosity Two days after, while Mrs. Marcus was at market and Eleanor had gone with a new. hat to a young lady of distinction, I stepped into the shop where Jennie was in tem- porary waiting. I had scarcely entered when a sheriff's officer appeared at the door, and gliding in, laid an execution on the shop for eighty-five dollars and   cents, at the suit of a Mr. Lewis, a straw goods merchant. I was surprised and grieved, but pleasure quickly succeeded my concern, and taking out my wallet I immediately discharged the debt and costs, and bribed Jennie not to betray a syllable   103 of what had happened, to Mrs. Marcus or her daughter. Soon after, both ladies returned, and the same day before the cloth was removed at dinner, Jennie came in and delivered a note to her mistress. She perused it with apparent surprise, asked if the messenger was waiting, and stepped to the door., Again she seated herself, and without speaking, burst into tears. "What is the matter?" cried Eleanor, as she threw her arms around her mother. "O, Eleanor, this young man distresses me beyond expression. He has this ory day, my love, snatched us from instant ruin for the second time; I would tell you if I could speak, but read that note." -The note was signed Samuel Lewis, and' stated how much he regretted that recent heavy losses had placed him under the necessity of laying an execu- tion on her house, without the customary notice, acknowledged the receipt of the amount due and cost, and hoped that the affair would make no dif-. ference with respect to their future dealings. "And why, best of women," said I to Mrs. Marcus, " why should you grieve that I should endeavor to relieve myself from a part of that burden with which you have so greatly oppressed me?  Would that it were in my power to show you the love I have for you; for you and your daughter are the world to me, and form the only concern I have therein."' "' Since that is the case, Mr. Willingham," said  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7753-00000053"/> 104 the milliner, smiling through her tears, "if you will admit an equal passion from one so old as I am, it were a pity we should ever part. Send, my child, this very day and discharge the debt you owe for lodgings. All cares are lessened by the society of those we love, and our satisfaction will be dou- bled by feeling for each other." I was truly delighted to accept this generous invitation, and without any formal agreement with Mrs. Marcus, all my little matters were immedi- ately brought home. How, happy were many suc- ceeding days.   How still more happy when con- trasted with the misery that ensued rn One evening Mrs. Marcus returned home more dejected than ordinary. I inquired into the cause- with a countenance that naturally expressed the interest that I took in her concerns. "My dear child," said she, "perhaps I have been indiscreet, but I meant all for the best. You must know  that I have been on a visit to your father." "To my father, madam?" "Even   so. I would to heaven that he were worthy to be called father to such a man. I sent in my name with the word that I came to him onl business of consequence I was shown  to a back parlor where he sat in company with your step- mother, who has a very comely and good-natured countenance.  Mrs. Marcus, said your   father, pray be seated.  What are your commands with me, madam? I   came. sir, to let you know that   105 your son, Mr. John Willingham, has been at the point of death. ' Have you nothing to say: to me, madam, but what concerns my son John?' The reply was, I have not, I confess, sir--but that is more than enough--it is interesting and affecting, and concerns you most nearly. Here he rose from his seat and taking up a book pressed it to his lips, observing, ,I swear by the virtue of this holy book, that I will not listen to any person who will speak a word in behalf of John Willingham. So, madam, give me leave to show you out again.' I turned and said to your stepmother: O, madam  what kind of heart is yours that refuses intercession on this occasion?  A frowning look was the only answer, and after being accompanied to the street door by your father, I simply remarked: I am- sorry, sir, that a man of your grave and sensible appearance should suffer yourself to be duped by people whose interest it is to deceive you. With no other reply than an angry look, he then shut the door behind me, and in short, my dear child, I fear I have done you harm where good was in- tended." "It matters not, my dear Mrs. Marcus," said I. f Very soon I trust to procure some kind of inde- pendent living, and while I have you and Eleanor, I shall want neither father nor friend."' Being now nearly re-established in health, I set out again in search after some employment that might suit me. As I was strolling on Fayette street, I observed a store on my left hand and   , .   e  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7753-00000054"/> 106 found it was that of Mr., Landis, a bookseller and printer. Stepping in, after some introductory dis- course, I asked him if he had occasion in the way of his business for a friend of mine, a gentle- man in distress, but a man of talents and address. "Alasi, sir, such creatures as you mention are a drag upon earth; there is a glut of them in every market. I would give a half eagle per man to any one who will deliver me from three or four who are now on my hands. Not, sir, that they are idle, but I can get one of these gentlemen, on whose educa- tion more money has been expended than at legal interest would maintain a decent family for years. I can get one of them, I say, to labor like a hack horse from morning to night, at less wages than I can hire a porter for three hours ; and then sir, they have all such aspects of despondency that a man may with less melancholy behold a death's head, or an insane retreat..' While Landis was speaking, I made a secret vow against having anything to do with booksellers or printers for a century to come; yet I affected as easy an air as possible, and observing some females -stitching pamphlets I inquired if they contained anything new or entertaining, "Sir," said Landis, "this is an elaborate per- formance of the most eminent of our writers. I pay him, at the lowest, twenty-five dollars weekly, and could any man write with doublet his spirit and genius, I could afford to give him a hundred, for good writings are much like diamonds, and are si   107 valued according to their carats; double their weight and they immediately become of twenty times the estimation." The pamphlet consisted of one sheet sewed in blue paper. I paid a dime thr a copy and sat down to peruse it. It contained several very free remon- strances against the. Government and the head of the Treasury in particular, concluding with some com- monplace observations in behalf of American free- dom and onerous taxation; in fine, I perceived that it was written with more judgment than genius." "And what," said I to the publisher, " will you give to the man who shall excel this most eminent of patriots upon his own subject, and in his own way?" "Give, sir," replied Landis, " many thanks, and a proportionable extra compensation."  "Enough, sir; you shall soon hear from  me again, and for the present I wish you good day." On my return home I called in Monument square at the lodgings of Mr. Bradford, but learned he had gone to Matanzas two weeks previously. I sat down to my work with the determination to suc- ceed, and having finished the undertaking in about a week, and given it the title of the "Weekly Censor," I took it directlyto Mr. Landis. ( Here," said I, "'is my friend's first venture." acd have a few moments to throw away," was the reply, "and they are at your service." He then took a seat, and having read a score of lines-  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7753-00000055"/> -108 "Ay, ay 1" exclaimed he, "your friend reverses the rule of the turf, and sets out at the top of his speed." Reading-further, he cried-"Well supported, by Jupiter!" And proceeding to the third page- "this," he observed, " must have been stolen from one of the ancients, for there is no modern could write like it. Well, sir, you need not give your- self further trouble for the present. I will print this first paper at my own cost. Desire your friend to be careful about the second. Call 'on- me in a week and I think I shall be able to tell you some- thing that will please you." I rushed to my new home with the feathers of Mercury at my heels, and set about my second paper with double genius and application. My ideas were now expanded, my spirits sublime. All the thunder of Demosthenes was in my pen; all that I had read on the topic of liberty in popular governments or commonwealths occurred to my re- membrance. I finished my essay within the week, and going to Landis, he presented me with a check for one hundred dollars. "It is more," said he, "than I have ever paid, but I trust in the run not to be a loser. The demand for this paper has been very uncommon, and the sale in time may amount to twelve -thou- sand copies. You need not be ashamed to acknow- ledge yourself the author. Preserve but a moiety of the spirit with which you have set out, and my own interest will instruct me to serve you effec- tually." *   ; I          F;,   109 I now returned as in a triumphal chariot, and hastened to confide my good fortune to the two loved objects of my solicitude. Jennie told me her mistress was not at home, but Miss Eleanor was in her own room. I ran up and tapped at the door, which was opened, and I perceived Eleanor looking pale, with swollen and downcast eyes. Noticing she had been in tears, a sudden chill took posses- sion of all my happiness. "What has happened, my dearest Eleanor?" was my first exclamation. "I wish you had not come at this time, Mr. Willingham," she coldly replied; " but you will permit me to retain my grief to myself." "If it be your pleasure, most certainly Miss Eleanor."  - "Mr. Willingham," she exclaimed with an im- ploring look, "your' soul is too generous, I dare not tell you; but we must part-indeed we must- we must part Mr. Willingham, and that at once."  Here her voice failed, and throwing herself into a chair, she gave vent to a flood of tears. For a moment I stood astonished, and then dropping on one knee beside her, awaited the suspension of her grief. Perceiving my position- " ise, sir," she'cried, "I entreat you, and take a seat near me whilst I will endeavor to tell you the cause of this distress. This morning I was at the Misses Hodges ; they are sincere friends of mothler and myself, and told mc with mucl concern of whispers in the neighborhood -that mother had 10  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7753-00000056"/> "O entertained a young gentleman in the house who was admitted to very familiar intimacies, and that the consequence of such reports must be detrimental. Now, Mr. Willingham, I am not. ashamed to confess that I have nothing in heaven but my innocence nor on earth but my character, and I think you wish me better than to desire that I should forfeit the one or the other." "Desire it I heavens!"I exclaimed, "I would forever guard them both to the last drop of my  blood!" "But, alas!" resumed Eleanor, " you are the man of all others whom the world would not admit for my champion in this case. It is painful to sep- arate, but a duty that must be complied with." "But, my sister, my dear girl, tell me, is there no other way, no expedient to satisfy a misjudging world, save a remedy that is -worse than death itself?" "There is no other expedient," replied the fair girl; " at least, no other to which I can consent.", "O, Miss Marcus, if such is indeed the case, you shall be obeyed. I am sensible that it would not be manly to be importunate. Adieu then, Eleanor,: adieu forever!" I suddenly withdrew and gave, as I imagined, the farewell look. "Hold," she cried, " pray do not leave me in the greatest of errors. Is it possible, Mr. Willing- ham, that you could think I mean to slight you? ah, no, sir, of all men living I I thought onily of   protecting my mother's name and my own. I, perhaps, have not understood you; indeed, I scarce know what I say or mean myself, but oh, be assured, I never can, nor ever did, mean any offence to our preserver. While she spoke I knelt before her, and taking her hand pressed it to my lips. "My own Eleanor," said I, " this very morning the world should not have prevailed with me to have accepted this hand for which I now kneel. I was then wretched and poor, and without resource; and I could not think of bringing distress upon her, independent of whose happiness I could have no enjoyment. I was sensible that I loved you with truth and intensity ; but my passion did not dare to admit of hope. I could have suffbred all things to have heaped blessings on you; but I could not be the instrument of trouble." "Rise, sir, I implore you, rise," faltered Eleanor, while a tear glistened upon her cheek, " and forgive me the injury I would have caused you." "Have I my loved- one," rising and handing her to a seat, " the untold happiness to believe that my sentiments may hope for a return?" The beautiful countenance of Eleanor, suffused with blushes, rested on my arm, and I asked no further answer. When Mrs. Marcus returned, I told her of my extraordinary success at the publishers, and I con- jectured Eleanor had made known the event above narrated, as I observed the eyes of her mother dwelt  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7753-00000057"/> "2 upon me with a fresh accession of fondness and de. light. Having finished my third paper, I received from Landis the same liberal amount, and now looked upon myself as in the certain receipt of a plentiful income, and this encouraged me to press for the completion of-my happiness.  Ere long Eleanor Marcus and myself were privately married in the presence of the Misses Hodges and two or three other neighbors, andlI became the possessor of the noblest of women. Just as John Willingham reached this interest- ing portion of his narrative, the great clock in the hall struck eleven, and Doctor Sharp, laying down his pipe, observed: "I have become greatly interested, sir, in your history, but as the evening is wearing away, pardon me if I now interrupt "you, and if to-morrow night will suit you to resume its continuation, it will afford me infinite pleasure to meet you at your own abode, and if you will furnish me with the address I will call promptly at the hour of eight." "The claims of gratitude, my noble young friend," said Willingham, "w till ever bind me to you, and although the wretched domicil in which my poor child is now screened from the keen air of winter, is one it grieves my soul to have you enter, yet your kindness will forgive the poverty of an outcast countryman of your own in this land of strangers." "Do not brood over your misfortunes with too sensitive promptings," rejoined the physician in a   IL  tP kindly tone, " but enable me to come at our next interview prepared, in some measure, to alleviate them ;" and thus saying, after receiving from John Willingham the required direction, with a cordial grasp of the hand, they separated for the night. CHA2PTER     VIII. A wise man poor, Is like a sacred book that's never read. T was a cold starlight evening when the surgeon left his lodgings in quest of Willingham, and after threading many abscure and filthy lanes and alleys in the most wretched suburb of the town, lhe arrived at a miserable court, and pausing in front of the corner house he V- }})gazed up in surprise at its shattered and {, unlit windows, -and noticed that the tiles torn from the roof lay scattered in confusion upon the uneven footway. The fabric which was of great antiquity, appeared so shackly and insecure, that the eye rested upon its desolate walls with a sensa- tion of pain and dread. It seemed indeed a very mockery of shelter from the frosts of winter, too dreary even for the beggar to prefer it to the open * \10  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7753-00000058"/> "4 road or the inhospitable porch. The summons of the rusty iron knocker brought a quick response from Willingham, and by the flickering light of a candle he guided his visitor up two flights of a ruinl- ous stairway, and opened the door of a small forlorn apartment, which served the double purpose of din- ing and drawing room. Motioning the doctor to one of the three seats, which, with an ordinary pine table, comprised the entire furniture of the apart- ment, John Willingham stepped into the narrow passage and called his daughter. Almost in an instant she appeared, and being introduced by her father as his dear and only child. Kate Willingham, exclaimed with warmth: "Doctor, I scarce need introduction -to the kind benefactor of my father, and my own preserver from the horrors of famine. O permit me, sir, to thank and bless you for the infinite service you have ren- dered us both." "Be assured, my dear Miss Willingham, that the genuine pleasure I derive from having assisted a fellow-being at so critical a moment, more than repays me, and as an earnest of my sympathy in your present difficulty, allow me to place in your father's hands this humble amount until a suitable -position can be procured that will place him and his child at least above want." As he spoke, Doctor Sharp laid upon the table a purse containing forty dollars. Whilst the unfortunate man, unable in words to express his thanks, could only press his hand in   "5 token of gratitude, the daughter sat down and con- cealing her face, silently gave way to her emotion.. Never in the history of our hero, had he came in contact with two beings, so deeply interesting as those before him. The father, with his broad and ll(assive brow, denoting a superior intellect, andtsur- mounting a face at once firm and gentle, was a man calculated to leave a marked impression on any one; but the small graceful figure of Kate, with her resigned and truly beautiful expression, her finely formied mouth, and eyes that once seen could never be forgotten, had at once, shall we say attracted, no, but fairly fascinated the susceptible heart of the surgeon ; his gaze could not be directed from her image during that memorable evening of his first visit, and though ten years her senior, he felt that henceforth, without the love of Kate Wil- linghanm, life would be to him but an empty blank. Doctor Sharp, perceiving that the task devolved upon him of directing the feelings which oppressed his entertainers into another channel, after a brief suspense, requested Willingham to resume the nar- rative of his life at the point at which, on the, previous evening it had been suspended, and taking a seat opposite Kate and his benefactor, he resumed-: Job very justly says: "Shall we receive good at the hands of God, and not receive evil?"And yet, I imagine, that the recollection of past happiness rather heightens than alleviates the sense of present distress. I had in two- months after my marriage received about six hundred dollars on the sale of my -  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7753-00000059"/> "6 essays, when, on. going abroad one evening, I was stopped within a few doors of my house by a gen- teel-looking man, who asked if my name was Wil- lingha;m? It is, sir, was my answer. Then, sir, said he, I arrest you in the name of the State, for a libel against the government. Then, beckoning to a sergeant of police, he'directed me to follow him to prison.       ' As I was not of a timorous nature nor conscious of the smallest tincture of the crime with which I was charged, I should have made but little more than a jest of this business had I not feared for the apprehensions of those who I knew would tremble for me. Oi the way the officer informed me that my bookseller had betrayed'me, and had confessed to the government that I was the author of a famous pamphlet, entitled "The Weekly Censor." Being delivered to the custody of the warden, I was con- ducted to a decent apartment, considering the place. I immediately sent for an eminent advocate, Wil- liam P. Morton, whom I had once feed in behalf of Mrs. Marcus; and at the same time sent for a set of the Weekly Censor. When Mr. Morton came I put a gold eagle into his hand, and having told him iny case, requested him to peruse the papers in question, and to give me his opinion thereon. Having read them with due attention, Mr. Wil- lingham, said he, I perceive that you are a young man of learning and ingenuity; but I find that you are better acquainted with the republics of Greece   than with the nature and constitution of our own. Yet, there is nothing grossly scurrilous or malicious throughout these papers, nor what may amount to the incurring of a penalty by the most violent con- struction of the sense. If you are inclined to pro- ceed in the composition of these writings, I would (advise you to enter bail, and to stand the action. But as I am persuaded the government has com- menced this prosecution as a matter merely in terrorem, to deter, you from a work that gives them great disgust-why, if you have an influential friend who would solicit in your favor, and promise conduct in future more amenable to their wishes, you would undoubtedly be discharged without fur- ther cost or trouble. I returned my warm acknowledgments to the lawyer for his friendly counsel, and told him I would consider on it before I gave him any further trouble. When he was gone I despatched a letter to Mrs. Marcus, wherein I gave her an account of my pres- ent situation, in a manner as little alarming as- possible. I also requested her to procure bail for my release at an early moment; and from this fatal event I date the origin of all my troubles.  The noble women, my Eleanor and Mrs. Marcus, for five days sought in vain to secure a friend will- ing to risk the heavy amount required, until at last they were directed to a professional, a barrister of the name of Mortimer, who for a large considera- tion agreed (with ulterior villainy in view) to be my security. To effect this object the poor creatures  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7753-00000060"/> "8 sacrificed their stock, and with it every dollar of their little savings; and-on arriving home from the prison I met the first cause of alarm--the shop was shut up I I was shocked, and felt a sudden chillness come upon me, but did not venture to inquire, ex- cept by my eyes. But when seated at tea I could no longer contain myself. Leaning my head upon the cloth, bitter tears of anguish filled my eyes, and in broken tones I .reproached myself with being the author of their common ruin I Mrs. Marcus, struggling to suppress her tears, exclaimed: Do not grieve, my child; do not afflict yourself for nothing. All is as it should be. There is no harm done. Eleanor and I can always earn a gen- teel living without shop or other means than the work of our hands. We can never want. We have done nothing for you, John; what we did was to relieve the anguish of our own hearts; to bring you home to us again, since we have found that we could no longer live without you." I perceived ere many days that Eleanor's mother began to decline in health, occasioned by her late fatigue and anxiety of mind. I brought an able phy- sician to her aid, and Eleanor and myself attended constantly to her wants. But, alas! our cares and remedies, our attention and solicitude, our prayers and tears, proved equally unsuccessful, and at the ter- mination of five months she expired within our arms. My poor wife was horror-struck, and with the excla- ;mation, "O. my dearest, dearest mother! my only parent!" fainted upon the lifeless body.   "9 'Depend, sir, I well regarded this loss to be the greatest I had ever sustained, and should have sub- sided into a settled gloom without energy or hope, had it not been that the birth of this sweet child, taking place shortly after the death of her grandmother, aroused my dormant energies and gave a new direc- tion to my thoughts. Whien we had discharged the funeral expenses, I found the fortune of Eleanor and myself did not amount to fifty dollars. I was about leaving the house one evening when a loud rapping at the door caused me to change the inten- tion, and removing my hat I took a seat by my wife. Jennie answered the summons and announced that Mr. Mortimer was in the parlor and desired to speak with me. I went down, greatly surprised and somewhat alarmed at the visit. Although my release from prison was due to this man, yet I entertained an undefinable fear and dislike of his friendship, not- withstanding his reputation for ability at the bar and his popularity in the political arena. My re- pugnance to the man arose from the fact that he was a confessed libertine, and his intimate associates men of no character. On entering the room, "Mr. Willingham," said he, with a familiar air, "I have long wished to see you; but I did not think it seasonable to disturb you during the misfortune of your family, and the illr ss of your wife. Your Weekly Censors have genits and spirit, but they have done some mischief which we wish to have remedfied." "As how, pray, Mr. Mortimer?' d ,  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7753-00000061"/> 16V - Why, Mr. Willingham, I never knew a writing in favor of liberty or against government measures, which the populace did not wrest into an agreement in favor of licentiousness. Now, my dear sir, we want you to undertake our cause ; in short, we want you to refute your own papers." "Mr. Mortimer," I answered, c I should think it an honor to serve you or the government on any other occasion. But in a matter that must bring public infamy upon me, indeed, sir, you must excuse me. I should be pointed at as an apostate, a polit- ical prostitute by all men, and bring my person and writings into such disgrace, as would forever disa- ble me from serving either myself or the commu- nity." "Well, then, sir," said he, smilingly, "I will not insist on a formal refutation of your own writ- ings. I only ask if you are willing to engage in our quarrel, as far as is consistent with honor and truth?" "I am, sir," I replied, "so far as is consistent with my own credit and the good of my country." ' The good of your country l" exclaimed Morti- mer; "I hope you do not think our administration. is contrary to the good of your country? Pray, in what do you make this liberty consist, of which you are become so eminent a patron?" "There are two sorts of liberty, Mr. Mortimer, "I rejoined. "The first constitutes the duty and happi- ness of a man independent of community ; the second constitutes the privilege and happiness of a man, P   merely as he is a member of' any State or Common- wealth. Independent of a community, a man is so far free and no further, than he acts up to the dic- tates of reason and duty, but, as a member of it, he is so far free and no further, than as every other member of that community is legally restrained from injuring his person or encroaching on his property." "Inimitably well defined," cried Mortimer. "I have read volumes in folio upon this subject, but never knew what liberty was before. I therefore request you, my dear sir, to write a treatise to the purpose of your definition, and take us with you as far as you can. We shall not be ungrateful; we are good paymasters, sir. Why do you hesitate? Did you not tell me you were disposed to serve us?" "Mr. Mortimer," was my answer, "I fear I should fall greatly short of your expectations. I am not studied in the constitution of modern States; and how shall I be able to justify any gov- ernment with respect to measures that, perhaps, are a secret to all except the cabinet? I must fur- ther observe that my former field would be greatly contracted on this occasion. It is very easy and ob- vious to find fault and to call in question, but diffi- cult to vindicate truth itself against popular preju- dice." "Mr. Willingham," returned the lawyer, "I am proud that we have got a, gentleman of so much honesty and ingenuity to befriend us. It shall be my care to provide you with materials, and I am  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7753-00000062"/> 122 confident that so great a master of his instrument as you are, will make excellent music on a few fun- damental notes. Here are one hundred dollars as a retainer, and fifty dollars weekly, till we can fix you in some station of honor and advantage." On the third morning after this interview, Mr. Mortimer called in his carriage with a large bundle of pamphlets, and some manuscript notes and hints for my instruction. He breakfasted with us, and was easy, polite and cheerful. I now entered on my new province, but not with my usual ardor. As I had formerly lashed the insolence and rapacious- ness of power, less ambitious of conquest over aliens and enemies, than over the very people it was chosen to orotect, I now, on the other hand, rebuked with like acrimony the riotous, seditious propensities of a turbulent and unsatisfied people. I proved, from many authorities, derived from Greece and Rome, that power is never so dangerous to a populace as when it is taken into their own hands; that an- archy is the most direct of all roads to tyranny; and that an unruly people reduce themselves to the ne- cessity of being crushed and insulted, whether they will or no. Now, Doctor, though I thus alternately sided with the people against power, and with power against the people, yet I struck at nothing but faults on either hand, and equally asserted on botlh sides of the question, the cause of my country, of liberty, and truth. I took five times the pains with these latter papers that I did with the former,   123 but confess I had not equal pleasure in the delivery. I am also persuaded that in point of sentiment, moral and general instruction, they were of twenty' times the value to mankind; yet 'how can that in- struct which is not attended to? It was intimated to the people that they were written at the instance of officials, and they would not; have listened to an oracle if uttered from that quarter. Six months elapsed in the performance of these labors, and I delivered to Eleanor twelve hundred dollars as the result of my work. We had lived with great fru- gality  My wife had taken in as much work as nursing and attention to the 'child would admit, and our prospects were cheerful and happy, when one fatal day, Mr. Mortimer called upon me, and said he wanted a word with me in private. Eleanor, glancing at me, left the room, and Mortimer, with a smile, remarked: "Yesterday, my dear fellow, I had some conver- sation about you, withleaders of our party, and they assure me of a good position for you shortly, independent of your weekly pay of fifty dollars, while we keep you so hard at work. But tell me, Willingham," said he, laying his hand familiarly on my shoulder, " are you of a jealous temper?" "The furthest from it, Mr. Mortimer, of any man breathing. ' "Oh! I am glad of that; but if you were, I have nothing exceptionable to propose. To be short, half a dozen of my friends, men of strict probity, have engaged me to spend a portion of to-  h  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7753-00000063"/> 124 morrow in a pleasure party at Green Springs ; and we hlave each of us laid a foolish wager of a hun- dred dollars, that from the number of his relations, his friends, or acquaintances, he will bring the prettiest woman to this field of contention. I had fixed on Miss Fannie Lorimer, a relation of my own, and a lovely creature, but she unfortunately happened to be pre-engaged to one of my rivals. I am therefore quite at a loss, and must infallibly lose my wager if you do not favor me with the company of Mrs. Willingham. With her I can make no question of victory; and I give you my honor to place in her hands the whole sum of five hundred dollars, the just prize of her beauty." "Why, my good friend," said I, "this is indeed a very pleasant project, and has nothing in it ex- ceptionable, that I can perceive, if no one was to know of the matter. But what will the world say to see Mr. Mortimer thus paired?" "Pshaw, never heed the world, Willingham!" "You have the right, Mr. Mortimer," I rejoined, "to scorn an inferior world, but the world has an equal right, and would certainly make use of it, in scorning my wife. " "What!" said he, warmly, " you will not then confide her to my friendship and honor?" ' "I will not, Mr. Mortimer, confide her unnecessa- rily to any man, nor to any protection but that I pledged her in marriage." "It is very well, Mr. Willingham; you, may hear from me to-morrow."   And away he went. L   125 He was equal to his word. The very next morn- ing I was arrested at his suit for the sum of twelve hundred and fifty dollars, the entire amount I had received at his hands; and as imprisonment for debt was then the law of Maryland, I was hurried to the city jail, without being permitted to speak to any one.  As Mortimer knew that on a trial I must cast him in his suit, and further come upon him for special damages and false detention, it occurred to me at once that this was merely a strata- gem for the ruin of Eleanor, and her defenceless condition gave me inexpressible anguish. I imme- diately wrote her an account of my situation and apprehensions, which unhappily for all parties were too well founded. But, sir, I will not afflict you or myself by giving a detail of these extraordinary days in my history. Sufficient -to say that, taking  advantage of my absence, Mr. Mortimer paid my wife a visit ; that he had the audacity to make base over- tures, and to proffer her a large amount. The former she, repulsed with scorn; the latter she cast after him as he retreated, baffled and enraged. She then at once by the sale of furniture and other articles which she could spare, together with! what she had put away of my earnings, raised sufficient to secure my release, and having finished her toilette to visit the prison was about leaving the house, when the licentious Mortimer entered. Then began the first act of the tragedy which shadowed our life so long; he had bribed her servants and filled the kitchen with his dissolute followers. At once, and casting I           F        e  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7753-00000064"/> "U aside all disguise, he addressed Eleanor in terms loathsome to her pure nature; and disregarding her -pathetic appeals to his better feelings, he proceeded to lay rude hands upon her person. Then it was, sir', that stung to the quick by his insults, and with the aroused indignation of a faithful wife, she became the avenger of endangered honor by stabbing her brutal assailant to the heart. When the fatal blow was given, she ran at once to the cradle where the infant lay crying; pressing it to her bosom she stepped softly down stairs, opened the outer door, rushed into the street and hurried on till she came to a stand of coaches, where she hired the first she met, sprang hastily into it and desired the man to drive with all speed to the prison. On her arrival she discharged the action of debt and costs attached, and then hurried up to my apartment. On the first glimpse I caught her to my arms with speechless transport; but, finding the child with her, and observing her breath was quick and uneven, I stepped back and looked eagerly at her. She was pale and had a kind of wildness in her eyes and motions. What is the matter, my love, I cried ; what has happened to you? "I have not been well, "she replied, with an un- concerned manner before the keeper. "But come down, dear John; you are wanted, and the carriage is waiting." Nothing further was said until we got into the coach, when my wife desired the man to drive to a neighboring street, and stop at the first boarding house. 9   "For lodgings again," I demanded; "for whom does my Eleanor desire to take lodgings?" "For you and me, John,-for you and me, she. cried, wringing her hands. "Mr. Mortimer lies weltering in his blood at our house, deprived of life by this unfortunate hand." I was struck dumb with surprise and horror. All the consequences of this direful event whirled through my imagination in rapid succession. What would now become of my noble wife?  What in- dignities must have been offered her, ere she could be brought to perpetrate so terrible a deed? I grew sick and faint with oppressive thoughts, but in a few moments, having stopped at a house on Orleans street, I engaged a back room on the second floor, at one Miss Jamart's, an old maid and mantuama- ker. The evening had now closed in. I dreaded to inquire of what I still more dreaded to understand; and Eleanor seemed to labor under some terrible oppression, but, getting the child to sleep, and kneeling by its side, she broke into a violent-torrent of' tears, intermingled with convulsive sobs. I sat still without seeming to observe her emotion. I was sensible that nature needed this kindly relief. After indulging in a frugal supper, Eleanor gave me an ample narrative of all that had occurred dur- ing my absence. She appeared to think nothing of the danger of her present position, but reproached herself for having sent the miserable Mortimer so suddenly to his eternal account These scruples I reasoned away, by contending she had performed a  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7753-00000065"/> 128 most meritorious act for commiseration to the wrong doer is cruelty to the innocent, and the one who spares them becomes the accomplice of all their future crimes. We now assumed the, name of Stapleton. We had no clothes but what we wore, and as we did not dare to send to our home for others, on the fol- lowing night I ventured abroad and purchased a few articles of which we stood most in need. On the third day, at breakfast, while Eleanor was pe- rusinge a morning paper she had borrowed from Miss Jamart, she turned" suddenly pale. "What " she cried, accused of robbery as well as murder!  This is hard, indeed. But I trust-my lot shall not exceed my   tn"   o arr she handed me the journal. An -advertisenent it contained ran thus: "Whereas, Eleanor Willingham   alias Marcus, did, on the 15th day of Septenber instant), barbar- ously stab and murder Mr. Philip Mortimer,attor- ney-at-law, at a house where she formerly kept a milliner's shop, oll Lexington street; and whelrets, she did further rob the person  of the said Miortimer of a large sum of money, togrrether with a gold rc- peater, a  diamond ring and snuff box, and ]has fled from the pursuit ofjustice. Now, be it known, his Excellency, the Governor of the State, doth herbcly promise a  reward of two thousand dollars to anr person who shall, within thirty days fi'ol the date of this notice, discover, arrest and lodge in saf lkeeD- ing the person of the said Eleanor Willingham,'."   I perceive," said my wife, " that the compan- ions of the dead man will swear my life away if pos- sible, and their plunder of his body can no way be concealed, save by my condemnation. But, be it as it rmay, I have little fears but that Providence will protect the innocent!" I now had everything to fear for Eleanor, from the interested villainy of the witnesses, as well as from the power of the government and the resent- ment of influential .relatives. In truth, I looked upon her death as certain as her trial. Had I been owner of the first estate in Maryland, I would cheer- fully have exchanged it for a sufficient sum to con- vey my loved ones to a region of safety. But, with the trifling wreck of our fortune escape was not practicable, and at-the close of nine months from the death of Mortimer, starvation actually impended over us I I had not the abiding faith of my wife, and if I looked up to heaven, it was without love or con- fidence. As Eleanor did not dare to take in work, nor I to stir abroad for employment, our chief en- tertainment was in perusing some old folio books of history and divinity, which I borrowed from our landlady. My wife had lain down one evening with her little girl on the bed. My brain was on fire. A sudden reflection started. My death, thought I, may yet be useful to those for whom only I could wish to live. Taking down an old pistol which hung in the corner of a closet, I stole down stairs, concealing the weapon in my breast, and left the house. I was bent on something, but I knew not  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7753-00000066"/> 130 what. I had not gone far when I saw a large tav- ern opened I passed through the entry and running up-stairs, boldly entered the dining-room, where a numerous company of gentlemen sat with their wine before them. I closed the door, and producing the pistol exclaimed: "Gentlemen, I starve ; I die for want; resolve to relieve me or perish with me." They fixed -their eyes upon me; but the meagre frenzy which they saw in my countenance, held them silent. The one who was nearest directly took out his purse and presented it to me. I returned it, and putting away my weapon- "No, no, sir," I cried; "I will not take your gold, I am no robber ; but give me some trifle among ye, to keep from the grave three creatures who famish in the midst of plenty." As if by one consent they put their hands to their pockets and made up a sum of fifteen dollars. I beheld it as a mint of money, and grappling for it like a vulture, I placed it in a side pocket; and being too full to thank my benefactors, I burst into tears., and turning from them got once more into the street without interruption. Hastening home, I waked my loved one from her sleep, and telling her heaven had sent us some small relief by a friend, I placed a dollar in her hand, and asked her to send out and procure-sustenance for herself and child. Our strength and spirits recruited a little from this event, and one morning, as my landlady's Bible lay before me, a sudden thought occurred. I   breathed to God a short and silent ejaculation, be- seeching him to instruct me in what I ought to do, by the passage upon which my thumb should hap-. pen to rest on opening the book. I instantly made the venture, and found the following words: "I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against thee, and before heaven, and am no more worthy to-be called your son.  Alas I I was far from imagining at that time, 'that it was no other than my Father in heaven who called me, and who would thereby have directed and conducted me to himself. I puzzled and racked my memory to discover in what I had given just offence to my earthly progenitor, but resolved, at all events, to observe the admonition. As I was fully aware that if I knocked at the en- trance, or directly inquired for the old gentleman, I should not be admitted, I was reduced to a strat- agem. For several successive evefnings, with my- lhandkerchief tied sailor-like about my neck, and hat slouched, I limped with a counterfeit gait be- fore the house, in patient expectation of his appear- ance. At length on the fifth night of this exer- cise, the street door was opened and a male servant came out and accosted me: "Is your name Willingham, sir?" "Suppose it were," said I. "Presuming so," replied he, "I have orders to tell you that my master is well informed of your proceedings; and that if you appear again in sight  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7753-00000067"/> 132 of his windows, he will send you to jail without ceremony, and prosecute you to the extent of the We parted without another word, and I crossed over the way to a grocer's shop. The good woman who kept it, sold also the article of small ale, and I called for a mug and requested her company for a few moments. After some introductory chat, I asked a few questions respecting her neighbors. She very freely told me the history of my father and his present family; and further, it was his custom on every Monday and Friday night to repair to a club, at the Golden Horse, in Franklin street, and return about the hour of eleven. I went home satisfied with this intelligence, as I knew where to find my unnatural parent, though his last insulting message had rendered me hopeless and quite averse to any kind of application to him, We had now lived a month longer on the sum I had received in charity; were again reduced to the last shilling, and what was worse, our landlady became importunate for her quarter's rent. Iy wife had requested her to look out for some work in the line of a seamstress, and she had promised to do so, but for some reason never complied. I began now, sir, to return to my former desper- ate thoughts, and resolved to make war upon the whole race of Iman, rather than my wife and little daughter should perish in my sight ; but I reflected that it was more equitable to begin with a father, on whom nature had given me a right of depen-   133 dence, than to prey upon strangers, on whom necessity alone could give me any claim. It was Moriday night. The clock struck ten. I took down. the old pistol, and directed my steps to the Golden Horse. I patrolled near the place above an hour. The night was very dark, and no lamps were lit. At length there was a sound of distant steps, and soon after a voice cried murder I robbery! watch I! watch! -I ran in the direction of the cry, and per- ceived a man on the ground, and another in. the act of rifling his pockets. I instantly drew my pistol, and striking at the robber's head with full force, I laid him senseless on the pavement. I then gently raised the other, who was bleeding and stunned by the blow he had received. I supported him step by. step toward a distant lamp, and found a tavern open. I entered, and ordered a room with fire and lights; and desired that a surgeon should be called at once. The gentleman, whose face was nearly covered with blood and dirt, began now to recover his strength, and having urged him to swallow a dram of spirits, lhe stepped with e up stairs, leaning on my shoul- ter.  While wVsat by the fire, and a napkin and warm water were brought in, the stranger was pro- filse in his thanks for the life which he said he owed me. A service he promised to recompense to the ex- teint of his fortune. But when he had washed andt wiped away the blood from his countenance; heaven! what was my emotion Cat the sight of a visage once so loved and revered! All my injuries and resent- ments vanished instantly from my memory. I fell 12  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7753-00000068"/> 134 at his feet, exclaiming, "Is it you,;then, my father? my ever dear and lamented father!"I burst into tears, and again demanded-"Will you not know me? Will you not acknowledge your son, your once beloved John-so long-the comfort of your age and the pride of your expectations?" While I spoke, my father looked wildly and eagerly at me. He at length recollected me through all my care-worn appearance; and hesitating, re- plied : "H believe you are indeed my poor son John,"' and leaning back, fainted away. The surgeon appeared at this moment, with hiss, instruments and dressings, and perceiving his con- dition, took some blood from him, ,after which he revived and began to breathe with freedom. He then examined the wound and declared it so slight as scarce to be an excuse for keeping his room. When we were again alone, my father regarded me earnestly and compassionately, and the muscles of his face beginning to work, he broke into tears. "Unnatural that I have been," he cried, "can you ever John, forgiveme?" "All is well, father," I exclaimed, " all is well, and this moment overpays my years of anguish; it is like heaven, after passing the vale of death and mortal sufferings." After inquiring into some portion of my past life, he called for ink and paper, and first presenting me with, bills to the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars, he handed me a check. on his banker for   135 two thousand dollars.  I was about protesting against his generosity, when, "John," he cried, "I see myself already overpaid in the- thanks of that dear but meagre countenance." The reckoning be- ing discharged, my father desired me to meet him at the same tavern the following evening ; and that in the meantime he would think of settling some certain income upon me. It was now near two o'clock, and the morning bitter cold. Eleanor had long since put her child to rest, and I found her in tears by the fire, scarce alive. She started up on my arrival, her face gleaming with joy, but uttered some soft reproaches for my absence at that hour. Meanwhile she gazed earn- estly and inquisitively in my face, "John!" she ex- claimed, "what is the meaning of this? what new kind of countenance, dearest, is this you have brought home to me? God forbid that the darling of my heart should have done anything criminal." "No, no, Eleanor," I replied, A God has been wonderfully gracious to-me; He blesses me for your sake. I have seen my father ; we are happily recon- ciled, and famine and affliction shall come near us no more." After discharging our rent with the landlady next morning, I consulted with my wife whether she would choose remaining in the city, or retire to some remote district of the country, as we had now the means of escape. But reflecting on my father's tenderness for me, she joined with me in thinking it advisable to act with his concurrence; and I deter-  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7753-00000069"/> mined that very evening to reveal to him, in confi- dence, the whole history of our marriage and adventures.  Meanwhile I thought it best, in all events to secure the means of compassing our pur- pose, by getting my father's check cashed. I found that I had now little to fear from being known to any one, as-my shabby apparel and eimaciated limbs, that had baffled even the remembrance of a father, appeared a double security against all other eyes. I therefore ventured with the paper to my father's banker, Mr. Stokes, and demanded payment. "My friend,' said Mr. Stokes, "it is not two hours since a stop was put to the payment of these funds; and I was desired, at the same time, to put this letter into the hands of the party who should call." So saying, he gave me a note, which I opened with a trepidation that was turned into agony on reading the following words: "To JoHN WILLINGnHAM: Most subtle and accursed of all contrivers I It was thyself, then, set that villain on thy foolish and fond father, by whom his blood was shed and his life nearly lost. I renounce you, I abjure you from henceforthland forever. As I shall continue to disclainm any tie with you here or hereafter, so may heaven continue to preserve me from your future plots. ' RICHARD WILLINGGHAM."i On reading this note I retired from the counter without speaking a word. I got home, I know not how; for I neither knew what I did; nor considered what I was about.  I walked upstairs without per-    . ceiving thlat I was followed. But I had scarce got into my room when five or six men entered almost   along with me, and one of them, stepping amrecuy to my wife, cried: "Madam, I arrest you for murder!"       . I was stunned, but roused again in an instant Catching up a poker beneath the stove, I aimed at' a well-dressed man not wholly unknown to me, but missing his head, cut him through the shoulder to the b  rne. I then flew upon the rest and dealt my blows with inconceivable fury and quickness. I cleared the room in a few seconds; and though sev- eral shots were fired at me from the stairs, I chased them to the entry, and then returning to Eleanor, I barricaded the door. It was then she interfered, and falling upon her knees, exclaimed: "40, John, what madness has possessed you? Would you be guilty of actual murder through a rash and vain attempt to rescue from the law one whom neither God nor man has yet condemned? This were to insure the ruin you apprehend." I gazed on her speechless and motionless, know- ing she was right. Eleanor took the weapon gently from my hand, and then removed every bar and ob- stacle to the entrance of the officers. ' Gentlemen," said Eleanor, "I deliver myself peaceably into your hands; you shall find no further opposition to the laws." The officers accordingly entered the room and in a respectfiul manner ; neither did one of them offer to lay a hand upon her. ", Good God, madam!" exclaimed the chief, "Is it possible you should be guilty of the crimes laid to 12*  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7753-00000070"/> 138 your charge by that rascal whom your husband has half killed? He is carried off, and I think in my conscience, he has got his deserts ; as for the few hurts we have received, we excuse your husband, madallm, for your sake, and we think him the better man for what he did. For, in truth, imadam, you are well worth defending," "You have my thanks, sir, for your courtesy," said my wife; "C I am guilty of the death of a manl, yet guilty of nothing that I would not repeat in the defense of virtue. But, sir," she continued, with a smile, "you are likely to be troubled with more prisoners than you look for. One of them, indeed, is young, and as little meaning of harm to any one as her mother. I must, therefore, beg your indul- gence in sending for a coach; and do me the favor to accept this trifle to wash away any animosity between your men and my husband."  So saying, she place:l a half eagle in the hand of the chief, who ordered one of the others to step for a carriage. I observed the men, hardened as they were, drop a tear of sympathy, as Eleanor, with her child in her arms stepped forth; an evidence they had not wholly forgotten they were born of woman.  A cloud of thick darkness again overspread my soul, and I cursed the meeting with my father and his treacherous appearance of bounty, which had served only to bring this decisive ruin upon us. Being conducted to prison, a tolerable apartment was awarded lus, through the kindness of the warden; and the day following, I procured copies of the de-   'positionsof the three witnesses-the first of who was our own servant girl.  I then secured two learned counsel in the criminal law, but received little consolation from -their conclusions. They told me that, had my wife; been actually guilty of the robbery as alleged, she might have a chance of being acquitted of the murder, by being enabled to bribe off the evidence. But, if she was really inno- cent of the lesser charge, it then became the interest of the guilty witnesses to have her condemned on both accusations. iBeing conducted to the court- house on the morning of trial, Eleanor was extreme- ly pale, and her countenance downcast with a diffi- dence that she could not for sometime overcome. The concourse of people was great, and composed largely of the political and other friends of the de- ceased. A jarring murmur was heardc before the opening of the case, and the words innocence and impudence were alternately spoken in whispers through the crowd. According to order, Eleanor held up her right hand, and, in answer to the usual question, entered the plea of "not guilty."  A painful silence now prevailed in lieu of the former tumult. I shall not detain you, sir, with an account of the examination of the two first witnesses, one of whom had been our own domestic, and the other the footman of Mr. Mortimer. They had, as I con- ceived at the time, unusual encouragement from the court, in consequence of which glances of triumph and approval were freely exchanged between the gentry who were hostile to Eleanor, and those whose  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7753-00000071"/> - 140 sympathies were with the accused appeared forc the moment depressed. The third witness for the State was then called. He was a very genteel and modest looking young man, and had assisted in the office of the deceased. "Your honor," said he, " before giving any tes- timony in this case, I request that the two first wit- nesses be taken into custody." "Into custody!" ejaculated the judge; "Do you know what you say?" "I do know what I say, your honor, and I repea. my request, that those Who lave testified be held in confinement." "Why, friend," said the judge, " they are as you are; they are witnesses for the commonwealth against a criminal, and no man has a right to order them into custody." "I say," rejoined the youth, with an air still more determined, " that they are witnesses against innocence, against the State, and against the laws; that they are the criminals in this cause; that I am evidence against them; and I again require it of your honor, of the jury, and of all present, that they shall not be permitted to make their escape." "I am satisfied," returned the judge, " you have a hostile motive in this action. If such is discovered, you shall receive condign punishment." "Your honor," replied the witness, in a severe and sarcastic tone, "you were not placed on the bench to prejudge in any cause, no more than I was called here to be browheat and sentenced without   trial. If you find I prevaricate, I will not demur to the worst punishment- the law can inflict. But your hoinor observes I am an evidence for the State; I therefore demand to be heard in thewcause to which I amn cited; and all present shall be assured that I speak nothing but the truth. And, gentlemen of the jury, I pray you to intercede in favor of equity with. the court, and to see that these criminals, for such I affirm them to be, shall not be suffered to go free; and further, that they be instantly searched, and jall that is found about them reserved for the inspection of yourselves and the court." "Your honor," said the foreman, "I humbly conceive that no ill-consequence can ensue from searching and setting a watch over those people; their testimony is already given and cannot be inval- idated thereby." The judge, with an unwilling demeanor, turned to a bailiff and desired him to restrain their liberty until further orders. "Your honor,'" resumed the young man (his name was Edward Forrester)    "about eighteen months since I took the degree of bachelor at Prince- ton, but misfortunes and misunderstandings happen- ing in our family, I was left to be the architect of my own fortunes, and arriving in Baltimore I was engaged to read law in the office of the late Mr. Mortimer.  He grew attached to me beyond my merits ; and I began to partake of his confidence at the period I was deprived of his friendship by his recent unliappy decease." He then deposed to Mr. oc  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7753-00000072"/> Mortimer having communicated to him his designs against Mrs. Willingham, and that upon daring to remonstrate with him, Mortimer had become angry, and threatened him with the loss of his favor for- ever. "He then," continued Forrester, "told me how he had gained over her maid by a large bribe to assist him. He felt sad and unwilling to partici- pate in the attorney's actions, but I was dependent on his bounty, and really attached to him from many services he had rendered me. We adjourned to Mrs. Willingham's on the appointed day, through an intimation from an accomplice; Mr. Mortimer going upstairs, while we followed the serving-wo- man, Mrs. Ross, into the kitchen. I soon observed that the footman, whose testimony you have heard, was smitten with Mrs. Ross, and,- absorbed in con- versation with that person; so, as I found myself extremely uneasy, I left the place unnoticed by these worthies, and stealing upstairs, I placed my ear to the door where- I distinguished the voice of the attorney, and great heaven! to what sentiments was I then a witness! to what proofs of innocence of the most exalted nature! If it were not tedious I would deliver to the court, and to you, gentlemen of the jury, an accurate account of the language that en- suedl. " sHear him--hear him-was the universal cry of the audience, and he was permitted by the bench, and desired by the jury, to speak with freedom. He then repeated, in a pathetic tone, all that passed, as before narrated, between Mortimer and   my wife. But as he drew near the tragic termina- tion of the scene, I could no longer bear, he said, the piercing cries and shrieks of one in such ex- tremity. But I trembled and grew faint, and hlas- tenincg down to the kitchen, I threw myself into a chair and swooned away.  While I was in this condition and Mrs. Ross and her companion were busy about me, the fatal blow, as I imagine, was given, and the prisoner at the bar made her escape with her infant in her arms. When I came to, the woman who had placed the kettle on the stove, invited us to a cup of tea. At length it grew dark, and being all of us surprised that no lights were called for, we went upstairs, and the female ven- tured to tap gently at the door ; but as neither word nor sound was heard, she turned the handle, and looking in gave a scream, and drew suddenly back again. We then entered together, and as I was prepared, by - my knowledge of the lady's virtue, for some dreadful catastrophe, I was the less shocked at what I beheld. The floor was half covered with blood. Mortimer lay in the midst, already cold; and the fatal steel lay beside him. We stood for some time in awe; and then, with joint tears, lamented his fate. Mrs. Ross at length stooped down, and taking Mr. Mortimer's book from his breast pocket, she counted the sum of two hundred and ninety- seven dollars. She then took out his fine gold re- peater, next his gold snuff-box, and last, a large diamond ring from his left hand. Come, said she,  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7753-00000073"/> "4 your late master's silence gives consent, and we can no more be said to rob this piece of earth, than they in the mines who gather gold from the clay. If my mistress is ever taken, she must suffer death for the murder; and she can suffer no more for the robbery and twenty such matters together. So if you be of my council, we will comfort our- selves for this melancholy business, and share a prize among us that no one else had a right to, and that nobody will want. These subtle arguments prevailed speedily with Robert, the footman. I was -dispirited-I was af- frighted. I saw before me a scene of blood and slaughter; and I doubted not that, if I refused them, I should be made a second victim to their re- sentment and avarice. I pretended to value the watch at an enormous value, and that I should do well if I got that for my dividend. Mrs. Ross then went to her mistress's drawers, and taking half a dozen silver spoons, a handsome tea set, and several articles in lace and fine cambric, she laid them before us, and observed that her mistress would not call in a hurry to demand them, and that the landlord would take all if we did not share the spoils. She then made a division; compelling me to accept the watch and snuff-box. The contents of the purse were given entire to Robert, she retaining the diamond ring and the plunder of the drawers. While Forrester was giving this testimony, the foreman of the jury, turning to the bailiff, remarked,  .,   "Do us the favor to search the pockets of your pris- oners. Place what you may find in two hats, and hand them up to us." This being done, Mr. Forrester was requested to proceed. ' I have little further to say," continued he. "Here is Mr. Mortimer's watch, and here is his snuff-box. They are known beyond question to many now in court; and I bless God that I have been enabled to preserve them for the vindication of in- nocence and the triumph of virtue at this moment." Here the witness paused; but the judge exclaimed: "'Come, come, I have not yet done with you, For- rester! Tell the jury, my wonderfully honest friend, how came you to keep these articles from their lawful owners for the' long space of twelve months and upwards?   Why did you not im- mediately, or long before this, give information against those whom you so suddenly take it inrto your head to accuse? And why ^vouid you suf- fer so exceedingly a chaste and innocent lady to labor all this time under the infamy with which her character is now loaded?" To all these questions the young man merely smiled; but bowing slightly, and making a motion with his hands to two gentlemen who sat within the railing, Mr. Townsend, an upright citizen who then held a commission as a magistrate, arose and spoke as follows: "I wish, your honor, that I could as well satisfy the court, as I can the jury and others present, on 13 O   v  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7753-00000074"/> " the points you have named. The. day succeeding this fatal: affair, Mr, Forrester came -to me, and in. presence of Mr. Warfield here, a worthy neigh- bor of mine, gave adetail, almost word, for word, of what he has deposed within the past hour; he then deposited the watch and snuff-box he has ex- hibited in our care, and: did not reclaim them till early this morning. At the time of the interview, I offered to issue warrants for the arrest of the de- linquents; but Mr. Forrester most sensibly ob- served, that such a step would shut the door against justice and all knowledge of the truth; that the criminals were two to one against their accuser ; that on the slightest alarm, they would infallibly ab- scond, or make away with the effects. of: which they now felt themselves in quieti possession, or contrive. some plot to invalidate his evidence; or, probably make way with him by violence, and thus deprive this unhappy lady of the only witness of her inno- cence. But, said he, if they are permitted to enter the court, not knowing my intentions, they will have no reserve nor incentive to escape. My unexpected testimony will confound their guilt, and they may carry articles- about them which will serve for their conviction beyond any cavil. In the meantime, Mr. Forrester, Mr. Warfield, and myself were constant in our search and inquiries after the unfortunate prisoner, at the bar, that we might persuade her to stand trial, and. deliver -her- self up to justice. But all our efforts proved fruitless till the day on which she was discovered and taken.   There being no 'further evidence in the case, the State's attorney now began hi. argument for the prosecution. His theory was ingenious, but ex- tremely unfair, and after reciting the terrible loss sustained by society in the sudden and violent end of so useful and brilliant an ornament, concluded as follows: What are we offered in recompense of this fearful robbery of life and property? Why, gentlemen of the jury, we have a new and spark- ling gem--the saving of the honor of a mnilliner. But if this woman is inviolate, as we aile told, how came she to be guilty of this most horrid of all murders, before she knew to what extremity the unsuspecting Mortimer would have proceeded? How did she dare capitally to execute a gentle- man, in revenge of that for which our laws would not have confined a common porter? This woman must certainly have been a trader in blood; and her felonious intefats and maalice are fully shown in the peculiar use and inhumanity of the weapon with which she perpetrated the desperate deed. You cannot therefore, gentlemen, have any difficulty in according us, what the State claims, a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree. I will not affirm with equal certainty touching the robbery; but as she is capitally punishable on the first charge, I leave you gentlemen, to, determine the second at pleasure. Before further argument, your honor, remarked the foreman, addressing the court, permit us to examine what we have in these hats. He then pro-  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7753-00000075"/> "8 duced a long purse which had been found on the footman, and counted ninety dollars in gold. Mr. Forrester, said he, would you know Mr. Mortimer's purse? If it is the purse. of the deceased, rejoined the young man, it is of green silk, and has near the top a coronet, and the letter M wrought under it in silver twist. The very same, sir, indeed, resumed the foreman. And now let us see what Mrs. Ross might have had in her keeping. So saying, he took from the second hat a small box neatly. stuffed with cotton, in which he found Mortimer's diamond ring, 'three small gold studs, and the handles of several silver spoons. Mrs. Willingham, said he, to the accused, I imagine we have got some of your property among us. Pray, had you any mark to your silver- ware? Yes, sir, replied my wife, with a subdued voice;: an M at the top for Marcus, and a C and E below for Catharine and Eleanor. Well and truly described, madam, and --a distinguished mark in your favor. Gentlemen of the jury, cried the judge, are you prepared to retire and consult on the verdict % in this issue? Your honor, returned the foreman, the learned counsel for the State, has truly observed, we need not leave the box for the purpose you lhave named. We are already agreed and unanimous in opinion. I say, and so say we all, that Eleanor Willingham, your honor, is not guilty I The words were scarcely pronounced when the court room re- sounded with cheers, hats, caps, and handkerchie-fs were tossed aloft, and the bailiffs were powerless to restrain the enthusiasm. The triumph was caught   and echoed by the crowds without; and the acclama- tion was heard a square from the building. My wife arose, and turning to the jury box, her eyes dimmed with tears, exclaimed: I thank you gentlemen, one and all; I thank you warmly for my dear infant's and my husband's sake. I could not contain my grati- tude, but clasping my hands-God alone can reward you, gentlemen, I cried. May He forever preserve the properties, honors, and families of the worthy citizens of Baltimore from violation and insult I I then rose hastily ; I slipped out of the enclosure, and rushing up to Mr. Forrester, I caught him eagerly about the neck. I could not speak ; I hid my face in his bosom and broke into tears. He attempted to disengage himself, but I held him fast. I believe, sir, said he, you must be Mr. Willingham. I con- gratulate you, sir, with all my soul; but you owe me nothing; I barely did my duty. My noble friend, my preserver! I cried; I owe, you more than life. Existence had been my greatest curse without you. To you alone it is owing, Forrester, that I am not at this moment the most unfortunate of creation, and that I find myself the most blessed of beings. Nay, you must not hope to escape me; we never more must part; and I, and all that I have, is yours to eternity. The crowd was now wholly intent on a sight of my Eleanor, and as she left the court, attended by Mr. Forrester and myself, they made way for her on either hand, and the air again rang with shouts and acclamations. So sincere is the respect that the populace pay to virtue, and such is 13*  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7753-00000076"/> their exultation when innocence rises superior to oppression! As we were obliged to return to prison for the child, who had been left in charge of a female at- tendant, Mr. Forrester informed us on the way that he had been tempted to introduce himself during my wife's detention; but he feared that the discov- ery of any acquaintance or correspondence between us might prejudice Eleanor upon her trial, and he had therefore concluded to remain quiet until the day of trial. He also gave us some account of his family's history, and that .since the death of Morti- mer, he had bean chiefly out of employ. Having -sent for a coach, we drove home together, and Miss Jamart received us with warm    congratulations. After supper our new friend made terms with the landlady for the street or front room on the same floor with ourselves, and the arrangement was a pleasing one for all. Eleanor was now at liberty to revisit her old ac- quaintance. She became more popular than ever, and took in so much work that she was obliged to hire a girl to attend to the child. The remembrance of distress and poverty had now vanished as a dream, and I was at the very pinnacle of human happiness. Mr. Forrester was very engaging in his person and manners. We had contracted a friendship which I imagined no time would sever; and I loved him the better for his attention to Eleanor, whose enter- talnment seemed to form the chief delight of his  life. He  was, as I have said, pleasing in person,   151 and he daily became more amiable and engaging in my eyes, and yet I know not why nor wherefore I  became uneasy. Ah I are not the real evils of life sufficient? Yet man adds to them by his tendency to realize what is merely imaginary. Shall I make the unworthy confession.   I became jealous, sir; jealous of my truest friend and of the purest woman that ever blest the love of man! One evening, una- ble to restrain the growing strength of this unworthy sentiment, I betrayed in my manner an air of cold displeasure, and Eleanor, who was prompt to discern the meaning of each look, at once changed the smile which had greeted Forrester, into a cold reserved demeanor that cast a chill over any further enjoy- ment. Our noble young friend, who was both sen- sitive by nature and acute in-his perceptions, soon left us with an embarrassed mien, and on going into his room the following morning to apologize for the abruptness of my behavior, I found the following note addressed to myself: "I leave you, dearest of friends, and I leave you forever. Wretch that I am I to have brought affliction on -the only two for whom I would have lived-for whom I would have died I Heavens what a fate is mine! I voluntarily depart, and that which doubles my unhappiness is, partly to suspect that t have been guilty., Ah, fond and foolish passion! that could neither hope, nor wish, nor even accept of any kind of gratification, save the sight and society of the object of its ardor. Ah! let no man henceforth confide in his own strength. I daily beheld your Eleanor; I daily conversed  with, but I eaaw not my danger. The gracefulness of her motions, the sound of her voice hourly sunk into my soul wit h an intoxi- cating delight; and I wished, and was solicitous to become pleas- ing in her eyes, at the very time I would have taken the life of any man who had attempted to deprive you of your full right in her \E .   &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7753-00000077"/> 152 affections. This confession reaches the utmost of my fault; but from what a dream of happiness has it suddenly awaked me!" P. S.-In the drawer of my table, on the left-hand, you will find another paper, sealed and addressed to you. It contains a poor legacy, though all that could be bequeathed by-your departed EDWARD FORRESTER." I wept as I read this manly but pathetic epistle. I was agitated by, emotions of self-reproach, and with a tide of returning confidence in poor Forrcster. Would to heaven that men and angels would love Eleanor, I exclaimed, with a purity equal to thine. I found eighty-five dollars in the paper described, a most seasonable and yet unacceptable supply, as I feared from the generosity of Forrester's nature, that it contained nearly all he had on earth. Upon this slender stock, sir, we subsisted for many weary months, as I could procure no employment, and my poor Eleanor was deprived of the means of subsist- ence throught a confirmed rheumatism and general prostration of health; and the only prospect of a living which finally offered itself was suddenly andl unfortunately removed through the death of a prom- ising lad, son of a Mr. Garrett, who had engaged my services as a private tutor at three hundred dollars a year. The surgeon here arose, and bowing to Kate, re- marked : "I will not longer, Mr. Willingham, detain yourself and daughter this evening, as the hour is late, but promise you, as I am deeply absorbed in the narrative of your eventful life, that to-morrow night, and in a more comfortable abode, which I   153 shall endeavor to procure ere that time, I shall be your guest and your auditor once more; that is, if my fair friend here, inclining his head to Miss Willingham, will permit me." "The dear, kind friend," replied the young lady, "who has proved our benefactor at so trying a pe- riod, may be assured what infinite pleasure it will afford us both to have him beneath our humble roof at all times; and for your generous proposal, sir, to remove us from this home of poverty, you have the grateful thanks of father and myself." "O, do not name it, dear Miss Willingham. It is extremely painful to think you should remain here one moment, and I beg of you to regard these reverses of the past as a sombre dream, to be dispelled by the bright sunshine of returning day." The lovely features of Kate  Willingham were averted for an instant, her lips quivered with emo- tion, and her expressive eyes were suffused with tears. Doctor Sharp, taking her hand, pressed it warmly, and telling Mr. Willingham he should call at dusk the following day to introduce them to com- fortable lodgings, he hastily took his departure.  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7753-00000078"/> PHAPTER IX. THE large old rambling building, situ- ated on the Lorraine Strasse, in which the doctor had established himself during his stay in Saarbrucken, con- tained a number of excellent apart- ments, long bereft of tenants through the exigencies of war, and the worthy hostess, Carlotta Moltke, had more than once indulged in dismal sighs over their vacant and unprofitable condition. It may therefore be readily conjectured; that when at the morning meal, Doctor Sharp announced an American gentleman and his daughter, friends of his, were desirous of securing board in connection with two comfortable rooms, the great blue eyes of the good Carlotta fairly danced with delight, and the terms, for which the doctor agreed to make him- self responsible, were speedily arranged. Just as the twilight of a winter day was spreading its mantle over the quiet streets of the town, our hero, having hired a close carriage, drove to the door of the ruined tenement, and in twenty minutes the strangers were comfortably seated by a warm fire in their new home. After the introduction, the 154   warm-hearted and really entertaining hostess' who welcomed her guests with a profound courtesy, bustled about with unwonted alacrity, and very soon a substantial repast was spread before the doctor. and his friends. To say that John Willingham and his child were simply grateful for this sudden, and happy change in their condition, would be, feebly to express the profound and heartfelt nature, of their emotions on this memorable evening.-' After supper, when all were once more seated near the! genial parlor stove, Mr. Willingham, whose counte- nance plainly bespoke that he labored under feelings. that words were unable to express, took the doctor's hand quietly within his own, and in a faltering. tone remarked: "Dear sir, long knowledge of mankind has, confirmed the teachings of my youth, namely, that the character of a gentleman is; the greatest, the: most exalted of all characters. It is no uncommon thing in the world, it has been well said, sir, to, meet with men of probity; there are likewise a-, great many men of honor to be found, but a true: gentleman is what one seldom sees. Everything that he says or does is accompanied with a manner, or rather a charm, that draws the admiration and: good will of every beholder. Such, sir, without intent of flattery, this heart informs me, we have found in you. The great merit of philosophy, when it cannot command circumstances, is to reconcile us to them; and as our thanks would ill' repay you, and your nature would reject them with impatience,  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7753-00000079"/> we must be content to-nurse an inward gratitude, and not express it." 'I Yes, my dear Willingham," replied the doctor, Cyou have adopted the true philosophy ;" continu- ing with a gay smile, " and much as I have learned to love your daughter's company and your own, yet if you name my feeble merits any more, I shall run away and leave you."  "And as that must never be," said Kate, "we must even gratify you, doctor;' and now. if consis- tent with your pleasure, father will resume his little history." I think I informed you, sir, resumed, John Wil- lingham, that the only gleam of hope afforded us during the dark era I have portrayed, was extin- guished in the death of the youth, Garrett, and my noble Eleanor, continuing to decline in health, with a delicate child to provide for, and in arrears for lodgings, I was again reduced to such straits that now, sir, at this distance of time, I regard them with trembling and with horror I At this time I regarded not how mean my occupation would be, provided I might earn any kind of honest bread. Accordingly, as I rambled through town one morning in search of employment, I observed a porter in front of a hotel door, clad in a short blouse, with belt and an apron before him. Pass-. ing on, I turned into Harrison street and pur- chased a similar uniform, leaving my coat with the keeper of the place until my return. Go- ing through several streets, I came to a large   public house where no porter was in waiting. Enter- ing, I announced my position and willingness to work, at the clerk's office; and in brief, with carry-. ing messages and other light work, at the close of the day I returned home with ninety cents as my earnings. I felt a satisfaction to which I had long been a stranger, and that night ate heartily, talked cheerfully, and slept in peace. I continued this  occupation six or eight days, in one of which I earned six silver quarters. I was now engaged in one of the lowest and least lucrative employments of life ; but I was content-I was cheerful. Late on the last evening 6f my occupation, as I was on my return home and within a few doors of my lodging, I was seized and assaulted by four men, who were porters, as I found by the sequel. I struggled the best I could, and got one of the'm under me; but the rest kicked, cuffed and bruised me in a misera- ble manner. Oh! they cried--": You are a gentleman, are you? and yet you must steal into our business, and glean away the few cents by which we gain our daily bread; but' we will cure you of carrying burdens, we warrant you." They would undoubtedly have murdered me had I not feigned death, but observing that I lay with- out signs of life, they made off in haste. I got home with difficulty, and was the same night seized with a violent fever, which continued upwards of three weeks, and when I was enabled to sit up, it was in a very weak and emaciated condition. In a "  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7753-00000080"/> 158 little time I was once more able to walk about the room, and on the day preceding that on which our quarter's room rent became due, Miss Jamart, whom I always took for a fair-weather friend, and who was exceedingly avaricious in disposition, entered our apartment with a face wherein insolence, hardness of heart, and contempt of our wretched situation was but too apparent. "Mr. Willingham," said she, "if so be your name be Willingham, I suppose I am not to tell you that to-morrow is quarter day. And yet, if some people, Mr. Willingham, can't afford to eat, I can't see how they can afford to pay rent; and so you know, 'tis every bit as comfortable to starve in jail as in lodgings. But this is nothing to the purpose. I am myself but a poor woman, and no better than richer folks; yet, poor as I am, comparisons may be odious between some people and some other peo- ple; and then I don't come for charity, I come for nothing but my own, and that, you know, is the least that will satisfy anybody. If you had any- body else to befriend you but myself, you might have been. in the poor-house before this; but, as I, was saying, I can't be an only friend, an; all friends at once. And I must tell you that I hate objects.; for I have so much pity in my nature that it pains me to look at them, and, above all, I can't abide them in my own house. And so, as I told you, Mr. Constable will be here in the morning, and he will show you to lodgings that will fit you much better; and so, Mr. Willinghanrl and Lrls.   159 Willingham, if so be that your names be Willing- ham, I wish you both a mighty good morning." And away she went without waiting an answer. As soon as she was gone--"John," said Eleanor, "(our kind landlady reminds me of the wife of hon- est Socrates, whom he took for the trial and exer- cise of his patience. Ah! how cringing was this woman! how insolent is servility when it attains any power! But what, I wonder, is become of our friends the Misses Hodges? I would have sent to inquire after them, but was displeased at their neg- lect of us in our long illness. I will step there this instant, and borrow as much, at least, as will save us from the fangs of this fury." So saying, weak as she was, she left the house, but was not abroad but a few moments. On her return I observed a heavenly radiance on her countenance, from which I prophesied all man- ner of happy success. But she was silent for some time, when, looking eagerly at me, she suddenly threw herself on my breast and bturst into tears. "O. John," she cried, "I had hopes that all would be well; but all is over. Our dear Misses Hodges were not to blame; the eldest died suddenly since we saw them, and the youngest is with a dis- tant relation in the country. We have nothing further to hope nor to fear from this world. .God seems to have shut us out by every door, and will neither permit the friendship, the humanity, or charity of others, neither our own industry or in- genuity to yield us a morsel of bread."  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7753-00000081"/> 160 "Yes," I answered, "it is evident from a chain of successive proofs. I see the hand of God in all that concerns us; I will no longer struggle with His omnipotence, nor make my ignorance a sounding line for His unfathomed wisdom."  Thus it is,-sir, that frail humanity will reason in moments of des- pair, and in the absence of that holy faith, without which life would be a ceaseless curse, we cast un- merited reproaches upon the Great Being, who blesses with one hand, while he apparently chastises with the other. At nine the next morning the landlady entered, in company with two constables and two appraisers. She found my wife's work-box, the only source of her living, and gathering up our linen, our cloth- ing, our humble furniture, and a variety of articles which we would never have turned into money, she laid them  before the appraisers who, on consulta- tion, valued them at forty dollars, being ten more than we owed.  Thus we were turned out almost naked. The world, indeed, lay before us. It was wide and all-sufficient, as many an ill-fated wretch has found it, and yet nothing to our purpose. To our heart's bitter sorrow we found it as a harbor to those tempest-tossed mariners, who, in the act of blessing their good fortune, find themselves driven away on suspicion of the plague. Hopeless, weak, and faint, we took our way, we knew not whither.  We could think of no one living who would receive or acknowledge us.  With the little sum left us through the sympathy of the ap-   161 praisers, Eleanor and I, rather than perish or be dependent on charity in our native city, determined if our strength would only permit, to travel on foot to Philadelphia, carrying poor little Kate, when unable to keep up with us, alternately in our arms. The child was then three years of age, and too young to feel sorrow. She crowed with delight when the fresh air of the country first fanned her cheeks, and she felt herself roaming at pleasure through the green shady lanes that greeted us at intervals. I will not weary you, sir, with the details of the tire- some journey of nearly a week, ere we reached our destination. Suffice it that the various sums ex- pended for rest--and refreshments' at roadside inns and farm-houses made such inroads on our humble means, -tlat barely six dollars remained to procure shelter and food in the vast city for my Eleanor and Kate. Great. as the strain upon her already weak and enfeebled constitution had been to my faithful companion, no mnurmur escaped hertlips. The sweet look, of resignation with which she surveyed our small ill-furnished room displayed the same une- qualed fortitude, the same-undying affection that mlarked her whole previous history. As faith clings the more to the cross of life while the waste of waters deepen around her steps, so love clasps that which is its hope and comfort the closer, for the desert which surrounds and the dangers which harass its way. My loved ones and myself, sir, remained residents of Philadelphia for more- than three years, many times the victims of the most "*  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7753-00000082"/> 162 grinding poverty, according as numberless preca. rious positions were lost and won. At length, tired of incessant labor and no profit, we concluded with the slender, fund which our joint industry had lain by, to see if our condition might not be bettered in New York.  Now I desire, dear sir, to depict my wife as a great, not a perfect character; therefore, whilst Eleanor was a virtuous, a noble, and industrious woman, she was yet a proud one, and there is no more degraded nature than that which entertains no sense of honest pride! I love no man--I trust no man, be he priest, parson, or layman, who wastes his foolscap in foolish homilies against that exalted trait, which in the darkest, the most perilous hour, has preserved the honor of woman and the integrity of man. To Eleanor, therefore, long accustomed as she might be to lowly fare and humble apparel, fortune was yet an advantage she could not con- template with disdain, nor resign without reluct- ance. Though she cared but little for personal comfort or appearance, she nourished fond ant icipa- tions of placing her only child in a sphere of life more propitious and  freer from  the dangers of adversity than she herself had been permitted to occupy. Actuated by this laudable ambition, on arriving in New York the chief solicitude of Eleanor was to secure withl her scanty capital an eligible stand for millinery and notions, which purpose was effected in three days after reaching the city, having fortu- i . ' , i't                 .   nately heard of a vacant place on Carmine street, and in a lively neighborhood. Fortune at this period appeared to regard us with a more favorable aspect than it had for years. The autumn was just opening, the city was unusually thronged with strangers, business accordingly received an addi- tional impetus, my -loved one was kept constantly engaged, and I was grati-fied with a reporter's posi- tion on a leading weekly, the pay of which enabled me to assist Eleanor in making many little profit- able ventures, thereby adding to her stock and en- hancing the sunshine of happiness which now beamed upon her exertions. Need I say, sir, how greatly my own daily labors were lightened, and with what joy my heart was filled when I perceived once more the rose return to the cheek of my loved one, and the old joyous smile again enliven those features. Ah I sir, if the great Pericles derived all the powers of his oratory and the elegance of his taste from the example and instructions of the lovely Aspasia; and the Gracchi caught the spirit of their eloquence and the fire of their patriotism from their mother Cornelia, so, from the virtues of my own Eleanor, did I derive at this period the ambition to 3xcel in the duties of my new vocation, and the in- -entive to lavish upon her the manly affection of one who felt how truly she had been his preserver in the lark hours of the past. But alas I as the poet well )bserves:  "Who hath not known ill-fortune, never knew Himself or his own virtue."           - V ,         j 4  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7753-00000083"/> And after a brief season of prosperity the fortitude of our attachment was again to be tested in the crucible of adversity. Little more -than two years after our circumstances had taken this favorable turn, a signal calamity befell us. an one of the coldest winter nights I ever experienced, an acci- dental fire in a neighbor's house so baffled the exer- tions of the fire department, that ere the destructive element could be mastered, some nine or ten stores and dwellings, including our own, were left with their nalked walls only as a memento. We were turned, sir, into the snow-clad streets, literally ruined; for unfortunately, both my wife and myself had overlooked the renewal of a policy which had expired ten days or more previous to this sad mis- fortune. To crown the measure of our troubles, the inclemency  of the season and the exposure and anxiety of the fatal night brought on a   raging, fever, resulting in pleurisy, which confined me fully a month to my  room, causing the loss of the re- porter's position, the only dependence of our little family from starvation. We  should have been, sir, at this trying period absolutely houseless, but for the unsolicited kindness of a lady friend and customer of my wife's, residing on Prince street, a Mrs. Edger- ton. This whole-souled woman, who owned the small dwelling in which she resided with her two children,- near the age of our Kate, generously offered the use of her best room free of cost, until fortune should smile upon us once more; and in my troubled career I  have never met a truer friend.   Fortunately, too, in this exigency some two or three of the many business acquaintances with whom Eleanor had been accustomed to deal, volunteered to supply her with such goods as would be required to commence the world anew; and through this means she again opened a small establishment in the Bowery. Yet we never prospered as before; neither the exertions of my noble wife nor my own received the reward which untiring industry might well have claimed. Occasional employment as an essayist, together with a few claims for collection at a trifling commission, obtained from commercial houses, were all that cheered me during nearly three years ensuing the reverse I have named; and the cloud that darkened my path more than all this was the knowledge that the inexorable destroyer of our race, and of so many happy hearth-stones-con- sumption-had marked my beloved Eleanor for its victim. Has not, sir, bitter experience convinced its all that at every stage of life man seeks for love, yet finds none that endures. What affections are not blasted by sin, by the world's sad changes, by the treachery of feeble natures, by the force of ambi- tion, or of avarice ?  And who among us has not felt his own love-that went forth warm and gushing- falling back in an Alpine torrent upon his heart, as he has viewed the dull earth close upon remains dearer to him than life ? Brave Eleanor, prompted by a higher andholier sentiment of affection for her husband and child than for her lf, continued to struggle against the  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7753-00000084"/> 166 advances of the insidious disease, until she was warned by an eminent medical adviser that a sea- voyage was the absolute necessity, if she desired to prolong existence even for a brief season. Reluc- tantly she consented to close out her humble stock at public sale, the proceeds of which realized about two hundred dollars more than the cost of our pas- sage to Liverpool, where we arrived in twelve days after leaving the East river. Our child was now a strong hearty girl of .ten years, and encountered the winds and waves of the Atlantic without an hour's illness, as also did Eleanor, who touched the British soil apparently stronger and more cheerful than she had appeared for many months. After remaining one week in the great commer- cial seaport, and finding it afforded but little in- ducements to a stranger, we agreed to travel by railway to London, and see if my talents and in- dustry, our sole dependence in future, would not find in the great metropolis a field for their exercise. Well has it been said, " that to one of observa- tion and reflection and adequate knowledge, every- thing in London is suggestive."  In her external features we read the history of her past and the description of her present social state. O! mighty and wonderful city! a scene of real sublimity un- equaled in the world! And here, sir, I must say, unknown as I was to any living soul, amongst more than three millions of animated beings, with the two helpless loved ones, who constituted my only ties to earth, depending upon my strong will for \                      k  ..   167 bread, I felt, though really alone, amidst its moving masses, a renewed life, and less disconcerted than at any former period. For here, sir, is not only every man's house his castlq but there is an exhilarating sense of freedom not experienced elsewhere among hle habitations of men; 'whether strolling abroad, or0eated with wife and child beneath his humble roof,  ilfind none of this toiling multitude to inquire with offensive curiosity into his motives, his intentions, or his actions; whether he be a homeless wanderer, or possessed of millions in con- sols, or landed property, is equally a matter of indifference; and neither the owners of faded dresses nor ragged coats are obliged to bury themselves in oblivion for fear of inquisitive eyes or wagging tongues I In one of the many narrow streets or courts, on. the south side of Ludgate street, adjacent to the Stationer's Hall, I engaged two decent rooms with a widow of the name of Monmouth, together with good substantial board at thirty shillings per week, and remained there during my whole residence in London, nearly eight years. This locality being within convenient distance of the Temple and Inns of Court, as well as of Paternoster Row, the Strand and Fleet street, was one that saved me much tedious ramlbling through the intermediate and in- tricate avenues of the metropolis. I had' adopted, after mature reflection, the avocation of a convey- ancer and copyist, knowing there was a large field for those pursuits in the purlieus of Gray's and  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7753-00000085"/> Lincoln's Inn, for one who was industrious and obliging. It may be well to state, sir, that there is to-day nearly eleven thousand attorneys in Eng- land who practise in the courts of law and equity at Westminster, four thousand of whom    reside in London or its suburbs, and the majority of these have their offices within half-a-mile of Lincoln's Inn. The larger number of country lawyers employ Lon- don attorneys to transact their court business, and this being the law-quarter of the metropolis, both for convenience and dispatch, it is an important ob- ject for members of the bar to have their offices in its vicinity. The chambers attached to the Courts of Law are principally in the Temple and in Lincoln's Inn; those of the Courts of Chancery and Exchequer in Chancery Lane, and not a step can be taken in suits of law without resorting to one or other of these offices. Whilst suits in Chancery, as in our own country, ' drag their slow  length along" for years, it cannot be denied that in the great criminal court of the metropolis--the Old Bailey-that chief essential, speedy justice, is dealt out alike to all; and around this noted spot, and the adjacent frowning walls of Newgate, the same scene is constantly pre- sented: Crowds of merchants and professional mpn fretting at the loss of valuable time; country farm- ers, looking anxious and puzzled, and gaping rustics appearing even more foolish than ever together with numbers of small tradesmen, whose Sunday coats are evidently donned for the occasion and these, with policemen, members of the swell   mob, sneak thieves, gamesters, and abandoned females, constitute a picture more mournful than gratifying to the sensitive observer. I had been but a few days in the city, when an old and intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Monmouth and .her deceased husband, a Mr. Goodwin, of the law firm of Goodwin &amp; Morley, paid a brief visit, as he frequently did, en route from his office in Chancery Lane to his neat cottage at Camden Town. i Very thoughtfully my kind landlady, after intro- ducing Eleanor and myself, suggested to the attor- ney that I could doubtless be of valuable assistance provided his firm had need of one experienced in any kind of legal copying or conveyancing. The old gentleman, whom I afterwards found had a most lucrative practice, at once replied that Mr. Morley and himself had immediate need of a settled and reliable man, who would devote his entire time to the avocation in question, and he was greatly pleased, to meet me at a season of urgent necessity. -Thus you perceive, sir, that a watchful Providence in this land of strangers, relieved us from anxiety and want, and provided my loved wife and child with friends and a comfortable home.  The emolu- ments of my new position, after a few weeks' insigltt, reached an average of at least four guineas a week; a sum which provided genteelly for our wants, and left a surplus of three and four dollars weekly for the savings bank. My wife, after a brief inquiry, heard of an eligible academy for young misses, and at once placed our darling girl under the care of its 15  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7753-00000086"/> 170 principal, and she progressed rapidly in her studies. But I shall not, doctor, dwell unnecessarily upon the history of myself and family during the long years of our residence in London, but I will remark they would have proved the happiest and the most profitable of my existence, had not two unhappy incidents marred their brilliancy, and eventually forced me to quit its friendly shelter, to encounter again the dread spectre of poverty, from whose grasp your kindness at length released me. The first of the events alluded to was the death of my dear and faithful Eleanor, which occurred the third year after our arrival in England. Yet spare me the recital, my honored friend, of that terrible, that heart-rending scene. O., would sir, that the lapse of years could blot that wretched day from memory I But in the still hour of night, at the dawning light, at the meridian of day, in the crowded avenues of commerce, the silent recess of the forest, or, on the stormy waves of ocean, it is alike impracticable! Oh, everywhere, and at all hours, will those lovely, those cherished features haunt me, ever renewing the vivid agony of that moment, when clasping her to a breaking heart, I heard the last whispered tones of that voice scarce audibly pronounce, "I love you now as ever I I go to pray for you and our darling My heart is now too full to add one syllable to the description of this tragic event-this fearful hour of withered hopes, of severed ties, of more than death I Let me hasten through the years that in- S         *      .   1 71 tervened before our meetings to the brief recital of an occurrence which impelled me and my child to leave suddenly, and probably forever, the soil which contains the ashes of my sainted Eleanor! My daughter, as she advanced to womanhood, her minds enriched with the stores of a superior education, with every accomplishment fitting to society, and with personal attractions conceded even by those of a higher sphere in life, was quite a favorite with a large circle of friends, and with none more than the daughters of my esteemed employer, Mr. Goodwin, at whose elegant and hospitable mansion she was a frequent visitor; and it was here she received one evening, a casual introduction to Lord Villiers, a dissipated young nobleman, son of a distinguished peer, and who had-scarcely attained his majority. Young and prepossessing- in appearance, Villiers was yet old in the worst qualities of man, and in addition, had become enormously involved in debt, and it was to extricate himself from an impending execution on a cherished span of blooded horses that he sought, on the occasion named, the counsel of the eminent advocate, as his engagements would not permit him to call the following day in Chancery Lane. The free and bold address of the nobleman created a timid distrust in Kate, and she sought to avoid his glances, but it appears he became deeply enamored, and on his departure bribed the hostler who held his horse, to acquaint him with Miss Will- ingham's address. The villain's -intent was soon made manifest. By some means he had ascertained *    i        R  *    &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7753-00000087"/> that I was in the frequent habit, on pleasant even- ings, of visiting a noted coffee-house in Fleet street, for the purpose of perusing the American journals on file, and also that no other gentleman resided , beneath the same roof with Kate and myself. The Monday night succeeding his introduction to my daughter, he had watched me from an opposite court in Ludgate street, leaving the house, and tak- ing my usual course in the direction of Fleet street, from whence he knew I would not return before the hour of ten. I had scarcely passed from his view, ere he crossed and knocked loudly at the door.. Mrs. Monmouth, who kept no servant, answered the summons, and after inquiring for Miss Willingham, and leaving his name, he was admitted by the old lady and ushered into the little parlor, where Kate was engaged in answering a note from a lady friend. My daughter was somewhat surprised at this visit of his Lordship, but after introducing him to Mrs. Monmouth, courteously invited him to be seated. Lord Villiers was blandness itself, for hepossessed a certain artificial polish, a quality described by our countryman Irving, as a commonplace vivacity ac- quired by perpetually mingling in the beau monde, which, in the commerce of the world, supplies the place of natural suavity and good humor, but is purchased at the expense of all original and sterling traits of character. By a kind of fashionable disci- pline the eye is taught to brighten, the lip to smile, and the whole countenance to emanate with the semblance of friendly welcome, while the bosom   173 warms not with a single spark of genuine kinJdness and good-will. After a half hour's desultory con- versation, our landlady excusing herself, left the room for the evening, and the nobleman became more free and animated in his address. It would appear, sir, that it is the curse, of poverty and humble station to be at the mercy of rank and power I Thus, Lord Villiers, accustomed to arro- gate dominion over. his fellow-men of less fortunate position, and to insult female honor with impunity, hesitated not, as he rose to take leave, to offer a suggestion for a future meeting at the house of a disreputable acquaintance.  But the same spirit which nerved her mother's arm to strike the infa- mous Mortimer to the earth, filled the bosom of Kate as she answered the libertine: {'Lord Villiers, 'tis a merciful God alone that saves you at this moment from the fate of your counterpart at the hands of my dead mother! Were I not unarmed, I would lay you at my feet! Leave, sir, instantly, and never pollutethe threshold of my father's house again." The dissolute scion of nobility retreated before the disdainful glance of the girl, muttering as he closed the door, "I will be revenged for this." He had scarcely gone when I returned and found my daughter reclining on the lounge and weeping violently. On receiving from my child the narra- tive which you have heard, sir, my first impulse was to seek the dastard's life at once; but second thoughts impelled me to the adoption of another 15*        -  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7753-00000088"/> 174 course; although in either event, i foresaw that immediate flight from the country was the only al- ternative. My resolve, which was not communi- cated to Kate until after its execution, was to pub- licly castigate Lord Villiers in presence of his friends. With this view, having provided myself with the required means, I repaired on the follow- ing evening at a late hour to the Junior United Service Club in Regent street, a place much' fre- quented by dissipated young bloods at all hours, and where I felt assured of meeting the nobleman. On inquiry ot a pert servant in one of the corridors of the spacious building, I was informed his Lord- ship was engaged in a game of roulette in a private apartment and could not be disturbed; but giving the lackey to understand that my business was ur- gent, and backing my request with a glittering guinea, I was speedily directed to the room, and finding the  door unsecured, I entered without announcement. Villiers, with three companions of his own age, were so deeply absorbed in gaming that they did not heed my presence until I had placed my hand heavily upon the shoulder of -the former. He looked up with a haughty frown and receded a step as he noticed my stern demeanor. "Lord Villiers," said I, "you do not know me, nor do I regret your ignorance; but when I tell you the defenceless girl whom your craven tongue dare insult last evening, is my daughter, sir, you will doubtless need no further introduction." "What am I to infer," exclaimed the nobleman,   air "from your presence here?  Do you presume to threaten me?" "Threaten!"I rejoined, with a scornful smile. "Men, Lord Villiers, who are outraged in their most sacred relations, are not expected to threaten; 'tis their province to execute!" Quick as the light- ning's flash, I grasped the coward's collar, whilst I applied the raw hide, which I had concealed beneath my coat, to his back and shoulders with such merci- less severity that he fairly groaned with pain and begged for mercy! My vengeance being sated, I cast the shrinking villain from me as I would a viper, remarking to -his companions, who seemed thunder-struck and speech- less: "Gentlemen, you will bear me witness, the chas- tisement of this person is as, richly merited as its publicity." Thus saying, and amid dead silence, I left the club-house and hastened home. 'Informing Kate immediately of what had occurred, I told her to be in readiness in the morning to take the first convey- ance for Dover, with the view of crossing the Chan- nel, as a longer residence in England would be im- possible, owing to the pursuit and enmity of Lord Villiers and his connections. My daughter ac- quiesced in the opinion, and was anxious to effect her escape as speedily as possible from any further persecution at the hands of the young patrician. Our clothing, a few books, and about ninety pounds in money, were all we were able to transport to a  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7753-00000089"/> strange land;. and after taking an affecting farewell of our sincere and honest old friend,- Mrs. Mon- moutt, we traveled post-haste until we reached our point of departure from the English coast, and with an hour's detention only, found ourselves on board the packet for Boulogne, and with favorable winds soon landed on the coast of France. Passing through Abbeville and Amiens, in less than eight hours we entered Paris, the ever gay and renowned metropolis of France, where my daughter's knowledge, as well as my own, of the native tongue, soon rendered us at .home.  Before securing an eligible boarding- house, we were under the necessity for three or four days to occupy apartments which were afforded us at the hotel Bristol in the Place Vendome. Extra expense and inconvenience  were entailed on us through this fact; but considerable caution is requi- site in the choice of a boarding-house in Paris, as in many of them card-playing is indulged to a consid- erable extent in the evenings, and unwary strangers may lose sums to a large amount, and the residents of these, though persons of fashionable exterior, are frequently of very indifferent character. Bydiligent inquiry, however, we found at length an excellent English boarding-house, on the-Boulevard Prince Eugene, in the northern  part of themetrop o is. I  was compelled to submit to a short season of idle- ness, before employm ent of a suitable nature was offered me; but fortunately hearing of a vacancy in the office of the English journal , G'alignan is les- senger, I made instant application and obtaine the  post, at about fifteen dollars weekly. As our living was moderate, this sum sufficed to pay the expenses of Kate and myself; and we felt once more relieved. from anxiety and want. Yet, owing to the unfobr- tunate war precipitated by the short-sighted policy of Napoleon, our happiness was of brief duration. The horrors of the siege are known to you, sir, and to the world; and my own health as well as my child's becoming greatly impaired by reason of scanty and unwholesome provisions ; and in addition, the daily and nightly dread of incendiarism and violence from the outlawed Communists who held unlimited sway for so long a period, respecting neither God's sanctuary nor the privacy of home, told, sir, with frightful effect upon every business interest and industry. Finally, sir, after being re- duced almost to penury through loss of employment for many-months, I determined, with the few francs still at- my disposal, to remove my child from this scene of horrors, although not kno'wing what new ones we might be forced to encounter elsewhere! I need not say, sir, that it was with profound regret we turned our backs upon this beautiful city, with its treasures of art and industry ; the-most renowned emporium of literature, of fashion, and pleasure the world can boast of. Hence, with a sigh of regret, as I have said, we gazed up at its walls, its towers, and:spires, as we emerged from the Porte St. Denis. As there was no prospect of peace, security or em- ployment within the borders of the empire, our first steps were directed toward Belgium, with the   &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7753-00000090"/> view of securing some occupation at Brussels; but after fruitless efforts we were obliged to abandon the attempt to cross the frontiers in that direction, owing to the immense military forces, and the bands of stragglers who plundered and insulted defenceless wayfarers without restraint; in fact, the high-roads were everywhere unsafe, and the whole country appeared demoralized. W}Ve were compelled to ladopt a more southerly route, and after enduring incredible hardship, and performing a journey of  four hundred miles almost entirely on foot, and going more than one day and night without food, we entered German territory, and finally reached this place, and were obliged to seek shelter in the first abandoned tenement we could find, as nature could endure the fatigue no longer. We had been here, sir, two days and  nights, our last coin ex- pended, and without a morsel to sustain existence, when desperation drove me to the expedient of as- saulting a stranger in the gloom of night, sooner than permit my only child to perish of hunger. the rest you are aware of, doctor, and I trust this humble narrative of the misfortunes it has been my portion to encounter, may not havP proved uninter- esting? "It may well be said," replied the doctor, " that truth is stranger than fiction,' and the account of 'our career, from youth until the, present hour, neither with the cruel and unmerited sufferings of those -so dear -to you, would certainly form the basis of a romance, and I believe," continued he, sm'ilinl     at Kate, "that your fair daughter, sir, would be imost competent to compose such a work." ; "Ah, doctor," interrupted Kate, " you misjudge my ability, and could I even claim the talent, the trials of my dear mother and ourselves, which have been but imperfectly narrated, would dim my eyes and cause my pen to drop; and memory would bid me cease the task." "No,"  observed Willingham, perceiving his friend somewhat embarrassed for a reply, " no, I am sensible my daughter nor myself would have little taste for the repetition and exposure to the world of circumstances which, as you say, partake of the romantic, yet in our bosoms are cherished as sacred and solemn truths, Many plunge into public affairs to which they have had a previous distaste from the desire of losing the memory of a private affliction. , But with me the philosophy of manhood has so far conquered the ambition of youth, that the future presents nothing so desirable as quiet and seclusion from society; and as for my loved child, whilst I would not wish, sir, she should be other- wise than gay in temperament, yet you will observe with longer observation, that her nature is serious, thoughtful, and loving, beyond most ladies of her age; perhaps her solitary condition, deprived of a mother's care, and her habits of constant intercourse with one so grave as myself has tended to strength- en this disposition, and that happier days, which God grant may soon be hers, will effect a change,  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7753-00000091"/> but that I am afraid, dear sir, is but a far distant prospect." "Still, we must not indulge in gloomy views," rejoined his friend; " and as my duties will probably detain me in Saarbrucken for some months, I shall make an effort, with your concurrence, Mr. 'Willing- ham, to find among the influential friends I have secured in town, a position agreeable to your tastes, and one that will afford a competence while you de; sire to remain here."' " Doctor, I can never cease to be grateful, " ex- claimed John Willingham, "for your infinite kind- ness, and the truly valuable aid you have rendered the unfortunate -" "Nothing could afford us greater gratification," said Kate, "than the opportunity of remaining where a daily outpouring of our thanks could be offered to our benefactor." "No, no," exclaimed Doctor Sharp, gaily. " No thanks, for I am very confident I shall be the hap- piest of the trio by having you as residents of this old and obscure German town, where one so seldom hears his mother tongue." Thus passed pleasantly away the first evening of the strangers in their new abode. With the reader's permission, we shall reserve for another chapter an account of new scenes and incidents in the career of Kate Willingham and Doctor Sharp.    CHAPTER X.- AFTER several days of diligent in- quiry, the perseverance of Joe, as we still love to name our hero, was rewarded by ascertaining that a position consonant with the attain- ments and the personal choice of John Willingham, was open in the family of one of the most opulent and worthy citizens of Saarbrucken. This gentleman was a retired wine merchant, Mr. Casper Wittig, a widower, whose family consisted of two daughters, Maria Louisa and Barbara, with a son Ernest, a lad of sixteen years, whose educa- tion at Strasbourg had been interrupted by the events of the war, and in whose behalf the father was now desirous to procure the services of a com- petent linguist, as the young man was ambitious of acquiring the French and other languages. Mr. Wittig, who possessed a well cultivated mind, and was a man of sterling honor, had since the death of his wife some years previously, lived a retired life, devoting himself exclusively to the care and culture of his children, and the dispensation of charity,&#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7753-00000092"/> 182  which his ample fortune enabled him to indulge to such an extent, that it was the saying of the coin- X munity, he was placed in that country, as the sun I in heaven, to give comfort to all within his reach." Doctor Sharp had been introduced to this noble and valuable citizen, on his arrival in town, at the residence of the chief magistrate, and knowing his liberality and the sums he lavished upon the educa- tion of his children, he now determined to call on him in behalf of his countryman. He accordingly, after breakfast one morning, strolled out to the se- i eluded but charming suburb of the city, in which the mansion of Mr. Wittig was situated, and being courteously received by that gentleman, and making known the object of his visit, was greatly pleased to  hear that just such a man of letters as he under- stood Mr. Willingham to be, was then required for his son, and he desired that he should call and see him at the same hour on the following day.  With this pleasing intelligence for his friends, the doctor met them at supper, after the duties of the day, and archly informed Miss Willingham at the same time, "she would now have the opportunity of cultivating the acquaintance of some rivals for a eau, in the persons of the old gentleman's daughl-  ters. " Kate was too happy in the contemplation of her hther's good fortune, to heed the raillery of the routhful surgeon; and we need scarcely observe that he latter was more than. repaid by the grateful mile bestowed upon him by the fair girl for his xertions.   The next morning, John Willingham, accompa- nied by his daughter, and under the escort of our friend Joe, waited on Mr. Wittig, who was at once interested and favorably impressed by the noble appearance and courteous address of his visitor, and the graceful, refined demeanor of his child. It needed but a casual observer to discern that Casper Wittig was no ordinary man, and that adven- titious circumstances had nothing whatever to do with his superiority over the mass of his townsmen; the characteristics of a gentleman were indelibly stamped in every lineament, and he would have been the same in the humblest hut or the most sumptuous palace. True gentility is altogether independent of fortune or fashion, of time, customs, or opinions of any kind. The very same qualities that constituted a gentleman in the first age of the world are per- manently, invariably, and indispensably necessary to the constitution of the same character to the end of time.  Mr. Willingham, although twenty years his junior, at once discovered in him that congeniality of temperament which rendered an appointment in his household of greatly enhanced value, and on being introduced to his son, a noble looking and amiable youth, felt that his new position could not. be other than agreeable. The terms were speedily arranged, and a still further agreement was made that Kate should have the tuition of the daughters in their music, which had been neglected from the fact that no competent teacher had been located in Saarbrucken for many years.  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7753-00000093"/> 184 Barbara, the youngest, who was some nineteen years of age, was of a joyous and mischievous nature, while Maria Louisa, or Lou, as she was called, and who had the household management, was a stately, though beautiful woman, and four years her elder. On their introduction to Miss Willingham, they were at first somewhat distant in manner, but their reserve wore off before the interview was ended, for the artless ways and gentle voice of Kate had com- pletely won their hearts. Pardon us, gentle reader, for a brief digression. When we are forced to admit that self is the great prevailing principle in humannature, how truly refreshing is it for the pen to record instances of those in whose bosoms that odious quality has no resting place; those who live for others, not for themselves. It may be claimed as a principle in natural philosophy, that mind and matter equally harmonize in this regard. Every particle of matter, it is true, has a self, or a distinct identity, inasmuch as it cannot be any other particle of matter. Now, while. it continues in this state of selfishness, or abso- lute distinction, it is utterly useless and insignifi- cant, and is to the universe as though it were not. It has, however, d principle of attraction (analogous to desire in the mind) whereby it endeavors to derive to itself the powers and advantages of all other po:- tions of matter. But when the divine intelligence harmonizes certain quantities of such distinct parti- cles into certain animal or vegetable systems, this principle of attraction in each is overcome, for each   185 becom es drawn as it were from self; each yields up its powers for the benefit of the whole, and then only becomes capable and productive of shape, coloring, beauty, flowers, fragrance and fruit. Now, observe that this operation in matter is no other than a man- ifestation of the like process in m ind; and that no soul was ever capable of any degree of virtue or hap- piness, save so far as it is drawn away in its affec- tions from self, and so far as it is engaged in wishing, contriving, endeavoring, promoting and rejoicing in the welfare and happiness of others. Many noble instances in the sterner sex have been recorded of ex- emption from this besetting sin of our race. We may instance Leonidas and the three hundred Spartans, who devoted their lives for the liberties of Greece; of the splendid fidelity of Damon and Pythias; of the Count Vienne, the gallant Governor of Calais, and the six citizens who nobly offered themselves to the English tyrant as a ransom for their country- men; yet, while many other honorable examples mighlt be cited, it is still indisputable that we are to seek in fair woman's ranks to find daily instances of self-sacrifice, such as among men is an exception, but with women is the rule. The heart of Kate Willingham was one wherein every generous impulse combined to render her in- deed lovely and endearing to all who came within her influence. Will it then be thought srange that our suscep- tible hero became daily more enamored of his fair companion;' for such she was in many pleasant 16*  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7753-00000094"/> 186 walks, in many long eventful drives; and perhaps were we privileged to intrude upon the privacy of Kate's thoughts, we should there discover a senti- ment akin to the pervading one which agitated the bosom of Joseph Sharp. Could it be possible she should not entertain an interest in one who had pre- served her father and herself from the horrors of destitution-from famine itself; in one who had so generously devoted every effort to enhance their in- terest and happiness? She could not but rejoice in his prosperity, and when she heard his praises, and watched his career, a strange thrill of pleasure hitherto unknown  to her heart would cause her cheek to mantle, and at such moments the fair girl would ask herself, does he really regard me more than as a friend? And then as the remembrance of his earnest, subdued tones, in addressing her at their first memorable meeting, and the meaning glances of affection which since at every interview had greeted her, would be vividly recalled; how sensibly would woman's heart remind her that a sentiment more interesting than friendship con- trolled the surgeon's feelings! And shall we do Kate Willingham the injustice to believe that she was indifferent to such reflections? Al! no, she was becoming more and more sensible that what- ever untoward. reverses might yet be in store for her, that true love can no more be diminished by showers of- evil than flowers are 'marred by timely rains I And yet, fair reader, do not imagine that Kate, in giving rein to this new-born passion, was   187 actuated by sentiments of gratitude only; for she was too intelligent a girl not to know, that it is a dangerous experiment to call in gratitude as an ally to love. Love is a debt which inclination always pays--obligation never; and the moment it becomes lukewarm and evanescent, reminiscences on the score of gratitude serve only to smother the flame. Miss Willingham was also aware, and this is a knowledge ever valuable to a true woman, that in possessing the affections of our hero, she would not- be called upon to fix a character volatile and light, but on the contrary, she would have the aid and protection of a thoughtful and mature nature, long versed in the trials and sorrows of life; yet, with a sanguine, undaunted disposition, warmth of heart and high sense of honor, one ftat prosperity would not elate and corrupt nor adversity depress; and, above all, one imbued with unswerving fidelity for the object of his love. And how could Joseph, basking con- stantly in the sunshine of those' eyes, resist their influence or do otherwise than love? It was a new opening in the book of life, and one that absorbed all his thoughts; yet the surgeon had not evinced sufficient courage, or perhaps had not found op- portunity to avow his passion for Kate Willingham. , &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7753-00000095"/> CHAPTER XI. SOME   two months or more had now elapsed since John Willingham and his daughter had assumed their new posi- tions at the hospitable mansion of Mr. Wittig; and that gentleman, who had formed a strong attachment for Kate and her father, desired that his daughters should invite them to a sociable given by them to their young lady and gentleman friends in the neighborhood, and which suggestion Lou and Barbara were rejoiced to accept, adding- also, with the old gentleman's hearty consent, the names of Joseph Sharp and Jarad   W. Dillman. The occasion was one of unalloyed pleasure to all; the younger portion of the assembly, including Kate and her admirer, participating in the music and dance, whilst Doctor Dillman, John, and their kind-hearted host passed the evening hours in enter- taining conversation on the events of the war, and many-interesting reminiscences of their past lives. "Mr. Wittig," observed the doctor, "as you have the credit among the good people of Saar brucken of having amassed a well-deserved fortune in the avocation of a wine merchant, will you par- 188    "O don an inquiry as to the cause of abandoning so profitable a calling, as I have lately understood, in the prime of life?" "Your question shall be answered, Doctor Dill- man, with pleasure," rejoined Casper Wittig; "and I do not know that a more proper response can be given than a quotation from the language of that distinguished Englishman, Sir Walter Raleigh: 'Except thou desire to hasten thine end, take this for a general rule, that thou never add any artificial heat to thy body by wine or spice, until thou find that time hath decayed thy natural heat; and the sooner thou beginnest to help nature, the sooner she will forsake thee and leave thee to trust altogether to art.' For,' continued the old man, " temperance is a bridle of gold, and he who uses it rightly is more like a God than a man; and to explain these sentiments, I will add, gentlemen, that after an ex- perience and thoughtful reflection of twenty-five ^ years, I was led to the conclusion'that the affluence vouchsafed me by Providence in this injurious traf- fic, should be used To an honorable purpose, and this could be accomplished best by surrendering the source of my wealth and devoting the years which God might ordain me on earth to works of benev- olence, and repairing thus, in a measure, the injury , which the sale of this vain stimulant had undoubt- edly produced. This conclusion, as soon as practi- able, I put in execution, and have for many years derived a pleasure therefrom that the possession of untold millions could never have afforded me."  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7753-00000096"/>     190 "And a bounteous heaven,"  exclaimed John Willingham, "will ever continue to reward you, sir, for so noble a course!" "Most unquestionably," said Dr. Dillman, "such action is an honor to human nature, and your ex- ample should be followed by every right-thinking man!"  "Apropos to this subject, my friends," resumed Casper Wittig, " as I have gathered from Mr. Wil- lingham's career,'that woman has been his best friend, and I am aware from ample experience that wine is the friend of no one, I will cite," continued he with a smile, " as well as memory will serve me with your assent  a brief chapter from  Persian romance : "In the reign of Darius Hystaspes, successor to the great Cyrus, (whom you have read of in history,) Darius made'a great feast to all of his princes and nobles and the governors of his one hundred and twenty-seven provinces. And at the feast three young and princely men arose and offered to dispute for preoeminence before the august assembly; and the question was, 'what was strongest?' And the first said, Wine is strongest; and the second, the King is strongest; and the third, Woman is strong- est. The advocate for the bottle thus began: "O   ye princes! bear me testimony that wine gives and takes away according to its mightiness. It takes away the strength and capacities of nature, and gives powers, virtues and talents of its own ac- quiring. It trips up the wrestler and lays a giant   191 low; it bears the feeble and the fearful into the midst of the battle. "Wine is an opener of hearts and a revealer of secrets. It raises hope into certainty, andgives jollity and enjoyment in exchange for care. It unfolds the purse of the usurer and enriches the needy; frees the prisoner from his chain and the debtor fromViis obligation. It levels the rich and the poor, the high and the low, the king and the clown to one temper and condition. It can set companies, friends, and brothers at variance, and cause rivals and enemies to embrace Wine enlarges the narrow heart, and thaws the frozen understanding; to the silent and illiterate gives phrase and elocution. It can elevate the peasant from a cottage to a throne; for he who is drunk is as great as an emperor. O ye princes I what in nature can be stronger than that by which all the powers of nature are inverted or surpassed?" And having thus spoken, he held his peace. Then arose the advocate for kingly dominion, and- waving his hand, addressed the assembly: O0, princes I how short and sickly is the influence of wine? It passes away as vapor at the dawning; we recollect it with disgust, or remember nothing thereof. But all power that is stable or durable subsists in majesty. The king is but one man among a hundred and twenty-seven nations of men ; yet he oversees, connects, and governs the whole. His are the honors, counsels and strength of all his people. For the king they plow, they sow, and they reap and plant vineyards; for him the stars  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7753-00000097"/> 192 shine and shed influences upon earth, and the seasons change to yield the monarch variety of production s For him the fruits ripen, the shrubs and the blossoms breathe their odors ; the winds blow incense to him and the four quarters of the world pay him tribute day by day. If he cries war! it is war I The banners of blood are let loose to the wind, and the sound of the clarion kindles all men to battle. His hosts clothe themselves in harness, and range in terrible array. The forests are laid flat, the mountains shake beneath them, and neither rocks nor rivers impede the march of his armies. They trample into dust the fruits of the field and the labors of the workman; yet none ask the king, wherefore is peace, or where- fore is war? for he stands exalted in ruin, and is glorified in destruction ; his word is the bolt of irre- sistible power, and his will makes the appointment and sanctitude of law." So saying, this one sat down amid the applause of the assembly. Lastly, slow and bashful arose the young advocate for the fair, and bowing thrice around, his words went forth as the breathing of soft music: "Great, O princes I great is the strength of wine, and much greater is the strength and glory of majesty.  But yet there is a power that tempers and moderates, to which rulers themselves pay de- lightful obedience. Man is as the rough and crude element of earth, unmollified by  the-fluidity of water and light.  Heaven, therefore, sent woman- gentle, bright, and beauteous woman-to soothe,    1.93 form and illumine the rudeness of his being. The planter who planted the vineyard, and the vintner; who pressed the grape, were born of woman; and by woman alone the subject and the sovereign re- ceive existence, with all that can make existence- advantageous or desirable. She brings man forth in his weakness, and she brings him up to his strength ; he is fostered in her bosom, he is nourished with her substance, and he imbibes into his being the sweetness of humanity with the milk of his mother. Without woman, where would be the rela-- tions, endearments and connections of kindred-'the charities that bind the wide world together into oneJ family-the great brotherhood of man? She comes not against you in the hostility of weapons, or fearful- ness of power. She comes in the comfort and mild light of beauty; she looks abashed and takes you captive; she trembles, and you obey. Yet hers is the surest of all rights on earth ; for her dominion is sweet, and our subjection is yvoluntary, and a free- dom from her yoke is what* no mani could bear. There are no forms of human government that can exempt us from her sway; no system of laws that can exclude her authority. Do we not study, toil and sweat, and go forth in the darkness and put our face to every danger to win and bring home treasure and ornaments to our love? "If men seek peace,: it is to live in kindly society, with woman; and if they seek war, it is to /please her with the report and renown of their vDlor. The highest and mightiest, the lord of the manor, and. 17  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7753-00000098"/> 194 the ruler of nations, is caught in the fascinating net of his loved one, I saw her chide him in her play- fulness, and strike him in her petulance, yet he pressed the hand of her pleasing presumption to his lips; he gazed fondly and fixedly on her; if she laughed he laughed also; but if she affected displeas- ure, he spoke- and looked submission." Here ended the young orator. The monarch rose: from his throne and gave loud applause, and the roof resounded with the shouts and acclamations of the assembly. Wherefore it was decreed, by the, laws of the "Medes and Persians," that female beauty ought to govern the world in meekness, and that men owed to its power a voluntary obedience. "You have capitally proved your position," laughingly exclaimed the doctor; "and in truth, Mr. Wittig, our every day's experience, in addition to the page of history, abundantly sustains the vast influence of the fair for good." " History affords no more remarkable example," replied the old man, " than the career of the bar- barian, Peter, of Russia, who, of a numerous peo- ple, disembruted every one except himself; but the glory of this he should fairly divide with Kate, the washerwoman, afterwards the empress Catharine, who humanized the man that humanized a na- tion!" Let us now  return, gentle reader, to Kate, to Joseph, and other votaries of Euterpe and Terpsi- chore, who were meanwhile causing the spacious   i 195 apartments of the. wine merchant to resound with festive gayety. Never had -Miss Willingham   ap- peared so lovely, so fascinating, as on this evening; and her lover, who had no eyes for the gay German belles who surrounded him, was more than ever entranced with the object of his worship. The lively Barbara, who appeared to be everywhere at -once, and- whose quick perception soon discerned the doctor's sentiments, rallied poor Kate terribly at intervals, as -the opportunity of a whisper would present itself; and then, as the tell-tale blood would suffuse the countenance of the fair American, she would run gleefully away, without affording Miss Willingham the chance to recover her equanimity; and these moments of confusion would be multiplied indefinitely, as the more sedate Lou Wittig would alternate with her sister in calling the attention of her preceptress to the absent manner of Joseph Sharp when away from the side of his loved one'l And need we say at such moments, Kate would have given worlds for a quiet nook, where she could indulge alone the luxury of happy thoughts. Oh! have you never known the silent charm That undisturbed retirement yields the soul, Where no intruder might your peace alarm, And tenderness have wept without control While melting fondness o'er the bosom stole? Those pensive pleasures did you never prove, Oh, you have never loved I you know not what is love.- -But Miss Willingham was not vouchsafed this ', silent'charm " until at the close of this memorable and delightful evening, she was privileged in -the  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7753-00000099"/> 196' solitude of her own room to meditate upon the proofs afforded by her lover's attentions and the tones of his voice, and to feel within her' inmost heart the joyous conviction that she was indeed be- 'loved by him whose regard was more precious than all that rank or affluence could bestow I Nor was our hero permitted the. happiness which he had ardently hoped the occasion would confer of whis- pering to Kate the avowal of that attachment which for months it had been his paramount pleasure to cherish; but "fortune favors thee brave," and it was not long ere the desired opportunity presented itself.   CHAPTER XII. Come with those downcast eyes, sedate and sweet, Those looks demure, that deeply pierce the soul, Where, with the light of thoughtful reason mixed, Shines lively fancy and the feeling heart. i^ tHERE are men, ay, and maidens too, who are exceedingly poetical in affairs of the heart; especially so at the anx- ious moment they expect to make or re- ceive an avowal of the tender passion. Door-stoops and old-fashioned porches, kitchens and back parlors are entirely (out of the question with the forlorn swain and romantic maiden. They must have the free air and the blue expanse above them; they must seek a spot where their long con- cealed passion may escape and soar to a fabulous alti- tude. Perchance they may fancy the sunless sideofa romantic mountain, or the depths of some quiet vale; or, if they should chance to believe with Cowper, that Ic the spleen is seldom felt where Flora reigns," we may discover them wandering amidst roses and hyacinths in some capacious garden, and exchanging amorous glances in a world of perfumed beauty, ]7*        197  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7753-00000100"/> 198 But there are others, and our friend, the surgeon, was one of tilem, who prefer a comfortable chat on so important a theme in the quiet of home; and on seeking for Kate a few evenings after the one re- corded in our last chapter, he found her seated alone in the cosy parlor of Carlotta Moltke, and perusing,' with an abstracted air, an abridged edition of Ten- nyson, one of the few mementos of her deceased mother. Miss Willingham had not noticed the en- trance of any one, and colored deeply when she heard the words "dear Kate" pronounced, and the next instant the hand which had hung carelessly by her side was pressed to the lips of Joseph Sharp. Did-she disengage it from his grasp? No! for Kate was both too sensible and practical to be prudish. The doctor, as if unwilling to part with so great a treasure, did not release his hold, but drawing to him a convenient seat, gazed with fond admiration at the beautiful girl. "Forgive me, dear Miss Willingham, if my ad- dress was abrupt, will you not?" 4Assured by the faint smile which illumined her features that his question was affirmatively answered, the doctor con- tinued, while the silken lashes concealed the down- cast eyes of his listener: "Your heart may not have prompted the thought, dear girl, yet from our first painful and novel interview, the passion I have so long delayed expressing in words was kindled in this breast. Still, though doubt, anxiety and misconstruction, those. clouds of love, have never yet conspired to dim the bright sunschine of my hopes,   199 shall I confess, Miss Willingham, the dazzling vision of supreme happiness which a return of all-absorb- ing love presented to me, was too much for a timid heart, and until now I have shrank from its avowal. Tell me, dear one, in this have I done injustice to you, to myself, or to both?" As these words were uttered, her suitor sank upon one knee at the side of Kate, and still retaining her hand, pressed it passion- ately to his heart, "Let me entreat you to rise, Doctor Sharp," she exclaimed. "I would not have you kneel to one so unworthy as myself." But her lover moved not, and looking upward, seemed to seek out the fond and melting eyes, which, too conscious of their secret, turned bashfully from his gaze. "I cannot, must not rise, until those lips have sealed my fate. Ohi tell me not, dear Miss Wil- lingham, that my love has been in vain!" "I had not hoped, Doctor Sharp," blushingly replied the fair girl, her features still partially averted from the kneeling form, (' I had not hoped- how should I presume so greatly-that any feeble merits of one so obscure, a stranger, and upon the verge of despair as you found me, could have won your esteem, and above all, so great an honor as the attachment professed for me this evening." O 1O I say not so," cried her lover, warmly, c" say not so, dearest Kate. The obscurity was that of some lovely planet, concealed for a moment by the envious cloud; and it' was my grateful task to dispel the *     I  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7753-00000101"/> 20U anxiety, the despair if you will, which for a season had driven the damask from your cheek; and my admiration, Miss Willingham, not simply cold es- teem, was the greater for the disadvantage you con- tended with." "I fear, O my protector and truest friend," re- joined Kate, while tears of happiness dimmed, but did not mar the glance she bestowed upon Joseph, "that your admiration has been wilfully blind; and when you know my faults, you will seek to forget me!"I "Never, never!" was the impassioned and earnest response, "dear Miss Willingham! It may be that tne poets judged like philosophers, when they feigned love to be blind'; for often in a woman do we see what our judgment and taste approve, and yet feel nothing toward her; and often what they both condemn and yet feel a great deal! But give him whose hand anid heart are yours, the credit of that judgment and taste which could approve, and atthe same ioment stake his earthly happiness upon -the object of his choice! And now  again, ere I consent to rise, tell me, loved one, shall my entrea- ties be rewarded? Will you be mine, mine forever?" The heart of the fair and noble girl was too full of joy, of unmixed happiness to permit of words; and the hand placed within those of her enraptured admirer, gave the assent which language failed to convey!  The fair reader will scarcely require to be told with what rapture our hero regained his feet and   imprinted more than one kiss upon the features of his own-his well-won, well-loved Kate. Can we introduce here anything more beautiful, more apt, than the language of Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer: "Oh! in this thorny and troubled earth, where love, the offspring of some other world finds rarely shelter but in the wilderness and the cave-where sorrow, and disappointment, and shame, and the shadows of early death track its unguided footsteps; it is sweet to behold-it, though only for an instant, en- shrined in a temple worthy to become its refuge and meet for the homage of our vows." Joseph had now gained that richest of all earth's treasures-the love of woman! of the \one whose heart is her world. For does she not send forth her sympathies on adventure; she embarks her whole soul in the traffic of affection, and if shipwrecked, her case is hopeless-for it is a bankruptcy of the heart. * ae o t  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7753-00000102"/> -CHAPTEE      XIII.

Fortunately the cheerful tone of mind was the one enjoyed in common by Joseph and his affianced Kate; and although ,they were sensible that months, perhaps years, would elapse ere their en- gagement could be consummated in the holy sacra- ment of marriage, and that the wide expanse of ocean would in a brief period probably divide them, yet with loving and mutual confidence they would. - not consent that such impressions should dletract from their happiness whilst fortune decreed they should remain in a foreign land. The doctor, at the request of Kate, had solicited her father's approval of their union, which MAr. Willingham most courteously granted, adding his 202   203 blessingand prayers fortheir future happiness. And as Joseph was now the constant attendant of Miss Willingham in her daily morning walk to the Wit- tig mansion, the rumor of their engagement soon became general with the neighbors and friends of Kate's fair pupils; and the kindly wishes and con-, gratulations of Barbara and Lou were sincerely ex- tended to the charming music teacher, although accompanied as usual among young ladies in such cases, with abundance of raillery at the expense of Miss Willingham, all of which our heroine had schooled herself to endure with good-natured forti- tude. A fact of which the gentle reader is doubtless aware, and it is a provoking one in the case of most lovers, is that they are liable to many brief separa- tions, and however brief' they may be, do they not appear like ages to those whose only enjoyment is in each other's society? Joseph Sharp was no excep- tion to this rule, as his duties canlled him frequently to visit neighboring and distant stations comprised within the desolating theatre of war then progress- ing between the two most powerful nations of Eu- rope; and during the moments thus passed from the side of his loved one, his only consolation was the correspondence he was enabled to maintain from the Saar, the Rhine, the Moselle, and the many beautifilI and classical spots with which France and Germany abound.   , We shall be constrained to beg'the reader's indul- gence in omitting the tender passages in our hero's  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7753-00000103"/> epistles, and quote as follows from one dated at Cologne: "In my,last I promised to give you some account of the interesting sights of the Rhine. As I have been up and down it three differentt times, and as my letters would not be complete unless I gave its history, I wish it distinctly understood that it is not all original, but made up from my notes and from panoramic views of the same. *  *  *  * Upon all the known earth the Rhine is surely the most interesting river. Its origin is not exactly known, nor does a drop of its powerful waters run into the sea; for in the Netherlands it loses its name and is called the 'Wall.' It rushes down from the high  Central Alps of Switzerland, three days' journey from this place. The Front Rhine streams out from the- Toma Lake, on the east side of St. Gothard's mountain; the Back Rhine emanates from the Rheinwald-Glaciers. The whole length from Basil to Krinzen, before Rotherdam, is calcu- lated at 119 German miles.  Three hundred and seventy glaciers and 2,700 larger and smaller sec- ondary streams, raise it to one of the most majestic rivers. At Mentz it has a breadth of 1,380 feet-at Cologne of 1,212. Mentz was founded in the year "before Christ, by Drusus, the step-son of Augus- tus. A great many monuments, dating from the time of the Romans, have been found there. The construction of the Cathedral was begun in 978, under the reign of Archbishop Willisgis. The cu- riosities here are: monuments of Guttenberg and of   Schiller; railway bridge; the Palace of the Grand Duke; the armory or arsenal ; the Cathedral of Saint Stephen', the theatre; the Corn Hall, and so forth. The number of inhabitants is 42,000, among whom are 7,000 Protestants and 3,000 Jews.  *  * The beauties of the Rhine have been extolled in poetry and set forth in prose; and many, no doubt, like myself, having high anticipations, have been disappointed with their first trip upon this charm- ing river, forgetting that not so much in the river itself is the beauty, but in its surroundings, its vine- clad hills, old castles, and picturesque ruins. I need hardly state, that in these lines only the prin- cipal points of interest can be named; nor can I say what length of time should be consumed in making the trip. At Beiberich, an old place of pilgrimage on the right bank of the Rhine; an excellent view is obtained of the summer residence of the Duke of Nassau, the palace standing close to the right bank of the river. Adjoining this town are Mosbach and Elfield, the latter with 2,300 inhabitants, and a castle built in the year, 1330 by Archbishop Baldwin, of Triers.  This place also boasted of a printing- press as early as 1465, in the lifetime of the inventor, Guttenberg.   After leaving Bieberich, Hattenheim, noted for the celebrated 'Marksbrumer' wine, is passed; and further on the celebrated castle Johan- nisberg, belonging to Prince Metternich, with a vineyard of sixty-five acres, where the renowned 'Johannisberg wine' is produced. Castle Johan- nisberg was, in the year 1106, a cloister of Benedic- 18  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7753-00000104"/> 206 tines, and belonged to the Abbey' of Fulda. In 1802 it became the property of the Prince of Orange; in 1805 Marshal Kellerman received it as a present from Napoleon, and in 1814 Prince Metternich re- ceived it as an imperial Austrian fief. At the foot of the Rheingan extends the town of Rudesheim, also famous for its wine. The Low or Bromser Cas- tle, a rough and rugged heap of rocks, originates from the time of the Romans. At present it is the property of the Count of Ingelheim. Behind it rises the Upper or Roosen Castle, an old obelisk-like tower. It belongs now to Count Schonborn. The ruins of Ehrenfels are seen from this point. This castle was built in the year 1210, and destroyed in 1689 by the French. Nearly opposite the river Nahe, which enters the Rhine at this point, upon a rock of quartz in the middle of the Rhine stands the celebrated Mouse Tower. In the middle ages it was a tower for receiving customs or tolls, and was rebuilt in the form of a ward tower in 1856, serving as a warning station, where, by means of signals, a ship sailing down stream is warned be- times when at the Bingerloch, that a ship is ap- proaching from below. "The Bingerloch is a rapid gush of the stream, close concentrated by powerful rocks, the enlarge- ment of which has now and then been tried by all sorts of work since the time of the Romans till the present day. The last stone-breakings took place under the reign of Frederick William the Third, King of Prussia, from 1830 to 1832. A monument   207 erected on these broken stones on the left bank has preserved this event for posterity. 'The Mouse Tower, according to a superstitious legend, was the insecure resort of a treacherous Bishop, who:, as we say in America, created a 'corner' in corn, and invited the -poor to partake of his stock on hand without price; but getting them into his barn closed the door and set it on fire. An army of mice driven from the barn by the conflagration, took the matter of revenge into their own hands and made an attack in force upon the Bishop, who, to escape from the threatening danger, fled to this tower on the Rhine. But the mice were ' t6o many' for him, and effect- ing an entrance to the tower they gnawed the flesh ,from his limbs! "On the left bank we have Bingen, which the dying soldier of Mrs. Norton's poem had quite a 'weakness' for. It is situated at the influx of the Nahe into the Rhine, the western frontier of the Hesse Darmstadt-country, at the foot of :the Rochus Mountain, where one sees the ruins of the ancient fortified castle Klopp in which Henry IV. was im- prisoned in the year 1105. Upon the summit of the mount stands the chapel of Rochus, a structure known to the Romans. "New Rheinstein, on the left bank, is a residence of Prince Frederick of Prussia; its castle is men- tioned in the year 1279. Castle Souneck, on the left bank, built A. D. 1015, by the Archbishop Willingis, of Menttz; destroyed by ,the Emperor Rudolph; rebuilt :in the- fourteenth century-, is now  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7753-00000105"/> 208 the property of the King of Prussia and his brothers. In the river opposite Bacharach, on the left bank, is located the ' altar of Bacchus,' a large stone only visible in certain seasons. I was told that its appear- ance was the forerunner of a good vintage, -which, it is said, is apt to be true. The cause of its appear- ance is low water, the effect of a want of rain; and a dry season is apt to be favorable for grapes. Loretoe, a very powerful and high rocky mount, 420 feet high, is well known on account of its legend. Further on upon the left bank are seen the ruins of Schonberg Castle, once the birthplace of a powerful and famous family. It was destroyed by the French in 1689. In the year 1713 the family expired. The castle and the estate belong to Prince Albert, of Prussia. In this castle, if tradition tell the truth, dwelt seven beautiful, rich, amiable, and accom- plished sisters, daughters of a good-natured old Count, who was not at all anxious to get the girls married off, but allowed them to ' receive company,' and use their own judgment in making a selection. Of course, young ladies such as they were, having such a nice home, and being allowed to do pretty much as- they saw fit, were not without plenty of gentlemen friends, who would often drop around of an evening and spend a few hours, drink the old gentleman's wine and smoke his cigars. Getting used to this sort of life, these cavaliers naturally enough concluded it would be pleasant always to live in so agreeable a place, and thought of proposing to the maidens; but so equally had these seven   209 fair creatures dispensed their sweet smiles, that no one of the many suitors could boast any particular favor received. Every one of them did his best to make an impression, and it is stated that considera- ble rivalry existed among them. The young ladies, taking advantage of the feeling among their friends, practiced some rare jokes on the ardent youths, of whom quite a number had offered themselves and been rejected, going off and marrying other girls who were more anxious to get husbands. However, at length the maidens appointed a time, stating they would then select husbands, and requested a full attendance of their suitors in the marble hall of the castle upon that day. Such a throng as was assem- bled in that apartment at the appointed hourl Every knight had on the best suit of clothes his tailor could prepare, and made the best possible appearance. After waiting a considerable length of time without any signs of the entree of the fair nymphs, the gentlemen began 'to grow impatient; and as time wore on, and hour was added to hour, their anxiety became fearful. At thisjuncture sounds of merriment from without attracted their attention, and upon going to the windows they discovered a skiff quitting the shore, in which was seated the seven sisters, who, with loud laughter, bade the gentlemen farewell. Curses, not loud, but deep, were uttered by the victims of this duplicity, and, as one man, they rushed to the water's edge, where they witnessed a scene the maidens had not calcula- ted upon. The boat struck a rock and went down, 18*  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7753-00000106"/> 210 the fair ones with it; and from the water there im- mediately arose seven rugged rocks-which I noticed in the river at this point while the water was low. These are called the ' Seven Sisters.' C Soon after the ('Seven Sisters' we pass Lurley, on the right bank, with its famous echo; and-a little further on, St. Goar, on the left bank, beautifully situated. And in the immediate neighborhood is the most extensive ruins on the Rhine-that of Rhein, fels-formerly a powerful fortress ; this was built A. D. 1245, and was blown up by the French in 1794. Sternberg, also called the Temple Court, is a ruined Gothic structure. In the valley is the cloister of Bornhofen, with a Gothic church. This is a much frequented place of pilgrimage, especially in the month of September. And now, after so long a letter, may I not, 'dearest,' subscribe myself, your own,                JOSEPH." The surgeon was not unfrequently the hero of an exciting or amusing adventure in the course of these long official journeys by land and water. On one occasion he was sent to the front near Paris; and being personally acquainted with the commandant of Saarbrucken, was provided with a royal sleeping car for the trip, which would take him a week or more ; and the conductor received orders to allow no one in the car but himself. At the different towns and stations along the line, the soldiers and citizens observing the royal conveyance, gathered around to obtain a glimpse of the supposed princely passenger, and he could hear anxious inquiries as to who was j  *    2" inside. The conductor would tell them one of the princes, but he did not know which. Our hero, discovering his new and unexpected honors, determined to make the most of it, and re- ceived the salutes and presentation of arms with all the dignity due to his :royal station I Arriving at each station he was sumptuously provided with eatables, champagne, and regalias, at the expense of the government of which he was ihe presumed heir. At Nancy and other towns he Was waited on by military officials with :hats off, who placed their troops at his :service; -but he would politely bow from the car-window, thanking them for the gener- Ious offer, and to prevent the detection of his repub- lican origin, would inform them he was suffering with a headache, and preferred to be left alone!  This excuse, however, but increased the delicacy of his position, as he had some of the chief surgeons thrust upon him, who, after examining his pulse, tongue, and so forth, gravely pronounced it a case of fatigue from the journey; and he was immedi- ately'loaded with prescriptions; smelling salts, et cetera; and one officer was so considerate as to tele- graph to Meaux that one of the royal family was coming, that he was sick, and to have one of the best surgeons to take charge of him at once! Doubt- less the words of the great dramatist- "If it be a sin to covet honor, I am the most offending soul alive-" recurred vividly to the doctor's memory at'this mo- ment; and he promptly decided not to complain of  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7753-00000107"/> headaches in future. To his dismay, when the train reached Meaux, he found a corps of surgeons, with several general officers and a body of cavalry and infantryin line to receive him! It was now evi-   dent that regal blood was to be tested; that he should be obliged to dismount, and that to be re- ceived as a prince was inevitable! The door was swung open, and he was assisted to alight'by a division commander on either side, at the same mo- ment a royal salute from a park of artillery shook-  the earth and filled the air with clouds of smoke I The unfortunate surgeon was half dead with nervous trepidation, as he was assisted into an elegant ba- rouche drawn by four white horses, with a guard of twelve mounted men prancing around him.  Being driven to the princely residence, he was entertained wish due honors during his brief stay; but being careful after his departure not to assume again the royal mask for fear of some unpleasant denouement, he was allowed to pursue in elegant obscurity the remainder of his journey.   CHAPTER XIV. ALTHOUGH at this period the gay capital of France was closely be- sieged, and the ingress or egress of individual passengers was a matter of strict scrutiny, yet the doctor, being within five miles of Paris, had determined on entering its gates; and accordingly starting before dark the evening of his arrival at headquar- ters, he traversed the distance on foot, and passing the outer guards without detention, arrived at the inner fortifications at 7 P. M., where he was taken in charge by the guard and conducted to the head- quarters of the commanding officer as a suspicious character. Being asked where he was from, he re- plied, " America, and the city of Baltimore."  One of the officers present addressed him in English: "If you are from Baltimore, you can speak better English than French ?" "I can, sir," replied Joseph. "Ah then, I will see if you speak truly. I have been in that city myself !'" He was then plied with questions regarding that metropolis, to all of which prompt answers were  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7753-00000108"/> 214 returned; and he was then questioned as to his bus- iness in Paris. He rejoined, that he desired to see the minister, Mr. Washburne. Guards were then placed over him for the night; and next morning, being escorted to the office of the American amlbas- sador, he asked for Mr. Washburne in a manner indicating that he wished to pay his regards to that official, although Ihe had never met .him. He was told by the attendant, zt hat Mr. Waslthurne was alone in an adjoining apartment, pointing to it. The -doctor entered the room, followed closely by the guard, and after the interchange of a few words with the minister, the latter, with the remark, ' I will take charge of the visitor myself,' dismissed the soldiery, and turning to Joseph, said: ' You are in no trouble, are you?" "No, tsir; only in being brought here. under escort.'  The minister remarked, he had risked his life in entering the city at such a time, and advised him to act discreetly. After a lengthy conversation the 'surgeon took :his leave, promising to seek the pro- tection of the ambassador if he got into trouble. Joseph Sharp remained eight days in Paris, visit- ing, among other ,placesa, -the celebrated Imprimerie Imperiale, or government printing office, a place- frequently overlooked by travelers, and yet one of the greatest curiosities of this renowned seat of the arts. Nine hundred and fifty persons, including over three hundred females, are constantly employed here for ten hours daily. --In the revolution of 1830   215; a mob, including many printers from other offices, broke into the establishment and destroyed the.- steamn presses, thinking thereby to enforce a return to hand labor. Inthe centre of the chief court is a fine bronze statue of Guttenberg, its pedestal adorned with bas-reliefs illustrating the progress of civiliza- tion through the art of printing. Everything con- nected with typography is here combined under one roof. When the Holy Father, Pius VII, in the time of the first Napoleon, visited the office, the Lord's Prayer was printed and presented to him in one hundred and fifty languages; and before he re- turned to his carriage he received a copy of the col-  lection ready bound I The expense of this- office is 5,000,000 francs annually. The surgeon made his exit from the city with considerable difficulty, but finally arrived: within the lines of the Prussian forces, and taking his royal car proceeded to Strasbourg, stopping a day and even- ing at Epernay with the renowned champagne manufacturers, Roussillion &amp; Co., being permitted to explore their immense vaults containing fifteen millions of bottles of the wine I What an exquisite image-may we name it par parenthese-is that which Mortimer Collins, the Horace-of our time, conjured up in one of his poems, when he speaks of his two loves-the blonde and the brunette-and ex- plained his apparent vacillation by the neat surprise that champagne was the blonde and " the charming brunette was Burgundy." From Trier, on the river Moselle, our hero wrote .  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7753-00000109"/> his loved Kate a sketch of the leading places of interest on his route from the French capital to the city of Strasbourg, of which we wili furnish the reader an abstract: "I propose in these lines merely to sketch the route by which we arrived at the late seat of war from near Paris. ' We' is used not so much as a trav- eler's right as a social privilege. The plural pronoun indicates not only the objective individuality repre- sented by the author of these lines, but also another, who during the journey was a genial companion, Dr. Dillmnan, with whom you are acquainted. We skim lightly and smoothly over sixty-five miles of the Paris and Strasbourg railway, and reach the town of Meaux, situated on the river Marne. Why; does the student ask, as we approach this unpre-  tending station-Can we see the church of St. Etienne from the train? It is because within that l sacred shrine lies all that is mortal of Jacques Beringe Bossuet, the great bishop who wrote the Discourse Sur 1'Historie Universelle, and who was, perhaps, the greatest amongst that group of preachers who made their utterance part oT the litera- ture of France.  In the choir of the church a white marble monument testifies to the reverence of the people for the memory of a man whose creed was that of humanity, and the story of whose life be- longs to the universal history of which he was the interpreter.  On we go, gliding swiftly by the sloping hills on which luxuriant vineyards rear their grateful crops, until my thoughts are again turned   to the works of civilization, for the name of Chateau Thierry is shouted in our ears. Again your lover strains his neck to get a glimpse of something, for he remembers that here was born Jean de la Fon- taine, who wrote the Fables Choisies, with which, in former days, school boys in knickerbockers and school girls in (what were they) pantalettes, were familiar. Next we pass by Chalons and Epernay, through miles of that barren country which bears 'the glorious vintage of champagne.' Nothing will grow but the vine in the hungry, chalky soil of the arrondisement of Marne, from which we get the white wines of Sillery and Epernay, made by a curious paradox from the blackest of grapes. Hav- ing now traveled one hundred and forty-four miles, we reached Bar-le-duc, so called because it was formerly the capital of the Duchy of Bar, now the department of Mense. It was founded in the 10th century by the Duke of Lorraine, whose fortress stood in the upper part of the old city, and was destroyed by Louis XIV. To French juveniles (the name of Bar-le-duc is one full of (sweetness and delight,' as its manufactories send out a large con- tingent of the commodities known to the youths of America under the classical term of clollypops.' Six miles further on is Vitry-le-Francais, situated on the right bank of the Marne. This, though by no means a large town--the population being -about 8,000-is one full of interesting features. The streets are wide, straight; and clean, provided with wood pavements; there are twenty-seven fountains &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7753-00000110"/> 218 from which streams run through all the avenues ; and the public square is planted with lime trees. Over two hundred and twenty miles has the iron- horse now borne us, when we reach Nancy. This town once stood a terrible siege from Charles the Rash, Duke of Burgundy, and was reduced nearly to famine when relieved. The little church of Bon Secours was built to commemorate the event. Here lived the Dukes of Lorraine, who were buried in the church of the Cordeliers. At the time of the revo- lution, when the French people abandoned their holy religion and worshiped the vile goddess of reason, the remains of these princes, who had done the State some service, were dragged out of their graves and buried in the cemetery of the town. After the restoration the bodies were restored, and now rest calmly in the church, where every day orisons are raised to heaven for the repose of their souls. Stately buildings have been erected in every part of the town, and its square will rival those of any departmental town in France that I have seen. In the centre of the Place Royale is a statue of Stan- islaus, ex-King of Poland and Duke of Lorraine, to whom Nancy is indebted for its principal architec- tural beauties. Twenty miles further on is Luneville, where in 1801 was signed the treaty by which the Rhine was made the limits between France and Germany. And now we approach ,the end of our long, but by no means weary journey, for the speed of the engine slackens as we enter the terminus at Strasbourg--three hundred and twenty-one miles   219 from the capital of France. This city is strongly fortified with a garrison, in time of peace, of about 6,000 soldiers. It is noted for its cathedral, the spire of which is 474 feet above the pavement, or 112 feet higher than St. Paul's in London. It is con- sidered a master-piece of architecture. The clock in its lofty tower is peculiar. A statue erected to the memory of Guttenberg, in the year 1440, is an object of considerable interest. The Emperor Napoleon made Metz his headquarters; but Strasbourg has been the scene of stirring incidents in his very event- ful career. Here it was that in 1836 he gained over Col. Vaudrey to his cause ; and here he planned the scheme by which he aimed at once to attain the object which he did not accomplish until twelve years later. - Here, too, he was imprisoned, and only re- leased to be told by every newspaper in Europe that his hope of ever ascending the throne of France was the dream of an enthusiast. How utterly false this and similar predictions have iroved, it is needless to say. I shall be with you in a few days, returning to Saarbrucken by way of Luxembourg, Thionville and Metz; and meanwhile, remain, love, your true affianced, JOSEPH. '   :        &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7753-00000111"/> CHAPTER XV. He is blessed in love alone, Who loves for years, and loves but one. THROUGH love of adventure and also at' mischief, our hero, before taking leave of the south of France, met with a temporary mishap on one occasion.: Being on foot, and in company with Doctor Kessler, of Berlin, he entered a hotel in the small town of Borveaux and ordered dinner.  Whilst waiting for the meal to be served he deter- mined to have some amusement; accordingly, al- though he knew the landlady to be a rank Prussian, he said to her, with a mysterious air- "Madam, I know  you are a true French lady. Please tell us all you know about the Prussians in this section. We are French spies, and want to find out all we can." His companion was thunder-struck, and spring- ing o this feet tried to assure the good lady that they were not spies, and remarked to the American that they would get into trouble. 220 1   5Z1 Having finished the dinner, they resumed their journey, but before they had gone half -a mile saw three soldiers hard on their tracks. Very soon-they had one on each side of them and one in the rear. The doctor tried to convince their captors that they had only indulged in a little bit of pleasantry, but they would not be convinced, and marched the un- lucky physicians back. They were taken before the tribunal to be tried for their lives! The affair now began to assume a serious aspect; but the American having all his papers with him, and the Prussian surgeon finding some acquaintance among the officers, they were released, but not un- til they were placed in a little office, four by four, and fumigated with chloride of lime, to prevent them from taking the Rinderpest. Joseph thought it fortunate that the adventure terminated with no more serious consequences than a short detention, a strong fumigation, and an addition to the length of the Journey. More than once, ag at Saarlouis and other towns, the doctor, being unknown to those in command, was under the unpleasant necessity of suffering tem- porary imprisonment in guard-houses; yet, know- ing that these annoyances were the common experi- ence of civilians when journeying in time of war through a country overrun with contending forces, his happy spirits were not dampened by such inci- dents. No trait of character is more valuable than a good temper; like flowers springing up in our 19*  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7753-00000112"/> pathway it revives and aids us. Whilst kind words and looks are the outward demonstration, patience and forbearance are the sentiments within. It has been said that it requires less philosophy to take things as they come, than to part with them as they  go. Be that as it may, life is ever what we make it! So let us ever call back images of joy and glad- ness rather than those of grief and care, for though  the latter sometimes mav be our guests to sup and dine, let them never be permitted to lodge with us. Our hero would at intervals permit himself to be mo-  mentarily vexed at the conduct of the excitable and blundering Prussians, and the undue exactions of military law, as well as at the dishonest practices of tradesmen, to which all strangers in a foreign land  are occasionally victims, owing to their partial i- norance of the coins in circulation, through which source they frequently are defrauded of their just change in the settlement of accounts; yet he dis- covered, as have most men of the world, that good deeds will shine as bright on earth as the stars of  heaven, and that by uniform courtesy and returning good for evil he escaped much imposition that he would have otherwise endured.            "There is no dearth of kindness In this world of ours; Only in our blindness, We gather thorns for flowers." The penetration of Doctor Sharp enabled him to - liscern another important truth through the means forded him in this journey of mingling wi-h all v   R     n wit all   classes, namely, that the graces of humility, of charity, of true virtue, were not likely to be en- hanced by the results of the sanguinary contest of which he was the witness; for those whom       war had placed in authority, were haughty and utterly regardless of the rights of those beneath them. Let it not be supposed that the great are above tempta- tion and that the world has nothing further to- ex- hibit for their seduction. When it can be made evi- dent that to humble the spirit of man you ought to place him in authority; that to convince him of personal defects and infirmities you ought to enclose him with sycophants and servile dependents; that to make him temperate you should seat him at the table of Lucullus; and that in order to humanize his disposition you should remove him    as far as possible from a s.ense of the miseries of his fellow- creatures; when, to cure a man of distempers inci- dent to his nature, you would place him in- the midst of adventitious contagion-then, and not till then, will wealth, station and power be productive of reformation and virtue in man. It is not possi- ble that sensual appetite and spiritual ambition will cease and abate on gratification or indulgence. The spirit of man is a deathless desire; its cravings can- not be satiated till it is possessed of some object that is adequate to its nature; and as this world has no such object to exhibit, gratification only serves to provoke to further desire, or sink him into utter de- spondence. This is the moral that was intended by the philosophers, when they fabled that the son of   &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7753-00000113"/> 224 Philip broke into a' passion of tears on finding that no more worlds remained for him to conquer. The surgeon readily perceived that by the chances of war, the poor were daily becoming poorer, and the rich, richer; that everywhere, true merit, in humble garb, was overlooked, but that arrogant pretension was reiwarded with the title of prince, and courted next to majesty itself. Few have the discernment to perceive in the beggar the lineaments of the prince, or in the prince the lineaments of the beggar or slave; yet history ofttimes records that the slave's progenitor was an emperor, and the prince's ancestor a pauper. The illustrious Cardi- nal Campejus happened to have a dispute with the Duke of Modena, and the altercation rose high. "Do you know," said the Prince, in a passion, Cc that your father was no better than my father's swine herd?" "I know it full well," coolly answered the Car- dinal, "and I am persuaded that, had your high- ness been the son of my father, you would have con- tinued of: the same profession to this day." \   CHAPTER XVI. ONCE more, after imprinting a passion- ate kiss upon those lips, and with his arm encircling the waist of Kate, did our hero seat himself to while a delight ful evening away in discoursing of the scenes and incidents of the past, and in planning the future so soon to dawn upon the lovers under widely different- auspices with the billows of the Atlan- tic and perchance long weary years to divide them. The noble girl did not repine, but nature would not permit the tears to be restrained, with which her features were bathed as she buried-them in thebreast of her afianced lover; and memory recalled the many happy moments they had enjyed together; then pictured to her the sadness of the farewell so soon to be spoken. 1Now that she was to part from him for an unknown period how sensibly were re- called the many watchful acts of kindness with which in the intercourse of social life her lover had so often gratified her; those words and tones, ges- tures, looks, by which affection is won and preserved Unless it be the final separation of mother and child, no adieu between mortals brings with it the same 225  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7753-00000114"/> 226 sorrowtul, unfeigned, heart-rendingfeeling, as the one of those who have plighted to each other the vows of life-long love. Then it is, to use the homely but expressive phrase-the heart is in the mouth.- So felt Kate Willingham as the thought of a sad but inevitable farewell obtruded itself, as some dread phantom, to her vision ; yet sorrows, like joys, must find mitigation; and the kind, reassuring tones of her betrothed one, as he kissed away the sparkling drop upon her cheek, at length pacified the sweet girl's emotion, and again she glanced up at her lover's countenance with that smile of affection which to him was the light of life. Spring, with its welcome voice, had now arrived, and the memorable struggle of two hundred and ten days' duration in the fairest portion of Europe, was finally ended. Joseph, who was obliged to visit Berlin before returning to his native land, having completed the requisite arrangements in a few days after his return to Saarbrucken, now took final fare- well of those nearest and dearest to him. We shall, however, forbear the details of the parting scene, and state that previous to leaving his post of duty he was presented the annexed certificate: DR. J. SHARP: The undersigned Commission take leave to tender you their thanks for your activity and endurance in the treatment of the sick in the Reserve Hospital at this place, from October 10th, 1870, to the present date. [Signed]   KING'S RESERVEI HOSPITAL COMMTSSTON. SAARBRUCKEN, May 4, 1871. This honorable testimonial, under date of Berlin,   227 May 15th, was acknowledged and endorsed by Gen- eral Von Roon, minister of war and marine. On his route to the capital of Germany, the sur- geon visited Coblenz, to bid adieu to his many friends, and subsequently halted with the same view at Bonn, Cologne and Wetzlar, continuing his journey by way of Giessen, Marburg, Cassel, Magde- burg and Potsdam, to Berlin, where he engaged quarters at the Metropolis hotel, Under den Linden. tic remained eight days in the capital, visiting every place of interest, including Charlottenburg and the environs; and was constantly under escort of surgeons and others whom he had met upon the- battle-fields of the late war. Whilst viewing and passing through the Royal Palace one morning, he suddenly encountered the Emperor himself, who stopped and asked him if he was not the doctor who had charge of his hospital in Saarbrucken, where the summer palace is loca- ted, and being answered in the affirmative, the Em- peror told him that he had not forgotten his prom- ise, and "you will hear from me when you are home in America." Our hero gratefully thanked the monarch for his kindness, and the latter, ex- tending his hand, expressed his wishes for a pleas- ant trip to his native land, and then bade him fare- well. , From Berlin the surgeon now departed for-Bre- men, visiting Brandenburg, Hanover, and other im- portant towns on the route. Remaining two days in Bremen he had the pleasure of meeting his friend:  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7753-00000115"/> 228 Doctor Dillman, who waited to see him off for Lon- don. Leaving Bremer-haven for England, he ar- rived safely in London, after encountering a stormy passage; a large number of lady passengers who were on board being ill in consequence, and keep- ing the physician constantly employed in attending to their wants. During his stay in the " great me- tropolis," Joseph stopped at the Caledonia Hotel, Adelphi Terrace, in the Strand, near, Charing Cross Station, his arrival being duly chronicled in the evening editions of the same date. While engaged at dinner on his first day in town, eight physicians, representing Guy's, St. Barthol- omew's, and Johnson's Hospitals, whom he had met at the seat of war, drove up to the hotel in an open barouche, and being accompanied by two American surgeons, they inquired for the prince. They were informed that there was no prince at the house; but the visitors insisted that he must be there. Again they asked if no gentleman had ar- rived of the name of Sharp-Dr. Sharp, of Balti- timore, U. S. Being answered in the affirmative, one of the party exclaimed. in a tone of surprise: '"Is it possible you have a prince in the house and do( not know it?" The surgeons then maintained the jest by drawing up in column, with their backs to the wall of the vestibule, and as our hero issued from the dining room, with their hats off, they gave him the military salute with the right hand, ad- dressing him simultaneously as prince. To explain this conduct of the worthy medical gentlemen, we   229 will observe that it is customary on the field of battle for surgeons to salute each other with titles, such as emperor, king, prince, duke, and so on, and as such titles are common in Europe, the proprietor of the Caledonia now thought that Joseph vvas an American of regal claims, and began apologizing for not showing him greater attention, promising him the best room at his disposal, and other civili- ties. But the doctor politely interrupted and in- formed him he was no prince-that it was simply a battle-field honor to which he had fallen heir. In company of these facetious friends, Joseph vis- ited Hyde Park, Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's, and other noted features of London, including the College of Surgeons, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and many of the magnificent hospitals of which the metropolis can justly boast, such as Chelsea, Green- wichi, Guy's, and the Royal Hospital of St. Kath- erine, founded in the year 1148, by Queen Matilda, wife of King Stephen. The splendid Custom House, with its front of five hundred feet on the Thames, and the world-renowned Tower, where tradition tells us the ancient Briton, the Roman, the Saxon, and thc Norman, each held their hours of revelry in the olden time, and whose walls, could they speak, would tell a tale of horror, unequaled and incredi- ble, were also inspected; and last, though not the least exciting, the noted Derby races, yielded a day's amusement. And having thus enjoyed several days amnidst the ever interesting scenes of London, the doctor parted from his kind friends with regret, an l 20              -  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7753-00000116"/> 230 proceeding to Southampton, went imediatel  on oad the teaer for Baltimore, and home, " sweet hoe.                   sweet CHAPTER XVII.

Doctor Dull had unquestionably never accepted those eminent Grecian models, Themistocles and, Lycurgus for exemplars; for the former, considered as the greatest of heroes, not he who conquers, but who saves; not the man who ruins, but the one who erects; and the latter, who might have assumed the sceptre, aspired to a much more elevated and durable dominion over the souls, the manners and conduct of his people and their posterity. He pre- vailed upon the rich to make an equal distribution of their lands with the poor. He enjoined them to feed in common on simple and frugal fare. He for- bid all gorgeousness of furniture and apparel; and in short, he endeavored to suppress every sensual and selfish desire by' injunctions of daily exercise, hardship and toil-a patient endurance of pain and a noble contempt of death. Far from entertaining sentiments so exalted, the views which in youth he- had cherished regarding poverty and plebeianism, were so deeply rooted that his intimate associates would at times become pained and disgusted at his want of charity as well as good sense. Indeed, the lines which preface the present chapter were singularly applicable to this unworthy member of a learned profession; for " sound and fury, signifying nothing," illustrated his entire career. Dull, the reader may remember, had never been burdened with a surplus of brains, and the specula- *  , .

On his arrival in Baltimore, the city press published glowing accounts of his late expe. rience and adventures in Europe, whilst hi ol friends, together with numerous deputations of old man citizens, welcomed him with enthusiasm. A few days after reaching the city, the testimonial promised by the Emperor, arrived in the form of a splendid gold medalwith suitable inscription tet iring tothe meritor.     I  ption testi- fying to the meritorious services rendered by the recipient in the late Franco-Prussian war as a - pital Surgeon. This was presented to Joseph at his residence, on which occasion the' different lodges of the German Order of the Black Knights, the tep- tasophs and others, numbering over eight hundred' men, marched in procession with torches, and hon-   233 orec the surgeon with a grand serenade. After the presentation of the medal by the Grand Master of the -Black Knights, the Grand Chancellor of the Order made the following remarks:  DR. JOSEPH SHARP:-We meet here this evening to celebrate and confer upon you the highest honors that can be conferred upon earth to any individual. You, of all the American surgeons, stand alone in receiving this honor; and you alone are the only native American that has ever been so highly hon- ored by hs majesty, the Emperor of Germany. We know that his majesty'does not confer such high honors upon any one unless he has merited it, and then very rarely. It must be well known to him that the person so rewarded had rendered most val- uable services to his government or subjects, for which he feels it his duty to confer some mark of distinction. And we American-Germans, once subjects of his majesty, feelTproud, very proud, to enjoy this privilege in the name of the Emperor of Germany, to confer these honors upon a native son of America. In the future we and every German in America will ever feel proud to take you by the hand for the distinction you have this evening re- ceived from the Emperor of our Fatherland, in presenting this medal in presence of so vast a mul- titude, who have assembled to bear you testimony that they appreciate the faithful services you have performed as a surgeon in the hospital and upon the field of battle, and that you have earned the token which I have the honor to place upon your 20*  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7753-00000118"/> 234 breast, by saving the life's blood of many a poor soldier during the late war in our native land. You letft your country, your home, your all, to Cross the mighty ocean. The high - and oble spirit which prompted you in that undertaking guided you in all your duties, and brought you into the favorable no- tice of every surgeon in the army, and to his majesty, Doctor, in conclusion, you will please accept our heartfeIt gratitude for the services you have rendered and which will be endorsed by every German in America. I now order three cheers for Doctor Sharp., Which being given with a will, a brother physi- cian, in behalf of our hero, then replied as follows: GENTLEMEN:-Allow me to return thanks on be- half of my medical friend for the touching senti- ments we havejustheard expressed by your Grand Master and Chancellor. I know the recipient's sentiments well enough to say that joy and gratitude at this moment swell his heart at this kindness this ovation, given by you as representatives of the Fatherland. Hadl the brightest 'jewel from the golden land fallen into my friend's hands it would not please him as much as does this emblem be- stowed by the august sovereign William as recog- nition of his services in the cause he espoused in e ark hou,  and whose recognition he now highly esteems. I imagine his heart at this mo- ment swells with delight to know that the mighty "ruler of millions" has seen and recognized his efforts and sacrifices, made not in expectation of   235 honors like these, but simply to aid the right with- out knowing whether it would lead to sunshine or darkness, prosperity or adversity, trusting alone to the God of justice ; and now after the thunders of war have ceased he receives this golden token grate- fully, and will keep it far above all tarnishing influences. From my heart I thank you for the thrill of joy you have sent through our breasts this evening by your happy illustration of the fact that there is a contagiousness of good as well as of evil. As we pass down the stream of life the remembrance of this unexpected ovation will remain as a green spot in our memories as long as life endures. The surgeon now resumed practice under happy auspices and in the same office he had vacated the previous year. - Applying himself with unremitting ardor to the toilsome and responsible duties of his noble calling and with the confidence and esteem of the community, Joseph had now but one drawhack to complete happiness, and that, need we say, was the absence in a far-off land of his own loved-, Kate. It had been arranged at Joseph's departure from Europe, that Mr. Willingham and his daughter were to return to Maryland the following year, if their little means at that time would permit, and the union of Kate and her lover was as soon as practicable thereafter to take place; and it was also understood that after completing the tuition of Mr. Wittig's children, which w ould require about two months' additional time, the father and daughter would during the remaining period endeavor to * .      A i ' *   &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7753-00000119"/> oecure a living in Paris, where, after a long reign of anarchy, law and order had been once more re stored. - Prom' the French capital, Iate was to write Josephl Sharp, furnishing their address so that they might correspond henceforth by steamer almost weekly, and it was this aniously expected  missive thaft the surgeon was now daily looking for Vith the absorbing interest which the heart of a  lover only can experience. 1ieanwhile he was gratified with the reception of  a  leigthy letter from his old and sincere friend, the Philadelphia surgeon, Dr. Dillman, of which we furnish but a brief abstract: ' Certainly if I were settled down and enjoying a lucrative private practice in so pleasant a city as Baltimore, as I know to be your good fortune I  should not long forego that solemn and divine duty of all, to humble tlemselves before the hymeneal altar. Yes, I should select one from among the numerous virtuous, noble-minded and whole-souled ladies of that city. * * * *  * ' Ilaygreat emphasis on the term virtuous-inasmuch as I still (as you doubtless well remember during our close intimacy ins E urope) highly appreciate that noble ittribute or- inherent quality, not only in woman, but man likewise; for why in one rather than in ;he other It 'was for this'feature in your character hat I so highly appreciated your companionship ' nd society during our labors and travels in Europe, nd for this cause I went from Berlin to Hamburg v meet and bid you a final adieu prior to your ' mee an  bi yo                   -   sailing for London. ;* * ' * * I trust you still entertain sufficient confidence in the virtue of our female population to venture to select from among the very large number you may meet, some conge- nial mate, to clip and smooth for you the ragged edges of life's stormy pathway" *! * * *  CHAPTER      XVIII', WE must now for a brief season cross once more the broad Atlantic. The period had arrived when John Willingham and his child were to part from their valued friends, the Wittigs, and from the hospitable roof of Carlotta Moltke, beneath which they had passed many months of quiet and'contentment, to open a new chapter-in the volume of the unknown future. To 'Mr. Willingham it was a solemn moment, for the bitter past with its cruel lessons had taught him the trouble with which a stranger has ever to contend in procuring employ, and his slender means would not permit him to -subsist but few clays without it. Casper Wittig and his family bid adieu to the   &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7753-00000120"/> Americans with  unaffected emotion and with  sincere wishes for their future happiness. Miss Willingham  glanced back with streaming eyes as with her father she hurried from  the little town whose citizens had treated them  with unit form kindness, and her thoughts did not recover their usual cheerful tone till after two days of rail- way travel she found herself again in the splendid avenues of?aris.  avenues of Paris.  Fortunately for the travelers, who disliked the noiseand expense ofa public hotel, they found excellent looms at the same house on the Boulevard Prince Eugene, in which they had formerly resided and  whose hostess was much pleased to welcome them back.  Many changes had occurred in the gay capital since their former visit, and desolation was the pre- vailing feature in many quarters, yet perfect non- chalance marked the manners of its citizens who  seemed to feel as of old, that "Earth has but one Paris," and were as ready for fun and frolic as in the days of "Louis the Magnificent." The soil of la Belle France was now destined to be that on which John Willingham  was to receive the most important and gratifying intelligence of his event- ful career. But we mlust allow KIate to communicate this to the gentle reader in her own words: BOULEVARD PRINCE EUaENE, NO. 95.  PARIS, August 8, 18--. My Dear Betrothed:--0O how my -heart bounds to coLrem unai te good news; to tell you I will soon be with the one I love  st I Now do not smnil, for remete r this is but a woman's  missive; and they are so foolish. Will you not outive me, and     I will commence aright? But oh!I must first whisper that these past months, spent far away from the side of my loved one, have been the longest of my life Now to resume. We reached this gay, this beautiful metropolis July 17th, and I have delayed these lines a fewdays beyond my intention with the hope of saying that father was again employed, and he was becoming quite disconsolate at his want of success, when the day before yesterday he ran to me with the following notice in Galignani's Messenger: "If this advertisement meet the eye of John Willingham, a citizen of the United States, formerly a resident of Baltimore, Md., supposed to be now in Paris, be will confer a favor and hear something to his advantage by calling at the office of Drexel, Harges &amp; Co., rue Scribe, No. 8." Need I say how overjoyed dear father and myself were at this announcement. He at once sought a gentleman attached to the American legation here, whom he had formerly known in Lon- don, and in his company visited the banking house above named, where he was handed a letter, which on opening he found to be from grandfather in Baltimore, a most affecting document, (but too long to copy,) naming the death of his wife (father's step- mother,) and urging him to return to his native city, where all past differences would be reconciled. A letter of credit upon the bankers in father's favor for five hundred dollars to pay his expenses home also accompanied this; and we are now prepare ing to leave for Philadelphia in the American line steamer of the 10th, and trust to meet one whom you know in Baltimore, not later than the twenty-fifth of this month. Is not that nice In the short time we have been here father and myself have visited many places of attractive and historical interest, places rarely noticed by the mass of English and- American travelers who run to this vast ancient metropolis, which is the real capital of Christendom, race through the halls of the Louvre or the Tuil- eries, promenade once or twice the fashionable Boulevard des Italiens, and then return home 'to report they have seen Paris! Dearest, they could spend half their days in it and know but little of it. We devoted one day to the three leading and very picturesque cemeteries of Pere Lachuise, Montmartre, and Mont  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7753-00000121"/> 240 Parnasse. To the great Cathedral of Notre Dame we gave another day; and I wish I had talent to depict its grandeur and trace an outline of its history for the fifteen hundred years its walls have resounded with praises of the Redeemer I , We also attended divine service at St. Louis, St. Gervais, St. P'ierre, and other noble temples of God. Amongst the very beautiful envi- rons of the capital we have not overlooked St. Cloud, St. Denis, Versailles, and Vincennes, with its old stately and renowned for- est. Seven centuries since, Philip-Augustus enclosed the forest with a wall, and one hundred years subsequently, St. Louis fre- quently administered justice under an oak in its midst I To the right of the ancient palace of the French monarchs at Vincennes stands the powerful Donjou, once a royal residence, but since the time of Louis the Eleventh, used as a State prison, where many celebrated characters in history have been confined, includ- ing Henry of Navarre, the Prince of Conde, the Duke de Beau- fort, Cardinal Retz, Mirabeau, and the Duc d' Enghien, who was shot and buried at the southeast angle of the Donjou, March 20th, 1804. You perceive "Cara Mia," I have but inci- dentally named myself in this rambling epistle; and is not this right? How can one whose thoughts- are ever with the absent dear one, bestow them upon herself? So, reserving for the happy hour in which we are so soon to meet, the privilege of alluding to her, so unworthy of your love, I have now only to add in conclusion the name of your own     KATE. How the heart of our hero was thrilled at the re- ceipt of this intelligence; hlow  his eyes sparkled with joy ; how he almost danced with ecstasy at the thought of so soon clasping Kate Willingham to his :breast; and how he pressed again and again the lines of the sweet girl to his lips, are fair sub- jects for the reader's imagination I We shall not attempt to describe them.   CHAPTER XIX. Reason's whole pleasure, all the joys of sense, Lie in three words-health, peace and competence. POPE. N the parlor of a princely residence on l inden avenue, sat a gray-haired man, upon whose brow the cares and apxie- ties of more than seventy winters had left indelible traces. His keen restless eyes were fixed upon the rich carpet of the apartment, whilst the fingers of his right hand tapped nervously the table at which he was seated. At length, after a second hurried glance at the morning jour- nal, which had fallen at his feet, he exclaimed in a low sad tone-"My punishment is not yet ended; and this suspense is just I Yes, yes I 'tis but too well deserved I Yet this delay; why is it? My ad- vices tell me that the lost one has been found, and that he would embark in the next steamer, and she is now days over due? Oh God!" and the old man started from the seat and hurriedly paced the room, ' Save my injured child from more misfortunes, and do not turn coldly from my prayers, my tears, 21         241  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7753-00000122"/> and my repentance- Oh I do not suffer me to sink into the grave with this great crime unpardoned, and with the horrors of unavailing remorse to usher me into the unknown future. O do not I do not!" and he sank again to his seat, with his face buried in his hands. The slightest sorrow for sin is sufficient if it, pro- duce amendment; and the greatest is insufficient if it do not. The old man whom we have above introduced, had often'promised: inwardly that he would at to  distant period make? ample; amendment to the one whom withoult proper inquiry he; had driven from  his home more than! twenty years since., But unfor- tunately for the success of this intention he had  united his destiny late in life to one ever ready to encourage, the folliesa of age, as others; will the vices of youth; one, unacquainted with the rules of de- corum, or the laws of morality -:'one who would not suffer himi to. profit by experience,, nor even to con- sult the propriety of a bad character;: in short, one who would insidiously instruct the aged mer- chant), that life was no more than a dramatic scene, in which the hetro, should preserve, his consistency to the lasts and that as he had lived without virtue, he must die without repentance!  This bad adviser, the companion of his bosom for eighteen years,i hoping to survive her senior partner and to inherit done his ample; estate, taught that self-love is the notive to all human actions. Now all actions are justly held good or evil, base   or honorable, detestable or amiable, merely accord. ing to their motives; but if the motive is the same to all, there is an end at once to the possibility of virtue-the cruel and the kind, i'e faithful and the pelfidious, the prostitute and the patriot are reck- lessly confounded together. This was the malign influence which during so long a period had, as we have seen, controlled the course of Richard Wil- linghaul. His mind busily absorbed in past events, the merchant had not observed the sound of the- door-bell, and it was only when the servant an- nounced a gentleman and lady in waiting that he was aroused from his reverie, an d he signified they should be admitted, A tall and commnnandng look- ing stranger, apparently of- five and forty, on whose arm leaned a beautiful, girl attired in plain yet for- eign garbs entered the richly furnished drawing- room, and for an instant appeared as if hesitating  bo advance. But the pause was scarcely perceptible ore the stranger in a ttone of sincere emotion cried, ' My father I do youanot know your long lost son?" and at the same moment clasped him warmly to his breast, A long unbroken silence ensued.  The aged father's frame trembled with -emotion, and bears trickled down the furrowed countenance half Doncealed upon the arm of his noble son. The fair girl who had been a motionless witness of the inter- vow, now knelt at the feet of :her father and grand- ire (for such they were,) and gazed up with stream- ing eyes and clasped hands. ), 'twas a scene worthy of Ra"phael or Vandyke; for where does !  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7753-00000123"/> 244 earth afford a more lovely or touching subject than filial affection? At length, he whom the reader has ere this recognized as John Willingham, led the old man gently to a lounge, and seating him with Kate beside him, introduced her as his daugh- ter and only child. The grandfather looked long and wistfully into the eyes, now beheld for the first time, as if memory were endeavoring, to recall the features of one long since passed away; and then turning to his son, he exclaimed, "Yes, yes, my long lost, wronged and faithful boy I she has indeed the smile of your own dear sainted mother t that true parent, who would have shielded you with life itself from the oppression of your unnatural father;" and clasping his grandchild to his heart, he cried: "Let me make amends to you, my sweet child, while heaven spares my gray hairs, for the wrongs inflicted on your father!" Kate Willingham,   whose gentle nature was deeply affected by these words, could only return thanks by a  grateful smile, whilst imprinting a kiss on the cheek of the repentant grandsire and placing her hand in his. Addressing his son with more composure, Mr. Willingham said: "In my letter which reached you, John, at the Paris bankers, I endeavored briefly to explain my conduct in withdrawing my affection and my aid some fifteen years ago, after you had nobly risked your life to save my own; and you will understand that your step-mother's influence, may her ashes rest peaceably, on that and other extraor-   245 diLary occasions of your life, was the only excuse of my unworthy vacillating course toward you; yet since her death I have sometimes thoughts that the engrossing, selfish nature of a mercantile career, had contributted to destroy my better nature--a curse not unusual with many business men." "No! my honored sir," interrupted John Wil- lingham, "do not offer this injustice to the enno- bling profession of which you' are a member;: for -surely we have constant evidence that our most charitable and public spirited men are recruited from: its ranks. To a certain extent your reflections are just; yet nothing is truer than this,: that new mines may be opened, dear father, and hidden trea- sures may be discovered ; gamesters may win cash; conquerors may win kingdoms, but all such means of acquiring riches are transient, while commerce and industry are the natural, the living, the never- failing fountain from whence'the wealth of this world can alone be taught to flow." "Your views, my dear son," resumed the old merchant, "evince sagacity and research, and I shall abandon the, discussion, for if my experience enabled me to refute you the happiness of this mo- Ient would not warrant' theeffort; and now let me secure the only true pleasure which this life. can longer afford me, by bestowing: upon you, and,- tlhis dear child as a home, the mansion, blessed by th e event of this day; and when God shall termi- nate lmy few remaining days you will find be- queathed to you the reward of my long yearsof 20*  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7753-00000124"/> 246 application and toil; and this which constitutes. you sole heir, I feel is but a poor restitution for all my indifference and neglect 1" "My dear parent!" exclaimed - John, whilst he took his father's hand, and tears of gladness filled ' his eyes, "I never craved aught but your blessing in the long years we have lived apart; but for my darling child's sake your kindness merits my grati- tude and my prayers which you shall ever have!" We shall not dilate further upon this first joyous interview of a reunited and happy family. The question has been asked, from what stranger can you expect attachment if you are at variance with your own relations? Although much latitude may be permitted in responding to this apparently natural inquiry, and many men have found their best friends among strangers, yet family dissension is ever to be deplored, and its sad consequences can only be realized by those who have had the unhap- piness to be its victims. Hence, the. peculiar plea- sure we derive in the narration of the happy event just described; and the reader will doubtless imagine that equal gratification filled the heart of Joseph Sharp, when as a delighted and welcome visitor at the mansion of Mr. Willingham, on the evening of the same day he sat with his arm encir- cling the waist of his long absent one, and gazing with rapture into her beaming and joyous counte- nance. And oh, love who can tell the grandeur of thy triumphs?   24T "I could have loved you-oh so well; The dream that wishing boyhood knows, Is but a bright beguiling spell, Which only lives while passion glows; But when this early flush declines, When the heart's vivid morning fleets, You know not then how close it twines 'Round the first kindred soul it meets l Yes, yes, I could have loved, as one Who, while his youth's enchantments fall, Finds something dear to rest upon, Which pays him for the loss of all!" Before taking leave our hero archly remarked: "Yet now, my little Kate, that you have become an heiress, will you not forget the poor surgeon of Saarbrucken!"  ' But Kate Willingham, placing her hand upon his lips, quickly rejoined, "Did not the poor surgeon give me my life? Can I give you anything greater in return?" "Only your love!" "You have it!"
