No matter what business or what pleasure took me, I once, not long ago, went to Colfax. -Whisper it not to each other that I was seek- ing a foreign appointment through the influ- ence of my fellow Hoosier, the late Vice-Presi- dents of the United States. O no, I didn't go to the Hon. Schuyler Colfax at all; but I went to Colfax, simply, which is a little dingy town, in Clinton County, that was formerly called Midway, because it is half way between Lafay- ette and Indianapolis. It wasn is a place' of some three hundred inhabitants, eking, out an aguish subsistence, maintaining a swampy, malarious aspect, keeping up a biJious, nay, an atra-bilious color, the year round, by suck- ing like an attenuated leech at the junction, or, rather, the crossing of the I. C. &amp; L., and the L. C. &amp; S. W. railroads. It lay moulder- ing, like something lost and forgotten, slowly rotting in the swamip. I do not mean to attack the inhabitants of  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8053-00000005"/> 8   A BOOK OF HOOSMER MOSAIC. . Colfax, for they were good people, and deserved a better fate than the eternal rattling the ague took them through from yearns end to year's end. Why, they had had the ague so long that they had no respect for it at all. Ive seen a woman in Colfax shaking with a chill, spanking a baby that had a chill, and scolding a husband who had a chill, all at once-and I had a dreadful ague on me at the same time! But, as I have said, they were good people, and I suppose they are still. They go quietly about the usual business of dead towns. ) They have "stores " in which they offer for sale calico, of the big-figured, orange and red sort, surpris- ingly cheap. They smoke those little Cuba sixes at a half cent apiece, and call them cigars; they hangs round the dept, and trade jack-knives and lottery watches on the after- noons of lazy Sundays; they make harmless sport of -the incoming and outgoing country folk; and, in a word, keep pretty busy at one thing or another, and above all-they shake. In Colfax the chief sources of exciting amusemnt are dog fights and an occasional row at Sheehan's saloon, a doggery of the regular old-fashioned, drink, gamble, rob and fight sort-a low place, known to all the hard bats in the State.   m       WTWAS SHE A BOY?     9 As you pass through the town you will not fail to notice a big sign, outhanging from the front of the largest building on the principal street,. which reads: ," Union Hotel, 1865" From the muddy suburbs of the place, in every direction, stretch Back muck sIamis, for the most part heavily timbered with a variety of oaks, interspersed with sycamores ash, and elms. In the damp, shady laby- rinths of these boggy woods millions of lively, wide awake, tuneful mosquitoes are daily manufactured; and out from decaying logs and piees of fermenting leaves, from the green pools and sluggish ditch streams, creeps a noxious gas known in that region as the double rend,  high  pressure, forty hoss power quintessential of the ager!"- So, at least, I was told by the landlord of the Union Hotel, and his skin had the color of one who. notwithstrnding what I  have said, "Colfax, in summer, is not wholly without attractions of a certain kind. It has some yellow dogs. and some brindle ones; it has some cattle and some swine; it has some swallows and some.- spotted pigeons; it has cool, fresh smelling winds, and, after the- water has sufficiently dried out, the woods are really glorious with,  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8053-00000006"/> 10  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. wild roses, violets, turkey-pea blossoms, and wild pinks. But to my story. I was sitting on the long veranda of the Union Hotel, when a rough but kindly voice -said to me: "Mornin', stranger; gi' me a light, will ye " I looked up from the miserable dime novel at which I had been tugging for the last hour, and saw before me a corpulent man of, p'r- haps, forty five years of age, who stood quite ready to thrust the charred end of a cigar stump into the bowl of my meerschaum. I gave him a match, and would fain have re- turned to Angelina St. Fortescue, the heroine of the novel, whom I had left standing on the extreme giddy verge of a sheer Alpine preci- pice, known, by actual triangulation, to be just seven thousand feet high, swearing she would leap off if Donald' Gougerizeout, the robber, persisted further in his rough addresses; but my new friend, the corpulent smoker, seemed bent on a little bit of conversation. "Thankee, sir. Fine mornin', sir, a'n't it " "Beautiful," I replied, raising my head, elevating my arms, and, by a kind of yawn, taking in a deep draught of the fresh spring weather, absorbing it, assimilating it, till, like a wave of retarded electricity, it set my nerves Ilk   WAS SHE A BOY?      I in tune for enjoying the bird songs, and filled my blood with the ecstasy of vigorous health and youth. I, no doubt, just then felt the- burden of life much less than d(d the big yel- low dog at my feet, who snapped lazily at the flies. "Yes, y es, this 'ere's a fine morniu'-juli- cious, sir, julicious, indeed; but le' me tell e, sir, this 'ere wind's mighty deceitful-for a fict it is, sir, jist as full of ager as a a corn is of -meat. It's blowin' right off'n ponds, and is loaded chock down with the miasm--for a fact it is, sir." While delivering this speech, the fat man sat down on the bench beside me there in the veranda. By this time I had my thumbs in the arnl holes of my vest, and my chest ex- panded to its utmost-my lungs going like a steam bellows, which is, a-way I have in fine weather. "Monstrous set o' respiratory organs, them o' your'n," he said, eyeing my manoeuvres. Just then I discovered that he was a physi- cian of the steam doctor sort, for, glancing down at my feet, I espied his well worn leather medicine bags. I immediately grew polite. Possibly I might ere long need some quinine, or mandrake, or a hot steam "bath-anything for the ague!   &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC8053-00000007"/> 12   A BOOE OF HOOSIER MOSAIC$. ' "' Yes, I've got luns like a porpoise," I re- plied, " but still the ague may geg me. Much sickness about here, Doctor--a--a------ what do they call your name      *. ' Benjamin Hurd-Doctor Hurd, they call me. I'm the only thorer bred botanic that's in these parts. I do poorty much all the prac tice about here. Yes, there's considerable of ager and phthisic and bilious fever. Keeps me busy -most of my time. These nasty swamps, you know." After a time our conversation flagged, alnd the. doctor haviug lit a fresh cigar, we smoked in silen-ce. The wind was driving the dust along the street in heavy waves, and I sat watching a couple of lean, spotted calves making their way against the tide. They held their heads low and shut their eyes, now arnd then bawling vigorously. Some one up stairs was playing "' Days of'Absence?' on a wretched wheezing accordeon. "There's a case of asthma, doctor," I said, intending to be witty. But my remark was not noticed. The doctor was in a brown study, from which my words had not startled him. Presently he said, as if talking th himself, and without taking the cigar from his mouth: "'Twas just a year ago to-night, the 28th   *WAS SE A BOY      13 day of May, 'at they took 'er away. And heql die afore day to a dead certainty. Beats all the derned queer things I ever seed or heerd of." He was poking with the toe of his boot in the dust o the verandla floor7 as he spoke, and ateling a glance at his face, I saw that it wore an abstracted, dreamy, perplexed look. ' What was your remark, doctor?"I asked, more to arouse him than from any hope of be- ing interested. Hum!--ah, yes," he said, starting, and be- ginning a vigorous )uffing, % Ah yes, Iwa  cogitatia7 over this matter o' Berry Young. Xever have been able to 'count for thatno how.  Thinik about it more an7 more every day.  Whats your theory of it?" Cant say, never having heard anything of it " I replied. "Well, I do say!  Thought everybody had hearn of that, anh ow! It's arale rormance a  reg'lar mystery, lsir. It's been talked about, and writ about in the papers so much 'at I sposed 'at it was knowed of far and wide." "I've been in California for several years past," I replied, by way of excuse for my igno- rance of even the vaguest outline of the affair, whatever it might be. 2  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8053-00000008"/> "  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. "Well, you see, c leetle more'n a year ago a gal an' her father come here and stopped at this 'ere very hotel. The man must 'a been som'res near sixty years old; but the gal was young, and jist the poortiest thing I ever seed in all my life. I couldn't describe how she looked at all; but i everybody 'at saw her said she was the beautifulest creatur they ever laid eyes onto. Where these two folks come from nobody ever knowed, but they seemed like, mighty nice sort of persons, and everybody liked 'em, 'specially the gal. Somehow, from the very start, a kind of mystery hlung 'round 'em. They seemed always to have gobs o' money, and onct in awhile some little thing 'd turn up to make folks kinder juberous some- how 'at they wasn't jist what they ginerally seemed to be. But that gal was fascinatin' as a snake, and as poorty as any picter. Her flesl looked like tinted wax mixed with moon- shine, and her eyes was as clear as a lime- stone spring--though they was dark as  night. She was that full of restless animal life 'at she couldn't set still-she roamed round like a leopard in a cage, and she'd romp equal to a ten-year-old boy. Well, as mought be ex- pected, sich a gal as that 'ere 'd1 tract attention in these parts, and I must say 'at the young   WAS SHE A BOY?      15 fellows here did git 'bonillable sweet on her. Casionally two of 'em 'd git out in the swamps and have a awful fight on her 'count; but she 'peared to pay precious little 'tention to any of 'em till finally Berry Young stepped in and jist went for 'er like mad, and she took to 'm. Berry was r'ally the nicest and intelligentest young man in all this country. He writ poe- try for the papers, sir-snatchin' good poetry, too-and had got to be talked of a right smart for his laruin', an' comptishments. He was good looiun', too; powerful handsome, for a fact, sir. So they was to be married, Berry and the gal, an' the time it was sot, an' the, day it come, an' all was ready, an7 the youlng folks was on the floor, and the 'squire was jist a comlmeneilu' to say thi3 ceremony, when lo! and beholden, four big, awful, rough lookin' men rushed in with big pistols and mighty ter- rible bowtie knives, and big papers and big seals, and said they was a sheriff and possum from Kaintucky. They jist jumped right onto the gal an' her father an' han'cuffed 'em, an' took 'em!" "'Handcuffed them and took them!"I re- peated, suddenly growing intensely interested. This was beating my dime novel, for sensation, all hollow.   &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8053-00000009"/> 16  .A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. Yes, sir, han'cuffed'em an' took 'em, an' away they went, an' they've not been hearn of since to this day. But the mysteriousest thing about the whole business was that when the sheriff grabbed the gal he called her George, and said she wasn't no gal at all, but jist a terrible onery boy 'at had been stealin' an' counterfeitin' an' robbin' all round everywhere. What d'ye think of that?" "A remarkably strange affair, certainly," I replied; " and do you say that the father and the girl have not since been heard from!" "Never a breath. The thing got into all the newspapers and raised a awful rumpus, and it turned out that it wasn't no sheriffi'at come there; but some dark, mysterious kid- nappin' transaction 'at nobody could account for. Detectives was put onf their track an' follered 'em to Injun territory an' therelost 'em. Some big robberies was connected wfi the affair, but folks could never git head nor tail of the partic'lers."    * "-And it wasn't a real sheriff's arrest, then " said I. "No, sir, 'twas jist a mystery. Some kind of a dodge of a band'of desperadoes to avoid the law some way. The papers tried to explain it, but I never could -see any sense to it. 'Twas ']-    gH *g      *WASO SHE A BUY?   17 a clean, dead mystery. But I was goia' on to tell ye 'at Berry Young took it awful hard 'bout the gal, an' he's been sort o' sinkin' away ever sence, an' now he's jist ready to wink out. Yonder's were Berry lives, in that 'ere white cottage hoa with the vines round the winder. He's desp'rit sick-a sort o' consumption. I'm goin' to see 'im now; good mornin' to ye." Thus abruptly ending our interview, the doctor took up his medicine bag and went his way. He left me in a really excited state of mind; the story of itself was so strange, and the narrator had told it so solemnly and graphically. I suppose, too, that I must havea, been in just the proper state of mind for that rough outline, that cartoon of a most startling and mysterious affair, to becomne deeply im- pressed in my mind, perhaps, in the most fascinating and fantastic light possible. A thirst to know more of the story took strong holde on my mnd, as if I hadll been reading a tantalizing romance and had found the leaves torn out just where the mystery was to be ex- plained. I half closed my eyes to better keep in the lines aad shades of the strange picture. Its influence lay upon me like a spell. I en- joyed it. It was a luxury. The wings of the morning wind fanned the 2*    &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8053-00000010"/> 18  A BOOK' OF HOOSERt MOSAICS. heat into broken waves, rising and sinking, and flowing on, with murmur and flash and glim- mer, to the cool green ways of the woods, and, like the wind, my fancy went out among golden fleece clouds and into shady places, following the thread of this new romance. I cannot give a sufiicient reason why the story took so fast a hold ont me. But it did grip my mind and master it. It appeared to me the most in- tensely strange affair I had ever heard of.  While I sat there, lost in reflection, with my eyes bent on a very unpromising pig, that wallowed in the dainp earth by the town pump, the landlord of the hotel came out and took a seat beside me. I gave him a pipe of my tobacco and forthwith began plying him with questions touching the affair of which the doctor had spoken. He confirmed the story, and added to its mystery by going minutely into its details. He gave the names of thpe father and daughter as Charles Afton and Ollie]&amp;Afton.        , Olle Afton! Certainly no name sounds sweeter! How is it that these gifted, mys- teriously beautiful persons always have musical names! "Ah," said the landlord, , you'd ort to have seen that boy!" %   WAS SHE A BOY?      19 4"Boy!"I echoed. "Well, gal or boy, one or tVother, the wonderfulest humnl bein' I ever see in all the days o' nmy life!, Lips as red as ripe cur'n's, and for ever smilin'. Such smiles-oonkoo! they hurt a feller all over, they was so sweet. She was tall an' dark, an' had black hair that curled short all 'round her head. Her-.skin was wonderful clear and so Mwas her eyes. But it was the way she looked at you that got you. Ah, sir, she had a power in them eyes, to be sure!" The pig got up from his muddy place by the pump, grunted, as if satisfied, and slowly. strolled off; a country lad drove past, riding astride the hounds of a wagon; a pigeon lit on the comb of the roof of Sheehan's saloon, which was just across the street, and began plumning itself. Just then the landlord's little sharp-nosed, weasel-eyed boy came out and said, in a very subdued tone of voice: "Pap, mam   says 'at if yon don't kill ler that 'ere chiclen for dinner you kin go widout any fing to eat all she cares." The landlord's spouse was a  red-headed woman, so he got up very suddenly and took himself into the house. But before he got out of hearing the little boy remarked:  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8053-00000011"/> 20  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. "Pap, I speaks for the gizzard of that 'ere chicken, dc'e hear, now l" I sat there till the dinner hour, watching the soft pink and white vapors that rolled rould the verge of the horizon. I was thoroughly saturated with romance. Strange, that here, in this dingy little out of-the-way village, should have transpired one of the most wonderful mysteries history may ever hold! At dinner the landlord talked volubly of the Afton affair, giving it as his opinion that the Aftons were persons tinged with negro blood, and had been kidnapped into slavery. "They was jist as white, an' whiter, too, than I am," he went on, " but them Southern- ers 'd jist as soon sell one personas 'nother, anyhow." I noticed particularly that the little boy got his choice bit of the fowl.. He turned his head one side and ate like a cat. When the meal was over I was again joined by Doctor Hurd on the verandah. He reported Berry Young still alive, but not able to live till midnight. I noticed that the doctor was nervous and kept his eyes fixed on Sheehan's saloon. "Stranger," said he, leaning over close to me, and speaking in a low, guarded way,   WAS SHE A BOY?      21 things is workin' dasted curious 'bout now- sure's gun's iron they jist is!' Where-how-in what way, doctor?"I stammered, taken aback by his behavior. "Sumpum's up, as sure as Ned!" he replied, wagging his head. "4 Doctor," I said, petulantly, " if you)would be a ,trifle more explicit I could probably guess, with some show of certainty, at what you mnean!" "Can't ye hear? Are ye deaf? Did ye ever, in all yer born days, hear a voice like that ere 'un? Listen!" Sure enough, a voice of thrilling power, a rich, heavy, quavering alto, accompanied by some one thrumming on a guitar, trickled and gurgled, and poured through the open window of Sheehan's saloon. The song was a wild, drinking carol, full of rough, reckless wit, but I listened, entranced, till it was done. "There now, say, what d'ye think o' that? Ain't things a workin' round awful curious, as I said?" Delivering himself thus, the-doctor got up and walked off. When I again. had an opportunity to speak to the landlord, I asked binl if Doctor Hurd was not thought to be slightly demnented.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8053-00000012"/> 22  A BOOK OF HOOSIERt MOSAICS. "What! crazy, do you mean t  No, sir; bright as a pill!" "Well," said I, "he's a very queer fellow any how. 3By the way, who {-as that singing just now over in. the saloon there? 4"Don't know, didn't hear 'em. Some of the blioys, I s'pose. They have some lively swells over there sometimes. Awful hole." I resumed my dime novel, and nothing further transpired to aggravate or satisfy my curiosity concerning the strange story I had heard, till night came down and the bats began to wheel through the moonless blackness Labove the dingy town. At the coming on of dusk I flung away the book and took to my pipe. Some one touched ime on the shoulder, rousing me from a deep reverie, if not a doze. "Ha, stranger, this you, eh? Berry Young's a dyin'; go over there wi' me, will ye?" It was the voice of Doctor Hurd. 'What need for me have you'?"I relied, rather stiffly, not inuch relishing this too ob- trusive familiarity. "Well-H jist kinder wanted ye to go over. The poor boy's 'bout passin' away, amn' things is a workin' so tarnation curions! Come 'long wiR me, friend, will ye "' Something in the fellow's voice touched me,   WAS SHE A BO-Y?      23 and without another word I arose and followed him to the cottage. The night was intensely black. I think' it was clear, but a heavy fog from the swamps had settled over everything, and through this dismal veil the voices of owls from far and near struck-with hollow, sepulchral effect. '"A heart is the trump!" sang out that alto voice from within the saloon -as -e passed. Doctor Hurd clutched my arm   and mut- teredl ' "That's that voice ag'in! Strange-strange! Poor Berry Young!" We entered the cottage and found ourselves in a cosy little room, where, on a low bed, a pale, intelligent lookling young man lay, evi- dently dying.  He was very much emaciated, his eyes, wonderfully large and luminous, were sunken, and his breathing quick and difficult. A haggard, watqhing-worn woman sat bv his bed. From her resemblance to him I toolk her to be his sister. She was evidently very un- well herself. We sat in silence by his bedside, watching his life flow into eternity, till the little clock on the mantel struck, sharp and clear, the hour of ten. The sound of the bell startled the sick man, and after some incoherent mumbling he said, quite distinctly:  *  e           %  z ',.  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8053-00000013"/> 24  A BOOK .OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. "Sister, if you ever again see Ollie Afton, tell him-tell her-tell, say I forgive him-- say to her-him-I loved her. all my life-tell him-ah! what was I saying? Don't cry, sis, please. What a sweet, faithful sister! Ah! it's almost over, dear--  Ah, me!" For some minutes the sister's sobbing echoed strangely through the house. The dying man drew h' head far down in the soft pillow. A breat of damp air stole through the room. All at once, right under the window by which the bed sat, arose a touching guitar pre- lude-a tangled mesh of melody-gusty, throb- bing, wandering through the room and stray- ing off into the night, tossing back its trembling echoes fainter and fainter, till, as it began to die, that same splendid alto voice caught the key and flooded the darkness with song. The sick man raised himself on his elbow, and his face flashed out the terrible smile of death. He listened eagerly. It was the song "Come Where my Love lies Dreaming," but who has heard it rendered as it was that night? Every chord of the voice was as sweet and witching as'a wind harp's, and the low, humming under- tone of the accompaniment was perfection. Tenderly but awfully sweet, the music at length faded into utter silence, and Berry Young sank limp and pallid upon his pillows.   WAS SHE A BOY?    . 25 'j  .; Itis Ollie hbe hoarsely-whispered. "Tell her-tell him-O say to her for me--ah! water.   sis, it's all over!" The woman hastened, but before she could get the water to his lips he was dead. His last word was Ollie. The sister cast herself upon the dead man's bosom  and sobbed wildly, piteously. Soon after this some neighbors came in, which gave -me an opportunity to quietly take my leave. The night was so foggy and dark that, but for a bright stream of light from a window of Sheehan's saloon, it would have been hard for- me to find my way back to the hofel. I did find it, however, and sat down upon the ve- randah.  I had nearly fallen asleep, thinking over the strange occurrences of the past few hours, when the rumble of an approaching train of cars on the I. C. &amp; L. from the east aroused me; and, at the same moment, a great noise began oiver in the saloon. High words, a  few bitter oatlis, a struggle as of persons fighting, a loud, sonorous crash like the crush- ing of a musical instrument' and then I saw the burly bar tender hurl some one out through the doorway just as the express train stopped close byi.  s All aboard!" cried the conductor, wav ing 3  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8053-00000014"/> 26  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. his lantern. At the same time, as the bar. tender stood in the light of his doorway, a brickbat, whizzing from the darkness, struck him full in the face, knocking him precipitately back at full length on to the floor of the saloon. "All aboard!" repeated the conductor. "All aboard!" jeeringly echoed a delicious alto voice; and I saw a slender man step up on the rear platform of the smoking car. A flash from the conductor's lantern lit up for a moment this fellow's face, and it was the most beautiful visage I have ever seen. Extremely youthful, darkresplendent, glorious, set round with waves and ringlets of black hair-it was such. a countenance as I have imagined a young Chaldean might have, had who was destined to the high calling of astrology. It was a face to charm, to electrify the beholder with its indescribable, almost unearthly loveli- ness of features and expression. The engine whistled, the bell rang, and as the- train moved on, that slender, almost fragile form and wonderful face 'disappeared in the darkness. As the roar and clash of the receding cars began to grow faint in the distance, a gurgling, grunting sound over in the saloon reminded me that the bar-tender might need some atten-   WAS SHE A BOY?      27 tion, so I stepped across the street and went in. He was just taking himself up from the floor, with his nose badly smashed, spurting blood over him pretty freely. He was in an ecstasy of fury and swore fearfully. I rendered him all the aid I could, getting the blood stopped, at length, and a plaster over the wound. "Who struck you?" I asked. "Who struck me?

The shattered wreck of a magnificent guitar lay in the middle of the floor. I picked it up, and, engraved on a heavy silver plate set in the ebony neck, I read the name, Georgina Olive Afton. v .    -^   tTROUT'S iUGK. As early as eight o'clock the grand entrance gateway to the Kokomo fair ground was thronged with vehicles of almost every kind; horsemen, pedestrians, dogs and dust were borne forward together in clouds that boiled and swayed and tumbled. Noise seemed to be the chief purpose of every one and the one certain result of every thing in the crowd. This had been advertised as the merriest day that might ever befall the quiet, honest folk of the rural regions circumjacent to Kokomo, and it is even hinted that aristocratic dames and business plethoricmen of the town itself had caught somewhat of the excitement spread abroad by the announcement in the county papers, and by huge bills posted in conspicuous places, touching Le Papillon and his monster balloon, which balloon and which Le Papillon were pictured to the life, on the said posters, in the act of sailing over the sun, and under the picture, in remarkably distinct letters, "No humbug! go to the fair!"  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8053-00000016"/> 30  A BOOK OF HOOSIEFR MOSAICS. Dozier's minstrel troupe was dlancing and singing attendance on this agricultural, ex- hibition, too, and somebody's whirling pavilion, a shooting gallery, a monkey show, the glass works, and what not of tempting promises of entertainments, amusing and instructive." Until eleven o'clock the entrance gateway to the fair ground was crowded. Farm wagons truudled in, drawn by sleek, well fed plough nags, and stowed full of smiling folk, old and young, male and female, from the out .town- ships; buggies with youths and maidens, the sparkle of breastpins and flutter of ribbons; spring wagons full of students and hard bats from town; carriages brimming with laces, flounces, over skirts, fancy kid gloves, funny little hats and less bonnets, all fermented into languid ebullition by imill-eyed ladies; omni- buses that bore fleshy gentlemen, who wore linen dusters and silk hats and smoked fine cigars; and jammed in among all these were boys on skittish colts, old fellows on flea-bit gray mares, withl noow and then a reckless stripling on a mule. Occasionally a dog got kicked or run over, giving the assistance of his howls and yelps to the general din, and over all the dust hung heavily in a yellow cloud, shot through with the lightnin'g of hur-   TBOUT'S LUCK.      31 nished trappings and echoing with the hoarse thunder of the trampling, shouting rumbling multitude. Indeed, that hot aguish autumn day let fall its sunshine on the heads and blew its feverish breath through the rifts of the greatest and liveliest mass of people ever assembled in fioward county. Inside the extensive enclosure the 'multitude divided itself into streams, ponds, eddies, re- fluent .currents and noisy whirlpools of people. Some rare attraction was everywhere. Early in the day the eyes of certain of the rustic misses followed admiringly the forms of Jack Trout and Bill Powell, handsome young fellows dressed in homespun clothes, who, arm in arm, strolled leisurely across the grounds, looking sharply about for some proper place to begin the expNediture of what few dimes they had each been able to hoard up against this gala day. They had not long to hulnt. On every hand the "hawkers hawked their wares." Rising and falling, tender-toned, deftly man- aged, a voice rang out Iacross the crowd plead- ing with those who had long desired a good investment for their money, and begging them to be sure and not let slip this last golden opportunity.,  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8053-00000017"/> 32  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. ,4 Only a half a dollah! Come right along this way now! Here's the great golden scheme by which thousands have amassed untold for- tunes! Here's your only and last chance to get two ounces of first class candy, with the probability of five dollars in gold coin, all for the small sum of half a dollah! And the cry is--still they come!" The speaker was such a mnan as one often observes in a first class railway car, with a stout valise beside him containing samples, dressed with remarkable care, and ever on the alert to make one's acquaintance. He stood on top of a small table or tripod, holding in his hand a green pasteboard package just taken from a box at his feet. Only a half a dollah and a fortune in your grasp! Here's the gold! Roll right this way and run your pockets over!" Drifting round with the tide of impulsive pleasure seekers into which they happened to fall, Jack Trout and Bill Powell floated past a bevy of lasses, the prettiest of whom was, NMinny Hart, a girl whose healthy, vivid beauty was fast: luring Jack on to the rock of matri- monial proposals. "Jimminy, but ain't she a little sweety!" exclaimed the latter, pinching Bill's arm as they passed, and glancing lovingly at DMinny.   TROUT'S LUCK.      33 9' You're tellin' the truth and talkin' it smooth," replied'Bill, bowing to the girls with the swagger peculiar to a rustic who i'macgines he has turned a fine period. And with flatter- ing hearts the boys passed on. "Roll on ye torrents! Only a half a dollah! Right this way if you want to become a bloated aristocrat in less than no time! Five dollahs in gold for only a half a dollah! And whose the next lucky man?" Blown by the fickle, gusty breath of luck, our two young friends were finally wafted to the feet of this oily vendor of prize packages, and they there lodged, becalmed in breathless interest, to await their turn, each full of faith in the yellow star of his fortune-a gold coin of the value of five dollars. They stood atten- tively watching the results of other men's in- vestments, feeling their fingers tingle when now and then some lucky fellow drew the cov- eted prize. Five dollars is a mighty tempta- tion to a poor country boy in Indiana. That sum will buy oceans of fun at a fair where almost any "sight" is to be seen for the-.  small saim of twenty-five cents!" Without stopping to take into considerationi the possible, or rather, the probable result of such a venture, Bill Powell handed up his.

Was it sig- nificant of anything that a blue jaty fluttered for a momnent right over the crier's head just at the point of his detaching some glittering object from the contents of the box? 4 Here you are, my frienll; luck's a fortune!" yelled the man, as he held the gold coin high above his head, shaking it in fill view of all eyes in the multitude. "Here you are! whichh 'd you rather have, the gold or five and a half in greenbacks?" u Hand me in the rag chips-goll dlo't feel good to my fingers," answered Bill Powell, swaggering again and grasping the currency with a hand that shook with eagerness. Jack Trout stood by, clutcling in his fever- ish palm a tWo-dollar bill. His face was pale, his lips set, his muscles rigid. He hesitfated to trust in the star of his destiny. Het stood eyeing the bridge of Lodii the dykes of Arcole. Would he risk all on a bold venture? His right shoulder began to twitch convulsively.

Only a i  1half a dollah! And who's the next lucky man?"a A yell of laughter from the crowd greeted this occurrence, and Jack floated back on the recoiling waves of his chagrin till he, was hid- den in the dense concourse, and the upper- most thought in his mind found forcible ex- i , pression in the three monosyllables: , Hang the luck!"        ' It is quite probable that of all the unfortu- nate adventurers that day singed in the yel- low fire of that expert gambler's gold, Jack recognized himself as the most terribly burned. Putting his hands into his empty pockets he sauntered dolefully about, scarcely able to look straight into the face of such friends as he chanced to meet. He  acted as if hunting for something lost on the ground.

For a single moment he was blessed, but on feeling for his money and recalling the luckless result of his late venture, he felt a chill creep up his back, and a lump of the size of his fist jump up into his throat. Here was a bad affair for him I He stood for a single point of time staring into the face of his despair, then, acting on the only plan he could think of to escape from the predicament, lie said : "Wait a bit, Minny, I've got to go jist down here a piece to see a feller. I'll be back d'rectly. You stay right here and when I come back I'll trot you in." So speaking, asi if in a great hurry, and sweating cold drops, with a ghastly smile flickering on his face, the young man slipped away into the crowd. Minny failed to notice his confusion, and so   TROUT^S LUCK.     37 called after him cheerily: , Well, hurry, Jack, for I!m most dead to see the show!" What could Trout do? He spun round and roundin that vast flood of people like a fish with but one eye. ;Ie rushed here, he darted there, and ever and anon, as a lost man returns upon his starting point, he came in sight of sweet Minny Hart patiently waiting, for his return. Then he would spring back into the crowd like a deer leaping -back into a thicket at sight of a hunter. Penniless at the fair with lIinny Hart waiting for him to take her into the show! Few persons can realize how keenly he now felt the loss of his money. He ought, no doubt, to have told the lass at once just how financial matters stood; but nothing was more remote from his mind than doing anything of the kind. He was too vain. "Tell 'er I au't got no money! No, sir-ee!" he muttered. "But what am I to do? Bust the luck! Hang the luck! - ot the luck!" lHe hurried hither and thither, intent on nothing andi taking no heed of the course he pursued. His cheeks were livid and his eyes had in themi that painful, worried, wistful look so often seen in the eyes of men going home from ruin on Wall street. Meantime that sea of persons surged this 4'  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8053-00000020"/> 38   A BOOKr OF HOOSIER MOS ICS. way and that, flecked with a foam of ribbons and dancing bubbles of hats, now flowing slowly through the exhibition rooims a tide of critics, now breaking into groups and scattered throngs of babblers, anon uniting to roar round some novel engine suddenly set to work, or to break on the barrier of the trolling ring into a spray of cravats and a mist of flounces. Swimming round in this turbulent tide like a crazy flounder with but one fin, Jack finally found himself hard by the p)avilion of the minstrels. He could hear somewhat of the side-splitting jokes, with the laughs that followed, the tinkle of banjo accompaniments and the mellow cadences of plantation songs, the rattle of castanets and the tattoo of the jig dancers' feet. A thirst like the thirst of fever took hold of him. "Come straight along gentlemen and ladies! This celebrated troupe is now performing dcl twenty-five cents pays the bill! Only a quawtah of a dollah!" bawled the fat crier from his lofty perch. ' That's right, my young man, take the young lady in! She's sure to love you better; walk right along!" "Her lip am sweet as sugah, Her eye am bright as wine, Dat yaller little boogali Her name am Emiline 1"   TROUT S LUCK.       39 suul by four fine voices, came bubbling from within. The music thrilled Jack to the bone, X  .lMand he felt once more for his money. Not a cent. This was bad. "You're the lad for me," continued the fat a  man on the high seat; "take your nice little /  sweetheart right in and let her see the fun.' W- Walk right in!" Jack looked to see who it was, and a pang shot through his heart and settled in the very mInarrow of his bones; forlo! arm in arm, Bill Powell and Minny Hart passed under the pavilion into the full glory of the show! "O cut me up for fish bait An' feed me to de swine, Don't care where I goes to SoI has Emiline!" sang the minstrel-chorus. "Dast him, he's got me!" muttered Jack as Bill and Minny disappeared within. He turned away, sick at heart, and this was far from the first throe of jealousy he had suffered on Bill's account. Indeed it had given him no little uneasiness lately to see how sweetly Minny sometimes smiled on young Powell. "Yes, sir," Jack continued to mutter to himself, "yes, sir, he's got me! He's about  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8053-00000021"/> 40  'A. BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. three lengths ahead o' me, as these boss fellers says, an' I don't know but what PI'n distanced. Blow the blasted luck!" Heartily tired of the fair, burning with racge, and jealousy, and despair, but still vaguely hoping against hope for some better luck from some visionary source Jack strolled about, chewing the bitter cud of his feelings, his hands up to his elbows in his trowser pockets and- his soul up to its ears in the flood of dis- content. He puckered his mouth into whistling position, but it refused to whistle. He felt as if he had a corn cob crossways in his throat. The wind blew his new hat off and a mule kicked the top out of the crown. "Only a half a dollah! Who's the next lucky man " cried the prize package fellow. I'm now going to sell a new sort of packages, each of which, beside the usual amIount of choice candy, contains a piece of jewelry of pure gold! Who takes the first chance for only a half a dollah 7" '"Ere's your mule!" answered Bill Powell, as with Minny still clinging to his arn, he pushed through the crowd and handed up the money. - Bravely dol!e!" shouted the crier; "see what a beautiful locket and chain! Luck's a   TnOUT'S LUCK.      41 fortune! And who's the next to invest'? Come right along and don't be afiraid of a little risk! Only a half a dollah !?P Jack saw Bill put the glittering chain round Minny's neck and fasten the locket in her belt; saw the eyes of the sweet girl gleam proudly, gratefully i saw black spots dancing before his own eyes; saw Bill swagger and toss his head. He turned dizzily away, whispering savagely, " Dern im !" Just here let Ine say that such an expression is not a profane one. I once saw a preacher kick at a little dog that got in his way on the sidewalk.  The minister's foot missed -the little dog and hit an iron fence, and the little dog bit the minister's other leg and jumped through the fence. The minister performed a pas de zephyr and very distinctly said "Dern him !I Wherefore I don't think it can be any- thing more than a mere puff of fretfulness. After this Jack was for some time standing near the entrance to the 1' glass-works," a place where transparent steam engines and wonderful fountains were on exhibition.

"Onery nor a dog!" hissed Jack, shambling off; and once more taking a long deep dive under the surface of the crowd. A ground swell cast him again near the vender of prize packages. "Only a half a dollah!" he yelled; " come where fortune smiles, and cares and poverty take flight, for only a half a dollah!" "Jist fifty cents more'n I've got about my clothes-!" replied Jack, and the bystanders, taking this for great wit, joined in a roar of laughter, while with a grim smile the des- perate youth passed on till he found himself near the toe mark of a shooting gallery, where for five cents one might have, two shots with an air gun. He stood there for a time watch- ing a number of persons try their marksman- ship. It was small joy to know that he was a fine off-hand shot, so long as he had not a nickel in his pocket, but still he stood there wishing he might try his hand. "Cl'ar the track here! Let this 'ere lady   TROUT'S LUCK.      43 take a shoot!" cried a familiar voice; and a w'y was opened for Bill Powell and Minny Hart. The little maiden was placed at the toe mark and a gun given to her. She handled the weapon like one used to it. She raised it, : sshut one eye, took deliberate aim and fired. ;   "' Centre!" roared the marker, as to the sound ?  of a bell the funny little puppet leaped up and j . grinned above the target. Every body stand-   ing near laughed and some of the boys cheered vociferously. Minny looked sweeter than ever. '  Jack Trout felt famished. He begged a chew of tobacco of a stranger, and, grinding the weed furiously, walked off to where the yellow i : pavilion with its painted air-boats was whirl- ing its cargoes of happy boys and girls round  : and round for the "Small sum of ten cents."   A long, lean, red-headed fellow in one of the boats was paying for a ride of limitless length by scraping on a miserable fiddle. To Jack this seemed small labor for so much fun. How he envied the fiddler as he flew round, trailing his tunes behind him! "Wo'erp there! Stop yer old merchine! We'll take a ride ef ye don't keer!" The pavilion was stopped, a boat lowered for Bill Powell and Minny Hart, who got in side by side, and the fiddler struck up the  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8053-00000023"/> "  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. tune of 4 Black-eyed Susie." Jack watched that happy couple go round and round, till, by the increased velocity, their two faces i melted into one, which was neither Bill's nor Minny's-it was Luck's! "He's got one onto me," muttered Jack.; ' I've got no money, can't fiddle for a ride, nor nothin', and I don't keer a ding whllat becomes o' me, nohow!" With these words Jack wended his way to a remote part of the fair grounlld, where, under gay awniugs, the sutlers had spread their tempting variety of cakes, pies, fruits, nuts and loaves. Here were persons of all ages and sizes-men, women and children-eatting at well supplied tables. The sight was a fascinat- ing one, and, though seeing others eat didll not in the least appease his own hunger, Jack stood for a long time watching the departure of pies and the steady lessening of huge pyra- mids of sweet cakes. He particularly noticed one little table that had on its centre a huge peach pie, which table was yet unoccupied. While he was actually thinking over the plan of eating the pie and trusting to his legs to bear him beyond the reach of a dun, Bill anll Minny sat down by the table and p)roceededl to discuss the delicious, red-llearted heaD of' as- try. At this point Bill caught Jack's eye:   , H        TROUT'S LUCK.      45 Come here, Jack," said he; this pie's more'n we can eat, come and help us."7 "Yes, come along, Jack," put in Minny in her sweetest way; '"I want to tell you what Ai lot of fun we've had, and more than that, I want to know why you didn't come back and take me into the show!" - I ain't hungry," muttered Jack, ' and be- sides I've got to go. see a feller." He turned away almost choking. ' "Bill's got me. 'Tainlt no use talkin', Im played out for good. I'm a trumped Jack!" He smiled a sort of flinty smile at his poor wit, and, shuffled aimlessly along through the densest clots of the crowd. And it so continued to happen, that wher- ever Jack happened to stop for any consider- able length of time he was sure to see Bill and , Minny enjoying samof  rare treat, or disappear- ing in or emerging from some place of amuse- m ent. At last, driven to desperation, he determined on trying to borrow a dollar from his father. He immediately set about to find the old gen- tleman ; a task of no little difficulty in such a crowd. It was Jack's forlorn hope, and it had a gloomy outlook; for old 'Squire Trout was thought by competent judges to be the stin-  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8053-00000024"/> "(- A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. giest man in the county. But hoping for the best, Jack hunted him here, there and every- where, till at length he met a friend who said he had seen the 'Squire in the act of leaving the fair ground for home just a few minutes before. Taking no heed of what folks might say, Jack, on receiving this intelligence, darted across the ground, out at the gate and down the roadl at a speed worthy of success; but alas! his hopes were doomed to wilt. At the first turn of the, road he met a man who inl formed him that he had passed 'Squire Trout some three miles out on his way home, which home was full nine miles distant! Panting, crestfallen, defeated, done for, poor Jack slowly plodded back to the fairl ground gate, little dreaming of the new trouble, that awaited him there.

He tried to explain, but it was no go.  You needn't try that game on me," said the gatekeeper. "So just plank down your money or stay outside." Then Jack got furious, but the gatekeeper ,     {   TROUT'S LUCK.      47 remarked that he had frequently 11hearn it thunder afore this!" Jack smiled like a corpse and turned away. Going a short distance down the road he climbed i k  up and sat down on top of the fence of a late !J W; lmown clover field. Then he took out his jack- lknife and begalrto whittle a splinter plucked d g  from a rail. His face was gloomy, his eyes e! i: lustreless. Finally he stretched himself, hun- ?  ^gNry jealous, envious, hateful, on top of the :. fence with his lbead between the crossed stakes.  His face thus upturned to heaven, he watched l?  two crows drift 'over, high up in the torrid reaches of autumn air, hot as summer, even hotter, and allowed his lips free privilege to, anathematize his luck. For a long time he lay thus, dimly conscious of the blue bird's song  auld the water-like ripple of the grass in the fence corners. t Minny, Minny Hart, Minny!" sang the meadow larks, and the burden of the grasshopper's ditty was  "Only a half a dollah!" All at once there arose from the fair ground a mighty chorus of yells, that went echoing off across the country to the bluffs of Wild-cat Creek and died far off in the,)woods toward Greentown. Jack did not raise his head, but l lay there in a sort of morose stupor, knowing  [  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8053-00000025"/> 48  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. well that whatever the sport might be, he had no hand in it. "Let 'em rip!" he muttered, "Bill's got me!" Presently the wagons and other vehicles be- gan to leave the ground, from one of which he caught the sound of a sweet, familiar voice. He looked just in time to get a glimpse of Mr. H/art's wagon, and in it, side by side, Bill Powell and Minny! A cloud of yellow dust soon hid them, and turning away his head, happening to glance upward, Jack saw, just disappearing in a thin white cloud, the golden disc of Le Papillon's balloon! He immediately descended from his perch and began plodding his way home, muttering as he did so "Dast the luck! Ding the prize package feller! Doggone Bill Powell! Blame the old b'loon! Dern everybody!" It was long after nightfall when he reached his father's gate. Hungry, weak, foot-sore, collapsed, he leaned his chin on the top rail of the gate and stood there for a nomenlt while the starlight fell around him, sifted through the dusky foliage of the old beeclh trees, and from the- far dim caverns of the night a voice smote on his ear, crying out tenderly, mock- ingly, persuasively- EP,    TROUT'S LUCK.       49 i   a Only a half a dollah!"

THE corner brick storehouse-in fact the only brick building in Jimtown-was to be sold at auction; anld, consequently, by ten o'clock in the morning, a considerable body of men had collected near the somewhat dilapi- dated house, directly in front of which the auctioneer, a fat man from Indianapolis, mounted on an old goods box, began crying, partly through his tobacco-filled mouth and partly through his very unmusical nose, as follows:- "Come up, gentlemen, and examine the new, beautiful and commodious property I now offer for sale! Walk round the house, men, and view it from every side. Go into it, if you like, up stairs and down, and then give me a bid, somebody, to start with. It is a very desirable house, indeed, gentlemen." With this preliminary puff, the speaker paused and glanced slowly over his audience with the air of a practiced physiognomist.   BIG MEDICINE.      51 The crowd before him was, in many respects, an interesting one. Its most prominent indi- vidual, and the hero of this sketch, was Dave Cook, sometimes called Dr. Cook, but more commonly answering to the somewhat savage sounding sobriquet of Big Medicine-a man some thirty-five years of age, standing six feet six in his ponderous boots; broad, bony, mus- cular, a real giant, with a strongly marked Roman face, and brown, shaggy hair. He was dressed in a soiled and somewhat patched suit of butternut jeans, topped off with a wide rimmed wool hat, wonderfully battered, and lopped in every conceivable way. He wore a watch, the chain of which, depending from the waisthand of his pants, was of iron, and would have weiglled fully a pound avoirdupois. He stood quite still, near the auctioneer, smoking a clay pipe, his herculean arms folded on his breast, his feet far apart. As for the others of the crowd, they were, taken collectively, about such as one used always to see in the "dark corners" of Indiana, such as Boone county used to be before the building of any railroads through it, such as the particular locality of Jimtown was before the ditching law and the I.

Big Medicine seemed to be the only utterly com- placent man in the assembly. All the others discovered evidences of much inward disturb- ance, muttering mysteriously to each other, and casting curious, inquiring glances at an individual, a stranger in the place, who, with a pair of queer green spectacles astride his nose, and his arms crossed behind him, was slowly sauntering about the building offered for sale, apparently examining it with some care. His general appearance was that of a well dressed gentlkman, which of itself was enough to excite remark in Jimtown, espe- "ially--when an auction was on hand, and everybody felt jolly. * Them specs sticks to that nose o' his'n like a squir' to a knot!" said one. "His pantaloons is rather inclined to be knock-kneed," put in an old, grimy sinner leaning on a single barrelled shot gun. "Got lard enough onto his hair to shorten a mess o' pie crust," added a liver colored boy. 4 Walks like he'd swallered a fence rail, too," chimed in a humpbacked fellow split almost to his chin. Chaws mighty fine terbacker, you bet."   BIG MEDICINE.      53 "Them there boots o' his'n set goin' an' comin' like a grubbin' hoe onto a crooked baln'le." "Well, take 'm up one side and down t'other, he's a mod'rately onery lookin' feller." These remarks were reckoned smart by those who perpetrated them, and were by no means meant for real slurs on the individual at whom they were pointed. Indeed they Were deliv- ered in guarded undertones, so that he might not hear them; and he, meanwhile, utterly ignorant of affording any sport, continued his examination of the house, the while some happy 'frogs in a neighboring pond rolled out a rat- tling, jubilant chorus, and the summer wind poured through the leafy tops of the tall elms and athletic burr oaks with a swash and roar like a turbulent river. "What am I now offered for this magnifi- cent property? Come, give me a bid! Speak up lively! What do I hear for the house?" The auctioneer, as he spoke, let his eyes wander up the walls of the old, dingy building, to where the blue birds and the peewees had built in thecracks and along the warped cor- nice and troken window frames, and just then it chancedcthat a woman's face appeared at one of those staring holes, which, with broken I .   q *'  5*   &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8053-00000028"/> 54  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. lattice and shattered glass, still might be called a window. The face was a plump, cheerful one, the more radiant from contrast with the dull wall around it--a face one could -never forget, however, and would recall often, if for nothing but the fine fall of yellow hair that framed it in. It was a sweet, winning, intellectual face, full of the gentlest womanly charms. "Forty dollars for the house, 'oman and all!" cried Big Medicine, gazing up at the ,window in which, for the merest moment, the face appeared. The man with the green spectacles darted a quick glance at the speaker. -"I am bid forty dollars, gentlemen, forty dollars, do all hear.  Agoing for forty dol- lars!

Many whiskered, uncouth, but not unkindly faces were upturned to the window only in time to see the beautiful woman disappear quite hastily.

This made the crowd lively. Every man nudged his neighbor, and the aguish, blue- eyed boy grinned in a ghastly, self-satisfied way. "Agoing at fifty dollars! Fiddlesticks! The house is worth four thousand. No fooling here now! Agoing at only fifty dollars-going--" "' Six hundred dollars," said he of the green glasses in a clear, pleasant voice. "Six hundred dollars!" echoed the auc- tioneer in a triumphant thunderous tone. '"That sounds like business.

It was expressive of more than words could rightly convey. Six hundred dollars, cash down, was a big sumn for the crazy old house, but he had made up  his mind to buy it, and now he seemed likely to have to let it go or pay more than it was worth. The stem of his clay pipe settled back full three inches into his firmly-set mouth, so that there seemed imminent danger to the huge brown moustache that overhung the fiery bowl. He returned the stare of the stranger with interest, and said "Six hundred an' ten-dollars." ' Agoing, a -, began the auctioneer. "Six twenty," said the stranger. "Ago-- ." "Six twenty-one!" growled Big Medicine. "Six twenty-five!" quickly added his an- tagonist. Big Medicine glanced heavenward, and for a moment allowed his eyes to follow the flight of a great blue heron that slowly winged its way, high up in the yellow summer reaches of splendor, toward the distant swamps where the white sycamores spread their fanciful arms above the dark green maples and dusky witch- hazel thickets. The auctioneer, a close ob- server, saw an ashy hue, a barely discernible   BIG I3EDICINE.      57 shade, ripple across the great Roman face as Big Medicine said, in a jerking tone: "Six twenty-five and a half!" The stranger took his cigar from his mouth and smiled placidly. No more imperturbable countenance could be imagined. "Six twenty-six!" he said gently. "Take the ole house an' be derned to you!" cried Big Medicine, looking furiously at his antagonist. Talke the blamed ole shacke- merack an' all the cussed blue-birds an' peer- weers to boot, for all I keer!" Everybody laughed, and the auctioneer con- tinued: "Agoing for six twenty-six!

"Hooray for the man who hed the most money!" shouted the tallow-faced boy. The sale was at an end. The auctioneer came down from his box- and wiped his face with a red handkerchief. The crowd, as if blown apart by a puff of wind, scattered this way and that, drifting into small, grotesque groups to converse together on whatever topic  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8053-00000030"/> 58   A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. might- happen to suggest itself. Big Medicine see-med inclined to be alone, but the irre- pressible youth of the saffron skin ambled up to him and said, in a tone intended for colmic: "Golly, doctor, but didcl't that 'ere gal prrojuce a orful demand for the ole house! Didn't she set the ole trap off when she peeked out'n the winder!" Big Medicine looked down at the strapping boy, much as a lion might look at a field rat or a weasel, then he doubled his hand into an enormous fist and held it tunder the youth's nose, saying in a sort of growl as he did so: "You see this 'ere bundle o' -bones, don't ye?"   ' Guess so," replied the youth. "Well, would you like a small mess of it?" "Not as anybody knows ofl." '4 Well, then, keep yer derned mouth shot!" Which, accorcdingly, the boy proceeded to do, ambling off as quickly as possible./ About this time, the stranger, having put the green spectacles back upon his nose, walked in the direction of 'Squire Tadmore's office, accompanied by the young woman who had looked from the -window. When Big Medicine saw them lie picked upl a stick aundi began furiously to whittle it with his jackl;    BIG 5MEDICINE.      59 knife. His face wore a comically mingled look of chagrin, wonder, and something like a new and thrilling delight. He puffed out great volumes of smoke, making his pipe wheeze audibly under the vigor of his draughts. He was certainly excited. "Orful joke the boys 'il have on me arter this," he mutteired to himself. "Wonder if the 'oman's the feller's wife?  Monstrous poorty, shore's yer born!" He soon whittled up one stick. He immle- diately dived for another, this time getting hold of a walnut klnot. A   tough thing to whittle, but he attacked it as if it had been a bit of white pine. Soon, after this 'Squire Tad- more's little boy came running down from his father's office to where Big Medicine stood. ;M;r.

Guess I'll go tell 'im myself." And, so sayingi, he moved at a  slashing pace down to the door of the 'Squire's office. He thrust his great hirsute head inside the room, and  glaring at the mild mannered stranger, said: ;"D'ye want to see me?"  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8053-00000031"/> 60  A BOOK OF HOOSIER 3IOSAICS. Mr. Golding got up from his seat and coming out took Big Medicine familiarly by the arm, meanwhile smiling in the most friendly way. "Come one side a little, I wish to speak with you privately, confidentially." Big Medicine went rather sulkily along. When they had gone some distance from the house Mr. Golding lifted his spectacles from his nose, and turning his calm, smiling eyes full upon those of Big Medicine, said, with a shrug of his finely cut shoulders: "I outhid you a little, my friend, but I'm blessed if I haven't got myself into a ridiculous scrape on account of it." (  How so t" growled Big Medicine. "Why, when I come to count my funds In , short a half dollar." You're what V" I lack just a half dollar of having enough money to pay for the house, and I thought I'd rather ask you to loan me the money than any- body else here." BigMedicine stood for a time in silence,whit- tling away, as if for dear life, on the curly knot. Dreamy gusts of perfumed heat swept by from adjacent clover and wheat fields, where the blooms hung thick; little whirlwinds played in the dust at their feet as little whirlwinds al-   BIG MEDICINE.      61 ways do in summer; and far away, faint, and made tenderly musical by dlistance, were heard the notes of a country dinner-horn. Big Medi- cine's ample chest swelled, and swelled, and then he burst at the mouth with a mighty bass laugh, that went battling and echoing round the place. Mr. Golding laughed too, in his own quiet, gentlemanly way. They looked at each other and laughed, then looked off toward the swamps and laughed. Big Medicine put his hands in his pockets almost up to the elbows, and leaned back and laughed out of one corner of his mouth while holding his pipe in the other. "I say, mister," said he at length, "a'n't you railly got but six hundred and twenty-five an' a half?" "Just that much to a cent, and no more," replied Mr. Golding, with a comical smile and bow. Big Medicine took his pipe from his mouth, gave the walnut knot he had dropped a little kick and guffawed louder and longer than be- fore. To have been off at a little distance watching them would have convinced any one that Mr. Golding was telling some rare anec- dote, and that Big Medicine was convulsed with mirth, listeninl. "Well I'm derned if 'taint quare," cried the 6 ]  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8053-00000032"/> 62  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. latter, wringing himself into all sorts of gro- tesque attitudes in the ecstasy of his amuse- nent. "You outhid me half a dollar and then didn't have the half a dollar neither! Wha, wha, wha-ee!" and his cachinnations sounded like rolling of moderate thunder. At the end of this he took out a greasy wal-  let and paid Mr. Golding the required amoumit in silver coin. His chagrin had vanished be- fore the stranger's quiet way of making friends. A week passed over Jimtown. A week of as rare June weather as ever lingered about the cool places of the woods, or glimmered over the sweet clover fields all red with a blush of bloom, where the field larks twittered and the buntings chirped, and where the ladenl bees rose heavily to seek their wild homes in the hollows of the forests. By this time it was generally known in Jimtown that Mr. Golding would soon receive a stock of goods with which to open a " store" in the old corner brick; but Big Medicine knew more than any of his neigh- bors, for he and Golding had formed a part- nership to do business under the ;" name and style" of Cook &amp; Golding. This Abner Golding had lately beenl a wealthy retail man in Cincinnati, and had lost everything by the sudden suspension of a bank   BIG MEDICINE.      63 wherein the bulk of his fortune was on deposit. His creditors had made a run on him and he had been able to save just the merest remnant oflhis goods, and a few hundred dollars in monely. Thus he came to Jimtown to begin life and business anew. To Big Medicine the week had been a long one; why, it would not be easy to tell. No? doubt there had come a turning' point in his life. In those days, and in that particular region, to be a 'store keeper was no small honor. But Big Medicine acted strangely. He wandered about, with his hands in his pockets, whistling plaintive tunes, and often he was seen standing out before the old corner brick, gazing up at one of the vacant windows where pieces of broken lattice were swaying in the wind. At such times he muttered softly to himself: "Ther's wher I fast seed the gal." Four big road wagons doaded with boxes), three of them containing the merchandise and one the scanty household furniture of Mr. Golding and his daughter Carrie, came rum- bling into Jimntowi. Big Medicine was oin hand, a perfect Hercules at unloading and unu- packing. Mr. Golding was sadly pleasant; Carrie was roguishy observant, but womanly and quiet. 1i  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC8053-00000033"/> "  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. The tallow-faced youth and two or three others-stood by watching the proceedings. The former occasionally made a remark at which the others nlever fiailed to laugh. ' Ef ye'll notice, now," said he, " it's a fac 'at whenever Big Medicine does to malke a big surge to lift a box, he fust takes a peep at the gal, an' that 'ere seems to kinder make 'im 'wax strong an' multiply,' as the preacher says, an' then over goes the box!"

"I'm kinder weakly," resumed tallow-face with a comical leer at Big Medicine; " wonder if 't wouldn't be kinder strengthnin' on me ef I'd kinder sidle up towards the gal myself!" 'I'll sidle up to you!" growled Big Medi- cine; and making two strides of near ten feet each, he took the youth by his faded flaxen hair, and holding hin clear of the ground, ad- ministered a half dozen or so of resounding   / BIG MEDICINE,      65 kicks, then tossed him to one side, where he fell in a heap on the ground. When he got on his feet again he began to bristle up and show fight, but when Big Medicine reached for him he ambled off. In due time the goods were all placed on the shelves and Mr. Golding's household furniture arranged in the upper rooms where he par- posed living, Carrie acting as housekeeper. On the first evening after all things had been put to rights, Mr. Golding said to Big Medi- cine: "I suppose we ought to advertise." "Do how ." ' Advertise." "Sartinly," said Big Medicine, having not the faintest idea of what his partner meant. "Who can we get to paint our fence adver- tisements?" A gleam of intelligence shot from BiRMcdi- cine's eyes. He knew now what was wanted. He remembered once, on a visit to Crawfords- ville, seeing these fence advertisements. He comprehended in a moment. ", I know what ye mean, now," he said, with a grin, as if communing with himself on some novel suggestion. "I guess I kin 'tend to that my own self.

A good ijee has jist struck me. You jist leave it all to me." So the thing was settled, and Big Medicine was gone all night. The next day was a sluice of rain. It poured  incessantly from daylight till dark. Big Med- icine sat on the counter in the corner brick and chuckled. His thoughts were evidently  very pleasant ones. Mr. Golding was busy marking goods and Carrie was helping hinm. The great grey eyes of Big Medicine followed the winsome girl all the time. When night came, and she "went up stairs, he said to  Golding:  "That gal o' yoLurn is a mighty smart little  'oman." "Yes, artd she's all I have left," replied Mr,; Golding in a sad tone. ;Big Medicine stroked his brown beard, whist- led a few turns of a jig tune, and, jumping down from the counter, went out into the driz- zly night. A few rods from the house he turned and looked up at the window. A little form was just vanishing from it. ' Ther's wher I fust seed 'the gal, he mur- mured, then turned and went his way, occupied with strange sweet imaginings. As a matter  b              b'   BIG MEDICINE.      67 of the merest conjecture, it is interesting to dwell upon the probable turn taken by his thoughts as he slowly stalked through the darkness and rain that night; but I shall not trench on what, knowing all that I do, seems sanctified and hallowed. It would be breaking a sacred confidence. Who has stood and watched for a form at a window? Who has expressed, in language more refined, to the inner fountain of human synpathy, the idea conveyed in the rough fellow's remark? Who that has, let him recall the time and the place holy in his memory. "Ther's wher I fust seed the gal," said the man, and went away to his lonely bed to dream the old new dream. All night the rain fell, making rich music on the roof and pouring through his healthy slumber a sound like the flowing of strange rivers in a land of new delights-a land into which he had strayed hand in hand with some one, the merest touch of whose hand was rapture, the simplest utter- ance of Whose voice was charming beyond expression.

We have all dreamed the dream and found it sweet. It is quite probable that no fence advertise- ments ever paidt as well, or stirred up as big a "muss" as those painted by Big Medicine onl the night mentioned heretofore. As an artist our Hoosier was not a genius, but he certainly understood how to manufacture a notoriety. If space permitted I would copy all those rude notices for your inspection; but I must be con- tent with a few random specimens taken froml  *memory, with an eye to brevity. They are characteristic of the man and in somewhat an index of the then state of society in and around Jimtown. On Deacon Jones's fence was scrawled the-following: "Dern yer ole sole, ef yer want good Koffy go to Cook &amp; Golding's nu stoar." John Butler, a nice old quaker, had the  following daubed on his gate: "Yu thievin'  duk-legged ya and iia ole cuss, ef the sperit muves ye, go git a broad-brimmed straw hat at Cook &amp; Golding's great stand at Jimtown." The side of William Smith's pig pen bore this: "Bill, ye ornery sucker, come traid with Cook &amp; Golding at the ole corner brick in Jim- town." Old Peter Grley found writing to the following effect on his new wagon bed: "Ef   BIG MEDICINE.      69 yoor dri or anything, you'll find a virtoous Kag of ri licker at Cook &amp; Golding's." On a, large plank nailed to a tree at Canaan's Cross Roads all passers by saw the followilg: "Git up an brindle! Here's yer ole and faithful mewl! Come in gals and git yer dofunny tricks and fixens, hats, caps, bonnets, parrysols, silk petty-coat-sleeves and other injucements too noomerous too menshen! Rip in-l-were on it! Call at Cook &amp; Golding's great corner brick!" These are fair specimens of what appeared everywhere. How one man could lhave done so much in one night remains a mystery. Some people swore, some threatened to prose- cute, but finally everybody welit to the corner brick to trade. Jimtown became famous on account of Big Medicine and the corner brick store. The sun rose through the morning gate be- yond the quagmires east of Jimtown and set through the evening gate past the ponds and maple swamps to the west. The winds blew and there were days of calm. The weather ran through its mutations of heat and cold. The herons flew over, the blue birds twittered, aud went away and came again, and the pee- wees disappeared and returned. A whole year had rolled round and it was June again, with4  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8053-00000036"/> 70  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICSo the air full of rumors about the building of a railroad through Jimtown. During this flow of time Big Medicine had feasted his eyes on the bright curls and bright- er eyes of Carrie Golding, ,till his heart; had be- come tender and happy as a child's. They rarely conversed more than for him to say, "4 Miss Carrie, look there," or for her to call out, "Please, Mr. Cook, hand me down this bolt of muslin." But Big Medicine was content. It wats Jane the 8th, about ten o'clock in the morning, and Big Medicine was slowly making his way from his comfortable bachelor's cabin to the corner brick. A peculiar smile was on his face, his heart was fluttering strangely, and all on account of a little circumstance of the preceding day, now fresh in his memory. Great boy that he was, he was poring over a single sweet smile Carrie Golding had given him! The mail hack stood at the post-office door, whence Mr. Golding was coming with a letter in his hand. Big Medicine stopped and looked up at the window. There stood Carrie. She was looking hopefully toward her father. Big Medicine smiled and murmured: "Ther's wher I fast seed the gal-bless her sweet soul!"There was a whole world of sin. cere happiness in the tones of his voice.   BIG VTMRICINE.      71 Mr. Golding passed him hastily, his green spectacles on his nose, and a great excitement flashing from his face. Big Medicine gazed wonderingly after his partner till he saw him run up stairs to Carrie's room. Then he thought he heard Carrie cry out joyfully, but it may have been the wind. When an hour had passed ir. Golding and Carrie came down dressed for travelling. How strangely, wondrously beautiful the girl now looked-! Mr. Golding was as nervous as an old woman. He rubbed his thin white hands together rapidly and said: Mr. Cook, I have glorious news this morn- ing!" "And what mought it be?" asked Big Medi- cine, as a damp chilliness crept over him, and his face grew pinched and almost as white as his shirt bosom. "Krofton &amp; Kelly, the bankers, have re- sumed payment, and ill get all my money! It is glorious news, isAt not, my friend?" Big Medicine was silent. -He tried to speak, but his mouth was dry and powerless. A mist drifted across his eyes. He hardly real- ized where he was or what was said, but he knew all. "I have concluded to give you this house and *       ,;*?"  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8053-00000037"/> 72  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAI(CS. all my interest in this store. You must not refuse. I haven't time to make the transfer now, but I'll not neglect it. Carrie and I must hasten at once to Cincinnati. The hack is waiting; so good bye, my dear friend, God bless you!"Mr. Golding wrung his partner's ' cold, limp hand, without noticing how fearfully haggard that Roman face had suddenly grown.  ' Good bye, Mr, Cook," said Carrie in her sweet, sincere way. "Im real sorry to leave you and the dear old house--but--but-good bye, Mr. Cook. Come to see-us in Cincinnati. Good bye." She gave him her hand also. He smiled a wan, flickering smile, like the %  last flare of a fire whose fuel is exhausted. g Carrie's woman's heart sank under that look,  though she knew not wherefore.  The hack passed round the curve of the road.  They were gone!  -  Big Medicine stood alone in the door of the  corner brick. He looked back over his shbul-  ders at thewell filled shelves and muttered: " She ain't here, and what do I want of the derned old store T?" The wind rustled the elm leaves and tossed the brown locks'of the man over his great fore- head; the blue birds sang on the roof; the   BIG MEDICINE.      73 dust rose in little columns along the street; and, high over head, in the yellow mist of the fine June weather, sailed a great blue heron, going to the lakes. Big Medicine felt like one deserted in the wilderness. He stood there a while, then closed and locked the door and went into the woods. A month passed before he returned. Jimtown wondered and won- dered. But when he did return his neighbors could not get a word out of him. He was silent, moody, listless. Where had he been? Only hunting for Mr. Golding and Carrie. He founl them, after a long search, in a splendid re idence on the heights just out of Cincinnati. Mr. Golding greeted him cordially, but some- how Big Medicine felt as though he were shaking hands with some one over an insur- mountable barrier. That was not the Mr. qolding he had known. "Carrie is out in the garden. She will be glad to see you. Go along the hall there. You will see the gate." Mr. Golding waved his hand after the man- ner of a very rich man, and a patronizing tone would creep into his voice. Somehow Big Medicine looked terribly uncouth.

Suddenly a vision, such as his fancy had never pictured, burst on his dazzled eyes. Flowers and vines and statues and fountains; on every hand rich colors; perfumes so mixed and in- tensified that his senses almost gave way';  long winding walks; fairy-like bowers and music.. He paused and listened. A heavy voice, rich and manly, singing a ballad-some popular love song-to the sweet accompani- ment of a violin, and blended through it all, like a silvery thread, the low sweet voice of Carrie Golding. The poor fellow held his breath till the song was done. Two steps forward and Big Medicine tow- ered above the lovers. Carrie sprang to her feet with a startled cry; then, recognizing the intruder, she held out her little hand and welcomed him. Turn- ing to her lover she said: "Henry, this is Mr. Cook, lately papa's partner in Indiana." The lover was a true gentleman, so he took the big hard hand of the visitor and said he was glad to see him. Big Medicine stood for a few moments hold- ing a hand of each of the lovers. Presently a tremor took possession of his burly frame. He did not speak a word. His breast swelled   BIG MDICINE.      75 and lis face grew awfully white. He put Carrie's hand in that of her lover and turned away. As he did so a tear, a great bitter drop, rolled down his haggard cheek. A few long strides and Big Medicine was gone. Shrilly piped the blue birds, plaintively sang the peewees, sweetly through the elms and burr oaks by the corner brick blew the fresh summer wind, as, just at sunset, Big Medicine once more stood in front of the old building with his eyes fixed on the vacant, staring win- dow. It was scarcely a minute that he stood there, but long enough for a tender outline of the circumstances of the past year to rise in his memory. A rustling at the broken lattice, a sudden thrill through the iron frame of the watching man, a glimpse of a sweet face-no, it was only a fancy. The house was still, and old and desolate. It stared at him like a death's head. Big Medicine raised his eyes toward heaven, which was now golden and :flashing resplend- ently with Sunset glories. High up, as if almost touching the calm sky, a great blue heron was toiling heavily westward. Taking the course chosen by the lone bird, Big Medi- cine went away, and the places that knew him once know him no more forever.  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8053-00000039"/> THE    NUS OF BALHNCH. WHEN I returned from Europe with a fin- ished education, I found that my fortune also was finished in the most approved modeln style, so I left New York and drifted westwiard  in search of employment. At length I came to Indiana, and, having not even a cent left, and mustering. but one presentable suit of clothes, I looked about me in a hungry, half desperate sort of way, till I pounced upon the school in Balhinch. Now Balhinch is not a town, nor a cross-road place, nor a post-office -it is simply a neighborhood in the southwest- ern corner of Union Township, Montgomery County-a neighborhood sui generis, stowedl  away in the breaks of Sugar Creek, containing as good, quiet, law-abiding folk as can be found anywhere outside of Switzerland.' My school was a small one in numbers, but the pupils ranlged froinfour to six feet three in altitude, and well proportioned. The most advanced class had thumbed along pretty well through -           i.    THE VENUS OF BATItTNCH.    77 \ the spelling book. I need not take up your time with the school, however, for it has noth- ing at all to do with my story, excepting merely to exllain how I came to be in Balhinch, in the State of Indiana. My first sight of Susie Adair was on Sunday at the Methodist prayer meeting. I was sit- ting with my back to a window and facing the door of the log meeting house when she en- tered. It was July-a hot glary day,. but a steady wind blew cool and sweet from the southwest, bringing in all sorts of woodland odors. The grasshoppers were chirruping in the little timothy field hard by, and over in a bit of woodland pasture a swarm of blue jays were worrying a crow, keeping up an incessant squeaking and chattering. The dumpy little class leader-the only little man in Ballinch -had just begun to give out the hymn "Love is the sweetest bud that blows, Its beauties never die, On earth among the saints it grows And ripens in the sky," &amp;c., when Susie came in. Ben Crane was sitting by me. He nudged me with his elbow and whispered: "Htow's that 'ere for poorty ." I made him no answer, but remained staring 7*  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8053-00000040"/> 78  A BOOK OP HOOSIER MOSAICS. at the girl till long after she had taken her seat., Nature plays strange tricks. Susie, the daugh- ter of farmer Adair, was as beautiful in the face as any angel could be, and her form was as perfect as that of the Cnidian Venus. Her motion when she walked was music, and as she sat in statuesque repose, the undulations of her queenly form were those of perfect ease, grace and strength. Her hands were small and taper, a little browned from exposure, as was also her face. Her hair was the real classic gold, and her grey eyes were riant with health and content. Whenl her red lips parted to sing j they discovered sinall even teeth, as white as ivory. I can give you no idea of her. Physically she was perfection's self in the mould of a Venus of tho grandest type. Her head, too, was an intellectual one (though feminine), in the best sense-of the word. Tile first thought that flashed across my mind was embodied in the words-A  Venus--and I still think of her as the best model I ever saw. "How's that for poorty? repeated Crane. "Who is she ' I replied interrogcatively. "She's my jewlarker," said he. "Your what?" "My sweetheart." What is her name i"   aTAiB VENUS OF BATTTToCH,   79 "Susie Adair."  So I came to know her and admire her, and even before that little prayer meeting was over I loved her. Introductions were an unknown institution in Balhinch, but I was not long in finding ta way to the personal acquaintance of Susie. I found her remarkably intelligent for one of her limited opportunities, very fond of reading, sprightly in conversation, womanly, modest, sweet tempered, and, indeed, alto- gether charming as well as superbly beautiful. As for me, I am an insignificant looking man, and then I was even more so, than now. My hair is terribly stiff and- red, you knew, and my eyes are very pale blue, nearly white. My neck is very long and has a large Adam's apple. I an small ad narrow chested, and hav/e slender bow legs. My teeth are uneven and my nose is pug. I have a very fine thin voice, decidedly nasal, as you perceive. One thing, however, I am well educated, polite, and not a bad conversationalist. Susie was a most entertaining and perplex- ing study for me onom the start. She treated1 me with decided consideration and kindness, seemed deeply interested in my accounts of my travels, asked me many questions about the old world and good society, sat for hours at a  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8053-00000041"/> 80  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. time listening to me as I read aloud. In fact I felt that I was impressing her deeply, but she' would go with Ben Crane, that long, awk- ward, ignorant gawk. How could a young woman of such fine magnetic presence, and en- dowed with such genuine, instinctive purity of taste in everything else, bear the presence of a rough greenhorn like that? Finally I said to myself: she is kind and good; she cannot bear to slight Ben, though she cares nothing for him.  What a strange state being in love is! It is like dreaming in the grass. One hears the flow of the wind-it is the breath of love-one smells the flowers, and it is the plerfume of a young cheek, the sharp fragralee of blonde curls. What dreams I had in. those days! I could scarcely endure my school to the end of the first three months. Then I gave it up, and collecting my wages purchased me some fine clothes--that is, fine for the time and the place. I recollect that suit now,and wonder how a man of my taste could have borne to wear it. A black coat, a scarlet vest and white pants, ending with calf boots and a very tall silk hat! If you should see me dressed that way now you would laugh till your ribs would hurt. I do not know how true it is, but, from a pretty   THE VENUS OF BAT rTNCH.    81 good source, I heard that Ben Crane said I looked like a red-headed woodpecker. One, thing I do know, I never saw a woodpecker with a freckled face. I have a freckled face. Ben soon recognized me as his rival and treated me with supreme impertinence, even going so far as to rub his fist under my nose and swear at me-a thing at which I felt pro- foundly indignant, and considering which I was surely justified in sticking a lucifer match into Bel's six valuable hay stacks one night thereafter. It was a great fire, and two hundred dollars loss to Ben. Let him keep his fist out from under my nose. But I must come to my story, cutting short thesQ preliminaries. It is a story I never tire of telling, and a story which has elicited ejacu- lations from many. It was a ripe sweet day in the latter part of September-clear, but hazy and dreamful-a prelude to the Indian summner. I stood before the glass in my room at 'Squire Jones's, where I boarded, and very carefully arranged my bright blue neck-tie. Then I combed my hair. I never have got thoroughly familiar with my hair.. I cannot, even now, comb it, while look- ing in a glass, without cringing for fear of burning my fingers. The long, wavy red locks  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC8053-00000042"/> 82  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS, flow through the comb like flames, and under- neath is a gleam of live coals and red hot ashes. Ben Crane said he believed my head had set his hay stacks a-fire. Maybe it did. I wished that a stray flash from the same source would kindle the heart of Susie Adair and heat it until it lay under her Cytherean breasts a puddle of- molten love. I put my silk hat carefully upon my head and wriggled my hands into a pair of kid gloves; then, walking-stick in hand, I set out to know my fate at the hands of Susie. My way was across a stubble field in which the young clover, sown in the spring, displayed itself in a variety of fantastic modes. Have you ever noticed how much grass is like water? Some one, Haw- thorne, perhaps, has spoken of ' a gush of violets," and Swinburne, going into one of his musical frenzies, cries: "Where tides of grass break into foam of flowers." I have seen pools of clover and streams of timothy; I have stood ankle deep in shoal blue grass and have watched for hours the liquid ripples of the red top. I have seen the field sparrows dive into the green waves of young wheat, and the black starlings wade about in the sink-foil of southern countries.   THE VENUS OF BALHNCH.     83 Grass is a liquid that washes earth's face till it shines like that of a clean, healthy child. But clover prefers to stand in pools and eddies, in Which oft and oft I have seen the breasts of meadow larks shine like gold, the while a few sweet notes, like rung silver, rose and trembled above the trefoil, all woven, in and out, through the swash of the wind's pal- pitant currents-a music of unspeakable in- fluence. Swallows skim the surface of grass just as they do that of water. When the sum- mer air agitates the smooth bosom of a broad green meadow field, you will see these little random arrows glancing along the emerald surface, cutting with barbed wings through the tossing, bloom-capped waves, thence ri-  cochetting high into the bright air to whirl and fall again as swiftly as before. Many a time I have traced streams of grass to their fresh fountains, where jets of tender foliage and bubbles of tinted flowers welled up from dark, rich earth, and flowed away, with a velvet rustle and a ripple like blown floss, to break and recoil and eddy against the dark shadows of a distant grove. Such a fountain is a place of fragrance and joy. The bees go thither to get the sweetest honey, and find it a very Hybla. The butterflies float about it  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8053-00000043"/> 84  A BOOK OF HOOSIER M OSAICS. in a dreamful trance, while in the cool, damp shade of a dock leaf squats a great toad, like a slimy dragon guarding the gate of a paradise.  As I slowly walked across that stubble fiell, now and then stepping into a tuft of clover, out front which a quail would start, whirling away in a convulsion of flight, I allowed dreams of bliss to steal rosily across my brain. I scarcely saw the great gold-sharded beetles that hummed and glanced in the mellow sun- light. I heard like one half asleep, as if far away, the sharp twitter of the blue bird and the tender piping of the meadow lark. Susie Adair was all my thought. I recollect that, just as I climbed the fence at the farther side of the clover field, I saw a'white winged, red headed woodpecker pounce upon and carry off a starry opal-tinted butterfly, and I thought how sweet it would be if I could thus steal away into the free regions *of space the olbject of my gentler passion. But then what wonder- ful big wiags I should have needed, for my Venus of the hollow of the hill of Balhinch was no airy thing. Her tall, strong body and magnificent limbs equalled one hundred and forty pounds avoirdupois! My own weight was about one hundred and twenty. As I neared Susie's home I began, for the     TiE VENUS OF BATIATNOCH.  85 first time in my life, to suffer from palpitation. Th, shadow of a doubt floated in the autumn sun-light. I set my teeth together and re- solved not to be faint hearted. I must go in boldly and plead my cause and win. When I reached the gate of the Adair farm- house I had to look straight over the head of a very large, sanctimonious-faced bull-dog to get a view of the vine covered porch. This dog looked up at me and smiled ineffably; then he came to the gate and stood over against me, peeping between the slats. I hesitated. About this time Ben Crane came out of the house with a banjo in his hand. He had been pla ing for Susie. He was a natural musician. 'Feared o' the dog, Mr. Woodpecker , said he. "Begone, Bull!" tand he kicked the big-headed canine aside so that I could go in. I heard him thrumming on his banjo far dcown the road as Susie ,met me at the door. How wondrously beautiful she was! "Sit down Mr.   , and, if you do not care, I'll bring the churn in and finish getting the butter while we talk." I was delighted-I was charmed-fascinated. Susie's father had gone to a distant village, and her mother, a gentle work-worn matron, ,                 s8  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8053-00000044"/> 86  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. was in the other room spinning flax, humming, meantime, snatches of camp meeting hymns. The sound of that spilinng-wheel seemed to me strangely mournful and sad, but Susie's deep, clear gray eyes and cheerful voice were the very soul of joyousness, health and youthl. She brought in a great fragrant cedar churn, made to hold six or eight gallons of cream, and forthwith began her labor. She stood as she worked, and the exercise throwing her entire body into gentle but well-defined motion, displayed all the riches of her contour. The  sleeves of her calico gown were rolled up above the elbows, leaving her plump, muscular arms bare, and her skirt was pinned away from her really small feet and shapely ankles in such a way as to give one an idea, a sug- gestion, of supreme innocence and grace. Her long, crinkled gold hair was unbound, hanging far below her waist, and shining like silk. Her lips, carmine red, seemed to overflow with tender utterances. Ever since that day I have thought churn- ing a kind ofsacred, charmingly blessed work, which ought to be, if really it is not, the pas- time of those delightfid beings the ancients called deities. Cream is more fragrant, more delicious, more potent than nectar or ambrosia. :         ^   THE VENUS OF BALHNOH.     87 A cedar churn is more delicately perfumed than any patera of the gods. And, I say it with reverence, I have seen, swaying lily-like above the churn, a beauty more perfect than that which bloomed full grown from the bright focus of the sea's ecstatic travail. What a talk Susie and I had that day! Slowly, stealthily I crept nearer and nearer to the subject burning in my heart. I watched Susie closely, for her face was an enigma to me. I never think of her and of that day without recalling Baudelaire's dream of a giantess. More happy than the poet, I really saw my colossal beauty stand full grown before me, but, like him, I wondered- * * * "Si son coeur couve une sombre flamme Aux humides brouillards qui nagent dans ses yeux." I could not tell, from any outward sign, what was going on in her heart. No sphinx could have been more utterly calm and myste- cious. She had a most baffling way about her, Coo. When at last I had reached the point of a confession of my maddening love, she broke into one of my charmingest sentences to say- "Mr. --  you'd better move farther away prom the churn or I might spatter your 3lothes."  This, somehow, disconcerted and bothered  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8053-00000045"/> 88  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. me. But Susie was so calm and sweet about it, her gray eyes beamed so mysteriously inno- cent of any impropriety, that I soon regained my lost eloquenceB .  tHow sharply and indelibly cut in my imem- ory, like intaglios in ivory, the surroundings of that scene, even to the minutest detail! For instance, I can see as plainly as then my new silk hat on the floor between my knees, containingr a red handkerchief and a paper of chewing tobacco. I recall, also, that a slip- trod shoe lay careened to one side near the centre of the room. The bull-dog camne to the door and peepedl solemnly in a time or two. A string of dried pumpkin cuts hung by the fireplace, and under a small wooden table in one corner were piled a few balls of " carpet rags." I sat in a very low chair. A picture of George Washington hung above -a small square window. The floor was ash boards un- carpeted. I heard some chickens clucking and cackling under the house. Finally, I recollect it as if it were but yes- terday, I said: "I love you, Susie-I love you, and I have loved you ever since I first saw you!" How tame the words sound now! but then they came forth in a tremulous murmur that   THE VENUS OF BALHNCI.    89 gave them character and power. Susie looked straight at me a moment, and I thought I saw  softer light gather in her eyes. Then she took away the churn dasher and lid and fetched a large bowl from a cupboard. What- a fine golden pile of butter she fished up'into the bowl! I drew my chair somewlat nearer, and watched her pat and roll and squeeze the plastic mass Wtth the cherry ladle. A little gray kitten came and rubbe d and purred round her. Again the bull-dog peeped in. A. breeze gathered some force and began to rip- ple pleasantly through the room. Far away in the fields I heard the quails whistling to each other. An old cow strolled up the lane by the house and round the corner of the orchard, plaintively tinkling her bell. Stead- ily hummed Mrs. Adairs spinning wheel. I slipped my hlat and my chair a little closer to Susie, and by a mighty effort directed my burning words straight to the point. I cannot repeat all I said. I would not if I could. Such thingSs are sacred. "Susie, I love you, madly,'blindly, dearly, truly! O, Susie! will you love me-will you be my wife ." Again she turned on me that strange, sweet, l " 8*  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8053-00000046"/> 90  4 BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. half smiling look. Her lips quivered. The flush on her cheeks almost died out. 't Answer me, Susie, and say you will make me happy." She walked to the cupboard, put away the bowl of butter and the ladle, then calme back and stood by the churn--and me. How in* describably charming she looked! She smiled strangely and made a motion with her round strong arms. I answered the movement. I spread wide my arms and half rose to clasp her to my bosom. A whole life was centred in the emotion of that moment. Stsie's arms missed me and lifted the churn. I sank back into my chair. How gracefully Susie swayed herself to her immense height, toying with 'the ponderous churn heldlfar above her head. I saw a kitten fairly fly out of the room, its tail as level as a iun barrel; I saw the bull-dog's face hastily wlithdxraw from the door; I saw the carpet balns, the pumpkin cuts and the print of Washington all through a perpendicu- lar cataract of deliciously fragrant buttermilk! I saw my hat fill up to the brinl, with my handkerchief afloat. I heaved an awful sigh and leaped to my feet. I saw old Mrs. Adair standing in the partition door, with her arms 4 akimbo, and heard her say-   THE VENUS OF BALHNCH.     91 "' W'y, Susan Jane Samawntha Ann! What 'pon airth hev ye done?" And the Venus replied l "I've been givin' this('ere little woodpecker a good dose of buttermilk.!" I seized my hat and shuffled out of the door, feeling the milk gush from the tops of my boots at each hasty step I mnade. I ran to the gate, went through and slammed it after me. As I did so I heard a report like the closing of a strong steel trap. It -was the bull-dog's teeth shutting on a slat of the gate as he made a dive at me from behind. I smiled grimly, thinking how I'd taste served in buttermilk. On my way home I passed Ben Crane's house. He was sitting at a wiundow playing his banjo, and singing in a stentorian voice: "O! Woodpecker Jim! Yer chance is mighty slim! Jest draw yer red head into yer hole And there die easy, dern your soul, O! slim Woodpecker Jim!" I was so mad that I sweat great drops of pure buttermilk, but over in the fields the quails whistled just as clear and sweet as ever, and I heard the wind pouring through the stubble as it always does in autumn!- o,  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8053-00000047"/> tHE EGEND OF pOTATO (REEK BIG yellow butterflies were wheeling, about in the drowsy summer air, and hovering above the moist little sand bars of Potato Creek. A shady dell, wrapped in the hot luth of Auguist, sent up the spires and domes of its walnut and poplar trees, clearly defined and sheeny, while underneath the forest roof the hazel adlld wild rose bushes had wrung themselves illto dusky mlats. Thle late violets bloomed here and there, side by side with those waxlike yellow blossoms, called by the country folk " butter and eggs." Through this dell Potato Creek meandered fantastically, washincg bare the roots of a few gnarled sycamores, and mur- muring among the small bowlders that almost covered its bed. It was not a strikingly romantic or picturesque place-rather the con- trary-much after- the usual type of ragged little dells. "A scrubby little holler" the neigh- borhood folk called it.   "EGEND OF POTATO CREEK.     93 Perclhed on the topmost tangle of the dry, tough roots of an old upturned tree, sat little Rose Turpin, sixteen that very August day; pretty, nay beautiful, her school life just end- ed, her womanhood just beginning to clothe her face and form in that mysterious mantle of tenderness-tlhe blossom, the flower that brings the rich sweet fruit of love. From her " high perch she leaned over and gazed down into the clear water of the creek and smiled at the gambols of the minnows that glanced here 'J aand thhre, now in shadowy swarms and anon glancing singly, like sparks of dull fire, in the limpid current.  Some small cray-fishes, too, delighted her with their retrograde and side- wise movements among the variegated pebbles at the bottom  of the water. A small sketch book and a case of pencils lay beside her. So busy was she with her observations, that a fretful, peevish, but decidedly masculine voice near by startled her as if from a doze. She had imagillned herself so utterly alone. "Wo-erp 'ere, now  caun't ye! Wo, I say! Turn yer ole head rouu' this Way now, blast yer ole picter! -* No foolin7, now, wo-erlp, I tell ye!

Of all dumnb things a horse was lose's favorite. Shepad always, since her very baby- hood, loved horses. "Wo-wo-wo-erp, here! LHan't ye got no sense at all?

The^ animal seemed unaware of any danger, but kept its head going from side to side, trying to fight certain bothersome gad-flies. "O, sir, stop; don't, don't; please, sir, don't!" cried the girl, her sweet voice breaking into silvery echo fragments in every nook of the little hollow. The man gazed all around, and, seeing no one, let fall the axe by his side. The birds, taking advantage of the silence, lifted a twit- tering chorts through the dense diark tops of the trees. The slimmest breath of air languidly caressed the leaves of the rose vines. The bubbling df the brook seemed to touch a mlellower key, and the yellow butterflies settled all together on a little sand bar. their bright wings shlut straight and sharp above their bodies. The man seemed intently listening. "Tw'an't mammy's voice, nohow," he muttered; "I but 1'd like to know who 'twas, thougl."

That was a critical moment for the lean, miserable horse. It loveered its head and held it quite still. The axe was steadily poised in tlhe air. I The man's face wore a look of deter- mination-grim, stone-like. He was, perhaps, twenty-five, tall and boLy, with a countenance sallow almost to greenness, sunken pale blue eyes, sun burnt hair, thin fiaxy beard, and irregular, half decayed teeth. Although his body and limbs were shrunken to the last de- gree of attenuation, still the big cords of his neck and wrists stood out taut, suggesting great strength. The blow would be a terrible one. The horse would. die almost without a struggle. "O, O, O! Indeed, sir, you must not! Stop that, sir, instantly! Yoa shall not do it, sir! O, sir!" And fluttering down from her perch, lose flew to the spot where the tragedy was pend- ing, and cast herself pale and trembling be- tween the horse-and its would-be executioner. The axe fell from the man's hands. His eyes became exactly circular. His under jaw dropped so that his mouth was open to its fallest gaping capacit y. His shoulders fell till their points almost met in front of lis sunken chest. Hewas a picture of overwhelming surprise.

His nose de- noted pugnacity, his lips sensuality, but not of a base sort, his eyes ignorance and rough kindness, his chin firmness, his jaw tenacity of purpose, and his complexion the ague. Ho had sworn to kill the horse, and kill him lie would. You could see tlat in-tle very wrin kles of his neck. He evidently felt that it was a duty he owed to his conscience-a duty made doubly imperative by the horse's reftsal to get well by the exact time prescribed.

The man's eyes got longest the short way as he gazed at the retreating figure. ' Well now, that's as cool as a cowcumber and twicet as juicy! Gal, ye'r' a brick! ye'r' a knot! Ye'r' a born pacer! Take 'im 'long for all I keer! Take 'im 'long!" He put down his axe, placed his hands against his sides and smiled, as he spoke, a big wrinkling smile that covered the whole of his sallow, skinny face and ran clear down to the neck band of his homespun shirt. "Pluck, no eend to it!" he muttered; 44 won- der who she is? Poorty-geeroody!" The wild birds sang a triumphant hymn, the breeze freshened till the whole woods rustled, and louder still rose the bubbling of the stream among its bo-lders. 4 Well, I'ljist be dorged!

The birds laughed, too, and still the windl freshened. The girl and the horse had quickly disap- peared behind the hazel and papaw bushes. Zach- Jones was alone with his axe and his re- flections. "Yender's where she sot-right up yender on that ole clay root. She must 'a' been a fishill', I reckon." Another admiring chuckle. He went to the spot and clambered up among the roots. There lay vose's sketch book and pencil case. He took up the book and curiously turned the leaves, his eyes running with some- thing like childish delight over the flowers and bits of landscape. He had never before seen a drawing. "Poorty as the gal 'erself, 'most," he said, "t an' seein' 'at she's tuck my ole hoss, I spose I'll have to take these 'ere jimcracks o' her'n. I'll take 'em 'long anyhow, jist to 'member her by 1"  - This argument seemed logical and conclu- sive, and with a quick glance over his shoulder he crainmed book and pencil case into the capacious depths of the side pocket of his pants.   "EGEND OF POTATO CREETK.   101 " Now then it's about time for my chill, an' I'd better go home. Hang the luck; s'pose I'll allus have the ager!"This last sentence was uttered ill a tone of comical half despair, and accompanied by a facial contortion possible to no one but a person thoroughly saturated with ague in its chronic form. After he left the dell, Zach had a hot walk across a clover field before he reached the dilapidated log house where he lived with his widowed mother. In a shortftime his chill set inl, and it was a fearful one. His teeth chat- tered and his bony frame rattled like a bundle of dry sticks in a strong wind. After it hadl shaken him thus for about an hour, his brother Sammy, a lad of ten years, came in with a jug of buttermilk brought from a neighbor's. Mammy, er e's yer buttermilk," said he, setting the jug on the floor. ,Shakin' like forty--a'n't ye, Zach?" he added, glancing with a sad, lugubrious smile at his brother; then, changing his tone and also his colute- nance, he continued, withl a broader grin: "-Bet ye a dollar ye can't guess what I seed over to 'Squire Martin's!" "No, nor I don't care a cuss; so put off an' don't come yawpin' round me!" replied Zach.

"'Mammy,--ef you an' Sammy 'll jist let me 7joy this 'ere ager in peace I'll be orful Mbleeged to ye7" said Zach, making his cllair creak and quiver withl the ecstasy of his convulsion.

When his mother was not loolking at him, how- /   "EGEND OF POTATO CREEK.    103 ever, he would occasionally slip the sketch book partly out of his pocket and peep be- tween its leaves. When his fever came on he got " flighty'7 and horrified the, widow withl talk about an angel on a clay root and a sweet little&amp;' boss thief" from whom he had stolen the, " picters!" I cannot exactly say how Zach got to going over to 'Squire Martin's so often after this. But his first visit was a compulsory one. His mother happening to discover his possession of the sketch book and pencil case, made him return them with hs own hand to Rose. He at once became deeply interested in the pro- gress of his former patient's convalescence; for, strange to say, the poor hlorse began al- most immediately to get well, and in two months wars sound, glossy and fat. Nor was he an ill- looking animal. On the contrary, when Iose sat on his back and stroked his mane, lie arched his neck and pawed the ground like a thorough- bred. 'Squire Martin was a good man, and seeing how Zach seemed to enjoy Rose's company, he one day took the girl aside and said to her: "You must be somewhat of a doctor, nmy dear, seeing how you've touched up the old hoss, and I propose for you to try your hand  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8053-00000053"/> 104: A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. \ on another subject. There's poor Zach Jones, who's had the chills for six or eight years as constant as sunrise and sunset, and no medi- cine can't do him any good.

Now I propose to let Zach have a hoss and saddle and you zmust go out a riding with 'im ancl try to divert his mind from his sorrows and aches and pains-now that's a good girl, Rosie." Rose, whose healthful, impulsive, generous -ature would not allow her to refiuse so well intended and withal so small a request, readily agreed to do all she could in the matter, and very soon thereafter she and Zach were the very best of friends, taking loug rides together through woodlands and up and down the pleas- ant lanes of 'Squire Martin's broad estates. The young girl soon found the companionship of Zach,' novel and most awkward as it was at   "EGEND OF POTATO CREEK.     105 first, agreeable and almost charming in its freshness and sincerity. As for Zach himself, he was flle girl's slave from the start. He could not do too much for ller in his earnest, respectful way. Women are always tyrants, and their tyranny seems to be inversely as their size and directly as the size of the man upon Whol it is exerted. Rose was a very little chit of a maiden, tand Zach was a great big bony fraime of a fellow. The result, of course, was despotism.  But, althougll Zack was a democrat, he seemed to like the oppres- sion, and ran after big-wingred  butterflies,. openled gates, pulled down and put up, innumer- able fees, climbed trees after empty bird nests, gathered flowers and ferns--did every- thing, in fact, required of him by his little queen.  He  became a daily visitor at the 'Squire's, and seemed to have entirely forgot- ten everything else or utterly submerged it in his unselfish devotion to the girl.

Meanwhile a remarkable change haid takiel place in the health and spirits of' Zach Jones. The afgue had departed, the sallowness was gone fro:n his skin, somewhat of 'flesh had gathered on his cheeks, and in his eyes slione a cheerfull light. He was straight and almost plump, and 'his hair and beard had assumned a gloss and liveliness they had never before knowni . He had thrown away quilfine and calomnel, and his sleep at'night was soft and sweet, broken only by fair, happy dreams, that lingered long after he was awake.' At home his mother had- far less trouble with hm, aid Sammy never got a kick even if he did occasionally me:atiou old fistleo in an equivocal way. The amount of provender it required to satisfy Zach's appetite now was a constant source of amazetent to the widow. The evening preceding Rose's departure was a fine one. The woods were goldl, the sky was turquoise. Insteatdof riding, as usual, the young people took a stroll in the 'Squirels immense orchard. The apples were ripe Cand ready to be gathered into the cellars; their mellow fra- grance flavored the autumn air so delicately that Zach said it smelt sweeter than an oven full of sugar cakes.   "EGEND OF POTATO CREWir.   107 W^hen the young folk rettrned from their walk the 'Sqire was standing on the door step of his house. His quick eyes caulght a glimpse   n of something unsatisfactor in the faces of t he approaching couple--Zach, par- ticularly despite his evidlenteffort to choke down something7 discovered unmistakable signs of sufftring.

A  bunch of fall roses fell fromn his vest button hole, but he did not pick it up. A hot flush, inl the midst of a ghastly pallor burned on the cheeks of the speaker..

Next morning Rose went home to the city and soon after made a brilliant debut in society, for she was really a charming little thing. That winter was a festive one-a season of great social activity-and some of its most direct and prominent results were a few notable marriages in the spring, among which was that of Rose to a banker of P--, Kentucky, the hlappvy union being consummated in May. On the very day of her weddiog Rose re- ceived from her uncle the following note: "DEAR NIECE: "Come to see us, even if you won't stay but one day. Come right off, if you're a Christian girl. Zach Jones is dying of conlsumption and is begging to see you nighlt and day. He says he's got something on his mind he wants to say to you, and when he says it lie can die happy. The poor fellow is monstrous bad off, and I think you ought to be sure and come. We're all well. Your loving uncle, "JARED MARTIN." Something in this homely letter so deeply affected Rose that she prevailed on her bus- band, a few days after their nmarriage, to take her to 'Squire Martin's. It was nearly sundown -when the young   "EGEND OF POTATO CREEK.    109 wife, accompyanied by the 'Squire, entered the room of the dlying man. He lay on a low bed by an open window, through whcl, with hollow hungry eyes, he, was gazing into the blue dis- tance that is called the sky of May. Birds were singing in the trees all around the hlouse, and a cool breath of violet-scented air rippled through the window. The widow Jones, worn out with watching by the sick bed, sat sleep- ing in her rude arm-chair ; Sammy had gone after the cow--a gift from the 'Squire. The visitors entered softly, but Zach heard them and feebly turned his hea(d. He put out a bloodless hand and clasped the warm fingers of Rose, pulling her into a seat by his couch. A wan slnile flitted across his face as he fix- ed his eyes, burning like sparks in the gray ash of a spent fire, on her's, dewy with rising tears.  The same little Rose you use to wus!" he said, in a-low faltering voice, that had in it an unconquerable allegiance to the one dream of his manhood.  His unnaturally brilght eyes ran swiftly over her fiace and form, then closed, as if to fasten the vision within, that it might follow him to eternity.  The same little EIose you use to wus," he repeated, ' only now you're picked off the vine 10  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC8053-00000056"/> "O  A BOOK OF HOOSIER :IOSAICS. an' nobody can't touch ye but the owner.

A few moments of utter silence followed, during whhich, faintly, fair out in the field be- hind the house, was heard the childish voice of Sammy, singingr an old hynn, two lines of which were most distinctly heard by those in -the house. ' Ah, yes-- "This world's a wilderness of woe,  This world it ain't nly home," chimed in the trembling voice of the sick lman. Then, by an effort that evidently taxed his fading powers to the last de(gree, lie fixed his eyes- firmnly on those of the young woman. Here was a martyr of the divine sort, true and unchalngeable in the flame of the torture. "Iose, little Rose," he sail, glancing un- easily at the 'Squire, 4I've got something private like to say to you." The young woman trembled,. Memorywas at work. "SSquiire, go out a minute, will ye?' con- tinued Zach.- The sick man's request was promptly obeyed,   "EGEND OF POTATO' CREEK.   1ll and Ro e sat, drooping, alone beside the bed, while the widow snored away. Zach now more nervously clasped the hand of the young woman. A spot of faint sunshine glimmered on tlme pillow close by the man's head. The out-door sounds of the wind in the young grass, and the rustle of the new soft leaves of the trees, crept into the room gently, as if not to drown the low voice of the dying  i   I tsmani.

He turned away his face and drew just one little fluttering breath. When, after only a few minutes' absence, the 'Squire came in, the widow still slept, the sweet air still rippled throug!h the room, but Rose held a (dead hand; Zach was at- rest! The 'Squire placedl his hand on the bright hair of Rose and gazedl mournfilly down into the pinched, pallid face of the dead. How awfully calm a dead flace is! The widow stirred ill her chair, groanedt and awoke. For a momnent' she bent her eyes wonderingly, iliquiringly on the young wo- man; then, rising, she clasped her in her great bony arms. "You are the Rose, the little Rose he's been goill' on so Labout. O holley, I'm orful glad you've come. You ort jist to 'a' heerd him talk about ye when he got flighty like-- but O--0-m-y! O Lor'!

Across the fields of young green wheat ran waves of the spring wind, lmulrmuring and sighing, while the dust of blossoms wheeled, and rose and fell in the last soft rays of the going sun. A big yellow butterfly flitted through the room.   "EGEND OF POTATO CREEK.    113 Presently Samllmy entered. He came in like a gust of wind, making things rattle with his impetuous motion. ' , mammy!

"Here come the train slowly backing down, the brakesman a swinging lanterns, and the passengers all swarming onto the platforms. Poorty soon they stopped right opposite us.

THE hiouse was known as Rackenshack throughout the neighborhood for miles around. It was a frame structure, originally of sorry worklimanship, at least thirty years old, and upon which not a cent's worth of repairing had been done since first erected, wherefore the name was peculiarly appropriate. It was not only old, rickety, paintless, half rotten and sadly sunken at one end, but the fencing around the place was broken, grown over with weeds, and slanted in as many ways as there were panels. The lawn or yard, in front of the house had some old cherry trees, gnarled and decaying, growing in what had once been straight rows, but storms and more insidious vicissitudes had twisted and curled them about till they looked as though they had been thrown end foremost at the ground hap-hazard. Under and all round these triees young sprouts, from the scattered cherry seeds of many years of fruiting, had grown so thick that one could with difficulty get through them.

A country thoroughfare, one of the old Stat( roads leading westward to a ferry on the Wa bash river near the village of Attica and east ward to either Crawfordsville, Indianlapolis oI Lafayette. 'hisroad was in the direct line oi emigration, and in the proper seasons long lines of covered wagons rolled past, the drivers, a jolly set, hallooing to each other and bandying sharp wit and rude sarcasm at the expense of Reackenshack. Poor old house, it leered at the passers, with its windows askew, and clattered its loose boards and battered shutters in utter and complacent defiance of -all their jeers! Rackenshack belonged to Luke Plunkett and Betsy, his sister; the latter an old maid beyond all cavil, the former a bachelor of about thirty. The lands of the estate were pretty broad, comprising some two thousand acres of rich prairie and " river bottom" land, which had been kept in a much better state of im- provement than the house had. In fact, Luke was considered a careful, industrious, frugal farmer. He had large, well regulated barns   HOIDEN.        12.9 and stock sheds and stables-plenty of fine hllorses, cattle, hogs, sheep and mules, all well fedl andcl cared for, and it was generally under- stood that he hadl a pretty round deposit in a bank. Perhaps Squire Rube Fink, sometimes called "the Rev. Major Fink"' and sometimes u Tallk- ing nalRbe, gives the best description of Luke's condition, habits and surroundings, that I can offer. It is truthful and singularly graphic, He says: "Luke Plunkett's no fool if he does live at Rack-a-mle-shack and Ispect the ole rotten tab- ernacle to fall down on hfim every time a roos- ter cronrs close by. That feller's long-headed, he is.

He has his own way. He's so quiet and peculiar; a still, say nothin', bull-dog sort o' man he is."' Indeed, Luke was one of that quiet sort of men who, without ever once loudly asserting a right or disputing any word- you say, invari- ably go ahead on their own judgment and carry their point in everything. Nevertheless, he was a man of fine, generous nature at bottom, a good brother anld a worthy friend. But it was with Luke just as it is, more or less, with us all. He absorbed into his life the spirit of his surroundings. He grew somewhat to resemble Rackenshack in outward appear- ance. He became slovenly in his dress and let his hair and beard grow wild. His natu- rally handsome face gradually took on a sort of good humored ugliness, and his heavy shoulders slanted over like the uneven gables of his house He became an inveterate chewer and smoker of tobacco. What time a quid of the weed was not in his mouth, the short thick stem of a dark, nicotine-coated briar-root pipe took its place there. Luke was an early riser; therefore it hap- pens that our story properly begins on a fine June morning, just before sunrise. The birds seemed to suspect that a story was to date   HOIDEN.       131 from that hour, for they were up earlier than usual and made a great rustle of wings and a sweet Babel of voices in the old cherry trees. There were the oriole, the cat bird, the yellow throat, the brown thrush and the red bird, all pltting forth at onllce their charmingest efforts. The old cherry trees, knee deep in the foliage of their under growing seedlings, gleamed dusky green in the early light, as -Luke, bare- headed, barefooted and in his " shirt sleeves ,' as the phrase goes, issued from the front door of Rackenshack, aud walked down the path across the yard to the gate at the, road. Of late he had been in the habit of "taking a smoke " the first thintg after getting up in the I mornig, and somehow the gate, though off one hinge and having doubtful tenure of the other, was his faivolrite thing to lean upon while watching the whiffs of blue smoke slowly float away. On this particular morning he seemed a lit- tle agitated; and, indeed, he was vexed more deeply than he hiad ever before been. Just the preceding evening he had learned that a corps of civil engineers were rapidly approach- ilg his ]premises with a line of survey, and that the purpose was to locate and build a railway right through the middle of his farm.  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC8053-00000067"/> 1'32  A BOOKI OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. To Luke the very idea was outrageous. He --felt that he could never stand such an imposi- tion. His land was his own, and when he wanted it dug up and leveled down and a track laid across it lie would do it himself. He did not want his farm cut in two, his fields dis- arranged and his fences moved, nor did he wish to see his live stock killed by locomotives. The truth is he was bitterly opposed to rail- roads, anly how. They were innovations. They were enemies to liberty. They brought fashion, and spendthrift ways, and speculation, and all that along with them. Other folks might have railroads if they wanted them, but they, must not bother him with them. He could take care of his affairs without any railroads. Besides, if he wanted one he could build it. He hung heavily upon the gate, thinking the matter over, and would not have bestowed a second glance' at the carriage that came trundling past if he had not caught the starry flash of a pair of blue eyes and a rosy, roguish girl's face within. The beauty of that countenance struck the great rough fellow like a blow. He stared in a dazed, bewildered way. He took his pipe from his mouth and involuntarily tried to hide his great big bare feet behinml the gate post. He felt a quee'r, dreamy thrill steal all over   HOIDEN.       133 him. It was his first definite impression of feminine beauty. Instantly that round, happy, mischievous face, with its dimples and inde- scribable shining lines of half latent mirth, set itself in his heart forever. The carriage trundled on in the direction of the ferry. Luke followed it with his eyes till it disappeared round a turn in the road; then he put the pipe to his mouth again and began puffing 'vigorously, wagging his head in a way that indicated great confusion of mind. There are times when a glimpse of a face, the sud- den hlalf-imasteriu4 of a new, grand idea, a view of a rare landscape or even a cadence in some new tune, will start afresh the long dried up wells of a heart. Something like this had happened to Luke.  Silti a gal! sich a gal!" he murmured from the corner of his mouth opposite his pipe stem. ,' I doll't guess I'n a dreamin' now, though I feel a right smart like it. "I hev dreamed of that 'ere face though, many of times. I've seed it in my sleepy a thousand times, but I never s'posed 'atlJd see it shore enough when I'd be awake! Sweetest dreams I ever had-- sweetest face God ever made! I wonder who she is?"As if to supplement Luke's soliloquy- : at this point, a cardinal red bird flung out -   12  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC8053-00000068"/> 134  A BOOK Or HOOSIER MOSAICS. from the dusky depths of the oldest cherry tree an ecstatic carol, anrd a swallov, swooping down from the clear purple heights, almost touched the man's cheek with its shining' wings, and the sun lifted its flaming face in the east and flooded the fields with goll. Luke turned slowly towatird the old house, The breeze that came up with the sun poured through the orchard withl a broadl, joyous surge, while something like blowing of strange winds and streaming of soft sunlight ma(e! strangely happy the inner woild of the smlit- ten Hoosier. His big strong hleart fluttered mysteriously. He actually tookl his pipe friom his lips and broke into 'a snatch of merry song, that startled Betsy, his sister, from her morn- ing nap. For the time the hated railroad survey was forgotten. The landscape at Rackenshack, as if by a turn of the great prisms of nature, suddenly took on rainbow hues. The fields flashed with jewels, and the woods, a wall of dusky emerald, were wrapped in a -roseate mist, stirred into dreamy motion by the breeze. A light, grateful fragrance seemned to pervade all space, as if flung from the sun to soften and enhance the charm of his gift of light and heat. Such a hold did all this take upon Luke, and   HOIDEN.       135 so utterly abstracted was he, that when break- fast was ready Betsy was obliged to remind him of the act that he had neglected to wash his face and hands, and- comb his hair and beardl-things absolutely prerequisite to eating at her table. "Forgot it, sure's the world," said Luke; "don't know what ever possessed me.:' "' Maybe you've forgot to turn the cows into the milk stalls, too?" said Betsy. "'If I htln't I'm a gourd!" and Luke scratched his head distractedly. "What 'd I tell you, Luke Plunkett? It's come at last, O lordy! You're as crazy as a June bug all along of smoking that old pipe! Rot the nasty, stinking old thing! It's a per- fect shame, Luke, for a man to just smoke what little brains he's got clean out. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, so you ought!" While she was speaking Betsy got the big wooden washbowl for her brother, whereupon he proceeded to make his ablutions in a most energetic way, taking up great- double hand- fuls of water and sousing his 'face therein with loud puffings, that enveloped his head in a cloud of spray. When a clean tow linen towel had served its purpose, Ltuke remarked:  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC8053-00000069"/> 136  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. "Don't know but what I am some'at crazy in good earnest, Betsy, since I come to think it all over. I'm r'ally onut it a right smart. 'What 'd you think, Betsy, if I'd commence talkin' 'oman to ye ."T "Luke, Luke! are you cra zy     Is your mind clean gone out of your poor smoky head ?"- "' That's not much of a answer to my ques- tion." ' Well, what do you mean, anyhow ?" "I mean business, that's what!" " Luke !" " Yes " "Do try to act sensible now. What is it, Luke ? What makes your eyes look so strange and dance about so ? What do you mean by all this queer talk T" Luke finished combing, and, going to the table, sat down and was proceeding to discuss the fried chicken and coffee without further remark, but Betsy was not so easily balked. She, like most red haired women, wished her questions to be, fully and immediately aln- swered, wherefore some indications of a storm began to appear. Luke smiled a quiet little smile that had hard work getting out through his beard.   HOIDEN.        137 Betsy trotted her foot under the table. Her hand trembledl as she poured the coffee-trem- bled so violently that she scalded- her left 'thumb. It was about time for ul;uke to speak or have trouble, so, in a very gentle voice, he said:  "Well, I saw a gal-a gal an' her father, I recklon-go by this mornin'." "Well, what of it?  S'pose there's plenty of girls and their fathers, ain't there-? snapped  Betsy. Luke drew a chicken leg through his mouthl, laid down the bone, leered comically at his sister from under his bushy eyebrows, and saidt  "' But the gal was purty, Betsy-purtJy as a pictur', sweet as a peach, juicy an' temlptin' as a ripe, red cored watermillion! You can't begin to guess how sweet an' nice she did look. My heart just flolloped and floppedl about, an' it's at it yet!" '(Luke Plunk ett, you are crazy!

He always carried his guni with him on such occasions, and not unfrequently brought back a brace of partridges or some young squirrels. As he strode along, thinking all the time -of the girl in the carriage, he sudden- ly came upon a corps of engineers with transit, level, rod and chain, staking out, through the centre of a choice field, a lille of survey for a railroad. In an instant he was like a roaring lion. He glared for a second or so at the in- truders, then lowering his gun he charged them at a run, storming out as he did so: "What you doin' here, you oneiy cusses, you! ,Leave here! Get out! Scratuch! Sift! Dern yer onery skins, I'll shoot evtery dog of ye! Git out hn here, I say--out, out!" The corps stampeded at once. Tihe surveyor seized his transit, the leveller his level, the rod man his rod, the axe men/and chalill men their respective implements, (nl 'away they went, "lick-to-split like a passeb9' scart hogs," as Luke afterwards said, ';as fast as they could ever wiggle along!" No wonder they ran, for Luke looked like a demon of destruction. It was a wild race for   HOIDEN,       139 the line fence, a full half mile away. The leveler, being the hindmost man, rolled over this fence just as a heavy bowlder, hurled by Luke, struck the top rail. It was a close shave, a miss of a hair's breadth, a marvelous escape. Luke rushed up to the fence .and glared over at his intenlded victims. Here he knew he must stop, for he doubted the legality of pur- suing them beyond the confines of his own premises. Somewhat out of breath he leaned on the fenlce and proceeded to swear at the corps individnally and collectively, shaking his fists at them excitedly, till the appearance of a inew mnan on the scene made him start and stare as if looking at a ghost. He was a well dressed, gentlenmanly appearing person of about the age of forty-five, pale and thoughtful- calm, gray eyed, commanding. Luke recog- nized him at once as the Inan he had seen in the carriage, and, indeed, the vehicle itself stood hard by, with a beautifill, laughing, roguish face looking out of one of the windows. The lion in the stalwart farmer was quelled in an instant. He felt his legs grow weak. He set hiA gun by the fence and touched his hat to the little lady. "Your name, I believe, is Luke Plunkett?" said the approaching gentleman.  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC8053-00000071"/> "O  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. "YesY,-sir,' said Luke.

Pull back, men (address- ing the corps), pull back to where you dropped tle line and bring it right along. M3r. Plunkett will not harm you how." The corps began to move. Luke fiercely seized his gun; but before he could lift it or utter a word, a ten-inch Colt's repeater was thrust into his face by the calm gentleman, and a steady hand held it there. "Mr. Plunkett," said the man, "I am the chief engineer of the, - Railroad. I ant making a location. The laws of this- State give me the right to go upon your land with my corps and have the survey mnade. I am not to be trifled with. If you offer to cock that gun I'll put six holes through you. What do you say, now?. The voice was that of a cold man of busi- ness. There was a coffin in every word. The muzzle of the pistol steadily covered Luke's left eye. The situation was rigid.

"Shoot hm, papa, shoot him! Shoot him!" Sweet as a silver bell rang out the girl's voice, more like a ripple of idle song than a murder- ous request, and then a clear, happy laugh went echoingoff through the woods in which the carriage' stood. Slowly, steadily, Luke let fall the breech of his gun upon the ground beside him.  The engineer stmiled grimly and lowered his pistol,. while the corps, headed by the surveyor, took up its line of march to the point where work had; been so suddenly left off. The young lady clapped her tiny white hands for joy. A big black woodpecker began to cackle in a tree hard by. Luke Melt like a man in a dream. The whole adventure, so far, had been: clothed in most unreal seeming. It can hardly be told how, by rapid transi-. tions firom one thing to another in his talkr the engineer drew Luke's mind away from the late difficulty and gradually aroused in him a kindly feeling. In less than ten minutes the two men were sitting side by side on a log,. ^  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC8053-00000072"/> "2  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. smoking cigars from the engineer's pouch and chatting calmly, amicably. Luke'steyes often rested steadily fixed in the direction of the carriage. Through the thin veil of tobacco smoke the face of the young' girl seemed to the farmer angelic in its beauty. All around the sweets of summer rose andl fell, and drifted lilke scarcely visible shining mists, fraught with the spice of leaf and per- fume of blossom, agitated by swells of tricksy wind, going on and on to the mysterious goal of the season. The two men talked on until the corps had puslled the line of survey far past them into the cool, shady deeps of the woods, whence their voices came back fainter and fainter every moment. At length the enginleer arose, and stretching out his hand to Luke, said: "Mr. Plunkett, I'm sure I'll be able to serve you some time ; let us be friends. I shall be in this vicinity most of the time till the road is built. No doubt I can show a way to profit by  the construction of a railroad across your land. If you are sharp it will make your forttune. I like your independent way, sir, and hope to know you better. Here is my card." Luke took the bit of pasteboard without saying a word. They shook hands and the engineer got into his carriage.  HOIDEN.       143 "Here's my card, too, Mr. Plunkett," cried -the girl. She said something more, but the horses were made to plunge rapidly away, and the words were lost; but the flash of a white jewelle d hband caught Luke's eye as a delicately tinted card came fluttering towards him. He sprang and seized it, If a l1ag of diamonds had been flung at lhis feet lhe could not have been more excited. His lhnds trembled. All the incidents of the only fairy tale he had ever read came at once into his mind. He stood with his feet turned in, ilke some great awk- ward boy, a bashful, shamc-fticed look lurking about his mouth and eyes. He filled his pipe and lighted it from the stump of his cigar with nervous eaqerness. A  squirrel came down to the lowest limbs of a beech tree hard by and barked at him but lie did not notice it. He read the names on the cards: - Elliot Pearl, C. E." "Hoiden Pearl." The first printed in small capitals, the second written in ,a delicate, rather cramped feminine hand.   He stood for a long time dreamily em- ployed in turuiug these bits of paper over and over. His thoughts were so vague in outline and so dim in filling up that they cannot be reproduced.

Finally, shakling, himself as if to break the charm that held him in its meshes, he toolktp his gun and slowly made his way homeward. All along his walk he kept smiling to himself and talking aloud, but his words were such that it would be sacrilege to repeat them now. Let them hover about in the sunlight of summer, where he uttered them, as things too delicate to be pressed between the lids of a book. Betsy had trouble with Luke for some days after this. He lay about the lhouse, saying litre, I eating little, giving little attention to the many tenants who worked his estate. He was in good health, was not in trouble (so he said to his sister), but he did not care to be bothered with business. He was tired and would rest awhile. "He smoked pretty near all the time," as Betsy declared. But not a hint fell from his lips as to what might be running in his mind. So the days slipped past till July hung golden mists on the horizon and filled the woods with that rare stillness and dusky slumbrousness that follows the maturing of the foliage and the coming on of fruit. The cherry trees at Rack- enshack had grown ragged and dull, and the   noIDEN.       145 birds, excepting a few swallows wheeling about the old chimney tops, ]bad all flown away to the woods and fields. The wheat had been cut and stacked, the corn had receivedl its last ploughing. Still Luke hung about the house annoying Betsey with his pilpe and his utter carelessness. That he was " distracted "Betsy did not for a moment doubt. She used every mneans her small stock of wit could invent to urge him out of his singular mood, but with- out avail. He took to the few oll nlovels he could find about the house, but sometimes he would gaze blankly at a single paragraph for a whole hourr.            1 One morning as he lay on the porch, his head resting upon the back of a chair, reading, or pretending to read anl odd volume of ' The Scottish Chiefs," a little boy, 'Squire Brown's son, came to bring home a monkey-wrench his faither had borrowed some time before. The boy was a bright, rattle-box, say-everything, pop-eyed sort of child, and was not long tell- ing all the news of the neighborhood. Luke gave little attention to what he was saying, till at length he let fall something about a young lady-a fine, rich young lady, staying at Judge Barnett's-a young lady who could out- run him, out jump him, beat him playing mar- 4"   13  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC8053-00000074"/> "6  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. bles and ball, wlho could climb away up in the June apple tree, who could ride a colt bare- back, who could beat Jim Barnett shooting at a mark, who could, in fact, do a half a hundred things to perfection that strict persons would think a young lady should never do at all, but which seemed to make a heroine of her in the narrator's boyish view. 4"What's the gal's name ." queried Luke in a slow, lazy way, but his eyes shot a gleam of hope. "Hoidy Pearl," replied the lad. Hoiden Pearl! That name had been woven into every sound that had reached Luke's ears for days and nights and nights together, atnd now, like a sweet tune nearly mastered, it took a deeper, tenderer meaning as the boy pro- nounced-it in his childish way. "Hoidy Pearl is her name," the lad con- tinued. "She's come to stay at the Judge's all summer till the new railroad's finished. Her father's the boss of the road. She's jest the funniest girl, o-o-e! And she likes me, too!" Luke raised himself to a sitting posture and looked at the boy so earnestly that he drew back a pace or two as if afraid. "' Boy, you're not lyin', are ye?" said the man in a low, earnest tone.   HOIDEN.       147 No I'm not, neither," was the quick reply. Luke got up, flung aside his book and strolled off into the woods. Wandering there in the cool, silent places, he dreamed his dream. For hours he sat by a little spring stream in the dense shadow of a big cotton-wood tree. The birds congregated about lim, and chirped and sang; the squirrels came out chattering and frisking from branch to branch; but he gave them no look of recognition-he saw them not, heard them not. Tlhe birds mighl have lit upon his head and the squirrels. mnight have run in and out of lhis pockets with ilpDunity. He smoked all the time, refilling alnd relight- ing his pipe whenever it burned out. He did not know how much he was smoking, nor that he was smoking at all. A bright face set in a mass of yellow curls, a wee white hand all spangled with jewels, a voice sweeter than any bird's, a name--Hoiden Pearl-these rang, and lanced, and echoed, and shone in the re- cesses of his brain and heart to the exclusion of all else. He was trying to think, but he could not." He wanted to mature a plan, but not even atl outline could find'room in his head. It was full. Strange, indeed,it may seem, that a rough farmer of Luke's age should thus fall into the ways of the imaginative, sentimental  ; , q   &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC8053-00000075"/> "8  A BOOIC OF HOOSIE   MOSAICS. stripling,; but, after all, the fit must come on some time in life. No doubt it goes harder with some constitutions than with others. Luke may have bIeei unwittingly strongly p)re- disposed that. way. Neither the exterior of a man nor his surroundings will do to judge him by. Nature is that mysterious in all her ways. Luke talked aloud, sometimes gesticu- latiug in a quiet way. "I must see the gal--I will see the gal," he muttered ait last. "It's no use talkin', I jist will see her!" Suddenly a light broke fromn his face He smiled like one who has victory in ]his grasp- like an editor whlo has anl idea like a reviewer who has found some bad verse. He got up immediately, went back to the barnl, itched a horse to a small road wagon and drove to town. There he spent time and money with a ner- chant tailor and otlher veldors of clothing. He was very fastidious in his selectionl. Noth- ing but the finest would do hldl. A few (days after this-he brought lhomee a trunk full of princely raieneit--broad cloth and fine linen. Betsy was struck dumb with amazement when the trunk was opened. A dream of such costly things, such reckless extravagance, would have driven her mad. --Silent, open-eyed, wondering, '  . ,   HOIDEN.       149 she came in and stood behind Luke whllile he was unpacking. He looked up presently and saw her. His face flushed violently, and in a half-whining, half ashamed tone he muttered: "Now, Betsy, you jest git out'n here faster'n ye come in, for I'm not goin' to stanr no fooli'n at all, now. These 'ere's my clothes and paid for out 'n my money, an' I'm the jedge of what I need. I ha'n't had any good duds for a long time, and I'm tired o' lookin' like a scarecrow made out hi a salt bag.

It's no great sight to see some shirts, an' coats, and pants, ain' col- lars, an' vests, anl sich like, is it?' Before this speech was finished Betsy had backed out of the room arnd closed the door. As she did so she let go a sigh that came back to Luke like a Parthian arrow; but it happened just then that he was holding up in front of himn a buff linen vest which kept the missile from his heart. He dressed himself with great care, and an hour later he slipped out of the house unseen, and took his way towards the rather preten- 13*  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC8053-00000076"/> 150  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. tious residence of Judge Barnett, the gables of which, a mile away, gleamed between rows of Lombardy poplars. The Judge was one ot those half cultivated men who, in every coun- try neighborhood, pass for prodigies of learn- ing and ability.' Hle was the autocrat of the county in political and social affairs-one of those men who really know a great deal, but who arrogate more. He got his title from having been County Commissioner when the court house was building. Some said he made money out of the transaction, but our story is silent there. %   \ It would have been an interesting study for a, philosopher to have watched Luke through- out the singular ramble he took that morning. It would have beeno such a manifest revelation of the state of the fellow's feelings. It would have minutely disclosed, and more eloquently than any verbal confession, the rise and fall, the ebb and flow, the alternating strength and weakness of his purpose, and the will behind it. Then, too, it would have let fall delightful hints of the unselfishness of his new and all- engrossing passion, and of the charnming sim- plicity and sincerity of his great, rugged nature at its inner core. At first he struck out boldly a direct line to Judge Barnett's residence, his   OIDEN.        151 face beaming with the light of settled happi-  ness, but as he neared the pleasant grounds burrounding tlme house he began to discover some trepidation. His gait wavered, the ex- pression of his face shifted with each step, and soon his course was indeterminate-a fitful sauntering from this place to that-a tricksy, unervel flight, like that of a lazy butterfly, if one may indulge the comnparison-a meander- ing in and out among the trees of a small wal- nut grove-a strolling here and there, now along the verge of a well set old orchard, now down the low hedge behind the garden, and anon leaning over the board fence that in- closed the Judge's ample barn and stable lot; he gazed wistfully, half comically, in the direc- tion of the upper windows of the farm house. It was one of those peculiarly yellow days of summer, when everything swims in a golden mist. The blue birds floated aimlessly about from stake to stake of the fences the wind, felt only in jerky puffs, blew no particular way, and as idly and as eccentrically as any- blue bird, and in full accord with the fitful will of the wind, Luke drifted through the sheen of summer all round Barnett Place. He lazed about, humming a tune, and, for a wondeirnot smoking-h4alf restless, half contented, looking  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC8053-00000077"/> 152  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. for something, scarcely expecting anything. When once a great rough man does get into a childish way, lie is a child of which ordinary children would be ashamed, and just then Luke, the big bashful fellow, was an instance strikingly in point. Occasionally he talked half aloud to himself. Once, while lounging on the orchard fence, gazing down between the long rows of russet and pippin trees, he said dreamily, "I must see her. I can't go back 'ithout seein' her." It so. chanced that just then a shower of blackbirds fell uponl the orchard, covering the trees and the ground, flying over and over each other, twittering and whistling as only blackbirds can. Their wings smote together with a tender rustling soundl like that of a spring wind in young foliage, or of a thousand lovers whispering together by moon- light. Luke watched them a long while, a doleful shade gathering in his filce. "The little things loves each other," he muttered; "everything loves something; an' jest dern my lights ef I don't love the gal, an1' '1m boun' to see her!". Seemingly nerved by sudden reso- lution, he climbed over the fence and started at a slashing pace across the orchard towards the house, scaring all the birds into an ecstasy   HOIDEN.       153 of flight, so that they dashed themselves against the foliage of the apple trees, making it rustle and sway as if blown on by a strong wind. He did not keep on, however. His resolution seemed to burn out about midway the orchard. He began to drift around again, his pace becoming slower and slower. His shoulders drooped forward as if burdened with a great load, his eyes turned restlessly from side to side. "I jest can't do it!" he murmured-"I jest can't do it, an' I mought as well go back!" There was a petulant ring to his voice-a nervous, worried tone, that had despair in it. Out of a June apple tree right over his head fell a sweet, silvery, half child's, half woman's voice, that thrilled hi::l through every fibre to the marrow of his bones. "What's the matter, Goosey?"What have you lost? What are you hunting for Want a good apple?" Luke looked up just in time to catch square- ly on 'his nose a fine, ripe June apple, and through a mist of juice and a sheeny curtain of leaves he saw the lovely' face he had come to look for. A thump on the nose from an apple, no matter if it is ripe and soft, is a little embarrassing, and it only makes it more so  .       .

But there are moments of supreme bliss when such a mishap passes unnoticed. Luke felt as if the blow had been the touch of a magician conjur- ing up a scene that held him rapt a1nd speech- less. 'O0, my! I O(idnt go to hit you! Please excuse me, sir--do. I thought you 'l catch it in your hands." , She came lightly down from the tree, de- scending like a bird, easily, gracefully, as if she had been born to climb. She murmured many apologies, but the genius of fun danced in her saucy, almost impertinent eyes, belying her regretful words. Luke looked dowin at her dazed and speechless. She, howevel was full of prattle--half chldish, half womanly, half serious, half bantering--her eyes upturnled to his, her voice a very bird's in melocy. In the more innocent sense of the word she- looked like her name, Hoiden. lNothing un- chaste or indelicate about her appearance; julst a sort of want of restraint; a freedom that amounted to-an utter lack of responsibility to the ordinary claims and dictates of propriety.

They climbed trees together, they scrambled for the same apple, they laughed, and shouted, and played till the horn at the farmhousescalled the field hands to dinner. They parted then, as children part, promising to meet again the next day. The girl's cllecks were rosy with exercise, so were Lulke's. How strange! Day after day that great, bearded, almnost middle-aged, uncouth farmer went and played slave to that chit of a girl, doing whatever ridiculous or childish thing she proposed,- caring I nothing, asking for nothing but to be with her, listen to her voice and feast -his eyes upon her beauty. ' He gladly bore everything she heaped upon him, an d to be called "Goosey" by her was to him inexpressibly charming. Betsy's womanly nature'was not to be tde- ceived.  She soon comprehended all; but she l dared not mention the subject to Lulke. He was in no mood to be opposed. So he went on-and Betsv sighed.   &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC8053-00000079"/> 156  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. The summer softened into autumnl. The maple leaves reddened. The long grass turned brown and lolled over. A softness and ten- derness lurked in the deep blue sky, and the air hadt a sharp-racy fragrallce from ripe fruit and grain. Meantime the railroad had been pushed with amazing rapidity nearly to com- pletion. Every day long construction trains went crashing across Lulke's farm. Passenger coaches were to be put on in a few days. Luke was the very picture of happiness. He seemed to grow younger every day.  His worldly prospects, too, were flattering. A station had been located on his land, around which a town had already begun to spring up. The vast value of Luke's timber, walnut and oak, was just beoginning to appear; ilndeed, immense wealth lay in his hands. But his happiness was of a deeper and purer sort than that gene- rated by simple pecuniary prosperity. Hoiden Pearl was in the focus of all his tloughts; her face lighted his dreams, her voice made the music that charmed hm into a wonder- land of bliss. He said little about ler, even to Betsy, but it needed no sharpness of sight to discover from his face what was going on in his heart. He had even forgotten his pipe. He had not smoked since that first day in the   HOIDEN.       157 orchard. He had straightened up and looked a span taller. The girl did not seem to dream of any tender attachment on Luke's part. In fact he gave her no cause for it. He fed on his love in- wardly and never thought of telling it. To be with her was enough. It satisfied all his wants. She was frank and free with him, but tyrannized over him-ordered him about like a servant, scolded him, flattered him, pouted at him, smiled on him, indeed kept him crazy with rapture all the time. Once only she be- came confidentially communicative. It was one day, sitting on an old mossy log in the Judge's woodland pasture, she told him the story of her past life. How thrillingly beutti- ful her face became as it sobered downiwith the history of early orphanage! Her father had died first; then her mother, who left ler four years old in the care of Mr. Pearl, her paternal uncle, with whom she had ever since been, going from place to place, as the calls of his nomadic profession made it necessary, from survey to survey, from this State to that, seeing all sorts of people, and receiving her education in small, detached parcels. The story was a sad, unsatisfactory one, breathing neglect, yet full of a certain kind of sprightli- "  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC8053-00000080"/> 158  A BOOKI OF HOOSIE MXOSAICS. ness, and touchlled here and there with the fascination of true romalce. It is hard to say when Lukle would have awakened from his tender trance to the stronl o reality of love. IEe was too contented for self- questioning, and no act or word of Hoidcl's invited himi to consider what he was doing or whither he was drifting. It was well for Luke and the girl, too, that it was a sparsely settled neighborhood, for evil tongues mightt lave made much of their con- stant companionship and childish bellavior. As for the Judge, after it was all over he admitted that he felt some qualms of con- science about allowing such unlimited intimacy to go on, but lie excused himself by saying that the girl, when colfined to the lhouse, was such an unnitigated nuisance that he was glad / some one to monopolize her company. 't Why," said he, in his peculiar way, " she ': set the whole house by the ears. She made more clatter and racket than a four-horse Penn- sylvania wagon coming down a rocky hill. She would go from garret to cellar like a. whirl- wind and twist things wrong side out as she wen--- she was a tart!" But at length, toward the middle of autumn the end came. Luke had business with some   HOIDEN.       159 hog-buyers in Cincinnati whither he was gone several days. Meantime the railroad was completed, and Mr. Pearl came to the Judge's early one morning and called for Hoiden. His business with lbis employers. was ended, and he had just finished an arrangement that had long been on foot to go to one of the South American States and take charge of a vast engineering scheme there. The girl was de lighted. Such a prospect of travel and ad- venture was enough to set one of her tem- perament wild with enthusiasm. She flew to packing her trunk, her face radiant with joy. Only an hour later Mr. Pearl and Hoiden stood at the new station on Lukes land, wait- ing- for the east-going train. Mr. Pearl hap- pened to think of a business message hewished to leave for Luke, so he went into the dept building and wrote it. When Hoiden saw the letter was for Luke she begged leave to put in a few words of postscript, and she had her way. The trail came and the man and girl were whirled --Wi- to New York, and thence they took ship for Suth Americ'a, never to return. Next day Luke came back, bringing with him a beautifull, carved mnahogany box moumted in silver. \ Betsy met him at the  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC8053-00000081"/> 160  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. door, and, woman-like, told the story of Hoiden's departure almost at the first breath. "' Gone all the way to South America," she added, after premising that she would never return. A peculiarly grim, grayish smile mantled the face of Luke. He swallowed a time or two before he could speak. "Come now, sis" (he always said 4' sis" when he felt somewhat at Betsy's mercy). "me now, sis, don't try to fool me. I'm goin' right over to see the gal now, an' I've got what'll tickle her awfully right here in this 'ere )box."  Out iln the yard the blue jays and wood- peckers were quarrelling over the late apples heaped up by the cider mill. The sky was clear, but the sunlight, coming through a smoky atmosDhere, was pale, like the smile of a sick man. The wind of autumn rlan steadily through the shrubby weedy lawn with a sigh that had in it the very essence of sadness. "I tell you, Luke, I'm not trying to fool you; they've gone clean to South America to stay .always," reiterated Betsy. Luke gazed for a moment steadily into his  sister's eyes, as if lcoking for'a sign. Slowly his stalwart body and muscular limbs relaxed R         ..   HOIDEN.       161 and collapsed. The box fell to the floor with a crash, where it burst, letting roll out great hoops of gold and starry rings and pins-a gold watch and chain, a beautiful gold pen and pencil case, and trinkets and gew-gaw things almost innumerable. They must have cost the full profits of his business trip. Luke staggered into a chair. Betsy just then happened to think of the letter that had been left for her brother. This she fetched and handed to him. It was the note of busi- ness from Mr. Pearl. There was a postscript in a different hand: ' Good-bye, Goosey! Hoidy Pearl." That was all. Luke is more morose and petulant than he used to be. He is decaying about apace with Rackenshack, and he smokes constantly. He is vastly wealthy and un- married. Betsy is quiet and kind. Up stairs in her chest is hidden the mahogany coffer full of golden testimonials of her brother's days of happiness and the one dark hour of his de- spair I "*         .  ,    \ , .  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC8053-00000082"/> J{HE PEDAGOGUE. HE was one of the farmer princes of Hoosier- dom, a man of more than average education, a fluent talker and ready with a stOry. Know- ing that I was looking up reminiscences of Hoosier life and specimens of Hoosier charac- ter, he volunteered one evelling to give me the following, vouching for the truth of it. Here, it is, as I s' short-handedl" it from his own lips. I omit quotation marks. The study of one's past life is not unlike the study of geology. If the presence of the re- mains of extinct species of animals and vege- tables in the ancient rocks calls up in one's mind a host of speculative thoughts touching the progress of creation, so, as we cut with the pick of retrospection through the strata of bygone days, do the remains of departed things, constantly turning up, put one into his studying cap to puzzle over specimens fully as curious and interesting in their way as the cephtalaspis.   THE PEDAGOGUE.      163 The first stratum of my intellectual forma- tion contains most conspicuously the remains of dog-eared spelling books, a score or more of them by different names, among which the Elementary of Webster is the best preserved and most clearly defined. It was finding an old, yellow, badly thumbed and dirt soiled copy of Webster's spelling book in the bottom of an old chest of odds and ends, on the fly- leaf of which book was written "T. Blodgett," that lately brightened my memory of the things I am about to tell you. The old time pedagogue is a thing of the past-pars temnporis acti is the Latin of it, may be, but I'm not sure-I'm rusty in the Latin now. When I quit school I could read it a good deal. But of the pedagogue. The twenty years since he ceased to flourish seem, on re- flection, like an age--an ceon, as the Greeks would say. I never did know much Greek. I got mnost of my education from pedagogues of the old sort.' They kept pouring it on to me till it soaked in. That's the way I got it. I have had corns and bunions on my back for not being sufficiently porous to absorb the multiplication table rapidly enough to suit the whim of one of those learned tyrants. But the pedagogue became extinct and passed into the  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC8053-00000083"/> 164  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. fossil state some twenty years ago, when free schools took good hold. He scampered away when he heard the whistle of the steam -engine along iron highways and the cry of small boys on the streets of the towns hawking the daily papers. He could live nowliere within the pale of innovation. He was' born anl exemplar of rigidity. The very name of reform was lhate- ful to blim. We older fellows remenlber him well, but to the younger fry he is not even a fossil, lie is a imyth. Of course pedagogues differed slightly in the matter of particular disposition and real character, but in a general way they had a close family resemblance. I purpose to write of one Blodgett--T. Blod- gett, as it was written in the fly-leaf of NVeb- sters Elementary-and he was an extraordi- nary specimen of the genus pedagogue. But before I introduce him, let me, by way of pre- face and prelude, give you a view of the salients of the history of the days when lpole- ribbed school houses--log cabin scllool houses -fiourished, with each a pedagogue for su- preme, "unquestioned and unquestionable" despot. In those fine days boys from five to fifteen years of age wore tow linen pants held up by suspenders (often made of tow strings), and   THE PEDAGOGUE.      165' lbaving at each side pockets that reached down to about the wearer's knees. These pockets held as much as a- moderate sized bushel basket will now. The girls, big and little, wore mere tow linen slips, that hung loose from the shoulders. Democracy, pure and u1n- defiled, flourished' like a green buckeye tree. Society was in about the same condition as a boy is when his voice is changing. You know when a boy's voice is changing if you hear him in another room getting his lesson by say- ing it over aloud, you think there's about four- teen girls, two old men, antd a dog barking in the room. Society was much the same. The elements of everything were in it, but not de- veloped and separated yet. Women rode be- hind their husbands on the same horse, occa- sionally reaching round in the man's lap to feel if the baby was properly fixed. Some- times the girls rode to singiing school behind their sweethearts. At such times the lhorses always kicked ip, and, of course, the girls had to hold on. The boys liked the holding on part. Young men went courting always on Saturday night. The girls wouldn't suffer any hugging before eleven o'clock--unless the old folk were remarkably early to-bed. Candles were scarce in those days, so that billing and  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC8053-00000084"/> 16G  A BOOK OF HOOSIER {MOSAICS. cooing was done by very done beri fire-light. O, le bon temps! I've forgot whether that's Latin or French. The pedagogue was the intellectual and moral centre of the neighborhood. He was of higher authority, evenl in the law than the Justice of the Peace. He was consulted on all subjects, and as a rule, his decisions were final, and went upon the peoples record as law. His jurisdiction was unlimited, as to sub- ject matter or amount, and, as to the lerson, was unquestioned. Of course his territory \ was bounded by the circumstances of each particular case. I just now recollect quite a number of peda- gogues who in turn ruled me in my- -yothful days. Of one of them I never think without feeling a strange sadness steal over me. He was a young fellow whom to k1now was to love; pale, delicate, tender-hearted. He taught us two terms and we all thoughthim the best teacher in the world. Hle was so kind to us, so gentle and mild-voiced, so prone to pat Uis on our heads and encourage us. Some of the old people found fault with hm because, as they alleged, he did not whip us enough, but we saw no force in the objection. Well, he took a cough and began to fail. He dismissed   THE PEDAGOGUE.      167 us one fine May evening and we saw him no more alive. We all followed him, in a solemn line, to his grave, and 'for a long time there- after we never spoke of him except in-a low, sad whisper. As for me, till long, afterwards, the hushed wonder of his wliite face haunted my dreams. I have now in my possession a little bead money-purse he gave me. Blodgett came next, and here my story properly begins. B1lodgett-who, having once seen him, could ever forget Blodgett? Not I. He was too marked a man to ever wholly fade from nlemory. He was, as I hlave said, a per- fect type of his kind, and his kind was such as should not be sneered at. He was one of the humble lioneers of American letters. He was a character of which our, national history must talke account. He was one of the vital forces of our earlier national growth. He was in love with learning. He considered the matter of imparting knowledge a mere question of effort, in which the physical element prepon- derated. If lhe -couldn't talk or read it into one lhe took a stick and mxauled it into him. This maulin' method, though somewhat dis- tasteful to the subject, always had a charming result-red eyes, a few blubbers and a good lesson. The itechnical name of this method  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC8053-00000085"/> 168  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. was "Warming the Jacket."' It- always seemecl to me that the peewee birds sang very doleful- ly after I had had my jacket warmed. I recol- lect my floggings at school with so inuch aversion that, I do think, if a teacher should whale one of my little ruddy-faced boys, I'd spread his (the teacher's) nose over hs face as thin as a rabbit skin! I'd run both his eyes into one and cllew his ears off close to his head, sir! Forgive my earnlestness, but I can't stand floggitg in schools. It's -rutal. From the first day that Blodgett came cir- culating his school "articles" among us, we took to him by common consent as a wonder- fiully learned man. I think his strong, wise looking face, and reserved, pompous manners, had much to do with making this impression. We believed in him fully, and for a long time gave himl unfaltering loyalty. As for me, I never have -wholly -withdrawn my allegiance. I look back, even now, and admire him. I sigh, thinking of the mlerry days when he flourished. I solemnly avow my faith in prog- ress. I know the world advances every day, still I doubt if men and wome n are more worthy now than they were in the time of the ledia- gogues. I don't know but what, after all, I am somewhat of a fogy.

Whenever one of your silk- winged swallows skims past me and whispers progress, I cannot help thinking of Heyne, Jean Paul and--Blodgett. Somehow genius and poverty are great cronies. It used to be more so than it is now.  Blodgett was a gelnius, and, consequently, poor. He was vir- tuous, and, of course, happy  He was a Dem- ocrat and a Hard Shell Baptist, and he might never have swerved froul the path of rectitude, even to the extent of a hair's breadth, if it had not beel for the coming of a not over scrupu- lous rival into the neighlboring village. But I must not hastens. A  little more and I would have blurted out the whole nlub of my story. Bear with me. I have nothing of the'"light- ning calculator " in me. I must take my time. It has been agreed that bliography must include somewhat of physical portraiture. "What sort of looking man was Blodgett?" I will tell you as nearly as I can, but bear in mind it is a long time since I saw him, and, in 15  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC8053-00000086"/> 170  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. the meanw hile, the world has been so washed, and combed, and trimmed, and pearl pow- dered, that one can scarcely be sure he recol- lects things rightly. The seedy dandy who teaches the free schools of to-day, is, no doubt, all right as things go; but then the way they go-that's it! As for finding some one of these, dapper, umbrella-lugging, greell-sDec- tacled, cadaverous teachers to compare with our burly Blodgett, the thing is preposterous. Our pedagogue, when he first came among us, was, as nearly as I can judge, about forty, and a bachelor, tall, raw-boued, leali-faced, and muscular--a man of many- words, and big ones, but not over prone to seek audience of the world. To me, a boy of twelve, he ap- peared somewhat awful, especially when ply- ing the beech rod for the benefit of a future man, 'and I do still thinkli that something harder than mere sternness slept or woke in and around the lines of his strong, fiat jaws-- that something sharper than acid shrewdness lurked in his light gray eyes, and that surely a more powerful expression than ordinary brute obstinacy lingered about his firm mouth and smoothly shaven chin. Blodgett had a mighty body and a mighty will, joined with a self-appreciation only bound- \   THE PEDAGOGUE.      171 ed by his power to generate it. This, added to the deep deference with which he was ap-, proached by everybody, made him not a little arrogant and despotic-though, doubtless, he was less so thhan most men, under like circum- stances, would have been. His years sat lightly on him. His step was youthful though slouching, his raven hair was bright and wavy, his skin had the tinge of vigorous health, and in truth he was not far from handsome. His voice was nasal, but pleasantly so. I canlnot hope to give you more than a faint idea of the absolute power vested in Blodgett by the men, women and clhildren of the school vicinage; suffice it to say that his view was a sine qua, non to every neighborhood opinion, his words the basis of neighborlood action inL all matters of public interest. If he pronounced the parson's last sermon a failure, at once the entire church agreed in condemning it, not only as a fililure but a consummate blunder. If he hinted that a certain new comer inm-i pressed him unftavorably, the nincompoop was summarily kicked out of society. In fact, in the pithy phraseology of these latter days, "it was dangerous to be safe " about where he lived. Thus, for a long time, Blodgett ruled with  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC8053-00000087"/> 172  A BOOK Of HOOSIER MOSAICS. an iron hand his little world, with no one to dream of disputing his right or of doulting his capacity, till at length fate let fall a bit of romance into the strong but placid stream of lis life, and tinged it all with rose color. He wrote some poetry, but it is obsolete-that is, it is not now in existence. While this streak of romance lasted helooked, for all the world, like a gilt-edged mathematical problem drawn -4n rawhide. It was a great event in our neighborhood when Miss Grace Holland, a yellow-haired, blue-eyed, very handsome and well educated young lady from Louisville, Kentucky, came to spend the sulmmer with Parson Holland, our preacher, and the young woman's uncle. Ken- tucky girls are all sweet. My wife was a Ken- tucky girl. All the young men fell in love with Miss Holland right away, but it was of no use to them. Blodgett, in the language of your fast youngsters, "shied his castor into the ring," and what was there left for the others but to stand by and see the glory of the pedagogue during the season of his woo- ing? It would have doneeyour eyes good to see the pedagogue "slick himself up" each Saturday evening preparatory to visiting the parson's. He went into the details of the   THE PEDAGOGUE.      173 toilette with an enthusiasm worthy a better result. Ordinarily he was ostentatiously pious and grave, but now his nature began to slip its bark and disclose an inner rind of real mirthfulness, which made him quite pleasant company for Miss Holland, who, though a mere girl, was sensible and old enough to en- joy the many marked peculiarities of the peda- gogue. On Blodgett's side it was love-just "the blindest, craziest kind of love, at first sight. As to Miss Holland, I cannot say. One never can precisely sayas to a woman; guessing at a woman's feelings, in matters of love, is a little like wondebng which makes the music, a boy's mouth or the jewsharp- a doubtful affair. Great events never come singly. When it rains it pours. If you have seen a bear, every stump is a bear. A few days after the advent of Miss Holland came a pop-eyed, nervous, witty little fellow with a hand press, and start- ed a weekly, paper in our village. A news- paper in town! It was startling. Blodgett from the first seemed not to relish the innovation, but publio sentimenlt hadl set in too strongly in its favor for him to jeopardize his reputation by any serious denunciations. A real live paper in our midst was no small 15  -  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC8053-00000088"/> 174  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. matter. Everybody subscribed, and so did Blodgett. It did, formnerly, require a-little brains to run a nlewspaper, and ifn those days an editor was looked upon as nearly or quite as learned and intelligent as a pedagogue; but everybody, however ignorant himself; could not fail to see that one represented progress, the other con- servatism, and formerly most persons were Ultra-Conservatives. This, of course, gave the pedagogue a considerable advantage. Of course Blodgett and the editor soon be- came acquainted. The latter, a dapper Yankee, full of " get-up-and-snap,"' and alert to make way for his paper, measured the pedagogue at a glance seeing at once that a big bulk of strong sense and a will like iron were en- wrapped in the stalwart Hoosier's brain. One of t6vo things must be done. Blodgett must be vanquished or his influence sectred. He must be prevailed onl to endorse the Star (the new paper), or the Star must attack and destroy him at once. Meantime the pedagogue grimly waited for an opportunity to demolish the editor. The big loosier had no thought of compromise or currying .favor. He would sacrifice the little sleek, stuck-up, big-headed, pop-eyed, RIoman- s  .   THE PEDAGOGUE.      175 nosed Yankee between his thumb nails as he would a flea. Bloldgett was a predestinarian of the old school, and was firmly imbedded in the belief that from all eternity it had been fore-ordained that he was to. attend to just such fellows as the editor. Still, the little lady from Louisville took up so much of his time, and so distracted his mind, that no well laid plan of attack could be matured by the pedagogue. But when nations wish to fight it is easy to find a pretext for war. So witlh individuals. So with the editor and Blodgett. They soon came to open hostilities and raised the black flag. What an uproar it did make in the county! This war seemed to come aboutt quite natu- rally. It had its beginning in a debating society, where Blo(dgett and the editor were leading antagonists. The question debated was, -' Which has done molre for the cause of humatn liberty, Napoleon or Wellington?. " Two village menand two countrymen were the jury to decide which side offered the best argument. The jury was out all night and finally returned a split verdict, two of them standing for Blodgett and two for the editor. Of course it was. town against country-the villagers for: the editor, the country folk for the pedagogue.  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC8053-00000089"/> 176  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. "Huzza for the little editor " cried the town people. "'Rah for Blodgett " bawled the lusty country folk. The matter quickly came to blows at certain parts of the room. Jim Dowder caught Phil Gates by the hair and snatched him over two seats. Sarah Jale Beaver hit Martha Aln Randall in the mouth with a reticule full of hazel nuts. Farmer Heath choked store- keeper Jones till his face was as blue as moderate-like indigo. Old Mrs. Baber pulled off Granny Logan's wig and threw it at 'Squire Hank. But Pete Develin wound the thing up with a most disgraceful feat. He seized a bucket half full of water and deliberately poured it right on top of the editor's head. This was the beginning of trouble and fun. Some lawsuits grew out of it and some hard fisticuffs. All the country-folk sided with Blodgett-the townls-fblk with the editor. The Star began to get dim, but the editor, shrewd dog, when he saw how things were turning, at once took up the question of Na- poleon vs. Wellington in his journal, kindly and condescendingly offering his columns to Blodgett for the discussion. The pedagogue foolishy accepted the chal-   TIE PEDAGOGUE. '    1" / lenge, and thus laid the stones upon which he was to fall. So the antagonists sharpened their goose quills and went at it. In sporting circles the proverb runs: never bet on a man's own trick. Blodgett ought to have known better than to go to the editors own ground to fight. I have always suspected that Miss Holland did much to shear our Samson of his strength. She certainly did, wittingly or unwittingly, occupy too much of his time and thought. Poor fellow! he would have given his life for her. He often looked at her, with his head turned a little one side, sadly, thoughtfully, as 1 have seen a terrier look at a rat hole, as though he half expected disappointment. The battle in the Star began in very earnest. It was a harvest for the shrewd journalist. Everybody took the Star while the discussion was going on. Everybody took sides, every- body got mad, and almost everybody fought more or less.' Even Parson Holland and the village preacher had high words and ceased to recognize each other. As for the young lady from Louisville, she had little to say about the discussion, though Blodgett always read to her each one of his articles first in MS. and then in the Star after it was printed.  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC8053-00000090"/> 178  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. Well, finally, in ,the very height of the war of words, the editor, in one of his articles, in- dulged in Latin. As you are aware, when an editor gets right down to pan-rock Latin, it's a sure sign he's after somebody. This instance was no exception to the general rule. He was baiting for the pedagogue. The pedagogue swallowed hook and all. "  Nil de mortuis nisi bonum," said the editgr, "is my motto, which may be freely translated: "If you can't say something good of the dead, keep your tarnal mouth shut about them!" Blodgett started as he read this, and for a full minute thereafter gazed steadily and il- quiringly on vacancy. At length his great bony right hand opened slowly, then quickly shut like a vice. "I have him! I have him!" he muttered ill a murderous tone, "I'll crush him to iilp l- pable dust! He forthwith went for a' small Lati lexicon and began busily searching its pages. It was Saturday evening, and so busily did he labor at what was on his mind, he came near forgetting his regular weekly visit to Miss Holland. He did not forget it, however. He went; without pointing out to her the exact spot so vulnerable to his logical arrows, he told her in   THE PEDAGOGUE.      179 a confidential and confident way that his next letter would certainly make an end of the editor. He told her that, at last, he had the shallow puppy where he could expose him thoroughly. Of course Miss Holland was curious to know more, but, with a grim smile, Blodgett shook his head, saying that to insure ttter victory he must keep his own counsel. The next day, though the Sabbath, was spent by the pedagogue writing his crusher for the Star. He wrote it and re-wrote it, over and over again. He almost ruined a Latin grammar and the afore-mentioned lexi- con. He worked till far in the night, revising aud elaborating. His gray eyes burned like live coals-his jaws were set for victory. That week was one of intense excitement all over the county, for somehow it had come  generally to be understood that the peda- gogue's forthcoming essay was to completely defeat and disgrace the editor. Work, for the time, was' mostly suspended. The school children did about as they pleased, so that they were careful not to break rudely in upon Blodgett's meditations.  On the day of its issue the Star was in great demand. For several hours ;-the office was crowded witlh eager subscribers, hungry for a gry  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC8053-00000091"/> 180  A BOOK OF HOOSIER IMOSAICS. copy. The 'Squire and two constables had some trouble to keep down a genuine riot. The following, is an exact copy of Blodgett's great essay: MR. EDITOR-SIR: This, for two reasons, is my last article for your journal. Firstly: My time and the exigencies of my profession will not permit me to further pursue a discussion which, on your part, has degenerated into the merest twaddle. Secondly: It only needs, at my hands, an exposition of the false and fraud- ulent claims you make to classical attainments, to entirely annihilate your unsubstantial and wholly undeserved popularity in this commu- nity, and to send you back to peddling your bass wood hams and maple nutmegs. In order to put on a false show of erudition, you lug into your last article a familiar Latin sentence. iow, sir, if you had sensibly foregone any at- tempt at translation, you might, possibly, have made some one think you knew a shade more than a horse; but "whom the gods would de-" stroy they first make mad." You say, "'De mortuis nil nisi bonumz " miay be freely translated, "If you can't say something good of the dead, keep your tarnal mouth shut about them!" Shades of Horace and Prax- iteles! What would Pindar or Caesar say? But   THE PEDAGOGUE.      181 I will not jest at the expense of sound scholar- ship. In conclusion, I simply sublmit the fol- lowing literal translation of the Latin sentence in question: "De-of, mortuis--the dead, nil- nothing, nzisi-but, bonum--goods," so that the whole quotation may be rendered as follows- ' Nothing (is left) of the dead but (their) goods." This is strictly according to the dic- tionary. Here, so far as I am concerned, this discussion ends.  Your ob't serv't, T. BLODGETT. The country flared into flames of triumph. Blodgett's friends stormed the village and "bully-ragged" everybody who had stood out for the editor. The little Yankee, however, did not appear in the least disconcerted. His clear, blue, pop-eyes really seemed twinkling with half suppressed joy. Blodgett put a copy of the Star into his pocket and stalked proudly, victoriously, out of town. After supper he dressed himself with scru- pulous care and went over to see Miss Holland. ^ Rumor said they were engaged to be married, and I believe they were. On this particular evening the young lady was enchantingly pretty, dressed in white muslin and blue ribbons, her bright yellow hair flowing full and free down upon her 16  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC8053-00000092"/> 182  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. plump shoulders, her face radiant with health and high spirits. She met the pedagogue at the' door with more than usual warmth of welcome. He kissed her hand. All that he said to her that evening will never be known. It is recorded, however, that, when he had fin- ished reading his essay to her, she got up and took from her travelling trunk a "Book of Foreign Phrases," and examined it attentively for a time, after which she was somewhat un- easy and reticent. Blodgett observed this, but he was too dignified to ask an explanation. The " last day" of Blodgett's school was at hand. The " exhibition7 came off on Satur- day. Everybody went early. The pedagogue was in his glory. He did not know the end was so near. A little occurrence, toward even- ing, however, seemed to foreshadow it. Blodgett called upon the stage a bright eyed, ruddy faced lad, his favorite pupil, to translate Latin phrases. The boy, in his Sun- day best, and sleekly combed, came forth and bowed to the audience, his eyes luminous with vivacity. The little fellow was evidently pre- cocious-a rapid if not a very accurate thinker -one of those children who always have an answer ready, right or wrong. After several preliminary questions, very   THE PEDAGOGUE.     183 promptly and satisfactorily disposed of, Blod- gett said: "Now, sir, translate Monstrunm horrendumn informe ingens." Quick as lightning the child replied: ' The horrid monster informed the Indians i" Fury! The face of the pedagogue grew livid. He stretched forth his hand and took the boy by the back of the ned. The curtain fell, but the audience could not help hearing what a flogging the boy got. It was terrible. Even while this was going on a rumor rip- pled round the outskirts of the audience-for you must know that the " exhibition" was held under a bush arbor erected in front of the school house door-a rumor, I say, rippled round the outer fringe of the audience. Some one had arrived from the village and copies of the Star were being freely distributed. Looks of blank amazement flashed into people's faces. The name of the editor and that of Prof: W-- of Wabash College, began to fly in sharp whis- pers from mouth to mouth. The crowd reeled and swayed. Men began to tall aloud. Finally everybody got on his feet and confusion and hubbub reigned supreme. The exhibition was broken up. Blodgett came out of the school house upon the stage when- he heard the noise.  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC8053-00000093"/> 184   A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. He gazed around. Some one thrust a copy of the, Star into his hand. * Poor Blodgett I We may all fall. The crowd resolved itself into an indignation Ileet- ing then and there, at which the followingc ex- tract from the Star was read, followed by reso- lutions dismissing and disgracing Blodgett: "(The following letter is rich reading for those who have so long sworn by T. Blodgett. We offer no comment: ' EDITOR OF THE STAR -DEAR SIR : In an- swer to your letter requesting me to decides be- tween yourself and Mr. Blodgett as to the correct English rendering of the Latin sen- tence "De mortuis nil nisi bonumy allow me to say that your free translation is a good one, if not very literal or elegant.

We were under a cherry tree by a private hedge, Presently -Miss Holland came out and began, girl-like, to pluck and eat the half ripe cherries. The wind rustled her white dress and lifted the gold floss of her wonderful hair. The birds chattered and sang all round us; the white clouds lingered overhead like puffs of steam vanishing against the splendid bhle of the sky. The fragrance of leaf and fruit and bloom was heavy on the air. The girl in white, the quiet glory of the day, the murmur of the unsteady wind stream flowing among the dark leaves of the orchard and hedge, the charm of the tem- perature, and over all, the delicious sound of running water from  the brook hard by, all 16J*  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC8053-00000094"/> 186  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAIa harmonized, and in a tender childish mood I quit the game and lolled at full length on the ground, watching the fascinating face of the young lady as she drifted about the pleasant places of the orchard. Suddenly I saw her fix her eyes in a surprised way in a certain direc- tion. I looked to see what had startled her, and there, half leaning over the hedge, stood Blodgett. His face was ghastly in its pallor, and deep furrows ran down his jaws. His gray eyes had in them a look of longing blended with a sort of stern despair. It was only for a moment that his powerful frame toppled above-the hedge, but he is indelibly pictured in my memory justas he then appeared. ' Good-bye, Miss Holland, good-bye." How dismally hollow his voice sounded! Ah! it was pitiful. I neither saw nor heard of him after that. Years have passed since then. Blodgett is, likely, in his grave, but I never think of him without a sigh. Yesterday I was il the old neighborhood, and, to my surprise, learned that the old log school house was still standing. So I set out alone to visit it. I found it rotten and shaky, serv- ing as a sort of barn in which a farmer stows his oats, straw and corn fodder. The genius   THE PEDAGOGUE.      187 of learning has long since flown to finer quar- ters. The great old chimney had been torn down or had fallen, the broadl boards of the roof, held on by weight poles, were deeply cov- ered with moss and mould, and over the whole edifice hung a gloom-a mist of decay. I leaned upon a worm fence hard by and gazed through the long vacant side window, underneath which our writing shelf used to be, sorrowfully dallying with memory; not alto- gether sorrowfully either, for the glad faces of children that used to romp with me on the old play ground floated across my memory, clothed in the charming haze of distance, and encircled by the halo of tender affections. The wind sang as of old, and the bird songs had not changed a jot. Slowly my whole being crept back to the past. The wonders of our prog- ress were all forgotten. -And then ftro within the old school room came a well re- membered voice, with a certain nasal twaig, repeating slowly and sternly the words: "Arma virumque cano ;" then there came a chime of silver tones-- School is out!-School is out!"And I started, to find that I was all alone by the rotting but blessed old throne and palace of the pedagogue. , .  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC8053-00000095"/> -tN tDY OF THE 3OD IT was as pretty a country cottage as is to be found, even now, in all the Wabash Valley, situatedt on a prominent blufft overlooking the broad stretches 'of bottom land, and giving a fine view of the wide winding river. The win- dows and doors of this cottage were draped in vines, among which the morning glory and the honeysuckle were the most luxuriant; while on each side of the gravelled walk, that led from the front portico to the dooryard gate, grew clusters of pinks, sweet-williams and larkspurs. The house was painted white, and had green window shutters-old fashioned, to be sure, but cosy, homelike and tasty wihal. Everything pertaining to and surrounding the place had an air of methodical neatness, that betokened great care and scrupulous order on the part of the inmates. About the hour of six on a Monday morn- ing, in the month of May, a fine, hearty, intel- ligent looking lad of twelve years walked   AN IDY OF THE ROD.     189 slowly up the path which led from the old orchard to the house. He was dressed in loose trowsers of bottle green jeans, a jacket of the same, heavy boots and a well worn wool hat. The boy's shoulders stooped a little, and a slight hump discovered itself at the upper portion of his back. His face was strikingly handsome, being fair, bright, lealthful, and marked with signs of great precocity of intel- lect, albeit it wore just now an indescribable, faintly visible shade, as of innocent perplexity, or, possibly, grief. His mind was evidently not at ease, but the varying shadows that chased each other across the mild depths of his clear, vivacious eyes would have stumped a physiognomist. Between a laugh and a cry,. but more like a cry; between defiance and utter shame, but more like the latter; his. cheeks and lips took on every shade of pallor and of flush. He shrugged his shoulders as. he moved along, and cast rapid glances in every direction, as if afraid of being seen.. "Whippoo-tee, tippoo-tee-tee-e!" sang a great cardinal red bird in the apple tree over his head. He flung a stone at the bird with terri- ble energy, but missed it. The mistress of the cottage was at this time, in the kitchen preparing for the week's washing,  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC8053-00000096"/> 190  A BOOK OF HOOSIER MOSAICS. for do not all good Hoosier housewives wash on Monday1 She was a middle aged, stoutly built, healthy matron, sandy haired, slightly freckled, blue eyed and quick in her move- ments. Usually smiling and happy, it was painful to see how she struggled now to mas- ter the emotions of great grief and sadness that constantly arose in her bosom, like spec- tres that would not be driven away. A bright eyed, golden haired lass of sixteen was in the breakfast room washing the dishes and singing occasional snatches from a mourn- ful ditty. It was sad, indeed, to see a cloud of sorrow on a face so fresh and sweet. Mr. Coulter, the head of the family, and owner of the cottage and its lands, stood near the centre of the sitting room with his hands crossed behind him, gazing fixedly and sadly on the picture of a sweet child holding a white kitten in its lap, which picture hung on the wall over against the broad fire-place. A look of sorrow betrayed itself even in the dark, stern visage of the man. He drew down his shaggy eyebrows and occasionally pulled his grizzled moustache into his mouth and chewed it fiercely. Evidently he was chafing under his grief. The cottage windows were wide open, as is ^         '       /   AN IDY OF THE ROD.    19 the western custom in fine weather, and the fragrance of spice wood and sassafras floated in on the flood tide of pleasant air, while from the big old locust tree down by the fence fell the twittering prelude to a finch's song. A green line of willows and a thin, pendulous stratum of fog marked the way of the river, c plainly visible from the west window, and through the white haze flocks of teal and wood ducks cut swiftly in their downward flight to the water. A golden flicker sang and hammered on the gate-post the while he eyed a sparrow-hawk that wheeled and screamed high, over head. The dew was like little mir- rors in the grass. The lad entered the kitchen and said to his mother, in a voice full of tenderness, though barely audible: "Mammy, where's pap '? "In the front room, Billy," replied the ma- tron solemnly, quaveringly. Passing into thebreakfast room, Billy looked at his sister and a flash of sympathetic sorrow played back and forth from the eyes of one to those of the other; then he went straight into the sitting room and handed something to Mr. Coulter. It was a moment of silence and sus- pense.

The man looked down at his boy sadly, sor- rowfully, regretfully. He drew his face into a stern frown. The lad looked up into his father's eyes timidly, ruefully, strangely. It was a liv- ing tableau no artist could reproduce. It was the moment before a crisis. "Billy," said the father gravely, Htook your mother and sister to church yesterday."' "' Yes, sir," said Billy. "And left you to see to things," continued the man. "Yes, sir," replied the boy, gazing through the window at the flicker as it hitched down the gate-post and finally dropped into the grass with a shrill chirp. "And you didn't water them pigs!" "O-o-o! Oh, sir! Geeroody! O me! ouch! lawsy! lawsy! mercy me!" The slender scion of an apple tree, in the hand of Mr. Coulter, rose and fell, cutting the air like a rapier, and up from the jacket of the lad, like-incense from an altar, rose a cloud of dust mingled with the nap of jeans. Down in the young clover of the meadow the larks and sparrows sang cheerily; the gnats and flies danced up and down in the sunshine, the fresh   AN IDY OF THE ROD.    193 soft young leaves of the vines rustled like satin, and all was merry indeed! Billy's eyes were turned upward to the face of his father in appealing agony; but still the switch, with a sharp hiss, cut the air, falling steadily and mercilessly on his shoulders. All along the green banks of the river the willows shook their shining fingers at the lift- ing fog, and the voices of children going by to the distant school smote the sweet May wind. "Whippee! Whippee-tippee-tee!" sang the cardinal bird. "O pap! ouch! O-o-o! I'll not forget to water the pigs no more!" "S'pect you won't, neither!" said the Iman. The wind, by a sudden puff, lifted into the room a shower of white bloom petals from a sweet apple tree, letting them fall gracefully upon the patchwork carpet, the while a plough- man whistled plaintively in a distant field. "Crackee! O pap! ouch! O-o-o! You're a killin' me! "Shet your mouth 'r I'll split ye to the back- bone in a second! Show ye how to rug off fishin' with Ed Jones and neglect them pigs!

He would have swapped hides with the very pigs he had forgot to water. "O, land! O, me! Geeroody me!" yelled the lad. ' Them poor pigs!" rejoined the father. Still the dust rose and danced in the level jet of sunlight that fell athwart the room from the east window, and the hens out at the barn cackled and sang for joy over new laid eggs stowed away in cosy places. At one time during the falling of the rod the girl quit washing the dishes, and thrusting her head into the kitchen said, in a subdued tone :. "My land!

The switch actually screamed through the air. Billy danced and bawled and made all manner of serio-comic faces and con- tortions. t' Now go, sire" cried the man, finally tossing the frizzled stump of the switch out through the window.
