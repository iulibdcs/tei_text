They purport to be copies from memory, of conversations between more or less distinguished ghosts, of various climes and eras, as held at the residce of their hospitable host, and his ever-beloved and lamented friend, Whimsiculo the Elder.  The editor was never fortunate enough to be present at any of these inter- views, though he has frequently heard the old   &#xD;<pb n="xii-13" xml:id="VAC8093-00000006"/> Xii      INTRODUCTION. gentleman allude to them, and at times, with considerable warmth of manner; nor was he aware of the existence of any]  memorials of them, till recently lighting on the aforesaid MSS., while in the discharge of his arduous executo- rial duties. Delicacy will not allow him to com- ment upon the qualities, either of the speak- ers, or their themes. Of the substantial accu- racy of the reports of their interlocutions, how- ever, the well-known conscientiousness and sin- gular love of truth, of the exemplary defunct, are a sufficient guaranty. It will be seen that, at first, he has but little to say himself, save in the way of answer to the questions of his spiritual guests, though becoming more self-pos- sessed and chatty afterwards, on better acquaint- ance. With these few words of elucidation, the editor respectfully takes his leave.   ALCIBIADES-SHERIDAN. A Alc. I am delighted to meet you, my dear friend, under this hospitable roof. But how is it that we have never run against each other before Kindred spirits thatwe are, is it possible that our ghostly palms now come together in friendly collision for the first time, in our own native planet, and in this gay, thriving town of Gotham . Sher. So it seems, my dear boy, so it seems. Ale. I have had the pleasure, however, of seeing you before; aye, and of hearing you, upon two me- morable occasions. Sher. Indeed! what were they? AIk. Well, the last was quite recently; you were at the time addressing a large and enthusiastic meet- ing of residents, of the star Artemisia, on the great ff An..  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8093-00000007"/> "     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. subject of Homestead Exemption. I need not say that I was delighted; no one among the fifty thou- sand listeners more so, I assure you. I ought to be a pretty good judge of speaking, too, for we men of Athens, you know, were no fools at that business; to say nothing of the vast amount of popular ora- tory I have heard all over the universe, since then. You surely remember the circumstance. -Sher. Oh yes, I remember making a few remarks on the subject you speak of, to the good people of that luminary, and that they were well received. Poor things, it was high time that they should be stirred up on that point. Their financial affairs have been in a frightful way, for a great while. In- deed I do not know that I ever stumbled on a planet that was more crowded with insolvents. I speak not of your reckless, unprincipled contractors of obligations, but innocent, exemplary, high-minded insolvents. Ah! dear, I am afraid they will never again know, there, those choicest blessings of exist- ence, a sound currency and cash payments! Ex- cuse me, my friend, but when I get on this theme, I grow warm in spite of myself. May I ask, what was the other occasion, to which you have so kindly referred  . Ale. The other "was much longer ago, though it lives very distinctly in my memory. You were a   -+         SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      15 mortal at the time, and were standing at the corner of the street, with your friends, Kemble and Faw- cett, looking at the flames, as they danced and frol- icked about that universe-renowned temple of the Muses, Old Drury. I happened to be passing at the very moment, when you remarked, with great earnestness and many gestures, "Gentlemen, one thing alone sustains me in this terrible crisis, and that is the conviction that I have never been guilty of an unjust action. Principle, gentlemen, princi- ple"-here, I remember, you paused, and thumping your breast with manly energy, repeated the glori- ous sentiment several times, in the same glowing language. Never, never, my dear friend, in the whole course of my spiritual career, was I more profoundly impressed ; and had it at all accorded with my spiritual arrangements for the evening, I should have remained, and insisted upon an imme- diate introduction; but-- Sher. Stop, stop, my friend. You are touching now upon a tender chord, Let us change the sub- ject. Ale. I really ask pardon for--- Sher. Not at all, not at all. But, my dear Alci- blades, if I may be so bold, where were you, at the time of receiving our noble host's polite invitation? Alc. Well, your question might be an embarrass-  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8093-00000008"/> 16      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. ing one, to some spirits ; however easy it may be for such an exemplary, and notorious home-body of a ghost as myself, to answer. Know, then, my financial friend, that the invitation in question found me com- fortably seated in my lodgings in the north star, in gown and slippers, and toasting my spiritual toes, while deep in the perusal of the seventy-fifth edition of a, most (harming little work, entitled "Aunt Susan's Boudoir ;" wherein, under the guise of a sprightly romance, some most profound- social and moral truths are thoroughly developed, and brought home to the enthralled reader; a work that has already created a most intense sensation throughout Ursa Major, and which, if I am not greatly mistaken, is destined to have a tremendous run all over the universe. Indeed, I can hardly imagine a more desirable piece of property to hold, than the ownership of this very book would be, were there (what I begin to fear, my dear Sherry, there never will be,) any comprehensive and well-regulated system of interstellar copyright.. But my friend, you look incredulous. You really can't suppose, for one moment, that I have been trifling with truth, in this little statement of mine. Shter. Oh, no, no. At the same time I confess I am greatly surprised at it. Is it possible, ther, that the gay, restless Alcibiades has settled down at last into such a staid and sedate personage as this?   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      17 That renowned lover of fun and mischief, that most enterprising, turbulent, fascinating of Greeks, sitting quietly over his fire, lost in the pages of a moral and religious romance! You must be quizzing, my friend, or else you are a sadly altered ghost, indeed. Alc. You may well say that, most illustrious of dramatists and bailiff-dodgers; you may well say that. I am an altered ghost, and I have been, ever since my first abrupt departure from this little earth. What did I ever gain, pray, by that same mercurial, enterprising nature of mine? Didn't it involve me in perpetual scrapes and disasters; not merely bringing my terrestrial career to a violent and un- timely close, didn't it also subject me to constant misrepresentations and slanders? Wasn't I a per- fect bye-word in Athens, for all that was debauched and dissolute? Did'nt all the old men in town shake their impertinent fingers at me in the streets, and all the old nurses frighten their babes into silence by threatening to call me? Was there ever a mid- night frolic, or a nose knocked from a statue, or a knocker divorced from a door, but what I always had the credit of it? When, half the time, I was really hard at work, studying my Pythagoras, or listening to the lectures of dear old Socrates, that wisest, best, ugliest of philosophers. Yes, my dear friend. it was high time for me to change my course,  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8093-00000009"/> 18      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. and to set about becoming the sober, literary spirit that you now behold me! Sher. And yet, Alcibiades, when I come to sur- vey the cut of your spiritual jib a little'more closely, I must say, I have my misgivings. There is a lurk- ing devil in that ghostly eye of yours, that tells me you are as fond of your nectar and your fun, as ever you were. Own up, now, you madcap, own up, and tell me that you have been playing upon this ingenu- ous nature of mine. Ale. Not so, oh thou most entertaining and exem- plary Englishman of thy day, not so. [Here loud cries of hot corn, hot corn, were heard in the ad- joining street]. Proserpine preserve us, what strange sounds are these? Sher. Something new to me, I assure you. But our worthy host here will elucidate the matter. [ To W. the Elder]. My dear friend, do have the good- ness to explain to us the meaning of that curious piece of vocalization, that seems to have so deeply impressed our Greek brother. W. the Elder. Why, gentlemen, that is nothing more nor less than two of our young colored brethren, duly setting forth to the community the virtues of one of our favorite national dishes, hot corn. Surely you know the article. Ale. Not I, i'faith.   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      19 Sher. Nor I. W. the Elder. You surprise me. I supposed, at least, that my English friend here was acquainted with its merits. But you shall know it, before an- other sun sets. So, come and dine with me to morrow, and I will set you vis-a-vis to some of the finest ears that ever tasseled in old Westchester. And I will also promise you as superb a dish of suc- cotash, as Both Ghosts. Succotash! S' W. the Elder. Suc-co-tash.     I don't wonder, though, at your echoing the sound. You will not find the word either in Donnegan or Ainsworth. Both name and preparation are purely aboriginal. Never mind, you must taste it, nevertheless, and if, after doing so, Alcibiades, you do not pronounce it a dish worthy to cross the lips of Olympian Jove him- self, then am I a vain boaster. But I must not in- terrupt the thread of your discourse, wherewith I was beginning to be vastly edified. Ale. This is very kind of you, my dear old friend. Let me see. When this little incident occurred, I "   was just on the point of retorting upon friend Sher- idan, his own question; namely, where he happened to be at the time your kind lightning-invitation overtook him. Sher. And Iwill answer it, all'the more willingly,  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8093-00000010"/> 20      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. my dear iconoclast, because it so happened, that it found me employed in a way most flattering to my vanity as an author. Ale. Ah,.how's that-? Sher. Listen. I was, at that very moment, in the very pleasant metropolis of Ski-hi, in the heart of the eastern hemisphere of the sun, of system num- ber sixty-six, of the sixth series of the occidental subdivision of the oriental division of-- W. the Elder. W-h-e-w! Sher. I am not at all surprised at your whistling, my dear terrestrial friend, with your limited expe- rience in the way of tipme and space; but see how coolly my brother ghost here takes it. I appeal to him for the accuracy of my description. Ale. Perfectly correct. But on with your story. What were you about there? Sher. Well, I was just going to say, that I was quietly seated in the National Theatre of said me- tropolis ; having been expressly invited there to attend the rehearsal of my own School for Scan- dal  Ale. Pardon me for interrupting you thus, but it so happens thatf it is no longer ago than yesterday, that I had a chat with Menander himself, about that same sparkling comedy of yours. He expressed himself most enthusiastically on the subject, and   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      21 even went so far as to say that it was worth all Aristophanes and himself had ever written, put to- gether; though I confess I can hardly agree with him there. W. the Elder. School for Scandal! Why it is no longer than last night, either, that I saw it most charmingly rendered, at our own little pet Lyceum. I've got the bill in my pocket now. Here it is; [reads], Lady Teazle, Miss Laura Keene; and a sweet, lady-like actress she is, too; Sir Peter, Mr. Blake; but take the document, my dear boy, and examine it at your leisure. Sher. Really, my dear friends, temporal and spir- itual, this is very polite and pleasant in you, but I shall never get to the end of my story. Alc. Go on, go on. Sher. Well, I was about saying, that I was listen- ing to the rehearsal of the play in question, by a most clever set of performers, and in the Iroquois version, when Ale. What, what, what? Iroquois-I never heard of any such language as that. Sher. Whimsiculo has, though. Have you not, my good friend? W. the' Elder. Most unquestionably, though I confess I am not particularly well posted up in it, or in its literature. I had an impression, too, that it  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8093-00000011"/> 22      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. was not a written language. Now I think of it, I did once hear the Lord's prayer in that dialect; but to say truth (and not to speak it irreverently), it sounded to me far more like a pack of crackers, go- ing off under a tin kettle, than like an invocation to the throne of grace. But how in the name of won- der, came that to be the language of the luminary in question? I     Sher. That's the very interrogatory that I pro- pounded to the manager myself, and he gave me the following lucid explanation. It seems that, from time immemorial, this particular portion of said luminary; has been set apart, as the receptacle and general place of rendezvous of the ghosts of the red men of America; that among those, ghosts, came, not many years since, the august spectre of that re- nowned sachem and warrior of the woods, Monkey- Jacket. W. the Elder. Monkey-Jacket-? no, no, no: you mean Red-Jacket.  Sher. Red-Jacket, Red-Jacket--absurd blunder, to be sure. It seems that the said Red-Jacket, a few short moons before his departure from his earthly lodgings, was the guest of the corporation of the good city of Boston; that during his visit, he was invited to attend the Tremont Theatre of that metropolis; he' did so; it so happened that the   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      23 School for Scandal was the prominent feature of the evening's entertainments. The chief, who is said to have been one of the most accomplished musicians, and finest linguists of his time, was fortunately quite himself, throughout the performance; a cir- cumstance the more extraordinary (so said the mana- ger), seeing that even his warmest admirers have been compelled to admit, that the latter portion of his terrestrial pilgrimage was pretty much one con- tinual scene of intoxication. On this occasion, how- ever, he heartily relished and warmly applauded the piece, not letting a single joke escape him. In a word, when shortly after transferred from this mun- dane sphere to the luminary before-mentioned, he took with him, in memory, the entire comedy; he would often repeat passages, and parts of scenes from it, to his brother ghosts, and was finally pre- vailed upon to give them a complete memoriter copy, in the Iroquois, which had ever been his favorite dia- lect on earth; from this copy they had gradually prepared the entertainment in question, and had in- -   vited me to be -present. It only remains to add, that :i  the performers were-nearly through  the screen- scene, and that I was in the midst of making a slight suggestion to the manager, when our host's light- ning-messenger arrived. Such, my dear Alcibiades, "*s  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8093-00000012"/> , 24    SPIRITUAL VISITORS. is a most truthful and circumstantial answer to your question. Areyou satisfied? Ale. Perfectly. But after all, what signifies it, fi   whence we came, or whither we are going? Are we not here, in sprightly Gotham, and under the hospitable roof of our old friend? Let's enjoy the present, then, and hope for many such pleasant re- unions, in the same agreeable quarters. W. the Elder. With all my heart, and I hope to have thepleasure, not only of your company, but of that of a good many other spectral notabilities, pro- vided they will condescend to honor my humble roof. And now, my lads, to supper. I think I can show you something in the terrapin department, that would, make even a French artist stare; not to      speak of a certain Sauterne, that I defy any cellar     of any planet of any system to beat. Sher. -You greatly pique our ghostly curiosity. Hi    Allons done. [Exeunt.] to   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      25 HENRY DANDOLO- PETER STUY- VESANT. Dan.

So off we trudged, post-haste, raining as it was, to St. Mark's. Dan. St. Mark's, why that's the church my pew was in. while on earth. W. the Elder. Yes, but let me tell you, my dear Doge, that your Venetian St., Mark's isn't to be spo ken of in the same century with its Second Avenue namesake. Dan. I don't doubt it. But what said Peter? What said the ex-governor? Modest ghost that he is, he was of course much embarrassed at the glow- ing language of the inscription. I know how I felt, when I was, for the first time, confronted with the fibs that they chiselled over my old carcass in Santa Sophia. W. the Elder. Well, between ourselves, I rather think Peter was somewhat mortified at the exceed- ing brevity and costiveness of the statement over   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      29 him; as well as at the painfully evident apathy of the sexton. Was it not so, Pietro Stuy. It was. HaId 1 been a fish-monger, they could hardly have handed me over to oblivion, more unceremoniously. Dan. The ungrateful creatures! That's not the way we do things in Italy, I assure you. Nay, we have uniformly, from the days of Romulus, made it a strict point of honor, after cuffing and kicking and tormenting our best benefactors and patriots, till they were right glad to be off, to make it all up to them most handsomely, at last, by right copious and classical acknowledgments, in marble. But tell us, now, Peter; you must have been completely over- whelmed with surprise and delight, at the marvelous changes and improvements that have come off in your beloved New Amsterdam, since you had stumped about in it, in the body. Stuy. Well, not so much so as I anticipated. I have been, on the whole, rather, disappointed. To be sure, there have been some changes. The town covers a few more acres than it did, in my day. There is a decided increase of dwellings and of meeting-houses. There is, unquestionably, more business transacted on 'change, and at the custom- house. There is a greater sprinkling of Yankees, and other foreigners. We certainly had no Opera,  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8093-00000015"/> 30      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. either, under my administration. But with these exceptions, and a few other small novelties, such as steamboats, and railroads, and telegraphs, and other similar trifles, I do not see those evidences of pro- gress, that i should-have anticipated from the enter- prising spirit of my cotemporaries. Dan. Why, you amaze me. The coolness of your reply is perfectly inexplicable. I shall begin to think my friend Knickerbocker was not so authentic and veracious a chronicler, after all. According to his version, your whole town might have been stowed away in one of the large hotels of the present city. Nay, does he not say, explicitly, that two hundred and fifty tallow candles would have illuminated the whole concern; and that half a dozen sNivels, and a barrel or two of gunpowder, would have been ample either for its defence or capture? Stuy. I know he does, malignant libeller that he is; and he goes on to say, that a- dozen geese would have been sufficient to have kept the whole colony in quills, for as many years ; and that its whole na- val force consisted of a solitary round-bottomed tub of a sloop of war, with a few feeble cannons and rusty fowling pieces on board; that our foreign com- mnerce consisted in the occasional visit of a lubberly craft from the mother country, loaded with fiery gin and cheap crockery; that our entire coast-wise corn-   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      31 merce was carried on in three or four leaky oyster boats; that more letters passed through a single box at the post-office, in a day, in his time, than through the whole office, in a month, in mine; and so forth, and so forth. But, my Constantinopolitan friend, were you verdant enough to believe, for one moment, statements so scandalous, so atrocious? Daln. Well, I hardly know what to say. One thing is very certain; either he has been imposing upon his readers, most shamefully, or else, which I more than half suspect, you are undertaking to play the same gamze upon me.

Yes, my dear friend, our good ex-governor here, has been in a perfect gale of excitement, the whole week; completely carried away with the wonderful and splendid things I have been showing him. He has been talking of no- thing else, day and night, and at all hours of the night, and has been teazing me continually to go here, there, and everywhere; in fine, has been thumping about, with that old silver-mounted leg of his, like a very Rochester knocker.

Why, Dandolo, it was only yesterday that we were at the High Bridge together, and at the Reservoirs, and I never saw a ghost go on so, before. Such delight, such rapture! And so at every place; at Green- wood, at the Atlantic Dock, at Castle Garden, at the Astor, and all along our thronged and tumultuous Broadway: one eternal string of questions and ex- clamations!  Tie would insist upon seeing every- thing, from the Collins' Steamers down to Colt's Revolvers; from the Metropolitan down to the Pew ter Mug. Nay more, spiritual cripple that he is, he would hobble up to the top of Trinity steeple, where he kept me two mortal hours, prattling about the Battery, as it was in his time, and Corlaer's Hook, and Pawlus' Hook, and Gibbet Island, and Quaog, and Patchogue, and the Connecticut Moss Troopers, and heaven knows what besides. Especially did he contrast his own little, long ago extinct, parish church of St. Nicholas, (which he was sadly puzzled to lo- cate,) with the superb cathedral below us. Come, Peter, do tell our Venetian brother here, all about it. Sttuy. Oh, I can't begin to do it. It would take at least ten encycloppedias to do justice to my feel- ings. Dan. But of all the things you have seen, my friend, what, on the whole, gratified you the most?   StUy. My own portrait, in the Governor's room of the Hotel de la Ville; though, to be sure, I didn't recognize it, at first.  That, and another master- piece with my name attached to it, at Barnum's Louvre. Dan. Ah, by Rembrandt ? Stuy. No, by Jenkins : in his first manner, before he had fairly emancipated himself from the shackles of the Sing-Sing school. W. the Elder. Oh, Peter, do be serious. Do tell Harry about our trip to Hell Gate, and Williams- burgh, and Brooklyn, that little babe of a place, (as you said,) when you last saw it, that stately queen of a city that you now find it; tell him how you stood spell-bound, on the Heights, lost in admiration of the magnificent panorama before you; tell him how astounded you were at the improvements at Com- munipaw; tell him how curiously you eyed, and how decidedly you relished that mint-julep at the Carlton; how you smoked and stared, and stared and smoked, at the Telegraph office, in the vain attempt to de- cypher the mystery thereof. Tell him how you en- joyed yourself last night, at Burton's, even unto ob- streperousness, nay, almost unto expulsion, while watching the eccentric proceedings of Toodle.

But above all, dear Peter, tell him of our trip up the Hudson; with what delight you gazed upon the fleet of gallant ships and steamers, from all the corners -of the earth; how forgetting yourself for a moment, you inquired  of an aged colored wood-sawyer, on the way to the  boat, what dock the Albany schooners started from, , and how, supposing you drunk or crazy, he vouch-  safed no answer; how you hobbled around among the hotel-coaches and express-wagons ; how you consign- ed an impertinent news-boy to the pit without a bot- tom; what owl-like looks you gave the machinery, after we had got aboard; how you were looking out for Bloomingdale, long after we had passed Spuyten  Deyvel; how completely astounded and petrified you : were, at the interminable procession of sloops and  schooners and barges and propellers, that we met and passed continually; how you looked, when that cattle train, half a mile long, whizzed by us, just be-  low Yonkers; how charmed you were with all the  pretty towns and villas and gardens; how you long- ed to go ashore at Nyack, and investigate the where-  abouts of some orchards that you remembered rob- bing, when a boy ; how you guffawed, when we came abreast of Anthony's Nose; how you blasphemed  about the missing sour-crout at dinner; what capers : you cut, when the blessed old Kaatskills hove in  : *i   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      35 sight; how you whistled, as the words Rip Van Winkle, caught your eye, at the stern of a safety- barge; and how supremely bewildered and delight- ed you were, shortly after, when you saw your own honored name on the guards of a magnificent new steamer, all dressed out in flags, and crowded with passengers; how-but what's the matter with our friend Dandolo, all of a sudden? he looks unwell. Stuy. Why, Harry, my boy, you are not well. How sad and distressed you look. What's the mat- ter? Dan. Ah, Peter, I am sad. I am distressed. But let me explain myself. While our mutual friend here, was rehearsing your recent pleasant journey, sorrowful thoughts came suddenly over my-soul, and I could not forbear contrasting, with mingled anguish and bitterness of spirit, our different experiences. You, Peter, left your loved Gotham, a tender plant, skirting the southern borders of your pleasant is- land; with the elements of growth in it, certainly; still, an obscure, peaceful spot, little dreaming of the magnificent future that was in store for it. You re- turn, and find it a stately metropolis, teeming with life and beauty and energy, and fast becoming the leading city of the earth. Now mark the difference. When I left Venice for the land of spirits, she had almost reached the consummation of her glory.  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8093-00000018"/> 36      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. Boundless her wealth, world-wide her commerce (at least as we then knew the world,) invincible her power; the mistress of the seas, the arbitress of na- tions. You had but to strike the bell of old St. Mark's, and a hundred thousand armed men would show themselves within an hour. -What port knew not her galleys, what mart her merchants? Art, it is true, had not yet given her all those magnificent palaces; had not bestowed upon her all those ex- quisite graces, that afterwards made her the world's pride and wonder: still was she a superb, a glorious creation. Look at her, now! Poor, sick, dying city; dying, dying, and scarce a friend left to close her eyes; her government extinguished, her commerce all melted away, her citizens in exile, her mansions desolate, and her poor self in the clutches of a power, alike stupid and malignant. Yes, the scenes that in my day were all alive with mirth and music, and gay pageants, are now as sullen and silent as the grave. What right have I, then, to be cheerful? What right have I to be wandering here, even, and enjoying your society? I ought, this very moment, to be haunting the scenes of our former glory. I ought to appear, this 'very night, armed cap-a-pie, to frown upon, and appal our oppressors, and to arouse the drooping spirits of my dear countrymen. I ought--   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      37 Stzty. Harry, Harry, my boy, don't take on so. This is a sad, an unhappy business, to be sure. But, my dear ghost, what good can you do, now? 'Tis all too late, my friend; the die is cast, the destinies will have it so, and poor old Venice must be choked, at last, in the slime of her own canals. But cheer up, brother spirit, cheer up. And tell us, Hal, how long you have been in town, and where are you stop- ping 1 Dan. Nearly six weeks. I am putting up at the Irving. Stuy. The deuce you are. Dan. And pray, where are you? Stuy. At the St. Nicholas. I had a special in- vitation from the landlord to be present at its inau- guration. Dan. Had I known it, I should have certainly called on you. But the truth is, I have been but little of the time in town. In fact, I have been very busy for the last month, exploring the wonders, and studying the institutions of this glorious, this Titanic republic of yours. I have special reason to remem- ber the day of my arrival here, however. It was the day of the great Sontag Serenade. W. the Elder. Indeed, and did you assist at that beautiful tribute to genius? Dan. I did; and, what is more, I inadvertently i  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8093-00000019"/> 38      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. wore a white hat, on the occasion, as did my brother- ghost who accompanied me; two superb Rocky Mountain beavers, which we had purchased, that very afternoon, at Leary's. We were standing to- gether, at a somewhat advanced hour of the night, I remember, directly under the balcony of the hotel of the Queen of Song, waiting patiently for the music, and discussing the merits of Jenny Lind; when, in the twinkling of. an eye, we were both, most uncere- moniously, bereft of the aforesaid beavers. Alike angry and mortified, I inquired of a terrestrial neigh- bor, the meaning of this extraordinary proceeding. He simply replied, that it was a part of the cere- mony, a time-honored custom here, whenever such summer evening entertainments were made public. Why, then, said I, was it not so stated in the pro- gramme? Then my friend and myself could have provided ourselves with cheap substitutes. As it is, we have been flung out of six dollars a piece, by the operation. A horse-laugh was his only reply. So home we trudged, feeling like fools, and contracting obstinate colds in our spiritual heads besides, which we have not got rid of yet. But, my friends, I am afraid I shall have to break up our colloquy. Stuy. Why so? Dan. Why, the fact is, the Chicago River and Harbor Convention meets now, lin about two minutes   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      39 and a half, and I have promised to be present, and to lay before the meeting, some very valuable and interesting statistics, concerning the commerce of Venice, in the 12th century.

Some other time, my dear fellow. Besides, what was that affair, after all, alongside of his own magnificent capture of Fort Christina? But I must positively be off. So, farewell, friends. Dan.

Need I say how charmed I am to meet my brother student of Nature, in the metropolis that he hath embellished with so many lovely pic- tures? Cole. Really, my dear friend, you flatter me. Such'praise from such an artist is Rub. Is the simple truth. Pardon my interrupt- ing you thus, but I spoke from a most hearty and profound admiration. 'Twas but yesterday, my dear ghost, that I saw your masterpiece, the "Course of Empire." He, who put that poem on canvas, must not be too modest. Charming, charming work! I had the day before been to see some of your land. scapes. and was delighted. I speak not merely of your transcripts from your own wild, fresh America,   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      41 nor of your compositions, but also of your most fe- licitous renderings of Italian, and Greek, and Swiss, and Sicilian, and English scenes. All, all alike truthful and beautiful. Kenilworth, by the way, my friend, was no ivy-dressed ruin, but a sumptuous palace in my time ; and some of those stately oaks that you have introduced in your sketch of Windsor, I am confident, were not there, when I had the honor of waiting on his Majesty King Charles. Ah! dear, it seems a thousand ages since then. Your "Voy- age of Life," too, and your "Past and Present," and above all, your "' Departure and Return," delighted me. The tender sentiment that pervades this last, fairly brought the tears to my eyes.   Brother Claude must look to his laurels. With all his glow- ing skies, and limpid waves, he hasn't a tenth part of your invention. He never read any such beauti- fill lessons, never preached any such glorious sermons as your pencil has, from the great volume of nature. No, nor Salvator, with all his fire and romance. Cole. Why, you surprise, even more than you gratify me.  To be told this, too, by one himself so illustrious, the prince of colorists, the brilliant, the versatile Rubens, the Flernish Raphael, -as we all call you ; it is, indeed, far beyond my humble merits. Rub. Not at all. I say again, I speak the sim- ple truth. I am no flatterer, and if I were, I should  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8093-00000021"/> 42      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. not dare to approach you with any such language. Your ingenuous nature, I know, holds in utter scorn aught that savors of flattery or falsehood. Cole. May I inquire, seeing that this is our first meeting, into the origin of your good opinion? Rub. Certainly. It comes in part, then, (and you must excuse my being thus personal,) from irresisti- ble first impressions, but more especially, from the statements of our mutual friend, Alston. Cole. What, my dear brother Alston? Rub. The same. - He has told me all about you; your toils, your struggles, the slow, but sure recog- nition of your genius by your countrymen, and your ultimate brilliant success. He told me many inter- esting things, too, of your country and its heart-stir- ring history, and also of this pleasant metropolis, that I now, thanks to the kind invitation of our h6nor- ed friend and medium here, am visiting for the first time. Cole. But, do tell me, where is our dear friend? I have been most anxious to meet and confer with him. Is it long since you met?  Rub. No, quite recently. I am surprised that you have not found out your compatriot, long since. He is now in Herschel, and hard at work, I, can as sure you. Cole. May I ask the subject of his labors?   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      43 Rub. He is busy painting the plafonds of a suite of apartments in the superb palace, belonging to his illustrious brother Herschelian, and former fellow- countryman, whom they called on earth Alexander Hamilton. Cole. Ah! I am delighted to hear you say so. But what is the design? Something grand, of course. Rub. Magnificent, magnificent. But I am not at liberty to divulge it. To say truth, he wishes to surprise the good people of that planet. Even his own patron hasn't yet ventured to take a peep at it. One thing the artist told me, however; that nothing he had done on this ball, could give one any idea of its merits: a statement, by the way, which I intend to verify, in proprio spiritz, before leaving the hemisphere. And whom do you suppose he has for a neighbor? No less a ghost than Titian himself. Hardly a day passes without his consulting him up- on the work.; and he in turn, has given Titian a good many valuable suggestions, relative to the still more arduous task, on which he is himself engaged. Cole. And pray, what may that be? Rub. The entire supervision of a superb cathe dral, destined, when completed, to be by all odds, the finest in the system. Every portion -of the work, architecture, sculpture, painting and decorations, are  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8093-00000022"/> "     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. to be after designs by the great master. A colossal undertakin, is it not? He has been at it now most' faithfully for the last two years, and there is a world of work to be done yet. W. the Elder. Two years? Why that don't seem to me such a long time, for a job like that you speak of. Rub. You forget, my dear friend; we are talking of Herschelian years, every one of which is a good deal more than threescore and ten of your little ter- restrial ones. W. the Elder. True, true; I ask pardon. You don't happen, by the way, to have a Herschel, Alma- nac in your spiritual pocket, do you? Rub. I am sorry to say I have not. Here is last week's Georgiurm Sidus Advocate, though. Per- haps you may find something interesting in it. W. the Elder. Thank you, thank you, (pocketing the paper). But I must apologise for this interrup- tion. You were about saying Rub. True; I was just about remarking to my dear brother here, how often I have since regretted that I did not devote more of my earthly hours to that walk of art in which he has won such laurels. I always had a hankering for it, and the few land- scapes I did paint; such as they are, I painted with real relish.   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      45 Cole. I have often wished myself that you had given the world more of them. But of course you had to consult the wishes of your patrons. Rub. Yes, confound them, and they would insist, quite too often, either on stupid allegories, or else on mere voluptuous pictures. Ah! my dear Cole, I am afraid there are quite too many things of mine even now on earth, that are doing no good to the morals of the rising generation. I am quite ashamed of myself, when I think how much of my time and canvas I expended upon leering nymphs and drunken satyrs, and such like abominations. Cole. Ah! you judge yourself too harshy, my friend. There certainly are things that you had better have left alone, but when I consider the whole course of your career on earth, these few exceptional works seem mere spots upon the sun. Yes, when I call to mind your magnificent Scripture-pieces, your superb historical works, your matchless portraits, your grand draperies, your delicious combinations of colors, I am lost in amazement at the fertility and facility of your genius. Rub. My conscience will smite me, though at times. And the kindness of your criticism only re- minds me, how far you surpass me in this regard. No impure or unworthy thought disfigures any per-  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8093-00000023"/> "     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. formance of yours ; certainly none that I have yet seen, Cole. Yes, but then, my friend, I was not tempt- ed as you were. I had no such versatility to lead me astray; still less, such rich, powerful and capri- cious patrons. It is not so easy to disobey the or- ders of crowned heads, you know. Rub. Pretty silly and worthless ones, between ourselves, too many of them, crowned though they were. I wish to heaven I had been out, studying the fair face of nature, or exploring the windings of some such glorious river as this Hudson of yours, in- stead of wasting so much paint and labor as I did, on that worthless Medici Gallery. Cole. And yet, the master's hand is visible through- out it. Every student of his art would be very sor- ry to lose it, I can tell you. But how came you, my friend, to mix up Christendom and Heathendom, so strangely in it, and I must add, so unjustifiably? Rub. Well, I hardly know how to answer your question. The truth is, my dear Cole, in all my performances, both before and since leaving earth, I have been governed quite too much by impulse, and too little by rule. I seem to have painted from the very start because I couldn't help it. Before I was fairly out of my earthly long-clothes, I remember going at it, and executing portraits of dogs and cats,   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      47 and cabbages; everything, in short, that ca-me in my way. And so throughout my terrestrial career. I must always be painting something, no matter what, from the gaping watermelon of my garden, up to the monarch that I served; from the plump, rud- dy matrons around me, up to the saints and seraphs of my dreams. Such was the Lord's will; such his commission to me, not only on earth, but in other worlds; and even now, my friend, it makes me quite unhappy to lose a day from my studio. Cole. I sympathize with you most heartily, my dear spirit. But to come down to our worthy host's day and generation; may I ask how long you have been in town? Rub. It is just ten days since I arrived, and most of the time has been spent in the company of Whim- siculo here, who, I need not tell you, has been all attention. A lovely city, truly, this Gotham of yours. We have nothing in Flanders, and never had, to compare with it. I believe we have explored pretty much all the prominent lions, have we not, W.? W. the Elder. Well, we have been pretty busy. Cole. You looked in at the Dusseldorf Gallery, of course. Ruth. Oh, yes; some  charming things there; though, as a whole, I must say, I do not altogether like the spirit that pervades that school. They  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8093-00000024"/> 48      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. seem to me to waste their strength on trifles; finish- ing the accessories of their scenes with painful mni- nuteness, and sadly neglecting the actors themselves, and then their landscapes appear equally full of superfluous finery, and equally devoid of genuine feeling. Don't you agree with me? Cole. I certainly do, though somewhat of a sinner in that way myself. Less elaboration and more sentiment would improve them all. But have you been to the Bryan Gallery? Rub. I have-; more than once, too. Cole. An admirable collection, isn't it? Rub. Indeed it is. Not so grand or costly, of course, as many that I have seen in my day, nor so valuable as the one I myself owned, when in the flesh, and which I sold, most unwillingly, I remem- ber, to that scamp, the Duke of Buckingham; still a charming assemblage, and full of gems. Cole. You recognized a good many old acquaint- ances in the gallery, did you not? Rub. Oh, yes; the first thing that my eyes lit upon, was brother Hemling's "Marriage of St. Catherine;," quite an old picture, in my day, and certainly a most charming one. I always loved the placid beauty of his saints, and the orderly group- ing of his angels; very different from my tumultu- ous style. And right under him, I recognised no   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      49 less a hand than my old fellow-townsman, Matsys, though, to be sure, he died fifty years before I was born. Many a time have I played tag round his wall in Antwerp, when a boy. And right alongside of him was brother Mabuse, too, with his exquisite- ly finished little pictures. Old acquaintances, say you? Lots of them ; not merely my own pupils and countrymen, either; but there are works here that I remember distinctly having seen in the studios, both of my Spanish friend Velasquez, and of my most illustrious and amiable Italian brother, Do- menichino. Cole. By the way, what a sweet little picture that is of his ; I mean the '"St. Paul carried up to Hea- ven by angels ;" between ourselves, I think it the gem of the collection. Rub. I don't know but what I agree with you. It certainly is a most spirited and expressive thing. How it contrasts with the wooden uniformity of some of its Byzantine neighbors; and even with those of Cimabue and Giotto. Is it not 'perfectly amazing, my dear friend, to think of the triumphs achieved by our art, in two little centuries? Con- trast the most insignificant performance of our an- gelic brother, Raphael, with even the masterpiece, of Guido of Sienna, for instance, and what a world- wide difference!

You surely don't mean to disavow them?                       -A Rub. Disavow them? no, indeed. What should put that idea in your head?  Cole. Well, I have no doubts, myself, on the sub- ject. But you need not be told, my dear brother, of the innumerable quackeries and falsehoods that have disgraced the great majority of picture-gatherers, in all stars and ages. Rub. Alas, it is too true. Had I myself painted one-hundredth part of the earthly pictures attribu- ted to me, I would have wanted the years of Methu-  saleh, and the hands of Briareus besides. But there can be no mistake here, my friend. I remember dis-   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      51 tinctly the circumstances connected with the execu- tion of the works in question. W. the Elder. Ah, do tell us, my honored guest, do tell us. It is indeed pleasant, in this world of mysteries and misgivings, now and then to have a fact authenticated, direct from spiritual head-quar- ters. Tell us all about it. Rub. Well, I don't mean to say that I can give you the minute particulars, at this distance of time. I can recall the Susanna, however, very clearly, and the rich old burgher of Antwerp, for whom I painted it; as amiable an old fellow as I ever knew, but somewhat too much given to jollity and grossness. He would insist on having his wife, (a fine portly figure, much stouter, indeed, than I have made her,) painted in this character. I suggested putting her'- in a Holy Family, but' he wouldn't listen to it, .and so the poor thing and myself-both had to submit. The Elders are portraits of two Ecclesiastics of the town, notorious hypocrites and sensualists in their day, and especially obnoxious to my plain-spoken old friend. On the whole, I regret having painted the picture. Cole. To be candid with you, it is not at all to my taste. But the St. Catherine I was charmed with. Rub. Bless her sweet saintship, I remember that  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8093-00000026"/> '52     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. I took great pleasure in painting her. I remember, too, how my friends congratulated me on the per- formance: they said I had surpassed myself on the occasion. I had quite a talk with the proprietor, about this picture, wherein he explained to me the circumstances of his ownership; and I must say, my dear friend, that while I might have preferred that it should have remained in its native land, I am quite delighted that it has fallen into such good hands. The cordial, appreciative way in which he spoke about it, was most flattering to my ghostly vanity. Indeed, he took me all through the collec- tion, and I found his remarks alike agreeable and instructive. Cole. But tell me, Rubens, did you really paint the Hercules? Rub. I am inclined to think so, though I cannot exactly locate it, as you New Englanders say. I certainly must have had a hand in it. Let me see. Now I think of it, I do recall it. Yes, yes, I had begun upon the hero, I remember, when I was sud- denly called away from town to my chateau, for a day or two, to entertain some dear friends at Mantua; I on my return, how surprised and delighted was I to find the piece finished by my scholars.

I am right glad to hear it thus spoken of by the first landscape-painter of his day. Yes, my friend, I well remember dashing off that little thing. I was in fine spirits at the time, I tell you. Why it was only two days before my marriage with my sec- ond wife, my sweet, lowing, lovely Helen. I think you will find some, of the painter's glee transferred to his canvas, in this instance. Cole. -Yes, indeed. No dull brain, or unhappy disposition could have ever given birth to a thing like that. But what's the matter with our host?     He seems to be in a  brown study. Rub. Holloa, landlord, a guinea for your thoughts. W. the Elder. A  doubloon, and they are yours. But seriously, friends, I was thinking how improba- ble it was, that I should ever again have the honor of entertaining two such illustrious ghosts, at my humble lodgings. Rub.

You are pretty near the end of your terrestrial rope, old gentleman. Don't that frosty pow of yours tell you as much, when you shave o' mornings? And then, my boy, we shall be better acquainted, I hope. W. the Elder. By the way, Rubens, there is one of our metropolitan lions that I have neglected show- ing you. Rub. And what may that be? W. the Elder. Had you left town without seeing it, I should never have forgiven myself. Rub. What is it, what is it? W. the Elder. Why, it is no less a thing than that magnificent series of pictures, that commemo- rates the virtues of the renowned Mustang Lini- ment. Brother Cole must forgive me, for speaking plainly.-He knows I am a warm admirer of his. I have gazed with delight on his "Voyage of Life" and "Course of Empire," many a long day in summer; but it would be gross flattery to him, to compare i either of those series with the wonderful group of tableaux in question.

In fact, I have promised to put my name on the back of a piece of paper, for a brother artist, in an adjacent comet; a whole-souled fellow, full of genius, but not so flush as he ought to be. He seems to think my endorse- ment may be of service to him; and he must have it, of course. Cole. I must be going, too. Rub. Whither away, dear friend? Cole. Back to my labors. While the light lasts, I wish to put the finishing touches to a picture, that I am a good deal interested in. Rub. May I ask what it is? Cole. Certainly. It is a large landscape, -compo- sition, that I design as a present to a valued friend, formerly of this very city, and now in heaven. I call it "Reminiscences of Earth." It is, indeed, a compilation, so to speak, of choice Italian, Swiss, and Grecian scenery, with a leaf or two from my own loved Kaatskills. Rub. I would love dearly to see it. Cole. And why not?

Welcome, thrice welcome to our dear young brother of Columbia. It is a long time since we have had the pleasure of a meeting. Drake. It is indeed; not since that charming en- tertainment given by Hesiod in honor of our friend Wordsworth. Pin. Even so. A right pleasant gathering it was, too, as you say. Such choice spirits don't often get together, Drake. Drake. You may well say that. Let's see; there was Homer and Cleanthes, and Corinna and Mil- ton, and Tasso and Horace, and Byron and Sappho, and Shakspeare; to say nothing of the honored guest himself, and our host of a host, and your own illustrious hardship.

You Scarce opened your lips, I remember. Drake. Did not silence become me best, in the presence of such renowned children of Parnassus? Pin. Ah! you're too modest, by half. The au- thor of the Culprit Fay, too,- Drake. A trifle, my friend, a mere trifle. Pin. A trifle, indeed! Ah! had you heard what Shakspeare said about it, you- Drake. What, did the great poet himself conde- scend to notice it? Pin. To be sure he did. He pronounced it in- comparably the finest thing of the kind in his lan- guage. His own Queen Mab's chariot (he went on to say), he flattered himself was an ingeniously got up little contrivance; but your fairy's boat, and in- deed, all his armor and outfit, were far more dainty and delicate creations. The whole poem, he added, in its conception and execution, reminded him of one of those matchless cups of Benvenuto Cellini, so prized on earth, wherein the amazing prodigality of the artist's fancy was only equalled by the exquisite finish of the details. Drake. This was, indeed, most kind in him. Pin. He meant what he said, too. There was no mistaking the cordial enthusiasm of his manner. I told him that I agreed with him most decidedly, and   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      59 moreover, that the Midsummer Night's Dream, and the Culprit Fay, were stored side by side in the chambers of my memory. Drake. Why, my dear friend, you quite over- whelm me. Such praise, and so sanctioned! To be spoken of thus, and by the renowned Pindar him- self; Pindar, the prince of poets, and the guest of princes; whose odes have been chanted before ad- miring thousands, by the most illustrious youths and loveliest virgins of Greece ;- the distributor of fame, whose verse immortalized whate'er it touched; whose coronation-hymns- Pin. Why, holloa, holloa, what are you about? You are paying me off in my own coin, with a ven- geance. But to convince you, my dear boy, of the sincerity of my admiration. 'twas but a few days ago, that I amused myself by turning several pas- sages of your charming little poem into Greek. Would you like to hear a verse or two? I confess I should be pleased to have your opinion as to the merits of the translation. Drake. It would gratify me exceedingly. Pin. Well then, have at you.

W. the Elder. I really ask pardon, gentlemen, for this most unseasonable and apparently ill-bred guffaw. These absurd incongruities, however, will occur sometimes in this queer world of ours. Pin. But who is this wandering minstrel? And what god or hero's exploits is he commemorating? W. the Elder. The bard in question, is our. esti- mable townsman, Wm. Smith, sole proprietor and vender of the Great Columbian Nonpariel Razor- strop. He is chanting his customary orphic hymn to the masses. Don't stare so, my sweet Swan of Thebes; I speak the simple truth; but listen for yourself. Pin. Verily, it is so. But, my old friend, I did not quite catch the purport of the last stanza. Bowlegs, Bowlegs-what, in Pluto's name, does he mean by Bowlegs? W. the Elder. Oh, yes, yes. He has just been telling the crowd, how Rough and Ready, Old Hick- ory, Old Chippewa, Old Tippecanoe, Wellington, Kossuth, Soult, Bowlegs, Charles Albert, in fact, all the military notabilities of the nineteenth century, have tested the merits of the aforesaid strop upon their rusty razors, and have sent him grateful epis- tles in return. The lines that so impressed you,   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      61 were neither more nor less than the versified state- ment of General William Bowlegs, as to its trans- cendent virtues. But what say you? Would you like one of the articles? Only a couple of drachmas. Perhaps, you would like an introduction to the min- strel himself? You'll find him a right good fellow. Pin. Not to-day, my friend. Besides, I do: not allow any cold steel ever to profane this ghostly beard of mine. W. the Elder. Well then, now for our little fay. I long to see him in his Greek costume. Pin. No, no, no; some other time; I have no idea of entering the lists, or of permitting my friend here to do so, against a champion so illustrious as this, whose strains we are now devouring. He seems to be moving off, though. Ah! how sweetly those dying notes salute my ear. Drake. But, my dear Pindar, to revert to our friend Hesiod's complimentary supper. Brother Wordsworth acquitted himself, on the whole, most admirably, did he not? Pin. Indeed he did; a little stiff and dignified at first, perhaps; but as he warmed up, he became quite charming. Those lines of his, in acknowledg- ment of the entertainment, were really delicious; full of feeling, full of fancy Drake. I had no idea he was such an improvisa-  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8093-00000031"/> 62      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. tore, either. How happily he responded to Corin- na's compliments, when she handed him that exqui- site bouquet. You remember the circumstance, per- haps. Pin. As if it were yesterday. The very flowers themselves, seemed to blush afresh, at the pretty things he said about them. Drake. No poet was ever more at home among the flowers; alike the gay belles of the garden, and the humble children of the wayside. Pin. And then, when Milton's own honored hands crowned him with laurels, he looked so serene and stately, a nd modest withal, that I was quite, delight- ed with him. By the way, how is it that Byron and he always fight so shy of each other? Drake. I hardly know why it is. They never seem to have agreed, either on earth, or since. What a pity that two such glorious masters and profound observers, who have really so much in common, should have always misunderstood each other. I can't help thinking it is Byron's fault, though. 'A pretty wayward ghost, entre nous; very sweet and fascinating at times, very proud and moody at others. Pin. Poor Byron! that beautiful face- of his is quite too often tinged with sadness. Even in his   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      63 happiest hours have I seen a gloom, as black as sudden, take possession of his soul. Drake. Recollections doubtless, of his tumultu- ous, sorrowful career on earth. He'll soon recover his serenity, though, and for good I trust; -he'll think better of his brother-poet, then. Pin. They'll find each other out in time, depend upon it. But, friend Drake, do tell us, have you been long on the planet, and do you intend making anything of a stay? Drake. Only a day or two; a brief business vis- it; though it has been an exceedingly pleasant one thus far. Never, dear Pindar, did our earth appear more beautiful to me, than when it first hove in sight this time. Say what you will, and apart from all prejudices in its favor, as our honored birth-place, there are few finer planets in the heavens. Pin. It certainly does hold its own among its brother and sister stars. But, what time of day was it, and whereabouts were you, when you got the first glimpse of it? Drake, In the morning, and pretty well up to- wards the north pole. The first thing I saw was a group of magnificent icebergs, glittering like dia- monds, and shooting up their splendid spires into the heavens.  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC8093-00000032"/> "     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. Pin. And what were the first indications of life you encountered? Drake. Guess. Pin. How should I know. A company of jolly bears, waltzing and polking, on a foating cake of ice. No? Drake. Ah! no, my friend; something far more interesting and pathetic than that, I can tell you. Pin. What,fpray  Drake. What, but our own dear flag, at the stern of as gallant a little craft as- -Pin. The flag that you have immortalized . Why, that was .a pleasant rencontre. Drake. It had immortalized itself thrice over, long before I had anything to say about it. Pin. Modest as usual, I see. But what was it doing up in those chilling regions? Some boundary business, I suppose; some new annexations. Will your Yankee nation never be satisfied? Haven't they play-ground enough for their youngsters al- ready? W. the Elder. No, sir. We want the entire ball, and what's more, we mean to have it. But, I ask pardon, my friends, for interrupting you thus. My patriotic feelings got the better of me for a mo- ment. Drake, No, no, my dear boy, it was on no such   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      65 errand, I assure you; no vessel of war, either ; but a messenger of peace, sent by a princely -merchant of this very town; bound on a mission of love and mercy; going in quest of a lost adventurer, whose zeal for science had entangled himself and his brave crew in those perilous regions. Poor fellows, I fear the search is all too late. I fear they have long since perished. Gladly would I have accompanied the expedition in its beneficent labors, but necessity summoned me hither, and so I e'en left them, and with my heartiest benediction. Pin. Heaven speed them, and may they yet find and .release their brethren! What a captivity, what an exile from home and kindred! Brave fellows, indeed; true heroes, far more worthy of the Muses' homage, than ninety-nine hundredths of those whose praises I sang on earth. Talk of Alexander and his Indian conquests, -nay, of the labors of Hercules himself; what were they, compared with such a magnificent crusade against nature, as this! W. the Elder. Such expeditions were not very common in your day, brother P., were they? I ask,  j because I saw no mention made of the use of the Globes, in the programme of the Boeotian Acade- wmy as advertised in the columns of that ThebaT7 Mirror you were so kind as to lend me. Pin.

Geography was a small affair in our schools. It was the grammar, my old friend, the grammar, that used to bother us boys so; that used to cost us such terrible thrash- ings. But I was about asking brother Drake if he had seen any of his old earthly friends, since his arrival? Drake. A few; I have just returned from Long Island, from a call on brother Bryant. Pin. What, he who wrote Thanatopsis ; the poem that Milton is so fond of quoting, ana that he told me, he considered the grandest funeral hymn, that had ever been chanted over humanity? Drake. The same; I am sorry to say, however, that I found him writing politics, not poetry Pin. Why, the renegade! To turn his back thus upon the Muses, who have behaved so generously towards him. Drake. So I told him. 1 scolded him right heart- ily, I assure you. - "Ah!" said he, " it's of no use talking. Your remonstrances come too lalte. Dis- tasteful as this fierce partizanrwarfare is, and ever was to me, I shall never get out of it, I shall die in harness. In some brighter and better world, per- haps, I may renew my vows, retune my lyre; not here, not here." He smiled as he said this, in a   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      67 half-playful, half-serious way, that quite moved me. I had just been talking with my dear friend Hal- leck, and taking him to task for the same offence, that very morning. Pin. Ah! and how is brother Bozzaris? Hearty, I trust. No true Greek can ever hear his name without pleasure. You know how often I have made you recite those spirit-stirring lines of his. I'd rather have written that ode, than any twenty of mine, that I remember. How is he, and what was his reply to your charge? Drake. I rejoice to say that I found him right well, and as cordial as ever. He laughingly referred me to his executors. True, said I, I've no doubt they'll find a great many gems among your MSS., but why not let them see the light, before you go  Why not let your brethren crown the living man with laurels, instead of the cold marble? Pin. And what did he say to that? Drake. He only laughed again, and poured out for me a glass of as delicious claret, as ever warmed a ghostly stomach, or clarified a ghostly brain. "There," said he, "I consider that worth all the MSS. that lean book-worms ever bent over, all the busts that irritable antiquarians ever squabbled about.

Finding the case thus hopeless, I changed the sub- ject. But, my dear Pindar, I had far rather listen to the story of your adventures, than be repeating my own. I am sure they must be -far more enter- taining. Pin. Not at all; I have nothing to say for my- self, worth listening to. To say truth, I had been a very sedentary ghost for some time previous to receiving old Medium's note, here. Drake. And what has been the' nature of your studies? Pin. Well, somewhat out of my customary line. I have been trying my hand at a comedy. Drake. Indeed! What do you call it? Pin. The Slow Coach. The principal hero, or rather victim thereof, is no other than that ineffable bore, Priscian. You know him, of course. Drake. Yes, though I never had the pleasure of meeting him. Pin. Most fortunate of ghosts! Heaven spare you from any such collision! Drake. You mean, of course, the individual who wrote the poem on Weights and Measures. Pin. The same; he also, you may remember, put the Roman tariff of A.

The old nuisance has been especially hard on- me of late; stopping me in the streets, pouncing upon me in lobbies and concert-rooms, and sending me eternal copies of his trashy performances. And so I was determined at last to have my revenge. Drake. You have not been unmerciful, I hope. Pin. Well, I must say, I have made him as ridi- culous as I could. He certainly performs some won- derful feats in the course of the piece. In the very first scene, he effectually quiets the nerves of a poor patient, with an elegant extract from his epic poem of Lucretia, preparatory to the extraction of a couple of old aching molars. In the second act, the curtain falls on the snores of a sufferer, whom he has put to rest with a single stanza from his Tribute to the Memory of Epaminondas. In the third act, a learned judge sentences a prisoner, duly convicted of arson, to the daily recital for six months, of the first speech of Ogyges, in his tragedy of that name. In the fourth, with ten little lines from his Ode to Duty, he triumphantly disperses a crowd, upon which two perusals of the Riot Act, followed up by as many volleys of darts and javelins, had make--no impres- sion whatever. What wonders his Muse is to work in the fifth act, I have not yet decided.

There can be no punish- ment too severe for such offences. What right has the old humbug to bore and torment me thus? Let him stick to his Syntax.

How fortunate that I met you. I wouldn't have missed it for worlds. What apity, though, that our excellent host here, can't go with us. Pin. It is, indeed; my dear old friend, however, must see at a glance, the utter impossibility of the thing.

You must know that she enacted the arduous part of Juliet, last night, at the Astor Place Theatre, to her Italian friend Cupid's Romeo; and, what. with the excite- ment of the performance itself, and the unreasonable quantity and size of the bouquets that were discharged at her, at the close, she is really quite an invalid this morning. But, that she is positively underlined for to-morrow night, as Mrs. Haller, (not to speak of her having to preside at a Sluts' Rights Meeting, this evening,) I should insist upon a week's rustica- tion for the restoration of her nervous system.

My good friend, I do not wish to be un- reasonable; but when I tell you, that the cloak in Add  question constitutes, and has for many centuries, constituted my entire wardrobe, you will perceive at once, the embarrassing nature of your request.

To be sure, a dainty fellow, like Plato, might have been annoyed at find- ing a score of pigs in the reception room; or a Lu- cullus, have experienced some little uneasiness of stomach, at seeing so many old quids lying about on the breakfast table; but the arrangements suited me to a charm. I do not know when I have slept more sweetly, or have had more seraphic dreams, than I did last night; which I mainly attribute to having had one of the aforesaid pigs for a pillow. That, and the pleasure of the company of a regiment of rats, or so-- W. the Elder. Say no more, old fellow, and for heaven's sake, stay where you are.

The first on General Scott, to congratulate him on his election. W. the Elder. Why, confound your impertinence! What, go out of your way, thld very first thing, to insult an illustrious patriot in his downfall? I am ashamed of you. Diog. EIbeg your pardon. I acted in good faith. It was my scamp of a landlord, that misled me. Didn't he tell me this very morning, that the Gene- ral had carried every State in the Union, except twenty-seven, and that he only wanted three or four millions of illegal votes from the old country, to have secured them also? Didn't he add, too, that it was my duty as an illustrious stranger, to call upon the old hero, as he was passing through the city, and present my felicitations? W. the Elder.

Ah! my friend, that was indeed a sight to be remembered ; far, far different from the elaborate pomp of the English pageant, but, to my mind, far more touching and beautiful, nay, sublime in its simplicity; far more in keeping with the grandeur of the character, and genius of him, whom they thus honored. I shall never forget the scene; the noble appearance of the body as it lay upon the lawn, un- der those pleasant poplars; the regal brow, the se- rene expression, the appropriate costume ; the scat- tered groups of friends, and neighbors, and servants ; the long, orderly procession of mourners from all parts, almost, of the land; the simple rites, the trembling voice of the old priest, the pleasant, wea- ther-stained faces of the old farmers who bore him to the tomb; the feeling of true grief and affection- ate veneration, written upon all countenances; the leaves falling around us, the o'ercast sky, the plain- tive music of the sea; all, all combined to form a 4    1ii          SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      87 most impressive and memorable spectacle.

My dear Aristides, this prompt and courteous acceptance of my invitation, is indeed most gratifying. Allow me to make you acquainted with my venerated countryman, John Jay. Aris. Ah, I am charmed to see him. His name and fame have been long familiar to me. I wonder we have never met before. Jay. It is strange, considering the liberties we ghosts are allowed now-a-days. How different from the old regime! Then, we never used to think of showing ourselves till long after sun-down, you know; never got an invitation from any quarter, or a very cordial welcome, when we did venture to make a call. Now, we knock around, in broad day- light, in the most free and friendly style, and with- out the slightest regard to the unities.   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      91 Aris. Even so. This is the era of innovations of all sorts, all over the universe. None of the old- fashioned doctrines, either in manners or in morals, in science or in art, seem to be listened to any long- er. I am sorry to see it. The unities, indeed! Why, Judge, the idea of presenting a play to an Athenian audience, in my day, wherein there was the slightest violation of any one of them, would not have been tolerated for a moment. Such a per- formance would have been hissed at once from the stage, with indignation. You see how it is now; and, indeied, ever since that popular transgressor of all laws, Shakspeare, has come into being. Con- found the fellow, he flirts with all the nine Muses at once; is eternally laughing out of one eye, and cry- ing out of the other; and yet, somehow or other, the dog is so fascinating, so grand, so irresistible, that criticism is completely disarmed, nay, swallowed up in admiration. Sophocles himself, by the way, made the same remark to me, but an evening or two ago, in an adjoining luminary, while we were listening to that delicious play--The Merchant of Venice. Jay. Why, Aristides, you talk like a regular old theatre-goer. And are all you Greeks such enthu- siastic Shakspearians? Aris.

Is there a single theatre in any star in heaven, the manager of which would not be perfectly crazy to bring out his last play? W. the Elder. Ah, what is it? What does he call it         ; Aris. I don't know, indeed. I was merely speak- ing, my friend, at a venture; taking it for granted that he has got something magnificent ready for us. It is some time, now, since his Napoleon was pro- duced. W. the Elder. What, has he written a play on that theme? Aris. Yes, truly, a most sublime tragedy. Many critics consider it, especially the last act, his master- work. It certainly is in his happiest vein. I remem- ber nothing in Othello or Lear, more affecting than the dying speech of the imperial exile. But my friend, the Judge, here, may not be such a votary of the drama, as we Athenians are, and always have been. So, let's change the subject. Do tell us, Judge, where have you been keeping yourself all this time '!2 How is it that two such kindred spirits, and lovers of justice as ourselves, have not been brought together long ago?  Jay.

Indeed, the whole bench have been ?-   Sadly bothered and overworked, for some time past. Aris. What subjects have you been particularly investigating? Jay. Well, a great variety. The main items of annoyance, however, have grown out of certain new- fangled opinions, and absurd attempts at legislation, in our planet, on the subject of Female Ghosts' Rights. W. the Elder. Ah, there's been a good deal of stir on that topic, in these regions, of late. Jay. Indeed! There's certainly been a great deal of nonsense talked about it in Jupiter. Why, do you know, Aristides, they have actually been try- ing, not merely to bribe, but to overawe us Judges into finding authorities in the books, recognizing the competence of married ghostesses to enter into all sorts of contracts, as unreservedly as their hus- bands. One vixen actually had the impudence, the other day,' to try to recover damages on a time- transaction in a notorious fancy-stock; and when we most promptly and properly turned her out of court, her counsel, with audacity unparalleled, called me, the Chief Justice, in open court, a miserable old fogy. Of course, I committed him instanter.  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8093-00000047"/> "     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. Aris. The impertinent whelp! Why, these are new doctrines. Jay. But, my friend, we mean to be firm. We shall not yield an inch to any such insolence or ab- surdity. The, law is as clear as it is sound, on this subject; and we intend to expound and apply it, like honest ghosts. Yes, the good old-fashioned doctrine of the common law, founded on good sense and experience, and the best instincts of the heart. And we mean to do all we can, as spiritual citizens, to prevent the passage of any such unreasonable laws as have been suggested. I think and talk, now, on this point, precisely as I did in the flesh. Legislation for women, forsooth! As if the law of love were not the great law under which they ought aliketo govern and be governed! A pure, loving, gentle, patient woman, be she mother, wife, or daugh- -ter, why, what does she want at the hands of the lawgiver? Is she not already enthroned, by virtue of those very attributes, in our hearts? The idea, too, of turning one's wife into a mere partner in trade, or an independent property-holder, and of in- vading the sacred circle of home with the associa- tions and the bye-laws that belong to banks and counting houses! I have no patience with such doctrines. I have moreover noticed, my friend, throughout this whole movement, that the true spir- t   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.,      95 its, the model wives and mothers, that we all swear by, have not expressed the slightest sympathy with it; and I believe it can pretty much all be traced to a certain clique of shrill-voiced, turbulent, spectral blue-stockings; creatures, alas, from whom no planet or system is free. But you must forgive my warmth, Aristides. Am I, or am I not right on this matter? Aris. Certainly, certainly you are. At the same time, Judge, I must confess, as an honest ghost, that the women of Athens hardly had justice done them, in my day. I think they were unreasonably exclu- ded from many appropriate employments and amuse- ments, and that our Athenian society suffered ac- cordingly. I think there would have been less tur- bulence and misrule, far more refinement, and cer- tainly far more benevolent enterprises of all sorts, if they had had more of a voice in our social ar- rangements. Jay. I've no doubt of it, my friend, nor do I wish to be unreasonable on the subject. I am no ultraist. Aris. We all know that, Judge your reputation for calm wisdom, and moral courage, is pretty well established throughout the universe. W. the Elder. From what you said just now, Aristides, I infer that you had no Bloomers in Athens. Aris. Bloomers-Bloomers?

Females, who go about tasting the air in trowsers, and-under broad brims; and who oc- casionally mount a stray ash-barrel or. tree-stump, to enlighten the passers-by, on social and philo- sophical topics. Aris. Minerva be thanked, we knew no such crea- tures. And yet, on reflection, I can recall one or two such she-peripatetics; one, more particularly; a most clever woman, too, in her line; a capital chi- ropodist; in fact, the only bona fide corn-eradicator that I ever knew; all the rest have been sheer pre- tenders. But not satisfied with her laurels in this de- partment, she set up for a metaphysician and cos- mogonist, and would go about, every now and then, delivering a street lecture, such as you speak of. Poor thing, they had to lock her up at last. W. the Elder. May it please your Honor- Jay. Well, what is it, my eccentric friend ? W. the Elder. Pshaw! What an old fool I am, to be sure! I ask ten thousand pardons; but I really thought for a moment (so strong was the illu- sion), that-you were actually in the flesh again, and presiding over the Supreme Court of the United States. Ah, would it were so, indeed! Weshould   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      97   all feel safer, and the country would be in a much more comfortable condition. Jay. Don't talk so. From all I hear, I should say you had a capital bench of Judges, If the country is always as well served in that Depart- ment, there will be no ground for grumbling or anx- iety. W. the Elder. Well, I dare say it is so; but I was about, under the influence of said delusion, to ask your Honor's opinion as to the constitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Law, passed a year or two since. But of course you have not heard of it. Jay. Haven't I? Didn't I hear all about it, lately, from Henry Clay ? W. the Elder. (gives three cheers.) Aris. Why, what is the matter with the mortal? Jay. (aside to Aristides.) We must humor the old gentleman. He is, evidently, a very flighty, fanciful sort of genius. W. the Elder. You must forgive me, gentlemen; but such is my enthusiastic admiration of the patriot of whom the Judge spoke, that I have uniformly made it a rule, as well since as before his departure from earth, to pay the usual honors, whenever and wherever I hear his name mentioned; the sanctu- ary, of course, always excepted. But as to the law  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8093-00000049"/> 98      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. in question; you think it constitutional, do you, Judge? Jay. Well, so far as I could gather from Mr. Clay's statements and explanations, I should con- sider it not merely constitutional, but essential, nay, obligatory upon the nation. W. the Elder. Ah, how gratified I am at such an endorsement of my own humble opinions. There are those about us who sing a very different tune; who speak of the law in the most discourteous, disre- spectful manner; nay, who do not scruple to say that they would glory in disobeying it. Jay. So I was told. I am very sorry to hear it. What, glory in disobeying a law passed expressly to give effect to a solemn clause of the Constitution; passed after a most thorough investigation and searching debate, and duly promulgated to the na- tion as the will of the people? How do such doc- trines strike you, Aristides? Aris. Sheer heresy and treason, according to my old Athenian notions. Why, where would it land us? Was there ever a law passed, so wise or good, but what it trod on somebody's toes, interfered with the whims of some enthusiast, or thwarted the plans of some self-seekerl Such a doctrine, of course, turns all government into a farce.   i         .SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     99 W. the Elder. And yet it is broached very freely and frequently, all around us. f'   Jay. And I say again, I am sorry to hear it. ' I regret, too, to hear that there is so much ultraism and ill-feeling, in the country, on this slavery ques- tion; such an aggressive, Pharisaical spirit, in the North-such an unreasonable, vindictive temper in the South. It ought not to be, and, thank Heaven, it was not so in my day. What would have become of us, indeed, had we given way thus to our passions? We all felt and talked alike, on the subject, then , all admitted the evil of the institution ; at the same time, we saw the necessity of acting like true bro- thers, gentlemen, and Christians, in the matter; saw that a spirit of conciliation and forbearance was the indispensable preliminary to any hopeful attempt at mitigating or removing the mischief. Would that the same calm counsels could prevail now! Do, my dear host, for the few short years that remain to you as a mortal, do exert all your influence towards bringing about a spirit of brotherly love, upon this and all great national questions.

But, Aristides, this subject does not specially interest you. Aris. I beg your pardon. - It does interest me. I was a slave-holder myself, you know, on earth, though not to any great extent. I agree with you, Judge, entirely, in this matter. I am not, and never was, an apologist for slavery. No statute, human or spiritual, can justify it, or convert it into a blessing. At the same time, the evils of the system, as we know it in Athens, have been abominably ex- aggerated by mendacious historians. Jay. No doubt of it. An honest, even-tempered, self forgetting historian, is a very scarce article. Aris. Besides, Judge, I am not so badly posted up in American affairs, as you suppose. I have met a good many ghosts from your land, iin the course of my travels, and have invariably found them plea- sant and intelligent spirits; though never, till to- day, one so illustrious as yourself. Jay. If it was not Aristides who said this, I should accuse him of flattery. Aris. You know me too well for that. But go on; I like to hear you talk. Tell us all about these, glorious contemporaries of yours. Jay. Ah, I'm no talker.

W. the Elder. I regret to add, Judge, that your own Life and Writings are anything but profitable to the publishers. Jay. Well, after what I've just heard, I am not at all surprised at it. W. the Elder. 'Twas but a day or two ago, that a leading Broadway bookseller told me he would rather take 10,000 copies of Uncle Tom's Cabin, on a venture, than ten copies of the other. Jay. I dare say-I dare say. Aris. Why, this is positively more shabby and ungrateful than our own ostracism. But never' mind, Judge, never mind: the-truth is, the present generation of Americans is too near, to have a fair /.

Ah, dear, I wish I had been a member of that same illustrious convention of yours. 1 would willingly exchange all my Grecian laurels for an honor like that. Jay. You would have made an invaluable member, no doubt; and yet, you ought to be satisfied, Aris- tides. You did a world of good, in your day. You played your part right handsomely, and will be re- membered through all time, as the true patriot, the upright Judge. Indeed, I hardly know a pedestal in Fame's temple that I would rather stand on than yours. W. the Elder. Judge Jay-- Jay. Well, my friend, what is it 7 W. the Elder. Do you happen to have heard any- thing, from recently arrived ghosts, touching the Maine Liquor Law? If so, I should be glad to hear your views as to the propriety and policy of that statute. Jay.

So give me your address, and 'll telegraph you on the sub- ject. W. the Elder. Certainly-certainly ; or, suppose you drop me a line through the Shekineh. Jay. As you will; the cause is indeed a noble -one, mly friend, and has all my sympathies. At the same time, I have my misgivings as to the expe- diency of legislating on such subjects. What say you, brother magistrate? Ought we not rather to leave these matters to the Divine Lawgiver, and to the Court of Conscience? 'Aris. I am certainly inclined to that opinion. However, I have little knowledge on the subject, having been a cold water character from the start. We Greeks, you know, were never much given to bibbing. Will you believe it, Judge, I have never tasted a drop of ardent spirits in the whole course of my spiritual career? W. the Elder. Well, then, just for the novelty of the thing, Aristides, do me the favor to try a little rum that I've got-here, that I know has been in bot- tle for more than two centuries. It will do you good, I'm sure. Aris. No, no, my old friend, I am much obliged, to you; but its merits would be completely thrown away upon me. Besides, I do not care to form any such habit at this stage of my pilgrimage.   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      105 W. the Elder. Perhaps his Honor would- Jay. No, not for me. I do my work on water. It's bad enough for the lawyers to knock their glasses together, as they do, continually; but a groggery Bench is, of all things, my horror. Well, friends, I'm afraid I shall have to move an adjourn- ment of this meeting. I must be back to my books. W. the Elder. Oh, Judge, don't leave us so ab- ruptly. Do stop to dinner, at least. Jay. I would, with pleasure, my dear host, but the thing is quite out of the question to-day. W. the Elder. Well, Aristides, you will, I'm sure. Aris. With great pleasure. In fact, I came with the expectation of spending both day and evening with you.  Pray, what are the entertainments about town, for to-niaht? W. the Elder. There's the paper; see for your- self. Aris.

We'll start early, too, and stop in at Hope Chapel, for a fippenny-bit's worth of Woman's Rights, on our way down. We can do both, and still have timne enough for friend Wallack's comedietta.

I was about saying, my dear doctor, that [ I had just been reading your discourse on self-cul- a ture.  Charn. Indeed! You liked it, I hope.   ! Chrys. Liked it? I lack words to express my admiration of it. Whether I consider the laudable object you had in view, the grand theme itself, your manner of unfolding it, your earnestness of purpose, your vigor of expression, your fertility of illustration, or your beautifully limpid style-in every point of view. in fact, am I constrained to give it my un- qualified approbation. Do you know, doctor, I am far better pleased with it than with those of your earlier productions that I have seen; such as the Review of Milton, and of Fenelon, and your Thoughts on Napoleon; not the speak of some of your youth-  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC8093-00000054"/> 108     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. ful and (excuse me for saying so) somewhat mystical and transcendental sermons. It seems to me to have far more heart and pith about it, more directness and energy, less of self-consciousness, less attempt at building up stately sentences, less arraying of your thoughts in purple and fine linen; ina word, I think it far more to the purpose in every way. Yes, I re- peat it, a most charming, admirable performance. Dearly as I love my own Greek tongue, partial as I am to the homilies of my old brother patriarchs, I must acknowledge that there is nothing in them all to excel, if rival it. Chan. Such warmth of language, from so ortho- dox a quarter, I confess, somewhat surprises me. Chyrs. I see it does. But, my dear friend, ought it not to be all the more genuine and acceptable on that very account? Chan. True, true. And yet, brother Chrysostom, tell me now, candidly; had we been contemporaries, would you not have been among the very first to have burned the discourse in question, and the others to which you allude, and, in all probability, the writer'along with them? Chzrys. -Alas for humanity! what you say, dear doctor, is, I fear, quite too true. I certainly teas, to my discredit be it spoken, a most prominent and conspicuous persecutor of heretics, in my day; and   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     109 you, as one of the most fascinating and dangerous of them, would of course have been correspondingly obnoxious. And even now, my friend, while thus cheerfully paying my tribute of admiration to your genius and your goodness, I must say I think you terribly off the track in your Theology; and your writings, admired and circulated through the world as they are, and ever must be, are more and. more tending to unsettle the opinions of the planet, in what I must consider vital, essential points of faith. I speak plainly, you see. Chan. I like you all the better for- that. But, Chrlysostom, have we not both had ample occasion alike to modify and enlarge our theological views, since leaving earth? Chrys. Indeed, indeed we have. But we forget, we may not dwell on themes like these in the pres- ence of mortals. Besides, our old friend here could neither comprehend, nor report us aright to his brethren. W. the Elder preserveth a judicious silence.) Chrys. And so, forgetting that we are disem bodied spirits, and looking at these topics, once more, through our old terrestrial spectacles, allow me, my dear Channing, to continue my criticism on this same Address of yours, by saying, that from beginning to end of it you (at least in my humble  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC8093-00000055"/> "O     SPIRITUAL VISITORS, opinion) were firing over the heads of your audi- ence. Chan. How so? Chrys. I mean in assuming the existence in them, and in the masses generally, of such capaci- ties and aspirations as you did, and in predicting such glorious prospects ahead, for the planet. I don't believe in either, myself. I think neither rea- son nor experience justifies any such assumptions or expectations. I think the multitude are to-day what they ever have been and must be on earth, hewers of wood and drawers of water; that the self- culture you speak of, is now and ever must be the portion of the few, -while rough toil and rude igno- rance are God's own appointed destiny for the many; in a word, that the beautiful picture which you have there drawn of humanity, exists only in your own ardent imagination. Chan. Not so, not so, Chrysostom. On the con- trary, I believe I have quite understated the matter, in the Discourse in question; that I have not done justice to my subject, have not begun to appreciate aright the magnificent future in store for earth. What I have this day seen, convinces me of it all the more. Never, my friend, were the prospects of the world so brilliant as now. I believe that if we could have access to all the records of the race, that   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     1" have been kept in heaven from the beginning up to this hour, and had the power and patience faithfully to collate them, we should find a most palpable and hopeful progress, in all that appertains unto Art, and Morals, and Faith. Just as certainly as I be- lieve that there are more acres under cultivation, to-day, than ever before, more ships upon the sea, more knowledge of all the kingdoms of nature, more wits trained and developed for the multiplied busi- ness of life, so do I believe that there are far more hearts than ever, ready for the reception of spiritual truth, more consciences alive to the great realities of God's precious word. Especially do I beliere that the wonderful discoveries in physical science of the last half century, and the corresponding power of multiplying and circulating invaluable truths all over the globe, are to be potent instruments for ac- celerating the advent of that blessed future that I see so clearly ahead; and that the day may not be so very far distant as some of us suppose, when this dear earth of ours, already so conspicuous among her sister stars, for her beauty and lustre, will be still more conspicuous as the abode of intelligent and virtuous souls. There must be long and ardu- ous conflicts first, I know; many the pains and scars of strife; but that the good will triumph at last, that peace and love and faith will prevail over  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC8093-00000056"/> "2     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. their enemies, I have no more doubt of than I doubt that those are the rays of the blessed sun, that are shining in on us so graciously. Oh! no, Chrysos- tom, I cannot agree with you. The more I reflect upon the wonderful capabilities of human nature, and the God-like tasks it is yet destined to achieve on this same earth, our honored birth-place, the more do I feel the inadequacy of language to do jus- tice to themes so glorious. Chrys. I admire this beautiful enthusiasm of yours, my friend. Would that I could see with your eyes; but I cannot; I cannot find the facts whereon to build such eulogies or hopes. I come back to earth from my spiritual wanderings, and what do I behold? No such gratifying omens as you describe; no, no; on the contrary, I find the children of men playing the fool and knave just as madly and eagerly, to-day, as when I first preached to them in Antioch or Constantinople; I see the same corruption and intrigues in Church and State, the same insane thirst for gold and pleasure, the same temporary yielding to good impulses, the same permanent de- votion to bad passions-in short, the same old thea- tre and actors as ever, with a few slight modifica- tions in scenery and costumes; the same paucity of stars, the same crowd of stupid supernumeraries. Then, as now, if an eloquent divine, like- yourself,   I      SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     113 came along, the people ran after him, and seemed to be impressed with his teachings. I, myself (and I may say it without conceit, as the most famous pul- pit orator of my time), have brought tears to myri- ads of eyes, have brought many a hardened sinner to his knees; but after all, what did it amount to? Hardly was the benediction pronounced, the flock dismissed, before these same guilt-oppressed crea- tures forgot alike my lessons and their fears, and were soon immersed again, deep as ever, in the per- ishing things and cares of earth; heaven and its joys, hell and its woes, forgotten quite till the next Sabbath, when the same stimulus was again applied, the same nervous excitement (for was it anything better?) again produced. Harsh and painful as this sounds, I yet appeal to your own experience, as a preacher, if it be not too true. /Chan. I must confess that I have been much pained and grieved, at times, to see the frightful ra- pidity with which my people, after service, have reverted to the topics of cotton and sugar, the last ball, or the coming election. I have noticed, too, that when I have been particularly pointed and per- sonal in my appeals, there has been a corresponding degree of eagerness to escape from the subject. I certainly have been, more than once, greatly morti- fied and discouraged in consequence. At the same  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC8093-00000057"/> "4     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. time, my friend, I have often found afterwards, that the impression made by my remarks, was far more deep and lasting than I had at first supposed; in a word, that I had prejudged my parishioners, and that the good seed which I thought had perished by the wayside, had brought forth precious fruit; made manifest not only in the hours of sickness and sor- row, but in the midst. of the active duties of life. And then again, my friend, I. remembered that we men of New England never were so demonstrative as you of Greece and Rome, and were unwilling to betray even to ourselves the depths of our emotions. On the whole, Chrysostomj so far from sympathizing with you, on this point, I must say that I look back on my earthly career as a pastor, with all its cares and drawhacks, as a pleasant and profitable one. I feel that I did some good in my day and generation, and I think I can perceive already (I speak it in no spirit of-self-complacency), the beneficial effects of my ministry, in my ever-loved town of Boston. Nay,throughout the land, I see everything to encour- age and animate the divine and the philanthropist. I see a growing regard for religion, a growing indiffer- ence to unimportant matters of doctrine and discipline, and a corresponding reverence for the grand, simple truths that lie at the bottom of our common faith. In a word, I see everywhere, good and cheering symp-    iis       SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      115 toms for humanity; a good time coming; a season of peace, and knowledge, and virtue. I see every- thing to stimulate all worthy men, in the-pulpit and out of the pulpit, to renewed labors of love towards their brethren. Chrys. Ever cheerful, ever hopeful! Ah! doc- tor, I wish I had a little more of your zealous, san- guine nature; and, indeed, I had, when in the flesh; but somehow or other it seems to have left me. Why multiply words, however? We shall never agree, I fear, either in our observations or our con- elusions upon these points. ChsC/tal. I fear not, any more than upon those other far more subtle and far less important matters of theological speculation, to which you before alluded; and so let's e'en change the theme. Come, tell us, brother Chrysostom, where are you last from, and what have you been engaged in recently? Chrys. I am just from the Vatican. Charin. Indeed! Chrys. Yes, I have been spending a few days with my friend, Pius IX. Chlln. And how is the old gentleman, und what sort of a person may he be? There are so many conflicting statements and rumors about him, that I am anxious to have your opinion. Chrys. Well, from what I have seen of him, I  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC8093-00000058"/> "6     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. should say he was an exceedingly amiable, well dis- posed man. Could he have his way, every mother's son and daughter of earth would be well and happy this very hour; but, between ourselves, he is not the hero, appointed of heaven, to bring about any such blessed consummation. He has neither the strength of intellect nor the moral courage for the task. As a companion, it would be hard to find one more cour- teous and agreeable; no great scholar, by the way; far inferior in that respect to his predecessor. Gregory XVI. On the whole, a very worthy and very commonplace old soul. Chan. Such was my impression. Ah! Chrysos- tom, what an opening there was for a man of the right stamp! Had brother Luther had another such chance, now, what glorious reforms he would have inaugurated! How he. would have made the world ring with his words of power and wisdom! Chrys. I doubt it. In all probability some assas- sin's knife would have laid him low, long ere this; still, it is none the less true, that brother Pius was, and is, quite unequal to his position. Poor man! he raised a tempest that he could not control ; in an evil hour he took counsel of his fears, threw up his part, sought refuge in a ruffian's court, and will' henceforth, for all his good intentions, be remem-   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      117 bered as one of the least significant of the whole catalogue of Popes.  Chan., A catalogue, by the way, that seems fast drawing to a close. Chrys. It looks so, certainly. Chan. But is it true, my friend, that he intends to demean himself so far as to go and give his crown and blessing to the miserable usurper who is now trifling with the destinies of France? Chrys., Even so. He told me this very day, that he intended to take a trip to Paris, in the course of the summer, for that express purpose. Chan. I am sorry to hear it, Couldn't he man- age to excuse himself from this degrading ceremony on the score of ill health? Chrys. Hardly, though his health is none of the best. No, no, he dare not refuse, if he would. Italy would be too hot for him. Besides, the arrange- ments are already completed, and every hotel-keeper and balcony owner in Paris and on the road, would rebel, if there were any change of programme. It is so written in the book of destiny; and as his rev- erend namesake crowned Napoleon the Great, so it is reserved for him to place the bauble on the brow of Napoleon the Little. Chan. Yes, but there was some shadow of excuse in the first case, for the uncle, villain and cut-throat  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC8093-00000059"/> "8      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. that he was, had yet something magnificent and im- perial about him; but this shallow imitator, This slave, that is not twentieth part the tythe Of the precedent lord; this vice of kings; This cut-purse of the empire and the rule; this- Chrys. Why, doctor, you are getting warm. Chan. Well, I confess, my friend, it does move my indignation, as a true republican, and lover of my race, to see this pitiful mummer carry it off thus triumphantly; to see a great nation bowing its neck to the yoke of such a wretch, without a struggle. Chrys. Pray, doctor, how do you reconcile the phenomenon that France is now presenting to the world with your theory of Progress? I see very faint traces of self-culture, myself, in the recent events there. Chan. Too true, Chrysostom, too true.- They seem to be taking the back track, in a way alike dis- couraging and disgraceful. Fie upon these same capitalists and pleasure-seekers of Paris! I have no patience with them for thus preferringan ignoble, servile tranquillity, to the duties and privileges of freemen. And yet, my friend, when I survey, not any one province or kingdom of the earth, but the whole blessed ball itself, I still cling fast to my opin-   X,;H        SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     119 ions, still see ample ground for hope, and for believ- ing in the ultimate triumph of liberty and of truth. Nil desperanduitm, Christo duce. Hope on, hope ever; my motto on earth, my motto in all worlds. Chrys. Well, well, I have not troubled my head much about earthly politics, during my present visit, nor do I intend to. By the way, doctor, what a de- cidedly substantial and roomy place of worship our friend Pius has, alongside of his palace. He tells me that he can seat ninety thousand very comforta- bly. You have no such extensive accommodations as yet in America, I believe? Chan. No, not a cathedral worthy of the name. But surely you had seen St. Peters before? Chrys. Not since it was finished. What a bril- liant piece of work, to be sure! Ah, dear, we managed these things very differently in the days of my earth- ly ministry. And the Pagans themselves had no- thing to show like this. Even the Parthenon was a mere baby-house in comparison. Chan. It is, indeed, a magnificent creation of genius. Any planet might be proud of it. Chrys. Do you know, doctor, that the finest poeti- cal description of it, by all odds, that I have ever met with, is that of your own Byron? Chan. Admirable, admirable.  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC8093-00000060"/> 120      SPIRITUAL VISITORS.  "But lo, the dome, the vast and wondrous dome, To which Diana's marvel was a cell-" Ah, I've lost it. I used to know it by heart. Let's see, how does it run? (After a slight pause, the doctor remembers and repeats the passage.) Chrys. Thank you, thank you, my dear friend. Most charmingly -recited, too. I don't wonder that you drew crowds, doctor, in your day. Chan. All Byton's descriptions, by the way, of the memorable objects in and about Rome, seem tome to be alike graphic and felicitous. Chrys. And yet we are told, nay, he himself told me but recently, that he had only spent a week of his terrestrial life there. Chanr. Such is the all-grasping, all-penetratincg power of genius. Every cultivated traveler in Italy to-day, is looking through Harold's eyes at its won- ders and relics; and it will be so, no doubt, while one stone stands upon another. Poor Byron, had he been as wise and good as he was brilliant, what a career would have been his! Oh, how could he have been so infatuated, thus madly to court dishonor and sorrow, and an untimely grave, when he might have been enjoying a glorious old age this' very hour, building the lofty rhyme, and winning a, name, only -second to that of dear Milton himself:   SPIRITUAL  VISITORS.     121 Chrys. Too true, too true. And yet, my friend, after all, what signify to us immortals a few short years, more or less, of earthly pilgrimage, a few blasts, fainter or louder, of earthly fame 2 What a vapor is it, after all! As you yourself remarked, in your last homily, an unaccusing conscience, howe'er the world may overlook or slight it, is better far than all the chaplets ever woven by beauty, all the odes ever chanted by poets. By the way, doctor, allow me, in this connection, to repeat, in return for your verses, a passage that I ran against recently, the beauty and force of which so impressed me, that I conimitted it to- memory.  Perhaps you may have heard it before. It is a description of what the wri- ter considers true greatness. "'The greatest man is he who chooses the right with invincible resolu- tion, who resists the sorest temptations from within and without, who bears the heaviest burdens cheer- fiully, who is calmest in storms and most fearless un- der menace and frowns, whose reliance on truth, on virtue, on God, is most unfaltering; and is- this a greatness which is apt to make a. show, or which is most likely to abound in conspicuous station? The solemn conflicts of reason with passion, the victories of moral and religious principle over urgent and al- most irresistible  solicitations to self-indulgence, the  hardest  sacrifices of duty, those of deep- seated affection, and of the heart's fondest hopes, the  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC8093-00000061"/> 122     SPIRITUAL VISITORS consolations, hopes, joys and peace of disappoint- ed, persecuted, scorned, deserted virtue; these are, of course, unseen: so that the true greatness of hu- man life, is almost wholly out of sight." There, if you'll show me any thing grander than that, in Plato or Jeremy Taylor, I should like to see it. Chan. Why, Chrysostom, unless I greatly err, these are my own words, and in that very discourse of which you have been pleased to speak so kindly. Chrys. To be sure they are, my dear friend. Chan. This is really very gratifying, this par- tiality of yours ; but I must stay no longer to listen to your compliments. My thesis is waiting for me. Chrys. Ah, and where do you preach the coming Sabbath-? Chan. For brother Augustine. And youl? Chrys. I hardly know as yet. I shall probably, however, exchange stars and pulpits with brother Massillon. But I amf sorry you are going, doctor. I have a world of things to say to you. W. the Elder. And so am I, gentlemen. I don't have company like this every day, I can assure you. Chan. Some other time, friends, some other time. Chrys. Well, if it must be so, I'll e'en go and look after my own sermon. So, farewell, dear bro- ther; farewell, my worthy terrestrial friend. W. the Elder. Heaven be with you. (Exeunt.)   (,!?    .SPIRITUAL VISITORS.          123 W. the Elder. Venerated troubadour, this is an honor, indeed! Allow me to present to you, your brother-minstrel Bellini.  Amp. No occasion for so much ceremony, old gen- tleman. We are acquaintances of long standing, al- ready. W the Elder. Indeed! Amp. To be sure; in fact, ever since he left Paris. By the way, brother B. I saw you at the lecture, last night. How were you pleased? Bel. Very much. I liked both the man and his remarks. Didn't you? Amp. I certainly did. Especially was I gratified at the manly, independent way, in which he vindi- cated the dignity of Art. Mock modesty and affec- tation are so common on these occasions, that it is &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8093-00000062"/> SPIRITUAL VISITORS,  really quite refreshing to hear a little home-truth told with such evident heartiness and good faith as he manifested. Some of his sentences, too, struck me as being very felicitous, both as to thought and style. Bel. What pleased me most, was the unpretend- ing but admirable way in which he illustrated his remarks, with voice and piano.' W. the Elder. Ho, ho! And so you were both at brother Fry's, last night. I was in that crowd, myself. Amp. Crowd, say you! It ought to have been a crowd. It don't speak much for the taste of you Gothamites, to allow such a treat to be presented to a hall only half-filled. W. the Elder. But, my friend, you forget what an immense room it is; to say nothing of the host of counter attractions, that Amp. No excuse, no excuse, Had such a lecture, so illhstrated, been delivered in Thebes, even in my day, we should have turned out in full force. Bel. Perhaps our terrestrial friend was not so much impressed as ourselves. I should like to hear your verdict, my good host, on the performance. W. the Elder. Well, to tell the truth, I didn't hear more than a fifth part of the lecture.   Amp. Ah, just as I supposed. You merely came to have your ears tickled with the music. W. the Elder. I beg your pardon. I was among the very first on the ground, and had a capital seat. But a young lady and gentleman, immediately be- fore me, talked so very loud, and indulged in so many brilliant criticisms upon the bonnets and com- plexions present, that I was quite defrauded of those of the lecturer. Amp. Why, you surprise me. It certainly seem- ed to me, as I looked down upon it, from the first circle, to be an exceedingly well-bred and refined-look- ing assemblage. W. the Elder. I dare say. Well, well, such things are no novelties in our American audiences. It is very seldom that I can listen, either to song, speech or sermon, with any comfort. There are so many impertinent interruptions, so much absurd and ill-timed applause with rattans and umbrellas, so many rude boys knocking about in the galleries with heavy-heeled boots, such a rush for the door, before the cavatina, or even the benediction, is finished, in short, so much indecent behavior of all sorts, that I get quite. out of patience, at times. Such outrages wouldn't be tolerated a moment in Paris or London.

Bel. My friend, I think you are rather severe upon your countrymen. But surely, you liked 'the singing. W. the Elder. Oh, charming, charming. Rose de Vries's rendering of the bolero, from Leonora, was perfectly delicious. Bel. And the music was worthy of the artist. Do you know, that I was very much surprised, after listening to such- a specimen of it, to hear my neigh- bor say, that the opera in question, had been a com- plete failure? W. the Elder. Failure?  A  most abominable misrepresentation. On the contrary, it was a signal success. But he tookt his cue, no doubt, from a statement to that effect, in one of our morning pa- pers, a few days since. I saw the article, myself. It's disingenuousness was only equalled by its flip- pancy and conceit. Bel. Well, I am glad to hear you say so; for I was thinking, at the time, that I should be very willing to have my name and fame identified with such a composition ; and so, no doubt, would brother Amphion here, for all his laurels. Amp. Yes, indeed. W. the Elder. Well, under favor, Amphion, I   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     127 don't think that, any very great compliment, myself; i. e., if the specimens which the lecturer gave us, of Grecian music, were genuine ones. They certainly seemed to me, far more calculated to disperse, than to draw crowds. How is it? Didn't he misrepre- sent you Thebans, somewhat, in this matter?- Were those the bona fide strains of your day, or have we not yet got the hang of your notation? Be so good as to shed a little light on the subject. Amp. I must confess that the specimens in ques- tion were frightfully near the truth. Otur melodies were very different from friend Bellini's here. En- tre nots, what little music I have picked up in my time, has been in other planets. The art was in a most aboriginal condition when I sang and twangled my lyre, in Bceotia. Our tunes were hardly fit to slaugtter hogs to, much less to accompany love- songs. Our greatest artists were those who could blow loudest and longest. Nine-tenths of the instru- ments in our orchestras, were instruments of per- cussion. W. the Elder. What a sweet effect it must have produced! Amnp. To be first gong, in my time, Nwas as great an honor as to be first fiddle now; and the man who could handle the cymbals effectively, was pretty sure of an invitation to dinner, wherever he might be.  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC8093-00000064"/> 128     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. W. the Elder. Gongs and dinners are very apt to go together in our day. Bel. In that connexion the instrument is not so bad; but it certainly is not the first I should select as the companion of my solitude, or the soother of my sorrows.    .        - Amp. In truth, my dear friend, let me say, with- out going into-any tedious details, that I have been alike surprised and delighted at the progress you mortals have made in the divine art since I was in the body, WT. the Elder. But how, in Euterpe's name, is it, Amphion, that you have got such a world-wide and lofty name amongst the children of men? We boys, you know, are accustomed to look up to you and Or- pheus, and one or two others, as the great founders of song, the darlings of the Muses; the men who fascinated the very rivers away from their b'eds; who made the forests march after you in stately procession; who set the hills and mountains them- selves dancing quadrilles and polkas, at your plea- sure! Amp. Ah, my friend, that's a matter that you and father Time must settle between yourselves. I am not responsible for his fibs, you know. But, Bellini, what became of you after the lecture? I stood in the corridor there, for nearly fifteen minutes,   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     -129 rap-rap-rapping with my ghostly knuckles, but I     you would not condescend to answer me. Bel. I was summoned away to sup with some dear friends in Union Place. Where did you go . Amop. I stopped in a few moments at the Broad- way Theatre, on my way down to the Irving. Bel. What- were they performing? Amp. The last scene of your own Sonnambula. Bel. Ah, true. And, pray, how do you like Al- boni  Amp. I was delighted, of course. There were one or two little things, perhaps, that' might have been mended. A little more pathos in the passages, just before waking, would have suited me better. Bel. [aside.] She certainly is rather too round and jolly for tragedy. Amp. That trill, too, of hers-full, strong, clear, sparkling as it was, beating anything I ever heard before in earthly bird or female-nevertheless seem- ed rather inappropriate in a prayer. Still-these were mere spots upon the sun. As a whole, it was a most charming version. You yourself would have been delighted with it, I am sure. Bel. You prefer her to Sontag, then? Amp. No, I don't say that. Each is delightful in her way. Alboni certainly has the advantage in youth and strength, and in the rare quality of her  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC8093-00000065"/> 130     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. voice; but as to method and culture, and personal attractions, most of the critics agree in conceding the palm to her rival. So, at least, a mortal told me the other'.evening; at Niblo's. Bel. There is quite a musical war going on in the town, they say, as to their merits. Amp. I was sorry to hear it. Art is too sacred a thing to be thus made the theme of partizan war- fare. Besides, the combatants, while they do no good to their cause, are only defrauding themselves of a great deal of genuine enjoyment, in giving way thus to their prejudices. Prejudices in art, indeed! I have no patience with them, any more than I have in religion. What, if I find a good, warm, generous -heart in a neighbor, am I to stop to count the arti- cles of the creed he follows, before hailing its owner as a brother? No, no. And by the same rule, if I hear a good song, grandly sung, shall I not make the most of it, and applaud it, without stopping to inquire what particular planet or system it hails from? Out upon such narrow-mindedness, say I  Bel. Spoken like the honest, old-fashioned musical ghost that you are. Amp. But, confound it, Bellini, those Sonnambula tunes of yours were running in my head all night. Where did you pick up those spirit-haunting melo- dies?  Do you know, I think that decidedly the finest of your earthly works.   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     131 W. the Elder. What, finer than Norma?-- Heresy, heresy Bel. You're certainly wrong there, Amphion. Amp. Well, I supposed you would impeach my taste for the assertion. And yet, somehow or other, I am always more impressed by the other. Yes, that simple story of rustic love and grief; of truth and innocence, for a while cast down, only to triumph more sweetly at last-that old story, old as earth, to which every spectre-haunted village of every land hath borne witness from the beginning-never, never, till your day, was it wedded to such delicious strains. At least so it seems to me. It always goes right home to my old ghostly heart, I know. It takes me back to my early days, when I wan- dered, boy and lover that I was, among the groves of Beootia, listening to the singing of the birds and the gurgling of the brooks, and weaving posies for my true-love.' And while birds sing, and brooks gurgle, and roses bloom, and hearts throb, will these same melodies of yours, my friend, be heard with rapture by mortals? Ah, Bellini, you were a lucky dog for being born when you were; when art could so multiply and scatter your sweet notes all over the planet. How different my destiny! I have, to be sure, a certain sort of traditionary and menda- cious fame, as my old friend here, said just now;  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC8093-00000066"/> 132      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. and I confess it is rather flattering to my ghostly vanity.  ]But, after all, what signifies it? What record have I left behind me? What song of mine is any human being singing this hour .? Not a line, not a note survives; while yours, where are they not heard? What highway or byeway of the world is not familiar with them? In the palaces of kings, the saloons of jewelled dames, in- every serenade of every city, out in the mid-ocean, under the gentle moonlight, and along the borders of the obscurest ; streams-everywhere, everywhere are they welcome guests; and will be, my friend, while the old ball- spins through space. -W. the Elder. Yes, indeed. "Long as a moonbeam glimmers, Or bosom sighs a vow; Long as the wood-leaves rustle, To cool a- weary brow; As long as roses blossom, And earth is green in May; As long as eyes shall sparkle, And smile in pleasure's ray; As long as cypress shadows 'The graves more mournful make, Or one cheek's wet with weeping, Or one poor heart can break ;" so long will brother B.'s melodies be heard on earth.   SPIRIT UAL VISITORS.     133 Bel. Really, my dear friends, I am quite over- whelmed by the warmth of your language. It is far above my humble merits. Amp. Not at all. We mean just what we say. But, my worthy host, where did you pick up those beautiful verses? Or are they of your own making? W. the Elder. Mine  No, indeed., I saw them in a paper a day or two since. They are part of a translation from the German, by a Boston friend of mine. -He writes very sweet ones of his own, but has a particular penchant, when he stum- bles over an exotic like this, to put it into English, for the benefit of his unlettered brethren. By the way, I saw in that same journal, if I mistake not, a discussion upon a point on which I should very much like, Amphion, to hear your views. Amp. Ah, what is it? W. the Elder. Simply this. Does the gradation in the scale of human intellect proceed from tone to color, or vice versa? Amrp. Howls that? How's that? W. the Elder. In other words, do you, with Oer- sted, class the visual sense above every other, and regard it as the recipient of man's highest percep- tions, or do you, with Schilling, give melody the precedence, and consider it the highest exponent of those same perceptions?  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC8093-00000067"/> 134      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. Amp. Well, as a musician, my prepossessions are, of course, with Schilling. As a ghost of truth, however, I am bound to tell you that Oersted is right. But, my old friend, why do you trouble your head, at your time of life, with such subtleties as these? As if you mortals, too, could arrive at any valuable, satisfactory knowledge on such points! You are on the wrong side of the grave, my dear boy, for any such discussions. Better let them alone. Leave them to your hair-splitting, meta- physical German brethren. Stick to your good, old-fashioned, practical English notions. You'll have to find out these mysteries, willy-nilly, before long. I might- if I saw fit, make some most start- ling disclosures to you on these and kindred sub- jects; but it would be neither becoming nor right in me, nor would it be for your own good. Such statements would only tease and excite you, and keep you awake; in a word, would quite unfit you for your appropriate duties and enjoyments here below. W. the Elder. You decline any investigation of the subject, then, do you?         I Amp. Emphatically, I do. W. the Elder. Well, perhaps you're right. All I got, I confess, by puzzling over the articles allu- *.    SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     135 ded to, was a hot, throbbing brain, and little or no light. Amp. And what better evidence could you have that you were wandering in forbidden paths? Take my advice, old friend, and abstain from all such spec- ulations, unless you wish to spend the remnant of your days in an asylum. Bel. Well, friends, I must be going. W. the Elder. Why in such haste? Bel. There is a choir of spirits waiting for me this very moment. I promised to meet them at re- hearsal. W. the Elder. What, a new opera on the tapis? Bel. No, no. It is in reference to a hymn that I have just finished, and the composition of which, I assure you, has cost me no little labor. There is a diminuendo passage in it that I am particularly anx- ious about, and I wish to give my young friends some suggestions on the subject. And so, addio, amici. Amp. Wait a moment, Bellini, and I'll go with you. W. the Elder. Amphion. Amp. Well? W. the Elder. I have a little favor to ask of you. I hope you'll not think my request an unreasonable one.  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC8093-00000068"/> 136     SPIRITUAL 'VISITORS. Amp. If it be at all practicable, my friend, I shall be proud to grant it. Let's hear it. W. the Elder. First,.then, let me tell you that I am the owner of property in the city of Thebes. Amp. What, my old head-quarters? The deuce you are-! You must be doing, a large business, to hold real estate so far from home. W. the Elder. Hear me through, if you please. I-.am now speaking, not of the Egyptian, or the Boeotian city, but of their namesake on, or rather under, the banks of the great Father of Waters. Amp. Well, how am I interested in that fact? W. the Elder. Have a moment's patience, my friend. The property in question, represented to me as a series of most eligible building lots, and hav- ing, indeed, a most cheerful and desirable aspect on the prettily colored map, from which I purchased it, has, nevertheless, one very bad feature about it. Amp. And what may that be? W. the Elder. Well, as I have already intimated, both it, and the adjacent Exchange, University, and Cathedral sites, have got into an awkward way of staying under water ninety-nine hundredths of their time. Amp. That certainly is rather, an unpleasant feature in real estate. But what good can I do in othe premises?   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     137 W. the Elder. What good? Why, how dull you are, Amphion! I want you to apply your old fash- ioned remedy for such complaints ; to take that same magic lyre of yours, to the melody of which, so many walls, and towers, and domes, and temples have risen, of yore, like exhalations, and proceed with it to the aforesaid property, and see if you can- not, by virtue of your sweet music, recall it to a sense of duty. I do not ask you to rear upon it a ifac simile of your own city, which would, of course, be out of place there; or even to put up a smart Western town on it; but simply to bring the land itself to the surface, and induce it, if you can, to re- main high and dry, the year round, and so quietly come into market, and attract the attention of capi- talists. Will you gratify me in this? Say you -will, my dear fellow, and thus make, at once, your friend's heart lighter, and his porte-monnaie heavier. Amp. I will, old boy--I will. Give me the direc- tions, and I'll go to the spot instanter. Let me ask one little favor first, however, before taking my de- parture. W. the Elder. Name it-name it. Amp. Will you have the goodness to sing or whistle for me the national air of your country? It may be of signal service to me, on, this expedition. Besides, I am curious to hear it, on other accounts.

Most cheerfully. But, mv friend, you must know that there are two or three claimants for that honor. -Of course, you would prefer to hear that which the people recognize most promptly, and applaud most tumultuously.

Why, do you know, Roscius, that with the solitary exception of that brief and somewhat for- mal interview at Brother Fletcher's, this is the first time that I have had your ghostly hand in mine? Ros. Even so, Well, well, here we are at last. We might be in worse quarters, too, than this quaint, cheerful, little library of our host here. W. the Elder.

Ah, John, we had very little such declamation as that in my time; and certainly, no such writing. Hamlet was your crack part, here below, was it not? Kem. So the public said. I myself preferred my Cato. But what was yours, Roscius? W. the Elder. Ah, yes, do tell us all about it. Ros.

Pray, what makes you look so astonished? W. the Elder. I ask your pardon, Roscius, but I certainly did have a vague impression, that the ladies didn't go to the theatre, in your day. Ros. Poh, poh; what put such an absurd notion as that in your head? W. the Elder. Well, there are pretty strong au- thorities leaning that way. Festus, Suidas, Hesy- chius. Eusebius, Heinsius, Bentley, Porson, Parr, Cleveland, Adams, Anthon- Ros. Pshaw, what do I care for a string of names? You might go on, in this way, till you had filled a metropolitan directory: that wouldn't alter the fact, you know. The idea of keeping strong-minded females away from the play-house, in any star, or era! Ridiculous! We had any quantity of them, both before and behind the scenes. W. the Elder.

Ros. It only shows you, my New England friend, what a mass of worthless fibs and conjectures all classical learning is. It was just so when I was a boy. Our school-books were full of the same abomi- nable mis-statements, about the manners and cus- toms of the Egyptians; and, no doubt, when Moses was a youngsters the Egyptian scholars swallowed just such thumpers relative to the social arrange- ments of the Chaldeans. W. the Elder. I dare say. Meanwhile, I feel very much like throwing that infernal Lempriere into the street, for misleading me in this atrocious manner. Kem. Oh, don't be so absurdly flighty and im- pulsive. My dear Roscius, go on with your: narra- tive. You were about telling us of some of your favorite personations. I confess, I am quite curious on the subject. Ros. Well, I was going to say, that I was most sure of crowding the house, in the- Elder Brutus, in Ennius's Last of the Tarquins. Not that it was his best play, or my best part, by any means, though there were some stirring passages in it about liberty ; but the theme itself always went right home to the hearts of the people. As a work of art, I was far prouder of my Numa, in a play of that name, written by my dearly beloved and ever-illustrious   SPIRITUAL VISITORS. .    148 pupil, Cicero. It never drew like the other, though, and indeed, was somewhat deficient in exciting in- cidents ; but it was full of lofty sentiments, put into the most exquisite verse. My Coriolanus, too, used to be cried up vastly, by a certain clique, though the public generally did not relish it much. The fact is, Pacuvius did not do himself or his hero justice on that occasion, and his play is not to be mentioned in the same universe with its Shaksperian namesake. Kemn. I should think not. What a play, what a play! Ros. And what laurels you won in it! Kem,. Ah, my dear Roscius, you are now touch- ing a tender chord. Do you know, that was my last part, on earth, and under what circumstances of mingled pride and sorrow, I performed it? Oh, with what painful vividness does the scene rise up before me, even now! Ros. I am really very sorry, my dear friend, that I should have called up any such unpleasant asso- ciations. Forgive- Kemn. Not at all, not at all. Go on with your story. Ros. Well, I was just about cutting it short, by saying, that on the whole, my cheval de bataille was Elpaminondas, in Ennius's masterpiece, so called. That last scene, where the hero perishes so glorious-  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC8093-00000072"/> "4      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. ly in the arms of victory, at Mantinea, always brought the house down, with more fervor and furore, than any thing I ever did. That, by the way, was the piece, with which we first opened Pompey's magnifi- cent theatre. I played the part, on that occasion, to an audience of fifty thousand of the finest men and women in Rome. W. the Elder. Fifty thousand! What would William Niblo have said to such a house? Pretty busy times among the ticket-takers, in those days! May I venture to inquire -what the receipts, in such a case, would amount to? Ros. Oh, how should I know! Confound this Yankee passion of yours for statistics. We had all prices, of course, from a sestertium down to a dena- rius; or as my friend John here would say, from a ten-guinea box in the dress circle, down to a shilling peep in the upper lobbies. The last benefit I took- on earth, if I remember right, netted me about fifty thousand of your American dollars. The poorest house I ever knew, in Pompey's theatre, strange to say, was when I was playing that very same part of Epaminondas. There were hardly five hundred per- sons present. Ker. Indeed; and pray what was the occasion of that! Ros. Ah, that was an exciting day for Rome;   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      145 the. very day, Kemble, that that traitor. Catiline was driven away from the city, amid the execrations of the people, after that scathing speech of Cicero, which was too much, even for his desperate effron- tery. I was so much absorbed at the time, I remem- ber, in my professional duties, that I was not aware of what was going on in town, though, of course, much surprised at seeing so slender an audience. The moment the news reached us we disappeared, to a man, without the slightest regard to dramatic propriety. I was exceedingly -annoyed afterwards, to find, that while I had been strutting and fretting on the boards, to so little purpose, I had been cheat- ed out of the most magnificent burst of oratory, that was ever heard within the walls of Rome. But, friends, it will never do for me to grow thus garru- lous, while dwelling on these old reminiscences. Kern. Don't say so; go on, go on. By the way, Roscius, you never ventured on comedy, I believe. Res. I ask your pardon; I made some most pal- pable hits in that line. Kent. In what pieces? Ros. Let me see. It is so long ago, and I have had such an infinity of engagements since, that I can't recall these things so readily as I used to. Ah, yes; my Young Velox, in Afranius Speed the Sword, was considered an unqualified success, and  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC8093-00000073"/> "6     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. filled the house for fifty successive days. My Cra- tinucs, in The Two Gentlemen of Carthage, was well spoken of by. the critics. My Corvus, in Plau- tus's glorious old play, the Midsummer-Day's Dreant, and my Popilius, in the Conquest of Nu- manraia, were both highly popular. Julius Caesar himself, I remember, wrote me a very gratifying note, commendatory of the latter performance. I recollect making a decided hit, too, in Terence's fa- vorite comedietta of Fish olut of Water. Kem. What, what, what? Reos. I say, in Terence's Fish out of Water. Kern. Ah, that won't do, Roscius.: The idea of passing off as Roman, as genuine an English farce as ever was written! Ros. How's that? Kern. I repeat it.; the idea of trying to make out my old friend, Sam Savory, a native of the Eternal City, won't go down. W. the Elder. No, indeed. I should as soon have pitched upon Communipaw, for the birth-place of Coriolanus. Ros. Savory? Savory?   That's not the name of the hero in the piece to which I refer; but Ca- millus, a fine, young, dashing fellow, but most fright- fully impulsive, who falls in love with every pretty   SPIRITUAL VISITORSl.     147 girl he meets, and gets into all manner of scrapes in consequence.

Go on with - your enumeration. Ros. But wherefore, Kemble? Why dig up all these dead and gone plays, and'players, and play houses? It surely can't interest you much, and it only makes me melancholy. Ah, dear! to think that of the myriads of sparkling, pungent comedies that were in vogue in my day, hardly a .baker's dozen have descended to posterity! And that of such a host of superb actors, and delicious actresses, as I knew, and who had their full share of plaudits and laurels, in the flesh, my own humble self alone -have been snatched from oblivion. Out upon the injustice of time, the mockery of fame! And so let me drop the subject, by simply saying, that on the whole, I took far more pleasure in, and will be far longer remembered -by, my buskin-parts, than by anything I ever did in my socks. And that, my friend, I take to be your case. Kem. I suppose so.

And yet we are wrong, my ghostly brethren-we are all wrong in this, or else certain great critics of the metropolis are. Ros. What great critics? W. the Elder.

I am pretty well posted up, I believe, in your New-York theatricals. W. the Elder. Have you been to Burton's? Ros. Oh, yes, several times. W. the Elder. How did you like him? Ros. I was exceedingly pleased. He is evident- ly a master of his art. W. the Elder. What roles have you seen him in? Ros. In the impersonations of Sleek, Squeers, Acres, Toodle, the Elder Rapid, and Mistress Van- derpants. W. the Elder. A pretty wide range, that. Ros. Yes; and it seemed to me that he filled them all, with a singular fidelity to nature, and an evident attention to details. Some of his faces were, not only overwhelmingly funny, but most careful studies, such as Theophrastus himself might have written from. At least it struck me so. W. the Elder. Didn't you find him rather coarse at times? Ros. Well, I was annoyed once or twice, by a tendency that way. I regret to add, however, that the audience generally seemed to encourage and relish those very blemishes, far more than they did  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC8093-00000076"/> 152     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. the more elaborate and artistic parts of his adting. There was another performer there, who made a most delightful impression upon me. He played old Grandfather - W. the Elder. Whitehead-Whitehead. Ros. The same; a most delicious bit of pathos. I couldn't stand it, I confess, but blubbered like a boy. W. the Elder. Have you seen Jesse Rural  Ros. To be sure I have. W. the Elder. A miserable humbug, wasn't it? Ros. Yes; just about as stupendous a failure, in its way, as brother John's Macheth here was in its, or his kinsman's Benedict. I wouldn't have missed it for a great deal. We had no such character on the stage, in my day, and (to confess the truth), though there were plenty of good men, and good. women, and happy firesides, in Rome, then, we had no such religion out of which to make it. W. the Elder. Do you know, Roscius, that the critic, to whom I before referred, actually objected to the introduction of this character on the boards, as a piece of sacrilege? Ros. Why, what an infinitesimally small-minded creature he must be! Kem. Yes; I should as soon -think of leaving Parson Adams out of Joseph Andrews. But, friends,  how do you reconcile all this admirable acting with   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      153 said critic's allegation of the rapid decadence of the drama? Ros. True, if you had been at Wallack's last night. too, I think you would have inferred, both from the quality of the audience and of the perform- ance, that there was some little life left in it yet. Kern. Ah, what were they doing? Ros. Playing the Lady of Lyons. Kern. And who was the Claude? Some vulgar, brawny, ranting, thigh-slapping creature, I dare say. Ros. Oh no, no, no, no; tout au contraire ; one of the most handsome, refined, intelligent actors that I ever saw; anything but a ranter. Indeed, I thought he was too quiet in the earlier scenes. At the close of the fourth act, though, he gave us a glorious burst of passion that quite took the house by surprise. Kern. And the Pauline? Ros. When I say that Miss Keene played it- W. the Elder. Ah, isn't she sweet? I'm quite in love with that girl. Ros. How dare you talk about being in love, land- lord, close alongside of the grave, as you are? W. the Elder. Well, I can't help it; there's something so gentle and lady-like about her-such a pleasant mixture of archness and pathos. I havn't been so pleased with any performer since Mrs. Mason left the stage.  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC8093-00000077"/> 154     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. Kern. Well, friends, I can't stop here, listening to any more of your criticisms. My time's up. Ros. What hurries you? Kem. Well, i'm hard at work on my great part of George Washington. I'm very anxious about it, I confess. I wo ldn't fail in it for all the gold dust in the system. Ros. If agreeable, I'll go with you. Pray, who's the author? Kern. No less a bard than rare Ben himself. Ros. Indeed! Well let's be off. Adieu, land- lord. W. the Elder. One word, Roscius, before you go. Do you happen to know of any authentic bust of yourself? If so, I confess I should dearly love to add it to my little collection here. Ros. I'm afraid you'll not find such a thing on the planet. There are a few stray ones, sc'attered about in other luminaries. There may be some at the bottom of the Tiber. If the Pope were willing to let you Yankees drag the river with him, on shares- W. the Elder. We'veaskedhim. Hewon'tagree to it. Ros. Then you'll have to do without the article. Farewell.

And you, my mortal friend, are very pre- sumptuous to talk in this positive, peremptory way, to a ghost of my experience. W. the Elder. I really ask pardon. I spoke impulsively, as I always do; but I intended no disre- spect, I assure you. However, I am expecting the spirit of brother Fulton here every second, and if you say so, we will refer the point in controversy to him. Arch. Agreed. W. the Elder. You know him, perhaps. Arch. To be sure I do; and a most choice spirit he is. We have not compared notes for some time, however.

Why, really, my old host, you quite put me   i to the blush.         .           I W. the Elder. But what kept you so? I began to fear that my lightning dispatch had missed you. Ful. I came the very instant you sent for me. most reluctantly, too, I assure you; for I was in the X company of some very dear friends. But what, in    ' the name of wonder, were you making such a noise about? I expected to find at least a score of cats  i fighting as I entered. You look flushed, too, land-  lord. Nothing unpleasant has occuarred, I trust. W. the Elder. Oh no, no; we were talking ear- nestly, and perhaps somewhat too swiftly for strict . etiquette; nothing more. Ful. And what may the theme of all this oratory    I have been?  Arch. Ah, that's just what we want you to know;  a subject which my earthly friend, here, tells me has caused a good deal of stirqlately in this quarter of this little globe of his. Ful. Ah, what is it?   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     157 Arch. Hot air as a marine motor. Ful. How? W. the Elder. The motive power of hot air, as illustrated in the Ericsson engine. You have not heard of it, evidently. Ful. Indeed I have not. W. the Elder. Well, then, sit down, my dear spirit, and learn all about it. [Hands him news- paper.] There, my friend, you'll see all the diagrams and descriptions necessary for elucidating the mat- ter. If, after due examination, you agree with Ar- chimedes in pronouncing it a colossal humbug- Arch. Don't misrepresent me. I used no such language. On the contrary, I expressed the warm- est admiration of the inventor's genius. All I said was, that I did not think that this particular speci- men of it would ever lead to any great practical re- sult. W. the Elder. And I say it will. I believe this same Air Engine to be the great wonder of the age-  the great revolutionizer of the business of the world. Arch. And who, pray, is most likely to be right-   a scientific ghost of more than two thousand years' standing, like myself, or a mortal who has hardly got beyond his earthly threescore? Ful. Gentlemen, gentlemen, do be quiet, or I shall never get to the bottom of this thing.  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC8093-00000079"/> 158      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. Arch. I ask your pardon, Fulton; but our host here is such an obstinate being, that-           Ful., Well, well, keep still a moment. [He contin- utes his examination.] Charming, charming! That regenerator is really a most beautiful device ; so sim- ple, too. Bravo, Captain, bravo! What a saving of hands, too, and above all, of fuel. W. the Elder. Ah, ha! didn't I tell you- Ful. [still talking to himself.] And yet--and yet--- Arch. Well, great King of Steam, what sayest thou? Out with it. Ful. And yet, Archimedes, there seems to be one terrible drawhack here. Arch. You mean, of- course, the frightful waste of power. Ful. Even so; nor do I see how, with such an agent, the difficulty can be remedied. Where, in the name of heaven, is the expansive force to come from?? Arch. Just what- I told my old friend, here, but he would not be persuaded. I demonstrated to him, as I thought, that there was not only a want of pow-   i er to start with, but a great loss of it on the road.   ! Ful. You're right-quite right; a fearful dis- count. No less than two-thirds of the force acquired is evidently expended on the feed-pumps, and the j   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     159 poor paddle-wheels have to put up with the balance. That will never do, in the world. Yes, the more I look at it, Archimedes, the more convinced am I that your views are correct. And yet, what a pretty thing it is; what a fascinating idea! Arch. A most ingenious toy, certainly; but as to its ever playing a prominent part in human affairs, I don't believe a word of it. Ful. You don't think, then, that my nose is to be put out of joint quite yet? Arch. No, indeed, Robert. I believe that the wonders and glories of terrestrial steam navigation are only just beginning, and that your fame, as an inventor and benefactor, is more and more apprecia- ted every hour. I see no rival near your throne. Presumptuous as it may seem for any being, mortal or spiritual, to assign limits to the progress of sci- ence, I yet unhesitatingly predict, and I am willing to stake my reputation as an engineer upon the pro- phecy, that no power will ever be found on earth to supplant steam as a propeller. As to the motive forces of other worlds, we are, of course, not at lib- erty to disclose them to mortals. W. the Elder. I take it for granted, Archimedes, that hot air is a good deal of a motor, in certain un- pleasant and unmentionable regions. Arch. Don't be irreverent, old man. These are  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC8093-00000080"/> 160     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. not themes to be joking about. I was not speaking as a moralist, however, but merely as a ghost of science. Ful. On the whole, my Sicilian friend, I agree with you. I do not believe that any agent, of air or earth, willever fill steam's place as general errand boy and factotum for the human family. But if it prove otherwise, heaven forbid that any paltry feel- ingof jealousy should prevent me from singing its praises with the loudest. Arch. I have no doubt of it, my large-hearted brother; I've no doubt of it. W. the Elder. Well, gentlemen, after two such emphatic verdicts from two such authorities, I, of course, give up the point. It isn't so strange, though3 that I should have manifested some feeling on the subject, considering how excited the public mind has been about it, of late. Ful. Indeed! W. the Elder. Yes, the papers have been crowd- ed with it. Never, never have I known such a flourish of trumpets, as that with which the result of the recent trial-trip of the Ericsson was proclaim- ed to the world; enough to blow down a dozen Jeri- chos. Let me show you a specimen or two. Look at- that article, for instance [hands Fulton a morn- ing paper]; What say you to that, now 2   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     161 Ful. [after a hasty perusal]. Glowing language, certainly. The writer speaks of me, I see, and my performances, as obsolete ideas, already. Did. you read it, Archimedes? Arch. I did. As a mere cluster of pretty sen- tences, it is not so bad; but, in all other respects, worthless. So yeasty and turbulent, too; plenty of the froth of the enthusiast in it, but very little of the solidity of the philosopher. It is evidently the work of a smatterer, also. As you must have perceived, there are half a dozen'mistakes in the very first half column, that no man or ghost of science could ever have made. Ful. Yes, I see; and then so saucy and aggres- sive! Arch. Ah, my friend, if there is any one thing more offensive to me than another, it is this same arrogance of half-knowledge; this insolence of theory-bitten visionaries, who are determined to force their whims down the throats of the commu- nity, at all hazards; men who despise facts; who are ready to trample upon everything lovely and sacred, in the mad chase after novelties, and- Ful. You wax warm, brother. Arch. I am warm, Fulton. As a lover of truth and sound philosophy, I protest against such crea- tures.  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC8093-00000081"/> 162     SPIRITUAIL VISITORS. W. the Elder. Here's another article; how does that strike you? Ful. [glancing at it.] Worse and worse; in fact, perfectly fulsome and ridiculous. I will do the wri- ter the justice, however, to believe that he must have been under the influence of artificial stimulus, when he wrote it. 1X. the Elder. Well, it has been insinuated that the fixed air of the champagne so freely discussed on said trial-trip, was a prominent motor of many of the goose-quills that were set going on that occa- sion. Arch. And how with that other old-fashioned, world-wide motor, the dollar? PFul. For shame, Archimedes! How dare you insinuate that the press of this glorious metropolis is open to any such influences? You seem to for- get, my friend, how much the morals of the world have mended in the twenty centuries that have elapsed since you used to hob-and-nob with old King Hiero. Arch J[aside.] I don't believe a word of it. W. the Elder. But, to change the subject; you were saying, my honored guest, that my lightning- missive had called you away from some dear friends. May 1, without impropriety, inquire who they were? \rpr      iqi   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     163 Ful. Certainly. I was paying a visit at Cler- mont.' W. the Elder. Indeed! You mean, of course, at the former residence of your old co-mate and brother- experimenter, the Chancellor. Full. The same. I came without an invitation, however; but wa s none the less heartily welcomed for that, I assure you. W. the Elder. And was this your first spiritual visit there  Ful. The very first. Do you know that I have not had a peep at the Hudson, no, nor at any part of my native land, till a week ago yesterday, ever since my exodus from the flesh! T. the Elder. Ah!   What an exciting and gratifying trip you must have had of it! Such changes, Fulton; such glorious chances! Fill. Enough to fill an epic poem, had I the gen- ius to put them into verse. In what other clime or era have fifty little years wrought such marvels? W. the Elder. And you, yourself, and Living- ston, and Clinton, and one or two others, at the bot- tom of it all! Happy dogs, how it must delight vou to think that you played your little- parts on earth to such good purpose! Come, Fulton, tell our mathematical friend here, all about your first voy- age up the river., That was a trial-trip, now, worth  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC8093-00000082"/> 164     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. talking about. You didn't have quite so much champagne aboard, to be sure, as brother Ericsson had. Ful. No, we were in no drinking mood, that day. It was a sad, solemn business, I can tell you. But why revive the past? Archimedes don't want to hear it. Arch. To say truth, friends, I have heard all about it more than once. Ful. Indeed; from whomr? Arch. Why, from no less a ghost than Story him- self. Ful. What, the great jurist? Arch. Jurist, orator, poet, statesman, philanthro- pist, everything that's good; and, above all, the most indefatigable chatter-box I ever ran against. Isn't that his American reputation? W. the Elder. Most unquestionably. (The nar- rative couldn't have been in better hands, I assure you. Arch. It was but yesterday, by the way, that I was inquiring of one .of your citizens, as to the whereabouts of brother Robert's statue; and, do you believe it, the man stared at me. On my re- peating the question, he walked-off whistling; as if I  had been a runaway lunatic, forsooth.

TW. the Elder. I should be most happy to, were it in my power. Arch. And why is it not? W. the Elder. Simply because there is no such work in esse, Arch. What-no record of Robert Fulton either in bronze or marble, in all this broad land? 'W. the Elder. Nothing of the sort. What is more, I doubt if there be any artist in town suffi- ciently sanguine even to have modelled any such thing. Arch. And no portrait to show the stranger? W. the Elder. I have never seen any either at the Federal, or any state capitol. There may be a few dubious daubs about, in museums, but certainly nothing that I should be over-anxious to send to the coming World's Fair. Arch. Why, what a disgrace to the nation! W. the Elder. But so it is. Our legislators don't approve of works of art; and as to the citizens, they prefer investing their surplus funds in silks, satins, canvass back ducks, perigord pies, and such like substantials. I have no doubt, Archimedes, that there is more money spent in the country, in one  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC8093-00000083"/> 166     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. day, on candy alone, than would pay both for your own and brother Fulton's statue. And yet, my friend, I know not why you should be so amazed at it, when you recall the circumstances connected wi;h your own tomb-stone. Arch. [aside.] That's a home-thrust, sure enough. Ful. Ah, what were they?  I have forgotten them. W. the Elder. Why, surely, you must remember them. His own countrymen treated him so neglect- fully that they couldn't tell where his bones lay, a little century after his death, till an illustrious stran- ger came, along, one fine morning, and brought the poor, crumbling monument to light, buried, as it was, under brambles, and its inscriptions devoured, to the last letter. Pretty treatment, indeed, for the great- est mathematician of his age; for him, too, who had so often saved his native city from destruction; by the timely display of his genius. There was national gratitude for you! Ah, there's a stinging moral about that story, Archimedes, that impresses me far more, I must say, than a whole barrel of sermons on the vanity of life. Ful. I have no right to grumble, certainly, after such a statement as this. Arch. Let me see. I was going to make another inquiry, but, of course, it is superfluous.   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     167 W. the Elder. What was it? Ar6h. Whether there was any model of the Cler- ,ont extant? WTi the Elder. Certainly not. As certainly there ought to be. Yes, every State in the Union ought to have a complete gallery of models of all our steamers, from our brother's primitive little craft here, up to the last chef-d'ceuvre of Collins. Leav- ing national pride out of the question, such a collec- tion would be invaluable as a guide for the student, and as a faithful record of the progress of invention; but, as I said before, we prefer laying out our odd dollars on champagne and oysters. Arch. Well, well, brethren, time will set all things to rights, depend upon it. The day hasn't come yet for statues and galleries, in your country. You are yet among the dirt and rubbish, laying the massive foundations of the edifice ; the delicate and beautiful labors of the entablature will all come along in God's good season; and who can doubt that the genera- tions to whom they are entrusted, will prove them- selves worthy of the master-builders who have pre- ceded them? Yes, my friend, poetic justice will be rendered in full to you, and to all the benefactors of your land. Nay, that very story that our old host here told against me just now, I think tells far more in my favor. I think he read the moral wrong.  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC8093-00000084"/> 168     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. The true inference to be derived from the anecdote, seems to-me to be this: that real genius must and will, sooner or later, directly or indirectly, vindi- cate its claim to immortality. To be thus forgotten by Syracuse, was certainly mortifying; but to be so revived, and made forever illustrious, by a Cicero, was it not a glorious revenge?  You, Fulton, how- ever, of all that have been on earth, surely least stand in need of statue or monument. Your produc- tions speak for themselves; no locking them up in inglorious slumber, in musty libraries; where are they not, night and day, singing your praises? What sea, what river knows them not? The dis- pensers of fame, the pioneers of civilization, the cir- culators of bright thoughts and glad tidings, yea, of all manner of good things all over the globe! W. the Elder. Even so. What were-all your old demi-gods, Archimedes, alongside of our illustrious brother here? What was the club of Hercules, or the lute of Orpheus, or even the wand of Mercury himself, compared with the trophies of the great steam-king? Ful. Why, landlord, you are growing poetical in your old age. But, brethren, it is time for me to put my spiritual paddle-wheels in motion. Arch. Whither away, brother navigator?   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     169 Ful t Well, I've got some little engineering busi- ness to do in a constellation hard by. W. the Elder. Civil or military? Ful. Civil, heaven be praised! I rejoice to say that all my labors, since leaving earth, have been m the cause of peace. Arch. But what may it be? Ful. I am superintending the construction of an aqueduct in the star Cordelia. Arch. Ah, is that your work? I had a peep at it recently. A superb affair it is, too. That second distributing reservoir, with the Corinthian columns round it, and the statue-crowned balustrade, struck me as being the finest thing of the kind, I had al- most said, in the universe. Is that really your de- sign, brother F. 1 I had no idea that you were so illustrious an artist as well as engineer. Ful. It is. I began life as a painter, you know. W. the Elder. Have you seen our Croton Re- servoirs, Archimedes? Arch. I have. They. are mere tea-cups in com- parison with the one I speak of. But I must be off, too. W. the Elder. What hurries you? Arch.

Even so. -And let me tell you, my earthly friend, that the science is a million-fold more sublime and beautiful, when investigated from such a grand, central point, than you residents of this little, roving planet have any idea of. W. the Elder. I supposed you had greater facili- ties and finer instruments there. Ah, dear, I wish I was going with you. Arch. Be patient, be patient, old gentleman. Your time will come soon enough. Only behave yourself, and you'll see all these fine things, in your turn. Meanwhile, take an honest ghost's advice, and keep cool. Don't anticipate matters. See and learn all you can here below. Do all the good you can. Try to leave this dear little earth in a better condition than you found it. And above all things, my dear host, give the Rappers a wide birth, for I assure you they are the greatest humbugs that ever picked a public's pocket. W. the Elder. But, Archimedes, am I really to infer, from what brother Fulton said just now,' that there are no wars in the worlds around us . What,   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      171 no bloodshed or violence, no fire-arms, no military tactics of any sort? Ful. I said not that, my friend. But you had better ask no more questions. You are getting on ticklish ground. I fear we have already made some injudicious disclosures. Come, brother Archimedes, I must positively be off. So, good-bye, fellow-coun- tryman. W. the Elder.

So far from persecuting the christians, I was their constant friend; nay, I did all that I could, in a life, not over-long, and, as you well know, crowded with studies, and cares, and wars, to protect them from injustice.

That I properly appreciated, still less comprehended, the sublime doctrines of christi- anity, while in the body, as, thank heaven, I since have, in the spirit, this I do not pretend to say. How could I, situated as I was, with all my preju- dices both as a Roman and a philosopher, enlisted against the new religion; that religion,. too, strug- gling for life, as it were, on the borders of my em- pire; having, as yet, not one great name, or tower- ing intellect connected with it, ridiculed by the cour- tiers, sneered at by the scholars of my court; would it not have been strange, Howard, under the cir- cumstances, if I had rightly understood its divine beauty and significance? But that I ever lifted a finger against any follower of Jesus, or allowed one to be lifted, unless he were found wantonly disturb- ing the public peace, and preaching insurrection, this I emphatically deny, notwithstanding all that bigoted ecclesiastics may have said or written to the contrary. How. I am delighted with this explanation, my friend; it is a great relief to my mind, I assure you. Such conduct seemed so anomalous, so irreconcilea- ble with the whole tenor of your earthly pilgrimage. Aur. I persecute the Christians, indeed? Do I look like a persecutor, Howard?

Aur. Very civilly spoken, my good host. But, after all, what signifies a handsome face, even though lit up by intelligence? Unless the divine light of goodness shine through it, what a mockery is it! W. the Elder. Even so; and that's precisely the secret of your good looks. Do you know, Aurelius, that your features are more studied by our artists than those of any other classic notability that has come down to us; and, above all, by those who seek to reproduce the great teacher, on canvas?

Act well your part here below, and you'll see them all, and their works, in good time. But, to change the theme; my dear brother philanthropist, (if I may be allowed so to call you,) whence come you? What labors of love have you been suspending, to honor me with this interview? How. Nothing very special: I've not been over- busy lately. 'What little I have done has been in Ursa Major? W. the Elder. Ah! How. I call the constellation by that name, be- cause our earthly friend here, knows it by no other. W. the Elder. And pray, what do you immortals call it? How. Philadelphia; most deservedly so, too, for there's scarcely a group of stars in the Universe, where brotherly love more abounds. W. the Elder. Well, that's pleasant news. One would infer, certainly, from our christening, that there was a fair share of growling, and by no means the pleasantest kind of hugging, there. And how is it with the other constellations? Are they all given up to the same pleasant employments? And is all the fighting in our own system, confined to this disreputable little planet of ours?

But as brother Aurelius intimated just now, we may not answer them. This is forbidden ground on which you tread. I can only reply to you generally, and once for all, by saying, that it is not for the frail, feeble-witted tenants of earth, to know or to conceive of the duties, joys, or sorrows of an Universe like ours. Rest assured, though, that to whatever sphere of action, the Great Father may see fit to summon his earthly children, they!will find quite enough there, to task all their powers, to develope all their qualities, be it for good, or be it for evil. And now friend Aurelius, let me inquire in turn, where do you hail from last? Aur. Boston. W. the Elder. What is there a constellation of that name, too? Aur. Not at all. I speak not of any celestial group, or luminary, but of your own little earthly Boston. 1 have been spending the last ten days there, under the roof of one of its merchant-princes. How. Quite an attractive, exemplary little city, is it not? Aur. I must say, I was quite delighted with it; a mere ward, to be sure, alongside of my own impe- rial Rome, but in many respects, far its superior.  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC8093-00000089"/> 178     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. Horw. They have some most praise-worthy chari- ties there, I am told. Aur. They have, indeed. I have been employed for the past week, in exploring them, with my excel- lent host. There are no finer Schools, or Hospitals, in the System; and then such a multiplicity of In- stitutions and Asylums, for all manner of mental and physical infirmities; so richly endowed, too, so ad- mirably organized and administered ; I was really charmed. How. No such retreats for lunatics, or schools for idiots, Aurelius, when you wore the imperial purple. Aur. No, indeed; nor any such Prison Discipline. I blush when I think how shamefully we neglected these things. Disgraceful as the confession is, my friend, it is none the less true, that of all the stately structures that crowned our seven historic hills, not a solitary one was dedicated to charitable uses; while here is a little town, hardly two centuries old, crowded with all sorts of benevolent associations. What a mortifying contrast! -Oh, had we spent a tenth part of the time and labor and treasure, that we were eternally squandering on- barbarous wars and childish triumphal processions, in the same sensible way that these men. of New England spend theirs, what magnificent Colleges and Hospitals we should have had!

Who can tell, what an influence it might have exerted, on the destinies of the world; how much more of our literature and philosophy would have been preserved; how much more wise and peaceful the whole earth might have been, this very hour! I lose all pa- tience, at times, when I think of such abominable neglect and perversion. When I think too, of the profligacy and blood-shed, that, in broad day-light, disgraced our Roman streets, even in my time, and in spite of all my efforts to the contrary, and then contrast them with the beautiful spectacle presented by Boston, yesterday, (your blessed SabbatlL) with its crowds of well-clad and decorous citizens, repairing so quietly to their respective places of worship; every man, woman, and child, looking so bright and comfortable; not a drunkard or vagabond any where to be seen; not a single uncomely sight, or uncouth sound, to mar the picture of peace, and order, and obedience to laws, divine and human; I say, my friend, when I contrast the two scenes, I confess that my Roman pride quite melts away with- in me, and I am compelled to acknowledge the im- measurable superiority, in all truly great qualities,    &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC8093-00000090"/> 180     SPIRITUAL VISITOIRS. of the young Athens of Atmerica, to my own haughty, guilty metropolis. W. the Elder. And yet, there are a good many croakers about, who stoutly deny the facts to which your Highness has just borne witness ; and who get downright mad, at the bare suggestion that there has been any improvement in the faith or morals of the world, since your day. Aur. What, no progress in the piety, or patriot- ism, or intelligence of the world? Monstrous as- sertion! As well say that the Bunker's Hill Monu- ment preaches no more grand and lofty lessons to humanity than an Egyptian obelisk, or that the tomb of Washington points no higher moral, than that of Achilles! How can any sensible ghost or mortal, utter such absurdities? How. True; else were all history the veriest farce. W. the Elder. May I enquire, if your Grace stop- ped at Rome, on your way to Boston? Aur. I did alight, for a few moments, on my own column. I say my own, though I found an ecclesias- tical friend had very quietly taken possession. How. You mean St. Paul. Aur. The same. Had I been ousted by any less notable saint, I own I should have been somewhat jealous; but seeing that it was the glorious apostle   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     181 himself, I acquiesced most cheerfully, in the arrange- ment.

What connection, under heaven, is there be- tween his life and writings, and your victories over the Germans and Parthians, as there commemora- ted? Brother Howard's features would be quite as appropriate there. Aiur. Well, I confess, I cannot see any, except that we were all pretty good fighters, in our day, though against very different adversaries. How. But, Aurelius, was this your first visit there, since death 7 Aur. The very first. How. Heavens! What must your meditations have been! What amazing, what terrible changes! Aur. Enough, certainly, to test one's philosophy. Ah, Howard, had I still retained the sentiments and prejudices, with which I left the earth, the sight would have been an appalling one, indeed! What a chaos of ruins! - Of all the princely piles I left be- hind me, some scattered few alone could I recognize, and they, sadly shorn of their lustre. There was the Pathenon, to be sure; but half-buried under rubbish, and deformed by the vile additions of some modern builder; there was my predecessor's temple, that I myself dedicated, and that the people of Rome  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC8093-00000091"/> 182     SPIRITUAL VrSITORS. took more pride in, than in any other structure of my time; but oh, how fallen from its high estate, of its once magnificent portico, a few columns alone, could-I trace, and these -forming part of the wall of a vile custom-house. There-too, was the tomb of my imperial brother Augustus, but stripped of all its flowers and evergreens, and statues, nay, transform- ed into a filthy circus, for clowns to tumble in ; and the still more sumptuous tomb of brother Adrian, that nonpareil of mausoleums; there it was, in the old spot, indeed, but how bare and black, how shorn of all its splendors; no longer a resting-place for monarchs, but a dismal combination of castle and prison. What a desecration was this, my friend! There too was the pillar of our beloved Trajan, but no Trajan at the top of it; he too, pulled down, it seems, like myself, to make way for an apostolic usurper; and there were his Dacian victories, fresh almost as when Apollodorus chiselled them; but where was the magnificent foi um beneath, and the tem- ple and triumphal the arch, and his exquisite eques- trian statue, that we so loved to show our children? Where were the fountains, and the porticoes, and the gay shops, and that dear Ulpian library of ours, the head-quarters of all the wits and scholars of the metropolis, when I was young; where I so loved to drink in the melodious wisdom of the Academy, not   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.       183 forgetting the while, the sterner lessons of the Porch? Where were all these favorite haunts, these' stately piles? Nothing, nothing was there, to bear witness to all these splendors, but a few stumps of columns, and scattered bits of pavement, dragged to light from beneath the filth and rubbish of the modern town. Changes, indeed, my friend, heart-sickening changes! Yes, Howard, I repeat it, had I gazed on the sad scene, merely as a mortal and a Roman, I could not have endured it; but to the imrmortal and the Christian, how different were the lessons it conveyed! But why weary you with these reflections? Why speak, either, of the silent, desolate campagna, so crowded with farms and villas, in my day; or of the poor, dead Forum ; or the deserted, crumbling Baths, once so alive with all that was elegant and luxurious; or of the shat- tered Colosseum; or of my own regal home upon the Palatine, once so magnificent, now a hideous mass of ruins! o Cypress and ivy, weed and wall-flower grown, Matted and mass'd together, hillocks heaped On what were chambers, arch crush'd, column strown In fragments, chok'd up vaults, and frescos steep'd In subterraneous damps, where the owl peep'd, Deeming it midnight: W. the Elder.

What is there so strange in that? W. the Elder. Well, I confess I was rather sur- prised to find that Childe Harold had such an uni- verse-wide circulation, already. I am delighted to hear it, though, as a most enthusiastic admirer of the poem. Ilow. I don't sympathize at all, with you, there. It is altogether too heathenish a production, to suit me. Nevertheless, such are the facts. Aur. [who has not heeded the interruption,] Ah, my friend, with what fearful vividness, has your illustrious poet brought the- sad spectacle before us! W. the Elder. And is there no exaggeration, no sacrifice of truth to poetry, in this terrible descrip- tion of his? Aur. Not the least; the description is as accu- rate, as the reflections he makes upon it, are just; though somewhat bitter withal: There is the moral of all human tales;  'Tis but the same rehearsal of the past, First Freedom, and then Glory-when that fails, Wealth, vice, corruption,-barbarism at last. And History, with all her volumes vast, Hath but one page ; and that- But enough of this sad theme, my friends.                      v   XI      SPIRITUIAL VISITORS.     185 Howo. If I remember right, Aurelius, you have some very pointed remarks of your own, on the sub- ject of ruins, in the famous Meditations. Aur. I dare say, though I can't recall them this moment. Ali, Howard, if I had that book to write over, I should make a very different thing of it, with my present enlarged experience, and spiritualized views. How. You certainly ought to be pretty well cured of your Stoicism, by this time. W. the Elder. May I further inquire if your ex- cellency came direct from BRome to the Bay State, or did you stop to take a peep at Paris or London, en route? Aur. I came as straight, my friend, as the paral- lel of 42 N. would bring me, turning neither to the right or left, till the Boston state-house hove in sight. W. the Elder. You didn't happen to fall in with either of the Collins' steamers? Aur. I did not. About midway across, however, I remember seeing a little black thing crawling over the water, about three leagues and a half below me, and looking no bigger than a half-grown cockroach. W. the Elder.

I don't wonder, by the way, at the surprise you expressed, Aurelius, coming thus suddenly from your own shattered town, with its extinct emperors and pontiffs fast going to extinction, to the bright bustling, spunky, granite-faced Boston. Aur. It was, certainly, a most startling contrast. How. I think, my friend, that I could guess the name of the mortal you are stopping with. I've been under his roof myself,-more than once, too, if I mistake not. Aur. I dare say. He is very famous, I find, both for this hospitality and his benevolence. They tell me there is -not a corner-stone of any charitable institution for leagues and leagues around him, in which future ages will not find his name honorably mentioned. The blind, above all others, however, have reason to sing his praises. Houw. That's the man. I know him well; many a time has he invoked my shade while planning and executing his charities. But, my imperial brother, I must be off. Atur. I am sorry you must leave us so soon. But now that we have found each other out, my friend, I hope we shall be more sociable in future, for I know no ghost in whose books I would rather be regis- tered. How. You flatter me, Aurelius.

Why, my dear host, you seem embarrassed! What ails you? W. the Elder. Well, to say truth, I did shudder somewhat, at my own presumption,in having in- vited ladies so illustrious to- quarters so humble; nor have I quite recovered yet from  the sur- prise of this so sudden and gracious response on your'part. But do, pray, be seated. Most deeply do I regret that I have no accommodations to offer you, more worthy of such genius and goodness. Lady J. Come, come, my old friend; there is no occasion for this profusion of apologies, or extrava- gance of language. W. the Elder. I begyour Grace's pardon.

Lady J. Well, well, as you will. I would not find fault with an honest enthusiasm. W. the Elder. But, pray tell me, Corinna, where did you get that exquisite bouquet? Cor. It was given me by my sweet sister here, just as we met at your door. Charming little family- gathering, is it not? W, the Elder. Superb-superb! Lady J. There- are worse in the universe, cer- tainly. Ah! dear, Itis but a little hour ago that these playthings were blooming and nodding their pretty heads to each other, millions and millions of leagues from here. Little did they dream of such a strange translation as this. W. the Elder. They don't seem to have suffered much from the journey. But what curious varie- ties! I'm quite among strangers here, I assure you. To be sure, I'm not over-well-read in our earthly flowers. If my dear little niece were only here now, she'd have a world of questions to ask you about them. Cor. Far more than we should feel at liberty to answer, I dare say. But suppose you give them to her (my dear friend here permitting), with my love. W. the Elder.

By the way, Corinna, I take it for granted, from what you said just now, that her Ladyship and you are old acquaintances. Cor. Yes, indeed, we are old and firm friends. I consider the enjoyment of her society as among the very highest of my spiritual privileges. And then, such a discreet adviser as she is; correcting my blunders, and checking my giddiness in such a gentle, pretty way, that I am almost tempted to do wrong, for the sake of her sweet reproof Lady J. Corinna, Corinna, don't talk so! Cor. And then, so accomplished! Do you know, my old friend, that she actually talks and writes a prettier Greek than I do, myself; yes, beats me on my own ground; makes sweeter music; composes lovelier hymns. W. the Elder. I took it for granted, of course, that her grace was all-accomplished I have often regretted, indeed, that she was not permitted to live out her days on earth. Our terrestrial literature and music would, I am sure, have been great gainers in consequence. But I ask ten thousand pardons for alluding to a theme so painful.   !"      SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      191 Lady J. Not at all-not all, my friend. Your allusion was perfectly natural and proper. My earthly career was indeed a brief one, and its close stained with sorrow and suffering; but, on the whole' there was far more sunshine than gloom in it. Nay, up to the last few months of my pilgrimage, when the ill-judged, wicked ambition of my kindred, placed that fatal bauble on my brow, all had been bright and beautiful around me; not a moment, laden with care or guilt, can I recall; but many, indeed, that kind teachers, pleasant books, sweet, meditations, made precious. And even the last, sad, closing scene-even that, my friend, I have long ago discov- ered, was all for the best-all for the best. W. the Elder. And yet, that bigoted, cruel, bloody Mary- Lady J. Blame her not-blame her not. Ah, there was. far more that was good and loveable about her, than you are aware of. Remember the troub- lous times in which she lived; remember the civil and religious storms that were perpetually raging about her; her bad advisers, her profligate father, the crafty priests that were plying her continually with their false suggestions and poisonous sophisms; remember the innumerable temptations to injustice and cruelty, that surrounded her, and be charitable.  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC8093-00000096"/> -192    SPIRITUAL VISITORS. W. the Elder. Oh, you're the same blessed angel of forgiveness as ever. Lady J. [not heeding the remark.] But, above ball, my friend, be mindful of her bitter suffer- ings since leaving earth; the blessed change that has come over her; her deep and hearty penitence, our sweet reconciliation, and renewed vows, in the land of spirits. Think, think of all these things, and you will surely be less ready to denounce her; nay more, may doubt, perhaps, whether my little ten days' royalty, and untimely death, were not, after all, a more desirable destiny, than her tumul- tuous and blood-stained reign. W. the Elder-.[after a pause.] Indeed, indeed they were. Yes, yes; the more I reflect upon it, the more rejoiced, the more grateful am I, that you died just as you did. Had it been otherwise, what a sweet martyr would have been lost to us--what a precious example for our inspiration! Heaven only knows how many drooping souls that example has already cheered-how much faltering virtue it has confirmed-how many unreasonable murmurs it has stifled!

Again, had your Grace been spared, who knows--but pardon me: I am too bold. Lady J. Not so-not so. I like this honest, truth-seeking disposition of yours. Finish your speech. W. the Elder. I was merely about to add, that had you lived, trouble and grief would too surely have overtaken you. I speak not of the mere* loss of that lustrous beauty, of the clouding of that bright mind, which years must have brought, at last; but might not even your fair fame have been tar- nished? might not " black scandal and foul-faced reproach" have dimmed somewhat its brightness, and in a way that the faithful chronicler, however con- vinced in his own heart, of your innocence, could not have exposed or answered? Ah, yes, 'twas indeed for the best, this early translation of yours, to more blessed realms. You would have been quite out of place in that tumultuous, wicked court of Mary; as much so, as dear Ophelia was, in the corrupt and' riotous one of Denmark. How is it, by the way, that Shakspeare should have overlooked such a glo- rious opportunity of commemorating genius and vir- tue, and not have composed a play in your honor- no, nor even a poor sonnet?

The true Shaksperian smack. What ineffably small beer brother Akenside's lines on her Ladyship, seem in comparison! Cor. I shouldn't wonder, by the way, my old host, if you were a bit of a poet yourself. You have an enthusiastic, fanciful kind of a way about you, cer tainly. -W. the Elder. I a poet?

I did venture once, to be  - sure, on a few stanzas, commemorative of a certain   i cough-candy, which an enterprising-friend was then introducing to the metropolis. They, and a tribute of gratitude to an eminent chiropodist, and a page of " Bonbon-distichs, and a stray charade or two, con-   i stitute my entire poetical works.

But really, my dear host, I am surprised that you did not occasionally venture on themes more worthy of your genius. W. the Elder. I beg your pardon. Those were the very themes that suited my genius.

And do you suppose -that our blessed    i Father in heaven hath banished innocent mirth from any star in his universe? No, indeed. W. the Elder. Well, I have always had a vague kind of feeling that it must be so: but it would mightily astonish some of my orthodox neighbors to  i hear it, I assure you. They have drawn very dif- ferent pictures of the happiness and misery beyond the grave, from those which you have hinted at. Lady J. All mortal speculations touching immor- tal experiences, must, of course, be more or less tinged with error and presumption. The good Book hath said but little about these mysteries, and there- by hath left all the more spacious play-ground for poor human fancies to disport themselves in; and they certainly have led their owners a most strange and capricious dance of it; framing both joys and terrors alike removed from reason and the truth. Far be it from me, my friend, to encourage any un- profitable conferences on these themes; still less, to disclose secrets which are not for mortal ears; but those same sour, puritanical notions, to which you just now alluded (and which were quite too common in my own little day on earth), are so radically un-  . sound, so unworthy of God or of his children, so cal- culated to rob human life of its true relish and signifi-i  cance, that I feel bound, as a truthful spirit, to pro- ,f  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC8093-00000099"/> l198     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. test against them, wherever I may be.

No,indeed; our sister is truly a charming talker, when she gets fairly roused. Lady J. You must excuse me, friends. The theme is too grave a one to be lightly treated. I fear I have said too much, as it is. But, bless me, my worthy host, does your time-piece tell the truth? Mid-day already! Why, I have an appointment with Plato, this very moment; so farewell, friends. W. the Elder. And must your Grace really leave us so abruptly? Lady J. I must, indeed, and without further delay or ceremony; and so, once more, adieu! You'll not forget that little affair I was speaking to you about, Cora? Cor. You may depend upon me, without fail.

You must know, then, that her Ladyship has been occupying some of her leisure hours, lately, in putting Comus into Greek, and she feels somewhat delicate about pre- senting the bard with her version of his poem, till she has-consulted me as to its accuracy. She might far better have referred the matter to Plato ; for, as I told you before, she is more of a Hellenist than I am myself. TW. the Elder. By the way, have you seen Co- rinne lately, Corinna?

Well, to respond in your own style, she is in charming quarters in the star Cenerentola, in tip- : top health and spirits, and writing more delightful romances than ever. You don't often get such r:a- pid and satisfactory answers, do you, my old boy? TV. the Elder. You're not quizzing me, now? Cor. Honor bright.

I ought to know, for it's hardly a week since I met your friends, Malibran and Byron, there. W. the Elder. The deuce you did! And is Mali- bran the same syren, in the spirit, that she was in the body? Cor. Oh, don't ask so many questions. Of course she is; a most fascinating creature. But I must be off. W. the Elder. What, so soon? Cor. Immediately. I have not a very long jour- ney before me, however. W. the Elder. No, I suppose not more than a thousand millions of aerial leagues, or so. Cor. Only to the Fifth Avenue. W. the Elder. Indeed! Cor. And pray, what is there so strange in that? I have been paying visits to a young friend there, more or less, for the last six months. W. theElder. And so you know all about us New Yorkers? Cor. Well, I have seen some little of your best society, as you call it. W. the Elder. And I should infer, from that sarcastic tone, that you didn't think much of it. s          .       .   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      201 Cor. Candidly, I do not. It may seem ungracious to say so, after partaking of its hospitalities ; but so it is. Especially do the evening entertainments, to which it is so addicted, appear to me to be liable to criticism. W. the Elder. Your reasons, sweet swan, your reasons. Cor. Well, in the first place, there is always such a mob of people present; which, of itself, most griev- ously offends my eye, as an artist. What signifies, indeed, elegance of figure, or brilliancy of costume, where we are all jammed together, like so many ber- ries in a basket? And then, the infelicitous ar- rangement of the lights, not collected in grand masses, and with due regard to chiaro-scuro, but scattered all about, in a way to destroy the whole effect of the picture. And then, the absurdly ex travagant display of the supper-tables, loaded down with all manner of dainties and perishable knick- knacks and conceits in sugar; contrasting most painfully, my friend, with the entire absence of works of art, and of objects suggestive of bright thoughts and brilliant repartee ; which to us Greeks, you know, were almost necessaries of life; not to speak of the hot, stifling air, the mad flfow, of wine, and I regret to add, the painful .predominance of bad manners.  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC8093-00000101"/> 202     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. W; the Elder. You certainly are rather severe on us, Corinna. Cor. Don't misunderstand me. I don't mean to say that I haven't stumbled over some dear, delight- ful old ladies and gentlemen, on these occasions, and a few young folks worth looking at and listening to. But far too many of the guests have been miserable foplings, strutting about, with their meagre figures encased in grotesque garments, and with an inso- lence in their manner only equalled by their inanity; and bold young women, with high-pitched voices, and low-cut dresses, in whose faces I could see but faint traces of that gentleness, delicacy, sen- sibility, which are the glory of our sex. W. the Elder. You haven't met with many of Shakspeare's women, then, at these soirees? Cor. What, the Perditas, the Rosalinds, the Imo- gens? Oh no, no, no, no. You introduced this sub- ject, my old friend, remember; and so you mustn't blame me for speaking out, in my own frank way, about it. W. the Elder. You're right, perfectly right. We deserve every word of it. I have sometimes ven- tured on the same strain of remark, myself, but have uniformly been called a miserable old misan- thrope, for my pains. We certainly do behave very ridiculously, and spend our money very absurdly.   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      203 Cor. So it appears to me. I see a grand display of jewelry, furniture, equipages, in this fine town of yours, and a brilliant sight it is, I confess. But then there are other things, far more interesting, that I miss vastly. Where is your Glyptotheca, and your Pinacotheca? Where is your Jardin des Placntes, your Flower-Garden, and above all, your Metropolitan Park, for the poor folks to taste the air in on holidays? TV. the Elder. Where, indeed? I not only see nothing of the sort, myself, but am very much afraid my great-great-grand-children never will, either. Cor. Where, too, are the statues of your Illus- trissimi? Did we treat our benefactors in this style? When I think of our own dear little Athens, that never, in its most prosperous state, had more than a hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants in it, and yet was adorned with such a brilliant marble population, and then of this vast and flourishing metropolis of yours, and the strange contrast it pre- sents in this regard, I feel a's if you ought to be taken to task most severely, for such negligence and perverseness. W. the Elder. Your rebuke is a most righteous one.       / Cor. But I must positively be off. W. the Elder. I am very sorry.

Ah, you're a wicked old wag, I fear for all that solemn phiz of yours. W. the Elder. By the way, have you seen Pin- dar recently? Cor. Not for a great while. W. the Elder. I had the honor of a call from him not long since. Cor., Indeed! You found him agreeable, I hope. W. the Elder. Very pleasant and chatty, I as- sure you. Cor. But, my old host,are you in the habit of having these spiritual receptions? W. the Elder. Well, I see a few select ghosts occasionally; seldom one of your beauty and bril- liancy, however. Cor. Ah, now you're beginning your compliments again-off I fly. W. the Elder. Well, if you must, you must. But do drop down soon again. Cor. I will, and so, bye-bye. W. the Elder.

But if you knew, old gentleman, what a sufferer I have been; yes, yes, both sides of the grave. Oh! Lord, what with pneumonia, strangury, dyspepsia, and every now and then a touch of my old trouble, the St. Vitus, I have a pretty exciting time of it, I tell you. Do you wonder, my friend, that I growl somewhat? W. the Elder. Why, under heaven, didn't you tell me- so, before . To think that I, too, should have been so disrespectful to a ghost for whose genius and goodness I have so profound an admiration! But, Doctor, you certainly did throw about the old Saxon words, for a moment or two, in a style hardly to have been expected from one who makes so little use of them in his writings. John. Well, don't say any more about it. We are a poor set, the best of us, ghosts as well as bodies; a poor set, a poor set. W. the Elder. One thing, however, that you said just now, Doctor, surprises and annoys me beyond measure. I certainly did have a foolish kind of a   SPIRITUAL.

What is it, what is it? John. Well, you must know that our friend here (old enough, certainly, to know better), has been in- vesting no small portion of the evening of his days in the composition of a tragedy, which he has just completed, and about the fate of which he is evi- dently very anxious. Indeed he says in his note to me on the subject, that he has strong hopes of as- tonishing not only all America and Europe, but Asia and Africa likewise, in certain passages of it. Some few: little matters of verbal criticism bothering him somewhat, he thought best to secure my assistance, as being, of course, the great authority of the sys- tem, on those points. We had not been very long employed on our task, when you entered. But what brings you here, Ben? Is it the mere feeling of auld lang syne, or awn idle curiosity- to see the im- provements these Yankees are making in the West- :ernHemisphere of the Planet?

John. Why, bless me, my old host, why didn't you mention this before? We might have waited then for brother Benjamin, and have had the benefit i of his criticisms. He is a better Latinist than I i am, you know, and out of sight of me as a -Hellenist.  Jon. But why is it, old gentleman, that you can't bring out a play without disturbing all Ghostdom on the occasion? I never had any such supernatural aid when I composed my masterpieces, nor had bro- ther Samuel here, either. By the way, Sam, it is but yesterday, that I heard Will himself, blowing you up in good round terms for what he was pleased to call your most pompous and shallow criticisms on some of his performances.

He was perfectly charmed with them; he found them a little too idolatrous, to be sure, in certain passages, not to wound his mod- esty; and here and there, a slight propensity to mysticism; but on the whole (I give you his own words), he -considered them the most subtle, search- ing, delicious specimens of criticism, that ever came from earth.

'I do,' said he, 'most distinctly.' ' Off I go, then,' said I, 'posthaste.' 'Stop,' said he, ' if you are positively unwell, and under medical ad- vice, follow me, without further remarks.' I did so. He straightway conducted me through a long, nar- row passage, into a room with closed shutters, where. by gas-light, he administered unto me, under a name as long as himself, which I cannot now recall, some of the fieriest Hollands I ever encountered.

No, indeed; I was right glad to get into an- other jurisdiction, I assure you. W. the Elder. Well, they're a pretty queer set, up that way. Their intentions are good, I dare say; -but I've no great faith in such legislation, myself. But come, spirits, let's be off, while daylight lasts. [Exeunt.] \   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     225 JULIUS CAESAR.-ZACHARY TAYOR. Cces. I beg your pardon, General; I consider my- self the honored party on this occasion. Tay. No, no, no! don't talk so; the idea of put- ting an old fashioned Yankee Soldier, like me, on the same platform with the greatest fighter of all antiquity ; H Cces. You are too modest, by half. I tell you again, nothing I ever did in Gaul, or Parthia, or Africa, is to be named in the same century with that affair at Buena Vista. Tay. Oh, you're joking. Cces. I am not joking; nor am I alone in the opinion. 'Twas but yesterday that I heard Epami- nondas and Marlborough both saying the very same thing. Leonidas, too, who ought to know what good fighting is, expressed himself most emphatically, on s  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC8093-00000113"/> 226     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. the subject; and also concerning the capture of Monterey. - He looked upon both performances, he said, as among the very happiest military hits on record. Tay. Well, well; after such authorities, it would be sheer affectation in me to say otherwise. I cer- tainly tried to do my duty on that occasion, "es. You did it, too, most nobly, gloriously, my old friend: ay, and on all other occasions, civil and military. I have been longing for an opportunity to tell you so. I know all about you, you see. Tay. Through what channel, may I ask? CBes. Well, the military part of your career was recited to me, not long since, and with a delightful enthusiasm, by your gallant brother, WORTH, the American Murat, as we all call him; while the civil portion of it, was rendered ample justice to, let me tell you, by that choicest of choice spirits, HENRY CLAY himself. Tay. Indeed! That was very magnanimous in brother Hal, considering that I (most innocently, it is true, nay reluctantly), stood so in the way of his earthly ambition. He alluded, then, did he, to the Presidential campaign? Cmes. He told me the whole story; and, so far as I-could judge, with perfect frankness and good- humor. He wound up his narrative, I remember,   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     227 by remarking, with great emphasis, that he would rather be right than President or Emperor of the best star in the universe. A glorious sentiment, Zachary! Ah, dear; I wish Ihad acted up to it in my little day on earth. I should be in much better spirits this very hour, I assure you. ' That all-grasping, guilty ambition of mine was a terrible curse, both to me and to Rome. Candidly, now, General, don't you think it would have been far bet- ter for the world, if I had never been born? Tay. The Lord saw fit to send you here, Julius, and that I consider a sufficient answer to your ques- tion. Ces. A most soldier-like one, certainly. Tay. TrWhy he permitted you to raise the old boy, as you did, is another matter. But I've no doubt the mystery will be cleared up, all in good time. I'm but a novice yet in things spiritual, and should rather seek light from you on these points, than venture on any opinion of my own. But be that as it may, I can't help liking you, anyhow, Caesar, with all your imperfections. Ces. Ditto, ditto, with all my soul! res, I was quite in love with you, Zachary, at the very first blush. And so I was telling our earthly friend, here, before you came, while studying that tip-top bust of yours. Humbug apart, I consider it worth  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC8093-00000114"/> 228     SPIRITUAL .VISITORS. a journey across a score of milky-ways, to shake such an honest old fellow by the hand. Tay. Well, it certainly is most gratifying, to be talked to in this style, by so illustrious a spectre;. so, so- Ctes. Brilliant alike in the boudoir and in the cabinet, on the stump and in the field. That's what you were going to say, General, is it not? Tay. Precisely; only you have put it in as many words as I should have used sentences. I was go- ing to add, however, by one whom I can't help think- ing (asking Plutarch's pardon), a far greater com- mander than Alexander himself. CGus. Inter nos, Zachary, I don't think much of Plutarch. Tay. I'm sorry to hear you say that. Why so? Ces. Oh, he's such a superstitious, sentimental old twaddler. And, then, so inaccurate, and, above all, so full of his Grecian prejudices! Confound the fellow; do you know that he actually accuses' me, in that lie of a life of his, of cutting a million of men to pieces, in my time? I was bad enough, heaven knows; but not quite such a wretch as that comes to. Tay. I remember the passage. I dropped a cypher, mentally, when I read it, as being probably   gi-          SPIRITUAI3 VISITORS.     229 nearer the- truth; and, as you say, bad enough at that. Caes. Too true, too true; and yet I can't help regretting, now and then, General, that I hadn't a little of your flying artillery with me, in Gaul. 1 should have dearly loved to have given Ambio- rix, and Vercingetorix, and the rest of those Gallic rascals, an occasional shower of that same grape that you threw in, to such purpose, among those trumpet-blowing Mexicans; eh, Zach? Tay. Fie, fie, Julius; don't talk so. These are no themes to be trifled with. I say again, you made quite havoc enough, in your day, without resorting to the murderous contrivances of moderns times.- That one affair with the Nervii, alone; what a terri- ble, terrible day's work that was! ,Think of those sixty thousand brave fellows, that bit the - dust be- tween sun and sun! Fighting for their own fire- sides, too, at that! Bad, bad business, Cmsear! I almost wished, when I first read about it, that you had shared their fate: but perhaps another cypher ought to be dropped here, too; how is it? Cces. No, no; the statement is quite too correct. You'll find the same figures in my Commentaries. W. the Elder. Here is the volume, right by, if you would like to refer to it. Cms. Never mind, nevelr mind, old gentleman.   &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC8093-00000115"/> 230     SPIRITUAL- VISITORS. [After a short pause.] Yes, yes, take it for all in all, that was the hardest day's fight, and the narrowest escape, that I ever had. The old Tenth, too; Jove bless 'em; how they covered themselves with glory on that day. Your own Kentucky volunteers, Gen- eral, couldn't have done greater wonders. Tay. As a mere specimen of pluck, I grant you, it was a-brilliant affair; the prettiest thing you did, perhaps, in all your Gallic campaigns; unless the putting up of that famous bridge- W. the Elder. Oh, General, don't speak of that infernal bridge, if you please. It recalls altogether too many sound thrashings, I assure you. Cces. Thrashings! what does the old gentleman mean by that? You smile, General. What is the mystery? Explain, explain. Tay. You are not aware, then, Caesar, it seems, that these same Commentaries of yours have, for many centuries, been a text-book in our schools? Cves. Indeed! You surprise me. Tay. Even so; and that same passage, wherein the construction of -the aforesaid bridge is described, being a right down tough one, has -caused a great many lazy boys a great many severe whippings. I've had a taste of the hickory, myself, more than once, on that score. COcs. Ah! that's it, is it? I am heartily sorry   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      231 that I should have been the cause of any such suffer- ing on your part, General; or on that of our old friend, here. So much for being a Classic! Tay. Oh, don't mention it, Caesar. I believe in thrashing, myself. Boys need it as much as grain; depend upon it. C s. [Aside to Tay.] But what a queer old customer this seems to be of ours! Tay. An eccentric person, very.  Speak out, landlord; there is evidently something on the tip of your tongue, that you want to get rid of. W. the Elder. An absurd fancy, nothing more. This old noddle of mine is quite too full of them. Ctes. Out with it, now; out with it. W. the Elder. Oh, I was only thinking what a tremendous army Caesar would now be commanding, this very day, could he get together all the indi- viduals that have been flogged on his account. All Gaul would hardly hold them. And were he to add thereto, all the negroes, dogs, and horses, that have s been christened after him, he might prescribe terms to the Holy Alliance itself. Cces. Well, this is fame, with a vengeance! But isn't our old friend here, quizzing, General? Tay. Not at all. He speaks within bounds. I myself left at least a score of Caesars in my service, when I died. Yes, Julius, I have straddled Caesars,  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC8093-00000116"/> 232     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. hunted with Caesars, been shaved by Caesars. Both you and Pompey have been amazingly useful to me, all my life, in the way of blacking my boots, driving my teams, getting in my sugar crops, etc., etc. But we are frivolous. To revert to Plutarch.- I was right down sorry, my friend, to hear you speak of him in the way you did. He always struck me as being a most amiable old philosopher and moralist; and I think that's his reputation amongst most read- ers. At any rate, he has made many a long day seem short to me, in camp and on the frontier, with those lively biographies of his. Common gratitude, therefore, will not allow me to say anything disre-- spectful to his memory. Cess. My dear General, had I known that-- Tay. Never mind, never mind. He certainly has not done you justice, however. W. the Elder. No, indeed; the theme was alto- gether beyond his powers. Ah, your Highness, if we only had your autobiography, now ; that woutld have been a volume for the auctioneers to keep knocking down by the tens of thousands! Isn't there such a work somewhere, hid away under one of those seven hills of yours? If so, pray let us into the secret. I should make a fortune by it in less than no time. Are you sure you didn't write   SPIRITUAL' VISITORS.     233 such a book, and stow it away in some place that has never been fSund out? Ces. Indeed indeed, my old firiend, I did not. I fully intended to have done so, however, had I lived. Confound those rascally assassins, they caused me a world of disappointments! Tay. By the way, Caesar, have you seen much of Brutus, since that affair? Ces. A good deal. Tay. And did he explain it all to your satisfac- tion? Cess. Perfectly, perfectly. A glorious fellow, Zach! No loftier spirit ever breathed on earth. As to the other conspirators, however, they were a mis- erable set of wretches. Tay. What, not Cassius? Cces. Well, I never had much faith in his integ- rity. A bitter creature, General, and a frightfully mercenary one ; and as for the rest, they were little better than mere money-murderers. Tay. While I think of it, Caesar, I should like to ask you a question or two, on points that some- what interest me. Caes. Name them, name them, my dear friend. Tay. Well, then, suppose you had lived out your days, and died quietly in your bed, how would things probably have gone? How would your own career,  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC8093-00000117"/> 234'     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. and that of Rome, nay, of the world, have been affected by it? What were your Clans and feelings, at the time that you were thus cruelly taken off? I confess I should like to have some explanations on these points, if agreeable to you. Ctes. Your questions, General, are certainly some- what difficult and embarrassing; especially when we reflect how deceitful all hearts, how doubtful all futures, have ever been on earth. I will endeavor to answer them, however, and honestly. That I had. a foolish, guilty passion for the name and power of King, I may not pretend to deny. The evidence is overwhelming against me on that point. Yes, I should have left no stone unturned, to have secured the throne. Well, suppose the people had snc- cumbed, the conspirators been thwarted, and the coronation had duly taken place. how would King Julius I. have behaved himself? That's the ques- tion. Well, if I know myself at all, Zachary, I should have been guilty of no small acts of mean- ness or of treachery, (verbearing and imperious I should have been, undouhtedly; but as for staining my name with any oi those deeds of beastly de- bauchery and diabolic cruelty, that have made for- ever infamous some of my descendants (I am sure, nmy dear friend, you will believe me), I was utterly incapable of tleln. That I should have undertaken   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     235 to enlarge my Parthian and German acquisitions, and have made more Gallic conquests, and invaded Britain again, it is of course unnecessary to add. Nor should I have neglected the gentler arts and employments of peace, nor the strengthening and em- bellishing of the imperial city. I had already made arrangements, indeed, for the erection, on a grand scale, of several buildings, both useful and orna- mental; such as a Grain Depot, and Merchants' Exchange) and Custom-House; a new Library on the Esquiline, and a School for Architects, the de- sign of which I furnished myself, and had given to my friend, Servilius, the vedile, the very day before my assassination. A superb theatre, too, hardly inferior in size and elegance to the Colosseum itself; and a Gre- cian Opera House; but, above all, a magnificent Obser- vatory one the Coelian hill. That, my dear General, was quite a hobby of mine--the perfecting of our Roman Astronomy; a subject, indeed, which I had spent a good deal of time and money on, while in Egypt. I had also planned the construction, on im- proved principles, of several new roads in various parts of the empire; some modification, also, in our system of draining and sewerage, a branch of en- gineering, you know, for which we Romans were always famous. The great subject-of Rivers and Harbors, too, occupied my thoughts a good deal, at  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC8093-00000118"/> 286     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. that time; and the founding of a Military Hospital for my brave old legionaries. I had actually made arrangements for laying the corner-stone of this last structure, in person, and with appropriate ceremo- nies, on the very morning of my taking off. But I must not weary you, General, with all these details. Tay., Not at all, not at all; go on. I am quito interested, I assure you. Cors. Well, I might add, that the subject of the Currency was one in which I was also deeply inter- ested. Some six months before my exodus from the flesh, I had drawn up and submitted to my friend, Dolabella, the plan of a grand National Bank, both of circulation and discount, with a capital of twenty- five millions of sestertia, and branches, of course, all overthe empire. D. approved of it, I remember, with some slight modifications, and was, in fact, to have been its first President. Antony, too, liked the idea, and would, no doubt; have been a leading Stockholder. There was another matter, too, Zach- ary, that I had quite at heart. Tay. Ah, what was that? Coes. The improvement and enlargement of our Common School System. Tay. .The deuce you had! Why, Julius, your brain seems to have been perfectly crowded with   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     237 grand and noble ideas. What a pity, what a pity that you had no opportunity to carry them out! Cces. Well, I was certain, General, after the above statements, that you would give me credit for some good intentions, at least. But there was another thought, still grander and nobler, my friend, that crossed my mind occasionally; though, I confess, I doubt whether I should have ever had moral courage enough to have acted up to it; if, indeed, it had been at all practicable. Tay. And what thought may that have been? Ces. That of voluntarily resigning, after a few brief years of -prosperous rule, the imperial crown and purple, and of recommending to the Senate and People, the reorganization of our glorious republic, on newer and better principles. Yes, Zachary; a republic somewhat like your own, though, of course, far, far inferior to it, as a piece of legislative work- manship. Tay. What! a federa, government, based on rep- resentation, and with a written Constitution? You amaze me. Cces. Even so; as I said before, however, I fear I should hardly have had magnanimity enough to carry out the idea, when the time came. But sup- pose it had been so, my friend, and the people had accepted the proposition, and perhaps have chosen  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC8093-00000119"/> 238     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. me for their first President-wouldn't it have been glorious? How it would have read in history! Ju- lius Caesar, first President of the United States of Italy! After a term or two, perhaps, of peaceful and beneficent government, under the Constitution, to have retired and spent the evening of my days in quiet, and have died, at last, placidly in -my bed, and with an approving conscience, as you did, my friend, and have been followed to the tomb by millions of loving, weeping countrymen! Ah, dear, on how much pleasanter a footing should I have then stood with posterity! How different, probably, would have been the fate of dear Rome, too; nay, as you said, of the whole world itself? Tay. Would to heaven that it had been so de. creed! -But really, Julius, had you matured this same idea of yours, so far, as your remarks would seem to imply? And, pray, how was the Executive Department of your government to have been organ- ized? Would you have had a corps of Constitu- tional advisers about you, or would you have -been your own Cabinet  Between ourselves, my friend, that was altogether the most trying part of my whole public life, the selection of that same Cabinet. I would rather have fought twenty Buena Vistas over again, than to have had a second one to con- struct.   I- j          SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     239  Ces. Ah, you were too honest for your own good. That was your trouble. If you had been more of a rogue, Zachary, I have no doubt you'd have been in the body this very hout. But to reply to your ques- tion; I should have had a Cabinet, by all means; nay, I had even gone so far as to pitch upon the persons who were to compose it. T'ay. Ah, who were they, who were they? Coas. Well, Brutus, of course, would have been Secretary of State, Dolabella, of the Treasury, Sul- pitius Rufus, of the Interior. Antony, dissolute dog that he was, I'm afraid I should have had to have made Secretary of the Navy, while Calenus would have presided over the War Department. As for the Attorney General-but, holloa! what's our old host so busy about? Tay. Why, the old gentleman seems to be taking notes right smart. W. the Elder. To be sure I am. Do you sup- pose I am going to let such startling disclosures as these go unrecorded? No, indeed-posterity must and shall be informed of all these things. But re- ally, Caesar, I must say that I have been a good deal startled, I might add bewildered by some of your statements. I had not the remotest idea that such things as Banks and Bank Notes, were known to you classical boys, any more than penny papers; or  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC8093-00000120"/> 240 K    SPIRITUAL VISITORS. that you were familiar with telescopes, or lorgnettes, or librettos. CGas. And yet, my aged friend, I am giving you -the naked, unvarnished facts. Tay. But, come, Julius; if we're going to see that Washington Exhibition, I was speaking to you about, it's high time we were off, Daylight is going fast. Cess. True, true; "I wouldn't miss it for worlds. Tay. And suppose we get our old friend here to act as cicerone? W. the Elder. I am quite unworthy of such an honor. You'll be delighted with the pictures, though, I'm sure. Tay. I am told that there are no less than a dozen heads of the Pater Patris there, and all by artists of note. W. the Elder. Even so; heads by Stuart, Pine, Wertmuller, Cerrachi, Houdon, Powers, and others; to say nothing of Leutze's magnificent composition, the Crossing of the Rubicon. Tay. What, what, what? W. the Elder. Pshaw; I'm always making such blunders,-Delaware, I should have said. - Cs. I'm afraid, my old boy, that was meant for a sly cut at me, if the truth were-known. W. the Elder. Oh, how can you?   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     241 Cces. No matter; I deserve it. In fact, General, I almost shrink from being confronted with the great patriot. The contrast in our careers here below, was so painfully marked, that- Tay. Oh, don't be so squeamish. Besides, you'll find plenty of other attractions there. Will he not, landlord? W. the Elder. Yes, indeed; quite an assortment of fancy pieces, and some glorious landscapes- Gignoux's Seasons among the rest; and, above all, the ever-charming Course of Empire. Ces. Indeed! I was somewhat of a landscape painter myself, in my early days. ! Tay. What were you not, Caesar?  Poet, wit, fine gentleman, orator, statesman, warrior; and, moreover, unless Suetonius belies you, a terrible fellow among the girls. Ces. Well, I was somewhat of a pet among the petticoats, it must be confessed. o Tay. A sad dog, I fear. Caesar, allow me to ask you one plain question. CacS. Certainly. Tay. Suppose, now, after this same imaginary coronation of yours, that you have had so much to say about, that that wicked and bewitching syren, Cleopatra, had come over to your Court, would you have had the courage to turn your back on all her  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC8093-00000121"/> 242      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. fascinations? Would you have been a faithful hus- band to your loving Queen, Calpurnia , I fear not. Ces. Well, well, General, those were wicked times; there's no denying that. I was surrounded by pretty hard characters during most of my stay on earth. But, oh, what a comfort it is to know that all these things have changed, since! Tay. Rather sarcastic, Csesar, that last remark. But come, let's be off. I shall insist, however, on our old host's accompanying us. W. the Elder. As you will, Commanders. Caes. Bene, andiamo.

Do you really mean to say, then, that you still harbor, ate the distance of more than twenty centuries, the same horrible feelings that you died with?

You' had far better be minding your own little earthly business, let me tell you. -- The idea of a shallow mortal's pre- tending to comprehend spiritual experiences, or to measure their duration by the paltry time-pieces of earth! Bah! W. the Elder. Well, well, old rapper and tipper, you needn't be so infernally crusty about it. I meant no offence. Tim. Who cares whether you did or not? But where is this same waggish spectre, whom you con- sider such valuable company! Is this the way he keeps his appointments'? j W. the Elder. Well, he certainly ought to have whizzed in sight before this time. Holloa, by Jupi- ter, there he is now. [Enter Swift.] Ah, my dear brother Jonathan, I am delighted to see you. I was afraid you were going to give us the slip. Swift. Brother Jonathan? What do you mean by that? Do you take me for a yankee? W. the Elder. Well, what do they call you in spirit-land? Doctor, Dean, Lemuel, Yahoo, per- haps; eh, old fellow, how is it?   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      247 Swift. You are mighty familiar on short acquaint- ance, I must say. But who, in the name of Hera- clitus, is that old sour-krout? Of all the vinegar- visaged ghosts that ever set schoolboys scampering, he certainly bears the bell. Who is he-who is he? 'W. the Elder. Quite an historical character, let me tell you. Swift. I dare say; but who, who? W. the Elder. A famous giver of good dinners, in his day. But he overdid the thing, poor fellow, got cornered, had to sell out his Athenian Fancy Stocks, at a frightful sacrifice, hoisted the red flag; in short, Doctor, the old story. Swift. Yes; but you haven't told me who he is, all this time. W. the Elder. And instead of facing it like a man, or turning Diddler, in self-defence, fell to curs- ing, made for the woods, peeled off his garments, and went about, for the balance of his stay on earth, in naturalibus, and blaspheming every man, or beast, that came within bow-shot of him. Swift. Come, come, what nonsense is this, and why do you tease me in this impertinent style? If you don't introduce me forthwith, I'm off; that's all. W. the Elder.

Timon of Athens? You don't tell me so. W. the Elder. Even so; the mighty monarch of misanthropes; he, whose magnificent imprecations will live and glow, through all time, in the pages of the divine bard; whose epitaph will be shuddered over, while a grave is left to dig on earth. Swift. Well, you needn't be so grandiloquent about it. Come, come, introduce me. W. the Elder. Allow me, dear Timon, to make you acquainted with that most exemplary friend and pitcher of a 'ghost, Jonathan Swift, Ex-Dean of St. Patrick's, and author of the famous Drapier Let- ters, The Tale of a Tub, Gulliver's Travels, and other pious volumes; composer, moreover, of some of the very finest, perpetrator of some of the very filthiest verses in our language;-  Swift.

'I say, old fellow, I'm right glad to see you. -How are you-how have you been? Tim. You be hanged! W. the Elder. Timon, Timon; do be civil. Tim. I shall do no such thing. I don't like his looks. I never saw a worse eye in a head in all my spiritual days. W. the Elder. But he's my guest, remember. Come, come, now, Timon; do forget yourself, for once, and be decent; that's a good ghost. Tim. Well, well, as you will. What have I got pleasant to say, though? I'm no company for any body; no, and never shall be again, I fear, through all eternity. W. the Elder. Why, what a sigh was there! Cheer up, cheer up, old boy. Come, brother Swift, can't you manage to make yourself agreeable to our old Athenian friend, here? Suppose you preach us a sermon, now, by way of a change. You used to be a good deal of a wag, you know, in your time, both in and out of the pulpit. Swift. Why, you profane old wretch! I joke in the pulpit?

Sir Walter throws out the same idea, too. Swift. Well, perhaps I was somewhat flippant and frivolous, at times; but I hadn't so bad a heart, after all, as some of my traducers have ascribed to me. But that's neither here nor there. Come, bro- ther Athenian, and King of good haters, do brighten up. You actually look as if you had been dining on unripe persimmons, for the last fifty centuries, and washing them down with red ink. Surely you must have a bit of spiritual news to tell a ghost. Tim.

At what point did you cross the ecliptic, if it is a fair question? Tim. Bah, how should I know? All I remem- ber, is that when your infernal planet hove in sight, I naturally made for Athens, of course, and from there, blundered along, as best I could, to this dust- hole of a town of yours. W. the Elder. But why didn't you come direct to Gotham? Tim. Gotham? What the deuce did I know about Gotham? Wasn't all America, terra incog- nita, when I had the dyspepsia on earth? W. the Elder.

It did your bitter old soul good, didn't it, to behold such a complete realization of all your maledictions? Tim. It certainly was gratifying; though not so much so as I expected. W. the Elder.

Swift. To be candid with you, not overmuch. The old country for me, ghost or mortal. W. the Elder. But, surely, you see something agreeable and commendable in our manners and institutions; some bona fide improvements, do you not? Swift. Precious few, old fellow. W. the Elder. What, not in our unterrified de- mocracy-our universal suffrage-our voluntary system-our- Swift. Oh, you needn't run over the list; I con- sider them, one and all, mere high-sounding hum- bugs, that will never stand the test of time, or of a crowded population.

No language can express its caprices. As to your scenery, I have been most fearfully disappointed in it. There are some pretty girls scattered about, I confess; and here and there a healthy, well-developed oyster. W. the Elder. You do condescend, then, to ad- mire our shell-fish, -do you? [Aside.] The old crab. Awift. -Yes, your oysters are as good as your manners are bad. W. the Elder. What? Swift. I repeat it. Wherever I have been, I have found a very low style of manners, alike in the so- cial circle, the sanctuary, the parliament, and the halls of justice. Nine-tenths of your young men, that I have seen, have been swaggering and dissi- pated; and of your young women, hoydenish and extravagant; while the old people have, almost inva- riably, been thrust aside,. like so much cracked crockery, or broken down furniture. There is a ter- rible lack of reverence among you; ay, and of truly reverend objects. Nobody seems to look up to any- body, -or anything. Dollars and cents-dollars and   -        SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      255 cents; they are, at once, your peerage, your art, your science, your religion. W. the Elder. You atrocious --old libeller what do you mean? You'll be saying next that Niagara is a humbug. Swift. I don't see much in it;-a good enough cascade for unwashed democrats; but the scenery about it is terribly flat and insipid. W. the Elder. What the deuce would you have there? Mont Blanc? Hot absurdly you talk, doc- tor! As if mountain scenerywouldn't only injure the effect! What other arrangement could half so well set off the beauty and majesty of the cataract? Ah, you're evidently bilious, Dean, and out of hu- mor; or perhaps you haven't been received with that eclat, that you think was due to your genius. Swift. Oh, no, no; I have been pretty well re- ceived upon the whole. W. the Elder. Something sticks in your crop, I'm sure. Somebody has been giving you a rap over the knuckles. Is it not so? Swift. Not at all, not at all. To be sure, I heard some pretty plain talk about myself, a few evenings since. W. the Elder. Ah! Swift.

Ah, that's the worst of it. It was no yankee, but a countryman of my own, confound him; let's see-what the deuce was his name? Whack- Whack- Whack-away; an individual who has been going about, lecturing in these parts, of late. You must know all about him, surely. W. the Elder. Whack-away? Poh, poh; you mean Thackeray. He does whack away, sure enough, and in magnificent style, too, at the follies and vices of his brethren. Thackeray, Thackeray; a large ruddy man, with a white head, and specta- cles, standing some" seven feet six, in his stockings? No! Swift. The very fellow, and be hanged to him! W. the Elder. A capital lecture, that, Doctor. Swift. You heard the libel, did you?  W. the Elder. To be sure I did, and wouldn't have missed it for a good deal. Rather hard on you, old boy, though, I must say; and as it struck me, most unreasonably, savagely so. ax    Swift. Curse his impudence! Why, he wouldn't it'r   allow me a solitary virtue; no, not even that of filial piety; whereas, Heaven knows, if I was no- thing else, I was, at least, a good son. W. the Elder. You were so, Doctor; and more than that,-you gave away a large part of your in- come in charity every year, if I remember rightly. Swift. Indeed I did. W. the Elder. Oh, well; perhaps the lecturer, if the truth were known, had a little lurking jeal- ousy of your superior reputation and vigor, as a satirist. He certainly spoke most handsomely, though, of some of your contemporaries, Doctor: and, above all, of Fielding. A most delicious tri- bute, that. I could have hugged him for it. Swift. What, Harry Fielding? A broth of a boy, wasn't he? W. the Elder. One of the most glorious geniuses God ever sent to bless the earth. Swift. And yet, do you know, that when I ven- tured to introduce his name at a recent spiritual man- ifestation, nearly every mortal present protested against him, as altogether too gross a writer for this pure and enlightened age.

Come, now, give us a little of your spiritual experience; that's a dear spectre. John S. Well, you are a free and easy old fellow, I must say; but what in the name of aged Nicholas do you want any of my yarns for? Why am I here at all, anyhow? Whatis the reason of the present invocation?

And then again, between ourselves, I can't help doubting whether such a performance, however well done, would begin to pay expenses. John S. I suppose not. I'm altogether too much of a fogie, and fighting character, to go down, in these days. Is it not so  W. the Elder. No, that's not it; but somehow or other, there don't seem to be a rage, just now, for the lives of great benefactors. Washington him- self, rather drags in the market, I'm told. John S.

Why take me up so fiercely? I was only half in earnest, I assure you. I do not pretend to deny the progress of your nation in all these fine things, or to ignore the existence of all these bright boys, that you have just named; wits, artists, poets, essayists.

But meanwhile, old gentleman, I must and will say, that there are a great many things in this broad land of yours, that I don't like at all; yes, follies, vices, crimes, that call for all the lashing of the satirist, all the thun- ders of the pulpit.

And, as you insist upon it, I will glance at them for a moment.     ,Imprimis, then; you are always in such an infernal hurry, all of you, and about everything, that there's no comfort, either for ghost or mortal, among you. You don't stop to doanything right; either to eat, or drink, or cook, or build, or plant, or paint, or . write, or legislate, like Christians. You can't wait, either to season your timber, or to test your iron; no, nor even to put steeples on your churches. You are always rushing after results, before their time; always anticipating your debts, and your crops, and disposing of your fruits, before they have fairly shown their blossoms; hurrying, hurrying to get rich, sacrificing thereto, a11 the proprieties and cour- tesies of life. If you knock a fellow down, or run over him, as you do continually, you've no time to apologise, much less to pick him up. In doors, or out of doors, it makes no difference; everywhere , the same mad race with "time. As to ever sitting  - out concert, play, or sermon, to the end, and then re- tiring in tranquil dignity, you never think of such a , thing, but rush for the door, males and females alike, with a velocity, and want of decency truly porcine.  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC8093-00000138"/> 276      SPIRITUAL VISITORS.

You may boast of your freedom, indeed, but are you not virtually at the mercy of a set of ruffians, who murder you by scores, every week almost, on all the rivers and rail- roads of your land? Is it not horrible, to think of the impunity, with which these wretches ply their murderous trade, in your midst; escaping almost in- variably, with a mere nominal investigation into their enormities? To think, too, of the ease with which any unpalatable statute may be evaded by the rich transgressor; of the terrible power everywhere wielded, the abject homage everywhere paid to Mammon among you?

Lucian. Welcome to America, Charles. W. the Elder. But, Elia dear, what kept you so? I began to give you up. Lamb. Well, I suppose I must attribute the de- lay, partially to your own rascally handwriting; and partially to my own still more rascally geography. I never was much of a traveler, you know, either.

Yes; I intend to spend the entire day and evening with you. -W. the Elder. Day and evening? Lamb. Not another minute can I spare, my old friend, so there's no use in talking about it.

Not for the journey, however; as I said be- fore, I'm no traveler; but, to tell the honest truth, I needed a change. W. the Elder. How? Lamb. Yes, for, inter nos, and in the strictest confidence, I was right down tired of playing angel. Lucian. Fie, fie, Charles, how can you talk so? Lamb. The confession is a disgraceful one, I ad- mit, and of course must go no farther; but so it is, dear friends, so it is. Yes, many times, of late, and in the very heyday, of the heavenly festivities, have my unworthy thoughts wandered back, to the roast beef and plum-pudding of earth; have re- called, with guilty fondness, its old pipes and pots; have been wicked enough (shame .on them for it), to prefer its dear old Wednesday evenings, to all the sunshine, and music, and flowers around me. But bless me, what is it that smells so savory? Pig, pig, as I'm a sinner. W. the Elder. To be sure it is. Do you sup- pose that I would ask you to my house, and not have your own pet dish on the table? - No, indeed.

So say I; of all branches of learning, the most stupid and unsatisfactory.. Lamb. Yes, and then these antiquaries lie so re- morselessly. Lucian. To be sure they do; and if there's any- thing under heaven that wounds your sensitive na- ture, Charles, more than another, it is this same dis- position to equivocate, and mystify, even in jest. Lamb. It is; indeed. Besides, my dear host, don't it stand to reason, that a vice so important and delightful, must have been among the very ear- liest discoveries? It's as old as Ararat, depend upon it. W. the Elder. If you say so, Elia, I'm satisfied; at the same time, never having read about any such thing, in any of the old books, or having seen any pipes in the mouths of the figures in the old fres- coes, or in the Pompeian or Herculanean collections; finding no such article, either, in brother Abbott's famous Egyptian gallery, or any mention made  J u  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC8093-00000143"/> SPIRITUAL, VISITORS.          l thereof, in the accounts of the recent Nineveh dig- gings, is it at all strange, my friend, that I should have expressed some little surprise, on the occasion?

But, my dear Yankee admirer, to change the subject, you seem to have very snug, pleasant little quarters here. W. the Elder. A mere nutshell of a place. Lamb.

Dialogues of the Dead ; that's all right enough; Chit-Chat -of the Gods; so is- that, though not exactly the   a title I gave it; and so on; but then, again, I see no indications whatever, in the Index, of other of my works, and, above all, of either of my famous mas- terpieces.

Not an infidel production, I hope, old fellow; nothing in the style of Volney's Ruins, eh?. W. the Elder. Volney's fiddlesticks! Lamb. Why, how the deuce should I know? I took it for granted, from the title, that it was the de- scription of some old dead city on the Ganges, or the Ranicocus, or the Oregon, may be. W. the Elder. No dead city, nor on the Ganges, Charles ; but a live and kicking one, on the Merri- mack; and it means to kick, too, harder and harder, every year, tariff or no tariff, for a good many centu- ries to come, I can tell you.

Oh, I can't stop for that now. Besides, what signifies it to me? If I'm ever in any doubt about the text, haven't I the dear bard himself, to consult? W. the Elder. True, true.

Lamb. Indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. W. the Elder. Not but what we have, here and there, an actor of rare gifts, and truly Shaksperian conceptions ; at the same time, there is not a com- pany in all our broad land (and it grieves me to con- fess it, my friend), that can begin to interpret any one of the divine bard's plays, even respectably.

Well, the same business that brings you, I suppose; I come as a delegate to the great River and Harbor Convention, to be held, this bless- ed day, at the embouchure of our young friend, the Hudson. Don't your credentials tell the same story? Father N. Verily, they do. Well, I'm right glad to mingle waters with you, once more.

How are all your tributaries, and why haven't you brought them with you? Father M. Well, mine is a pretty large family, you know. The idea of bringing them all, was quite out of the question; and so, not wishing to make any odious distinctions, I thought it best to come alone. But where are your own branches, grand- sire? Father N. Well, to say truth, I could neither afford to bring them, nor could they conveniently be spared from home. Father M. How is Father Niger's health, this season? Father N. He is very low, I'm sorry to say; his gravel complaint troubles him worse than ever. Father M. Indeed!  I'm right sorry to hear that. You are looking in pretty good case yourself. h   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      301 Father N. Only tolerable. Father M. Ah, what's been the matter? Father N. Well,-general debility; besides, I've had a touch of the strangury, now, more or less, for several summers back, which I needn't tell you, has been a source of a good deal of pain to myself, and of anxiety to Egypt. You were never troubled that way, I believe. Father M. No; my ailments are of a very differ- ent sort. But do tell us, how are the rest of our Oriental brethren? Asia, I suppose, will be pretty fully represented in the Convention? No! Father N. Very fairly; so, at least, old Hoang-    ho told me, yesterday.

But your own paper, so says Father Thames, on the Future of Africa, will be, by all odds, the ablest document submitted to the Convention. Father N. Drown Father Thames!

On the contrary, I look forward to a greatly improved state of trade and navigation, not only in my own waters, but throughout our continent. The main topic, however, of my memorial to the Convention, is the case of old Father Niger. Father M. Ah? Father N. Yes; both the old gentleman, and myself, are beginning to be quite concerned about the affair. 'Twas but a few days since, that he told me he was very anxious to have his troubles laid be- fore the meeting, his ailments inquired into, his : whereabouts explored; in a word, he was dying -to be restored to sound, wholesome, navigable condi-    tion, and to take his proper place among the     i business-rivers of the world; that he was quite tired of flowing through a land of heathens and     cannibals, and longed to see a little culture and commerce on his banks; and so on, and so on.

Well, what I want is this (and. that's the main burden of my song)-to have you Ameri- can rivers lay your heads together in Convention, and bring the matter fairly before Great Father Jonathan. If the other powers choose to cooperate, well and good; still, individually, I should prefer to have neither Asiatic nor European intervention in the matter. I want you yankees to have all the glory 6f this business. Father M. Ah, that's-it, is it; a pretty scheme, certainly. Father M. When this is done (and I consider it an enterprise as much within the means, as it is worthy the ambition, of your nation), there is an- other little affair, likewise, which I would like to have you Western boys help us along with. Father /. And pray, what may that be? Father N. Simply this; the uniting of the two streams by a judicious system of canals; a matter, also, alike feasible and desirable, and which, if wisely carried out, will not only reflect honor on American genius, and bring profit to American capi- tal, but will give new life, new energy, new pros- pects to both our old African ,waters.

Of course, I've no time to enter into details now; especially as I shall have to go over the whole ground, before the Convention; but does not the merest glance convince you, both of the feasibility and  the immense value to Africa, to the world, of an improvement of this nature? * The Editor must here again regret the unpardonable negli- gence of his old friend, in not having procured a copy, or at least i snatched some valuable hints, from the map above mentioned.

I consider that sum a mere flea-bite, for a nation like yours. Father M. Well, perhaps it would be so, if we hadn't sundry other little jobs on hand, and accounts to settle. Father N. Of what nature, may I ask? Father M. Well, in the first place, we've got a good deal of unfinished boundary business to dispose of, which will cost Uncle Samuel a good deal, in the way of dinners and grog bills ; then there's the en- largement of the National Tea-Room; the multi- plication of offices of all sorts, and the doubling of all our outfits and salaries; the purchase of some two or three hundred islands on the Pacific, which are indispensably necessary as outlets for our over- crowded population; islands, of course, which we would vastly prefer stealing to buying, if the other Christian powers would agree to it; then there's   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     807 the annexation of Greenland and Kamschatka, which we all feel to be important, for the putting of our Ice Trade on a firm footing; not to speak of some half dozen more railroads to the Pacific, and some other little items.

And then, again, grandsire, my own claims upon the paternal care of the government, ought to have precedence over all foreign improve- ments. Father N. Unquestionably; but are you not in fine order, my son? I don't mean morally, of course; for I am well aware of the frightful amount of drink- ing, lynching, poker-playing, and boiler-bursting, along your shores; but physically? Father M.

On the contrary, I have been most shamefully neg- lected. However, old patriarch, I like your idea, I must say, amazingly; it is, indeed, a grand one, a cosmopolitan one. The exploration of the Niger, and its redemption from the horrors of barbarism, and its introduction into the great circle of civilized rivers, are truly magnificent undertakings; what nation might not be proud to achieve them, or co- operate therein? Morally, commercially, politi- cally, in every point of viewi, are they worthy of the stateman's profoundest study. I fear, however, my old friend, that the age is not ripe enough yet, by a good many centuries, for any such results. Still, don:t fail to bring the thing before the Convention. What little influence I have there, you may depend upon, I assure you. Father N. But had'nt we better begin to think of flowing that way? Father M. Perhaps we had. W. the Elder.

Per. You surprise me. It is not, then, alto- gether the instrument you would have made it. Pray, may I ask, what were these same fancied de- fects 'thatyou saw in it? Htam. Well, I have already taxed your patience quite too far. Per. Not so; go on, go on. W. the Elder. [aside to Hamilton.] Suppose I just give him a copy of your Life. It would at the same time gratify me, and save you a considerable outlay of breath.  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC8093-00000160"/> 320      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. Ham. [To W. the Elder.] Thank you, thank you, my worthy host, for the suggestion. W. the Elder. [getting  the same from  the library, and presenting it.] Will Pericles allow me to anticipate somewhat, the explanations of my re- vered countryman, by soliciting his acceptance of these volumes? He will there} find all the ques- tions to which he refers, discussed at length. Per. Ah, what's this a; the Life of Hamilton? By his own son, too! Bravo, bravo ; this is a treat. What an admirable likeness, too! I shall be most proud, indeed, my terrestrial friend, to receive such ,a present, I assure you. W. the Elder. I have already had the honor of putting the name of Aristides in a copy of the Federalist, and now to add your own, is- Per. Indeed! You have had a call from my old Greek brother, have you? W. the Elder. Yes, a most charming one. What's more, Chief Justice Jay was with him at the time. Ham. You don't tell me so! What, brother Jay? W. the Elder. Yes, -not three moons ago were they here, and-in those very chairs. I don't know when I have listened to a pleasanter bit of spiritual chit-chat. To be sure, there were one or two dis- cussions of knotty points, in the Law of Planets, that were rather too deep for my poor mortal wits.   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     321 Per. I dare say; but to return to our theme, brother H.; I need not tell you what pleasure and profit I anticipate in the perusal of this record of your thoughts and labors, nor how deeply I rejoice with you in the triumphant refutation of all your doubts and fears, to which this day bears witness. I shall dedicate the very earliest of my ghostly leisure to these volumes. [Music is heard in the street.] Ah, what delicious strains are those? [he goes to the windozo.] And such soldiers, too! A most superb body of men, truly. Who are they, who are they? Ham. Superb, indeed, and as you say, most deli- cious music. Pray, my worthy host, what may all this signify?  W. the Elder. Charming, charming! Per. Yes, but what is it?  W. the Elder. Why, what should it be, but bro- ther Dodworth's band, returning home with the Light Guard, from the Plymouth festival? You've heard no finer music than that, Pericles, I'll venture to say, in any hemisphere of any planet. Per. Dodworth? Plymouth? Be a little more explicit, if you please. Ham. Yes, landlord; and pray what takes our friends to Plymouth at this' season of the year?  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC8093-00000161"/> 822     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. Pilgrim-day in the dog-days? I can't comprehend it, I confess. W. the Elder. Well, you must know that there has been an effort made, this year, to change the time of celebration from debarkation to embarkation-day. We-descendants of Standish don't altogether relish the northeasterly gales that enliven Plymouth in the month of December, and would fain offer our vows at a more genial season. I was about to add, that I thought the move a good one; but that frown on your face, my dear spirit; announces a different opinion. Ham. A very bad move, a very bad move, my friend. I have no patience with such a suggestion. What, sink the Landing in the Embarkation, the greater event in the less, the triumph in the trial, the grand, crowning mercy of Dec. 22nd, the very birth-hour of the nation, in the doubts and fears and heart-sickening partings of the lst of August? I see no propriety whatever, in the change, histori- cal, moral, or poetical. No, no; celebrate both days, if you will, and with rites appropriate and  significant; Heaven knows there are few enough holidays among you; but do not confound them thus, still less, sacrifice the far more eventful, suggestive, glorious of the two, to the other. W. the Elder. You're quite right i and I wonder   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     323 now that our eastern brethren should have been be- trayed into such an error. Will you allow me to communicate your spiritual views to them, on this point? They will receive them as law, undoubtedly. Ham. As you will, old gentleman. I have no wish, though, to dictate on the subject. W. the Elder. And yet, my dear ghost, unseason- able as you may deem the celebration to have been, I have no doubt it would have delighted you to have been present. Not to speak of the other entertain- ments, the splendid oratory of Everett alone, and that brilliant picture he drew of the future of Ame- rica, would have a hundred fold repaid you for your visit. Ham. No doubt, no doubt. The fame of his elo- quence reached my ears long since; and, indeed, Itwas but the other day that I heard brother Web- ster himself, speaking of him, as the American Cicero. W. the Elder. Ah! Is it possible? You have met, then, our illustrious Ham. I have. He ought to know what good speaking is.                o W. the Elder. Being himself an orator without peer. By the way, General, the most magnificent thing I ever heard from him, was a tribute to your  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC8093-00000162"/> 824     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. own genius and virtues. It has found its way al- ready into all the school-books in the land. Ham. I am delighted to hear it. His praise is fame, indeed! But, holloa, what's the matter with our Greek friend here? Brother lawgiver, an obolus for your thoughts. Per. I beg pardon, friends; but to say truth, I was so carried away by that fascinating music, that I had quite lost the run of the conversation. You were speaking of Ham. Daniel Webster. Per. Ah, true, true ; your illustrious compatriot; but recently from earth, is he not? So at least, Colbert told me ; the famous expounder of that Con- stitution, that you have had so much to say about; the same that we met at brother Burke's last recep- tion; no? Ham. The same, the same; and a most magnifi- cent ghost he-is, too. By the way, mine host, while I think of it, how outrageously shabby and ungrate- ful it was, in your countrymen, not to have made him President years ago. I'm perfectly ashamed of them. Per. The old story, the old story. W.-the Elder. It was, indeed, as you say, most shabby in us. Such a want of discernment, too, as well as decency! And we served glorious Harry   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     325 Clay in just the same way. Confound it, it makesv me curse, almost, whenever I think of it. As to that, though, General, I don't believe, between our- selves, that you would have stood the first ghost of a chance, yourself, had you been a candidate at any of our recent elections; no, by George, I don't be- lieve you would have carried a solitary state, out of the one and thirty. Ham. Nor I; possibly little Delaware; no other. Per. Little Delaware? Hant. The same; we call it little, though it would have been a large state, in your old Peloponnesus. W. the Elder. However, dropping politics and personalities, and to return to our Plymouth friends; I really can't help regretting, my illustrious guests, that you didn't happen to be paying your terrestrial visit, some two or three weeks sooner; for besides this same Pilgrim Festival, there have been a vari- ety of interesting celebrations, within that period, at which I should have been most proud of your company. Per. Such as what, my friend? W. the Elder. Well, there were, first and fore- most, the Commencement Exercises at Dartmouth College, including brother Choate's most brilliant of eulogies; then the grand gathering at Yale, the Phi Beta Kappa Frolic at Harvard, the Alpha Phi  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC8093-00000163"/> 326     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. Delta Performances at Middlebury, the Sigma Psi Upsilon Entertainments at Schenectady, the Kappa Gamma-Lambda Recreations at Canajoharie- Per. What, what, what? W. the Elder. But above all, the Inauguration Ceremonies at our magnificent Crystal Palace. What would I not have given, to have had two such august shades as yourselves, present on that occa- sion! Ham. Well, well, my friend, we shall find quite enough to delight and surprise us, as it is ; myself, more especially, as one of the old settlers here. We mustn't forget, though, to see that same palace, bro- ther P.; yes, before another sun sets. Per. By all means. Ham. And our old-host, here, must be the cice- rone. W. the Elder. Most gladly, if you desire it. Ham. We shall insist upon it. By the way, do you happen to have a map of the city handy? Why, it would take me a good week, at least, to hunt up my old haunts here, and to identify the localities. A propos de ca, is the United States Branch Bank anywhere in this neighborhood? W. the Elder. I should rather think not. Ham. Some distance, eh? Well, itfs of no great consequence. What may the Cashier's name be?   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     327 And could you tell me, in round numbers, the amount of government-deposits in the institution, at this present time? W. the Elder. The amount of deposits? Ham. Certainly; why, what's the matter? You surely ought to know something of the finances of the country. What say the last Treasury returns? Never mind the fractions; how much, how much? W. the Elder. Not the first stiver. Ham. Come, come, no humbug. What's the stock selling at, to-day? A good deal above par, of course; No?     -. W. the Elder. Seventy-five cents a share, the last quotations; and very hard to get rid of, at that. Barn. Poh, poh, none of your jokes. W. the Elder. Jokes? I hold quite too much of the article, I assure you, to be joking on the subject. What makes you stare so, General? Why, is it possible that you didn't know, that the National Bank had become an obsolete idea, some time since? What, a ghost of your financial celebrity, so com- pletely to lose the run of our moneyed affairs, here below, since your departure'? You amaze me. Is it possible that Mr. Webster had nothing to say to you, on that subject? Ham. Not a syllable. Come, tell us all about it. W. the Elder. Well, the narrative is rather a long  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC8093-00000164"/> i28     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. ad complicated one, General, and not altogether attering to our common nature; .nor, entre nous, do think it would prove remarkably entertaining to ericles. His was a hard money government, you low. Ham. True; well, well, some other time. Per. You're wrong in one thing, though, my old [end. W. the Elder. Ah, how so? Per. Why, in saying that the governmental and mmercial operations of Greece, in my day, rested tirely on a specie basis: quite the reverse, I as- *e you, Ham. You surprise me, Pericles. W. the Elder. And me also. Why, it was but other day, that I was reading a most emphatic laration to that effect in brother Mitford. Per. I can't help that. I ought to know better n a modern. What's more, let me tell you, we e quite flooded with worthless Bank paper in lens, more than once, too, during my administra- lam. You don't say so. Are you in earnest, my ad? 'er. I am, so help me Hercules! Confound it, a I not a right to speak on this point? Did I when Archon, offer a premium of five talents,   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     329 for the best essay on Currency and the Credit sys-  temrn, and was not the prize duly awarded to my friend I Crito, of Panormus? Nay, did not I myself write a little treatise on Bills, and another on Promisory Notes, which were both received as authorities,     throughout Greece? Ham. I ask ten thousand pardons, my dear friend. I certainly supposed you were quizzing. But these historians are perpetually misleading us, you know. Thucydides himself indulged in an occasional fib, they say. Per. Yes, hang him, he has lied about me, quite fireely.  Ham. Well, well; and so the old Bank has gone    i by the board, has it? Of course, the government     has to employ the State Institutions, as fiscal agents. I W. the Elder. Not a bit of it. Why, General, forgive me for saying so, but how completely and . absurdly behind the age, you are! However, this    i evening, if you have nothing better to do, we'll go over the whole ground. I confess I should very much like to have your opinion, as to the provisions of the Sub-Treasury Act, and also those of the Gen- eral Banking Law of our own State. Ham. Well, if agreeable to Pericles, that arrange- ment would suit me to a T. I should like to look into your tariff, too, and to have a peep at that same  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC8093-00000165"/> 330      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. Fugitive Slave Law, about which brother Webster spoke to me recently, with so much warmth. So, what say you, Pericles? Per. I'm content. As I said --before, I find your American politics, alike instructive and fascinating. Meanwhile, though, I'm for hunting down a few of the metropolitan lions. Ham. True, true; the sun is getting low; so let's be off to the Palace before it's too late. Come, lead on, my old federal friend, if you please. Per. Yes, we have not a moment to spare. W. the Elder. This way, then, my dear ghosts, at your service.         [Exeunt.]   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     331 PHDIAS.-RAPHAEL. Raph. It was rather strange, though, my dear brother of Greece, that we should have met as we did, at this same Washington Exhibition; was it not? - Phid. Well, it would have been, perhaps, in some eras ; but in these times of free and easy spiritual traveling, and intercommunication, is there any thing strange? Nay, are not all the marvels and myste- ries of the Universe fast fading away? We knock about now, you know, from star to star, with as lit- tle ceremony as, mortals did, from town to town, when I was in the body; and certainly with far less annoyance, in the way of passports and custom- houses; eh, brother? Raph. You're right, quite right, my friend. Times have changed amazingly. But, Phidias, you  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC8093-00000166"/> 832     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. flew away in such a hurry, you remember, that I had no opportunity of asking how you were pleased with the pictures. Phid. Yes, I had an engagement at the time, with brother Browne, at Brooklyn. He wanted to :' consult me about some little matters, connected with  his statue of Clinton. An admirable performance, j by the way, Raphael. You mustn't fail to see it before you leave. Raph. I shall be most happy to do so; but, my friend, you haven't answered my question about the paintings. Phid. True, true. Well, I was rather pleased with the Exhibition, on the whole. I should have preferred, of course, to have seen a greater profu- sion of large pictures.; a little more homogeneous- ness, too, in its character, and a somewhat more or- derly arrangement; a more thorough illustration, also, of American history; more of the images of the great Patriot's associates; not to speak of the scanty representation of my own department. Still, as I said before, I was quite gratified; a decidedly creditable display, brother, for a young and hard- working country like this. But what's your own verdict?  I never was much of a ghost for paint- ings, you know. Your criticisms on the collection, -            ,   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     333 now, would be really worth having. You were evi- dently pleased, I see. Raph. I was, indeed, alike delighted and sur- prised, after what I had heard of the condition of art in America. To be sure, as you say, there was a paucity of grand historical works; but I don't know when I have met a more charming collection of cabinet pictures, or of landscapes. Phid. Some good landscapes there, certainly. Raph. Superb, superb. If they are as faithful as they are beautiful, Nature has indeed smiled upon this land. At the moment, however, I -was not so much thinking of those portraying American scenery, as of those others, wherein I saw reflected the features of my own poor, dear Italy. You no- ticed that view of Florence, of course. Phid. I did:; an accurate likeness of the town, is it not? Raph. Admirable, admirable. I could hardly tear myself away from it. Phid. I saw you lingering most abstractedly over it, and did not care to interrupt you; thinking of old times, I suppose. Raph. Even so, my friend. Yes, Phidias, many. a happy day on earth, did that fair scene recall, I assure you. How often, often have I stood on that very spot, gazing with rapture on that same golden  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC8093-00000167"/> 384     SPIRITUAL VISITORSo light of evening, as the painter's skill hath so mar- vellously caught it, streaming through those same old streets, gilding those old towers and that glori- ous dome, smiling its last farewell upon those dainty villas, and the tops of those stately old Appe- nines! What bright dreams have visited me there, what processions of grand and lovely forms have passed before me, what high hopes of renown and immortality have been kindled within me! How often, too, have I held sweet converse there, with my ever beloved Lorenzo, or listened to the melo- dious wisdom of our revered preceptor, Leonardo! Happy, happy days, indeed, which neither my after career on earth, nor all my spiritual experiences since, have ever been able to efface from memory! Phid. Why, brother, you are growing very ro- mantic, all of a sudden. But, candidly, my dear Raphael, apart from these same glowing associa- tions of yours, I must say I didn't see anything so very remarkable in the picture in question. What's more, I wouldn't exchange that noble bust by Hou- don, in the collection, for an acre of- such perform- ances. Raph. How can you talk so, Phidias 2 -, on the contrary, would not give that same glorious picture, for a wilderness of such busts; no, much as I esteem its maker, profoundly as I reverence the   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      335 hero it commemorates. But did you observe the picture directly over the Florence? Phid. A passing glance, merely; Italian scenery also, if I remember rightly. Raph. It was, and a most admirable composition; full of thought, full, of beauty; almost overloaded, indeed, with ornament. I don't know when I have seen a work, every square inch of which was so sug- gestive. Phid. Indeed! I didn't stop to study it. The Course of Empire, by the same artist, impressed me very agreeably, however. Raph. A magnificent series, truly. It alone ought to rescue American art from the flippant criti- cisms of its detractors. What a grand conception! How faithfully, how  heroically worked up, too! What wealth, what harmony of color, also! Cun- ning indeed the hand, and fertile the mind, that have embodied such a sublime history on canvas! Pray tell me, my worthy host, is the artist still living, that hath wrought thus felicitously? If so, I should dearly love to pay my respects to him. W. the Elder. Alas, no; he left us some years since. Raph. Indeed!  Strange that we should not have met in spirit-land, ere this. W. the Elder. I had the honor of a spiritual call  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC8093-00000168"/> 336      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. from him, recently. He expressed the same sur- prise, by the way, to brother Rubens, who also con- descended to honor my humble lodgings. It was indeed ciharming, Raphael, to hear the filial, nay, reverential way in which they both spoke of you. Raph. Far, far before my humble merits, friend. Phid. But tell us, Raphael, how did you like the large picture, by*Leutze, that gives its name to the Exhibition? Rap-h. Well, I was much pleased with it, though I regret to say, I was but little familiar with the event it illustrates. b Phid. What say you, old host? What do you Americans think of it, any how? W. the Elder. Excuse'me, Phidias, but I deci- dedly prefer to play the listener, and not thb critic, in the presence of such masters. Phid. Pshaw, speak out, man; no pseudo mod- esty. W. the Elder. Well, I am   delighted with the work, myself; and I believe the general opinion is, that it is a most spirited, life-like piece; well drawn and colored; true to nature and to history; in short, that it does not fall below the epic dignity of the great and critical event in our annals, that it commemorates. Raph. I've no doubtof it. There's a world of   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     337 expression in it, certainly, and a look of truth. There was another picture, by the way, by the same artist, that I was much pleased with. W. the Elder. What one, may I ask? Raph. Well, here again, the story it tells is a mystery to me, and I must call on you for an expla- nation. The catalogue, if I remember rightly, enti- tles it, Hester Prynne and Little Pearl. There is a female in it, plainly clad, but with some strange embroidery upon her boddice. Her face is lovely, but grief-worn, reminding me strongly of brother Guido's Cenci; only a little more stern, perhaps; her arms are folded about a bright, mischievous looking young child, fancifully dressed, and its head adorned with some of the most brilliantly beautiful flowers that I ever saw. Pray tell me, what is the sad history that lurks underneath it? W. the Elder. If you will allow me, my honored friend, instead of venturing on any blundering ex- planation of my own, I will show you the passage in the book itseif. [Gets and presents the Scarlet Letter.] Raph. [after glancing at the descriptions] True, true. W. the Elder. Rightly to appreciate it, how- ever, you shonld read the whole story. Allow me to beg your acceptance of the volume. I am, in-  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC8093-00000169"/> 338     SPIRITUAL VISITORS. deed, most proud to offer it to you, as the master- piece of one of our most illustrious story-tellers. Raph. I shall be delighted to read it, I assure you. W. the Elder. You'll find it full of gems. By the way, did you notice a picture, in the immediate neighborhood of the one you speak of-a landscape, which, in my poor opinion, is the most vivid and beautiful transcript of our New England mountain scenery, that has yet been made? Raph. What, brother Church's Twilight? W. the Elder. The same. Raph. I did, indeed, and was wonderfully taken with it. There is a finer one of his, however, in your Academy Exhibition; a marine piece; a sunset, most exquisitely composed. Brother Claude him- self might have been proud to have put his initials to it. W. the Elder. [aside.] There's an endorsement for you. Phid. So you've been to the Academy, Raphael? Raph. For a few moments only; long enough, however, to see that there were some capital things there. Bi. the Elder. And the usual overwhelming ma- jority of daubs. Phid. Yes, some most atrocious perpetrations; *t          SPIRITUAL VISITORS.     339 and in my own walk of art, a most beggarly show; what little there was, not bad, certainly; but alto- gether, not enough to overload an ordinary sized tea- tray. What in Juno's name are all your yankee sculptors about, landlord? You surely don't mean to say, that this is a fair exponent of their labors, for the past twelvemonth? W. the Elder. Heaven forbid! Phid. But where are their works? Your Pow- ers', your Crawfords, your Greenoughs; they surely haven't been idle all this while? W. the Elder. Brother Greenough left us but recently, for higher spheres of action. Brothers Powers and Crawford are both right busy on statues and monuments, that, when finished, will run your Athenian productions very hard, let me tell you. Phid. I am rejoiced to hear it. Meanwhile, I see little or no sculpture about me, either in your dwellings, or your public buildings; and as to out- door sculpture, with the exception of the statue of Clinton that I spoke of just now, literally nothing. W. the Elder. Nothing? Oh, you've not been, to the right quarters of the town, Phidias. Phid. Right quarters? humbug. I tell you, there's nothing of the sort, in all this colossal me- tropolis of yours ; unless you are pleased so to deno- minate sundry stray mammoth boots, and wooden  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC8093-00000170"/> 340     SPIRIT UAL VISITORS. Indians, and hideousI mandarins; not to speak of a few gigantic gilt eagles, time-pieces, spectacles, nags' heads, and such like monstrosities. W. the Elder. Boots, Indians, nags' heads? Pshaw! Why, what a stupid cicerone you must have had with you! You surely didn't miss seeing that superb figure, that crowns the cupola of our magnificent palace of justice? Phid. I believe I did see the image you refer to. W. the Elder. Well, and did it not recall to you, most forcibly, your own illustrious goddess of the Parthenon, or the still more glorious Olympian Jove?' Phid. Bah! I ask your pardon, but I must be honest. W. the Elder. Certainly, certainly. I confess, though, that your criticism alike amazes and morti- fies me. I have heard eminent connoisseurs speak of the statue in question, as a conception worthy of Michael. Angelo himself. But our architecture, Phidias, our architecture; that surely makes up for a world of short-comings in the other departments, don't it? Phid. Well, you certainly have most of our fine Greek names among you; Lyceum, Atheneum, Me- lodeon, Parthenon, Minerva Buildings, and so fol- lowing; but there the resemblance stops.   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      341 W. the Elder. Come now, Phidias, you are quite too severe upon us. Our architecture, especially in the business parts of the city, is admitted by all to be really superb. Phid. It is good, I allow. You are erecting some beautiful stores among you. Still, your efforts gen- erally, in this branch, are exceedingly faulty. You are quite too fond of tawdry ornaments, and sham fronts. There is a terrible lack, both of solidity and of expression, in your buildings, and some shameful mixing of orders, at times.  You put up some pretty churches, I admit: all but the steeples; but then you leave no space about them, either for trees or monuments, or even for necessary light and ventilation. That Crystal Palace of yours, too, graceful and beautiful thing that it is; yet how infelicitous is its location! How can a body, or. a ghost, get any satisfactory view of its proportions, wedged in, as it is, by the surrounding buildings? W. the Elder. You're right there, certainly. There is too much truth, too, I -fear, in. your other strictures. We'll improve in time, though, my friend. Phid. I hope so. I don't think the prospects of Art in America, however, are particularly brilliant; no, not in any of its walks. There don't seem {at least to my cursory observation), to be that love,  &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC8093-00000171"/> 342      SPIRITUAL VISITORS. that reverence for it, which can alone lead to heroic efforts after excellence, or great results. A mere passion for display, and for the applause of the mil- lion, I am-sorry to say, appears to me to be the leading motive of all your American performances, alike in things useful and ornamental; the mown- strari digito, and' not that ingrained love of the true, and grand, and beautiful, that made us Greeks such consummate workmen. I may do you injustice, but so it strikes me. Your habits, customs, laws, all seem to favor this propensity too, and to lead to a specious, superficial, perishing splendor, nd not to the grand, and massive, and enduring in/Art. - W. the Elder. You don't think democracy and high art can coexist, then? Phid. Candidly, I do not. What say you, bro- ther Raphael?  Raph. Well, this is a difficult subject, friends. "  I hardly feel competent to discuss it, much less to apply it in the present case, with my very limited knowledge of America and Americans. My observa- tions, however, such as they are, Phidias, I must say, have inclined me to rather different conclusions from those expressed by you. That these good men of the West are a pretty restless set of mortals, very impatient after results, and over-fond of admiration, the most superficial traveler cannot help noticing;   SPIRITUAL VISITORS.      343 but at the same time, my friend, I think I see in- them a far greater sensibility to beauty and gran- deur, and harmony, than you are disposed to allow them; not so much, I grant you, as, you old Athenians were gifted with, but certainly far more than their French or English brethren ever had or will have; yes, far more aptness for, and ap- preciation of, artistic excellence. And then again, how much is there about them, to call out these quali- ties! Nay, how bountiful, in this regard, has their Creator been towards them! What a wide-spread scene of-beauty and fertility has he assigned them for their labors!

The manifesta- tions of that art may differ, indeed, from those of your own Athens, or my, now, alas, poor, broken- hearted Italy ; it may erect no more sumptuous tem- ples or statues to false gods, or people the walls and domes of huge cathedrals with legendary-saints and martyrs; but will it not have a far more noble and ample field for its labors, in the piles that it is to rear to Commerce, and Legislation, and Learning, and Charity, ay, and*to a purer, loftier Faith, than you or I, my friend, ever knew on earth; in the monuments, too, that it is to raise to the heroes and philanthropists of a better and wiser age, than that of Leo or of Pericles?

A more sincere and wholesome protest against the false life and unsocial -tnd- enctes of the times, we have not met with. Charles Lamb might so have breathed out his soul after a five years' residence in this country. Indeed, our author has a mind more kindred with that quaint and gentle moralist, than any American who has written. There is much admirable preaching in this book, which evidently comes from a heart tried by bitter experiences, and which is conveyed in such grotesque wit as to commend it to the most unwilling listener. The truth is, the book is a disguised sermon upon the folly of worldlines, unbelief, and ill-temnper, recited in a thunder-storm of grumbling, with flashes of saturnine humor and quaint i mg'nation illuminating the preacher's queer but earnest face.--0Chriti  &#xD;<pb n="348 (Advertisement) -349 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC8093-00000174"/> *     BOOKS PUB LISHEvL BY JOI N     S TAYOR.

This work reminds us of the "Reveries of a Bachelor," that miuch-read and justly commelnded work of Ike Marvel.

W This is one of the most delightful books we have looked into. There is no mis- taking the source of these "Musings;" theyspring from a kindly heart and an original, refined intellect. To us they seem like the "Reveries" of an old ao, qnaintance (Ike Marvel.)-Morning Star. Rarely have we been treated to so fresh, piquant, and nervous a volume. Every sentence is bold, startling, and replete with vigors and bears the impress of a keen, sensible, and original mind.-Long Island Star This book is something altogether unique in the literary world. One moment it reminds us of Charles-Lamb, then of some other writer who has charmed us; but in the end we are compelled to fall back upon the conviction, that it is de- cidedly original. It is full of the deepest and most wholesome thought, while a vein of the richest humor enthralls you. These "AMusings" muist be the tloughts of a sick chamber-the veritable siftings of no ordinary mind, breaking loose from disease now and then, as a fair struggle is given between the strong mi and n a feeble body. The map who wrote this volume must be well worth knowing, if his identity could be ohce established. To chat with a mind like that, one hlour each day, would be a treat indeed. We have quite set our heart on finding out who the author is. This bears evidence of being his first literary effort; may the rest only equal it.-Peterso8's Ladies' .5ational Magazine.    to. attention has been called to this book, because it has been severeD absed in ccruiln quarters, where every thing which is not radical, or which aces not savor of infidelity and the "Progress" which is identical with an attempt to de- stroy all the institulions of civilizaltion and religion, is habitually condemned. We confess that the title did not much prepossess us in favor of the work; but we must also confess that having once opened it, we very s(owr arrived at the conclu- sion that it is one of the very best books of the day, and that the author, who is unknown to us, is assuredly a man of no ordinary promise. As a specimen of sarcasm and irony, this little book has rarely been excelled. And the author not only thinks soundly and conservatively upon all subjects, but he writes with a vigor and directness which are exceedingly refreshing in this age of nanby panbyi6.n. If there be any fault to find with the author, it is in the severity of his sarcasm and the unsparing manner in which he lashes the follies, and vices, and absurd- ities of the day. But even this is atoned for in the manly and fearless defense of right and of the old-fashioned principles of religion and equity which pervades this book.-New Y-ork Courier ad Enquirer. We noticed at some length and with decided favor, the previous work by this author, the "Musings of an Invalid." The invalid has laid aside his chamber negligee and come forth as quite a stout and eupeptic man. The present work has all the spirit of its predecessor, and a far broader range. It is full of pithy thoughts and sharp sayings. The tone of the book is earnest, and, on the whole, kindly, respectful to all hearty workers, and somewhat savage upon all ambitious theorists.-Christian Inquirer. This new volume is worthy of the reputation acquired by its predecessor, and will considerably increase the public desire to learn the name of the author. He certainly wields his pen with a rare combination of grace and vigor.-Pittsbwrg Satzrday Vizitor. We do not know when we have been more entertained than by the reading ot this book. It came to us unheralded from an anonymous source. We opened it, intending simply to glance at the contents, and if they were attractive, to lay the volume aside for future examination and notice. We had reckoned without our host. The first few sketches completely enchanted us, and we found ourselves spirited along fromn page to page, even to the end. The contents embrace short chapters, the subjects of whici are generally suggested by the doings of the day in large cities. The thoughts are original, and they are expressed in equally original language. Sarcasm is a prominent feature of the book.; sarcasm, too, of the rarest quality. It also abounds in wit and humor of the best quality.- Church's JBizarre, Phil.. The rich field chosen by the author .gives full play to his vigorous and original mind, and piquant or nervous style. Those who have read the "Musings," need not be told that he is just the man to glean and bind up an inimitable sheaf of "Whimsical Fancies." Its perusal will take the frown off the face of " dull care," and thereby cheer and lengthen life, besides communicating many wise, striking, and improvable thoughts.--Binghananpton Denwerat. We are pleased with this book. There is a quaintness about it that is almost unrivalled. The satire is gentlemanly, yet sufficiently pungent; and the oddities are rather more quaint than grotesque. The author has too much feeling to be severe, and too much generosity of soul to misrepresent.-Hartford Daay Courant. This is a very clever book, by an author, whose previous work, mentioned in the title page, has secured for him a favorable reception on this his second ap- pearance. The sketches are lively and spirited, and the reflections have the great recommendation of never being tiresome, as sensible reflections so often are.- r . Y Evening Post. There is a vein of quiet, keen wit running through this book, that holds the reader as by a charm.

The author is evidently an unpracticed writer, but a man of mature thought, who, as he becomes accustomed to the pen, will attract a constantly increasing at- tention from the reading public. He is a little too careless in his thrusts at what he deems the follies and vices of the age; and in his zeal for the truth, sometimes strikes right and left with more vigor than discretion; but in spite of his seeming want of orthodoxy, his heart appears right, and is evidently in his work. The earnestness thus acquired, joined with a caustic humor, and an original and strik- ing faculty of illustration, will cause the book to be widely read, even by those who come more or less under the lash of the writer.

Since the days of John Bunyan, there has not been given to the Christian world so beautiful an allegory as this. Its design is to exhibit the pernicious effects of slander, and surely no one can contemplate this odious offspring of the depraves heart as it appears in this fanciful sketch, without abhorring and despising thl reality. The names of the several characters are significantly chosen, and tilhe grouping is managed with a fine artistic effect. The style comports with thai chaste simplicity which should characterize an allegory, in which time veil should not be so elaborately and closely woven as to hide the modest meiL of truth be. neath -The Independent (New York). A volume, small and quaint, but very clever; and we have read it, every line of it, at a sitting too, and take the pen in hand to suggest to the reader of this tha he go and do likewise. Startled he will be at the title, "Salander and the Dragon,"' but the first page will reveal the story as an allegory, of whichihe great miter of that species of writing need not be ashamed.- The Presbytertan. I regard this volume as one of- the most successful attempts at the Bunyan styleo of allegorical writing I have ever read. A copy camo into my hands not long since, and was read with absorbing interest. then put it into the hands of my oldest child, a girl some ten years of age, and found that it was read by hei with equal avidity, and the characters and delineations well understood-a Very good test, I judge, of the success of the author in the execution of the work. N one - can read "SALAHDsnn" without b ing struck at the unveiling of the true character and the disastrous consequences of Slander. It ought to find a place in every famuly.--ew York OhAi*tan Advocate and  qurnal.   I-   BOOKS PUBLISHED BY JOHN S. TAYOR.   A very ingenious use of the allegory, to illustrate the deformity and eviA of Sp7y Her antid Evy. The excellent lesson is more impressively set forth by this pic. turesque representation than by any didactic essay, and is much more attractive to the reader. The author evinces great skill in the management of the story, and steady pursuit of a high moral aim.-NVeow York Evangedist. An allegory well worth reading. Its object is to illustrate, in all its ( eformity, 81anrder-one of the worst and commonest of the social vices. It is written some. what in the good old Bunyan style-graphic, poetic, convincing. It will put all malicious gossips to their purgations, who can be induced to read it; and if a por. tion of the funds of the American Tract, Bible, and Missionary Societies were ex- pended in a cheap edition of a million copies of so practical a book as this, the money would be put to good account.-New York Mirror. * An allegory, designed to illustrate the danger of uttering or listening to insinu- ations and-scandalous detraction. We are glad to see the hideous deformity of this vice so faithfully exhibited. It requires only to be seen in its true colors, to excite that detestation which will render its exercise disgraceful, and-cause it to be avoided.-.New York Journal of Commerce. "SALANDa"--I1ero is an insinuating title for a book!-Salander!-how it runs in the mind, snaky and salamander-like, as though it were related to some ugly monster! And so it is, while it tells "A Story of the Hartz Prison," truthful enough to be recognized by every one-beautiful enough in grace, and flow, and quaintness of narrative, to fascinate the dullest reader, and yet horrible enough in its characters accessory to the plot to make one shudder that so foul a fiend should ever be imprisoned in a human heart. "Salander, a Story of the Hartz Prison," might have been written by that master allegorist, John Bunyan, to his credit; but, for the credit of our time, it is written by Frederick W. Shelton. It explains fully how Don Officioso imposed, in the name-a forgery-of the Lord Conscienza, upon Goodman, keeper of Hartz Prison, by representing that this Salander-no other than the green monster, Slande,-was sent by Conscienza (conscience) for incarceration in Hartz (the heart's) Prisbn; also how Salander vexed Goodman, until his wife Pryint (pry into it) got into the secret, when off she goes to Bad-Neighborhood, and confidently tePs Mrs. Blab and a host of scandal- mongers that her husband has br(oght home a motwter I This is noised speedily about, laying Goodman and his house under suspicion. To get rid of this, he is obliged to let Salander out of prison, and thus be quit of the imputation of father- ing him. Salander goes forth, cultivates the acquaintance of one Duke d'Envy, and a war is declared upon Goodnaim, a person heretofore in the confidence of all who knew him. During the battles between Salander and his host of ragamuffins and Good- naim-who stoutly defended himself-the Fairweather Guard and Old Friends of the latter forsook him, but Goodnaim triumphed.-The New Yorker. SALANDER AND TIIE DRAGON.-Be not startled by this head-line. It is only the title of a book. and that an allegory, by the Rev. Mr. Shelton, of Huntingdon, L I., a clergyman of the Episcopal Church. Salander is a monster, born of Envy, and his name, without cover, is Slander. Hideous and hateful, his own father is not willing to keep him, but commits him to the custody of another called Goodman, the jailor of the Hartz Prison. The struggle of Salander to get out, the food that he is fed on while in this prison of the leart, the command of Lord Conscienza, that lie shall be kept confined, and no one shall know of his existence; how the jailor finally tells his wife that he has this monster, and she insists on seeing him, and promises never to mention his existence to any one, and keeps her promise for a whole week or so, and then hints it to Mrs. Snapit, and she to Mrs. Tattleby, and she to Mrs. Blab, and she to Mrs. Watovit, and so on till all the neighbors came to see the monster, and how he was finally let loose ;-all this, and more, is painted with exceeding skill. Sa- lander, once at liberty, goes forth to work mischief. He plots the ruin of the catle Gudnaim, and robs Stella, the wife of the baron, of a priceless jewel wh;ch she wore, more precious than any gem which ever adorned the casket of an empress; and when she was robbed, she pined away and died, and a pure and beautiful shaft was erected to her memory by her faithful husband, with this inscription- "She healed the hearts of the sorrowful while living, and broke them when asa   &#xD;<pb n="352 (Advertisement) -353 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC8093-00000176"/> a     BOOKS PUBLISHED     BY JOHN   S.

It is a sermon that ought to be preachoed everywhere. It has a great truth in it.

TAYOR  - ' It affords me pleasure to learn that you are about to re-publish the little work called "THE LILY OF T  VALL ;EY.'"Since the time it was presented to my daugh- ter, by the Rev. Dr. Matheson, of England, it has been a great favorite in my family. It has been read with intense interest by many who have fromn time to time obtained the loan of it. Indeed it has but seldom been at home since its first perusal. I doubt not but all who have read it, will be glad of the opportunity of possessing a copy. The story is notonly natural, but instructtivc, and well calculated to impress upon the mind important-moral and religious lessons. Some portions of the narrative are of the most touching and thrilling character. There is a charmning simplicity pervading the work. 1 feel a strong confldence that you will find an ample sale for the book. It will find its wr" into many families, and be found in the libraries of the Sabbath school.               WILLIAM PAT'ON. OPINIONS OF TirLE PRESS. A very interesting little work of 123 pages. It is a simple, though beautiful, narrative of a young female, some portions of which are of the most pathlletic an affecting character--particularly- designed' for the edification and instruction of young females, and a most excellent work to introduce into Sabbath schools. Its tendency is to kindle the flame of piety in the youthful bosom, to instruct the un- dersanding, and to warm and improve the heart Its intrinsic, t!ough unosten- tatious, merits, should fumish it with a welcome into every family. -Zadis' r Mn   BOOKS PUBLISHED     BY JOHN S. TAYOR.        it This is a neat and very interesting little volume. The narrative throughout will be read with pleasure, and some portions of it with tthrilling interest. The story is natural, anti told in very neat language, and with admirable simplicity, It is not only calculated to please and intcrest the mhiund of the reader. but also to make moral and religious impressions upon the heart. We are well assured, if its merits were generally known, that it would find its way into many families and .Sabbath school libraries, as it is particularly adapted to please and engage the attention of juvenile readers.-fetwdist Protestant, Baltimore. This is a re-publication of a small narrative volume published in England. The narrative is written with beautiful simplicity, possesses a touching interest, and is calculated to leave a salutary impression. It is well fitted for a present by parents or friends to children, and is worthy of a place in Sabbath school libraries.--Chri- tian Intelligencer. THE POOR VICAR. (Translated from the German of Zchokke.) 1 vol. 18mo. Cloth, -  -      .          - -  $0 31 JOURNAL OF A POOR VICAR.-Such is the title of a little work translated from the German of Zschokke, and published by John S. Taylor, 143 Nassau street. This Journal is said to have been the foundation of Goldsmith's Vicar of Wake- field, and certainly it is worthy of germing that celebrated work. The author of "The Journal of a Poor Vicar," is well known as one of the most affecting of that class of German writers, who know so well how to halo humble life with the iris of tender and holy sentiment, and this little work is, perhaps, his most suooessful effort. Nothing can be more beautiful, touching, and puri;ying than the character he has drawn of the Poor Vicar and his two daughters. We defy any one, with a spark of sentiment, to peruse this Journal without shedding tears. It is a wand that exercises the feelings and emotions of the heart, with irresistible potency. We lhave read nothing-not even the Vicar of Wakefield-to equal it. The translator has happily presented the spirit of the original. The volume is neatly published, and whoever fails to reads it, fails of a great and long to be remembered enjoy. ment. THE SHORTER CATECHSM OF THE REV. ASSEMBLY OF DIVINES.

Have our readers read the books named, as having been writ- ten by the author of the work before us? If not, we advise them to delay no longer to purchase and peruse them. Whoever may be the writer, he possesses a rich and fertile imagination, a ripe judgment, and strong reasoning powers. He is ever hopeful, o and in the present casts forth his vision into the future, lives in picturing the character of that future, arrayed in beauty and glory.-American Spectator. We heartily commend "Clouds and Sunshine" to our readers' attention. It will surprise, by its difference from his other works, the admirers of the author, while it gives promise of rapid im- provement in-method, continuity of thought, and power of ex- pression. From the first, we havoe detected beneath the silken doublet of our author the gleam of armor, and we are now glad to welcome into the real battle-field of sober thought, one hither- to known to us only as a graceful skirmisher in the tournament of festive wit and holiday humor.- Christian Inquirer. It is the work of a thinker. and will cause the reader to think. -Nezo. York Euangelist. This work is from the pen of a man of decided genius.---Pwm - tan and Recorder, Boston.   OPINIONS OF    HE PRESS. This volume is filled with six yery sprightly "Conversations"- some of them rising to the dignity of forensic debate; There is an ardor, and vivacity, and suggestive fertility, as well as uncon- trolled imagination about it, which are fitted to break up one's mental monotony, and give a quickening impulse to his faculties. -Christian Mirror, Portland. The writer of this book is, beyond all controversy, a man of genius; his previous productions have secured to him a high re- putation, and this will in no wise detract from it.-Albany Argus. It consists of a series of conversations on the phenomena of life-the bright and dark shades of-the moral world-between the author, who is of a cheerful, sunny, hopeful disposition, and two friends, one of whom is a victim of skepticism and despondency, and the other a believer in revelation, but a disbeliever in the per- fectibility of the human species. No profound or original views are evolved, but a vein of sterling sense runs through the inter- locutions; and to croakers, grumblers, all, in short, whose "brains are lined with black," as old Burton says, and to whom the world revolves in a continual cycle of misery, we commend the discus- sions, as eminently suggestive, and pregnant with rich sources of consolation.- Yankee Blade, Boston. It is delightful to hold communion with a truly philosophical spirit; one which is neither fettered by prescriptive ideas, nor carried away by the speculations of the day. In these material times-not bad times in many respects on that account--.we re- cognize something essentially classical in a character, whose home' is the purely intellectual; who, like Cicero, finds a fasci- nation in the discussion of problems, which never have any charm for the multitude. The author of "' Clouds and Sunshine has -this classic stamp, but still lie is of the age, and with it.-Daily Re- gzster, Philadelphia. The book of a thinker is always valuable to mankind. As such, this volume will commend itself to a large portion of the com- munity.-New York Reformer. A series of conversations between three friends, embodying the phases of life which are indicated by the title, according as the speaker for the time is influenced or opinionated. The impression left is of good-of hope, of trust, and immor- tality. The style in which these conversations are written is compre- hensive, sometimes in a pleasant talkative vein, sometimes with a philosophic earnestness, when the speaker enlarges on the theme  &#xD;<pb n="360 (Advertisement) -361" xml:id="VAC8093-00000180"/> j B         OPINIONS OF THE PRESS. of conversation, but at all times the manner is excellent, pointed, and characteristic. A variety of subjects, and a greater variety of illustrations, drawn from every source, physical and metaphy- -sical, make the book a very charming one.-National Democrat.   CLOUDS AND SUNSHNE.-This is somnething out of the ordinary run. The author, a firm believer in a future state and a sanguine o observer of the present, discusses with unbelieving and melan- choly friends, the subjects of the immortality of the soul, the progress and ultimate perfection of the human race. The style is lively, and the suggestions forcible. Previous works bythe same author, "Musings of an Invalid," "Fancies of a Whimsical Man," etc., have attracted much attention and established his re- putation as one of the best writers of the day.-Utica Gazette. This is the latest production of the author of "Musings of an Invalid," and "Fancies of a Whimsical Man." These books at: tracted much. attention when they first appeared, and were es- teemed by many as not inferior to the writings of Ike Marvel. "Clouds and Sunshine" is written in the happiest vein of the pe- culiar style of the author, and consists of a series of conversa- tions with two of his friends, B. and C., on the mysteries of life. -Norfolk News. This is decidedly one of the most interesting and readable books that we have perused for some time. The author treats the different subjects under discussion in a masterly manner. He, fully aware that infidelity has of late been making rapid progress, has boldly thrown himself into the arena, and taken up arms in defense not only of Christianity, but also of the doctrine of a future material grandeur. To our minds, his arguments in favor of both positions are conclusive. It is writtten in an attrabtive style; indeed, every sentence is bold and energetic, while the rich, quiet vein of refined humor, that occasionally sparkles forth, will give to its perusal a peculiar interest.- The Peoled Paper. CLOUDS AND SUNSHNE.-This is the title of another volume from the pen of the author of "( Musings-of an Invalid," "Fan- cies of .a Whimsical, Man," "Fun and Earnest," and the very popular series of ", Spiritual Dialogues," which have appeared in our pages. It is written in a more thoughtful vein than any - previous work of the author, and presents somne very original views touching the world and the aspirations of man. We look upon it asaltogether the ablest of its author's productions; as des- tined to establish a reputation for him as a close observer, blear thinker, and elegant writer, wi. ch any man living might be prfbud to attain.-- Th7 Bizarre, Philadelhia.  -   &#xD;</p>
