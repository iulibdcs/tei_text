            <p>I PRESENT you with my first book. It is no fiction. The actors described are, or have been, living men and women: some of them still survive; others tenant the narrow house of the dead. Besides, the writing or reading mere fiction would be like sitting by the table, and going through the motions, without having any thing to eat.</p> 
            <p>I am aware that books, like water, will find their level, and upon the great literary ocean I launch my little bark, to buffet the waves of criticism. If wrecked upon the rock of the classic and learned, I hope and honestly trust that it will find a resting-place in the hearts of the million of my countrymen.</p> 
            <p>So far as it is political, I have given no opinion<pb n="vi-vii (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC6184-00000004"/> of my own, but have faithfully endeavored to represent the opinions of others. I have said nothing in extenuation, or set down aught in malice, against any person or party; but if any one, by a perusal of its pages, shall find a picture, in which he has been an actor, true to the letter-as Nathan said unto David-<emph>Thou art the man!</emph>
            </p> 
            <p>I have compressed the interesting details of thirteen years into a short story, hoping not to weary you. Read it: if you do n't like it, let the fault be with</p>

               <p>BRIGHT as a ray of light from the burning mountain, on the deep, dark shades of night; lovely as the view off heaven to a dying man, is the sight of rest to a worn-out, weary traveler. About one dozen years ago, far toward the setting sun, on the border of Missouri, after traversing the plains the live-long day, "I lost every trace of my way, and wandered in the shades of night." When about to give up in despair, and lie down upon the cold, damp earth, with no cover but the canopy of heaven, I fortunately discovered that I was near the plantation of Colonel S--.</p> 
               <p>Go with me, kind reader, to the residence of the Colonel, and we will apply for food and rest. The Colonel is alive to the wants of a stranger. He knows by experience the value of a comfortable bed<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6184-00000008"/> and a warm supper, to one who is tired, cold, wet, and hungry. He has been a long time in the Western country, but in early boyhood received an Eastern education; though somewhat rough in his manners, he is a true gentleman; tall in person, with a muscular frame, and is a true specimen of a live <emph>Border Ruffian</emph>. He is used to camp-life, and has told me of his many skirmishes with the Indians; but I have no time now to relate them.</p> 
               <p>I will now introduce you to one of the most interesting families with whom it has been my fortune to become acquainted in the Western country. Mrs. S-- is a native of the West, and a true type of a gentle countrywoman-affectionate, confiding and faithful; the mother of an only daughter, who (at that time) was about five years of age; possessing the mild, sweet temper of her mother, with the energy and determination of her father. Sweet and beautiful child! The prairie breeze, as it rustles through her golden locks, whispers no tidings of the future. Kind reader, imagine a man of middle age, far removed from his native land, and one whose life has been a thousand times in the most imminent peril-one who has no kindred at hand save an only daughter, and of such an age-and you may form some idea of the embrace with which the Colonel pressed Cora to his heart.</p> 
               <p>Then go with me to the heart of a mother, whose first-born is gamboling beneath the shade of her brow, while her sweet little sister sleeps beneath the dark, green sod. Mark the mother, how closely she watches every movement, and then you have but a faint glimmer of a mother's love.</p> 
               <p>Thirty years prior to the time alluded to, Missouri was admitted into the Union as a slave State. The Colonel, by his marriage with his lady, became the master and owner of a black family of some fourteen persons, or, as they are more familiarly called in Missouri, fourteen "negroes." For the present, I will only speak of Dixie, a mulatto girl, about fifteen years of age, the immediate body servant of Mrs. S--, and nurse of Cora.</p> 
               <p>I was a guest at the house of the Colonel in the beginning of the summer of 1850. Late one evening my attention was called to the unusually quick steps and glaring eyes of Dixie, as she approached her mistress, when the following conversation ensued:</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mrs. S. Where is Cora?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Dixie. She come home, missis.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Mrs. S. You lying spawn, she has not come home; I have been watching the road all the time. Where is she, I say? Tell me, quick!</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Dixie. I-I-I-went to sleep, missis.</p> 
               <p>The mystery was soon revealed. Dixie and Cora had gone off to gather flowers on the prairie. Dixie, true to the custom of her race, had lain down to take a nap, and Cora, in search of the enticing flowers, had wandered off and lost her way.</p> 
               <p>All was bustle and confusion for a time; horses<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6184-00000009"/> were saddled; neighbors were called; I was soon in my saddle; a company of some forty men were soon collected; tin horns paraded, and guns provided; and then a general rendezvous, after which we separated into several parties, agreeing, if either party found the child, the others were to be warned by the firing of guns, blowing of horns, etc.</p> 
               <p>Then, o'er hill and dale, through brush and swamp, we dashed off, each and every one anxious to win the prize. Fields, prairies, and woods were crossed in every direction. I was with a small party, the Colonel being one of our party. We looked into the most intricate places, listening ever and anon for horn or gun. But, alas! no sound disturbed the silent wind. Still, on and on we pursued our course, until the day no longer lent its friendly aid. A dark cloud was gathering in the western horizon; black night was gently drawing her mantle o'er the broad and beautiful prairies. All parties were slowly and sadly returning. The Colonel and I were the last.</p> 
               <p>I shall never forget the looks of that mother! It was now dark, and deathly Still; the storm thick, fast gathering, and on the eve of bursting upon us. The last hope of that mother lingered faintly on our return. I would have given every thing I possessed in the world, to have returned the child to the mother. But fate compelled us to return with empty hands. Who but a mother can fathom the feelings of the heart that beat in the breast of that woman, as she clasped her hands and exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"O, my God! my child is lost!"</p>

               <p>FATAL as the sun-stroke upon a feverish brain, deadly as a poison asp to the bosom of the oriental queen, this unexpected stroke fell upon the joy of a confiding mother. Through the long vigils of the night, the moaning of the mother, the pattering of rain, the low, dead sound of distant thunder, chased away coaxing sleep from dull and heavy eyes. Welcome as the year of jubilee to the Egyptian bondman was the first ray of light that broke upon the eastern horizon. The new day brought new scenes. The Colonel on yesterday showed no lack of nerve; to-day he was sad and inactive. The mother, on the contrary, rose to the duties of her mission, to fill the sphere marked out by Heaven for her sex. Thus it is ever, when man is overcome with grief, and ready to lie down in despair, woman rises up, like a guardian angel, in the last day, to whisper comfort in the ear of the lords of creation. He who has not heard, in the dark hour of trouble, the soft voice of woman, knows not her mission.</p>

               <p>Mrs. S-- lost no time in making every preparation, in fitting out the different parties to start in fresh pursuit of Cora. She also seemed to take into consideration the circumstances under which she was lost. And in the general bustle I observed that Mrs. S-- had Dixie tied with a rope, and was drawing her up to a small tree in the yard, for chastisement. Now, it so happened that there was a negro-trader in the neighborhood, who had taken a fancy to Dixie, and had offered the Colonel a thousand dollars for her, which he was disposed to take; but the sale had been prevented by her mistress. The Colonel seldom chastised his slaves with the rod; he was unrelenting in his feelings for disobedience, and proposed the sale of Dixie as a better punishment. Mrs. S-- gave her consent, but said that she would whip her first, if it was the last act of her life. And, accordingly, Dixie was chastised and sold.</p> 
               <p>I was much amused at the conversation of two common men of the neighborhood, who, for brevity, we will call Jeff and Abe. They held a low and interesting conversation upon the subject of Dixie's treatment, to which I paid particular attention, and shall never forget. It was as follows:</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Poor, down-trodden African! how long shall he groan beneath the tyranny of his master?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. The happiest people, as a race, upon the face of God's earth; at least, that portion of them who are in this country, enslaved.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. According to the constitution of man, there is no real happiness to be found outside of the invigorating name of Liberty.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Ah! liberty! What is liberty? Has a man the liberty to take his neighbor's goods? has a subject the liberty to insult the king? has a private man the liberty to assume official station? has a soldier the liberty to go to sleep on his post-a crime punished with death by military law? And is this not a similar case? Dixie slept on her post, and let destruction come to her charge. Her sentence is milder than that of a soldier.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Yes; but I speak of constitutional liberty: the liberty to pursue happiness; the liberty to obey the laws of one's country.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. That I understand to be the liberty of the white man; the liberty of the sane man; the liberty of the adult; not the liberty of the minor, the negro, the Indian, or the idiot.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Ah! Dixie's father was a white man. By what unknown law in metaphysics do you deprive the child of the inheritance of the father.'T is not on our statute-books.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. In the language of the English poet: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"From nature's chain, whatever link you strike,</l> 
                        <l>Tenth, or ten-thousandth, breaks the chain alike."</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q> A mule is the colt of a horse; yet a mule is not a horse.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. The ass is of a different species from the horse. There is but one species of the human<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6184-00000011"/> family, differing only in the color of the skin, as a white horse or a black horse.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. I know you think so; but there is a very wide difference, both in body and mind.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. The colored man has been borne down with slavery from generation to generation, and kept in ignorance, until servitude and abuse have made him inferior in mind; he is not inferior in body.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. So far as regards physical strength, the negro is not inferior to the white man; yet he is of a different temperament: he can endure more heat, but not so much cold; he is the native of a warm climate-naturally very indolent; yet he is capable of enduring much labor; but he will not labor of his own accord; he prefers ease of body to ease of mind; he takes no thought for the future, and, if he lived not with the white man, he would go back into barbarism.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. You do n't argue the question fairly; you strike a blow at half of creation with the word "negro;" your theory condemns a man to eternal servitude for one drop of blood.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. I condemn no man for the place of his birth. It may be unfortunate to be born in Rome. I know it is unfortunate to be born in the kitchen. The decrees of fate are beyond the control of man.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. My Bible teaches me that the human family are the descendants of Adam, having a common origin and a common destiny. Give me one Bible, one God, one religion, one people, and one liberty.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. I know you think so; but that has never been, and is not now, the history of man. He has now several Bibles, different gods, a variegated religion, five or six peoples, and no such thing as one liberty.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Ah! but is not our great mission upon earth to convert the heathen, to reform governments, to teach that all men are brothers, to "do unto others as you would have them do unto you?"</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. To "do unto others as you would have them (under similar circumstances) do unto you," is the best understanding of that passage of the Scripture. St. Paul, in the conversion of the wicked, meddled not with governments, or with master and servant. You would reform the fathers of the Church.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. We live in a progressive age; darkness and barbarism must give way before the light of freedom and religion; weights from all shoulders will be removed in this generation.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. We will see.</p>

               <p>THICK as the locusts of Egypt, thoughts crowded through the brain of those most deeply interested as to the whereabouts of Cora. The country had been diligently searched for five miles around, and many of the neighbors had given up in despair.</p> 
               <p>The sun was mounting the eastern horizon; the clouds grew thin and scattered far away; the breeze of the morning, cooled by the late rain, invigorated both horse and man. The Colonel had engaged some of the most expert woodsmen to make further search, who had set out upon their mission, taking a north-west course. In company with the Colonel, I soon followed, we having determined to penetrate the territory; for the Colonel was of opinion that some foul play had been enacted by some of the settlers of that virgin soil. And while we pursue-a few miles in the rear of our party-let us turn and listen to a conversation between Mrs. S-- and Aunt Patsie, a neighbor woman that had come to comfort the distressed mother as far as she could. Aunt Patsie was a very peculiar person. She could tell you the birthday, without a moment's reflection, of every child that had been born in the circle of her acquaintance for the last thirty years; she could tell the day of every battle of the Revolution; and, when a little excited upon religious topics, she could describe, in minute detail, the individual character of each of the twelve Apostles. It is said that Artemus Ward can hatch more curiosity than any man in America: but arouse Aunt Patsie's bump of inquisitiveness, and get her head set on curiosity, and she could hatch Artemus Ward. Mrs. S--, therefore, was hopeful that Aunt Patsie could, in some way, account for the disappearance of her lovely and innocent child.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Patsie, said: "The weather being warm, she could not have suffered with cold; the rain being hard, she might have fallen into some stream and drowned. The dark, rainy night must have frightened the poor little creature; but I never knew one of so tender age to die of fear. Indeed," continued Aunt Patsie, "a prairie-wolf might undertake to eat a child of that age; a hungry wolf is a desperate animal, and they sometimes go in gangs."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. S-- thought of the story of Romulus and Remus, who were, when infants, thrown into the river Tiber, in a basket, and afterward rescued and suckled by a wolf; and her imagination pictured the wolves fondling with her sweet little pet. "O, they<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6184-00000013"/> could not!" and the anxious mother wrung her hands.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Patsie raised her spectacles, and rubbed her hand over her forehead, as she said: "I tell you what it is, Jane: my Tom saw two Indians skulking along yesterday morning, and I will bet my salvation they have taken that child."</p> 
               <p>"O, my God! no-no!" and Mrs. S-- prayed secretly for relief from the prophetess.</p> 
               <p>I was conversing with the Colonel upon the dangers to which the sweet little Cora was subjected. We had just emerged from a deep ravine of timbered land, and entered the border of a broad and beautiful prairie, when the Colonel suddenly checked his horse. His countenance told me that some distant messenger had met his ear. No word was spoken; we paused a few moments in breathless silence: then came the sound of the woodsman's horn, in clear and distinct notes, o'er the broad-spread plain before us. "They have found her," said I to the Colonel, as we sped off in the direction of the welcome horn. We soon neared the party, and were doomed to disappointment; for we were only greeted with the bonnet and apron of little Cora, or what was supposed to be hers.</p> 
               <p>We were now across the State line and in Kansas Territory, near the domicile of a man who bore the Colonel a certain deadly hatred. And, notwithstanding one of the party had been informed by said man that he knew nothing of Cora or any other lost child, the Colonel said the child could not have been so near the premises without some knowledge of the family; and proposed putting said man to the torture until he should tell the truth. As I had some doubts of the identity of the bonnet, etc., and thinking that a little time would probably give us some due to this bonnet, I told the Colonel and party a short but true story upon circumstantial evidence. It is as follows:</p> 
               <p>On the border of a Western State lived an aged man, highly respected and wealthy, the father of an only daughter-who at that time was about seventeen years of age, and very beautiful-by the name of Minnie. There was a young man in the neighborhood by the name of Hardin, who had been raised by a mechanic in humble circumstances in life. Minnie and Hardin had been play and schoolmates from childhood. A certain thing that the old gentleman called <emph>pup-love</emph> had grown with their growth and strengthened with their strength. The old gentleman, not liking the course of events, for bade young Hardin the prerogative of his premises. Minnie was a dutiful child, and would not disobey her father; yet she met Hardin at a certain place by the road-side, where they had many long and interesting interviews. At last, one day, young Hardin, not liking to remain where circumstances so oppressed him, said to Minnie: "Your father objects to me because I am poor. I will seek fame and fortune in a distant land. When I have gained the requisite recommendations, I will come to your father's house and claim what I have the right and<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6184-00000014"/> honor to claim," And Minnie and her lover parted, with aching hearts and flooded eyes.</p> 
               <p>A steamer was advertised to depart from the coast the next morning.</p> 
               <p>Hardin went to the neighboring village and put up at an inn, where he had been much in the habit of stopping. Now, it so happened that the same night there came to the inn a certain mule-driver, and called for lodging. The inn being crowded, the landlord petitioned Hardin to admit the mule-driver to share his bed and room, to which Hardin consented. The two were soon after lighted by the landlord, up an outside flight of stairs, to Hardin's little room. While preparing to retire, the mule-driver took a fancy to Hardin's watch, for which he effected a trade by giving Hardin his watch and a few dollars in money; and, to use a Western phrase, they both "turned in." The mule-driver soon fell asleep. But this was not the case with Hardin: he thought of Minnie; he thought of his voyage; he thought of the day of his return; he thought of days gone by, and of the many long and tedious seasons that he had loved, so dearly loved, his Minnie. He could not sleep; nay, he could not lie still; and, bordering on distraction, he arose, intending to spend the remainder of the night on the road to the steamer, and thus left the mule-driver all alone.</p> 
               <p>Now, it so happened that a robber had been watching the mule-driver, for it was supposed that he had money. This robber, in ambush, saw the mule-driver lighted up to his room, and he saw the retreat of young Hardin, when he mentally exclaimed, "Ye gods! a glorious opportunity!" Then, silently and unseen, he approached the stairway and gently ascended. A light pressure upon the door, which had been left unfastened by Hardin, turned it slowly upon its hinges, and he entered the room; then paused to listen; no sound met his ear save the deep slumber of his victim; a whole eternity passed through his mind in a moment! An aged man lay before him, in the soft and sweet embrace of sleep; the night breeze, as it rustled through the silver locks upon his temples, told of the many years he had labored for his money; the pale moon glimmered through the lattice of the window, and showed the assassin where to strike. He grasped the handle of a polished blade with his right hand, and slowly drew it from its scabbard, as he gently raised his left hand to his brow to hide his countenance from the God of heave. Suddenly plunging forward, he struck the fatal blow; then, one death-struggle, one deep moan, and all was still, save the trickling of the dead man's blood.</p> 
               <p>The assassin hastily searched his coffers, and again sped away with cautious feet. As he neared the bottom of the stairway, the iron tongue of Time told the dark, dead hour of night, and the pulse of the town was still. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>The moon was sinking in the west,</l> 
                        <l>The night-hawk sought a place of rest;</l> 
                        <l>The clouds of night, with quick'ning speed,</l> 
                        <l>Hid a devilish villain's deed.</l> 
                     </lg>

               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6184-00000015"/> 
               <p>And he sped to the brushwood. Morning came; the dead man was found; the landlord told how and where he had left him. Suspicion fell upon young Hardin. Pursuit was made; the steamer had not yet sailed The watch of the mule-driver being found with young Hardin, the manner in which he left the town, was the circumstantial evidence against him, under which he was tried, condemned, and executed.</p> 
               <p>Minnie, knowing nothing of the innocence or guilt of her lover, died of a broken heart.</p> 
               <p>Five years after the above transactions, this same robber was taken, tried, and condemned to hang, for the murder of another man. He wrote in his confession that the mule-driver was the first man he ever murdered.</p> 
               <p>By this time we received satisfactory information that the bonnet and apron belonged to a little girl in the neighborhood, who had lost them on her return home from school.</p>

               <p>Colonel S-- had made extensive preparations to go to California in search of gold, a thing he had no need of under the sun, for he possessed a fine plantation and plenty of servants. That he was not satisfied can only be accounted for by the declaration of Jeremiah, the Hebrew prophet, that "man is strange, and wonderfully made." A few days before his appointed time to start, the accident of the loss of Cora had occurred, which interrupted all his arrangements, for the time being.</p> 
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6184-00000016"/> 
               <p>The last lingering ray of light faltered in the west; the broad mantle of night slowly and calmly covered the Western home of the Border Ruffian. A light tap with the knuckles upon the door-which, in the West, takes the place of the alarm-bell-announced the arrival of a stranger. A moment after, his old friend Mingo was admitted, who left him one year previously for the land of gold. The low, deep cunning that lingered in the corners of Mingo's mouth told the sadness of his tale. But we will let him tell it in his own fashion, with a vow that it was as true as the first chapter of Matthew:</p> 
               <p>"After we got out upon the plains, we thought all creation was going to California. The road was lined with a moving caravan as far as the eye could reach, before or behind; and all seemed to press forward with an indecent haste. After some days' travel, it was evident that many teams were failing; stock would weary and fall, and be left to die by the road-side. By the loss of teams, wagons also had to be left. Dead animals, deserted wagons, and new-made graves began to line the road. Nor was this all. Indiscreet men, as their teams began to fail, would throw out a portion of their provision to make the load lighter. Bacon, flour, cheese, crackers, we frequently met with on the road, but, what is very remarkable, we never found either whisky or tobacco.</p> 
               <p>"We were at last much frightened by the number of new-made graves. They were everywhere to be seen. Many a poor gold-hunter found his last resting-place upon that broad and desolate plain, separated from home and friends-and, in many cases, from a loving wife and little children-and laid with hasty hands into a new-made grave, with a blanket for a shroud, and the cold, damp earth for a coffin. It is strange how heedless one walks above the dead. On the night of the twenty-first day of our journey, I slumbered heavily, and was awakened about daylight by Picayune, who was very sick. This was the first misfortune we had met. We applied immediately to our medicines, but all to no effect; he grew worse and worse, until, at last, we closed his eyes upon the scenes of earth. I chiseled, as well as I could, the letters of his name upon a rough stone, and placed it at his head, and left him, with the prayer that the keeper of all the dead would guard his resting-place.</p> 
               <p>"Burtice separated from me in California. I afterward understood that he was unfortunately wounded by a Chinaman, and I suppose he is dead. When I got into the mines I found we had to wash so much dirt to get the gold, my soap soon gave out. I was not able to undergo the bodily fatigue. I could not dig like a ground-hog, and wash like a widow woman, with half a dozen starving brats gazing into the tub, watching the bubbles on the suds, expecting them to burst into loaves of bread. Being sick, Milo started home with me by water, but long before we arrived at the port of our destination, he, poor fellow, had to give up his last cares of the world, and was silently committed to the bosom of the deep. And<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6184-00000017"/> here am I, with less gold than I had when I started."</p> 
               <p>And Mingo, after receiving some presents from Colonel S--, went home to his family.</p> 
               <p>I said to the Colonel; "It is not all gold that glitters; a prize is magnified when it is far away; we eagerly seek it in the distance; the thorns and briers that lie in the pathway are overlooked; and we are apt to rush headlong to some distant object, when it would be better for us to take up, with cautious hands, those things that God and nature have placed in our way, and, with a cheerful heart, be contented with an honest living."</p>

               <p>THE golden leaves of the forest rustled on the ground; the low, still winds from the west drove the prairie-hens to the fields; the burning grass on the prairies announced the approach of autumn. Another long and dreary summer had passed away.</p> 
               <p>Since the loss of Cora, Mrs. S-- had been the constant inmate of her room, and her health, by this time, had so declined that the Colonel determined to call in a physician.</p> 
               <p>Dr. D-- lived at some distance; but, for his large experience and popular name, the Colonel was induced to send for him. I shall never forget the<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6184-00000018"/> bearing and demeanor of this extraordinary man. A man of few words, with grave and stern countenance, with iron firmness of purpose, he seemed to look through human nature as though he understood the secret spring of life.</p> 
               <p>I was anxious to hear the Doctor's opinion of Mrs. S--; for her case, to me, had appeared most singular. You can not imagine my surprise when, after an examination during which the Doctor asked a great many questions, he remarked to the Colonel, in slow and measured tones: "I do not believe I can help her without the aid of mesmerism." This was new to us, and unexpected. The Colonel made strong objections to his lady being made the subject of an experiment. The Doctor coolly remarked: "Then she must be made the subject of a graveyard."</p> 
               <p>After a long pause, the Doctor wisely remarked that it could do her no harm. After a long private conversation between the Doctor and the Colonel, they decided to try the experiment, much to the gratification of, at least, my curiosity.</p> 
               <p>As this part of the story must here take the appearance of a romance rather than the faithful record of historical facts, I must let Mrs. S-- tell her own story, as she related it to others, at the time:</p> 
               <p>"I had been suffering with a dumb headache for several days, without the least intermission. When Dr. D-- made the 'passes' before my face, it seemed to me, for a moment, that my head was bursting-every thing before me began to dance and disappear. I recollect nothing more. When I was aroused to consciousness, my head was free from pain, and I felt much relieved. When I was told by the Doctor and other persons present that, while in the mesmeric state, I had conversed upon various subjects quite rationally, and that I was very interesting in conversation, I was surprised; but when they told me that I had conversed with, and told them where Cora was, I did not believe the testimony of my own husband. I thought I was the victim of a joke.</p> 
               <p>"But when Dr. D-- made the 'passes' the second time, they seemed to throw down the wall that stood between my two selves. I spoke of my old self in the third person, and said: 'She is a cold and careless mother.' My new self saw and conversed with Cora. She told me that she was with very nice people. I told her that I did not want her to come home; that I had rather she would stay where she was, and learn how to work, and go to the church, and get religion. I told her that I would not stay here; that I was going away, and that very soon; and her father would not take her to church, for he was a cold man of the world.</p> 
               <p>"When Dr. D-- made the 'passes,' and I was again awakened, I had some faint idea of my two selves-an inkling of that inner consciousness, which seemed but a shadow of the mind. Yet the whole universe could not convince me that there does not dwell within ourselves another self, more spiritual, more lively, more conscious-a tenant of this<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6184-00000019"/> mortal clay far superior to our waking consciousness."</p> 
               <p>When Dr. D-- returned the next day, after what had transpired, Mrs. S-- was unwilling to undergo the operation again. The Colonel also objected, as, when she was in the mesmeric state, she would talk constantly of Cora, which called to her waking hours, and also to the mind of the Colonel, most sad and gloomy reflections.</p> 
               <p>Now, the strangest part of this whole story is, that Mrs. S--, for a few days, was very positive that mesmerism was no deception, and that she had realized, done, and said all that was said of her; but in one week she denied the whole affair, and said that she was imposed upon, and that she had no faith in mesmerism.</p>

                     <p>TIME! thou venerable sire, and mysterious harvest-hand! who gave you that old scythe, that never needs the whetting-stone, yet will not cut the thread of fate, or wound the gods? Is that thine only tool, thou builder of towns and cities, founder of governments and nations, and father of the arts and sciences? No mortal eye hath seen thy cradle; none shall see thy grave.</p>

               </epigraph> 
               <p>FIVE mortal years had lived and died since the loss of Cora, and no tidings of her had been received. The American States were prosperous and happy; emigrants were flocking to the West by thousands; Kansas was preparing to make her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">dbut</foreign> into the sisterhood of States. Missouri, jealous of the aspirations of her young sister, voluntarily assumed the task of arranging her wardrobe. But the maiden Queen of the West was disposed to listen to flatterers! Missouri would, indeed, clothe her in a white robe; but her flatterers would trim it with a black ribbon.</p> 
               <p>It was given out that emigrants from the North were flocking to Kansas to make her a free State under the Douglas policy, who had no thought of making Kansas their home. This opportunity was<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6184-00000020"/> also eagerly embraced by Missourians. A law had been enacted in Kansas allowing all tax-payers to vote. The poll-tax being only one dollar upon each head, any one could vote that could pay that tax.</p> 
               <p>Parties from Missouri were fitted out for no other purpose than to go to Kansas, vote for some pro-slavery man, and return. It was on one of these occasions, when a party was preparing to start to Kansas for that purpose, with the Colonel at their head, that my attention was again called to another conversation between Jeff and Abe. It ran as follows:</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. I think it is very unfair for those Missourians to go to Kansas for no other purpose than to try to make her a slave State.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. I have heard an old saying that "it is as fair for the goose as the gander." The Free-State people are doing the same thing.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. But slavery ought not to be extended.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. That is only a difference in opinion. Free-State men think one way, and Slave-State men think the other.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. But the Free-State men are right; they act upon the principles of justice and equal rights.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. I know that you think so; but why take the territory from the Indians and give it to the negroes?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. To make it a free State is not giving it to the negroes.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Your doctrine will lead to that. Confine the western emigration of slavery to the borders of Missouri, make all the territory west free, and in twenty years your new States will be governed by the negroes.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. That is bare assertion. Where is the free State that is governed by the "negroes," as you call them?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. The negroes at present are in better business; but open the virgin soil west with freedom to the negro, and he will leave his master in Missouri, and seek a shelter among you; politicians will favor him, and, under the majority form of elections, he will command the balance of power. That is what I mean by "governing."</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Yes; but if we do not extend to him the right of suffrage?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Then you repudiate your doctrine, and had better let him remain in slavery.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. We can take him out of slavery, and not extend to him citizenship.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. There is no middle ground; no half-way house. You would enslave him to the nation, instead of individuals. What is the difference?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. In what manner would that enslave him to the nation?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Deprive a man of citizenship, give him no voice in the laws that are to govern him, and what is he but a slave?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. He is still at liberty to work for whom he pleases, and regulate, in part, his own wages.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. What is a sterner master than necessity? The slave that defrauds necessity, defrauds himself, and not his master.</p> 
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6184-00000021"/> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Then you would make all poor men slaves.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. They are, in the sense you mention; but, while they are the slaves of necessity, they are freemen, because they are citizens, and have a voice in the laws of their country, and the way is open to them to rise above necessity. If they have the personal merit, they may rise to the first gift that is in the people of the nation. The man who is not a citizen can not rise, because that barrier is impassable; it hangs before the eyes of energy like a dark cloud of misery, through which no fugitive can pierce.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Honesty compels me to acknowledge that the prejudice against the black man, on account of color, will have to give way; and it will, in time: he must and will become a citizen.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Then you make no difference between antislavery men; their disputes are but a question of time!</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. E-x-a-c-t-l-y! There is, however, another view of the subject: some anti-slavery men are for sending them out of the country, or forming a government for them somewhere on the continent.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. To send them out of the country! There is not one in fifty that would be willing to go; besides, if sent to themselves, they would come to no good; and, if governed by a portion of the whites, they would be little better still than slaves. As to settling them on the continent-to make a nation within a nation-first, it would be gross injustice to deprive any portion of the white race of their territory for that or any other purpose; secondly, the black nation would be but the slave of the white. What you condemn in individuals, you would inaugurate in nations. What is the difference?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. You talk very fairly. But slavery can not be justified; it is wrong in nature; man is not a beast. God gave man dominion over all the beasts of the fields; the fishes in the sea; the fowls in the air; but to man over man he gave no dominion.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. You would make heaven on earth. I fear it is a dangerous experiment. As to your quotation from the Bible, I will satisfy you with the Bible before we get through.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. No, I would not do so; but I would have man to follow the course marked out for him by the God of the Universe.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Your doctrine would bring all people under one government. Would you separate Church and State?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. We will speak of that at another time; for the present, I am more concerned for the Missourians. They will get into trouble in Kansas. I had rather see this business settled peaceably.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. I have much to say upon the subject yet, and hope that you will seriously reflect upon it.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
               <p>ON a hot and dusty day in August, Colonel S-- called at a certain house in Kansas for a drink of water. A pitcher of water was handed him by a girl some ten years of age.</p> 
               <p>Kind reader! behold a thirsty man, with a pitcher of cold water in one hand, the other resting upon a rail of the fence, gazing, with that intensity of look with which the serpent charms the bird, upon a meek, half-grown woman, and you see Colonel S-- looking at Cora. Five years had fled since he beheld that beautiful child, and, as unexpected as an angel from heaven, she stood before him, in all the simplicity of her beauty. Could he be mistaken? The outlines of those ruby lips, upon which he had impressed thousands of kisses, were there; the long, black lashes that shaded those crystal blue eyes, which had so often looked upon him with childish love, were there; the same golden ringlets, that time had lengthened and care improved, clustered round the face of the beautiful maiden. Colonel S-- trembled. Cora, unconscious of the earnest gaze of her father, modestly traced the hem of her apron with one hand, while with the other she plucked the blushing blossoms from a rose-bush that stood by the yard-fence. She started with surprise when the Colonel asked her name.</p> 
               <p>"My name is Cora, but they call me Betty," she modestly replied.</p> 
               <p>When prudence masters passion, when all the elements of our nature submit to will, it is then the great monitor of the mind is revealed: it is then we are reminded of the doctrine of the great Teacher, "What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"</p> 
               <p>Colonel S-- knew the danger of making him self known at the time, even to his own child. How she had been taken there-the disposition of those people toward her-what idea she had of her parents and home-were all questions to be approached with great caution and delicacy. But, fully satisfied that this lovely maiden was his Cora, he could not refrain from asking a few more questions, and the following conversation ensued:</p> 
               <p>"Does your father live here?"</p> 
               <p>"No, sir; my father is dead, and my mother, too."</p> 
               <p>"Where did they formerly live?"</p> 
               <p>"In Missouri; a long way from here."</p> 
               <p>"How long have you lived here?"</p> 
               <p>"Ever since my father and mother were killed."</p> 
               <p>"Who killed your father and mother?"</p> 
               <p>"Snake-sheed and Dart-feather."</p> 
               <p>"And who brought you here?"</p> 
               <p>"Snake-sheed and Dart-feather."</p> 
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6184-00000023"/> 
               <p>"Where did they get you?"</p> 
               <p>"They killed Dixie, and went home and killed father and mother, and were going to kill me, and then they brought me here."</p> 
               <p>Cora's bosom was heaving, and her eyes were full. The Colonel saw that it would not do to prolong the conversation, and he only added: "Do they treat you well at this home?" and Cora replied, "Not very."</p> 
               <p>The Colonel turned to join his party with a joyful, but, at the same time, a heavy heart. The election was the next day, and they had thirty miles to travel.</p> 
               <p>The Colonel's party had murmured, one to another, like the apostles of Jesus: "Why talks he with the woman?" The Colonel had said, in his heart: "I have a well of water, springing up into eternal life." But he kept his own counsel.</p> 
               <p>And off the party dashed away for the precinct.</p> 
               <p>Cora returned to her silent work, brooding over the mysterious conduct of the stranger. She had grown old enough to realize the fact that people do not always tell the truth; and it perhaps entered her mind, for the first time, that her parents still lived. For long and weary hours she pondered over the actions of Snake-sheed and Dart-feather; she called to mind all she had ever heard of the Indian character; and she half knew her father; but why he had so unceremoniously left, she could not divine: but her mind was opened to a new train of reflections.</p> 
               <p>Colonel S-- and party had accomplished their mission in Kansas, which was to vote at a certain election. On the return home, many of the party could not be detained. The Colonel, taking into his confidence Burtice, of California notoriety, and a few other friends, determined to remain a few days in the neighborhood of Cora's Kansas home, and take her back to Missouri; for law was a thing talked of at this time in Kansas, but seldom put in force, excepting the law of power. Certain citizens of that virgin soil bore a deadly hatred to all Missourians; and it was evident that Cora was dwelling with one of that class. Burtice was selected by the party as the most suitable person to go to the place of Cora's residence, in disguise, and ascertain how matters stood.</p> 
               <p>It was evening, and the sun was down, as Burtice approached a hewed-log house that stood in a skirt of timber not far from the waters of Owl Creek. When met at the door, by a tall and bony man, he made application to remain with him over night; being refused, he insisted, complaining of being very tired. His external appearance was that of a New Englander, and the Major took Burtice for one of his own countrymen; so he finally consented to keep him all night.</p> 
               <p>"I guess this is a fine country for keows," said Burtice, as the Major welcomed him to a seat. Burtice played off upon the Major entirely to his satisfaction, with the exception of one thing-he could get no interview with Cora. So he returned to the Colonel with the following information:</p> 
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6184-00000024"/> 
               <p>That two Indians had brought the child there some five years previous, and openly acknowledged that they had stolen her from Missouri; that the Major had coaxed the child away from them; that he sent her to school, and was much attached to her, and said he would not give her up, even to her own father, were he to come; and that the Major believed the story of the Indians, as above related by Cora, or pretended to believe it; that Cora was attached to some of the Major's family, was evident to Burtice.</p> 
               <p>"A private interview must be had with Cora," said the Colonel, firmly.</p> 
               <p>Burtice said he had not been upon a fool's errand; that he had left his watch in the room where he slept, designedly; that he would return some time the same day for its recovery, at which time he hoped that a more favorable opportunity would present itself for an interview with Cora.</p> 
               <p>The watch was returned to Burtice by the hand of Cora: he whispered in her ear, "Dixie," and the name of her mother, and that he desired a private interview with her. He obtained it before he left the premises, by an artful arrangement of Cora.</p> 
               <p>Burtice left, assuring Cora that he would be at the end of a certain lane that night, at a certain hour, to meet her. Cora returned to her occupation and to her reflections. O God! could this be a dream, or was it reality? How strange it all seemed! Busy thoughts crowded each other out of Cora's brain, until night arrived, and with night the crisis.</p> 
                
               <p>It was dark, and Cora trembled. Silently and unseen, she prayed to God to direct her. When she raised up from her prayer, she said, mentally, "My mother taught me how to pray so, long ago. I will see her, if she is alive, though it cost me my life." And she sped to the end of the lane.</p> 
               <p>"God bless you!" said Burtice, as he threw her on his horse, and galloped to the Colonel's party.</p>

               <p>TWO years prior to the visit of our voting party to Kansas, Burtice had returned from California. He had made some money, and was now settled on a farm in Missouri, the father of a small family, the owner of a few slaves, and much interested in making Kansas a slave State; said he would make a hundred trips to Kansas, and vote every time, if, by so doing, that would give a start to the pro-slavery men of Kansas. He said: "Get the institution once planted, and the Northerners would not emigrate to the territory, as they abhorred a slave State like the devil does holy water. They are raised to believe that there is something in slavery repugnant to republicanism; they think a slaveholder is an aristocrat, in favor of an aristocracy, with no sympathy for the laboring class. Poor victims of mistake! If you can get one of them to live in a slave State, you will change him as certain as a tadpole turns to a frog. I once knew a young man by the name of Fox, who wedded a lady in a slave State, himself having been born and bred in a free State. By the union he became the owner of a few slaves. He at first said that he didn't like the '<emph>Union as it was;</emph>' that he preferred a union of his own, and proposed to set the slaves free. But as this created some strife in the household, he consented to try the '<emph>Union as it was.</emph>' It was the custom in that neighborhood to hire out negroes on the first day of January. In all slave communities some of the slaves have to be hired out, their owners not being in a situation to want their labor. 'Please God, massa, I no want to live dis year wid Mister Fox,' was the universal cry of the negroes that had to be hired out. Besides, we have Illinois on the east, Iowa on the north, and to have Kansas on the west, Missouri will be like a dry stick poked into a hot furnace."</p> 
               <p>By such reflections, the pro-slavery men of Missouri resorted to extraordinary means to defeat the Free-State men of Kansas.</p>

Observe the careworn countenance; the restless and wakeful slumber; the watchful and diligent eye; the nice and close calculations to make the production of the labor of his family meet their necessities.

She had been a slave in early life-in fact, nearly all her life; had been taken to California by her owners, and, through the vicissitudes of the early struggles there, had been left all alone. She made her living by washing for the emigrants or gold-hunters. In this hour of darkness and desolation she was my only surgeon and nurse. I shall never forget the kind attentions of that old creature. She told me that for forty years, on her old master's plantation, she had done nothing but nurse the sick; and, perhaps, to that experience alone I am indebted for my life. She said that the raw Africans, several of whom had been brought upon her master's plantation, were universally held in contempt by the negroes as being altogether inferior to the negroes of this country. In fact, the many stories that she told me of their inclination to barbarism, which are not fit to appear in these pages, convinced me that the portion of the African race now in this country are infinitely better off than their original ancestors, or that portion of the race now in their native land.</p> 
               <p>"Yet I am not an advocate of the slave-trade; not because I think it would be a hardship upon the African, or that it is morally wrong, but that it is an injury and a curse to the white people of this country; a bone of contention between individuals and between States; the apple of discord and the Pandora-box of the State-house; the canker-worm that is gnawing the roots of the tree of Liberty; the raven that is plucking the feathers from the American eagle; the rings of Saturn that eclipse the brilliancy of the Star-spangled Banner; and the fate that is wrenching the scepter from the grasp of the Goddess of Liberty.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
               <p>MAJOR SIX was the common appellation applied to Cora's Kansas father. It is said he received it by the following circumstances: When a boy at school he was very contentious with his playmates upon all subjects of dispute, and always strenuously contended for the decision of the majority, placing an undue accent on the first two syllables of the word <emph>majority;</emph> from that circumstance he received the name, among the boys, of the Major. And when quite a young man he had an unfortunate quarrel with a celebrated boxer, who knocked him down six times; and he raised and rushed at his antagonist every time, until they were separated by some friends; and from that day he was called Major Six.</p> 
               <p>Individuals and societies seldom choose the names they wear; and characters often change the names of men.</p> 
               <p>The flight of Cora did not fully develop itself to him until the next morning. His knowledge of the West and Western men taught him that pursuit was useless; and he gave vent to his fit of anger by swearing destruction to all Missourians. He said that he would take from Missouri a thousand negroes to pay for the loss of Cora.</p> 
               <p>And from that day Major Six commenced seeking followers to persecute Missourians; and thus we leave the Major organizing one of the most formidable bands that ever shed the blood of a pro-slavery man in Kansas.</p> 
               <p>While we glance at the residence of Colonel S--, we find Cora once more happy in her native home, though changes around that home hung over her childish memory like a dark and dismal cloud. Her mother-that loving mother, the memory of whom nerved her trembling limbs in her late flight from her prison-house in Kansas-had long since been laid in that narrow house that tenants all the dead; and her only solace for that mother was to visit, silently and unseen, the place where they had laid her. Like Mary of old, on the morning of the first day of the week, before it is yet light, she goeth to the sepulcher, and there communes with the God of all the living. And with her own little hands she pressed the crumbling dirt to the roots of a rose-bush in that soil resting so lightly upon the breast of her earthly parent; there she dropped faithful tears, to sink down to the bony fingers of the hand that rested upon her infant brain when her mother last called down Heaven's blessings upon her child. Then again her childish heart was gleeful and merry. How sweet to visit the places of her early and infant sports! The orchard, the pasture,<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6184-00000029"/> the garden, the rivulet, and the pond, were sources of unbounded delight. But Dixie-ah! poor Dixie-was gone, the nurse and companion of her childhood.</p> 
               <p>In those sad hours of the past Cora's mind wandered back to her Kansas home, and her memories of that prison-house were sad, with one exception: there was a ray of light in the dark memories of her Kansas trip. It was her thoughts of Don Partlo, a member of the Major's family, two years her senior. She thought of their strolls in the woods in search of flowers; of the kind and willing hand with which he would help her do her task; of his flowing curls and manly face; of his generous temper and bold daring, for she had never known him to falter when courage and resolution were demanded. And she wondered if fate and fortune, during her pilgrimage in this wide world, would ever permit her once more to see the sweet and lovely face of Don Partlo.</p> 
               <p>Cora, at this time, stood on the middle-ground between child and womanhood; in that half-way house where the robe of childhood is consecrated to the memory of the past, and the costume of woman covers the young and ardent heart, beating high with hope; and she loved the youth of Kansas.</p> 
               <p>Don Partlo was a boy that Major Six had picked up. As the Major had no children of his own, he was endeavoring to perform the office of father to some one. It was said by some that the father of Don Partlo was a Western trapper, and that he was born among the Indians; it was also said that his nativity was in the East, and that he was brought West by some of the emigrants, from whom he escaped. Be this as it may, it is certain that none but Anglo-Saxon blood coursed through his veins. His attachment to Cora was early formed, and he had rendered her Kansas home a paradise to what it would have been without him; and he said in his heart, "When I am a man I will see her again." And he did see her under the most trying circumstances.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head> 
               <p>ON the margin of a broad and beautiful prairie, surrounded by a grove of young timber, stood the house of Burtice. When I sought relief from solitude, and desired the comfort of invigorating society, I usually visited the house of this man; for it was the resort of numerous friends, who were ever joyous and happy.</p> 
               <p>I was surprised one evening, when entering the front room, to find it vacated, save a venerable lady, sitting upon one corner of the hearthstone, busily plying her fingers with some needlework. Upon the other corner lay stretched at full length a huge mastiff. Midway between the two sat an old house-cat, eyeing the mastiff and mistress, and ready to retreat from the first invader.</p> 
               <p>I passed through; in the back yard was assembled a large party of men. I soon ascertained that another voting trip to Kansas was in vogue. Having no disposition to engage in the council, I sought the company of two men who were seated closer to the house, when my attention was again called to another conversation between Jeff and Abe. It is as follows:</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. You have not answered my question of Church and State.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Moses, the Hebrew law-giver and man of God, united Church and State; and yet no one can shut their eyes to the fact that numerous bloody wars have grown out of that union. Our fathers, when framing this government, thought it best to separate them. I would not lay a Vandal hand upon the Constitution.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Then there must be two revolutions. After the negro is made a free man, and the right of citizenship conferred upon him, what will be his position in the Church? How would you like for one of your daughters to take a seat in church by the side of a big buck nigger?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. A change of fashions sometimes strikes the eye very harshly: that is a matter of taste and fashion. How would you like for your daughter to take a seat in church by the side of a big greasy white man? I know that you would not like to associate your children with the mean and low; but the white man who is not decent is inexcusable-the negro has now the excuse of being a slave; and as to the fashions of the day, I never expect to see them expelled from the church, or elsewhere. We must not confound the spirit with the body: though one may be low in this life, he may be high in the life to come.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. You do not exactly understand me. Will<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6184-00000031"/> it not take a revolution to admit the negro to all the privileges of the Church?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. I can not see that it would.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Before we get through, I will give you some very strong proofs that the negro is not the equal of the fathers of the Church, spiritually considered.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. I would like to see the evidence, and will patiently await your convenience, and let you show me, at this time, what right one man has to property in another-to own him like a beast.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. You look at one side of the question only: the master has no more property in the slave than the slave has in the master-the master being entitled to the labor of the slave, and the slave to the care of the master. These are absolute titles, one as much so as the other. The slave is bound to the master for his labor, if he is able to perform it; the master is bound to the slave for his care, whether he receives the labor or not. If the slave fall sick, or is crippled for life, no portion of the master's care is removed; it is the absolute property of the slave; he demands it; the laws of his country give it to him; and, in some cases, it is demonstrated that the slave has a more valuable property in his master than his master has in him. Your comparison of the slave to a beast is incorrect. If the master's horse fall lame, and is a cripple for life, he shoots him to save his fodder. Not so with the slave: he is bound to protect him; that protection is the slave's property, and he dare not touch it. Even after the slave is dead, the law protects his last right of property in his master, to lay him decently in the grave.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Well, that is something, I confess, upon which I never strictly thought before. But this much I say: if the property of the master is no more absolute than the property of the slave, it is, at least, a little more respectable.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Of course; the white man, being the superior race, is entitled to the superior position. Besides, to reverse the position would be like turning a cart upside down: the bed would not carry the wheels with the same facility that the wheels carry the bed.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. That is a beautiful illustration, but, according to your doctrine, all superior races should hold dominion over all inferior ones; superior minds over inferior ones. What has become of your democracy?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. I have not said that all superior races should domineer over all inferior ones, nor that superior minds should domineer over inferior ones; far from it. That the minds of some men are superior to others, even of the same race, no one will deny; but that such should domineer over others is far from the truth. All wise men should make the best use of the talents God has given them, for the benefit and comfort of the whole race. A truly wise man is meek and lowly of heart.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Yet you affirm that the white race should hold dominion over the black in this country. Have you any other excuse than that the whites are the superior race? If there is any other excuse for<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6184-00000032"/> slavery, I would like to hear it. You sweep the whole black race with the club of inferiority, put the whites over them, and then assert, in the next breath, that the superior should not domineer over the inferior. This is strange logic. Where is the right of the white man over the black? I would like to see it in a more distinct light. If I am in error, may God direct me to the right!</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. I will offer no better right, at present, than that of a long-established custom, and the apparent necessity that the races should live together, which would be impossible only with their present relations, the slaveholders themselves not being accountable for those relations. About two hundred and forty years ago "a Dutch vessel arrived at Jamestown, Virginia, with twenty Africans, and offered them for sale as slaves. They were purchased by the people. These were the first slaves brought into the country: and thus was laid the foundation of that system of slavery which now exists in the United States. The majority of the people of Virginia were for a long time opposed to slavery, and laws were passed to prevent it; but the selfish policy of the kings and proprietors in England encouraged the introduction of slaves, and the evil could not be resisted by the colonist." Thus a wrong-if it be a wrong-was forced upon our ancestors. An attempt now to rectify it would do more harm than good.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. In quoting the history of Virginia, why not quote that other passage, which says: "The colony hitherto consisted almost entirely of men who came for the purpose of acquiring wealth, and who intended again to return to England. But, in order to attach them more to the soil, and to induce them to regard this as their home, in 1620 the Company seat over ninety girls to be disposed of among the young planters for wives. At first the price of a wife was one hundred pounds of tobacco; but the demand for them increased so much that it soon rose to one hundred and sixty pounds." And this is the same year that they sold them the negroes. Who would now think of offering tobacco for a wife? That part of the barbarism has passed away: why do you wish to retain the other?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Had the system of slavery passed away as easily and as early as the sale of wives, we would not now be discussing it. The one hundred pounds of tobacco was probably required to pay the passage of a girl. The sale of a wife is contrary to all civilization: the sale of a slave is a different sort of contract.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. He that would purchase a slave is, in my opinion, at best, but partly civilized. The purchase and sale of wives and slaves are the relics of barbarism. One has been abandoned by all civilized countries; the other will be.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Time and circumstances change things; for, while the price of slaves has very much advanced, instead of selling our daughters, we have to provide a pretty good fortune to get them off our hands. But I see the men are coming in. We will speak further upon this subject at another time.</p>

               <p>IN the city of P-- there flourished a female academy, under the immediate care of Mr. --. Colonel S-- made the necessary arrangements for placing Cora with a family in that city, to attend what he termed boarding-school. Previously, Cora had only attended, for a short time, a small country school of little children; boys and girls all mixing, without distinction of sex. When Cora received the information that she was to attend the academy, she lost no time in making every necessary preparation. She remembered the innocent plays of her childhood with the little girls of Kansas; and she thought that to be associated with so many large girls of her own age would be very nice. That she would be behind them in letters, she much feared; but she hoped to make up for that deficiency with kind and lady-like behavior.</p> 
               <p>Thus her mind was occupied while she made all haste to regulate her wardrobe. The morning of her departure at last came. She turned back, with one long, lingering look, as the shades of her father's house disappeard from her view; she thought of the shade-trees, and all their endearments; and, in taking leave of the scenes of her childhood, her mind wandered to the grave of her mother. She buried her face in her hands.</p> 
               <p>The coach-driver gently drew the reins of his horses, as though he would have them tread lightly upon the road, as he said, secretly, "Cora is praying."</p> 
               <p>The morning of the first day of the school Cora made many new acquaintances, and passed through the ordeal of her lessons with great satisfaction to herself. She saw that application would soon put her at the head of her class, and she was highly animated.</p> 
               <p>The girls were all very clever. Evening came, and the labors of the day were over. Cora was gratified with an invitation to spend the early part of the night at the room of little "Sis"-a fancy name in vogue for one of the most brilliant girls in the school-where, it was said, several of the young ladies would meet and have a nice time. Cora attended with a joyful heart, and entered freely into the plays and conversation. But she was soon thrown on the reserve. The girls romped and talked until Cora hung her head in very shame. Cora had <unclear>passed</unclear> the usual age at which youth and innocence shake hands and bid each other an eternal farewell;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6184-00000034"/> but seclusion, the lack of association, and her own modest temper, had kept her in the innocent path of childhood. The girls with whom she was now associated had reached that point in female education which teaches that it is no harm for one woman to talk to another.</p> 
               <p>When Cora was alone in her own apartment, she mentally said, as the language of the girls still echoed through her mind, "Those girls have <emph>live mothers.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>That night Cora formed a determination to attend strictly to her studies, and leave the girls to romp without her company. Little Sis profited by her example, and, at the close of the session, those two young ladies were robed with the highest honors of the school.</p>

               <p>NEAR the waters of Owl Creek, in the territory of Kansas, lived Hawkeye. He had for many years been a trapper on the Upper Missouri; and, from a bloody skirmish he once had with an Indian of that name, he received the appellation, by which he was ever afterward called. Of late he concluded to try the pleasures of domestic life. His wife was the niece of Burtice. Being naturally fond of seclusion and wild scenery, he settled upon the wide-spread fields of Owl Creek, and commenced the cultivation of the soil. He was the father of two little girls, Rosa and Dolla; and lived in a neat cabin of his own erection, and was providing almost entirely for the wants of his family upon his own premises. Besides a small herd of cattle and swine, he had two horses, Big-bobtail Sorrel and Little bobtail Sorrel, of which the whole family were very<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6184-00000035"/> fond. They were tied up every night close to the cabin, for as yet he had no stable.</p> 
               <p>Rosa, being the eldest, would carry the corn for Big-bobtail, and Dolla would carry it for Little-bobtail. The two children and mother claimed Little bobtail, for he was gentle and kind-they all could ride him without fear. Big-bobtail would snort and paw; and little Dolla said he was a bad horse, and that papa might have him. Hawkeye always rode the Big-bobtail; and the little girls, when they would be anxiously looking for the return of their father, would closely watch the pranks and maneuvering of Little-bobtail. He would neigh, paw, and stick his ears forward whenever his keen, animal sagacity or instinct detected, in the distance, the sound of the hoof of his returning companion.</p> 
               <p>Late one evening in the twilight, little Dolla came running in, clapping her tiny hands, saying, "Mamma, papa is coming, for Little-bobtail is pawing and pointing his ears up the road;" and she ran and called Rosa to get the corn. In a few moments Hawkeye was securing his horses and kissing his children. That night, when Hawkeye took his seat at the board of his little family, his faithful wife discovered that the brave brow of her husband was slightly darkened, and, with an imploring look, said, "What is the matter?" Hawkeye replied, "This infernal negro question will ruin us yet." The mother of his two little babes was silent; the dread of some calamity had taken possession of her soul, and she could not reply, but said, mentally: "We have no negroes-may never have any; why meddle with the subject? I wish my husband was a wooden man, upon whom the designs of the Pro-slavery and Anti-slavery parties could take no effect; then we might live in security, for I feel that nothing else could disturb us."</p> 
               <p>Hawkeye was a violent pro-slavery man, and one that the Anti-slavery party much feared; for all agreed that, when excited, he was a desperate man. They said, "Make the old trapper<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="WRIGHT2-0653-NOTE001" n="*"
                        place="foot">
                     <p >Hawkeye, though an old trapper, was a man of middle age.</p>
                  </note> mad, and he would shoot a man as quick as he would a wolf."</p> 
               <p>The cock had announced the middle of the night; Rosa and Dolla were nestled in each other's arms; Hawkeye breathed heavily, as though he was disturbed in his sleep. The vigilant ear of Mary, his loving wife, detected some uncommon sound. She crept to the window, and saw horses standing around the house, and men busily engaged harnessing Big and Little-bobtail Sorrels. She hesitated; then said, "O my God! robbers are upon us!" Hawkeye bounced up and seized his gun, and Mary clasped the little children in her arms. At this moment the door was opened; Hawkeye saw he was overpowered, and threw down his gun.</p> 
               <p>One of the men said, addressing himself to Hawkeye, "You are my prisoner."</p> 
               <p>Hawkeye demanded, "By what authority?"</p> 
               <p>"By the authority of Major Six, sir," responded the would-be officer.</p> 
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6184-00000036"/> 
               <p>Hawkeye was disarmed. The premises having been searched for ammunition, the party started off, taking Hawkeye and his two horses.</p> 
               <p>Little Dolla pulled the skirt of her mother's dress, saying, "Mamma, where are they taking papa?"</p> 
               <p>"Hush!" whispered Rosa; "mamma is praying."</p> 
               <p>The sun rose next morning upon the pale face of Hawkeye; the blood that had coursed through his veins with such wanton vigor was now sinking in the soil of a wide and desolate prairie.</p> 
               <p>We have seen the gathering of men at the house of Burtice. About this time that expedition arrived in the neighborhood of Owl Creek. They had been to the polls and voted, and hearing of the fate of Hawkeye, determined to have revenge.</p> 
               <p>Burtice provided a party to conduct his niece and her little ones to Missouri, after getting all the information they possessed concerning the party that took Hawkeye, which, of course, was very meager, as the men were only seen in the night, and a dark night, too. But they had taken the horses-a minute description of which was obtained.</p> 
               <p>The party in charge of Mary started for Missouri. Burtice, with fifteen select men, remained on the scout in the territory.</p> 
               <p>Burtice returned the next week to Missouri with Hawkeye's Big-bobtail Sorrel horse. Some citizens of Kansas found two men, near the margin of Owl Creek, hanging silently, between heaven and earth, to the limb of a tree. The ravens had picked out their eyes.</p>

               <p>"IF it feeds nothing else, it will feed my revenge. Has not an anti-slavery man a heart, sympathies, hopes, human desires, and moral obligations, as other men have? Has he not a right to wish for, to hope for, to pray for, the greatest bonds of freedom? Has he not a right to feel for, to love, and to cherish, the human race? Is his heart made of stone, and his ears of brass, that the wailing sound of his fellow-man should be shut out from his soul?</p> 
               <p>"No! he has a mind, a heart, and an arm to raise on the side of the oppressed, and against the oppressors and those who favor them. The pro-slavery men of our own territory hinder us of half our strength. They feed the Missourians, eavesdrop our conversations, set out baits to catch our men, and, if they hang them not, they favor it.</p> 
               <p>"We will give some of them a few lessons, and the balance will flee the territory, and anti-slavery men will not be found hanging to trees for the ravens to pick. If it feeds nothing else, it will feed my revenge."</p> 
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6184-00000037"/> 
               <p>Thus whispered Major Six, in his secret thoughts, late one afternoon, as he approached the house of a friend, with whom he wished to counsel concerning the character of some men who lived at Timber Point. On the southern bank of a deep and muddy ravine, a few acres of timber had been cleared away, in the edge of which, and near the creek, stood an old log house. It had been built many years since by the Indians, but was now the residence of a neighbor and close friend of Major Six, by the name of Dutch Bob.</p> 
               <p>The sun silently sunk in the west, leaving the last traces of his glory mantling, with the shades of twilight, Major Six and his friend, as they held the following conversation:</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Major Six. I believe, if Ned should get any in formation of our intentions, he would let the cat out of the bag. He sees those men, you know, every day, at Timber Point; says that he was born and raised in Kentucky; is very loud-mouthed for our party; but, may he not be a wolf in sheep's clothing? I tell you he must not be trusted; at least, not without some further investigation.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Bob. Well, as to his having been born and bred in a slave State, it is a well-known fact, when a citizen of a slave State takes a turn against slavery, they are the worst in all the deck. And, also, when a man born and bred in a free State takes up with pro-slavery men and their "institution," as they call it, they are worse, and a great deal worse, than a man born and bred among slavery.</p> 
                
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Major Six. I know all of that. But Ned lives close to those men, and I suspect him because they have not beaten him off. I tell you, Bob, "Birds of a feather will flock together."</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Bob. Ned has a very fine place; it is one of the most desirable in the territory. That, I think, is the reason he does not leave the neighborhood.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Major Six. I fear him. He must be taken by some stratagem and carried away from home, or he must share the fate of those with whom he lives.</p> 
               <p>The Major rose to take his leave. "I will arrange that," whispered Bob, and he squeezed his hand.</p> 
               <p>As the western hemisphere blindfolded the eye of day, the shades of night fell between the two.</p>

               <p>"THE times are getting p-r-e-c-a-r-i-o-u-s! It is no use to argue this subject any longer. The pro-slavery men are unrelenting and vicious; they have no respect for a man's sympathies, or his kindness of heart. What they lack in argument they try to carry by force. A man had as well be convicted of horse-stealing as accused of abolitionism, in their community. With them it is the unpardonable sin; one for which there is no redemption in this world, or the world to come. You may take their horses, burn their houses, kill their sons, and they say you are a robber and a murderer; but, if you touch their negroes, they say you are an <emph>Abolitionist,</emph> which is equivalent to saying you are an imp of the Devil, let loose from the bottomless pit to terrify and enslave mankind. But get into an argument with them on the peculiar institution, and they will say something about lowering the white man, raising the black, and striking a level between the two on the yellow; or some other such nonsense."</p> 
                
               <p>Thus Abe was speculating, in his own mind, as the slender form of his neighbor darkened his door.</p> 
               <p>"Good morning, friend Jeff! I suppose you have heard the news," said Abe, as he politely offered his neighbor a seat.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Yes, I have heard the news, and sorry I was to hear it. The boys have got at it, at last, and I fear the consequences.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. And so do I But you and I will not engage in the fight; let us take the storm coolly. <emph>Is any body hurt?</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Yes; Hawkeye is killed-murdered in cold blood-and his widow is with us. What Burtice has done I know not, but I know the man.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Where will all this end? "A house divided against itself can not stand. I believe this Union can not endure, permanently, half free and half slave. I do not expect the Union will be dissolved; I do not expect the house to fall; but, I do expect it to cease to be divided. It will all become one thing, or all the other."</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Before that takes place the hills will echo with the sound of cannon, the valleys will be desolated, and the rivers run with blood.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. "I have said a hundred times-and have no desire to take it back-that I believe the Free-State men have no right to go into the slave States and interfere with them at all." I believe in working this thing out in a peaceable way, and according to the Constitution of the United States as our fathers made it.</p> 
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6184-00000039"/> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. The Constitution guarantees to every State the right to regulate its own internal affairs.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. The Constitution has been amended, and can be again.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Yes; could be amended, until it would cease to be the same document.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Still it would be under the rule of the same majority government.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. That rule, though it would not violate the letter, would violate the spirit of the Constitution. I know that you might, by getting a constitutional majority of Free-State men into Congress, amend the Constitution; and, if ratified by three-fourths of the States, you could thus blot out State legislatures, and have uniformity of laws. The house would cease to be divided; but where would be the spirit of the Constitution? Gone, and gone forever! You would have a Union; you would have uniformity of laws. It would not be the uniform of liberty, but of despotism. Our fathers knew, when they framed the Constitution, that the local laws suited to the lumber hills of Maine were not adapted to the rice-fields of South Carolina. That to preserve the union of the States, they must make it a union of nations, and not consolidate the whole into one nation.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. I am for sticking to the Constitution as it is plainly printed and understood. I care nothing for your spirits or ghosts of the Constitution; I want the document itself, and purpose to go by it, and on no consideration will break its provisions. If a portion of our people are getting scared at the Constitution, because it can be lawfully amended, I can't help it, or find for them a remedy; they must take the consequences.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. The consequences fall upon the whole nation; none can escape them.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. "Suppose the disaffected go to war: they can not fight always; they must make peace-can not friends adjust difficulties better than enemies?-and the same difficulties will still stare them in the face."</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Yes; and so long as the Free-State people interfere with slavery-even in an indirect manner-the same difficulties will stare the nation in the face. It is not the slave-driver alone that receives the benefit of slave labor; it is not this nation alone, but the whole civilized world. Destroy slave labor in the Southern States, and you destroy half the prosperity of the nation; and the blow is felt throughout the civilized world. You, in the free States, buy a garment for one dollar. Destroy slave labor, and for the same garment you would have to pay two dollars.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Yes; but if we are willing to pay the two dollars to liberate the slave?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Then you would pay your money to do the slave a great harm.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. You pro-slavery men won't agree to any thing; there is no reason in you.</p> 
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6184-00000040"/> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Yes, we will. We will agree to let you alone, if you will let us alone.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Yes; but the Constitution! We must stick to that.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Good morning; I must be going.</p>

               <p>"NO! I am not mad. Would to heaven I were! Then the cherished memories of the past would not chase each other through my brain, and wreck upon the center rock the ark of all my hopes. O, the flowers of my childhood, my school-girl days, and early married life! How I have watched and tended, with a loving hand, half covered with your sweet perfumes, and ripe ye stood to strew a mortal path! Ah! a frost-a killing frost-that came between the setting and the rising sun, to nip, with such a bitter tooth, the morning of my dream, and leave poor me to winter and to widowhood!"</p> 
               <p>And Mary Hawkeye was aroused from her reverie by the sudden appearance of Rosa and Dolla, clapping their little hands, and exclaiming, "Mamma, uncle is coming, with Big-bobtail Sorrel!"</p> 
               <p>"No, uncle," said Mary; "I will sell the horse. Every thing that was my husband's is dear to me; but necessity, that tyrant of our being, will cause me to part with many things that I would delight to keep."</p> 
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6184-00000041"/> 
               <p>And Mary looked at Rosa and Dolla; something whispered in her heart, "I will part with all but you, and the memories of the past."</p> 
               <p>Mary's parents resided in a distant State. She married against their will, and was disinherited. She had not seen, or heard from them for five years; and now, should she go back, humbled and incumbered? Such a stroke to her feelings was worse than death. Willingly would she have taken the fearful leap into that dark abode from whence no glimmer of light returns. But Rosa and Dolla, in their innocent and childish plays, with their ringing and merry laugh, like two guardian angels, bear up the sinking spirit of their mother, and rescue the life that gave them life-proving to the dark miser and cold-blooded bachelor, that children are the dewdrops of heaven. How oft have they nerved a puny arm to strike again, and battle through the war of life! How tenderly have they closed the dying eyes of aged and honored heads! How cheerfully have they passed the winter's eve, and early sought the morning's cares! The childless man knows not the sweets of earth.</p> 
               <p>Burtice had taken counsel of Mary, with regard to the best domestic arrangements for her future, and departed.</p> 
               <p>Mary was busily arranging her household affairs. Rosa and Dolla sat in solemn council in the back yard.</p> 
               <p>"I do wish so much that uncle had brought Little-bobtail Sorrel, and left that hateful old horse. I do n't like him, for he won't let us ride," said Dolla, indignantly.</p> 
               <p>"Uncle had to bring any one he could get, and he had a hard time to get any," said Rosa, wisely.</p> 
               <p>"Why did he have a hard time?" said Dolla, inquiringly.</p> 
               <p>"Because the men were hard to catch," said Rosa pointedly.</p> 
               <p>"What did uncle do with the man when he catch him?" said Dolla, leaning forward.</p> 
               <p>"Hush!" said Rosa, clapping her little hand on Dolla's mouth. "Uncle <emph>whispered</emph> that to mother."</p>

               <p>"O FATHER! do not go, and leave your only child to the cold decrees of fate-to while the tedious nights away, and dream of death and solitude; to grope along, by day, the dark and bushy path of cold suspense! This humble favor let me ask; and hazard not your gray and honored head in deadly strife. Let Fate or Fortune's hand sweep away the land, the servants, and the house; but give me my father!" And Cora clung bewitchingly to the neck of Colonel S--, beseeching him not to go to Kansas with what her keen judgment now readily detected as a war party. Cora had just returned from a visit to some of her father's old friends and relatives in the East; had seen some of the folly and cold-heartedness of the world; and her feelings clung to her father and her home with the tenacity of inspiration.</p> 
               <p>Judge Traddings was a wealthy and opulent merchant in an Eastern city; was uncle to Cora, by marriage, and the father of two daughters, named, respectively, Nanny and Kate, who had fanned off the flies for seventeen and nineteen summers. They were the belles of the city, riding in a fine carriage, and spending money in reckless profusion. Let us take a peep into the Judge's parlor, and we see Kate, sitting by the window, making a vain endeavor to write poetry in a scrap-book; and hear her murmur, "There is but one step between the sublime and the ridiculous.' I know if my teacher were to see these lines, she would call them ridiculous." She is interrupted by her sister running into the room, exclaiming:</p> 
               <p>"Kate! Kate! have you heard the news?"</p> 
               <p>"No; what is it?" said Kate, anxiously.</p> 
               <p>"Our little country cousin, from the far West, has come to town, and will pay us a call very soon," said Nanny, triumphantly.</p> 
               <p>"Mercy! has any one seen her?" said Kate, eagerly.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Nanny; "old Aunt Keeneye saw her, Sunday, at church."</p> 
               <p>"And how was she dressed?"</p> 
               <p>"You know aunt is so droll that one can never get any thing out of her concerning costume: yet she can tell you if the hair is red, yellow, auburn,<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6184-00000043"/> brown or coal-black; or if the eyes are blue, black, gray or cat-like; or any peculiarity of face or form: but I have no faith in any decision she would make of the color of a bow in a bonnet, whether it was purple or scarlet. This much I learned, however: she was dressed in a plain silk, with only four flounces, and wearing a poor, pitiful ten-dollar pin. Just think of that-and in this city!"</p> 
               <p>"O cracky, what a wench! and raised in a slave State, and her father driving so many servants (poor creatures!)"-and, turning to her wardrobe, Kate continued: "Just look at these ruffles! I kept Biddy<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="WRIGHT2-0653-NOTE002" n="*"
                        place="foot">
                     <p >Biddy, a German servant-girl.</p>
                  </note> up last night until twelve o'clock, ironing them, and now they look like a stake-and-ridered fence. I suppose we will have to dress. Do call Biddy to dust this furniture-no odds if dinner is late. I think papa will dine out to-day." And the fastidious Kate was soon lost in a pile of silks and ribbons; while the maid-of-all-work danced round the parlor with her dusting-brush, leaving her dinner to the care of the kitchen and the house-cat.</p> 
               <p>"What, in the name of all the gods at once, is Cora doing in the kitchen?" said Preston to his better-half, as he walked into the breakfast-room.</p> 
               <p>"She is washing out some of her stockings," said the lady, as she drew up her chair to the table, and continued, with a curl of the lip: "I offered her the services of Bridget,<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="WRIGHT2-0653-NOTE003" n="*"
                        place="foot">
                     <p >Bridget, an Irish servant-girl.</p>
                  </note> but she steadily and positively refused, saying that she always washed her own stockings; that when she trusted to others, they were never white. I believe she is just trying to wait on herself, in order to make us believe that she is not waited on by the negroes at home; for I heard her say that her father had six negro women. Just think of that, Preston! What on earth would I do with six women about this house, when I can scarcely keep Bridget as busy as she ought to be."</p> 
               <p>"The field-the field, madam!" said Preston, vehemently; and, as he tossed the coffee into the saucer, he continued: "They work the women in the field, madam-make them hoe, plow, dig, chop-anything that comes in a busy time. The colored women are almost as stout as the men, and sometimes more profitable to the master than the men."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Polly threw herself back in her chair, with her eyes slightly turned toward the upper country, like the spirit of Cleopatra beholding the ghost of Antony, and exclaimed: "Good Lord! what barbarians those Southerners are!"</p> 
               <p>"Dear," said Preston, when his wife had a little recovered, "there is an important meeting in town to-day, to consider what is best to be done for our friends in Kansas. There is a bold effort being made on the part of pro-slavery men to extend this barbarism into that territory. Have I any clean linen?"</p> 
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6184-00000044"/> 
               <p>The lady rubbed her hand across her forehead, and hesitatingly said: "I don't believe you have. Bridget was up last night until nearly twelve, clearing up and dusting the rooms. I hadn't thought of your shirts; didn't think you would be going to any place particularly. Why didn't you speak of it, and I would have had it done, if it had kept her up all night. I don't care if she is talking about her pay, and grumbling; she is as big and strong as you are, Mr. Preston, and abundantly able, if she is not willing; and let her go, if she wants to: she can't find a place but what there is work to do, and plenty of it. I know I am particular, and so is every body getting these days. If she'd move her dratted carcass a little faster in the daytime, I would n't keep her up so late o' nights. You shall have a shirt, if I have to iron it myself. And do get ready; you are always late at important meetings. You know, Preston," continued the lady, softening her voice, "that you are considered one of the most liberal members of the Church. Do not think of money, when it is needed for our friends in Kansas. It would be but the penance of Christians, if we had to live on bread and water, so our money is spent to put a stop to barbarism. But watch Mr. Dodge and Mr. Squibble; they are as well-to-do as we are; I would n't pay more than others. Have your eyes open," said the lady, as Preston left the room. She then settled down in her chair, murmuring to herself: "No odds if Bridget don't get her pay right off; she don't know how to spend it any how; money is as good as thrown away that is paid to h-e-r."</p> 
               <p>"Nanny, you never did look well without paint; do call Biddy, to bring my painting sponge; you look as white as a gravestone. Hush! did the hall-bell ring?"</p> 
               <p>In a few moments Cora was introduced to the Misses Traddings, and spent the evening. Cora was quite confounded by the numerous questions put to her by the young ladies, concerning the West and the colored servants, all of which she endeavored to answer with dignity and truth; but when they asked her if the colored servants dressed her of a morning, she could contain her dignity no longer, and, laughing immoderately, told them that she had dressed many a one of them-<emph>little ones</emph>-when their mothers would be busy. Cora's conversation with the old man Traddings concerning the West, its broad and beautiful lands-in fact, her intelligent view of our common country; its wide extent, its variety of soil and climate; its adaptation as a home for all races; its wise and beneficent government, as independent States, fraternized upon the basis of equality upon the common center, with the liberty of variation within their own borders. "While each one attends to his own business and disturbs not his neighbors," said Cora, "there is none to make afraid."</p> 
               <p>Judge Traddings thought seriously of sending his daughters abroad, that they might lose some of<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6184-00000045"/> their butterfly pride, and gain a little wholesome understanding.</p> 
               <p>Cora had left home to spend a few months in the East, but, hearing of the Kansas troubles, returned home immediately.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head> 
               <p>IN the State of Tennessee lived Shilo, a man well-to-do in the world. His eldest children having grown up, and the soil of Tennessee having become somewhat dear, Shilo concluded to emigrate West, where he could get plenty of land, and that cheap.</p> 
               <p>Shilo and two of his sons settled at Timber Point, in Kansas Territory, taking claims of land, or preemption rights. Several other slave-State men also settled in the same neighborhood. This was regarded as a pro-slavery settlement.</p> 
               <p>Shilo had a personal difficulty with one of Major Six's men, early after his first settlement in the territory, which had been partly arranged, and all seemed to go right. But an old grudge, like a chronic, festering sore, may heal and grow smooth without; within, a secret, subtle, poisonous matter lies close concealed, till some unlucky, wanton lick breaks the skin: then comes forth the poisonous matter, corroding all the flesh.</p> 
               <p>Shilo was an extreme pro-slavery man; and, after the commencement of hostilities, the injured Freesoiler<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6184-00000046"/> soiler found little difficulty in exciting a mob to march against Shilo. By industry and the means Shilo obtained for his farm and a few slaves, in Tennessee, they had all made very comfortable homes in Kansas. They were all great talkers, and banterers of the anti-slavery party, and had formed the acquaintance of many of the leading pro-slavery men of Missouri.</p> 
               <p>Timber Point had become a noted place of rendezvous for the Missourians. Shilo was in high hopes of inaugurating slavery in Kansas; was active and efficient in giving course to the political destiny of the day. He was much troubled with night reflections, after recent occurrences in the territory; for his Missouri friends could not save him when they were in their own State.</p> 
               <p>One night, when lying snugly in his bed, halfway between the land of dreams and the latitude of real life, the soft and hollow sound of "Halloo!" danced within his ear. Shilo anticipated a call from some pro-slavery friends that night, and was completely off his guard. Leaving his whole family in the sweet embrace of sleep (save his unsuspecting wife, who thought him with friends), he joined the hailing party. His blood ran cold and faltered in his veins, when he was coolly informed, with firearms pointed at his heart, that silence was the price of his life.</p> 
               <p>The party marched slowly away with the unwilling man. The pledges given, or the pledges asked; the crime charged; the testimony of the witnesses; the action of the jury and the judge, are not recorded; and no historian has told the story of the execution. The two sons of Shilo escaped the mob, but not without sufficient evidence that they were pursued.</p> 
               <p>When daylight tiptoed on the eastern hills, casting a piercing glance through western vales, these men returned to quiet homes, to silence Rumor's tongue, and talk with doubtful men concerning the fate of Kansas.</p> 
               <p>Ned had seen Dutch Bob; and, after a long conversation, had come to the conclusion that the territory was not a healthy country, and made preparations to go back to Kentucky.</p> 
               <p>The sudden disappearance of Shilo was a sufficient excuse for his two sons to quit the country. Some said they went back to Tennessee; others, that they went to Missouri, and joined Burtice. Be this as it may, the Free-State men began, about this time, to get hold of the reins of the government of Kansas.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head> 
               <p>"THIS is the seventh day that I have labored in the harvest field of Shephard," said Freelabor to his companion in want, as he lay down a small sack of flour upon his door-step. Then, seating himself by its side, and wiping off the sweat from his face with his shirt-sleeve, continued: "About four o'clock this evening the sun came down like a caravan of heated gas from the burning mountain; and four acres of the golden grain waved before us. My hand trembled like an aspen leaf when I attempted to whet my scythe. We all wished to close the harvest, and receive our pay. I thought of you and the little ones. I asked Tom to whet my scythe, while I bathed my face and arms in cold water; and, as the sun left us, we built the last shock in that whole plantation of a field. When we were all gathered in, Shephard very politely informed us that, having failed to negotiate a bill, he could not pay us for a few days. You know I always had a proud spirit. So I took Shephard to one side, that our wants might reach no man's ear but his, and told him that I was not particular; that he might pay me along as it suited; but I was in great need of a little at the present time. And he said he had n't a <emph>five-center</emph> in the wide world. I hesitated. I looked all over the farm: the stacks of golden grain met my eye in every direction, and I took courage, and told Shephard that my wife and little children had no supper. He said the best he could do was to give me an order to the store. I said to myself, 'any port in a storm;' then told him I would have to take it. I went to the store, and asked Simpson the price of flour: he said I could have this sack (and Freelabor brought his hand down on the bag with a loud slap) for two dollars; and when I presented the order, said he must <emph>shave</emph> it ten per cent. And thus it is ever: those who save the grain get the least benefit of it."</p> 
               <p>While we leave the good woman preparing supper for the tired man and his children, we will turn and listen to one more conversation between Jeff and Abe, who are now at hand, having heard the conversation of Freelabor.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Freelabor sometimes meets with hardships; but the man is free to go and labor for one who will pay him more promptly.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. That is very true; but still he has no guarantee against disappointment. It is a poor support that any man makes by labor alone; he must handle his wages with care, and bring a portion of them to bear interest, in some shape; must have something laid up for a rainy day, and manage his labor as skillfully as the capitalist manages his capital, or he<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6184-00000048"/> can not prosper. You had as well prate about free capital as free labor.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. P-r-e-c-i-s-e-l-y. I would have both free. Capital is free, and so should labor be.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Then, to put the slave laborer on a level with the free laborer, you must give him the same social position; for, if you deny him that, you cripple his capabilities; deny him the means of making a calculator, and his main dependence is, at last, upon his labor. Consequently he must cheapen it upon the better informed.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. That to free all men would reduce labor, I can not deny; but, at the same time, it would reduce capital in some localities, and some who now live by capital would have to live by labor.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Then you would reduce the wages, by bringing more hands into the field.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Yes; but it would give all an equal chance.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. That would be right, if all men were equal.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. There you go off the handle again. You are eternally upon inequality, or frightened at complexion. I admit that men are not equal in every particular, but hold that, in the great essentials, they are the same. When a man is black, is he not a man, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same medicine? If you humble him, will he not fear? If you praise him, will he not hope? If you feed him, will he not rejoice? If you poison him, will he not die, the same as a white man? You must prove to me that he is not, a man, before I can consent that you have the right to hold him as a slave.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. There are many strange things in the world. If I have a prejudice against color, you certainly have a prejudice against the word <emph>slave.</emph> All men are slaves to something. The laboring classes of all countries, or, at least, a very large portion of them, are slaves of necessity; and, of the higher classes, some are the slaves of idleness-some of intemperance-some of unruly tongues-some of scolding women-and some of the devil.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. But you have shown no good reason why color should condemn a man to slavery; neither can you support the institution upon any such foundation. It is a known historical fact, that color is but the effect of climate or temperature. Stripped of exterior coverings, there is a common body and a common mind. Inferiority arises from abuse; and there is no excuse for slavery but that of the exercise of political power, which is not justified by reason, religion, or nature.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. I am disposed to take the world as I find it. The history of man shows a system of slavery among all nations. It is like every thing else; it is varied in its regulations. The poor are the slaves of the rich; the fools are the slaves of the wise; the sluggards are the slaves of the industrious; the negligent the slaves of the careful. For instance: the rich buy their goods at wholesale prices-the poor, at retail. The poor support the merchant, and an undue portion of every other burden. The wise<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6184-00000049"/> take advantage of the times; the fool labors hard for his folly; the industrious gather the first fruits of the season; the sluggard labors and slaves out of the thorns and briers a pittance that is but the price of slothfulness. As to any justification by reason, we only see that it is so. Without stopping to examine any principles of religion, we can only say, in the language of the great Teacher, "Render to Csar the things that are Csar's"-clearly showing that religion is not political; and, as to its being against nature, we not only see it in all nations of men, but in other fields of nature. Dr. Laycock remarks: "There is hardly a mechanical pursuit in which INSECTS do not excel. They are excellent weavers, house-builders, architects; they make diving-bells, bore galleries, raise vaults, construct bridges; they line their houses with tapestry, clean them, ventilate them, and close them, with admirably-fitted swinging doors; they build and store warehouses, construct traps in the greatest variety, hunt skillfully, rob, and plunder; they poison, saber and stab their enemies; they have social laws, a common language, <emph>divisions of labor, and gradations of rank;</emph> they maintain armies, go to war, send out scouts, appoint sentinels, carry off prisoners, KEEP SLAVES, and tend domestic animals."</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Go with me into one of the highly civilized countries of Europe, and witness the coronation of a monarch, on the throne of his ancestors, surrounded by an august assembly of peers, barons, and abbots. Then turn to a hamlet in Negroland, and witness the sable race in the hour of recreation, and dancing to barbarous music. Or, behold the solitary den of the Bushman, where the lean and hungry savage crouches in silence, like a beast of prey, watching, with eager eyes, the creatures which enter his pitfall. Then behold the doctrine: "All men are of a common stock." Can you, then, say to me that we must take things as we find them, and think not of reformation?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Reformation comes as gently as the dew from heaven. If you would reform a man, go not about his angry parts, nor stir the passions of his head, or call him mean, or try to pull him down; touch not his purse, or try to level down his pride; do n't say he owes a lasting debt, as huge as mountains are, to all the world. But touch him in his tender parts, and say, "A beast has feelings." The noble orb of heaven looks down with mercy on the weak, and, lavish with his friendly rays, bids all to rise. Ye noble son, that stands above the mass of slavish, ignorant men, bid all good cheer, and each performs his appointed part; and He that rules the lightnings and the storms will loose our bonds in His own good time. If you would reform a government, break not the strings that stay the noble staff, and with your heated breath blow down its glorious flag. Nor go about with counterfeited salve, to heal the sores on the body politic; but wash with friendly water the sounder parts, and time will make the cure.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Such patience is not the lot of men. The<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6184-00000050"/> name that lives when we are dead stirs up the boldness of the soul to wind the trumpet of our fame, and herald freedom through the land.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. And such a blast from mortal horn ne'er rested in the ears of men-a chilling blast, that winters half the continent, and withers all the flowers, sweet blown for eighty years. The martial echo dries up the spring and weather-beats the summer; makes mild men mad, and mad men devils. To blot the cheek of fame with such virtuous blood, the broadest river that flows from crystal fount, through history's vale, will never wash it out.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Storms purify the air. Though thunders roll and lightnings gleam, winds upturn, and hailstones pelt the quiet state of man, they are, at last, but a necessary thing. Generations yet unborn will bask in the sunshine that follows this approaching storm.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Civil discord is a woeful thing-the fevered blood that, heated in the veins, beats hard against the skin, then rushing to the heart for force, comes bounding through the scarlet streams, and dries the skin with the swiftness of its gait; add but to the fury of its speed, and soon it runs its course: the man is dead. But, checked with milder means, and softened in its flight, it presses gently to the skin, and mildly fills the heart; the head is cooled by its gentle flood: behold, the man is better.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Mildness is at some times good; but doctors now dispute. Some say, to heat a fevered man will sooner make him cool. A middle course we think is best; and doing what we are seeming not to do, will so disguise the course of the disease, and purge out the hotness of the blood, and leave the wasted frame to gather up its wanton strength, and show the world a man that never stood so proud.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. You may, with skillful hand, mix up a pill for inward draught, composed of counterparts, and pass it through the body without distort. But mixing physic for the mind muddies up the sight and leaves you groping in the dark, without the friendly aid of day to show you where you stand.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. A stubborn, set distemper takes harsh and heavy physic, with necromancing hand, to purge the blood of imperfections, or amputate the disaffected parts. We will rid this body of disease, or give it out u-n-t-o the world we are no doctors.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. The world still needs no testimony. When many doctors set about a complicated old disease, some urging amputation, others bitter, poisonous drugs-that man's case is dangerous.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head> 
               <p>THE golden rays of the western sun glittered on the muddy waters of the turbulent Missouri. The eastern bank was alive with busy men; drays, horse-carts, and wagons thickly crowded the muddy wharf. The fine passenger packet "Mettlefoot" was moored at the landing; the black smoke was rolling out of her smoke-stacks; the fiery steam from her boilers was singing with a low, deadly hiss, distinctly audible for four hundred yards. The captain stood on the main-deck, with one hand on the large brass bell, while with the other he was pointing to the spring-line, directing a sailor to throw it loose. His eye met in the distance a coachman, urging his horses, almost at full speed, directly toward the boat. "Hold," said the captain, "one moment," as with both hands he rolled over the huge bell in its orbit; and its iron tongue poured forth its notes through the timbered land and up and down the river, as though it said to all concerned, "Hurry up; we will soon be off." The coachman pressed his horses, for in that carriage sat a passenger-a young lady returning to the loved ones at home. The notes of the bell ran through her mind like the darts of Cupid. Did she wish for wings, to fly to the noble steamer? No, she wished, from the depths of her heart, that the wheels would run off the carriage, or something else would detain her at the river for a short time; but prudence compelled her to smother all of those feelings, and Cora was conducted safely into the ladies' saloon of the "Mettlefoot." The noble boat was soon steaming through the dark and muddy waters of the Missouri, Cora, having been introduced to the captain, who was a warm friend of her father's was most interestingly entertained for a short time. The captain was called out, and Cora went into her state-room. Throwing herself down upon the berth, she exclaimed, mentally: "O, my God! could that have been him? <q>

               <p>"O my God! could that be him in such mean attire, tending sheep? And what a noble look he gave me! In that face I saw the morning sun, that lighted up the day of all my hopes, and moored the night in iron bands, that held my love so long in a<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6184-00000052"/> prison-house; a momentary day, that came like heaven's gleam, and darted quick away. And Fate rolled on the carriage-wheels with such a barbarous speed, while pale-faced Fear crept o'er my soul, and bade me not to speak. When homeward-bound, with such an aching heart, to woo a father from such a desperate game! And what a plight I'm in, wafting home on a lightning train! Here are my feet, my arms, my voice, too; but where's my heart? "This yonder with a shepherd boy!"</p> 
               <p>In the prosperous years of 1858-9, Mr. -- bought sheep in Missouri, to drive to Kansas, Texas, and California. On a certain trip of this kind, Don Partlo accompanied him to Missouri. Mr.-- purchased a large flock of sheep, and had driven them west, and was near the Missouri River, when a carriage passed them in full drive. In that carriage sat Cora, returning home from the East, with the memory of the Misses Traddings fresh in her mind. The thoughts of her father and the loved ones at home were crowding through her mind, when every thing else was all at once upset by the sight of Don Partlo, up to his knees in the dust, tending the sheep.</p>

                     <p>DISCORD is a hateful thing; the apple of a heathen tree, of Grecian shape and golden hue, thrown by the gods among contentious men. Ever since that fatal day has rolled around the world, to ruffle and disturb the quiet state of man-in every age and every clime, in high and low degree, the apple of discord gilds its way and hardens the hearts of men.</p>
                  </q> 
               </epigraph> 
               <p>"BUT here is Tom Slaver; he will want to know my reasons for leaving the territory." And Ned summed up his best recollections of his sojourn in Kansas.</p> 
               <p>"Good morning, Ned! you have lost faith in the Indian country, and come back, with belt, cup, and blanket, to old Kentuck. You look well. I heard that you said the country was unhealthy-what on earth is the matter? I thought that you had one of the most beautiful farms in the whole territory."</p> 
               <p>A low, cunning smile hung in the corner of Tom's mouth, while his keen, blue eye looked on Ned as though it would pierce the inmost secrets of his soul.</p> 
               <p>"Well, to tell you the plain truth, there are men in Kansas who never owned a slave in the world,<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6184-00000053"/> who do every thing in their power to afflict that virgin territory with the curse of slavery."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! Do they try to compel a man to own a slave against his will?"</p> 
               <p>"O, no! but they want the institution in the country."</p> 
               <p>"Is there any sin in that? If I choose to work horses on my farm, and you choose to work mules, why should we disagree?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; but you know slavery makes men lazy when they have a negro to send to work: they grow indolent, and their children are not put through; they call the negro for every thing, and let the white family go idle. You know, if you want a thing well done, you must do it yourself. A slave community never prospers like a free community."</p> 
               <p>"So some people say, but I can not see it. What right has one man to say to another that he may own some kinds of property, and other kinds he shall not own?"</p> 
               <p>"O! I know an individual has no such right; but a State can determine what shall be property in her borders, and what shall not."</p> 
               <p>"Well, before a territory becomes a State, why should not all have equal rights? Upon what principle do you wish to exclude Slave-State men from the territories?"</p> 
               <p>"Because slavery has already cursed enough territory. I want to stop it where it is, and let it break down with its own weight."</p> 
               <p>"Then, what you would not destroy at a single blow, you would destroy by the slow process of time."</p> 
               <p>"Exactly!"</p> 
               <p>"But, Ned, if you wish to make Kansas a free State, why did you flee from the territory?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I love my own life more than I hate slavery. The Missourians go over there and excite the pro-slavery men, and then slip back to their own State, and leave the poor devils the bag to hold; and the Free-State men are dealing roughly with them. They have got at it on both sides; so, when a man lies down at night, he don't know whether he will get up in the morning or not. Three of the slave-drivers paid the forfeit before I left there, right in my own neighborhood. That, you know, created a great excitement, and the Free-State men gathered at Timber Point, and Burtice, an infernal Missourian, came over with a band of his bloody followers, and rushed upon them, behind some wagon-loads of hay, and dispersed the whole crowd. Then, you see, he slips back to Missouri, and the Free-State men have no show at him. The Missourians interfere with our elections; and the pro-slavery men of Kansas are trying to establish the institution by the sword, and they get no little help from Missouri. The Free-State men can't get at the Missourians; and the pro-slavery men of the territory pay the forfeit."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; but Ned, you are not pro-slavery."</p> 
               <p>"I know that I am not; but the Free-State men catch it occasionally. I tell you this d--d Burtice<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6184-00000054"/> will hang an Abolitionist as quick as he would a dog."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; but, Ned, I never understood you to be an Abolitionist."</p> 
               <p>"Well, you know that a man has to take sides, and as I am a Free-State man, I am reckoned with that party by all such fellows as Burtice."</p> 
               <p>"It seems that Burtice is somewhat of a terror to the Abolitionists."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! he is a bad man."</p> 
               <p>"Why do n't the Abolitionists stop his wind?"</p> 
               <p>"Why did n't Jack eat his supper?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, Ned, what sort of a country is Kansas?"</p> 
               <p>"The larger portion of it is no country at all, unless you call an ocean of prairie a country. There are some good streaks of country about through it. Wherever there is a stream of water, you will find about a mile of country on each side of it. The land is fertile enough, but it rains there by the job. If the weather-king do n't happen to take a job of raining during the cropping-season, you raise nothing."</p> 
               <p>"Then there is not much use for the negro in Kansas."</p> 
               <p>"No use in the world, sir, if men could only see it. 'T is only those suspicious Missourians; they do n't like to be surrounded by free States."</p> 
               <p>"If States to their own affairs would but attend, and leave their neighbors be, no strife or discord would molest the bridal of the nation."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head> 
               <p>THE broad acres of a plantation hemmed the southern bank of the beautiful Ohio. The crystal waters of that placid stream washed the pebbles on the border of a Virginia farm. Four hundred yards from the margin of the river stood a story-and-a-half house. A lone shade-tree in the front yard gave the premises a lonesome look, which was contrasted by the merry sports of a dozen negroes, the property of Captain Sturn. It was Saturday, and the sun was low. Captain Sturn was in the habit of tasking his negroes by the week, and their work was almost universally completed by Friday night. Saturday and Sunday were spent by these happy people on the margin of the river, fishing and hunting.</p> 
               <p>Three miles from the plantation, in the back room of a coffee-house in a country village, sat two men, by a small, square table, upon which was a bottle of wine; the surface of the table was partly covered with playing-cards. The younger of the two gentlemen was apparently about thirty-five years of age, with a ghostlike complexion and keen, blue eyes; the<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6184-00000055"/> elder was rather corpulent, with red face and heavy brows. The game is finished. The pale man handed the bottle to the other, as he said, "Captain Sturn, take a little more wine, and you will play a stronger game."</p> 
               <p>"I will take the wine," said the Captain, as he tossed the red element into the tumbler, "but I am tired of playing. "He drank the wine with trembling nerve, and buried his face in his hands.</p> 
               <p>"You seem sad, Captain; you have lost a dear wife and a son, and your eldest daughter <emph>disinherited.</emph>" After a pause, during which the Captain looked up, the pale-faced man continued: "If, by the providence of God, Mary should be your only heir, would you revoke that <emph>disinheritance?</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"I have set my seal upon it!" and the Captain straightened up as he brought his fist down upon the table, and continued, "and, by the Eternal God--"</p> 
               <p>"Stand back!"-"A fight! a fight!" rang through the hall. The Captain and the pale man rushed into the front room.</p> 
               <p>Late rains had swollen the bosom of the gentle Ohio, whose waters, near its junction with the Father of waters, met the fine Western steamer "Harvest moon." On that steamer there was a sad, but interesting passenger: it was Mary Hawkeye, returning to the home of her childhood. Recent occurrences in Kansas had prevented Burtice from rendering her necessary aid. The creditors of Hawkeye had taken almost every thing which she had. Mary had been raised by a tender and indulgent mother. Her father was a stern and hard man; but Mary had determined to go once more to that roof from which she had fled, against her father's will and strict command. She said in her heart, "I will act the 'Prodigal Son'-I will go to the feet of my father and say, I have sinned against him and against Heaven! Yes, I will do it, for the sake of my children." And Mary pressed Rosa and Dolla to her bosom, and gave vent to those friendly tears which can only relieve a bruised and lacerated heart. The "Harvest-moon" was crowded with passengers. The state-room which was given to Mary and her little ones was also occupied by a young lady, whose Christian name is Ophelia, and whose father and mother occupied the adjoining room.</p> 
               <p>The falls of the Ohio had been passed. Rosa and Dolla were nestled together in the bed, and Mary sat by them with a hopeful smile. Ophelia was near the window, intently poring over the pages of a book. Low groans were distinctly audible in the adjoining room, when Mary was startled by the shrill sound of "Ophelia! Ophelia!" The young girl pays no attention, but continues to ravish the book. Mary opens her Bible and reads from the Prophet Jeremiah-"Man is strange and wonderfully made;" then mentally continued, as she looked at Ophelia, "and woman is the wonder of creation."</p> 
               <p>Smothered and low groans again disturbed the silence of the evening. "Ophelia! Ophelia!" in<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6184-00000056"/> louder tones, again rang through the room. The girl paid no attention. Mary laid her hand upon the young girl's shoulder, saying, "Ophelia, you are called."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, ma'am, in a minute," said the girl, continuing to read. The groans continued, and again Ophelia was called.</p> 
               <p>Forbearance ceased to be a virtue, and Mary caught the young girl by the shoulders, and, shaking her, said, "Ophelia, you are called; your father is very sick. What on earth are you reading?"</p> 
               <p>"The last new novel."</p> 
               <p>"And pray what is its title?"</p> 
               <p>"'<hi rend="i"/>Dead Loads of Love,' by Honeymoon Lockheart, the author of 'Love in a Hail-storm,' etc., etc."</p> 
               <p>"My child, your father is very ill. They have called you a dozen times."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; just let me finish this chapter;" then saying, mentally, "Let's see how the next one commences," she turns over a leaf-</p> 
               <p>"Ophelia!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I do declare, it commences with my name; let's see a little of her character."</p> 
               <p>And the girl was soon again lost in the mysteries of the book.</p> 
               <p>The Rock Landing was passed. Doctor Solomon had taken passage, and was called to the sick man's room. Mary leaned against the partition, to hear the consultation. Then, starting suddenly, she exclaimed: "O God! Ophelia, your father has the small-pox!"</p> 
                
               <p>Ophelia gave one scream, threw down the book, and rushed into the room.</p> 
               <p>The notes of the iron tongue of the great bell danced upon the waters, up and down the river.</p> 
               <p>"What does that mean?" said Mary, to one of the cabin-boys, as he passed her door.</p> 
               <p>"Sturn's Landing, madam," was the cool reply.</p> 
               <p>"O my God!" Said Mary, clasping her hands; "is the trial upon me! and exposed to the small-pox!"</p> 
               <p>Something seemed to whisper in Mary's ear-"There is no escape." She hastily prepared herself, with Rosa and Dolla, for the shore.</p> 
               <p>"Let me carry this package, madam," said the polite porter, as she left the room.</p> 
               <p>The face of day was hiding one check behind a dark cloud that hung in the western horizon; a dozen; a negroes were standing on the brink of the river, anxiously gazing at the boat. Mary and her two children were set upon the pebbly shore. One of the negroes hallooed, in a wild, mellow voice-"Miss Mary! Miss Mary!" The whole crowd rushed upon the trembling woman: one caught up Rosa, another one Dolla; and Old Sue, who had been the nurse of Mary's childhood, caught her up in her arms-and all started toward the house.</p> 
               <p>The reader will be interested with a conversation that now took place between an Eastern and Western lady, passengers on the "Harvest-moon:"</p> 
               <p>E. I suppose that lady is an advocate, with her<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6184-00000057"/> father and her people, of emancipation, that those poor creatures are so glad to see her.</p> 
               <p>W. You much mistake yourself, madam, if you think so: they never think of emancipation, unless it is handed to them by white people. There appears to be an innate principle in the negro that teaches him his inferiority: he naturally looks to the white man for protection. There is nothing more true than that the negro loves his master.</p> 
               <p>E. Merciful heavens! how you talk!</p> 
               <p>W. Do not children love their parents-do not wards love their guardians-as a general thing?</p> 
               <p>E. Yes; but they sometimes change when they become of age.</p> 
               <p>W. Negroes never become of age in this country.</p> 
               <p>On the way to the house, Mary learned from the negroes that her mother was dead, and her father was much dissipated; and that he was from home, in the neighboring village-probably intoxicated.</p> 
               <p>Rosa and Dolla sat in the chimney-corner, like two little culprits. Mary raised up gracefully as Captain Sturn entered the room: she flew to her father's neck; he pressed her from him.</p> 
               <p>"Hear me, O father!"</p> 
               <p>The Captain listened. Mary told her story.</p> 
               <p>"Killed by the Abolitionists! by G-d! where is my will? By h-ll! you shall be reinstated!"</p> 
               <p>And the Captain sent for his lawyer.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head> 
               <p>I WAS at the house of Burtice in the spring of 1861. A temporary peace had been restored between Kansas and Missouri. Burtice had enlarged his farm; his family were industrious and interesting. The exciting season of the presidential election had passed over. Missourians, as a general thing, seemed willing to abide the result, saying that the President had been constitutionally elected.</p> 
               <p>Burtice said the spirit of the Constitution had been violated. The people said the South had acted their part in such violation by running John C. Breckinridge. Groups of men were seen in earnest conversation; and Burtice said a new era had dawned upon the political horizon: seven States had withdrawn from the Union, and it became Missouri to determine her political destiny.</p> 
               <p>Leaving him to talk with his old friends, of war and desolation, I was again interested in another conversation between Jeff and Abe.</p> 
               <p>Jeff, having been absent from the neighborhood for some time, was met by his friend Abe. After<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6184-00000058"/> the usual salutation, the following conversation ensued:</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. As you are just from the city, I suppose you have heard the news. The traitors have fired the first gun; they have fired upon the flag of the United States; that flag dedicated to the memory of every American heart, by the association of the memories of our ancient struggles for the invigorating name of liberty; the flag that waved o'er the heads of our fathers on the hard-fought fields of the Revolution; the flag that robed the pride of the officer, and gladdened the eyes of the private; that flag that waved in the breeze at the head of victorious columns, to cheer the spirits of the heart-stricken widow, whose husband had fallen beneath its folds, consecrated to the liberty of his country: that flag has been fired upon by traitors. Fort Sumter has fallen!</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Shakspeare said a rose would smell as sweet by any other name. A flag is but an emblem of political rule. When politics have undergone a serious, blighting change, their ancient emblem does not fitly represent them. The metal of the past, as pure as gold to every true-made heart, can not be changed for a counterfeit.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. The President has called upon the loyal States for seventy-five thousand warlike men, to take the bloody path, and bear aloft the Union flag. Governor Fox, of our State, has refused to furnish one. What do you think of that?</p> 
                
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. The Governor says it is wicked; and he fears the people, for they are against coercion.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. True; but we must not fight the flag. For policy, in our State, let us arm and stand neutral.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Sooner or later, we must fall upon one or the other side. Better start right at first.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. To go upon an unknown sea, whose bosom no craft has ever borne, to battle in uncertain waves, and breast a storm of such magnitude that northern winds may force upon us, I think is dangerous. Missouri lies with loyal States. The President talks pro-slavery; I am for the Union. I would not risk the crazy craft of Dixie, with nothing but a <emph>sable</emph> anchor.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Cotton is king. The world would starve without it, and it can not be produced without the slave. Is there any faith in the government? Is it not abolitionized? Does it not woo Missouri for a cause, and seek her disinthrallment? The President talks pro-slavery; but such an outward pressure bears upon him he can't be trusted.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Missouri is a noble State, with a hundred thousand fighting men. Why was she not consulted in this affair? Secession is a sinful thing-to raise an arm against a government that never did us harm; on the contrary, like a fostering mother, has put forth an iron arm for our protection. "How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child."</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. There is a time in the affairs of men most critical. Suppose we take a buffalo-hunt; have thirteen<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6184-00000059"/> teen in the mess, and, by fair play and good luck, increase our company to thirty-four; we then elect a captain to lead the chase. When fresh recruits are coming in, and our captain gives it out that he wants no more Missourians, then seven of the old thirteen will not go upon the plains under such an imputation. What, then, should that Missourian do that's caught in such a crowd? Follow a leader who wants no more like him-his kindred all behind! I would not venture the trip.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. When turning back is not permitted, he had better tread in peace the forward track.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Whenever 't is set forth by any set of men, that they want no more of a certain stripe, it portends no good to those they have. I would break their company.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. There is old Virginia, the glorious Old Dominion, rendered sacred by every line in her history-the mother of statesmen and of States; let her take the lead, and then 't will be time enough for Missouri; and, sooner or later, go where she will, her people will stand divided.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. The men who came in early times to settle in Missouri, and make for themselves quiet homes-who beat the brambles and the briers; who chased out the wolf and the wild-cat; who planted schools, and made the State-were pro-slavery men. And now new levies are coming in from foreign States, like beardless boys, to chase gray-headed sires out, and it is thought no sin; while secession is held to be a desperate thing.</p> 
                
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Stick to the Union then, and all is safe. The negro is not worth much in our State; besides, I think we could sell him to the Government, and then we would swim with every loyal State.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. In ancient times, some two it took to make a lasting trade; but now, forsooth, we trade with Circumstances. Where is the Constitution?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. So great a good could not be done in all the land of freedom; unborn millions yet to come will praise the day that disinthralled their fathers from this sin. The President holds in high respect the border States.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. The President is forced to stand with one foot on the Constitution, and the other on party platforms. He puts me in mind of Tom Moore, rafting logs. Now, in the back-water of a certain creek, Tom pushed in a pine and a butternut, then, striding them both, he stood and pushed toward the stream; when to the current he approached, one went south and one went north, and Tom went headlong into the stream, and swam within an inch of life to make the shore. He was then met by a friend, who said, "Which way, Tom?" "Cuss those infernal logs," Tom said. "If I had 'em I would split 'em into rails; but rafting in such d--d water is a <emph>big job.</emph>"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head> 
               <p>DURING the summer of 1861 many citizens of Kansas enlisted in the service of the United States. Major Six received an appointment and a command in the service from a superior officer. He lost no time in organizing a command of such men as he thought partook, with himself, of a certain deadly hatred of Missourians, who were willing to take every advantage of the laws of war to carry out their nefarious designs, and who were willing to run before the President, and carry out such measures as their highly prejudiced minds supposed to be the object of the Government, among which were the confiscation of property and the liberation of slaves belonging to "Secesh." Don Partlo had volunteered, taken the oath, and was a promising young sergeant in the forces of Major Six. It had been loudly given out that the Union men of Missouri were in great need of protection from the insult and abuse of unrelenting "Secesh;" that Confederate flags were flying all over the State, and Union men were being driven from their homes. It was probably thought necessary, by the Government, to send Union soldiers into the State to stop the progress of revolution, and teach the "Secesh" that their neighbors were not to be insulted by the Stars and Bars. Major Six had determined to cross the line with a small force, to give a little instruction by way of taking contraband property and freeing slaves. An old gentleman lived at no great distance from the Kansas line, in Missouri, enjoying a fine farm and driving a fine lot of slaves, and also enjoying the reputation of being a "Secesh." Major Six said it would be well to commence on him. His reputation as a soldier had not departed from the mind of Major Six, since the Missouri raids into Kansas, and more especially the reputation of his fast friend Burtice. It was, therefore, thought best to approach his domicile with great caution, and the Major called around him his most trusty friends in solemn council, to decide the time and manner of attack, and what was to be done. The decision was made; the time was to be in the night; the gentleman was to be arrested, charged with a high crime, thrown into prison, and his slaves set at liberty. This part, however, was known only to the Major and a few of his trusty advisers.</p> 
               <p>It was thought necessary to send a reconnoitering party in daylight to pass the residence of this gentleman, for the purpose of observing the situation of affairs. Consequently the Major detailed Don Partlo, in citizen's guise, to pass the aforesaid residence, as<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6184-00000061"/> a sharp look-out. It was thought necessary to apprise Don of the whole thing-the plan of attack, the intentions of the party, etc., etc.-that his mind should be fully open to the observation of every thing that might retard the onset.</p> 
               <p>The shades of evening were slowly marching out from ambush; the shadow of the poplar had traveled to the eastern side of the house, in the yard of Colonel S--. The rose-bush near its base was holding out its leaves in anticipation of the dews of night. Close by it sat Cora, her fingers busily plying her needle, and her sweet lips humming the tune of "Long, long Ago."</p> 
               <p>A young man rode leisurely up the road. Cora, by instinct as it were, rose to go to the house, as she thought she was imprudently too near the road. She looked again at the young man, and she could not go. There was something in the outlines of that stranger that paralyzed her nerves. She stood as motionless as marble, a statue of female beauty, as enchanting as the fairies of a lover's dream. Don Partlo, true to his mission, scanned the premises of Colonel S--, until his eye rested upon Cora, and his horse would not pass the stiles. An interview ensued, (which I will not undertake to describe, for the lack of capacity to do so.) One hour after the above occurrence, Don Partlo was riding off in the direction from whence he came, and in mental conversation thus delivers himself: "O, true love is a lasting thing! Like water in the bosom of the earth, it seeks some lone and hidden cavern in which to gather strength, and form a heart to pulsate through some new-found vein, and wet the tongue of thirsty man. A crystal fount, deep hidden in the breast, will live through long and tedious days, pulsing out by minute drops, until some coming storm o'erflows the heart. Those brilliant eyes, like lightning in a thick-set cloud; that soft and mellow voice that thundered in my ears; the crystal drops that stood upon her cheeks, is rain enough to last a hundred years. My heart is full and overflowed; and yet it will hold true love enough to fill a vein with gentle drops, until I grow as gray as frost. Honor is a sacred thing; but robbery is dark enough to break the gates of heaven. To raise a knife and cut my throat, is madness. To spoil this house, and forfeit love, is wretchedness. To do it, or to let it be done, is all the same. Death is the wages of desertion; but to execute is a two-handed game. Don Partlo is a deserter!"</p> 
               <p>Cora had told Don Partlo where he would find Burtice. He held a short interview with that gentleman, and then proceeded to the head-quarters of Major Six, and reported all quiet.</p> 
               <p>When Don Partlo had left, Cora hastily concealed every thing valuable about the house that could be carried off, and, unknown to the negroes, went to a neighbor's house, about a mile distant, to remain through the night.</p> 
               <p>About nine o'clock, Major Six, at the head of thirty nine men, all mounted and armed with musket, saber, and holster, was ready to march on the aforesaid<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6184-00000062"/> said expedition. Don Partlo was taken suddenly ill, which caused some detention to the party, and a council was held to give up the trip for that night. But after receiving minute directions from him, between the paroxysms of his sufferings, the Major concluded to go forward. When the party were fairly out of sight, Don Partlo grew suddenly better, mounted his charger, and telling the guard that he would overtake them, dashed off at full speed. Long before the party under Major Six arrived at the residence of Colonel S--, Don Partlo was with Burtice, who, by this time, was at the head of a small party, armed with double barreled shot-guns, and posted in a thick cluster of brush near the road, west of the Colonel's house. In a short time Major Six and his party filed slowly along, having dismounted a quarter of a mile from the house, and detailed every fourth man to hold their horses. Burtice and his men permitted the Major to pass; they marched up to the house, surrounding it on all sides. The Major hailed. No answer was returned. Another hail, still louder, received no answer. A rock that lay in the front yard bounced against the door, and broke it open. The noise, by this time, raised the colored population. They came swarming around, and informed the Major that the white folks had happened out, but as to their whereabouts, no one could tell. The Major began to smell a rat. He had no clue to any suspicion; but, evidently, something was wrong. The Colonel's residence was searched from cellar to garret, not so much for contraband of war, as to find some clue to the run of the ropes. Nothing of value could be found; and the men began to whisper one to another, "BURTICE, by G-d!" The Major detested failure; and he determined to take something. Calling the negroes all up, he told them that they were free; but, in order to enjoy their liberty, for the present, they would have to go to Kansas; that he would give them an escort; and to saddle all the horses on the place, as they were entitled to them for their past services; that their master was a rebel, and would be hung. The stable was soon opened, and, behold! no horses were there. "BURTICE!" again ran through the crowd, in almost audible whispers. Nothing now seemed to be left for them to do but to make a cautious retreat. The Major informed the negroes that the young and active ones could go with them; that the aged and very young would have to wait for a more favorable opportunity. The retreat was commenced toward the horses-not down the road, the nearest route, but through an open field. Burtice, discovering the course of the enemy, ordered a charge into the field. For a few moments, the volley of guns broke the stillness of the dark night. The Major's party went on double-quick to their horses-the negroes back to the house, with the exception of an enthusiastic girl, who, being a little in advance of her fellows, when the run commenced, broke straight after the Major's party. Her head was tied up with a white handkerchief, which made, in the dark,<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6184-00000063"/> a beautiful target for the Missouri shot guns, and the balls went whistling by her ears like a den of rattlesnakes. One passed through her hair, just grazing the skull; and over she tumbled, stunned for a few minutes. When she arose, she arose running. The Major's party were all gone. Her feet, as it were, by instinct, carried her to a neighbor's house, where she supposed Miss Cora was. She made no halt at the door, and burst it in with all her weight. Cora was fortunately in the room, and caught the frightened negro by the arms; her eyes like two moons of a gray night, rolled around the room; her mouth, white with ivory, was closed as tight as the grave.</p> 
               <p>"Speak! speak!" said Cora, shaking her violently-when she seemed to come a little to her senses, and said, "All killed! all killed! Missis-eb'ry nigger, and eb'ry ab'lisnist! I was the only one that got away, and I coch a bullet in my har! (clapping her hand on her head, and continuing,) Oh! oh! oh!"</p> 
               <p>"Killed! by whom?" demanded Cora, sternly.</p> 
               <p>"Don't know, Missis," said the negro, as she brightened up a little; "I spec it was <emph>Jeff Davis.</emph>"</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head> 
               <p>OAKHEAD and Bob Beabout, young and enthusiastic of Liberty, had been known as members of the Secesh party. Federal soldiers were entering Western Missouri. The writ of <foreign xml:lang="LAT">habeas corpus</foreign> had been suspended. Rumor's tongue had circulated the report that the Union soldiers were arresting every Secesh in the country. Hitherto, Oakhead and Bob Beabout had been quiet, and guilty of nothing save the sin of belonging to the so-called Secesh party. An ardent love of liberty, and a dread of trial by a military court, drove them to the bushes, and, finally, from the neighborhood of their own homes.</p> 
               <p>Union Missourians lost no time in informing the Federal soldiers that Oakhead and Bob Beabout were on the run-the natural consequence of which was to create the impression that they were desperate rebels. The consequences that followed these impressions may readily be imagined.</p> 
               <p>The Federal soldiers were instructed to shoot them wherever seen with arms in their hands. Being apprised of the situation of the times, Oakhead and Bob Beabout were constantly in the brush. They<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6184-00000064"/> would go in, occasionally, to some lone and solitary house, whose inmates were known to them to be of Southern origin, and ask for food, professing to be working their way to the Southern army.</p> 
               <p>An October sun was gilding the eastern hills. Mrs. -- was washing the faces of two little girls, whose father was far away on legitimate business. Rising up from her domestic task, she started back, as Oakhead and Bob Beabout stood before her.</p> 
               <p>"Fear not, madam," said Oakhead; "we are Southern men. We are striving to join our company, and are without food. A bit of breakfast, if you please, and we will leave."</p> 
               <p>The woman trembled as she informed them that she was alone, and that there were Federal soldiers in the neighborhood-requesting them to leave her house, for God's sake. It was of no use; the men were hungry.</p> 
               <p>"Give us some breakfast, madam; and get it as quick as you please. We have eaten nothing for twenty-four hours." And Oakhead set his gun down with an air that said he was not to be refused.</p> 
               <p>Pots, kettles, and cups rattled for half an hour, during which time Mrs. -- answered many questions concerning the Federal soldiers, said to be in the immediate vicinity. Breakfast was ready, and Mrs. --, with the caution of her sex, intimated that they could carry it to some retreat, and eat it at their leisure. Her house stood near the main road; "and soldiers may pass," she said, "before the day is old."</p> 
                
               <p>A smoking breakfast before a hungry man stimulates his bravery. Oakhead and Bob Beabout had just arisen from the table, when three soldiers came dashing down the road, at half speed-finely mounted, and armed with musket and saber. Quick as thought, Oakhead drew up his gun, and whispered to Bob, "They have found us. Let us sell our lives as dearly as possible."</p> 
               <p>By this time the foremost soldier was in front of the house. Oakhead took deliberate aim, and he tumbled from his horse. The frightened animal and the two remaining soldiers took the back track, at full speed; for, to them, it was a complete surprise, as no enemy was supposed to be at hand. They said that they were driven in by the pickets of a large force, and the camp was in great commotion.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. --, fearing the consequences of the sad affair, gathered up her children, and fled to a neighbor's house. Oakhead and Bob Beabout gathered up the musket and saber of the fallen man, and fled to the woods. The Rubicon was passed-the ice was broken-Oakhead was a bush whacker.</p> 
               <p>The sun was now shining upon all nature and the face of a dead man, lying in the road, whose blood had so lately stimulated him to fight for the Union. An old sow, that had tumbled the rocks in the branch for fourteen summers, came walking leisurely up the road, followed by a dozen half-grown pigs. When opposite the dead man, she hesitated; then, with cautious tread, approached his feet, and playfully shook the leg of his breeches. The shoats<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6184-00000065"/> stood in the background, with their bristles up. The old sow then ventured to the pale face of the dead man, and the teeth that had murdered a thousand snakes were sunk into his check: the pigs were soon drinking his blood; and Madame Rumor heralded the news through the State, that the hogs were eating Union men within three miles of the Federal camp.</p> 
               <p>It was evening: re-enforcements had arrived; the Federals advanced upon the house of Mrs. -- in two columns. No enemy was found. What remained of the poor, fallen soldier was interred; the house of Mrs. -- burned to the ground, and "Secesh" generally threatened.</p> 
               <p>Oakwood and Bob Beabout were now far away from the late scene, lurking in lonesome places, driven from home, with little hope of being soon permitted to return, and with no means of support. The musket and saber captured from their first victim was soon parted with for a few dollars, which enabled them to buy from those who would not give them bread. But that would soon be gone; and what then? Why, they must capture more. And how could so weak a party contend with even the picket guard of an army, which never consisted of less than five or six men? Only by lying in wait, under cover of some thick concealment, and taking them by surprise. Thus, they would conceal themselves by the roadside, and when a force sufficiently small would make their appearance, they were certain to be fired upon-generally with fatal effect. In this way they captured many arms and some horses, having gone thus far into the road of highwaymen; yet they would not interrupt a citizen, or take any thing except what they could get from the Federal army. Indeed, they thought themselves honest men, and were unable to see themselves in any other light.</p> 
               <p>Don Partlo, as we have seen, was a deserter from the Federal army. Burtice was not prepared to leave his home or any of his men at the time Don Partlo joined them in the attack upon Major Six; consequently, Don had to look out for himself. Burtice offered him concealment. "No," said he, "I will not hide." He had started South, to get out of the immediate neighborhood of the Federal army, where he hoped to encourage followers enough to defend himself. But he was in Federal uniform; as yet he had not taken time or had the means to change his garb. Dashing along the road like a dare-devil, on a fine charger, he entered a thick wood.</p> 
               <p>Oakhead said: "Bob, yonder come a fine horse and a brave-looking man; shall we take him off?"</p> 
               <p>"Egad! let's hold a parley with him," said Bob.</p> 
               <p>"You give him the 'halt!' and I will watch him close. If he shows any sign of fight, he is my meat," said Oakhead, as he cocked his piece and placed himself behind a tree.</p> 
               <p>"Halt!" said Bob Beabout, squaring himself in the road in front of Don Partlo.</p> 
               <p>"What will you have?" said our hero, coming to a stand.</p> 
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6184-00000066"/> 
               <p>"That horse!" said Bob.</p> 
               <p>"Light, or we will help you down," said Oakhead, now showing himself, with gun presented.</p> 
               <p>"Are you robbers, or Southern soldiers?" demanded Don Partlo, in a firm tone.</p> 
               <p>The word "robber" rang in the ears of the young men like a death-bell.</p> 
               <p>"We are no robbers; we are fighting the jayhawkers. They rob us, and we rob them; so that is the game. Do you understand?"</p> 
               <p>"We demand your horse," said Oakhead, in a firm voice.</p> 
               <p>"I am no jayhawker; I am fighting them myself," said Don Partlo.</p> 
               <p>"You wear the garb. That uniform tells more than you can tell with your tongue," said Oakhead, sternly.</p> 
               <p>"Do you know Burtice?" said Don Partlo.</p> 
               <p>"BURTICE!" Oakhead put his hand upon his forehead. "Do you know Burtice?" he continued.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! I know him," said Don, confidently.</p> 
               <p>"What in the h-ll are you doing in those buttons then?" said Oakhead, doubtingly.</p> 
               <p>"Go with me to Burtice, and I will satisfy you," said Don Partlo.</p> 
               <p>By this time guns were uncocked, and lengthy conversations ensued. Don Partlo was invited to join his fortunes with Oakhead and Bob Beabout.</p> 
               <p>"No," said he, "I intend to fight the enemy fairly; they shall never brand me with the appellation of <emph>Bushwhacker!</emph>"</p> 
                
               <p>Oakhead and Bob Beabout were led by Don Partlo into a bolder system of warfare.</p> 
               <p>When Major Six returned to his camp, on the night of the skirmish with Burtice, and found that Don Partlo had deserted, he swore vengeance against him; yes, "he would hunt him; he would have him, if he had to rake Dixie with a fine-tooth comb." When reflecting upon the cause of his desertion he was sorely puzzled in mind. At last an idea broke through his brain, bright as the eastern hemisphere before the rising moon. It was Cora. "Ah! I will attend to her; she is at the bottom of all this mischief. <emph>Traitorous woman!</emph>" melted on the tongue of Major Six, as he closed his eyes in slumber the next night after the retreat from the residence of Colonel S--.</p>

               <p>"AN order is given for six men to be ready in twenty minutes," said Loudfork to his messmates, as they hovered round the camp-fire in the vicinity of the town of --, in Western Missouri.</p> 
               <p>"What's up now? Damn this way of a private's never knowing any thing!" said Jack Jolly, pushing up the coals.</p> 
               <p>"Some one is to be arrested, and they say it is a <emph>woman,</emph>" said Loudfork, smiling.</p> 
               <p>"A WOMAN!-the h-ll you say!" and Jack Jolly stretched himself up six feet and four inches.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you know what a woman's tongue is; and folks must mind how they talk these times," said Loudfork, exultingly.</p> 
               <p>"Talk! h-ll and home-made thunder! I came to Missouri to fight, not to talk," said Jack, rashly.</p> 
               <p>"But you know there is policy in war, Jack," said Loudfork, looking at his watch.</p> 
               <p>"O! you need n't consult any time about it. If the Major wants any women arrested, I'll be d--d if he may n't do it himself. This boy wars men, not WOMEN. My mother was a woman. She didn't raise me to fight women. By h-ll, I had as soon fight an angel!" And Jack Jolly seated himself by a frying-pan, and commenced pulling out potatoes.</p> 
               <p>"Won't go, then?" said Loudfork, looking around on the faces of his comrades. He continued: "This is a military necessity; 't is a hard thing; but these war times it must be done. She will be well treated, only deprived of liberty for a military purpose. The Major will see to all of that. He commands; we execute. The duty of a soldier is to obey. Who will go? I want six men," said Loudfork.</p> 
               <p>Some whispering, some swearing, some laughing rang through the camp, for a few minutes. Then six men filed slowly away with Loudfork</p> 
               <p>Jack Jolly made no remarks. A dark shade hung upon his brow. Low and inaudible murmurs told only of his secret thoughts.</p> 
               <p>The boys said: "Jack is in love; he's thinking of his sweetheart at home. The Federal army never contained a braver man."</p> 
               <p>Colonel S-- was on the dodge. He was fearful of being arrested, as this seemed to be the day of retribution. Even if a Missourian had a grudge against his neighbor, he would try to have him arrested; and thus Federal commanders were often misled. Besides, the Colonel knew he had enemies in Kansas. He was, therefore, very cautious; had almost entirely abandoned his home. Thus we find Cora overburdened with cares, and almost constantly on the tramp, to see to her father's business. There<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6184-00000068"/> were several Union families in the neighborhood, with whom she counseled. She was friendly with every one.</p> 
               <p>The golden rays of an autumn sun mantled the vines that Cora's busy fingers had trained in early spring, around the windows of a dear and happy home. Through the dark, falling leaves of those vines, a Federal uniform met the eyes of Cora.</p> 
               <p>"O, my God!" she exclaimed, as the door opened, and an officer stood before her.</p> 
               <p>"You are my prisoner, madam," said Loudfork, sternly.</p> 
               <p>"Your prisoner!-I am no prisoner of yours yet, sir: stand! back!" said Cora, bravely.</p> 
               <p>Loudfork retreated to the hall, where he stood, with six others, in battle array.</p> 
               <p>Cora saw that resistance was useless. Every negro on the plantation would have fought to the death for her. By a wave of her hand she made them silent, as she said, with her eye gazing in the orbs of Loudfork:</p> 
               <p>"Gentlemen, if I am a prisoner, if I must appear at your camp, I will do so. If there is aught against me, I can answer it. I will go to your camp; but place not your hands upon me, at your risk. "Then, turning to a servant, Cora ordered her horse.</p> 
               <p>"Better let her have her own way," whispered Tom to Jerry.</p> 
               <p>It was not yet dark, when Loudfork and six privates rode up in front of Mr. --'s tavern, in the town of --, and demanded a private room for a lady.</p> 
               <p>"A guard will be placed at the outer door. No one is to see her except such of your servants as may be required to wait on her with food, etc. She is to have any thing in that line for which she calls, and charge Uncle Sam. Do you understand?" and Loudfork touched the rim of his cap, bowing to the landlord.</p> 
               <p>"The prisoner of Major Six shall lack for nothing in the way of comforts," said the landlord, as he turned to observe her enter the room. "Egad! pretty girl that," he whispered to Loudfork, as the door closed behind her.</p> 
               <p>Cora found herself alone, at twilight, in the room of a village tavern. The streets were full of soldiers. The low sounds of a distant cannon hummed in the poor girl's ear, like the dying notes of Gabriel's trumpet. Little did she think that this was imprisonment for imprisonment's sake. No; she thought she was accused, and would have a trial. She seated herself, and when thus composed, she tried to remember the past. She thought how ardently she had implored her father to keep him out of the Kansas troubles. She thought of all her idle talk with regard to secession; she thought of all she knew of her father's acts with the Secession party. She had never been on trial in a civil or any other court; but she knew the justice of all trial was predicated upon truth. With closed eyes and heaving breast, she mentally breathed the following prayer:<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6184-00000069"/>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head> 
               <p>IT was night, and the wind was still. Startled by a heavy crash, I said to a pale face that stood on the sidewalk of the county town, "What's that?"</p> 
               <p>"They have cut down the large pole that bore the Confederate flag. Union soldiers are expected here to-night, and 'Secesh' are fleeing. They have taken down the pole to save their enemies the trouble," said my informer, as he passed on.</p> 
               <p>The moon had commenced to silver the eastern hills. At the corner of the street sat two men, in earnest conversation. It was Jeff and Abe, Bear with me, kind reader, while I give you the substance of the interview.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. The right to own a slave is a political power; it is that alone that gives us the right to hold property of any kind. The government determines all these things: we can hold nothing without the consent of the government under which we live. If my government determines that its power shall not be extended to me over certain property, I must forego that right, if I remain loyal to my government. It<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6184-00000070"/> is not for individuals or communities to set up their peculiar notions of rights and wrongs in a government. If so, a man might claim a right to two wives, or claim children that are not his own, to the prejudice of others.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. O yes; it is a political right; but it is a State right, and not a national right, or a national wrong. It is a right under the common law of the State where it exists-a law known to all nations to rest upon the principle of having existed time out of mind. Thus, any principle in the organization of society, having existed time out of mind, is held to be a fixed law, and is the great arbiter in decisions in common law; and the common law can not be set aside without revolution. Slavery existed in the Southern States prior to the Constitution, which also guarantees it to them. They have, then, a double claim to it: that of the Constitution, and that of the common law, neither of which can be set aside without revolution. Suppose you conquer the Southern States, and free their slaves: must you not set aside State rights and the common-law principle, or the Southern people can again adopt the slave system?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. When any political power is made an element for national destruction, it is a national wrong, and the government has the right, in self-defense, to destroy it. Too many State rights would swallow all the rights of the nation. The government will not break the rights of a State first; but when the States attempt to break the rights of the National Government, what then? I would not break your head; but, if you attempted to break mine, have I not the right, in self-defense, to break yours to save my own? The laws of self-defense are recognized in every court, and in every land. If the States attempt to revolutionize the General Government, and get revolutionized themselves, who is to blame? The British Government, or the British forces, liberated slaves in the slave States, in the war of the Revolution, and in the war of 1812. In war, we must weaken the enemy by every means in our power, or we had better not go to war at all.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. The British Government paid to the United States a large sum of money for deported slaves, from the slave States, after the war of 1812. Do you expect to be less generous to your sister States, when the war is over, than was a foreign country?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. We must preserve the Union; we must have but one nation and one people to dwell upon this continent, and whatever sets up in opposition to it must be leveled down.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. The different States form the nation, and the preservation of the whole can never be effected by destruction of the parts. The amputation of an arm will not preserve the entire man. He may still live, but not the same; less powerful in war, less bold in attack; he is a cripple.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Ah! I would not break a State, or an arm of the body politic; I would only break a cursed political power that poisons the virtue of a State-that subtle gall that makes a daughter strike her mother.</p> 
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6184-00000071"/> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. What's gall to some is healing balm to others. But, for the argument, let's call it gall, and worthy of destruction. When you destroy it, it falls not alone, but with it falls the sacred rights of freemen; because the blow that kills this bitter gall kills State rights. Make one State out of thirty-four, and it becomes a monster too huge to live on any common food.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Big things can live as well as little ones, only they should be properly organized. All bodies are under the control of the head. In the language of the English poet, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"What if the foot, ordained the dust to tread,</l> 
                        <l>Or hand, to toil, aspired to be the head?"</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>The head must teach unruly members, and bear itself above the whole, or suffer dissolution.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. But if the head ordains the hand the dust to tread, or puts foot in pocket, woe betide the man.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. The head must know the general good, and look to all the parts; instruct the hand and caution give the foot, that, bearing down with pressing heel, no one shall suffer.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Our body politic is complicated. No one dissection serves the cause. It is a whole family, composed of equal frames, each one having arms and head. But for the common good they all have chosen a common head, to rule in certain things.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Then this common head is still the superior head, and must rule the rest, or all must go to pieces.</p> 
                
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Yes; must rule in foreign fields, direct the combined arm against a foreign foe, or against unruly heads who assume too much at home, but not when to destruction.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. But when this body is startled by domestic heads at home, and all set together to slay the common head of all, what then? when they press him to the wall, shall he strike in self-defense, or give up the ghost?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. A blow, even in self-defense, must be aimed with gracious care, lest, in killing those without, you slay all within.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. A blow to kill a certain pride, or clip a lock on a rebel head, that does not grow on those within, can scarce affect them.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. A lock, though gray, black, or brown, that grows on a rebel head in rightful law, when shorn by an unrelenting hand, will set up a precedent that shaves the heads of all.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. It is a grievous thing that such a lock should grow, that breeds dissension, engenders strife, makes such a family quarrel, gives no rest or peace at home, but always forebodes danger. Let's clip it, though death to all ensue.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Would you so tarnish the memory of your ancestors, for the slaves carried away by the British in the war of 1812? A majority of the commissioners at Ghent, who obtained the stipulation for indemnity, were Northern men-Adams, Russell, and Gallatin from the free, and Clay and Bayard from the slave States. If the slaves captured in this<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6184-00000072"/> war are to be paid for, God save the "greenbacks!" If not, God save the memory of Northern statesmen!</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. The Union must be, saved. All that hinder its salvation must be displaced. We have no other guarantee for liberty than the salvation of the Union. The government of our fathers is pressed to the very door of dissolution by traitors, North as well as South. In this crisis we must not stop to inquire a man's creed or his birthplace. If he is not for he is against the government-a patriot or a traitor. When the work is done-when the Union is saved-it will then be the duty of the government to rectify the wrongs that may have been inflicted, especially upon the loyal. Traitors must take the consequences. The government can scarcely interfere with the slaves of loyal men; at least, not without a recompense.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. The slaves of loyal men are like Tom Watson's deer: <q>

                        <l>A party went out to hunt, and camped</l>

                        <l>And with the rising of the morning sun,</l>

                        <l>And one I left on Little Fork, right at</l> 
                        <l>The Bailey Ford;" and Tom Watson sat down.</l>

                        <l>Passed the new-built church, and saw no deer,"</l> 
                        <l>Said Bill. "We, too, have come from Roebuck Ridge,</l> 
                        <l>Passed round the Potter's-field, and saw no deer,"</l> 
                        <l>Said Joe, "And we have come from Greenwood Swamp,</l> 
                        <l>Along the public road, and saw no deer,"</l> 
                        <l>Said Sam and G. Tom Watson looked sad,</l> 
                        <l>And rising up, he said: "I hunted down,</l> 
                        <l>The Little Fork; when near the Bailey Ford,</l> 
                        <l>A big buck bounced up. I leveled down</l> 
                        <l>My fowling piece and shot him through the head,</l> 
                        <l>And hung him on a sweet-gum-tree, right at</l> 
                        <l>The Bailey Ford." Just then, George Clifton came,</l> 
                        <l>And said: "I have hunted up and down</l>

                        <l>"Did you see Tom's deer?" said all at once.</l> 
                        <l>"No, I saw no game." Then Tom, laughing, said:</l>

               <p>MINGO is the appellation by which we call a child that was born of poor parents, in the State of Indiana, in the good old time of President Monroe's administration. At that time the country was new, and times hard upon the settlers. School-teachers were scarce, and schools, like angels' visits, few and far between. The parents of Mingo failed to educate him; but he grew up in those happy days of our country's prosperity, when the voice of the whole country applauded the government of our fathers, when the apple of discord was yet in the blossom. Mingo was taught in early boyhood that when he met an American, he met a fellow-citizen; whether he hailed from Maine or Georgia, Mingo shook him by the hand as his countryman.</p>

               <p>In the administration of Andrew Jackson, Mingo left his country and his home. Like his father, he took his ax upon his shoulder, and went in front of the tide of emigration West, and settled on the western border of Missouri. Uniting his fate and fortune with a Western girl, he, like many others, obtained a title to land by living upon it. Industry and frugality made him a quiet and peaceful home, at which he remained until the gold excitement of 1849-50. Fired by a desire for wealth, he determined to go to California. He became associated with Colonel S-- in that enterprise; made the trip, and got more experience than he did gold. He was ever after the firm friend of Colonel S-- and Burtice, though he took no interest in the settlement of Kansas; for he was now a prosperous farmer and father of a large family. His eldest son had left him, and was reported to be with the rebels. Some said that he was with Don Partlo; others that he was a bushwhacker. Mingo remained at home with his wife and seven little daughters. The shades of night covered his peaceful home. Five of his daughters, yet in the summer of childhood, were softly and sweetly sleeping; the two eldest, entering the spring of womanhood, were assisting their mother in the evening's work. Solitary and alone sat Mingo. The burning coal upon his hearth-stone glimmered in the glory of its element. Colonel S-- entered the room, when the following conversation ensued:</p> 
               <p>"I hope you are well, old friend," said the Colonel.</p> 
                
               <p>"Yes, I am in health of body, but not of mind. These are terrible times, Colonel," said Mingo, gravely.</p> 
               <p>"These are the times that try men's souls," rejoined the Colonel.</p> 
               <p>"I have determined to take no part in the matter from the beginning," said Mingo, seriously.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! my old friend, don't you recollect the fable of poor Tray-how he was unmercifully beaten, for no other cause than being found in bad company?" said the Colonel, sharply.</p> 
               <p>"I have endeavored not to be found in bad company, that is, what the Feds denominate bad company. You know, just between you and I, in confidence, I associate as much as possible with Union men, and I never talk my sentiments, except to some such person as you. I have been feeding the Doctor, over here, on soft corn, ever since this fuss began. You know he is a strong Union man, and very intimate with the Federal officers," said Mingo, earnestly.</p> 
               <p>"Actions speak louder than words,' is an old proverb; and, <emph>John,</emph> you know when they can't catch the cow, they sometimes take the calf; and when they can't catch the calf, may they not take the cow? My poor daughter is paying the penalty of a father's sin," said the Colonel, gravely.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! yes; I did all that I could to persuade John not to go. I told him that he should remember his old father, and his little sisters, and, for our sakes, he had better take no part in this unrighteous<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6184-00000076"/> quarrel. But John is hot-headed, and has gone. I could not stop him. I am honest in this: I have tried to keep the peace. I have done nothing with my own hands. I wish this thing was settled," said Mingo, sorrowfully.</p> 
               <p>"Our enemies are sharp in accusation. They say you must not give aid or comfort. You can not feed a rebel, or his horse, without giving aid and comfort. I know you have done that," said the Colonel, stoutly.</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, in the name of God, my own son, and my neighbor boys, that have been used to my house for so many years, to go and come as they please, could I turn them off? I have never turned off a Federal soldier, or a hungry man of any party. If they find fault with me for this, I can't help it. You know I have no learning, and I can't read all of those military orders and proclamations. I get the Doctor to read them for me; and I am trying to do right," said Mingo, earnestly.</p> 
               <p>"You intend to stand your ground, then," said the Colonel, slowly.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I will not run. I have never done any thing to run from. The Doctor says that they can not hurt me, under any rule of civilized warfare. The Doctor is a good Union man. He cautions me about the boys coming here. I asked him to tell the Federals to come, and I would treat them with much kindness," said Mingo, exultingly</p> 
               <p>"Beware of the Doctor; beware whom you trust these times. I could trust the government. I would not run from the head authorities of the United States; but those Kansas fellows, you know, have an old account to settle with us and think, with United States authority, they can pay up the old score. And, as Shakspeare says, I fear they will better the instruction.' I don't intend them to have a chance at me. True, they have destroyed my property; but, when they get me, they will have to pay for me. Now, tell me where John is?" said the Colonel, softening his voice.</p> 
               <p>"Before God! I don't know," said Mingo; and they parted.</p> 
               <p>"Turn the soldiers loose," said Loudfork, addressing Major Six, one cold November evening. "It is the only way we can stop this infernal bushwhacking;" and the jobbed the butt of his musket into the mud, as he repeated, "Turn the boys loose, and the bushwhackers will leave here faster than the contrabands go to Kansas."</p> 
               <p>A moderate person would think that the Major had turned himself loose long since. But that something might happen to frighten the bushwhackers, the Major said to Loudfork: "Cry havoc! and let slip the dogs of war."</p> 
               <p>'T was evening, and the ground was damp. Mingo had fed his stock, and seated himself quietly by his fireside, to take a smoke.</p> 
               <p>"La! pa, yonder come soldiers!" exclaimed one of his little girls, as she ran into the house, much frightened.</p> 
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6184-00000077"/> 
               <p>"Let them come, child," said Mingo, continuing to smoke his pipe, very unconcernedly.</p> 
               <p>"Do hide, my dear," said Martha, in a soft and tender voice. "They will not dare to hurt me and the children; but, I fear they will take you away, or harm you in some manner, on John's account." She smiled as she pointed out the secret retreat.</p> 
               <p>"No, let 'em come; I am not afraid of 'em," said Mingo, stoutly.</p> 
               <p>The conversation was suddenly closed, for the shadow of Loudfork soon darkened the door.</p> 
               <p>"Come in, gentlemen, and make yourselves at home," said Mingo, addressing himself, very politely, to "United States uniforms."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I guess we will make ourselves at home, for a short spell," said one of the soldiers.</p> 
               <p>"You are my prisoner," said Loudfork, tapping the old man on the shoulder.</p> 
               <p>"O! for God' sake," said Martha, clasping her hands; "You shan't."</p> 
               <p>"You shan't," said the eldest daughter, thrusting herself between Loudfork and her father.</p> 
               <p>"Stand aside, little one," said Loudfork, drawing his sword across the face of the affrighted girl.</p> 
               <p>"Be quiet, my children; they will not hurt me," said Mingo.</p> 
               <p>"No, we will only take you to <emph>head-quarters,</emph>" said one of the soldiers.</p> 
               <p>Mingo was now conducted to the front yard, and made give information of all his stock of cattle and horses. Several soldiers remained in the house.</p> 
                
               <p>"What have you hid here?" Said one of the soldiers to Martha, as he opened a closet-door.</p> 
               <p>"Nothing but some tow," said Martha, in anguish.</p> 
               <p>"I vill vetch out the devil," said a deluded Dutchman, as he threw a shovelful of burning coals into the closet.</p> 
               <p>"O! my God!" said Martha, as the pile of tow blazed up. Seeing no effort made to stop the fire by any of them, Martha said to them, stoutly: "Men, do you intend to burn us up?"</p> 
               <p>"No, ve vill burn your house, and leave you for the devil to burn," said the Dutchman.</p> 
               <p>The fire was now fast spreading over the room. Martha and her children seized a portion of the furniture and ran into the back yard with it. When the house was in full blast, some of the soldiers threw the furniture back into the flames. The remaining soldiers had, by this time, Collected the stock, both horses and cattle, every hoof on the place, and were preparing to start.</p> 
               <p>Having mounted Mingo on his finest horse, Martha now went to Loudfork, and said, imploringly:</p> 
               <p>"I hope you will not take my husband far away, or keep him long, as you see my situation, with all these little children in the cold."</p> 
               <p>"Dare is a fire; go and warm them," said the Dutchman, as he pointed to the burning house.</p> 
               <p>Martha now gave way to tears, and prayed to God for her children.</p> 
               <p>The soldiers, with Mingo and his stock, slowly wound over the hill, and were soon lost to view.<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6184-00000078"/>

               <p>"Mother, I had rather freeze than go to that house; you know they have not treated us right," said Mingo's eldest daughter to her mother, when the soldiers were all gone.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my child; but these little ones: what can we do with them?" said Martha, mournfully.</p> 
               <p>It was now dark, and Martha and her children still lingered around the burning wreck.</p> 
               <p>"The Doctor is an old hypocrite," said one of the girls.</p> 
               <p>"Mother, I do n't want to go to sleep," said one of the little ones.</p> 
               <p>Martha looked wistfully toward the Doctor's house, and still they lingered around the embers of a once happy home.</p> 
               <p>The morning star silvered the old straw-shed-the little ones were closely nestled in the straw. Martha and the two eldest girls sat over them, and talked and cried. The gray light of the morning came; but the little ones were buried from their late fright: the innocent balm of sleep held them from the troubled world.</p> 
               <p>"O mother! do not waken them," said one of the girls, softly.</p> 
               <p>"Hush! yonder comes the Doctor; probably he has some news," said Martha, starting up.</p> 
               <p>"Good morning, madam; you seem quite desolate," said the Doctor, coldly.</p> 
               <p>Martha wept aloud.</p> 
               <p>"The old man lies just over the hill, madam. I am compelled to be in town, on military business, in half an hour." And the Doctor put the spurs to his horse.</p> 
               <p>Nimble feet sped o'er the ground for a few minutes. "O mother! he is dead," said one of the little ones.</p> 
               <p>"There is no other chance, mother: the men are all gone. There are none this side of town," said the eldest daughter.</p> 
               <p>"If his hand was just loose from that bush," said Martha, as she wept aloud.</p> 
               <p>Mingo had been shot through the lungs: he lay on his back; his left hand rested upon his breast; his right held a small shrub with the grasp of death. The girls were resolute and determined; Martha assisted a little, and they carried the body of Mingo to the Doctor's house.</p>

               <p>"HAVE you heard the news?" said Little Ben to the editor of the <title>Platte Country Post.</title> Then, as he dug a hole in the ground with his toe, continued: "Mingo has been killed in cold blood; his house and others burned to the ground, and the devil let loose generally."</p> 
               <p>The editor shook his head, and seemed to say mentally, in the language of Solomon, "There is a time to be merry, and a time to be sad; a time to rejoice, and a time to weep; a time to be awake, and a time to sleep; a time to be silent, and a time to speak."</p> 
               <p>"Very many reports, my son," said the editor, as he passed on.</p> 
               <p>"Halloo, Ben! have you engaged papers for tomorrow?" said a comrade, coming up.</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"How many?"</p> 
               <p>"Same old number."</p> 
               <p>"Why do n't you go it strong? To-morrow is a big day."</p> 
                
               <p>"Don't care; can't sell many papers."</p> 
               <p>"O! you do n't try hard."</p> 
               <p>"No use. These editors put me in mind of Joe Slater hunting old Barns's oxen."</p> 
               <p>"How so?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, old Barns sent Joe into the woods to hunt a pair of his oxen, and Joe staid a long time; and when he came, old Barns said, 'Did you find the oxen, Joe?' When Joe cleared his throat, he said, 'I found one of them, sir, and drove him up, and put him into the pasture.' 'Well, Joe,' said Barns, 'did you see or hear any thing of the other one?' 'Yes, sir; I found him, too, and drove them both up together, and put them into the pasture.' So, these editors, when they hear any news, tell part of it today, and part to-morrow; and sometimes they do n't tell the other part at all. And when you offer to sell a paper to a man, he looks at you just like he thought you were going to swindle him out of five cents."</p> 
               <p>"Ben, I do n't believe you are Union."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I am as good a Union as any boy in St. Jude."</p> 
               <p>"Full-blooded?"</p> 
               <p>"No; I'm a half-breed; I thought you knew, Mother is a Secesh."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha! I thought there was a blue streak about you."</p> 
               <p>"Blue streak or black streak, I want to sell some papers. I'm going to have a new pair of shoes agin Christmas, if I have to steal 'em."</p> 
               <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6184-00000080"/> 
               <p>"Hush! I believe the cars are coming."</p> 
               <p>And they sped to the depot.</p> 
               <p>"Jist hand me the reins, and I will drive to that county sate in three hours," said an Irish coachman, as the military authorities were disputing over the proper escort to accompany the United States mail.</p> 
               <p>The Blue was crossed; the coach rolled slowly down a long hill into a dense forest, followed by a dozen United States uniforms. "Holy Jasus!" said the Irishman, as a long file of armed men entered the road before him.</p> 
               <p>"Throw down your arms, or you are dead men!" said Don Partlo, in a shrill and piercing tone.</p> 
               <p>The Federal soldiers obeyed, for they were out numbered two to one.</p> 
               <p>Under a thick cover of brush Don Partlo ripped open the mail-bags. In casting his eye over a bundle of letters, one drew his special attention. He said mentally, "I have seen that P made before, in other places, and under other circumstances." He had seen it made in the sand, many years ago, in Kansas, by little Cora. It was as familiar to him as the lover of heaven. The letter was quickly torn open, and proved to be from Cora to her father's friend, Preston, in the East. It gave a short statement of her situation, and requested his assistance with head authorities, for her release. Cora had managed to slip the letter out of her prison by the hand of one of her attendants.</p> 
                
               <p>"Ah!" said Don Partlo, "it will take Preston three days to get a shirt ironed, to attend to any such business as that. I know Aunt Polly too well on that head. <emph>By heaven!</emph> I will <emph>liberate</emph> her! I will give them no such trouble, no such gratification. Give me forty men and a dark night, and I will <emph>liberate</emph> her."</p> 
               <p>And Don Partlo looked sadly upon half that number. Then he refolded the letter, directed it as before, and laid it gently in the mail. When he had taken every thing from the mail that suited him, he bade the coachman onward to his destination, paroled the escort, and departed.</p>

               <p>GENIUS is an aged man, with venerable aspect and silver beard. Unlike the heathen gods, he rules no particular element, but lends a helping hand to all. The poet, author, architect, teacher, navigator, statesman, orator, theologian, general in the field, and all the others, even in the simplest avocations of life, may consult him to advantage. He lives not in a sealed house-he dwells in the open air; he is not found in high places, neither in the schools. <q>

               <p>Thus contemplating, my attention was again called to another conversation between Jeff and Abe. I was substantially as follows:</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. I was on the Oliver plantation, in the Mississippi Valley, in the winter of 1836. I heard it announced that at Christmas there would be some negro weddings. I was somewhat curious to witness the ceremonies, having never seen a negro wedding. Old Oliver had sent to Virginia, that fall, and purchased chased twenty young negroes; ten men and ten women. He told me that he always purchased an equal number of men and women, so each man on the plantation could have a wife, which I thought a very good consideration, but wondered if he ever thought how little choice he gave the poor creatures. But enough of that. There were to be ten weddings on Christmas eve. So I was dying of curiosity to see the ball come off. At the appointed time I repaired to old Oliver's house, where the ceremony was to be performed, the negro quarters being close by. I was sitting in conversation with old Oliver, during which time he informed me that, some four weeks since, twenty young negroes had been brought to the plantation; that he had given them until that night to make their choice among themselves of husband and wife; that he would marry them all in a few minutes, and then they would have a dance. Old Oliver had just concluded his story when a large company of negroes appeared before the door. I sat in amazement. The negroes were all still as death. Old Oliver raised up a little, but still reclined on his sofa. Two young negroes stepped out into the center of the room. Old Oliver said the ceremony, taken in part from the Bible, which I have forgotten; but it was short. They retreated, and two more came up to the altar, and so on until nine couple were united in the solemn bonds of wedlock. There was then a pause. Old Oliver straightened up, and fixing his eye upon a tall negro that stood by the door-side, addressed him as follows:</p> 
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6184-00000082"/> 
               <p>"Well, Joe, you and Jane are the last. Both d--d ugly-beauty is only skin deep any way-why do n't you come along?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, Massa," said Joe, "Jane don't want me, and, 'fore God, I do n't want her."</p> 
               <p>"The h-ll you say," continued old Oliver, in an angry tone; then softening his voice, the said, "My money is all spent; I can buy no more negroes this year. I can not afford to give you separate houses; you will have to bundle together; so you had as well come along."</p> 
               <p>Joe intimated that they could tenant the same house and not be married. Old Oliver shook his head, and I had some doubts myself, though I pitied the poor creatures from the bottom of my heart.</p> 
               <p>Old Oliver straightened himself up and said: "I will not permit such foolishness; come along."</p> 
               <p>Joe and Jane slowly assumed their position, and stood, as a monument of the abuse of the slave power.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Money is the root of all evil, said a wise man. Hard cases must and will appear in all ages and among all nations. I often think of Susan Seldom. Bright and beautiful girl! She lived in a Northern village, though the same may happen anywhere. Susan was an only daughter. Her parents had been in good circumstances, but hard-favored fortune had reduced them to a low estate, and a mortgage was hanging over old Seldom's house. The court was at hand, and, without some remedy, the whole family must be turned out upon the cold charities of the world. A wealthy old bachelor fancied Susan. He saw his advantage, and proffered the assistance, but on one condition. Susan detested him. The old people thought it was a childish whim; he had money and was respectable; he had experience and a sober head to guide her in her wayward fancies. 'T was Sunday, and the sun was down. The shades of night were gathering in the corners of old Seldom's parlor. A few books lay scattered over the floor. The old man sat in the center of the room with a melancholy look; by his side sat his helpmate, faithful and true, for five-and-twenty years. In front of them Susan had fallen on her knees; her eyes were flooded with water, and her lips uttered: "O father, I can't!" Old Seldom walked the floor, and Susan buried her face in her mother's lap. Old Seldom passed out of the door, and his wife said: "Poor man! he will never stand this shock." A new idea entered Susan's brain-it was suicide. She saw, in her imagination, her father hanging to a beam. With a wild, hysteric laugh she bounded out of the door and called her father. The wedding-day was set, Susan and the old bachelor were married by a minister of the Gospel, and not as old Oliver married his negroes.

                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Many years ago, in the proud State of Kentucky, I attended church, on a beautiful sunny Sunday, in the golden month of October. It was a meeting of the Baptist persuasion, and a glorious, warm meeting. An elder of deserved reputation had delivered a glowing and eloquent sermon; then came the shaking of hands among the church members. Captain Riverman, and old acquaintance of mine, and a leader in the church, shook my hand with a glowing warmness that seemed to say that he was in love, with all mankind. The meeting was over, and I had an invitation to go with the Captain and his family to dinner. As I dismounted my horse, the Captain and his lady drove up to the yard fence in a fine carriage. We all passed through the front yard and approached his residence at the back door. A negro boy, some fourteen years of age, was seated on the door-step. Both of his arms and one of his legs were fastened together with a large chain, made for drawing logs with oxen. His countenance was cast down, and sadness had settled deep in his heart. I hesitated. The Captain warmly invited me in, and then explained that he intended to send the boy to Arkansas, to a cotton plantation in which he had an interest, and the rascal, finding out his intention, had run off and given him some trouble, and was only chained for the present, until the party was ready to start-and the Captain continued the conversation-that he would be better off, but the rascal did not want to leave his mother, and she could not be spared from his Kentucky farm. I had by this time, lost all faith in the Captain's religion, but passed off the evening as best I could, and departed. My last look at the Captain's beautiful residence was clouded with a black man in darkness and in chains. How sad the reflection.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. If I understand the Scriptures, all men are under condemnation from the fall of Adam. Prior to the Christian Era, sacrifices were offered to the living God; but since the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the way has been opened, and a plan set up whereby all men may be saved. Having premised thus far, we venture to affirm that the coming, the death, and resurrection of Christ was to remove the original sin; and, in this sense, we propose to look at the negro; and, as an antediluvian, I affirm I that he is not a man at all, of which we have any account. But if you say the posterity of Adam were preserved in the ark with Noah, then I answer, true; Noah preserved three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, together with the fowls of the air, and all cattle and creeping things upon the whole face of the earth.</p> 
               <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6184-00000084"/> 
               <p>Now, Shem had five sons, Japheth had seven, and Ham had four sons.</p> 
               <p>When the waters were assuaged, and the land was dry, Noah and his sons went out from the ark; and Noah planted a vineyard, and built a wine-press, and drank of the wine, and was drunken. And Ham regarded not his drunkenness. And Noah awaketh from his wine, and said, "Cursed be Canaan. A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren." First: Why should Noah curse Canaan, who was innocent of Ham's offense, at least as much so as Cush, or any one of the others of Ham's sons? Second: If that curse turned Canaan black, at the time, why was it not mentioned? And, third, why should Canaan be a servant to Ham's other children? It appears that the curse was put upon Canaan, the fourth son of Ham-or, as I take it, the adopted son of Ham-for it is said that Ham was the father of Canaan. It is nowhere said that Ham is the father of his other children. The word <emph>father,</emph> in the sense used here, means protector. The practice of adopting children is very ancient. <emph>Josephus,</emph> the historian of the Jews, says, in his "Antiquities of the Jews," Book first, chapter 7, page 31, "Now Abram, having no son of his own, adopted Lot, his brother Haran's son." But if you say that Canaan could have no other father-that all mankind, save Noah and his sons, were drowned in the flood-then I answer, the same historians, both sacred and profane, who give us an account of the flood, give us the account, also, of another family, diverse to that of Noah, whom they denominate <emph>giants.</emph> If there was one, why not two? All tribes of the negro have descended from the Canaanites, and to claim that they are men, equally endowed with the Fathers of the Church, is preposterous. The great Teacher said, "Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature." This does not mean that you should preach the Gospel to your horse; yet, your horse is a creature. If you reproach me for calling the negro an animal, then, I answer, the proudest emperor that ever graced the throne of an empire, is an animal; at least, he has an animal body and animal propensities; but, I admit, an immortal soul. No reasonable man will contend that an infant is accountable for the sin of Adam, or deny that an infant has an immortal soul. If I deny that Christ died for the negro, I do not deny that the negro has a soul. This I leave to the Judge of all the earth. Neither would I deny to the negro the moral precepts of the Christian religion.</p> 
               <p>I will now answer the question "Why should Noah curse Canaan?" Because Canaan was not his natural, but his adopted son; and Noah plainly saw that he was fit for nothing but a servant. Is there any other reason? Canaan was not the eldest or most intelligent son of Ham; that honor is given to Cush, the father of Nimrod. Then I repeat the question, Why curse Canaan, and subject his posterity to servitude for all time to come? and for<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6184-00000085"/> what reason? Because his father laughed at Noah's drunkenness; an offense most trivial, according to the moralist of the present day; yet that curse turned his skin black, put short wool on his head, and clouded his intellect. If we are to believe that Canaan was the real son of Noah, the curse would have been a miracle, equal to the creation of a man; it is not mentioned in the history of the Patriarchs, so far as regards any change of Canaan's person, and I take it for granted there was no such change. But if you say I have not shown sufficient reasons that Ham is not the sire of Canaan, and still contend that the negro is a descendant of Noah, then, I answer, the curse of Noah entirely changed his organization, and he ceased to be the equal of Noah's other children. He always has been, and ever will be, their servant-a minor, irresponsible both to God and man, in any other capacity than that of a servant. The angel of the Lord appeared unto Abraham, and showed him the seed of the promise could not descend through Ishmael, the son of Hagar, the bondwoman; and sacrifices were offered by the Patriarchs without spot or blemish. The Universalist would save all men. All other denominations would save their respective orders. But the <emph>great Teacher</emph> said: "My kingdom is not of this world." The wild colt of an ass bore him with gentleness, and the waves of the sea were stilled by his voice. And he has said, "Servants, obey your masters."</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Your reasoning puts me in mind of an old Indian tradition that I heard far up the Missouri River, many years since. It is as follows:</p> 
               <p>"The Great Spirit having formed the water and the land, the fowls of the air, the fishes of the sea, and all animals and creeping things, was mindful that he had not made a man to dwell on the face of the earth. And out of the dust of the earth he made the first man, and laid him in the sun to dry. And when he was fully dry, his color was black, and he loved to dwell in tropical climes, and bask in the sun. This is the negro. And the Great Spirit was not satisfied with him. And out of the dust of the earth he made the second man, and laid him in the shade to dry. And when he was fully dry, his color was red, and he loved to sit in the shade, and roam through the woodland. This is the Indian. And the Great Spirit was still dissatisfied; and out of the dust of the earth he made the third man, and covered all his outer parts with fig-leaves, and laid him in the shade to dry. And when he was fully dry, his color was white. And when the Great Spirit called him, he had made him a garment of fig-leaves. And the Great Spirit told him to go and till the ground. And he made war on the Indian, and took the negro for his lackey-boy. This is the white man."</p> 
               <p>We are taught by the Holy Scriptures that we are all the descendants of Adam, And out of Ishmael, the son of the bondwoman, the Lord Promised Abraham to make a nation. The Scriptures abundantly teach us that Christ suffered for all men,<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6184-00000086"/> and one of his immediate followers, even one of the twelve Apostles, was a Canaanite. Your doctrine bars the negro from the Church. Your idea of his origin is new. How do you account for the origin of the Indian, and other barbarous people?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. The Lord promised Abraham to make a nation of Ishmael; but, at the same time, it is clear that the seed of the promise could not descend through Ishmael: not because he lacked nationality-not because he was not the son of Abraham-but because he was the son of Hagar, the bondwoman. Had Hagar committed any offense? The birth of Ishmael was approved by Sarai, Abraham's white wife,<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="WRIGHT2-0653-NOTE004" n="*"

                  </note> who thought herself barren. But the angel of the Lord wrought a miracle, that the seed of promise might descend without spot or blemish. As to one of the twelve Apostles being a Canaanite, he who spake as never man spake, said: "Twelve have I chosen, and one is a devil." Among the twelve Apostles there were two Simons, distinguished by St. Matthew and St. Mark as Simon Peter, and Simon the Canaanite. St. Luke distinguished the latter by the appellation of Simon the Zelotes, and, according to St. John the Evangelist, he was the father of Judas Iscariot. See John, vi: 71; xii: 4, 5, 6; xiii: 2, 26. Now, it is clear that John alludes to Simon the Canaanite, for he speaks of Simon Peter in drivers other places, and always calls him Simon Peter, or Peter. As to Simon, the father of Judas Iscariot, being a Canaanite, many generations had passed away since the Jews drove the Canaanites out of the land; and although the great body of the Canaanites had been slain or driven out, some remained, and adopted the Jewish customs and religion. When Joshua took Jericho, Rahab turned traitor to her people, and was saved alive, and lived with the Jews. See the book of Joshua, chap, ii and xi: 24, 25. The Gibeonites were also made hewers of wood and drawers of water, and remained among the Israelites. See Joshua, chap. ix. Simon had probably retained the name of the Canaanite, with very little of the blood; it appears, however, there was enough to brand him with the name of thief, and the carrier of the bag. As to the origin of the Indian, and other barbarous people, Solomon said: "Train up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." The organization of the human mind is such that the continued neglect of the moral faculties, from generation to generation, suffers them to sink into obscurity; other passions increase, and the features are changed; the knowledge of the living God is lost, and the man is a fit subject for another flood. Jesus has testified that some are past redemption, and says: "Let such be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican." See Matthew, chap. xviii: 15, 16, 17.</p>

When St. Paul was sent to Rome, he was shipwrecked on the island of Melita, and the barbarous people showed him no little kindness; they kindled a fire to shield him from the cold and the rain, and the healed their sick. But if he ever opened his mouth to preach to them the Gospel, it is not recorded. But when he was arraigned before Agrippa, his eloquence moved the stony heart of the unbeliever.</p>

               <p>CORA opened her eyes to the light of another day. Three mortal weeks she had been confined in the town of --, seeing no one but her attendants, two or three of the servants of her landlord. In vain she had looked for a day of trial-in vain she had endeavored to ascertain for what she was imprisoned. The golden rays of an October sun danced against her window, as she looked out upon the broad and beautiful prairies. Something seemed to whisper her that a crisis was at hand. She thought over all her past life; she thought of her father, of the destruction of his property, and of the imminent danger of his life; she thought of Don Partlo; of her early and first acquaintance with him; of his present deportment; of his desperate daring,<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6184-00000088"/> and the dangers that surrounded him; she thought of her mother's grave, and the blood seemed to hurry through her veins, and the muscles of her frame became like iron; she looked out of the window, and thought of throwing herself headlong to the ground from her prison, which was an upper room, when something seemed to whisper in her ear-"No; I will have revenge!"</p> 
               <p>The day had passed almost away. A dark cloud that had hovered in the west was drawing its mantle over the ill-fated town of -- and Cora drew a tattered curtain over her window, to still the sound of the pattering rain. The door of her room turned gently upon its hinges, and, for the first time since her flight with Burtice from Kansas, she beheld the face of her Kansas father. Major Six drew close around him a blue frock-coat, heavily mounted with brass buttons. Cora rose to her feet, and stood like a culprit.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! little one, you escaped from me once, but I have you now," said the Major, forcing a smile.</p> 
               <p>"So it seems," Cora replied, sadly.</p> 
               <p>"You are getting a little tired by this time," continued the Major.</p> 
               <p>"I have been ready to answer any charge against me since here I have been," said Cora, firmly.</p> 
               <p>"Madam, you can be released upon but one condition," said the Major.</p> 
               <p>"Name it," said Cora, stoutly.</p> 
               <p>"If you will place your hand upon the Bible, and swear, before high heaven, that you will assist in the capture of Don Partlo, then you can go free." And the Major stood very square before her, with his finger pointed at her face.</p> 
               <p>"Is there no other way?" said Cora, in a measured tone.</p> 
               <p>"None!" said the Major, stoutly.</p> 
               <p>"Then I will rot in prison," said Cora, firmly.</p> 
               <p>"That will not be permitted, either," said the Major, reddening up.</p> 
               <p>"You make me assist you! No; never! <emph>never!</emph> NEVER!" And Cora dwelt upon the <emph>never</emph> with an emphasis that seemed spoken by the heart instead of the lips.</p> 
               <p>"You can have your choice of two things," said the Major, pulling out a brace of pistols.</p> 
               <p>"Give me one, sir! I dare you," said Cora, pressing forward.</p> 
               <p>"No," said the Major; "you must comply, or make up your last account." And he drew back the hammer of the weapon, thinking to frighten the poor girl.</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Shoot, coward, a defenseless woman!</emph>" said Cora, as she bared her bosom, looking steadily in the eyes of the Major.</p> 
               <p>The Major's hand trembled, his nerves gave way, his knees shook, and the pistol fell to the floor, discharged by the shock of the fall. At the report, several persons rushed into the room. The Major stood as white as a gravestone; Cora rushed toward the door.</p> 
               <p>"Stand back!" said the guard, lowering the bayonet<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6184-00000089"/> onet on his musket. A strong arm grasped the barrel of the musket and shoved it aside, as Cora fled through the door, like a bird out of a cage. It was the arm of Jack Jolly.</p> 
               <p>When Cora gained the street, she went a south course, at full speed.</p> 
               <p>"Shoot! Shoot her!" was heard from several quarters. A Dutchman raised his gun, and a lieutenant struck him on the forehead with the back of his sword. Cora gained the woods, and was soon out of the reach of a musket-ball.</p> 
               <p>By this time the Major had recovered, and explained how the pistol was fired, the bravery of the girl, and his own lack of nerve-over which the whole camp had a hearty laugh.</p>

For what offense I am thus held, for I have been here over two weeks, God only knows. I am ready to meet any charge that may be brought against me, but none appears.

I am run to death to look after Bridget and the balance of the low trash that you have about the house; and it's always pay, pay,<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6184-00000092"/> pay, and nothing done right, Preston. It seems to me that you have a knack of getting the meanest, lowlifest, triflingest servants that's going in the country; and it's always pay, pay, pay, and little do they know how to spend money when they get it-and money ought to be saved these times.

               <p>"PEACE and Plenty breed cowards. Plenty is the mother, and in her generous womb-a fountain full of new-made eggs-wooes the spreading wing of peace. Chickens from this dung-hill stock will strut and crow, and scratch the ground, and when vermin creep the yard, sneak off to roost. And few we have of any other breed. A generous mother, with the fountains of her breast, has made her children pets, that hug, with selfish squeeze, a little raked-up trash.</p> 
               <p>"Upon my soul, if I could raise a hundred men that would not tremble when the thunders roll, or turn aside from white-faced Death, who place on life a value less than wind, that is not the life of freemen-men of such a compass and a soul, like Richard on the battle-field, would give a kingdom for a horse-I would march upon the Federal camp, throw down the battlements and walls of all their bravery, like Joshua did, with old ram's horns, the walls of Jerico.</p> 
               <p>"Bravery, like Julius Csar's brow, frowns on<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6184-00000093"/> pale faced Fear, and lives a moment, as it would a thousand years.</p> 
               <p>"Hark! is that the sound of horses' feet?" and Don Partlo laid his ear unto the ground, and caught the coming sound of troopers. Then, hastening to his camp, he said, "Brave men, the foe is right upon us, in numbers ten to one! But stay your blood: let not the bounding veins convey it unto your heads, to muddy up your sight and spring your nerves. Think not of home, of friends, the future, or the past; think not" of hearts entwined in yours, or, lingering back within a citadel, in shape of Eden's queen, and, with the lazy wheels of time, beat a pulse high in hope for you; nor the blue eyes they cast on you; nor the, soft voice that said good-bye, but of your guns. See that they are right. Equipped and harnessed with your accouterments, follow me unto the crest of yonder hill; there we will make a stand, as far apart as ground allows, and fire when I wave my hand. Repeat, without an order, until all of us have fallen."</p> 
               <p>Then, down a sloping hill, a hundred men, all mounted and uniformed in coats of blue, came dashing forward, marking time; and up the next ascent they rose in double file, until within a short stone's cast of its mortal crest. Don Partlo waved his hand. Bang, bang, bang! the smoke flew up in thickening cloud, and leaden balls went whistling through the ranks, without respect of heads. The scanning of two hundred eyes could see no man. Again, again, the smoke went up. Blue-coats measured on the ground the length of uniforms. 'T was more than flesh and blood could stand. The Federals fly: <q>

               </p> 
               <p>Reinforced, and strong with foot and horse, again they reach the hill, surround it with their spreading files, search it up and down, and find nothing save their own dead men, marred by traitors.</p> 
               <p>Don Partlo, with his thirteen men, have crossed a hundred hills, and snugly, in some lone retreat, are telling tales of love, of honor, or some old woman's visions of witchcraft. Still, in this rebellious State, a macaroon is found boisterous in the rebel camp, cursing <emph>Uncle Sam:</emph> then, in the Federal camp, with greasy tongue, as loyal as the best.</p> 
               <p>By this means, Don Partlo is found, far from any public way, encamped within a hewn-log house, and with sixty men, or more, surrounded at the break of day, whose captain shouted, in thunder tones, "Surrender up yourselves?"</p> 
               <p>Don Partlo said unto his men: "'T is but Death, a necessary end of this eventful life, that, soon or late, must come to every man; and in him there is no<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6184-00000094"/> dissembling. He never takes the breadth of a hair not his own. In him there is nothing bad; but the manner of his coming is sometimes most horrible. These long and trusty guns, that we have held as sure and steadfast friends, have, by the dint of circumstance, become relentless foes; and, in the front of this log-house, right on the bare ground, of them we make a funeral pile. See! each man has, in each coat-sleeve, a Colt's revolver, carried close concealed; and when I clear my throat, let's slip to yonder friendly wood, firing, as we go, right and left; and if we chance to meet with honest Death, he comes in such a friendly way that leaves the little we have left a name without a spot of tarnish."</p> 
               <p>The Federals saw the guns laid down, and thought the rebels vanquished. In humble gait, and with down look, the rebels walked right up to their broad circling foe. Don Partlo cleared his throat, and then it thundered. Great clouds of smoke encircled rebel heads. No Federal ball did take effect upon the retreating brave. This friendly wood had soon concealed the last escaping traitor. Then curses from the Federal ranks, loud and long, were hurled on the time most graciously given for this surrender.</p> 
               <p>When Don Partlo and his thirteen men had gained a safe retreat, and all were gathering up around the daring <emph>leader,</emph> he stood as pale as Death's old horse, and trembled like an aspen leaf.</p> 
               <p>"What on earth dost thus affright you?" said all of them at once.</p> 
               <p>"When we were in the house, and bayonets stood as thick as hemp, nay, when we came forth and cut our way through that fearful crowd, when bullets whistled on every side, I felt no fear. But when we had gained the friendly woods, the din and sound of mortal strife had died upon my ears. All at once, and like a flash of lightning from the clouds, my last night's dream did glimmer through my brain, and it has almost vanquished me."</p> 
               <p>"The dream! the dream!" demanded all of them at once.</p> 
               <p>"I slumbered heavy in the latter end of night, and had this woeful dream, out of which the noise of attack awakened me; and, by some strange logic of the brain, it was concealed until we were out of danger.</p> 
               <p>"I dreamed that the Federals came, as they have done; surrounded us on every side, demanding base surrender; that we fought them, as we have, and made our victory good. But, a little after that, a lovely maid, more dear to me than all the world, a prisoner now in Federal hands, had made a safe and sure escape; and, by directions from a friend, was coming to this same log-house, to blend her fate with ours, who arrived but just in time to be recaptured by the foe.</p> 
               <p>"Dreams are but eddies in the current of the mind; cut off from record's gentle stream, playing strange, fantastic tricks. I have dreamed of hideous, bloody heads; faces awry and wan have danced before my brain; have dreamed of vermin and d--n dens of fleas; cold-blooded snakes have crawled<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6184-00000095"/> upon my flesh; I have tumbled headlong down from high and rocky cliffs; nay, have dreamed of death, the mattock, and the grave; the worms that eat through dead men's flesh have crawled upon my skin. And I have raised from all of them without a shade of fear; but this one doth affect me."</p> 
               <p>Don Partlo wept, and all of them, murmuring, said, "'T is strange to see the bravest man in all this world act the woman."</p>

               <p>"TRADITION is a hopeful thing, plain as the face of day, and bare of ornament; holds up the deeds of men, long after they are dead, to the gaze of all the world. 'T is by tradition that we do know the course of our fathers, who, long before we entered on this mortal stage, played their parts in this hopeful life. And lo! whose tracks are, left, "footprints on the sands of time," to guide us from the shallows and the shoals of all their crossings? But to follow in a beaten path, a road made smooth by him that went before, is bare of honor; and I had rather die a wanderer in fields of doubt, perish in the hills of time, or sink beneath the swamps of fortune, than fail to pluck from hard-handed fate a plume of honor.</p> 
               <p>"Hark! Some one comes to interrupt my meditations. Good morning, Jeff. With you I would like another conversation; for still I doubt your moral views of slavery, and now that we are all alone, let's have it.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Proceed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. You have pressed the doctrine earnestly that the slave is a "minor;" you call a hoary-headed colored man, leaning upon a staff, by the appellation of "boy!" Where is the break in nature that prevents a colored man from passing out of boyhood, or childhood, that can't be found in any other race of men? What I understand by the word "minor," is one under age, one not arrived to manhood. By the word "minor," as applied to other races, I would understand an Indian boy; a German boy, a heathen boy; and would not suppose you to mean an old Indian, an old German, or an old heathen; and how do you say that an old negro is a "minor?"</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. It is conceded among all nations that parents shall have the control of their offspring; and when they die, their children are their natural heirs. It is a law of nature that the father should conduct the son through his tender years. Through this minority the son is responsible to the father, and the father to his country. In nature, child-hood passes away by the slow process of growth and development. In law, it passes away at the twinkling of an eye, as sudden as the break of day. Our Constitution has determined the time that all heirs of the government shall be men: at twenty-one years of age, heirs of the government are men and citizens. Negroes and Indians are not heirs of the government, and are forever minors to our government.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. I know the Constitution excludes Indians. If it excludes negroes, I have never been able to find the passage. The word "minor" is not in our Constitution. I know that the qualified electors are determined by every State; and, in some of the states, the negro is held as a "minor." By what rule is he, in no circumstances, an heir to the government? If he is a thief, the government punishes him-if a murderer, does he not hang? If he resembles you in this, why not in other things? A boy that has lost his father and his mother-nay, all his kindred-and does not heir a dollar in the world, is the heir of his government. It is his inheritance, his birthright-he is one of the sons of his native land. And what better claim can one have than his birthright? One born in France is a Frenchman; born in England, is an Englishman; and if born in America, is he not an American? Has the negro no nationality? is he a vagabond upon our continent, without "a local habitation or a name?"</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Figuratively speaking, there is a spirit and a body to almost every thing. When we look at compacts or printed parchments, there is a spirit and a letter. The spirit of the Bible is life ever-lasting; the letter is dead in itself. The cold forms of religion are but crumbling clay; the spirit of religion is the embrace of the Lord Jesus. The Constitution of the United States is silent upon many things, all of which are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. All communities will determine the state of their society. The order of<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6184-00000097"/> society has not been changed in some of the States since the adoption of the Constitution, and that form of society was guaranteed to them by the spirit of the Constitution, however silent may be the letter. The negro is not without nationality; he is an American bondman. He is not a vagabond: he is heir to his master's care. He is not without a habitation or a name; he is the servant of his master, according to the appointment of God, through the prophet Noah.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. I know the negro is a servant, and the property of his master, or has been. I know, also, that is the mere effect of a political power. When that power ceases to exist, and he is no more the servant of his master, but a free man, where is his habitation and his name?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. You ask me a question that can only be answered by revolution. I can only give you my opinion, and that is, his friends must make him a country, a habitation, and a name. He can not live as an American freeman: any such an attempt will end in his annihilation.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Has not the boast of Americans been that this is "The land of the free, and the home of the brave?" Is there an American that is not proud of this republic? Can a government be a republic that does not extend liberty to the people? Is there a man so dead to the spirit of liberty that does not wish all men, everywhere, free?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. When freedom is spoken of, every one has an idea of what is meant; for every one has known what it is to live in freedom, and also what it is to live and act under restraint; but, then, it is obvious that different persons feel in freedom according to <emph>circumstances.</emph> Things which infringe upon the freedom of some, have no such effect upon <emph>others.</emph> So that in the same situation in which one would feel <emph>free,</emph> another would feel himself in <emph>bondage.</emph> Hence, it is evident that though <emph>all</emph> have a general idea of what freedom is, yet all have not the same idea of it. For, as different persons would not all be free in the same circumstances, it follows that freedom itself is not the same thing to <emph>all.</emph> Of course, the kinds of freedom are as many and various as the kinds of laws are by which we are all governed. An aged man is free to go to church with an old garment. Force it upon a young man, and he would think himself in <emph>bondage.</emph> An aged woman is free with her head beneath the covering of a cap; nay, is even proud of it. Force it upon a young woman, and she would be in <emph>bondage.</emph> A man educated to the law feels free in his library. Force him to the plow, and he would be in <emph>bondage.</emph> A negro educated as a slave is free at his master's work. Force him to provide for himself, and he is in <emph>bondage.</emph> Against the negro, as a race, I have no prejudice. If you would make him a free man, educate him for freedom. If you wish to overturn the decrees of Heaven, go at it with <emph>rationality.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. I can not believe that Heaven ever designed that one man should be the slave of another. I know the ancients held servants, and bought and<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6184-00000098"/> sold one another, and that the Jews were four hundred years in slavery, but have ever looked upon it as a relic of barbarism. I think mankind are but one family, and all have the natural right of freedom. Your speculations, in our last conversation, upon the origin of the negro, are not orthodox.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. I know not what you call orthodox. I know of no book that I esteem above the Bible; and if we are to take that as true, the negro, as an antediluvian, is not a man at all, of whom we have any historical account; but that he is an antediluvian, I make no question. After Noah's curse upon Canaan, we find him in the capacity of a servant. In that capacity is he a man? He is, to some extent. What constitutes a man? Why, <emph>responsibility.</emph> One may have the body of a man, but, without the mind, he is not responsible. Has the negro a mind equal with the white man? History answers, no. Is the negro responsible? He may be, to some extent. Is he to be regarded equal with the Fathers of the Church? By no means. Why? Because we believe in the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob. In what relation does the negro stand to those Fathers? Go to the history of the Patriarchs, and we will see. If we are to believe the negro the descendant of the Canaanites, you will find that God showed it unto Abraham that the seed of the promise could not descend through a Canaanite.</p> 
               <p>"And Abraham was old and well-stricken in age; and the Lord had blest Abraham in all things. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh; and I will make thee swear by the Lord God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son (Isaac) of the daughters of the Canaanites." Thus commences the twenty-fourth chapter of the book of Genesis; let the doubtful read the whole chapter. Then turn to the twenty-seventh chapter and forty-sixth verse: "And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?" Heth is a son of Canaan. See Genesis, x: 15. And you will find, by the commencement of the twenty-eighth chapter of the book of Genesis, that Isaac blessed Jacob, and charged him that he should not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. The prophet Zechariah, in speaking of <emph>Messiah's</emph> coming, in the fourteenth chapter and twenty-first verse, holds this language: "Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be holiness unto the Lord of hosts; and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and see the therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts."</p> 
               <p>When did the Canaanite grow out of all this reproach? or who hath lifted the weight from his shoulders? Where is the man that striveth against God? <q>

               <p>Any person that will read the ninth chapter of St. Paul's epistle to the <emph>Romans,</emph> in connection with the history of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the book of Genesis, will find a ready solution of the following remarkable passages in the ninth chapter of <emph>Romans:</emph> "For they are not all <emph>Israel</emph> which are of <emph>Israel.</emph> Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, <emph>are they all children:</emph> but in Isaac shall thy seed be called. Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. Shall the thing formed say unto him that formed <emph>it,</emph> Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?"</p> 
               <p>It is very clear that the Apostle is here alluding to races, and not to the ungodly of his own race. By reading the history of the Patriarchs, you will find that Abraham had other children, but the promise was in Isaac. You will find that Esau married a Canaanite woman, and sold his birthright to his brother Jacob for a mess of pottage. For the end of Esau, see the book of Obadiah. When we consider the different races of men, how appropriate the language of the Apostle: "Hath not the potter power over the clay," etc., to make two races of men, or one race and an limitation, or master and servant?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Do you affirm the doctrine that a negro is not a man at all?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. No; only that he is an inferior, subordinate man; that to him less is given and less required.</p> 
                
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. You take him into your churches, baptize him, and teach him that he has a soul.</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Does the Scriptures teach us that there are degrees in heaven?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. We know that there are degrees on earth. By keeping the commands of God we have the hope of heaven. When I return from that promised land I will tell you if there be degrees in heaven.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. I never expect to see you, you dark sinner. I believe you would destroy the best government in the world, and all the hope you have of heaven, to keep the negro in slavery.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. I can't see that slavery has any thing to do with the life of the government. Why do n't the Northern people abandon the use of cotton, sugar, rice, and tobacco, the products of slave labor? They wish to put the rebellion down, and some of them to destroy slavery, yet they bid fifty cents per pound for cotton, thus enabling the slave-driver to fight them as hard with one-fourth of a crop as he did in the beginning with a full crop. Besides, you increase the value of the slave's labor, and his master will hold on to him with greater tenacity. Abandon the use of those articles produced by the slave, and he will become as valueless in the South as he is in the North.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Abe. Ah! yes; but there are other countries that use these articles. Besides, it is the design of the God of the Universe that the products of every<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6184-00000100"/> country should go into the channels of commerce. We want the cotton, but we want the negro to raise it as a freeman.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Then you will never get your wants, you dark sinner. Every one that knows the negro, knows him to be a thriftless, ambitionless sluggard, who, if left to himself, would not raise cotton enough to cover himself.</p>

How oft you come, with friendly jokes and honest observation, bearing lights of justice in each hand, with shades of wise men's brows, to stir the sleeping, lazy sparks within the storehouse of the brain, to shine as brilliant lights! Amid the light of all this train, with necromancing hand, you steal the noblest gift of God to man. Where are your lean and hungry '<emph>brats,</emph>' bereaved of parents and of care, to stalk about the world? Where are your widows, that have watered with their tears the bloated forms you've made? Where are the hearts that are bleeding and have bled beneath your crushing wheels? Where is the man that's bold enough to say you never touched his blood?</p> 
               <p>"To the Federal camp-to seas of trouble-to h-ll! but I will not follow whisky." And Tom Steady thrust the butt of a double-barrel shot-gun into the mud; and then continued, addressing his companions:</p> 
               <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6184-00000101"/> 
               <p>"Burtice is drunk; the country is overrun with Federal soldiers; we are in hourly danger of capture. Burtice is not only drunk to-day, but he is drunk every day. He that it suits can stay with him-to-morrow's sun will find me in some other quarter. Burtice, through all the Kansas war, was a sober man, brave and skillful. Then I would have followed him to h-ll's dominions; but now his bravery-for that he never lacked-will lead us into trouble."</p> 
               <p>The face of day smiled upon the eastern hills, as Burtice rubbed his eyes and said, "Where are the boys?"</p> 
               <p>"They have disbanded. Some have gone to the Southern army; some have hidden their guns, and gone home to take the chances; and some have gone to the brush on their own hook," said his faithful lieutenant.</p> 
               <p>"Desperate men play desperate games. I tell you what it is: we can raise a troop of minute-men, pitch into the country, and arrest Lord Dunmore. A Union man of such a noted <emph>mark</emph> doth affect the country. By this daring, noble deed we will gain some reputation."</p> 
               <p>"No man that owns so many slaves can long endure the Union. Better let him slide."</p> 
               <p>"By red-faced Mars, the bloody god of war! if I can raise the men in all Stumptown, I will have him before yonder eye of day again opes, its lid upon this dirty ball."</p> 
               <p>"My lord, you are in an ill humor," said the mistress tress of Dunmore Palace, as the noble lord entered her parlor.</p> 
               <p>"Yes; a little fretted. I had some sharp words with Captain Spear and Major Blade; and they threatened to arrest me," said Lord Dunmore, rubbing his hands.</p> 
               <p>"Let them dare! Why, arrest you! they had better arrest Abe Lincoln, upon my word. When men get straps on their shoulders, they generally get too big for their breeches. Give yourself no uneasiness, my lord; their threats were but on the spur of the moment. There is the supper-bell. Come; you will feel better." <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>The shades of night were gathered round</l> 
                        <l>A country house, all cottage-bound:</l> 
                        <l>The slumbering slave dreamed in his rest</l> 
                        <l>That the poor man is the one oppressed.</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>"Be quiet," said Burtice, "or you will stir those d--d <emph>niggers!</emph> Some of them are awake all times of night."</p> 
               <p>Dunmore Palace was surrounded by the followers of Burtice. A hasty man burst open the door, as Lord Dunmore jumped out of his bed.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! you old sinner, we have got you," said Burtice.</p> 
               <p>"O Lord! O Lord!" said Lady Dunmore, as she left the room.</p> 
               <p>A young and accomplished daughter slept in a distant part of the house. Aroused by this strange noise, she hastily dressed and rushed into her<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6184-00000102"/> father's room, nothing daunted by the armed and ugly men, exclaiming, in a soft and persuasive voice, "O men! brave men! my father is the best Union man in all Missouri. He sent Major Blade to Stumptown, to drive off the rebels."</p> 
               <p>When the keen eye of the old man failed to warn the girl, he said, stoutly, "My daughter, these are Confederate troops."</p> 
               <p>The girl rushed into her mother's room, biting her lips, and uttering many long and bitter curses, mentally, upon the heads of those who first inaugurated the arrest of private citizens.</p> 
               <p>"Massa, hoss ready," said an imp of Africa, as Burtice and his party left the room with their prisoner.</p> 
               <p>A November sun licked the frost of the morning, as Burtice rode up to a country house many miles distant from Dunmore Palace.</p> 
               <p>"Huzza! huzza!" rang in merry notes from the mouth of every coming trooper. The inmates of the house rushed out to see the <emph>elephant.</emph> In double file the troopers marched until Burtice said "Halt!"</p> 
               <p>"Dixie! Dixie!" rang along the line. Two half-grown women sat upon the fence, and sang that celebrated song in all its <emph>variations.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>Lord Dunmore turned down his eyes, and dropped a bitter tear of anguish, for his heart was with the rebels.</p> 
               <p>"Do take something," said the lady of the house, addressing herself to Lord Dunmore, at the breakfast-table; and then, with a soft and persuasive voice, continued: "I will insure your life for <emph>ten cents.</emph> The 'boys' will not hurt a hair upon your head."</p> 
               <p>Lord Dunmore grew more cheerful, and <emph>whispered</emph> in the ear of that lady-"Do send word to my poor distressed family that I am <emph>safe.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Do with him?" said General Missouri. "Why, I will turn him loose. The arrest of private citizens is like a war on women."</p> 
               <p>Burtice was offered a place in the Southern army. The hankering spirit of friendly corn lured him back to Stumptown. The decree had gone forth from head-quarters in Missouri-<emph>Death to all bush whackers!</emph> Though Burtice did not consider him self a "bushwhacker," yet his dissipation had rendered it impossible for him to get followers, and one of two alternatives were only presented to him. It was, first, to surrender himself to the Federal authorities; or, second, to defend himself as best he could. He chose the latter. Squads of Federal soldiers were passing in almost every direction through this part of the country.</p> 
               <p>Burtice found it necessary to lay aside his gun; but he still retained a pair of Colt's revolvers and a Bowie-knife, and resolved that he would not be taken alive. It was difficult for the Federals to know him without information, or recognize him as an enemy at a distance, as his weapons were concealed. Yet it was soon known in camp that Burtice was in the neighborhood, and every means set on foot for his capture. And, upon one occasion,<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6184-00000103"/> Burtice took the horse of an officer, who had left his noble charger hitched to the fence, and went into a certain house to look for Burtice. And when he made inquiry of the inmates concerning Burtice, a lady, pointing out the window, said:</p> 
               <p>"Yonder he goes, riding off your horse."</p> 
               <p>The officer was most furious for a few moments; but there was no other horse on the plantation.</p> 
               <p>"Where are your horses?" demanded the enraged man.</p> 
               <p>"They have been 'pressed' into the service, sir," was the calm reply.</p> 
               <p>Finding neither man nor horse, he resolved not to make war on women and children, and quietly submitted to his fate, without swearing, until his comrades coming up shortly after, and learning the particulars, laughed at him immoderately, and he swore most furiously.</p> 
               <p>Enlivened by this success, Burtice partook heavily of the "O be joyful!" and, as the same party returned to camp, Burtice followed close behind them, riding up to every house they had passed, and inquired if they had seen any "Feds;" and, on being informed in the affirmative, he would clap the spurs to the officer's noble charger, saying: "By h-ll! I'll catch 'em yet."</p> 
               <p>The sun at last rose upon a fatal day to Burtice. He went early in the morning to the town of --, seven miles from the Federal camp, and commenced drinking in an "O be joyful" house. Here he met many sunshine friends, some of whom were most intimate, and very liberal with the "O be joyful!" Burtice lost his balance. A macaroon sped to the Federal camp. Burtice was telling and hearing of hair-breadth escapes, etc., when the voice of the wind said:</p> 
               <p>"The Federals are coming!"</p> 
               <p>Burtice rushed to his horse, and quickly loosened him from the post. As he raised his left foot to the stirrup, the right refused to bear his weight. This unexpected failure frightened the horse, who snorted and pranced, for he was a high-mettled animal.</p> 
               <p>By this time some thirty Federals were in full view, and several rushed immediately upon Burtice, who, finding that he could not mount his horse, squared himself and drew his pistols. As they rushed upon him, he kept pulling the triggers, but produced no fire. A moment's glance revealed to him that they had been deprived of their caps. A ball from a Federal gun passed through his bowels, and they were still firing close upon him. No time was to be lost. He threw his pistols at the heads of his pursuers, and then, rushing upon them with his Bowie-knife, wounded one severely in the arm, as he threw it up to ward off the blow. But bravery and resolution must fail and fall beneath both treachery and power; and with it Burtice fell, pierced through the body with no less than four musket-balls. He was taken, ruthlessly, to the Federal camp, where he soon after died, cursing his captors with his last breath.</p> 
               <p>Old Father Tearful, an aged and pious man, and<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6184-00000104"/> great-uncle of Susan, the wife of Burtice, was selected by the neighbors as the most suitable person to convey the sad intelligence to the family. Leaning upon his staff, and with a heavy heart, he set out, late in the evening, upon his mission. When he have in sight of the house that sheltered the happy family, his heart faltered, and he paused. The smoke gently rising from the chimney, and curling up toward the heavens, seemed to say, "O, Father! do not disturb me?" A little reflection gave him resolution, and he pressed forward to meet one whom he had often petted upon his knee in childhood.</p> 
               <p>The wife of Burtice, very different from him, was as temperate as the mother of Sampson, endeavoring to bring up her children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. But she loved Burtice, and the old man knew it; and duty alone nerved him to approach her with this sad intelligence.</p> 
               <p>Let the reader imagine an old man, trembling with the weight of age, standing before a woman, who, in the summer of her days, crushes and falls beneath the weight of the "still small voice" from the old man's lips.</p> 
               <p>Morning had come, and Uncle Tearful returned to the house of Burtice, to warn the family of some arrangements necessary for the last honors due to the dead. The utter derangement of every thing about the house told how sadly and how tearfully the night had been spent. Susan had passed through her river of tears, and was sad and calm. She silently lently listened to all the old man said. The old man's attention was arrested by the loud sobs of a little son of Burtice, about six years of age, who sat upon the corner of the hearth-stone. Uncle Tearful, willing to be a comforter as far as possible, placed his hand upon the little fellow's head, saying:</p> 
               <p>"My son, don't weep: we all have got to die."</p> 
               <p>"I know it," said the little fellow, rising up; "I am not crying for that: I am crying because I ain't a MAN!"</p> 
               <p>"Why, my son, there are five hundred Federals at the camp; and, if you were a man, what could you do?"</p> 
               <p>"I reckon I could shoot the man that took the caps off father's pistols."</p> 
               <p>"Who told you that? I never--" and the old man looked at Susan.</p> 
               <p>"I know you never told me; but you told mother, and I heard her, last night, when she prayed; and she prayed for him: that's the way I know it."</p> 
               <p>"My son, you must grow to be a man, and read the good Book that teaches us that we must pray for our enemies, and those that despitefully use us;" and the old man's voice trembled as he spoke.</p> 
               <p>"I don't know what I will do when I am <emph>big;</emph> but I know, if I was <emph>big</emph> now, I would n't pray for him."</p> 
               <p>Susan gathered the child in her arms. The old man left the painful scene, leaning upon his staff; and we will left you do the same.</p>

               <p>"O! O! O! O is the first letter that a child learns. O-u-t-<emph>out</emph> of my prison-house; <emph>out</emph> of the grasp of my enemies; almost <emph>out</emph> of breath; <emph>out</emph> of friends; almost <emph>out</emph> of my senses; and in the woods." And Cora sat down upon an old mossy log, for rest and reflection.</p> 
               <p>"Why did I not grab the fool's pistol? I may as well have had something to defend myself with." And Cora looked all around for pursuers. Nothing met her eye save the dense forest that surrounded her; for she was not pursued.</p> 
               <p>And while we leave Major Six in deep conference with his officers, after the escape of Cora, as explained in a preceding chapter, we will follow her.</p> 
               <p>"O, you heaven-born infant!" said Cora, as she plucked a flower that came creeping round the mossy side of the old log; "your rainbow colors remind me of the covenant between the God of heaven and Father Noah: that God would restrain his anger, and all the nations of the earth should be blessed."</p> 
                
               <p>And Cora pressed the flower to her bosom; her nerves were relaxed; she no longer thought of blood; she was herself again. But to find refuge. Being rested, she plodded her way through the woods, taking a south-west course. Coming suddenly upon a small neighborhood road, she hesitated. When a wagon hove in sight, being driven by a negro boy some eighteen years of age, in which was seated a young lady, marked with the equipage of fashion and style, Cora grew brave, as she said, mentally, "The women are not persecutors."</p> 
               <p>"Whoa! whoa!" said Little Sis to the negro's horses, as the wagon was rolling past Cora. "Will you ride, miss?"</p> 
               <p>"O Cora!"-"O Sis!" And the two girls were soon in each other's arms, regardless of muddy wheels.</p> 
               <p>Reader! you no doubt remember Cora and Little Sis, at the boarding-school in the city of P--; the writing of compositions by Cora for Little Sis, and otherwise the greatest childish attachment. Hear them patiently.</p> 
               <p>"Cora, what in the wide world are you doing here?"</p> 
               <p>"Making my escape from the Federal camp."</p> 
               <p>"O, my God! you a prisoner; and for what?"</p> 
               <p>"God only knows; perhaps 't is Southern blood."</p> 
               <p>"O no, no, no; that can not be. Cora, my father is a colonel in the Missouri State militia; but you must go home with me. I will guarantee your safety."</p> 
               <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6184-00000106"/> 
               <p>"I appreciate your kindness; but I have escaped in a most singular manner, and must make my retreat sure."</p> 
               <p>Here Cora told Little Sis her whole story, and received that of Little Sis, which was-that having paid a visit to a neighbor, her horse had broken loose, and as her father's boy came by with the wagon, she had embraced the opportunity of returning home in it. Now it was settled that, as Cora was afraid to call at the home of Little Sis, the latter should furnish Cora with a horse and saddle, to enable her to reach the house of a friend, some five miles distant, that evening, for the sun was low. Matters being thus arranged, Little Sis held the negro boy's horses at the gate, until he procured the horse, and Cora mounted and sped westward.</p> 
               <p>While Little Sis is making some deceitful explanations to her mother and father, we observe the negro boy that drove the wagon in solemn council with old Uncle Ike, a colored fellow-servant.</p> 
               <p>"I tell you, Uncle Ike, dat gal ought to be coch. She done got away. I heard her talk to young miss. She mighty fraid de Major coch her. Dat's so!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, den, why don't you go tell Massa Jim? He soon have her brought back; he do n't care nothin' 'bout Sis."</p> 
               <p>"Massa Jim ain't no Union man; he's just 'tending. I tell you, Uncle Ike, dat blue-button coat have to come off'n him fore nigger gets to be white folks. Dat's so. But yonder comes Sam Careless; he'll do to hitch to. I go tell him. He's going right to de camp, by golly!"</p> 
               <p>An interview took place between Careless and the negro boy; and while we leave Sam on his way to camp, we will follow Cora.</p> 
               <p>As the sun sank behind the western hills Cora entered the door of an old and valued friend of her father.</p> 
               <p>"Do n't stay, child," said Aunt Nancy; "Go into town, and there you will get with the girls. God knows! they may hunt you. And leave the horse here. What if they do find him? he belongs to Colonel Jim, one of their own stripe. God knows! they can search this house until they are tired. That they have done before, often, often. My child, I will tell them you have left here, and they had as well look for the grave of Moses. Trust that to me, and go forward." And Aunt Nancy raised her spectacles upon her forehead, as she continued: "If they fool round me more than a necessary search of this house, I will knock some of them on the head with the shovel."</p> 
               <p>In the dusk of the evening Cora departed for the town of --, where she was kindly received at the house of Mr. -- by two maiden rebels.</p> 
               <p>Loudfork had returned to camp from a scout upon which he was absent when Cora escaped, and, placing one hand upon his hip, as he gently pulled his whiskers with the other, said to Major Six: "I have had a conversation with Sam Careless, and he received his information from an intelligent contraband; and,<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6184-00000107"/> by James the Just, I know the very house to which this mocking-bird has flown."</p> 
               <p>"I think we will bring her back, and tell her that we only meant her to have a little exercise," said the Major, gravely.</p> 
               <p>"What do you want here?" said Aunt Nancy, as Loudfork presented himself at the door, late in the night, musket in hand.</p> 
               <p>"Want to see what's here, madam," said Loudfork, as he entered the room.</p> 
               <p>Having searched all the rooms, Loudfork sent men to the stable, who, returning, brought forth the said horse.</p> 
               <p>"The person that rode this horse here, madam; we want that person. Those who conceal are equally guilty with those that offend. We will take no excuse."</p> 
               <p>"I conceal nothing, sir. You have searched this house-I think this is the ninth time, and you never found the rappings of one's finger yet out of the way. Four or five times you searched for my old man, whom I told you you would never find, and then for guns, and then for contraband of war, as you said, and now you come to search for strangers, and, I suppose, you will next come to search for the grave of Moses; and I will have no more of this searching, and none of your impudence," said the old lady, as she gathered a large iron shovel, and chased Loudfork out of the house. The party returned, taking Colonel Jim's horse to camp.</p> 
                
               <p>Cora learned from the rebel maidens that Don Partlo was encamped in a hewed-log house, some distance from the town of --, in an out-of-the-way place; and one of them agreed to accompany her on the following day to see him, as she hoped to learn from him something of her father, and get his assistance in some way to leave the country.</p> 
               <p>While the girls were passing off the weary hours of the night in conversation upon the dangers of the enterprise of the morrow, Major Six and Loudfork held a secret and solemn caucus upon the case of Jack Jolly; the latter striving hard to bring him to a court-martial; the former strongly insisting that he should, by some stratagem, be shifted into a Missouri command. But no terms being settled, Jack remained in the company pretty much his own commander. Long before it was light the enthusiastic girls were on the road to the said hewed-log house.</p> 
               <p>The morning sun had just unvailed his beaming face, and looked across the broad and beautiful prairie, as Cora and Lue gained the summit of a hill that brought them in sight of the hewed-log house. The curling smoke that arose from its roof threw the girls into amazement. They hesitated. In a few moments they discovered that the house was on fire, and surrounded by Federal soldiers. "O God!" said Lue, grasping Cora by the hand, and they fled to the bushes. The house was soon burned to the ground, and the soldiers, in a merry troop, left the premises. With cautions feet and<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6184-00000108"/> tearful eyes the girls approached the smoldering ruins. "O God! is that a man's skull?" said Cora; and Lue, with a long pole, turned over one side of a white earthen bowl.</p> 
               <p>Having satisfied themselves, from all the appearances, that Don Partlo and his men had either made their escape or were taken off as prisoners by the party that had just left, the girls turned their steps toward home, where they arrived about the middle of the day. Cora was much dejected, and Lue said "she would have a little select party that evening, at which there would be none present but rebel people." Still Cora was sad, and took no delight in the company, and her spirit refused to be cheerful, both for her own commands and those of her comrades. It was now late in the night, and some of the company had dispersed. A stranger entered the room in company with one who was acquainted with the girls. He was recognized by no one in that house save Cora. It was Don Partlo, in disguise. The spirit of our Cora almost burst its prison-house. She trembled, and turned red and white, but managed to conceal herself from the gaze of the company.</p> 
               <p>Don Partlo artfully contrived to place in the hand of Cora a hastily-written note, unobserved by the company, and departed.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVII.</head> 
               <p>"BY two-faced Janus, the Grecian god, that saw the misty future of the world, and knew the deeds of men before they were performed, if I could ope prophetic eyes, and see that double-headed demi-god, I would invoke him on the spot to shape for me an argument. But yonder comes my pale-faced friend, that holds such a holy horror of color, armed with books containing deeds of men, both ancient and renowned. I will descant from common sense, and own I have not read.</p> 
               <p>"Good morning, Jeff. As you have come to close this argument, and, as you know, I am a straight Republican, believing, with our sacred Constitution, that <emph>all men</emph> are born free and equal, I must put upon you the burden of the proof that could lead us otherwise.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. I do deny that men are <emph>born</emph> at all. I will admit, for the sake of the argument, that children are sometimes born, but neither free nor equal. They are born subject to their parents, and their parents are subject to the laws of the society in which they<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6184-00000109"/> live. The Declaration of American Independence, for to that, I suppose, you do allude, simply means that no man in this country is born to rule, or born a prince. Our fathers, when about setting up the government, thought it expedient to declare that it should not be a monarchy. Hence the Declaration was appropriate to this country-not to others. As to the <emph>all men,</emph> they could have only meant those over whom the government had control.</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. I must again allude to the origin of the negro, or to our first knowledge of him. Flavius Josephus, the learned historian of the Jews, in Book I, "Antiquities of the Jews," chapter vi, page 31, section 3, holds the following language: "Noah, when, after the deluge, the earth was resettled in its former condition, set about its cultivation; and when he had planted it with vines, and when the fruit was ripe, and he had gathered the grapes in their season, and the wine was ready for use, he offered sacrifice, and feasted, and being drunk, he fell asleep, and lay naked in an unseemly manner. When his youngest son saw this, he came laughing, and showed him to his brethren; but they covered their father's nakedness. And when Noah was made sensible of what had been done, he prayed for posterity to his other sons; but for Ham, he did not curse him, <emph>by reason of his nearness in blood,</emph> but cursed his posterity. And when the rest of them escaped that curse, God inflicted it on the children of Canaan."</p> 
               <p>The laughing at a drunken man at the present day would certainly not be regarded as a criminal offense; yet, in the days of the Patriarchs, drunkenness had not produced the misery in the world that it since has. In the present organization of society, Noah himself would have been the greatest offender. But we must conclude that the crime of Ham was not very great; yet it was an offense.</p> 
               <p>We find in the account of this affair, as given by Josephus, some <emph>remarkable facts.</emph> First: He did not curse Ham because he was his son; for what else is meant by <emph>nearness of blood?</emph> Second: When the rest of them escaped that curse, (what <emph>rest?</emph> Cush, Miram, and Put, Ham's sons, we take it,) Josephus gives no reason why they escaped; and what better reason can be given than <emph>nearness of blood?</emph> God inflicted it upon the children of Canaan. And why?<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6184-00000110"/> Because they were of a different blood, and only fit for servants. This is my interpretation of the whole matter. Him that is zealous that there is but one family of man, let him hear the same witnesses: Josephus-Book I, "Antiquities of the Jews," chapter iv, page 32, section 1: "These kings laid waste all Syria, and overthrew the offspring of the <emph>giants.</emph>" Again-Book V, chapter ii, page 105, section 3: "There were till then left the race of <emph>giants,</emph> who had bodies so large, and countenances so entirely different from other men, that they were surprising to the sight and terrible to the hearing. The bones of these men are still shown to this very day, unlike to any credible relations of other men." And in the book of Joshua, the sixth book of the Bible, you find, in chapter xii, verse 4: "And the coast of Og, king of Bashan, which was of the remnants of the <emph>giants.</emph> Them did Moses, the servant of the Lord, and the children of Israel smite." Therefore, we conclude that the descendants of Adam are not <emph>all</emph> of the race of men. To the truth of the account given of Adam and Eve, and of their fall, we make no objection, but is that the whole truth, or all of it? <q>

               <p>To the testimony of those ancient writers let me add the evidence of Sir Charles Lyell, F. R. S. In his "Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man," chapter xx, page 385, he says: "When speaking, in a former work, of the distinct races of mankind, I remarked that 'if all the leading varieties of the human family sprang originally from a single pair, (a doctrine to which then, as now, I could see no valid objection,) a much greater lapse of time was required for the slow and gradual formation of such races as the Caucasian, Mongolian, and Negro, than was embraced in any of the popular systems of chronology. In confirmation of the high antiquity of two of these, I referred to pictures on the walls of ancient temples in Egypt, in which, a thousand years, or more, before the Christian era, the Negro and Caucasian physiognomies were portrayed as faithfully, and in as strong contrast, as if the like-nesses of these races had been taken yesterday. In relation to the same subject, I dwelt on the slight modification which the negro has undergone, after having been transported from the tropics and settled for more than two centuries in the temperate climate of Virginia. I therefore concluded that, 'if the various races were all descended from a single pair, <emph>we must allow for a vast series of antecedent ages,</emph> in the course of which the long-continued influence of external circumstances gave rise to peculiarities, increased in many successive generations, and at length fixed by hereditary transmission.'" Upon the evidence of Sir Charles Lyell, shall we assert the Bible false? By no means. We choose to assert that it does not sustain the doctrine that the family of man are descended from a single pair.</p>

I have been a pretty close reader of the Bible, and I would refer any white man, that believes the Canaanite to be his brother, to the seventh chapter of the book of <title>Deuteronomy.</title> Moses was of the opinion that the Canaanites should be utterly destroyed, but Solomon, the wise king of the Hebrews, and man of God, held them as <emph>slaves.</emph> Hear Josephus, in the eighth book, "Antiquities of the Jews," sixth chapter, page 172, section 3: "But King Solomon subdued to himself the remnant of the Canaanites, that had not before submitted to him; those I mean that dwell in Mount Lebanon, and as far as the city of Hamath, and ordered them to pay tribute. He also chose out of them every years such as were to serve him in the meanest offices, and to do his domestic work, and to follow husbandry; for none of the Hebrews were servants (in such low employments). He appointed also five hundred and fifty rulers over those Canaanites who were reduced to such domestic <emph>slavery.</emph>" A parallel to this passage in Josephus you may find in Second Chronicles, eighth chapter, seventh, eighth, and ninth verses. The word <emph>infidel</emph> is of easy manufacture, and is often the port into which theologians sail when hard pressed by any one who may chance to differ from them in their peculiar views of God and the Bible. What constitutes belief in the Bible, if we are to reject its plain passages unless they receive the favor of some sanctified brow? And as to the truth of history-do you mean that there is a nation under the sun clear of the tarnish of <emph>slavery?</emph> No, not even infidel France. And England! O, virtuous England!

As to the kind treatment toward servants, whether European or American, whether North or South, whether white or black, it generally comes a little like a hard winter on the poor. They are not quite frozen by the cold neglect of their superiors; for it is a general law of nature, that the strong live upon the weak. In every department of her various channels, you will find the strong oppressing and overrunning the weak. He that would alter this law must assume divinity. In the language of the English poet: <q>

You have said much in opposition to the freedom of the Canaanites. What evidence have you that the colored people of this country are the descendants of the Canaanites?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. I must confess that there is a difference between a bought and a hired servant; but it is merely a matter of taste. All men are servants in some sense. I do not believe the African would do well as a hired servant. Having less of the stamp of the living God, his natural tendency is to barbarism and theft. If we consult the Bible, we find the Prophet Moses, and others that consulted with the living God, were of the opinion that the Canaanites should, in course of time, be utterly destroyed. Their future destiny is in the womb of time. Who can see the fate of that portion of them now in this country, when one portion of their superiors say that they shall be free, and another portion of them say they shall remain slaves? Does not a "<emph>still small voice</emph>" say that they may not be at all? How<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6184-00000113"/> many of the poor creatures have felt the oppressing hand, in a northern clime, not of slavery, but of death!</p> 
               <p>As to their being the descendants of Canaan, we find in Samuel Maunder's "History of the World," volume I, (Outline Sketch of General History,) chapter xi, page 36, the historian, after assigning different settlements to the sons and grandsons of Noah, continues, in the following language:</p> 
               <p>"But Canaan is generally allowed to have settled in Phoenicia, and to have founded those nations which inhabited Judea, and were, for the most part, subsequently exterminated by the Jews."</p> 
               <p>Again, (same history,) in the 2d volume, page 409, in the "History of Algiers," in the north of Africa, and blossom of the barbarous tribes of that country, the historian, in speaking of its early settlement, holds this language:</p> 
               <p>"There is a variety of opinions respecting the original inhabitants: some contending that they were the Sabians, who plundered the Patriarch Job; others, Canaanites, who were driven out of their country by Joshua."</p> 
               <p>The early history of man is shrouded in mystery; but, with the best lights before us, we can come to no other conclusion than that the colored people of this country and of Africa are the descendants of Canaan.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jeff. Before you leave, let me sum up what I have said of his origin and destiny. With regard to there being other men after the flood, diverse to the family of Noah, I must again refer you to <emph>Josephus,</emph> Book I, "Antiquities of the Jews," chapter iv, section 1: "Now the sons of Noah were three, Shem, Japheth, and Ham, born one hundred years before the deluge. <emph>These</emph> first of all descended from the mountains into the plains and fitted their habitations there, and persuaded <emph>others,</emph> who were greatly afraid of the lower grounds on account of the flood, and so were very loth to come down from higher places, to venture to follow their examples. "Now, we are informed by Josephus, and also by the Holy Scriptures, that there were but eight persons saved in the ark, namely, Noah and his wife, and his three sons and their wives. The question then naturally arises, What <emph>others</emph> did Shem, Japheth, and Ham persuade to come down from the mountains? Was it the Patriarch Noah, the man of God, who received the covenant of the rainbow that the world should not again be destroyed by water? Or was it children born to them after the flood, whose eyes never opened upon the deluge, that had to be persuaded by eye-witnesses of that event that there was no danger in coming down? It seems to me, in all soberness, that the original of the <emph>giants,</emph> and of <emph>Canaan,</emph> may have by some means escaped the flood. The <emph>giants</emph> are antediluvian, as you may see by the sixth chapter of the book of Genesis. As to the family of Noah, I believe that they descended from Adam and Eve; the original of the <emph>others</emph> I leave<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6184-00000114"/> with the God of the creation. Hence we come to the following inevitable conclusions: First, that the African is an inferior and a different race. Second, that no permanent amalgamation can be effected between the races of blacks and whites, because it is contrary to the laws of nature and the designs of heaven. The mulatto can be produced, but can not be maintained without the constant application of the first means of production; for the blood will run back to the original race. This fact, though it has not been closely observed, is as true as that water will seek its level. I know an African boy whose great grandfather was a white man, yet there is not one trace of that blood in his veins. There can be no mistake in his genealogy, for the white blood is on the maternal side, his grandmother being a mulatto. Yet, any one unacquainted with the circumstances would unhesitatingly pronounce him <q>

                  </q> Let me again refer you to Sir Charles Lyell's "Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man," chapter xxiii, page 456. He says: "It is an acknowledged fact that the color and features of the negro or European are entirely lost in the fourth generation, provided that no fresh infusion of one or other of the two races takes place." Third, if we are to believe the Bible, and take into consideration the history of the past, and raise the mystic vail of the future, and contemplate the fact that the surface of the earth must one day become crowded with the family of man, insomuch that the whole surface of the earth will be necessary, in its strictest economy, for his support, the Canaanite will be <emph>exterminated.</emph> Josephus, in giving the farewell address of Moses to his people, "Antiquities of the Jews," Book IV, chapter viii, page 96, section 42, gives us this language of the man of God: "When you have beaten your enemies in battle, slay those that fought against you; but preserve others alive, that they may pay you tribute, excepting the nation of the <emph>Canaanites;</emph> for, as to that people, you must entirely destroy them." A parallel to this passage in Josephus you may find in the twentieth chapter of Deuteronomy, the fifth book of the Bible, verses 16, 17, and 18. But that necessity will not be upon the world for many generations yet to come. I am aware that many will dissent from my views upon this subject, and perhaps make long and prayerful efforts to elevate the Canaanite; and that they will do it honestly, I do not question. From a life experience with that people, in connection with my knowledge of the Bible and of history, I believe, God being my judge, that they will find themselves in a <emph>nest of unclean birds.</emph> Time proves all things, and I am willing that my views upon this subject shall go down to posterity. At the same time, I am willing to leave all who differ with me upon this subject free to enjoy whatever opinion they may have, and to try whatever<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6184-00000115"/> experiment may suit them with that people. He that touches the African in any other capacity than that of a servant, and is not tarnished by that touch, will prove something that I have not yet experienced.</p>

               <p>Bob Beabout had left on his own hook. Some said that he had thrown his gun away, and gone home to take the chances; others, that he had gone South.</p> 
               <p>Amid all these gloomy stories, Cora smiled through her tears when the Colonel told her that Mary Hawkeye was restored to her father's love, and had been married to Claudius Fairfield. [This is the pale man to whom the reader was introduced, in a preceding chapter, playing cards with Captain Sturn, in a village tavern.]</p> 
               <p>Second marriages are by some condemned, and perhaps very justly. But Mary was in the summer of life. Her mother had been laid in the cold confines of the tomb. Her father, always a stern and cold man, was now too far gone with dissipation to be of any solace to his daughter; but the controlling<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6184-00000117"/> pivot on which her determination turned was, that Claudius Fairfield was her first love.</p> 
               <p>He had been wrested from her, in early life, by a cold, heartless woman, that was Mary's superior in nothing but beauty, who captivated Claudius, and led him away from Mary, only to crush him beneath the cold charities of her affections. But Claudius was a true man, and he forgave Mary for her unfortunate adventure with the Missouri trapper. Many years had passed away since Claudius and Mary spent those happy hours of youth and ardor; but, like the rising of the morning sun, that silvers the eastern hills, they returned.</p> 
               <p>The wedding-day was set; and while we leave Mary preparing for her second bridal-day, we will turn and observe Rosa and Dolla in solemn council.</p> 
               <p>"Yes; but I reckon you will call him pa," said Rosa, very pointedly.</p> 
               <p>"Ma can make me call him pa with my lips," said Dolla, pouting out her mouth.</p> 
               <p>"Yes; but he will be your pa, and you will have to call him <emph>that,</emph>" said Rosa, sternly.</p> 
               <p>"My pa is in heaven, and you know it," said little Dolla, as her eyes floated in water.</p> 
               <p>Jesus said, "Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of heaven."</p> 
               <p>Cora clapped her hands in joy when informed that Major Six and Loudfork had been cashiered, and dropped a tear of exultation when she received the news that Jack Jolly had been promoted. It was by the influence of Cora that Colonel S--, with herself and Don Partlo, departed for Texas, leaving the border strife to be carried on by others. Her poetic speech, made to Don Partlo on that occasion, beneath the thick foliage of the forest, is worthy of record. It is as follows:</p> 
               <p>"Suicide! ah, 't is suicide, the spilling of homogeneous blood, the relentless stab of nature's soft nurse-bold, ungodly self-destruction! No country has ever adorned the world with men so brave, so noble, and so kind; no battle-field was ever won with men so brave. Mexico, Texas, our own native soil, record, in letters of blood, the character of American arms. Shall the hand that never turned aside from a relentless foe cowardly bleed the parent heart? for suicide is cowardice. Who but a coward will sneak into the secret chambers of his own heart, to steal the gift of God? Who but a coward will refuse to fill the place marked out for him by applauding heaven? Who but a coward will shrink from the storms of human life, and seek refuge in the shades of eternity? None! no, not one! Then this strife is suicide, and suicide is cowardice. <q>
