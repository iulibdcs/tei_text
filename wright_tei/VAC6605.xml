UPON  an occasion similar to this, I once remarked, that " it was customary for a writer, on launching his frail bark, to jump up in the bow, and make 'quite a bow-wow   about it." This, alas! is no longer true; and curt as was the author's bow, it is now curtailed. No lon- ger does he lead his bantling to the foot-lights, and civilly present her to the audience, but cavalierly thrusts her before them, without a word, or even the scant courtesy of Mr. Merri- man-who leaps into the ring, scrapes the saw- dust, and cracks his whip, with a familiar "Here you are, ladies and gentlemen."

I certainly have nothing either to do or to say, except thus to enter my protest against a modern innovation, that would deprive the Courteous Reader-so often invoked by the old School of Romancers--f a slight but time- honored mark of respect.

No Castle-in-the-air, nor Fancy-built Mansion, is this, our Piney Woods Tavern, but a sub- stantial structure, of hewn logs, very material indeed in their nature. No creatures of the brain, are these, the performers in our merry comedy, but living, breathing, moving-some of them very moving -mortals. The time of action is subsequent to the era of annexation, but prior to that of the intro- duction of Railways-those Juggernauts of civi- lization, destined soon to trample all the ro- mance of the wilds through which they pass, beneath the remorseless hoofs of their Iron Horse, and to frighten Nature's unsophisticated children with his abominable shriek.

Thank Heaven, there will long be many a dense thicket, where bear and panther, wolf and wild-cat, may find refuge; many a prai- rie where gentle doe and timid fawn can feed in peace; many a broad league of primeval forest, where stalwart oaks and lofty pines will rear their lofty heads proudly, and in safety from the desecrating axe-whose virgin soil, uncontaminated by cotton, cane, or corn, un- scathed by plough, mattock, or hoe, will gene- rously nurture a thousand varieties of wild flowers, that fill the eye with beauty and the air with fragrance.   THE PINEY WOODS' TAVERN. CHAPTER I. CEEKS AND CAP IMES.-A DUKING A   A De1YaNG. Ir any one is dissatisfied with the chills of a Northern winter, let him emigrate to Texas, mount a Spanish tacky, or cane pony, put off into the prairie, and face a January norther for half a day -being, probably, when overtaken by it, at least twenty miles fom any where or any body. If, after so salutary an experience, he be not perfectly satisfied with Southern hibernals, or is in the least disposed to grumble at snow, sleet, or ice in their proper times and places, he must be a hard man indeed, to suit, or to convince. On a fine warm morning of the aforesaid treach- erous month, my companion-a Galveston lawyer "    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6605-00000008"/> 12    ACREE AND CAMP FIRES. -and I, mounted our American horses at the door of a small tavern some thirty miles west of Houston, and set forth upon our journey-toward the up-country. Blue and cloudless were the heavens, balmy and spring-like the air, bright and warm the sun, and though the prairie trail was-from the com- bined presence of an unlimited quantity of mud and water-in about as deplorable a condition as one could well imagine, yet, exhilarated by the beauty of the day, our spirits rose, and our horses fresh and in fine condition, pushed forward at a famous rate. Our starting had been of the latest. My com- panion, Milward, had been detained a full hour, by the landlord who wished to consult him upon business-for every man in Texas, even if too poor to own a horse or cow, is the proprietor of at least one lawsuit, and no lawyer who rides the circuit can well call at half a dozen houses without picking up a job-and so the sun was well up when we set forth. After all it mattered but little; our day's ride and its termination were all c1lked out by cir- cumstances beyond our contro- for the next house of call was distant thirty miles, and the traveller in Texas who desires to pay for what accommoda- tiof he and his horse may receive, and who does   A PATRIOTIC MELLODY.     3 not wish to " camp out ;" must cut his " coat ac- cording to his cloth," arrange his day's journey according to his stopping places. Our day's ride-barring accidents-therefore, l arrcnged itself-as the French say. Unless we intended to compel our steeds to a double day's work, Malden must find us a shelter for the night, for not an inn, and in fact but one house was to be met with on our road, for thirty miles beyond. A few moments brought us to a creek of highly i respectable dimensions. It had been reported' us by travellers, the previous evening, as in :tir crossing condition, pretty well up, but not swim- ming. I looked at Milward, and Milward looked at me. We both whistled-not "Yankee Doodle," "Hail Columbia," or any ordinary tune, patriotic or sentimental, but a prolonged, melancholy, mo- notonous note, which is used to express in musical language, that the musician is suddenly taken aback, and has decidedly put his foot in it. We knew the creek well; in whatever order it might have been the previous night, the fact was perfectly transparent, indeed as clear as mud, that if we intended to cross this stream, it could only be done by swimming.  We dismounted, unstrapped saddle-blankets,        ,       \    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6605-00000009"/> "    CREEMK AND CAMP FIR . and took off saddle-bags; remounted, threw bags and blankets over our shoulders, withdrew our feet from our stirrups, and in we and the horses went; three steps and our horses lost their footing; a peculiarly cooling sensation about the limbs, and a prominent portion of the nether man, which proved conclusively that if the horses could not touch bottom, the water could; a swim of a couple of rods; a struggle at the opposite bank; and we were landed, safe but certainly not quite sound-if water-damage be taken into considera- tion. In the narrow belt of timber that skirted the farther side of the creek, we found as usual, a smoking, smouldering log-the remnants of a camp fire; and having held-a council of war upon the subject, determined to call and dry off-for fair though the morning might be, there was yet something in its exceeding fairness that made us fear for the evening. Before us, ndt a house could be found within fifteen miles, save one, and that far off to the right, and distant at least two miles from the road. So, dismounting, we re- moved the bits from our horses, mouths, took the caberos from the saddle-bow, and securing the animals, by fastening one end of the rope to a clog of wood, the other being around their necks,   Ma COrNTrs MA.

Shortly after, i snort from our horses, apprised us of the approach of something or somebody; then, a whicker from the same intelligent quarter announced that some of their kind were on the way, and in a few moments we heard at a dis- tance, the voices and laughter of men. "Ten chances to one, now," said Milward, " that they are some disagreeable fellows, for you know the next settlement does not enjoy a very amiable reputation, too many of old Yokum's people stopped there to roost, after their compulsory flight from Liberty County."- "Perhaps," said I, "but here we can stop until they pass, and it's not at all likely they'll want to force their company upon us; if they try it, they won't succeed." Here, a shrill pipe, whistling a tune that years ago was particularly popular at down-east train- ings, and known then as "my wife is sick," smote my ear. A countryman, whether I know him or not," said H" genuine Yankee and no mistake." "Well, you've served out Macheth, as badly as the person of that name treated both sleep and old Duncan, and I fear you are no more correct in your conclusion than in your quotation;" re-    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6605-00000010"/> 16     OREBKS AND CAMP FilEB. plied Milward, "how do yeu recognize a fellow Yankee?" "By acoustics," I answered, "do you hear that infernal tune the fellow's whistling: now that exquisite morceau never found its way out of the down east country, except in the company of some man of more than one yankee power. Some years since, a fellow named Watkins took it into his head that his cara sposa was d trop, and so shortened her breath by the manual com- pression of her windpipe; most effectually put- ting out her pipe and his own at the same time, although of the last fact he was not then aware. Of course another woman had a finger in the pie. He pretended that the old lady departed this world in search of another, in somewhat of a hurry and without due notice, or the payment of  proper toll to a doctor for holding the candle and opening the door for her exit, but nevertheless in rather a quiet and lamb-like way than otherwise. In fact, "went out like a candle," as he expressed it, which, if he had introduced an extinguisher into his simile would have been quite true. No post-mortem was required to prove his guilt, for that thirst for knowledge, so particu- larly the leading characteristic of my countrywo- men, induced a critical examination of he corpse the first moment an opportunity presented itself;   MAN HU"AD COMPANY '( DAWN."   17 and besides other singular appearances, the im- press of a certain necklace of gold beads upon her neck, told the tale. The fellow was hanged; and, as during the memory of man this was the first performance of the kind ever witnessed in the county, and espe cially as the show was all open and above board, and better yet, "free, gratis, for nothing," the major part of the population of Connecticut, about half of Rhode Island, a fair representation of Massachusetts, and numerous delegates from Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, were pre- sent at the interesting ceremony, which was so managed by placing the gallows upon the height of a sidoJ, that the whole affair was plainly visible to the assembled thousands; It must have been a consolation to the poor fellow, that, although generally looked down upon all his life, he was so much looked up to at its close. It was secessary that Windham County should- show herself worthy dq the honor of receiving so large a representation of their countrymen; and accordingly, the entire military and musical force of the county was turned out It consisted of one independent company of infantry, numbering, muskets and side arms, seventeen men; one troop of light-horse, in bear-skin caps and bobtail coats; in- all, rineteea saddle-full; and for musics one- 2 8  -          \    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6605-00000011"/> CREEK AND CAMP FIRES. small drummer with three fifers for the infantry, and a trumpeter, who played on the key-bugle without using the keys, for the cavalry. On that occasion, a new air was introduced, and Mr. Watkins rattled up to the gallows in double quick, to the tune of "My Wife is Sick." ? The words, and the only ones that I ever knew to be married to this delightful morceau, are- "My wife is sick. My wife is sick. My wife is sick a bed. My wife is sick. She's always sick. I wish that she was dead." The exquisite nature of the joke, this playing of ideas upon circumstances, thus brought forcibly, palpably, and tangibly before them-so plainly indeed, that the dullest mind was enabled to grasp the entire jest in all of its magnificent de- tails, has made it in our Eastern land the most popular piece of the age. Nay, like Aaron's rod, for a long time it swallowed up all the rest; and every man, woman, and child went home from the great execution, singing, whistling, or chirping- "My wife is sick." Its popularity has not diminished by age; it has entirely superseded "Yankee Doodle," and fairly extinguished "Hail Columbia," but has never crossed the line of, the Eastern States, save in the   UNCLE BILLY.       19 company of some genuine son of the soil, as I said before." "Well, your tale has been of the longest," said Milward, "for there they come, and the per- former of your national air is certainly the most thorough-bred Yankee in all Texas; his com- panion I believe is an old friend of yours." "Old Billy Roberts, as I live," replied L , 1    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6605-00000012"/> CHAPTER II. BACKWOODBMAN AND YANKEE-A NORTHER -TiE PINEY WOODS TAVERN. "-HooPEE I boys-whar did you come from, and what are you doin' here " roared out Rob- erts, as he rode up. "Doing!" answered Milward. "Why, we got a ducking crossing that abominable creek, and thought it best to stop at this fire and dry off." "Well," replied Roberts, "you ain't the only ones that's got wet leggins and saddle-seats this mornin'; but, tell ye what, boys, ef ye hang on here long ye'll get a worse wettin' and froze up besides." "I guess--chimed in his companion-" that Mister Roberts is considerable more'n half right. If this mornin--most amazin' purty too, now ain't it--isn't a reg'lar weather breeder, then I never see one. I cal'late we'd best be a pushin' on, wet legs or dry ones, or we'll catch suthing a nation sight worse, afore we get to Malden." 20   UNCLE BILLY.       21 "Perhaps so," replied Milward; "but being nearly dry, I think we'll complete the job. By the way, Uncle Billy, where will you stop at Malden?"  "Why, whar I alters do. Don't you know I allers roost at Calder's?" answered Roberts; " and you'd best come too. -Nutmegs, here-pointing to his friend--is goin' there too, and he's the most owdacious critter to talk. I'll tell the madam we said "how d'ye" to ye on the road, and she'll keep a corner for ye to- camp down in, ef they are full; but I tell you we must marvel; so good-bye, catch up ye kin. Come along "Nutmegs.' And off he rode, followed by his Yankee friend. "Well, well," said Milward, as they rode off, "that certainly appears the most ill-matched pair you ever met. You know what a straight- forward, honest, brave-hearted old fellow Roberts is, and the other appears to be his very antithesis, but he is really a much better fellow than he seems. His name is Jared Bunce, and he claims to be a lineal descendant of his great namesake immortalized by Simms, and also some kind of a cousin to the original Sam Slick. I can't tell for the life of me whether there is any truth in these stories or not, but he has told the last so often, that "Sam Slick" is the name he is generally known by, only uncle Billy will call him "Nut-    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6605-00000013"/> 22    BACKWOODSMAN AND YANKE. megs"-referring to his native State and his for-  mer business."  "His former business; pray what was that?"I inquired. "Peddling," replied my friend, "but in' some- what of a new line. Years ago, when there was no money in circulation among farmers and stock raisers, Bunce made his appearance,'with a light wagon, loaded with all kinds of notions, which he sold right and left, at enormous prices; never asking money, but taking his pay in cows and calves, at the usual cattle-gatherings, spring and fall. A cow and calf, as you know, passed for ten dollars-and a very large drove indeed did he  get together for a mere trifle. In fact, I do not believe they really cost him one dollar for the pair. "Beside his stock of traps, he also must have brought quite a sum of money to the country, of which he spent nothing, being upon the go all the time, and living at free rack and manger among his customers, with whom he passed for a jolly fellow, always ready for any fun that might be on hand, and willing to do, not only his own share of talking and story-telling, but that of all the rest of the company." "But, ]Milward," inquired I, " surely Roberts was not mixed up with his peddling?"   UNCLE BILLY.       23 "Not at all," replied he, "but his yarn-spin- ning propensities first attracted Roberts' attention -for you know that in this respect they are con- geners; and finding out he was a much better fellow in every way than he made himself out to be-that he was shrewd in business, honest enough after his own fashion, and had quite an amount of ready cash, the old man proposed some land transactions, which succeeded, and since that time they have worked along together admirably in double harness; Roberts finding knowledge and experience in selecting and locating lands, and Bunce managing the sales, exchanges, and money matters. But if we are to be sheltered beneath the same roof with them to-night, you will hear enough from them both. Come, let's catch up and be off." "Off it is," said I, and off it was, in short order; and high time, too; for so much of the morning was already wasted, that the sun had evidently performed half his journey, while we were but commencing ours. On we pressed our horses; walking them over wet ground, and im- proving every rod of dry, with a trot. It cer- tainly was not exactly a pleasant place to be caught in by a norther, to bear its first brunt. Before us, at a distance of twelve or fourteen miles, the timber was just visible; to the left, a    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6605-00000014"/> 24    BAOXWOODSMAN AND YANKEE. broad, unbroken sea of prairie, seemingly without bounds; to the right, prairie- again, with a slight, gray border, showing where the rich bottom of the San Jacinto shot up its giant trees almost to the skies; behind us, excepting the meagre tim- ber skirting the creek, not a stick, not a tree, this side of Buffalo Bayou Woods. Having some mis- givings ourselves as to what the evening might bring forth, and a good deal of faith in Roberts' weather-wisdom, we exerted our horses to the utmost, and two o'clock found us within a mile or two of the end of our prairie road. Immedi- ately before us arose the first regular hill from the coast-a distance of eighty or ninety miles. The hill was not much of a hill certainly, but it was upland, a change of soil, and an improvement upon the desolate winter-killed prairie over which we had been travelling. While I was congratulating myself upon the prospective improvement, the voice of Milward- who was some little distance behind-called me to halt, and look to the right. There it was; plain to be seen; an inky wall sweeping on toward us with lightning speed; shutting out and veiling from our view every object behind it. "Well," said I, as Milward rode up; "well, and what now "  "Take it like men," answered he. "If we   A NORTHER.       25 have dawdled into it like fools. The timber ahead will save us some from the wind, and as to stopping at this settlement, I vote against it." "Agreed," said I, "and now to prepare for the worst." We dismounted, and having secured our blan- kets, Mexican fashion, binding us around more closely and securely than a cloak, and furnishing also a hood to draw over our heads, we re- mounted, and were scarce in our saddles when the norther struck us. No one that has not yet experienced it, or felt the effects of a West India hurricane, can realize the force of a norther's first blast. Our horses staggered, and we scarce could keep our seats. Nor was this the worst; a blinding, cutting storm of rain and sleet accompanied it. We clapped spurs to our horses, and away we dashed, through mud and through water, until we reached the creek at the foot of the timber, and which at this point divides the coast or prairie country from the upland, or oak and pine lands. The stream was full, but not stopping this time, ex- cept to throw our saddle-bags over our shoulders, we dashed in, found it not quite swimming, splashed through, and were in' the timber, and comparatively sheltered from the fierce wind,    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6605-00000015"/> 26    BACKWOODSMAN AND YANKEE. although in a farmore dangerous situation even than while on the prairie. From every quarter came the roar of the fall- ing trees-to the right-to the left-in our rear- immediately before us-sometimes obstructing our very path, and causing us to make a detour;  a shower of limbs and twigs falling continually around and upon us; but we were'in for it, and away we sped. The pace was beginning to tell upon our cat- tle, and however hard it rained out, we were forced to rein in. It was full six o'clock when we rode into the little town of Maiden, uninjured indeed by the war of elements and wreck of timber, but misera- bly cold, wet, and draggled. A roaring fire in the room appropriated to travellers-for except upon special occasions, there was but one-a par- tial change of attire, and something hot, improved matters exceedingly, and we entered the supper- room; where, besides several old friends, we found Roberts and Bunce, and received some ironical compliments upon our rate of speed, and congratulations upon our safe arrival. Supper concluded, and we returned to the trav- ellers' room, a long cabin, built of hewn pine logs, chinked and lined, with two doors, one window, without sash or glass, closed by a rude shutter,   PROVISIONS FOR T CAMPAIGN.  27 and an enormous open chimney, in which blazed a fair-sized load of wood. For furniture, four large double beds, a rude table, and a dozen or so of straight, up and-down, split-bottom, regular backwood chairs completed the inventory. Roberts and Bunce; Ricard a judge of pro- bate; Allen, a physician of the neighborhood; Wiggins, the principal storekeeper; Milward and I, were the guests. Scarcely were we seated around the huge hearth, when Roberts opened the door leading into the supper-room, and called out loudly for "Ned." "Now, Ned, my sonny," said the old man- when Ned, a jolly looking negro boy-who filled the various offices of major-domo, waiter, and ost- ler-made his appearance. "Now Ned, my sonny! you tell the madam to send us in suthin' to wood up with, this cold night. And Ned, my boy, let's hev a hull raft of wood. Here, Ned, here's suthin to brighten you up; and mind, don't forget, a plenty of both." "Ki! ole Mossa," answered the boy-" tink Ned's a fool, and neva see you afore? Why look. hea, ole mossa, mistiss done sent Rushey down to the grocery arter peach and de ole stuff, soon's neva she see you ride up. Oh, ki! de mistss    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6605-00000016"/> 28    BACKWOODSMAN AND YANKEE. sense ain't done gone yet. Mossa uncle Billy, you's been hea afore." "Thar, now clar out, and get the stuff, Ned," replied Roberts; "and don't forget that Sam Slick here'll hev a dry wizzen a heap of times afore morning. "He's the most owdacious crittur for talkin' gentlemen," continued he, addressing us--"the most owdacious crittur for talkin' you ever hearn tell on; but I reckon most on ye's heard him give tongue afore." "Well, I guess if any man can take the shine out of you, uncle Billy, 'taint me," retorted the cideant pedlar, "though I'm willin' to own up that I'm ginerally considered to rather have a gift that way myself." "Jest wait till ye get your feet in the stirrups; only wait till you strike the right kind of a trail," replied Roberts, " and ef you ain't more wind and bottom than ary hound in my pack, then - but dern my skin, ef they ain't all pretty well knowin' to your ways here." "All, I believe," said Milward, "except my friend Paxson. Paxson, this is Sam Slick Es- quire, although he signs his notes Jared Bunce- and mighty good notes they are, too, when they're signed that way."  "Now quit your pokin' fun at me, Milward; but   'WABE HAWK.       29 I'm proud to git acquainted with you, mister, though; glad to see you; been well " said Bunce -dividing his speech between my friend and my- self, and winding up with a regular pump-handle shake of my hand. "Don't you believe more than half he says," returned Milward; "and above all, Paxson, don't trade with him; he's a clever fellow and all that kind of thing, but is generally allowed to be the smartest man this side of the Sabine." "Oh, get out you," answered Bunce. "Smart men's mighty scarce, I cal'ate. I ain't made of the right kind of timber, I guess; considerable too brash; I've got my own idees about that sub- ject." "I knowed it," said Roberts; " and sence you hev got idees, let's hev 'em; jest spit 'em out."    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6605-00000017"/> CHAPTER IL. THE PEDLEB DISCOURSES UPON SMART MENp AND lAR- RATES THE AMUSING HSTORY OF JACOB ADa THa FLAT-BOAT OAPTAIN. "A RALE smart man," said the Yankee-evi- dently setting out for a yarn, " a rale smart man, now-what you call smart here, down South- ain't met with no-where much oftener'n once in a month of Sundays. You'll find plenty of men, now, that's most astonishing smart at one thing or another. There's a Mississippi gambler, you'll say he's smart at kerds; and a chap like that Col- ton-up the road apiece-and he's a most aston- ishin, A number one, superfine, double-extra judge of a horse, that's a fact,-a chap like that Colton, a rale double-dyed-in-the-wool horse-jockey, you'll say is smart in horses; but I guess it takes pretty much another sort of a chap to be a smart man- that is smart-by-itself-smart, as they used to say the alphabet when my father was about knee-high to an injin puddin'. 80   CUTE"AND  SMART."     31 "Our down-easter's is- cute enough, but that don't come up to my idees of smartness, by a jug- full. A smart iAan must be a most astonishin' keerful one, and know how to lay out the rocks that he scrapes up, so's that they'll be growin' while he's a sleepin'. I tell you, Uncle Billy, a man must not only be most amazin cute, but he must be cute enough not to show it " "In fact" said Milward, interrupting him, "he must be an universal genius, and realize what Rochfocault declared to be an impossibility, not only fm, but also plus fn que tours les autres." "Well I guess you'r more ner half right, Squire," continued Bunce. "Although I did not get the hull sense of what your friend with the Choctaw name says about it. I aint much given to talking Latin, now-a-days, though I was a most bunkum at it when I went to school, I tell you-gin'rally allowed to be the first best there was in the academy. Went through more'n half the History Sacry in one quarter, and I guess there's no tellin' how cute a lawyer or minister I'd a made if I had'nt met with an accident." An accident?" inquired Milward. 'Yes, an accident, but that ain't nothin' on earth to do with smart men-it's a chestnut horse of another color, I guess-tell you by'm bye, may    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6605-00000018"/> 32 THE PEDLER DISCOURSES UPON SMART MEN. be, but just now I'm clear behind the light-house with my subject. Afore I come here, Squire, I used to think a heap of our Yankee smartness, but I tell you, to make a rale downright go-ahead animal, there ain't nothin under the sun that can hold a candle to a backwood's edication, now that's a fact, I tell you; the necessity for relyin' entirely on himself, and distrustin' other folks, and all nicely kivered up by an open good-natur'd face, and rough off- hand obligin' ways, beats one of our college sheep-skins all to sticks. If a man don't learn to read and write quite so cute, he finds out how to meet, and how to deal with the keen chaps that he must rub against, when he goes out into the world. I guess now, Squire, that when you come acrost a rale smart man, you'll find his honesty don't keep him awake nights. He always keeps to the windard of the law, but I guess he'll sail plaguy nigh the wind. He gives his conscience a mighty free sheet, I tell you, but keep his no- tions of his duties to the world and his neighbors, most amazin' close hauled. There's Jacob B--, the financier as folks call him now-a-days, was called a most astonish- ing cute chap when he lived to York; and " cute," I guess, is about as near as men in the North ever   JACOB AND THE BANK.     33 come to bein' smart, though I tell you, some of our true blue Yankees only want a leetle enlarge- ment of idees, and a leetle opener puss and manners, to go the hull figur'. Now, as I was a sayin', Jacob was called most a mighty cute chap and no mistake, when to York. He knew how to coax a pile of dollars out of your pocket into his'n most amazin' slick, but he couldn't keep quiet about it, and as he wasn't the only cute chap down there by a few thousand, while he was a chucklin' and a shakin' his fat sides at the game he'd been playing, somebody else of his own breed would kinder sneak up, and afore you could say Jack Robinson, be off with Jacob's bone in his own mouth. When I was a boy I used to read a story about a fox, and a crow that had stole a piece of cheese. Well I guess that fable was consideble like the history of most of Jacob's operations. They do say, when he was younger, if folks trusted him right out, that he did first rate for 'em, but if they didn't, and only half trusted him, and sorter tried to hopple him, they'd a plaguy sight best let him alone, I cal'late-and when any one tried to run a cross-cut saw on him, I guess they'd best look pretty sharp for number one. He played the beatinest kind of a game with the old Fulton Bank, down to York, that ever you 3     <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6605-00000019"/> 34 THE PEDLER DISCOURSES UPON SMART MEN. hearn tell on. I guess it all come straight's a ram's horn in the eend, though. For a while he knocked the stock up and down, banged it into one corner and kicked it into another; laughed at the bank, set other folks to laughin' too, and poked all kinds of fun at it. But the old bank's a standin yet, and holds up its head among the first best, whilst Jacob found York mostly too warm a latitude, years and years ago. One day Jacob sent notice to the bank that he should want twenty-five thousand dollars in specie, and it would be called for at two o'clock. Well, he did it just a purpose to plague the bank, and the clerks all knew it, so they sent round to the other banks borrowin' all the small change they could get, and when Mr. B--  called with his porter arter the specie, there it was, all in a row of little bags, all ready, not a coin bigger'n a quarter, and mostly in ninepences, and fourpences, and dimes, and half dimes. Well, when the check was gin in, and his pile pinted out, the clerks begin to snicker, and they expected to see him in a most superfine pas- sion, but that wasn't his game; he was jest as polite as a Frenchman, and as mild as mothers' milk. He walks up to the bags, onties every one, counts 'em, figures it all down, and then he marches up to the receivin' clerk, lookin' 's if   SHARP INANCIERIN.      35 butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, and says he:- Mister, I shan't want this specie arter all. I've took a leetle but will deposit the rest, and I'll leave my man here while you jest run it over, and see that its all right. I call'ate if any man ever seen a sudden change in the shape of folks' mouths, it was just about then; it was most a superfine cute trick in Jake, and no mistake. Now, when he got to Orleans, I guess he found himself in a different latitude, and I callate it's been pretty much diamond cut diamond, ever sense. Most a powerful rough-lookin' flat-boat captain, sold him out a bargain, and cut up a most amazin' slick curlecue with him, I guess. It was about the time when dimes passed for goods, eight for a dollar; but arter the brokers got to havin' 'em made by steam; and the up-country folks used to sell out their stuff for money, take the modey and buy dimes-and then take the dimes and buy -coffee and sugar-it was a mighty cute game while it lasted, but soon run out. Now, what sot Captain Broadhorn on Jacob, 's consideble more'n I kin tell; maybe he'd been shaved so clus in that shop that the blood come, or maybe some of his friends had; any how, he    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6605-00000020"/> 80  THE PEDLER DISCOURSES UPOq SMART MEN. watched his chance when Jacob was alone in his office, and seemed to be in a pesky hurry to get away-for he was a runnin' to the door every minit, to see if some one wasn't comin' to let him off. So Captin Broadhorn seein' the sign was right, first sent a man in with a thousand dollar bill on the Canal Bank to get changed, and then walked in himself, and asked what he could buy a thousand dollars worth of dimes at? "Nine and a half to the dollar,' said Jacob. "Got 'em here?" asked the captain. "Not this minit," says Jacob, " but my son will be here in a jiffy, and he'll get 'em for you." Well, the son come back, and was sent out arter the dimes, and the minit he got 'em, the old man told him to count out to the stranger what he want- ed; and off he lined it, to see somebody or suthin' that wanted shaving consideble bad, I guess. Jacob junior counted out the dimes, and Cap- tain Broadhorn sacked 'em putty spry in his puss, which was the regular, no mistake, fashionable Mississippi pattern, made out of a Saint Louis shot bag; and when he'd got it sacked, out he put for the street. "Hold on," sings out Jacob junior, "I guess I'll take the thousand dollars, captin." "Paid the old man," says Broadhorn; "gin   BROADHOREN C PUTS OUT."   37 him a thousand dollar bill, (Canawl Bank; he put it in that dror." Well, Junior he looks, and there was the bill straight as a shingle, and out put Broadhorn in a little bigger hurry 'n old Jake was himself. I once see a the-ater play down tu York, and there was an old Jew in it, and there was a fellow run away with his daughter and his money puss; and if there ever was a critter ravin', tarrin' mad, it was this old Mister Shycock or Slycock, or whatever his name was. I never see such work as he made on it; a runnin' up and down the floor, and a pullin' at his wig, and frothin' at the mouth like a boss with the blind staggers. Now, if any of you ever see it, you kin git a pretty fair idee how old Jacob went on when he found how he was took in and done for, and what a complete rise old Broadhorn had took out of him. The police was sot to work, and sure enough they found old Broadhorn. He wan't a goin' to cut and run, not he. They got him afore the Recorder, and the two Jacobs swore like blue blazes agin him, but the captain stuck to it, he'd paid the thousand dollar bill. Arter they'd got through, pretty nigh all the flat-boatmen in Ore leens come up, and if they didn't swear strong about Broadhorn's character I guess it's a pitty. According to them, he was about fifty per cent.    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6605-00000021"/> O8  TH PEDLER DISCOURSES P.:ON SMART MEN. honester than any other man in llinoise, and equal to about four preachers and a half. He could drive a nail at sixty yards, drink more whis- key than any other man on the river, and be so- berer arter he'd got it down than anybody else that never see a drop in their lives. He could out-fiddle all created beins, out-jump a wild-boss, whip seven times his own weight in any kind of animated natur'; and it was hard to find what he  hadn't done or couldn't do, exceptin' to take dimes without payin' for 'em. Well, they made him out to be a most superfine kind of a hard-fisted angel without wings.  The judge said, that there wasn't much testi. mony to be relied on; that it depended more on character and veracity; that the stranger had proven his'n pretty clear; that Mr. B:'s was well known, and didn't want provin'-(and here, I tell you, old Baldwin, he was'recorder then, grinned) -and that he rather thought he must give it agin Mister B. I guess sometimes 'tain't so clever to have a character arter all; and I'm consideble certain that there is such a thing as bein' a little too amazin' smart. Or   CHAPTER IV. BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE-THE WRONG INN, AND A HARD CUSTOMER. BUNCE having, at this period of his discourse, paused to refresh himself with a moderate glass of the "red-eye," and after his thirst was allayed, producing half a plug of cavendish, and proceed- ing to slice off a bit as large as a hickory-nut, for immediate consumption, Uncle Billy determined to improve the opportunity, and make an attempt to "( get even," as he would have expressed it.  "Tell ye what, gentlemen, I rayther reckon "Wooden Nutmegs" thar ain't shootin' quite so wide of the centre, in his preachment about smart men, and them that's too consarned smart. "Bein' too smart's a kind of an ailment, and I allow we must all on us catch it oncet, just like the measles or the chicken-pox.

Now, this " bein' too smart" has a heap of rammi- fication-as the man said about his six-shooter-- and one on em, and the biggest chunk of a hog in the hull drove, by a long shot, is "barkim up the  urong tree," leastways that's how we baptize it.  "Nutmegs" thar, he'd call it" "shooti7' yer granny," and it's pretty much knowed in the white settle- ments as "finding a mar's neest ;" but hit's all the same I reckon in the long run. Thar's some folks now that's a leetle too smart to live on this yearth--t'ain't over safe to let 'em go round alone, and I allow when I war a'groin' up, that I war one on 'em. Ivry one knows me, or a smart chance of 'em do-for that jofired Stray Yankee went and put me down in the book, he writ, name and all-just as piert as a puppy, and I ain't the ondly one, nither, that he sarved out; but, as I wer a sayin', evry one knows that I wer raised in old Tennessee, then toted off to Alabam, and settled on the Warrior, and then put out for Texas. Now, when I moved to a new county I got my consate took out of me, I tell ye; but somehow or 'nother, I sorter fancied a piece ago, that   UNCLE BILLY AT WASHNGTON,   41 nothin' would do but I must go to Washington, and see Mr. Polk augerated. I'd made a big crap and hed a smart chance of the rocks in my old shot-bag, and I hed bisness ; to see too, though I might hev got that put through a heap cheaper if I'd staid on the plan- tation. Well, one fine mornin' my bills war up for the white settlements, and off I put; rid down to Houston; found a little one-horse boat a going to the Island, and then took the shute for Orleans. So on I went to Mobile, up the Warrior to my old stampin' ground, up agin to the old State, and arter spendin' a week or so among my kin, made a bee-line for Washington. Some how, when I come to get back agin among white folks, and to see thar queer ways, my old smartness sorter broke out agin. Well, I got to Washington without runnin' afoul of ary snag, and me and a friend that wer along, set out to find a place whar we could get to stay. I tell you, gentlemen, ef the city warn't bilin' over, that's no mistake. -Ivry hotel war full of strangers, and it took so long to hunt up a roostin' place, that I'm "dog on" ef I hadn't half a mind to try campin' out. Hows'ever we found what we wanted arter a    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6605-00000023"/> 42    BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE. piece, got fed, and then put out to hunt up some men that we reckoned war in town. My friend wanted to pick up a nigger to pilot us about the streets, but I was too jofired smart for that. Ses I, " do ye think a feller that kin find his way in ary timber without a compass, and across the perara, without ary trail, wants a man to show him up and down sech trails as what is in this settlement? Jest look at the lamps; why its a rale blazed road and no mistake. Out we put, and afore long fetched up to a big buildin' that had a place down stairs with a counter in it like a hotel bar. In we went; my friend walked back whar some men war standin', to inquire, and I took hold of a big book that war layin' on the counter, and turned it. round to look at the boarders' names. Jest as I got it square afore me, an audacious piert lookin' chap that wer standin' behind the bar, catches hold of the book and sings out "( Hallo! who the blazes are ye, and what are ye doing with our ledger?" "Ledger," says I, " ain't that your register?" "Register!" says he, " whar in thunder do ye think ye are?" "Are?" say I, a beginin' to feel squally. "Are! why in a hotel, to be shurd."

Gentlemen, ef any of ye war ever catched stealin' coppers outen them preambulatin' beggin' boxes that goes round the meetins, then ye can appreciate my feelins. We walked out quiet and docious, give a darkey a quarter to show us home, and marvelled off with our tails atween our legs. But I rayther reckon that this warnt the fust ner the last time that I've been catched a barkin' up the wrong-tree. Thar wer a chap that I tried to run'a saw on here in Texas, a while ago, I won't forget in a hurry. I war a travellin' from the Brazos to the Trinity, and when I got to the Atascasete crossin', I found the San Jacinto a roarin' and a hummin' it: hit was a cotin' it, "hark from the tombs." Free soil movements was a goin' on, and trees a tumblin' in all along the banks. I see thar wer no help for it, so I took my feet outen the stirrups, threw my saddle-bags over my shoulder, and in me and the mar went. We war in a awful tight place for a time, but    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6605-00000024"/> "THE PEDLER DISCOURSES UPON SMART MEN. we soon landed safe. I'd jest got my critter tied out, and a fire started to dry myself with-- for I wer powerful skeart about the fever-when I see a chap come a ridin' up the hill on a smart chunk of a poney. His little red eyes war stuck in his head like a pig's, his whiskers wer power- ful and no mistake, for ef thar hadn't been sile enough in his fat chops to hev raised the crap, thar wer a plenty outside. A little red nose wer jest risin' outen the whiskers like a bit of the sun in a fog, or a red- bird in a huckleberry patch. He war a member of the no-comb society, and belonged to the anti- razor 'sociation, and ef he could ondly hev swum the river with his head in the water, instead of his feet it would hev made a most amazin' im- provement in his personal appearance. Thar war no doubt of it, he war one of 'em. "Hoopee  stranger"-sings out my beauty- "How d'ye? Kept your fireworks dry, eh? How in thunder did ye get over?" "Oh!" says I, "mighty easy. Ye see, stran- ger, I'm powerful on a pirogue; so I waited 'till I see a big log a driftin' nigh the shore, when I fas- ten'd to it, set my critter a straddle on it, got into the saddle, paddled over with the saddle-bags, and steered with the mare's tail."

"Stranger," says I, ye'r just one huckle-berry above my persimmon; 'light and take some 'red- eye.' 'I thought ye looked green, but I wer "barkin' up the wrong tree."

I war at New/Orleens oncet, setting in my marchant's store, when he called out fer his man. "Teddy," says he, "did you ever tare lard?"    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6605-00000025"/> "THE PEDLER DISCOURSES UPON SMART MEN. "Indade and I've done that same, sir, time and agin, sir," says Teddy.

Off goes Teddy, as piert as kin be, and in not more nor half an hour back he comes, and pokes his head in the countin' room. "Why, Teddy," says my friend, "I sent you down to tare that lard half an hour ago. What in thunder sent you back agin?" "It's done, sir," says Ted, with a knowin' wink. "Done! Ten barrels of lard tared in half an hour. What do you mean, you scoundrel?" says my friend, getting his back up. "Indade and indade I have sir," says Teddy.

When he'd sorter pacified his feelins, and got more docious, he turns round to me, and says: "What do you suppose I discharged my last porter fer, Uncle Billy?" "I'd be barkin on a powerful blind trail, ef I should try to tree that coon," says I. "Well," says he, " a miller at Saint Louis sent me down a hundred barrels of a new brand of flour--bang up, too-and wanted I should try the market with it. When it arrived, the weather was very bad, and I got it in the store, and had it hoisted up in the lofts. The next day I called Pat.  "Where did you put that new brand of flour?" said I. "Third flure, Sir," answered he. "Send down fifty barrels, have it inspected and then send it back again," said I. "I'll do that same!" says Pat-and he did.

"Indade and I have sir-and warn't it your. self that tould me to send it back again?" answered Pat as cool as a cucumber. And so it was. "Ef," concluded uncle Billy, "a medal for over smartness is ever struck-I'm for givin' it to the Irishers."   CHAPTER V. I A SLIUo HAS THE FLOOR-SERVING OUT A LAND- "ORD-HOW TO MAKE Ai RAISE. WHETHER Mr. Roberts intended to put a period to his discourse at this particular moment, or not, as an accurate historian I cannot say; but cer- tainly he paused; and Bunce, who had evidently been watching for an opportunity, seized thb innings-were they rightfully his own or not. Having, as usual, cleared the ship for acti n, he commenced. "Now , UnTcle Billy, I kinder guess if youi ras at a meetin', and the preacher should stop to take a drink of water-I won't say they put anything stronger in-or to blow his nose, or to wipe hit eyes, ef he's considable affected, and's a preachin' a wimmin's sarmon, I cal'late if you could only see sich a chance, you'd up and give the preacher and the meetiners ginerally your idees aiid views on the 6iibject. 4              49    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6605-00000027"/> 50     SAM SLICK HAS THE FLOOR. You see I only held up a minnit, to git breath, and in you broke, jest's if I'd got through my stage and put up my horses, when I'd only stop- ped 'em on the top of a hill, to get their wind. I havn't got anything aginst you, Uncle Billy; me and you's the best kind of friends, but consarn my pickter if you didn't choke me off, in a leetle the slickest story-a most dreadful funny circum- stance-when you shoved your oar in, then it's no matter-that's all." Here the pedler evidently had the old man at disadvantage, for the latter having commenced operations upon an inch square of cavendish, was so particularly occupied in reducing it to a proper consistence for easy mastication, that speaking was a provisional impossibility. So he contented himself with shaking his fist at Bunce, and sha- ping his mouth as near the fashion of a grin as its peculiar situation would authorize with safety, while the rest of us begged Mr. Bunce to go on with his yarn. "Well, gentlemen," continued he, "I hadn't half got through with my smart folks yet, when Uncle Billy jumps up with his amendment, when I had the floor." (Anotherfist from Uncle Billy.) "I was jest agoin' to tell you one of the cutest dodges that I ever hearn tell on-for it didn't hap- pen to me, but I hearn or read on it somewhae. c!    i'   DONE AND DONE.       51 I guess there ain't many of you here that's trav- elled much in the Southern States, but what's lit on a poor, poverty-struck, ager-shook, tumble- down, head-over-heels, goin'-to-the d--l-starn-fore- most place called Camden, about thirty miles from that rale scrumptious, thrivin' town, Columby; and if any of you ever had the misfortin to stop at a tavern, thinkin' to get dinner-'specially in the old stagin' times-or tried to sleep a night thare, I guess you'll remember it. There was a stage full of passengers comin' this way; and some one of 'em said to another, that "' they were only five miles from Camden." "Pesky glad to hear it," said a Yankee-lookin' chap; "pesky glad to hear it; I'm as hungry as a dog." "Sorry for you, then"-says the man;-." so am I; but you won't get three mouthfulls down, afore up comes the stage. It's an old trick at the house." "Trick or no trick," says the Yankee, "I'll have a hearty dinner." "If you do you'll lose your seat in the stage," answered the other. "I'll bet you supper for the hull six on us," says Yankee, "that I do get my dinner, and that I don't lose my seat." "I'll take that bet," says t'other, "and put in    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6605-00000028"/> fi2    SAM SLICK HAS THE FLOOR. wine and cigars too; for we'll be at Columby to supper, and they ive there." When they got to Camden, the dinner wasn't ready, and when it was, a man stood at the room door, and taxed 'em four bits apiece when they went in; but they didn't get four bits apiece down their throats afore in comes the tavern. keeper, and tells 'em the stage is ready, mail behind time, and the driver wouldn't wait a minit for his grandmother; and sure enough, up druv the stage right aginst the window, and the driver begun blowin' his horn a plaguy sight harder 'n Joshua blew his afore Jericho. Away went the travellers, tight as they could lick it, at least all of 'em but the Yankee; and there he sot, peggin' away for dear life, and ma- kin' the vittles walk down his throat most amazin' fast. "You'll lose your seat, sir," said the tavern- keeper. "Don't keer a dan," said the Yankee, "I guess I wont my diner." So he sot to work agin, and began on a turkey that no one had time to touch, but he got four bits worth out of it afore you could say Jack Robinson. "And now mister," says he, "I guess I'll take a bowl of bread and milk-to top off with."   A BADSELL.        3 The man went out of the room, and presently come back and sot the bowl of milk down afore his customer. "Well, mister," says the Yankee, "I guess I'll take a spoon to eat this ere truck with; can't eat bread and milk with my fingers." "Spoon, sir " says the man--his eyes sticken out of his head. "Spoon, sir! There was a dozen of 'em on the table; rale silver, too." "Well, s'posin' there was," replied the Yankee, "You don't s'pose them chaps was agoin' to pay fifty cents ahead, and carry nothin' away to show for it, do ye?" "Thunder and lightning!" roared out the man. "If I don't bring the whole bilin' of 'em to justice there's no snakes in Virginny." Half an hour after, up come the same stage, rattlety-bang, and in jumped the Yankee among the passengers. "Hold on! hold on! stranger," sung out the tavern-keeper-comin' up to the stage with the sheriff; and a hull crowd; some to help take the robbers, and some to see the fun. "Hold on. Now jest pint out the chaps that took them spoons, will ye?" "Well, mister," drawled out the Yankee, "I guess if you'll only look in your coffee-pot, I cal'. late you'll find your spoons.

Away druv the stage; the driver cussin', the passengers roarin' with laughter, the crowd a yellin', and the tavern-keeper jest jumpin' right up and down, as mad's a hornet. "Well," contiued Bunce, as soon as our laugh- ter had subsided, "that was pretty considerable cute, a most a powerful smart rise, I guess; but I'll tell you about a man who was so monstrous smart that they do say he never missed fire, ner had the wind took out of his sails in his life. I guess you've all on ye hearn tell of old Wade Hampton, his crowds of niggers, hundreds of race- horses, and hull counties of land. Well, he made every dollar of it; wasn't worth a Bungtown cop- per when he set up for himself, and most all his work was head-work; didn't dirty his hands much I cal'late. When he was a growin' up, he saw the chance there was a goin' to be in wild land, and 'stead of makin' a lawyer of himself, and larnin' to set folks by the ears, or studyin' docterin', and how to trot his saddle-bags through thar bodies; or gettin' made a preacher of, to cobble up their souls, practisin' on soft-sawder and human natur, as Cousin Sam tells on--eatin' fried chickens, and finally marryin' some rich man's darter, and set- tlin' down to roost-instead of any of these, he   IA0 5ASURVEY AND A HALF.        55 larnt surveyin', and I guess he must have took a few lessons of " seven-up" as he went along, for there never was a black-leg on the Mississippi that could hold a candle to him, nor a faro-bank to Orleens that made the first dollar out of him. Well, he larnt surveyin' and by the day his time was out, and he was his own man, his sharp ways has caught the eyes of more than one, who wanted jest such tools to work with. One day a man called on him; he and others with him owned a most amazin' sight of wild land--all pine bar- ren, not worth a bad fourpence the hull on't; but  he wanted Hampton to survey it, and to survey it so 'twould sell. He took the hint, for he'd been promised the biggest kind of wages if he did his work up right. Well, he surveyed the hull on't, cut it into all sorts of curus shapes, and made lots of all sizes, but always managed to corner on a white-oak, or else a hickory or wild peach-and never saidpine once in his field notes. The owners put their lands in the market for sale, and got rid of 'em pretty quick, and the sur- veyor got a check for five thousand, with the ad- vice and condition that he should cut stick directly, as it mightn't have been good for his constitution to have stayed in that climit arter the purchasers found out what kind of surveys he'd been a ma- kin'. So Wade come south, and from that minit.    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6605-00000030"/> 56    sAM SLICK HAf THE FLOOR. never made a miss lick; the chips was sure t come when he put his axe in.. Once he'd been to the Augusty races; took his horses clear on there with him, and made a most astonishin' heap of money; well, when he got to Montgomery, on the way home, the gamblers there thought he'd got more'n his share, and so picked out three of their top sawyers, that Wade didn't know, clubbed together, and made up a puss of ten thousand dollars, for 'em to go down the river with him, and get a game. Well, they got a game, and a pretty game it was, too. I guess maybe some of you've hearn of it-they call it poker-and they played it, all three goin' agin him onderhanded; but old Wade had the rocks, and old Wade had the pluck to back 'em up -with; and when the four gentlemen got to Mobile there wasn't but one of 'em had a dollar in his pocket, aud that was Ginral Hampton. When they parted, says he, "gentlem:, here's a small roll of bills to pay your passage up and give you a stake; and when you kin raise a puss that's an object, don't be modest, but let me know, and I'll give you a chance as long a8 your rocks hold out; and if any of your friends here'd like to try, I'm goin' over the lake to-night, and am perfectly open for a game." But the gentlemen had got quite enough, and   GOING  BLIND.      $7 went off home, cussin' their luck, but swearih' that old Wade was a trump after all. The greatest rise I ever heard of the old Gin- ral's, was among them faro banks to Orleens, Afore the lawr took hold of 'em they played for any amount, and were owned by the richest folks in town. The Ginral went in one night with a shot-pouch full of-money in his hand, and turns to the dealer. Kin I bet this jest so?" says he-" too much trouble to count, and I ain't got time for only one lick." "Certinly, Ginral, certainly. Anything you please.", Down went the shot-pouch in the pot, and the next turn, up come a Jack, and the old man won. "How much, Ginral?" says the dealer. Pour it out, and let's count it." Hampton takes the pouch by the bottom, and out comes a pile of dollars-and that wasn't all--? there was a small roll of the biggest kind of bank- bills come out too. "How much " says the dealer to one of his folks, who was a countin' the pile. "Hundred and fifty Mexicans, three thousand in bills," says he. The dealer looked over, never said a word, but he gin a kind of look out of the corner of his eyes    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6605-00000031"/> 58     SAM SLICK HAS THE FLOOR. as much as to say, "I smell suthin', but I can't  tell what."  These bills now was fasten'd to the bag by a pin, and when the Ginral shuk out the Mexicans,  he pulled out the pin, and down they all come in  a heap. If he'd have lost, I kinder guess the dol- lars would have come out alone, and not in quite  so good company. Now, I don't know as I ever met with, or knew of any one as smart all over, as the old Ginral;  but there's a man in Texas-and I guess he's  mighty nigh top of the heap, as far as property goes-that would have made a mate for him, if he'd had any edication to have started on; but he hadn't. Never went anywhere, nor larn't any- thing but horse and cow, and if he don't know them it's a pity. I wish I may be biled for a doughnut if they don't say he salts away his dol lars in barrels, and plants 'em in the ground. Guess I could larn him how to make 'em sprout and bear a crop without that-couldn't you Uncle Billy?" "Well, but Mr. Bunce," I inquired, "if he buries his money in the ground, how do you know so much about the extent of his wealth?" "I guess there's enough left outside to show. Why I cal'late he's more stock than any five men in the 'varsal world; a heap more than Job ever   STICK TO YOUR OWN TOBACCO.   59 had; though I guess he couldn't shine when you come to count up the camels.

"Come, Uncle Billy," said Bunce, producing his piece of cavendish, "I've got suthin' here bang up, A number one, first best, I tell ye. Don't be so darned sot up about your tobacco; try mine, and pass it round." "No, sonny," answered Roberts. "Mighty apt to be good ef you say so; but I'm fer allers fol- lerin' the same trail.

"EvRY marn chaw his own tobaokker," said Uncle Billy, removing something less than a quarter of a pound of the masticated article from his mouth. "Every man chaw his own tobackc ker; that's my sentiments; and it ain't bad ad. vice, ef Uncle Billy does give it. I larnt suthin' oncet, from a new settler, who located hisself down in our Neck-of-the-Woods. He war one of your countrymen "Nutmegs,"- but that didn't make the lesson ary bit the worse. T'want nuthin' new, prehaps; mout be you've got wind of it afore; but it jest fixed my frizen perzackly. I'd asked him a question about suthin' that con- sarned him, but didn't consarn me by a long shot, and the answer I got, I ain't forgot yet.

He war one of your helpin' chaps, allers a doin' suthin for other peo- ple and a lettin' his shop keep itself; which- seein's the biggest eend of his drygoods war red- eye and old peach, didn't more nor half pay.

Mobile wasn't big enough for him to buy lick- ers in long, and so he must take the shute for Orleens, just to see what the settlers war a doin' thar, and to lay in a raft of drinkables.

Oncet, when I war a crossin the Gulf with him, I see suthin' he war a thinkin' on, had come across him mighty quare; and so says Ij "old man, what trail 's that ye 're a barkin' on all alone to yourself?" "Why, Uncle Billy," says he, "suthin sot me to thinkin' of a chap I carried over to Orleens last year, that come up with me a few-I tell you." Says I, " old man, if any man iver got the lead of you, I'm powerful curus to hear all about it."

"I tell ye, Uncle Billy, I walked off; and I niver see that chap sence but what I give him an invite to fire up.

We war jest out- side of Galveston, the water as smooth as a pera- ra, and we war a humpin' it like a quarter boss.

At last he crossed over, and walked alongside of me up and down, quite docius, but I could hear him a grumblin away to hisself. Finally, says he, "Uncle Billy, I'm powerful mad; made a dern fool of myself, and rayther reckon we're mighty apt to get into a owdacious bad scrape. "Don't believe it," says I. "I'll go it blind on your luck captin; bet my hull pile on it, every bit as sure as four aces."

The lower cabin passengers war mostly asleep, and didn't get wind of it; but the upper saloon had a lot of Jews and sich chaps, from Houston and Galveston; only old Cunnel Fontleroy camped down thar. Now the boat hadn't been anchored five minits afore thar war a mighty fus ris up. They war up and a stirrin I tell you; they called a meetin', and they made chairmin and secketaries, and passed resolutions, and made pretickelar Judies of they- selves ginerally. The hull thing come to this, when it war ciphered up, and the answer sot down. Two weeks afore the old 'New York' got cotched by a norther, come to anchor in the same place, suthin went wrong, and the next day down she went, drownin a raft of men; and so our meetiners wanted to know how the captin dard to foller in the same track. Well, the resolutions war made, and carried, and signed; but no man could be scared up to hand 'em to the captin. Some of 'em knew him, and the rest of the drove had hean tell of his E ; it',   AN AtMAiE ' NDiIDUAL,.   69 ways. At last some smart chap thought of the Cunnel, and so a committee war 'pinted to wake him up. Old Fontleroy war on his way home from San Antone, whar he'd ben sorter dry-nursin' Uncle Sam's green troops. He war naterally good- humored as a she bar when her cubs is meddled with; but, bein' sent out among the fleas and Mexicans, and gettin' the ager so powerful that it fairly shuk him outen the country at last, had improved the nateral beauties of his disposition powerfully. lThe committee havin' tried speakin' without wakenin him, one on 'em jeest shuk him a-mite, and up he jumped, and with a shootin' iron in his hand, and looked round the crowd to see which one he'd best drap first. The committee resigned in a hurry, and mixed theyselves up with their feller citizens in less than no time, thinkin' they'd woke up a uglier customer than old Wright hisself.

THE JUDGE'S STORY.-THE WRONG BOTTLE--A LEGEND OF LITTLE CREEK.  's I SUPPOSE, Mr. Roberts," said Judge Ricord, it "that you only lay that down as a general princi- ple, and would scarcely refuse a chew from a  stranger, if you needed one. I know you would pull out your own tobacco-pouch for friend or  stranger with as much pleasure as for yourself.  Judging from these premises, I presume that you  refused our friend Slick's tobacco for no other  purpose than to make a text, with which both to  point a moral and adorn a series of tales, for which,  by the way, we are much obliged to you."    of "Now see heah, Judge," replied Uncle Billy,  "ye're allers judgin', and I shouldn't wonder if t you presumed a smart chaince too-that's your  business. I wear plain home-made, cut to keep  a my legs warm; and, when I'm on the plantation,  a huntin' shirt; but ye never catch me adornin li " \   FRED KEISLER.  my tale, as ye call it; when I do, and git on one of them dern fool, no 'count, sharp pinted, split up behind things, that you've got on yer back, ye may jest advertise that yer uncle's done sold his senses out, and that thar's a head to be let cheap. "Pshaw, Uncle Billy," replied the Judge, s you're a mighty hard nut to crack a joke on. I wanted to give another illustration of the gene- ral principle that you have laid down, only it would be a little more apposite perhaps, to alter it to " let every man drink from his own bottle." "Uncle Billy seconds the 'mendment," inter- rupted that person. Most of you, I believe," continued the Judge, 'know Fred Kreisler. Years since, when he came here from the army, he was poorer than any church mouse, and did not seem to have the least idea of taking care of himself. It was quite evi- lent that he had been brought up as a gentleman, md had received the education of one. So a few )f us took him in hand, and found him employ- ment in the County Clerk's office, and sometimes he District Clerk's. Fred was honest as the day, md as generous as the sun; could be trusted with Anything in the world except a bottle of whiskey; )ut that was his stumbling-block. In fact, he ived altogether too near the grocery, and' was, ,i-r    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6605-00000039"/> 74       THE WRONG BOTTLE. according to all appearance, going to the deuce stern foremost. In the very nick of time, an old Dutchman who lived on the little prairie, about four miles from town, took it into his head to die, and left a young wife with quite a respectable property, but help less as a child; for the poor thing couldn't even speak a word of our language. Now you will perceive, that those of us with any charity to spare, had two cases on hand that called for our immediate attention-Fred Kreis. ler and Hans Strobel's widow; and after duly con- sidering the premises, we concluded that it would be better to put them together, and make but one case of the two. The widow jumped at the chance of getting a smart fellow, who would make her a good husband, if he didn't visit town too often; and Fred was glad to get a home, a good- natured and good-looking vrow, and become, as it were, a man of some property and consideration. Things went on well for a time.; but Fred, al. though anything but lazy, could not and would not work on the farm; and so, for the sake of em- ployment, came to town every Saturday, and took out work enough to copy, to keep him busy until Saturday rolled around again. Saturday, however, was the very worst day that poor Fred could have selected; for you all know   THE TW BOTTLES.      75 it is our weekly saturnalia, when all the idle fellows, picayune gamblers, petty horse-jockeys, men of some little character, and men of none at all, in this part of the country, assemble, fill the groceries and empty their ppckets. Fred was fond of any kind of society; preferred good if he could get it; but was not very squeamish, so took up with the best that offered, and as he drew his pay for writing weekly, found no trouble in obtaining companions to help him get rid of it. We talked- to him seriously, and at last told him that unless he went home sober, we could not trust him with important papers to carry off with him. One bitter cold day Fred came to town full of a new-born resolution. H'e did not intend to pass the day without enjoying himself, but he did, to carry home with him a bottle of whiskey so well drugged with tartar-emetic that he should never want to see a glass of " red-eye" again. He got through his regular business-a part of which consisted in getting pretty thoroughly fuddled- procured a bottle of whiskey, pure, and a second wofully spiced; managed somehow to crawl on the back of his old mare, and set forth-the spi- ced bottle of whiskey being in the right hand pocket of his saddle-bags, and the Simon Pure on the left    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6605-00000040"/> (:0      THE WRONG BOTTLE. The boys about had noticed this arrangement, and after Fred was fairly mounted, some of them insisted that he should dismount and take a part. ing drink-an invitation it was not in his nature to refuse. So off he crawled, and while in the grocery, some one shifted the saddle-bags, end for end. Fred got under way again, at last, and seems to have met with no accident until he arrived at Lit- tle Creek, about a mile from town, on his home. ward route. Now, Little Creek, as you know, is in ordinary times a small shallow stream of clear water, with a monstrous bed, and between high banks; very like a large man with a small soul. On special occasions, however, it' can get up in a hurry, and fill its banks to overflowing. In the centre of the stream, at the crossing, is a large log, the upper surface two feet at least out of the water at ordinary times; upon which it is convenient for the traveller to alight, and relieve his horse of his weight while the animal is drinking. It was Fred's fortune, on descending the steep bank, to find two of his prairie neighbors standing on this log, and allowing their horses to rest and quench their thirst. Of course, Fred's horse must drink, and equally of course his master must imitate the example,   FREE PHYSIO.       " although in a different element. So Fred alighted on the log, and pulling out the bottle from the left side of his saddle-bags, offered it to his friends-who took a right hearty swig-and then drank himself. Fred's tongue was pretty thoroughly oiled, and in relating the news he had picked up in town, detained his friends until they were quite ready for another dram. Then ensued more conversa- tion-for it is a serious violation of country eti- quette to drink and run. At last they prepared for a start; but now nothing would serve Fred except a parting drink, which was not declined. By this time the bottle was half gone, and Fred's friends half seas over; as for himself, he had crossed the line long ago. I have said that it was bitter cold; in fact, the se- cond day of a norther. We had had a violent rain during part of the previous day and all the suc- ceeding night, and the creek was on the rise. About half an hour after sunset I was at old Webb's, two miles beyond the creek, and about starting for town, when a horse that had been ridden off by Webb's son, returned without a rider. The old man, somewhat alarmed, mounted the animal, and accompanied me towards town. We called upon his nearest neighbor on our    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6605-00000041"/> 78      TH WRONG BOTTLE. road, and learnt that he had accompanied young Webb, and that his horse also had just returned riderless. We were now pretty certain that something had happened; and on arriving at Kreisler's, and finding his old mare at the field fence, roaming about and feeding, with saddle on, and the broken reins of a bridle dangling at her feet, I must confess that I became alarmed my. self; and causing Fred's negro boy to mount the mare, we sent him back for the returned horse, at the last house, and ordered him to lead the ani. mal, and follow us towards town as soon as he could. We met no one upon the road, and neither heard nor saw anything of the missing men until we arrived at the creek; but when we rode down the bank, there sat upon the old log our three men; and perhaps the most pitiable objects that ever yet were seen. They had finished the bot  tie, and it is a wonder that it had not finished them. The water had mounted up to their waists, and there they sat astraddle of the log, helpless, and making the most woful noises. Intoxication and nausea had come on together; and, as Webb afterwards declared, nothing prevented them from throwing up their boots, but the fact that these articles were firmly planted in the mud.   FIGHTS C"CONSTANTLY ON HAND."  79 We dragged the poor fellows out, helpless and miserable, placed them on their horses like so many sacks, and walking by their side, managed to hold them on until we got to the nearest house; then had them put into a warm bed, and by next morning all were pretty bright. The story, however, soon got wind; but in the place of executing summary vengeance upon the grocery-man, for selling bad whiskey, Kreisler's friends transferred their threats to him, and for weeks he found it convenient to absent himself. At last, mutual friends patched the matter up. One good effect was produced, the trio had quite enough of whiskey for life; and one bad one, for the least hint about the affair, in the presence of either, will bring on a fight as quick as you could drop your hat. Now, Uncle Billy, I hope the moral of my text is sufficiently apparent." "Sartin, clar as mud," said Uncle Billy. "Don't drink every man's whiskey you meet on the road, 'specially in the middle of a risin' creek."    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6605-00000042"/> CHAPTER VIII. SAD EFFECTS OF NUTMEG, AND A WONDERFUL GAME O0 POKER. "BT I tell ye, Judge," continued Uncle Billy, "hit's a blessin' them chaps knew what bit 'em; 't ain't every day that men's so wise. I got onto a boat oncet at Nachitoches, and the first man I sot eyes on war a little, long, thin, old, shrivel-face, dried-up, coast Frenchman. He war a settin' in the social hall when I went aboard, and looked just's if he'd swaller'd a rail, and shrunk to it. He must iev had a holler some- whar in his legs to cache all the pervisions he tuk in; for ef you could ondly hev seed him at the table, you'd hev sot him down fer a nateral phe- losopher a tryin' a series of speriments, to find out how much a man would hold. Well, as I war sayin', this chap war the first man I took notice on. He and three others were a playin' uker, and a goin' it in on the groceries with a perfect looseness. 80   FAVORABLE OPERATION OF GROCERIES.  81 Iv'ry little while they'd yell out "uker," and then all hands fired up, tell afore midnight they war all rayther above par; and I reckon when they toted the old one off to bed and rolled him in, he didn't know whether he war in his berth er in his infancy. I war a stirrin' mighty soon next mornin' and no wonder, fer the boat war so full that I had to camp down on the biler deck, and long afore sun- up I see old Frenchy a thunderin' round to get the bar-keeper started. Thinks I, "old stud, ef you'd any idee last night how dry you'd a been this mornin', you'd hev tuk a small sprinklin' more afore ye vamosed." He looked mighty like the gin-cocktail the bar- keeper mixed up fer him, and that war down in the mouth, in three shakes of a dog's tail, by the watch; then tuk another to keep that straight, and 't warn't long afore the groceries begin to oparate. "Musber Barkeep," says he, "you sall hev ze bontay to tell$ me vat make me so so--no, sow; vat you call heem--eps-up, ear-a-sore, how you call heem, lass night?-aah ha!" "Well, sir, I reckon it mought be the brandy."

"Oh, ef it warn't the brandy it mought hev been the sugar. Sweetnin' in lickers is mighty onholsum." 'Oh no, Musher; I make ze sucre mineself, and it not tostify pairsonne-no nevair, Jamay." "Oh, very well sir; you know best. Suppose we call it the water, then; hit's oncommon movin' to strangers in these parts." "Va-at, ze watair? No, no, NO, Musher.

Thar'd be a heap of fun, now Judge, in playin' keerds, ef you could only win all along; but some- how a nuther, ef ye try it, ye're pretty sure to get yer pile raked down afore ye quit. Ef ye're a fitin' the tiger, ye may swar ye'll get scratched tell the blood comes; ef ye try poker, 'twon't be long afore ye're a buttin' yer head agin four white aces, and with four kings in yer own hand, prehaps; for them no 'count chaps that foiler poker for a livin' is mighty apt to wring in a cold deck, ef they can't stock the one ye're a playin' with; and if ye're sot down to uker, a playin' for fun and whiskey, all hands is mighty apt to get ukered in the eend.

"Now, Ike," says he, "what iver ye do, don't hev nuthin' to say to that new game they've skeart up down thar, whar the Jack takes the ace; don't    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6605-00000044"/> 84=     SAD EFFECTS OF NUTMEG. ye tech it; hit's clear agin nater.

I see a mighty funny poker game oncet on the Massasip, a goin' up from Orleens.  Thar war four old coast Frenchmen, all sugar. planters, just sold thar crap and got thar pockets  full of rocks. They went it strong, I tell ye. They'd got their backs and tails both up. Captain ! Whiskey had got a powerful grip on 'em, and ef they warn't a humpin it, "hark from  the toombs." At last they went to the bar, to stretch thar legs and wood-up; and while they war gone I see a mischievious lookin' chap a changin' thar papers. "Keep shady," says he, a winkin' to us that were standin' round the table, "and you'll see the old boy riz directly." Back come the old chaps, the keerds war dealt round, and I see thar eyes a snappin', but all a tryin' to look powerful solemn. A " blind" war bet, and up spoke the next hand.

Oh ginger such a shellin' out as thar war to be shua; and when the dimes run dry, they drawed drafts on Orleens, and give notes tell they'd bet all they war worth, and when the hand was called, ivry man Jack slaps down four white aces, and dove fer the pile; and sech a yellin' and cursin', and sackrayin' as thar war when they diskivered how they'd been sold. The deck on the table were all aces, and as it were half deck poker they were playin', ivry man got five aces, and thinkin' another ace had crawled into the pack somehow, they all cached one, and kept the others. One run fer his pistols, another pulls out his knife, and ef they'd ondly diskivered who sarved em out, thar'd a been a mighty small chaince for him; but they went on so that the captin had to interfere, and shut 'em up.    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6605-00000045"/> CHAPTER IX. THE LAWYER S STORY-COLONIZING DEAD MAN'S ISLAND-A TALE OF THE MURRELL TIMES. "YOUR story, Mr. Roberts," said Milward, "brings to my mind a strange transaction that I witnessed upon the same river. It was not very long after the crusade against professional gamblers had been prosecuted so vigorously in all the lower towns, and the scamps no longer carried so high a hand as they had done. It was not over safe to attract the attention of officers or passengers by plucking their pigeons too incau- tiously, except perhaps upon such boats as were owned by gamblers, of which indeed there were more than one. I was descending the river in the old Thun- derer, one of the finest boats that I have ever seen. She met with a shocking fate the next year, being destroyed by fire, and of her passen- 86   UP TO TRAP.       87 sengers, numbering nearly three hundred, but few escaped. Dly room-mate was a very bright young fellow, a New Yorker, out upon a collecting tour for his employers, and, as a game of uker, that I played with him for amusement convinced me, a very skilful but honorable and gentlemanly player. He was returning to New Orleans, with a con- siderable sum of money that he had collected for the house he was attached to in New York; and I thought it proper to give him a word of warning about playing for money at all, and especially with strangers on board of a steamboat. He, however, laughed at my caution; said that this was not his first southern trip; that when last winter he went up the river, he fell in with a gambler who seemed to have taken a fancy to him, and who appeared to know all the principal tricks and marks of cards. He added, that as to these tricks, he had not the dexterity required to play them off, nor would he do so if he had, but yet was able to detect them in a moment; and that playing a straight- forward open game himself, with plenty of money and unflinching nerve, he had always the advan- tage of gamblers-so much of their attention being taken up by stocking the cards, and when    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6605-00000046"/> 88    COLONIZING DEAD MAN'S ISLAND. their plans were defeated, being always annoyed  and thrown off from their play.  He farther said, that against the gamblers he  enterta'ned a particular spite, as his brother some years since had been nearly ruined by them, when on a business trip similar to his own; and that although he never sought a game of poker, he also but seldom declined it. I still urged upon him the great danger to which he exposed himself, but he laughed at my advice, and finally called my attention to three persons then in the cabin, who he said he was morally certain came on board for no other pur- pose than to bleed him; and, added he, "they shall have the chance." Of course there was nothing more to be said by me, and before night he had gently slipped into the sporting gentlemen's net-ash they supposed- and was playing a quiet game, with moderate stakes. I watched the game very closely. It was evi- dent, that although apparently playing each for himself, it was a joint business after all among the chevaliers d'industrie; and after the game had lasted for a couple of hours or so, when the bet- ting ran at all high, there was but one hand oppo- sed to my room-mate in any one deal, and that one proved invariably the strongest of the three.   NO, YOU DON'T.      89 For some time after the commencement of the play, the gamblers evidently intended their pigeon should win, but they need not have taken the trouble, for win he did and would. As he had said, he had nerve enough for anything; plenty of money, knew when to press his play, and when, from the run of the cards against him, to keep in shore. Presently one of the gamblers proposed to go to the bar and procure a new pack of cards. "No sir!" replied my friend, "I prefer waiting until some one comes along whom we can send for them." "Do you suppose that I am going to run any game on you, sir?" demanded the gambler, in the  "Ancient Pistol" style. "No," was the quiet reply; "I know you are not." After this there were no more attempts at careless playing. The three did their best, but continued to lose. Supper time drew near, and the game was necessarily discontinued for a time. The three went forward, but I kept my eyes upon them, and observed the party assembled on the hurricane deck, at the stern of the boat evidently enga- ged in animated conversation. Of this I informed my friend, and advised him to break off the game    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6605-00000047"/> 90    COLONIZING DEAD MANUS ISLAND. where it was; but no, he would not hear a word  of quitting them or frightening them off.  After supper they went at it again with a much  higher ante, and the betting proportionately  increased. Many of the passengers were assem  bled around the table watching the game with interest, and evidently to the great annoyance of the sporting gentlemen, who made as many  remarks, and hinted quite as broadly as they  dared about intrusion; but as I have before  remarked, their day of rule was over, and they dared not, upon any ordinary occasion exhibit  that insolence, which, backed by their ever-ready weapons, had made them feared, dreaded, and too often submitted to, upon the river boats. Among the spectators was a tall, portly gentle- man, of a very dignified and commanding appear- ance; who, after intently watching the game for some time, gave me a quiet hint that he had something to say in private; and then walked out upon the guards of the boat. "Is that young man a friend of yours?" asked he. I told him all that I knew of him in a few words. "Well, sir," said he, "it's a bad business that he is engaged in; yet he seems to be a fine, hon- est fellow, plays fairly, and I think the best game   MAKE BEADY.       91 of poker that I have ever seen, but he is playing with three of the greatest scoundrels unhung; they do not know me I think, but I do them; and it will be a black day for the rascals, when I find them ashore in my State. They will play him some cantrip yet, mark my words; there is noth- ing that they are not up to; and even if his purse escape their clutches to-night, and there is no other way of fingering his money, they will rob him, if allowed to remain on board the boat; but that I will see to. Have you enough interest in the young man to remain by the table with me as long as they may continue to play?" I replied that I had. "Are you armed?" asked he. ( A case of pistols in my state-room," an- swered I "Get them, then," said he, "and meet me at the table in a few minutes. I wish to speak to the captain and clerk." For half an hour longer this game went on as usual; but at last, one of the gamblers, whose turn it was to deal, dropped the cards upon the floor and, I was very sure, changed them for another pack, probably kept ready under a hand- kerchief which was in his lap. My dignified friend gave me a look, and then placed himself in such a position that the gambler could not remove    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6605-00000048"/> 92 '   COLONIZING DEAD MAN' ISLAND. or conceal the first pack without being seen, if it : were indeed beneath the handkerchief, as I sup . posed. This manceuvre had not escaped the notice of my acute friend, who chose to let it pass for the moment, not intending to bet on any hand, how. ever good it might be, that he should hold this deal, as he afterwards told me: the most determi- ned man, however, cannot always resist tempta. tion. As he took up his cards I saw them-he had four aces (an invincible) dealt to him, as I thought at the time, by mistake; but the after- betting puzzled me. They had been playing for an ante of ten dol- lars, each putting up the whole pool in turn; the oldest hand had put up a "blind" of fifty dollars, and it was my friend's first say. lie "saw" the blind-that is, he laid down one hundred dollars, and then bet two hundred " better"--a capital play, and one very likely to be mistaken by his oppo- nents for a "bluff." The next hand "passed," and then drew his card; the dealer then "saw" the bet, and also bet two hundred dollars "bet- ter." Now, it was the oldest hand's turn; he had passed the first "say" by " going blind." He did not "make his blind good," but threw up his   IA STRONG GAME.               93 cards, and the contest was between the New Yorker and the Gambler. At this juncture you will perceive there were on the table seven hun- dred and ten dollars, and it was the New Yorker's turn. He appeared in deep thought for a mo- ment, examined his hand, studied it, took out a ;pocket-book, and not finding what he wanted, un- buttoned his vest, and after some time, pulled out a money-belt, and took from it several bills. "I will cover your bet, and bet you a thousand and forty-five dollars more," said he at last, as cool as a cucumber. g  "And what's the forty-five for " asked "Legs." "If you 'see' my bet, it will make even mo- ney," answered "New York." It was now the Gambler's chance, and he seemed very much excited, and his companions particularly fidgetty; he drew a roll of bills from his pocket, then asked his right hand man for the tobacco; it was handed to him under the table, and then he made his bet. "I believe you're bluffing me, hoss, and have a good mind to call you," said he, " but I won't, here; I'll 'see' your bet, and go five hundred more."

"New York" was counting his money. "See your five hundred, and go another thousand," said he, laying down three bills of the old United States Bank. "Legs" examined the money, looked very criti. cally at the pile of bills the New Yorker had by his side, which were seemingly of small amount, took a critical survey of the money-belt, consulted his companion's eyes, and then said with a hateful sneer- "Well, sir, here's your thousand, and that makes six thousand, on the table. Nice little sum; most enough to open a snug, quiet bank at Orleans; but here's five thousand better." "Hold on, hold on, stranger," cried "New York," " you oversize my pile; must have a show for my money, you know." "The d-1 you must," retorted "Legs." "If you back down, say so like a man, and then if you are flat-footed, I'd lend you a stake to start on. If you don't dare to call me, say so, and don't whine like a puppy or a baby, but give up like a man." The New Yorker turned very pale, raised his eyes to the surrounding crowd, as if to ask whether they deemed this fair play; then pre-   THE SWEAING COMMENCES.    95 tended to examine the money in the pool, but did not reply. "Quit handlin' them shin-plasters, hoss; it's no ways likely they'll trouble your pockets; and just call me, or I'll rake down the pile," growled out "Legs," in an excessively insolent manner. "One moment, sir," interrupted my new friend. "Here, sir, (throwing a pocket-book to the New Yorker,) call him, if you wish." Up jumped the three gamblers, pistol in hand; but before either could grasp the money, they were seized behind by three stalwart fellows, and then the swearing commenced; "This game shall be played out, noise or no noise. Open my pocket-book, sir, and use the money as you please. Mate, gag those fellows if they swear another oath," said the portly gentle- man, in the tone of one born to command. New York opened the book, found the requi- site amount, placed it on the table, and then "called." "Call and be - ; do you think outsiders can come around, lookin' at our hands, interfering with my game, and lending money? No siree, hoss," yelled out the gambler. "Will you divide the money, then " asked the gentleman. "Not a d- bit of it.

"Say, strangers, (addressing the spectators,) can't you see this is a put up thing--  and these two gamblers here are trying to rob a gentleman? Are you going to stand it?" "Turn over their hands," said the gentleman,  paying no attention to the other's words. The cards were faced; "New York" had four  aces; "Legs," two Jacks, king, queen and ten. "Pretty hand that last to bet eight thousand on," remarked the gentleman.  "Bloody robbery by -," yelled out the gami. bler; "but I'll have justice when I get to Orleans,  by .." "You shall, sir, and before, too; and when you d make your complaint, tell Mr. Baldwin that you a were robbed by the Governor of this State, sir; and if I had you ashore, you should have an op- t portunity of complaining that you expected to be  murdered also, on short notice; for as I live, if I  ever do catch you there, you will be handed over g to the Safety Committee before you can turn up  a Jack, smart as you are at it.

"Captain C--," continued he, addressing the commander of the boat, who had just made his appearance on the scene-is there any island about here that it would pay to colonize?" "Just exactly the very place, sir," returned the captain. "We're right above Dead Man's Island -going into the shute now, sir." "No inhabitants, I believe," demanded the Governor. "None, sir, but rattlesnakes, moccasins, and mosquitoes. Shall I land them there, sir?" "Yes, with a week's supply of bread; not one drop of liquor. Take their weapons away, and any tools of their trade that they may have about them; and if they have any letters or papers on their persons, let the clerk seal them up and deli- ver them to Mr. Baldwin, with my compliments. Adieu, gentlemen--continued he, addressing the gamblers, as the mate and his men were taking them off, gagged and bound-you will find your baggage and traps at the Recorder's office, when you arrive at New Orleans." "And now, sir"-(to the New Yorker)-" you nay return my loan; and if I might advise, I hink you had better present the large sum you iave just won to the orphan asylum, when you 71    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6605-00000051"/> 98    COLONI NG DEAD MAN7' ISLAND. arrive: and also, if you will excuse friendly ad. vice, let cards alone for the future, at least among strangers and steamboat travellers." "I feel truly grateful to you, sir," replied my young friend. "The money shall be disposed of as you suggest, and I have done with games of chance for life." And now, Uncle Billy, and Mr. Sam Slick, I should like to ask, if, for a quiet little adventure, this is not a match for any of your card-playing experiences?"   CHAPTER X. THE TWO DOCTORS-PETE  SHAM,  AM PETER AND          EBSALT PETER. "WELL, now I guess, squire," said Bunce, " it wasn't card-playin' alone that young chap wanted to be cured on. You see the card-playin' was nothing but one of the fruits of the tree, but the root of the evil was consate. If he hadn't a been a most a mighty self-consated critter, he never'd have slighted your advice. Ask Tfncle Billy, now, and he'll tell you it's only another shape of bein' too smart. Ask my cousin Sam, and he 'll say it's all human natur'; but I cal'late it's all consate; and I guess they're all pups of pretty much the same litter. In some folks you can see the consate stickin' out a feet; in others agin it strikes in. It makes the first bold and pushin', and sassy as pison, and the others shy, and proud, and clus-mouthed. Folks call the one brass and the other resarve; b9    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6605-00000052"/> 100 PETEr SHAM, SHAM PETER, AND SALT PETER but, squire, now it's jest the same complaint, I guess. I cal'late now its pesky like havin' the measles or small-pox; if it breaks out, it's worse for other folks; if it strikes in, its worse for your. self. When it's all over yer face, you ain't over and above agreeable to look at; other folks don't admire you much, but they'll give you the track, and putty spry too. But when it hides away in your stumik, er yer dyin' frame, as the doctor's call it, it's a pesky hard chance for you. Father-and he had a most amazin' gift of tellin' stories, that had plagy sharp pints to 'em, and it's a sorter family failin', too; there's Cousin Sam's got the disease dreadful-Father used to say, " ther's two kinds of consate, that ain't no kin in the world to each other. One kind of consate sets you to swallerin' hull, all sorts of stuff that you hear, and believin' it equal to scripter. The other-and that's self-consate-won't let ye be- lieve nothin'." And then he'd up and tell about the two young doctors, that sot out to be suthin' a good deal above par, and nothin' would sarve 'em but they must go on to France and England to get the finish put on. When the first one had sarved his time out, the old doctor he'd been a sarvin' under said to him, "Now, Eph, you've been three years with me, and I guess have read most all the docter books through that's worth I   SHEEPSESI AND HAR.     101 readin'. I've let you inter all the regular secrets of the trade, but there's one thing I havn't; it ain't printed in any of 'em, but is kept among the old stagers, just like the mason's keep their secrets. Young doctors stick to their books, and sometimes never find it out all their lives; but I've took a considerable wonderful shine to you, and you shall have it cheap; and between you and me and the bed-post, I've made my forten by it. Well, Eph wanted the secret right off; but the old doctor wouldn't let him have it only on two conditions. The first was five hundred dollars right down on the nail; the other, that it should be put in writin' in a letter, and it wasn't to be opened till the young feller'd been to sea a week. Well, they traded, and when the time cum, Ephraim opened the vallable paper, and all the writin' on it was, "Conslat will kill a mam, and consate will cure a manm" I guess tain't every day you see a chap sp riley as the young man was; but it couldn't be helped -no use cryin' for spilt milk, and so he had to grin and bear it; but it kept in his mind, and he turned it over and over, till he see there was suthin' in it arter all. When he'd got his foreign sheepskin and a pair of mustashers, he come home and sot up away off from where he was raised; and he worked the old    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6605-00000053"/> 102 PETER SHAM, SHAM PET, AND SALT PETER. docter's resate till it was equil to a Californy gold mine; but for all that, the five hundred dollars stuck in his crop, and he was detarmined to be even with the critter before he died. At last, the old doctor took a kinder notion to go out West, and one night he happened to stop at the very hotel where the other stayed. Arter supper he went into the bar-room, and there was the young one a talkin' away about some new kink that had jest turned up, when he spied his old friend, and knew him right off the reel, and settled in his mind how he'd sarve him out. So he went on with his talkin', only shiftin' himself round, so's to be nigh where the old man was a settin. Says he, "There ain't no mistake in it; by this new way that's been just found out, the medical man kin see the disease in the patient's face long afore it's known to the patient; and here, (pintin' to the doctor,) here's a case in pint. He looks hearty now don't he? Well, I tell you he hasn't more'n three days to live, without suthin more'n common's done for him. There ain't but one man this side of the Atlantic can cure him, and that's me." The old man jumped up mad as a hornet, and went off to bed; but he couldn't sleep a wink, for   IN A BAD WAY.      103 thinkin' of what he'd heard; it made him so ama- zin' mad. Next mornin', as he hadn't slept none, he couldn't eat, didn't feel well enough to go in the stage, and went up to his room and laid down. But he grew worse and worse, had a high fe ver that night and no sleep; couldn't eat next day. The tavern-keeper wanted he should call in, that amazin' smart docter that boarded with him; but he said he was a darned humbug, and wouldn't. When night come, he'd about made up his mind that he was done for, and did send for the doctor. Well, he come, looked at him, and says he, "If you had treated me like a gentleman, I'd have re- moved the cause of the disease at once, and with- out taxin' you; for I see ye're a docter too; but you've called me a humbug. If I don't save you to-night you're a dead man; to-morrow will be top late. You wouldn't trust me, and I shan't trust you, but if you valley your life at five hundred dollars, send me the money or a draft for it, and I'll send you a perscription that'll set you up agin." Afore long the money come, and the young man sot down and wrote, "Consate will kill and consatle will cure a man," on a sheet of paper, sealed it up, and sent it to the sick man's room.    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6605-00000054"/> 104 PETER SHAM, BHAM PETER, AD SALT PETER. The old doctor took it, and jest could get it open, he was so pesky weak; but the minit he read it, up he jumped as well as ever; singin' out, "it's that consarned Eph; I thought I know'd him ;" ordered a beef-steak, slept sound upon it, and was off bright and arly next mornin'--per. fectly satisfied that his perscription was correct, for it had been tried on himself. Now for t'other kind. The other docter went to Paris, and afore long consated that he could beat all created natur' a docterin', so he sot out for London, on his way home. When he got to Calais, he found an Eng- lishman layin' there, plaguy nigh doctered to death. He'd had a leetle fever, but that had been physick'd and starved out of him, and he was een a most gone for want of suthin' to eat. When he heard another doctor was in the house, and that he wasn't a Frenchman, he had him brought up to his room straight off, and beg- ged him for suthin' nice to eat, like roast beef and plum puddin'. The young man seein' he was jest agoin,' with not more'n six hours life in him, went down, told the landlord to give him whatever he asked for, and in three days John Bull was able to kick his French doctors out of the room when they called to see him, and to hand over a plaguy fat fee to the Yankee, s r1    A NEW CURE.       105 The young doctor's eyes stuck out at the cure, and he consated he'd made a diskivery that beat Christopher Columbus all to nothin'. And so he wrote down in his note book, "Roast beef and !plum-puddi?' a sure cure or intermittent fever." Over the creek goes the docter, and when he gets to Dover, there he finds a poor Frenchman in his tavern, down with a fever too. So he went to braggin' how monstrous cute he was in them kind of complaints, and he got the job. Roast beef and plum-puddin' was ordered, and stuffed down the poor feller's throat, and in twelve hours he'd quit this country for the Frenchman's Paradise-- though where that is, I guess I couldn't tell. Well, this didn't change the doctor's idees of his import- ant diskivery, only he'd made a new one. He scratched out the first entry, and then wrote down-- "FOR INTOEBMTTE FEva.- Roast Beef and Plzvun-piddin's sure cue for an Englishman and sartin death for a Frenchman." This chap, ye see, had got the other sort of con- sate so strong on him that it was sartin to mark him for life. I ain't a tellin' these stories as any- thing bran new, but they 're what father used to tell me years ago. When I fust come to the South, I went down to    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6605-00000055"/> 106 PETER SHAM, SHAM PETER, AND SALT PETER. York, and got a passage in the old La Fayette to Charleston. In them days folks used to go by sailin' vessels; there was a steamboat or two a runnin', but 'twarn't long after the Pulaski and the Home had made a most amazin' awful, piece of bisnis, and folks kinder thought sails was safest arter all; and to tell you a secret, I ain't fairly got over that old fogy notion yet. We had forty passengers in the cabin, and some plaguy queer fish amongst 'em. There was a young chap that 'tracted a good deal of notice right off. Soon's he come aboard, he pulls off his boots and puts on sailor pumps, takes off his over. coat, and gets into a rough petersham pea-jacket; then he begins long yarns about what in amazin' grand sailor he was, and how much he'd been to sea, and afore we'd got away from the dock, he was a runnin' up one of the shrouds and down another; but I took notice that he was partickler to crawl through the lubber-hole. Now, the critter had never been to sea in all his born days, but was one of them York boys that loaf round the dock, a hangin' about vessels, and a climbing all over 'em, when the old folks think they're safe at school. We hadn't got hauled out inter the stream afore the rest on us got a handle fixed to his axe, and it   SHAMPETE.        107 was "Petersham ;" and most a grand name it was; it was named after his coat, and it could be turned like a coat, and altered like a coat. Arter a while, when we found what kind of a sailor he was, we turned it, and called him "Sham-Peterf' and then afore long, for pertickeler reasons, we cut off the tail intirely, makin' a round-jacket on it, and givin' it a new collar--that is, we called him "Salt-Peter." While we was a runnin' down the bay, Peter was everywhere and inter everything. I could see the captin's eyes was sot on him, and he was a cus- sin' him all alone to himself, but there was ladies on deck, and we warn't in blue water yet; and so the old man was on his best superfine manners. Every thing was in a snarl, as it always is in a ship just gittin' to sea; and any way she was the most lumbered up ship I ever see. As for Peter, he was a helpin' everybody. When we cast off the tow-boat, Peter was a standin' right on a coil of rope that was a goin' to be run out. The mate spied him, and sung out- "Hallo! you, stand clear of yer legs there." "And how cam I do that, sir?" asked Peter, as innocent as a nussin' lamb. He hadn't got the words fairly out, when whiz goes the cable, up goes Peter, jerked right a-top of a great hawser, coiled up, turns a fair summer-    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6605-00000056"/> 108 PETERSHAM SEHAM-PETr, AND SALT-PETEE. set, and pitches slap down off the quarter-dek head first into a slush-bucket. The men run to him, and picked him up; and sich a lookin' crit- ter, with a new-fashioned wodden' hat on, and the lush a runnin' down his face and all over his clothes. When he got clear of the bucket, he sneaked off below, feelin' plaguy cheap, and lookin' dread. ful nasty; .but when the bell rung for lunch, the first man on the docket was Peter, in a span new rig; his hair, though, didn't want any top-dressin' or hair-ile for the next six months. For two days, the first man at the first table was Peter; but on the third mornin' he was down as common to breakfast, but afore he'd got a mouth. ful swaller'd, suthin' come acrost him; he turned blue about the gills, and crawled up the con panion ladder. The main deck was awful lumbered up; there was two tier of barrels, and on them the big- gest pile of cabbages I ever see; and when we come up from breakfast, there was Peter mounted up a-top of 'em, to get all the fresh air he could; and a most dreadful misfortinit lookin' critter he was, too; and to make it worse, the boys begin a pokin' fun at him. "Peter," says one, "4I guess you'll lose your   SALT PETiR.       109 breakfast, if you don't stir up your shanks and make tracks below." "I kinder cal'late he's lost it already," says another. "I'm dreadful afear'd Peter's got the cholery," says number three. "Can't be sea sick, he's such an old salt; Pm pesky fear'd it's cholery." "Have the captin called right straight off," says four, "and if he has got it, I guess it 'll be best for him and all on us to have him chucked overboard quick's possible. It'll be easier fer him, and we musn't have the complaint a spread- in' amongst the rest on us." But Peter didn't pay one mite of attention, and there he stuck. By Jemimy I how the wind did blow.

We tried to coax him, and skear him down, but it wasn't one mite of use. He'd mounted up there afore eight o'clock, and there he sot at half past two; and I guess he'd be settin' there yet, if there hadn't come along a rale rip-snorter of a sea, that took us quarterin' and broke right over the ship.

It's a sartin sign of foul weather when a ship's under bare poles, and you may be sure of it when you see them pesky little critters, Mother Carey's chickens, a flyin' round the starn, and when the steward can't set the table, and you kin hear the crockery a smashin' in the cubberd; but when you find all the women folks a leavin' their own diggins, and gittin' into the main cabin fer consolation, you may know that the very old boy's to pay. Now, our women folks was under the captin'so charge every one on 'em. They didn't know any of the men aboard, and stuck up their noses so mighty high at us, that I was dreadful afeard some on 'em would tumble over backards; but when the harricane come on, goodness sakesl how they huddled in amongst us, and sot up so close; and when the ship creen'd over, they'd give leetle squeaks, and catch hold of our arms, and maybe round our necks, or anywhere handy; and when the staysail went all to bits, with a che- bang! like a cannon, there was a young heifer, and not a bad lookin' one either, jumped right at me, and got her arms round me, and hung on like grim death, and begged me to save her. The climit was a gittin' a leetle too warm for me, and up on deck I went; and there things was   ON OIR BEAM-ENDS.      118 improvin' for the worse, and putty fast too. After the staysail was tore to pieces we hadn't a rag left to steer by, and the officers held a council of war; for the mountaneous waves was a rollin', and wind a blowin' us onto the shore, and the captin said we'd get there too, in two or three hours. Our captin got most awful skeart, and I do raly believe if it hadn't a been for another sea captin aboard, we'd all been in glory or some other Chris. tian country afore mornin'. He said the ship must carry sail whether she could or not, and so they got on the topsails close reefed, and she stood it pretty well. About six o'clock I was up above when they called all hands on deck to wear ship, and I rather guessed I'd best be down in the cabin; more out of the way sorter. I'd just got my hand on the side of the com- panion hatch, when the ship give a lurch over to larberd, and in a minit up she come agin, and slap she goes t'other way, and on her beam ends, afore yon could say Jack Robinson. I hung on with my hands like all creation, and my legs was swept down the stairs by a great swash of water. Away went cabbages and deck load, and away went starboard bulwerks, but the ship righted in a minit; if she hadn't, she'd never a held up her head agin. 8    <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6605-00000059"/> "4       THh WRONG PFEW. When the trouble come, I was a standin' jest where I could see the hull cabin. The steward had put on the vittles on the table in tin pans, and the folks was a settin' on the settees aginst the berths, holdin' onto their cups and sassers. When the ship lurched to port, she threw the hull display of vittles off the table onto the folks -they were all a settin' on the port side, on a double row of settees-and when she come back in such a plaguy hurry, away went the hull biin', men, wimmen, vittles, cups, sassers and settees, slam-bang under the table, jest as slick as grease; and the ship righten agin, the table, which was a swingin' one, swung back and shot right down on 'em. I never see such a sight in all my born days, and if the ship had sunk then, I'd have gone down a laughin', and mouth wide open. Peter was in his berth, with nothin' on but his shirt. He was landed right a top of the table; one chap was lyin' pesky sick near the companion hatch, and he shot over across like a sky-racket, and plumped into a berth, right a top of a fat old man, that had gin in long ago.

Now, there was poor Peter- on the table, with nothin' on but his shirt-and that too of a plaguy scant pattern--sick as death, and stunned and sore with the awful tumble he'd jest got, to say nothin' of that when he was onshipped from the cabbages --he rubbed his eyes a minnit, to find out where he was, and the poor forlorn critter scrabbled for the table-cloth, that hadn't gone with the dishes, and drawed it all over him, head and all; and there he lay, a groanin' and a beggin' for help; but    <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6605-00000060"/> "6      THE WRONG PEW.  when we picked him up, he hung on to his table. cloth like all-possessed. This sot me to thinkin', that the dear little crit. ters don't have all the modesty there is a goin', although they'd like to make us men folks believe so; and it sorter minded me of bein' made a most a grand fool of, and gettin' into a most shockin' nasty scrape when I was a boy. When I was may be fourteen year old, suthin' took Father down to York, and I'd heard so many despert stories about the place, that I sot in strong as pison to go long; and mother she took my part, and said it would be a most dreadful pity not to give me a chance to see suthin' of the world, spe- cially as they was a goin' to give me a liberal edi- cation, and make a lamed man of me-that was mother's notion, although father went agin it, tooth and toe-nail. But she always would have it that I was a master hand for larnin'-a rale, first- rate nat'ral genius, and would be an honor to the family, and no mistake. Well, as I was sayin', mother sot in so strong that father had to give in. Well, we went in a steamboat, not one of them bustin' great double-deckers, with cabins and state- rooms all over, that they have now-a-days, but a plaguy little narrer-contracted critter-though I guess she looked as big to me as all out a doors-- cabins all down below, and divided in two parts.

In the mornin' my new clothes looked jest's if I'd been to work in a cotton factory; and father, he started me right off to find the steward, and get 'em brushed; for he said he wouldn't go about the streets in York with no such a linty lookin' critter as me. I hadn't any sort of an idee what kind of a lookin' thing a steward was; so up on deck I went, and looked to see if I could see anything that seemed like it; but I examined the boat from stem to stern, and had to give in. Down I went to father, and told him I couldn't find any steward. "Where have you looked 1" says he. "Everywhere," says I; "I've been up where the man's a steerin', and all about the bilers, and looked in the boat that's a hangin' down behind; but I can't see anythin'." "You etarnal created goose,",says father, mad as darnation, " where did you expect to find him?    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6605-00000061"/> "8      THE WRONG PEW.

So I made my man. ners, and says I, "Please sir, can ye show me whareabouts they keep the steward?" "Oh, sartinly, with pleasure," says he. "What a graceful bow you do make.

"Let me alone for that," says I; and I'd hardly said it, afore he opens the door and shoves me in; and the merciful gracious! I swan to man, I never see such a sight afore ner sence; and I never was so skeart in my life. It was where the wimin' folks stopt, and there was more'n fifty on 'em. Some getten' down out of the top berth; some puttin' on their stockin's; some a cordin' themselves up; some with a few clothes on, and some with none at all. By Jemimy, didn't they squeel? If I'd a been a wild varmint, lookin' for my breakfast, and all ready to gobble 'em down, they couldn't have made more noise. Some crawled back into the berths; some stop- ped a drawin' on their stockin's, and some yelled out "get out!" "I can't get out," I holler'd-and I bohoed right out-" some feller's a holdin' the door, and won't let me." "What do you want? ,Who sent you here? What are you after?" they holler'd. I'm after the steward, and I want to get my clothes dusted," I cried.

"I'll larn you where  the steward's room is." And with that she open'd the door, and give me a kick on the starn-post, that sent me a tumblin' and a howlin' half the length of the cabin.

"Now," continued Bunce, " its a fact, and one of the darndest funny facts, too, I ever see, that three of the biggest kind of sparkin' matches growed out of this ere capsize. Afore the storm, there's no tellin' how dreadful high the wimmin folks did carry their heads, but the storm brought 'em down to their bearin's pretty spry.        ; I tell ye what 't is, men, sea-sickness and fear  brings us all down to a level, pretty nigh the same as if the bony old skilleten, that used to be in the  i front part of our old catechise, with a dreadful long scythe in his hand, and these lines under his  feet-- "Death cuts down all,           !

And then, agin, may-be it was the stockin's and garters, and the et ceteries, sot the men agoin'. How it was, I can't say for sartin, but it's an undeniable fact, that six on 'em was took with the disease all of a suddent; sot in for the hardest kind of sparkin', and kep it up, too; and one of the cases came to a fatal eend; and it wouldn't surprise me the least mite, if all  the rest did, too. There was an old, long-legged down-easter aboard, that kep' store down to Selmy, in Ala- bamy, with a reg'lar hatchet face, and putty much the same kind of a complexion as a dried codfish. He must a been hard onto sixty year old, as nigh as we could make out, but jumped about as spry as a kitten, and wanted to pass him- self off among the boys, as one of 'em. The old critter's hair looked so dreadful slick and shiny, that putty much all on us came to the conclusion that he didn't wear his own-not onless he'd paid for it. Well, we didn't let on, and he figu- red about, without havin' any carlicues cut up with him, 'till after our capsize; but when he got to steppin' up to a most amazin' scrumptious kind of a gal, e'en about the pick of the lot-they'd been neighbors under the table, and may-be that   ?   MAJORE OGERS.       123 was her excuse-I tell you, if we didn't open on him; and old Pond-that was his name-catched it pretty much all over. We detarmined to catch the feller with his wig off, and took turns settin' up, so's to see him when he took it off; but 't wouldn't do: for the first night we tried it, he set up tell mornin'; and the next, the consarned critter went to bed with his hair on; and when one of us made a mistake on a purpose, and drawed his curtins, there-was old Pond, a snorin' haleluya, with his head tied up in a old red silk handkercher, big enough for a gal- lant-sail. We had another old chap on board, Majer Ro- gers; and though he wasn't a Georgy Majer, he was jolly enough for one, and e'en-a-most up to   ! anything a goin'.

"Then, boys," says the MDajer, "IJX with ye;  and I kinder guess we'll make him show his grey  hairs, or where they oughter be, afore we show  the respect that oughter be paid 'em."  "Give us yer hand, Majer," says I; "; ye're a trump, and allers was; but 't ain't no use, least- ways not by fair means; and I cal'late it wouldn't f hardly pay to go at him by foul ones; and so, if  we can't get that consarned wig off his sculp with h out his 'spectin' what it was did for, why I guess   AT STAKE"-A WARM GAME.     125 we'd a consid'able best wait; and may-be it'll come off itself one of these fine days."

"But when, and how will you do it?." says I. "As to when I'll do it, that depends pretty much on what time the second-mate's watch ends to-night. As to how it'll be done, I guess that won't consar jyou much, as long as it's done up brown. Y  jest hold on a minnit, and let me have a leetle talk with the mate, and then I'll tell ye more." "Well, the Majer went off to where Scott, the second-mate was a standin', and there was putty. consid'able whisperin' agoin on betwixt 'em for a few minits; and at last, we saw Scott bust out a laffin; and then the Majer comes back, and says he- "Boys, Scott's watch is- out at midnight, and I invite ye all to be at the companion-hatch at that    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6605-00000065"/> 126     STOCKaNGS AND GARTERS. hour; and be plaguy certin to keep dark about it, and not go to blabbin' out about the ship. And mind you, be jest as quiet as lambs when the time comes." Well, we 'promised, and what's more, we kept our promises; and may-be, when midnight come, we wasn't at the companion-hatch. The cabin was all still 's a quaker meetin' when the speret don't move, all exceptin' the music of the reg'lar band-and they was in full blast, playin' old hundred, sawin' wood and snortin' like troopers' horses, and old Pond's nose a leadin' the. orkestry. Scott walks down, opens the curtins of his berth, and givin' him a shake to wake him up, says in a kinder rough whisper- "EHurray, matey I for the massy Be turn out quick, and get on deck-we're goi i wn in five minits 1" Old Pond open'd his eyes, see the mate over him, with the big lantern a flashin' in his face, and catched enough of his words to skear him into chicken fits.   ' Out he tumbled, a yellin' The ship's a sinkin I the ship's a sinkin'!" made three jumps to the companion-way, and up stairs he bust, as if the old sarpint was arter him and spurrin' him on with his forked tail; but, spry as he pulled foot,   "GHT RIGGING.      127 the Major was right behind; and just as Pond touched the deck, the Major made a grab at Pond's head-riggin', and away went the Major and Pond's bandanna down stairs, kolumpus, inter the cabin; and there stood Pond in his shirt tail, and the wind a floppin' that about putty consid'- able, the moon shinin' bright on his bare sculp, and he a yellin' "Help!

Up come captin and mates, and men and women, a rollin' up the companion-way, without a rag too much on any one on 'em; some yellin' and shriekin', and some a cussin'; and I cal'late, for a minit or two there was as pretty a muss as ever you'd wish to see. "What's this all about, and what's the mat- i ter?" roartiit the captin. "Oh we're a sinkin', and we'll all be drown'd," says Pond. "Where's the boats? Oh I Captin, save my life, and I'll give you a thousand dollars, in store pay." "Why, you darn'd fool," yelled out the captin, "are ye drunk or crazy?

"Some one woke me up, sir, and told me the ship was siinn'," says Pond, a shiverin' and a shakin'. ' No such thing, sir," says Scott. "My watch was putty nigh up, and I went down to call the first mate; and I went to the wrong berth; that's all, sir." "Didn't ye tell me the ship would sink in five minits t'" asked Pond. " No 8r," answered Scott. " I told you we was a goin' down in five minutes-and so we be- cause our watch 's up, d' ye see." " What an immortal jackass you must be, Mis- ter Pond," says the captin, "to make all this row about nothin' at all; it's my guess that you won't hear the eend of this for a while." By this time Pond come a leetle to his right senses; and feelin' pesky cold abon  e head, he claps his hand up to his sculp-if every hair on it was turned to a spear of mint, there wouldn't a been enough for a julip-and when he see what a perdickemint he was in, darn my picter if the crit- ter didn't grab hold of'the hind part of his shirt, draw it over his bare head, and bust through the crowd and inter the cabin, afore I could have swaller'd this glass of whiskey."

"None at all, squire," replied the pedler; "they was all so most amazin' skeart, that they didn't know whether his scalp was bare or whether it had a ton weight of hair." "But the other passengers must have noticed it," inquired I. "Nary one," he answered, "but what was in the play; and so we let the thing work, and didnt meddle for a while; but I tell you, he had a putty warm time of it with the captin and some of 'em, about the skear he gin 'em all; and what he minded wus ner all, they tried him next day, for creatin' disturbance and alarm 'board ship, and fined him champaign for the hull crowd, and he had to stalI it." "But the wig," asked I, " was that the end of it, and didn't the girl find out that he wore one, after all ?" "May-be she did'nt" said he.

They had streamers before and be- hind, and all sorts of fixins and riggins, though they'd kept themselves putty scrumptious, and there wa'nt half the difference in their looks that there was in the old wimmen's.

Fust of all, they'd raised a most amazin' crop of curls in the night-I'd like to know what kinder top-dressin' they put on; I'd make a fortin out on't a leetle the quickest; get Barnum  to go halves, and shell out the pewter for advertisin'; call it "Sam Slick's universal, instantaneous hail restorer for the fair seck." Then they'd got the biggest kind of cotton breast-works on, like old Ginral Jackson to Orleens; and besides, they had some how 'nother raised at the shortest kinid of notice what the doctor here'd call most astonishin' fundamental developments, and stuck out in that direction fully equal to a Hottentot beauty, who   <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6605-00000068"/> 182    BUsTLS Air BREAST-WORKS. can carry a pail of water on her hump, and run up  hill without spillin' a drop.

Well, I tried it, and it did come, I tell ye, fully equal to a spirt of molasses out of a hogsit, when it's been shuk up on a York cart, and laid in the sun the hull of a July day.

Then the men folks did the same, and finally all hands give up Charleston, and every one board ship looked blue as blazes-all but the cook, who, seein's turnin' blue wasn't in his line, no how, looked blacker than a thunder-squall off Hat- teras. A pesky dirty-weather, mean day we had of it, and long towards night some on us had just got quietly settled down to a little game of curds, when down come the captin a blazin'.

Up jumped a chap from Orleens, that was a playin' with us, sprung between the companion way and the captin, and jerkin' out a pistil, he cocks it, and aims right at cantankerous critter's head. "Now," says he," you no 'count whelp, take back every word of saas you've give us, or I'm blest (I guess it wasn't " blest" he said either,) if I don't see if there's any brains in that numskull of yours.

"No, Mr. Dunbar," ses he, "that's not the way to treat this matter; put up your weapon. And you, sir, (to the captain) on this vyage, have showed yourself neither sailor nor gentlemen.

THE FATAL MILK BOTTLE--TWO TRUTHS TO ONE LIE. "Tim first night we was in Charleston, all the men of our party exceptin' old Pond, met in the bar-room, and was a smokin' away, and takin' comfort--  " "Wer that ar red-eye, or old peach?" inter- rupted Uncle Billy.

As I was sayin', Pond wasn't there, and we missed him mighty quick. "Where on earth's Pond?" asked Rogers. "Bet a horse he's in Miss James' room," ses I. "Bet drinks," ses the major, " he ain't." "Done," ses he-and done it was, and he was, too, as it turned out. "Here, boy," ses I, to a culled individial, "jest take up this newspaper to Miss Jemes's room, with my compliments; and, say, you    jest take a squint inside, and see who's with her. 139   <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6605-00000072"/> "O     THE FATAL AtM TTLET      j In less than no time back comes the boy, a  grinnin' like a chesse-cat.

"Well, I dunno zackly," ses the boy. "'spec dey was sparkin' a little, das all." "What makes you guess so?" ses I.  "Why you see, mossa,"-ses he, a grinnin', and a scratchin' among the wool,-" da was only one chear a standin' out in de room, and dey bofe turned mighty red when I poke my head in da."  "Well," sea I " there's a quarter; now travel,  and jest shut up shop about this." The major paid up like a man, and we sot in to layin' plans, and at last I hatched one out, that they give in was first chop-A. No N 1-if we could only find out the right man to work it, "Old Frenchy 'll fix us out, I know," sea I; "and I motion, we visit him to-morrow evenin' accordin' to his invite." They all agreed; and the next day, arter din- ner, we all sot out to find his shop. That wasn't much trouble, but finding him was; for the old woman-a little apple-dumplin' of a body, ust   EilBSBLE X TiT LAST.    141 like him-told us he'd gone out to a garden, to make a fate with his friends, and celebrate his return. Arter walkin, and huntin' and askin', for nigh onto an hour, we found it, and we found him, and we found a lot of Crapo's with him. They'd been at their high strikes, and was putty well up in the picters. The empty bottles was layin' around putty thick, and the company gin- rally was a howlin' out French songs-evry man on his own hook. The old man, though, was sensible to the last, and could listen to bisnis, but not till he'd hugged us all round, and druv a bottle of most amazin' sour wine down every one's throat. When I got him to listen to reason, I told hin jest what we wanted-a barber, who was smart enough to play out the play we'd fixed up for him. "I got ze vary man here," says he-"Monsher Auguste, my moss eentemate friend-he is freezer like to no body in all Char-less-tone." "Freezer You punkin-head"  interrupted Allen--"friseur you mean, I suppose." "Well, I guess"-continued Bunce-" they're putty much the same when they're biled.

"Agreed," said the Doctor; "go ahead." "I will," replied Bunce, " but for the gracious sakes don't bother any more. Well, you see, I felt dreadful uncertin about any man in that com. pany being sober enough to carry out the joke, but I didn't like to give offence; and so, ses H "But, monsheer, havn't your friends been en. jien' themselves rather too much to carry this thing out straight as a ramrod?" "Not one beet," ses he, "Auguste shall do avry sing j uste so you tell heem. Monsheer Auguste, you please come zis way one menute." Monsheer Auguste come out, and considerin' what kind of red flannel he'd lined his jacket with, got hold of my idees amazin' quick. We had co nsideble diffikelty in gittin' away from the company, but made out at last, and got back to our hotel afore supper-time. We all got supper, and kinder sot round the bar-room, a smokin' and a talkin', and a guessin' how it would all turn out, when, after an hour or so, a waiter come in, and told me that some one wanted to see me. Out I went, and there, sure enough, was mon- sheer Auguste, .in full dress barber rig-white apron, tin box, and all complete and bang up.   SYMPTOMS OF A ROW.     143 I called the-boys, and up stairs we went, awful still and quiet. When we got near the room, we stuck ourselves agin the wall, so's to be out of sight, but hear the fun. The barber goes to the door, and taps plaguy soft; no one comes. Then harder; no one yet. Then a regular rat-tat-too. Then the door opens, and a gal's voice asks, "Who's there? What do you want?" "Ees Monsheer Pond een?" asks the barber-- taking off his hat dredful perlite. "Ye-e s," drawled out the gal, considable asha- med like. "I moss see him emajatlee, vary particulear," answers Auguste. "The door opens, we hear Pond walkin' towards it, and Auguste walks in. "What in thunder do you want with me? who are you and who sent you here?" growled out Pond, as cross as a bear with a sore head. "I come to ze hotel," says Auguste, "I go to ze bar-keep, I ask for Monsheer Pond, and ze bar- keep tell ze boy, 'you shall show zis gentilman to Monsheer Pond. You weel find heem  in zat ladese room where he always stay'-and so he show me op."

When Pond heard the monsheer's account of his "gittin' up stairs," he blew out like a house a'fire. "Confound the bar-keeper; and confound his impidence; and confound this house; and darn me if ever I set foot in't agin. And as for you, mister, now you have found me, what in creation do you want?" "I am Monsheer Auguste, ze freezer, zat you, send for," ses the barber. "1 sent for," ses Pond. And what should 1 send for you for?" "You moss have vare bad memry, monsheer; you have send fore me fore dress your veeg," an- swers barber. "My veeg! you impartinent jackanapes. I ain't got no wig; I don't wear no wig," roared out Pond. "Pardon, monsheer, I am not jack-and-ape, and you do vare a veeg. I can see him now juste so plain as noting at all." "You lie, you French scoundrel. You've been sent to insult me, I've got no wig." "Ensulte you? You ensulte me. I am gentil- home; artiste; you shall fight wiz me.

The barber had got a leetle too much excited, and played a plaguy sight stronger game than we'd chalked out for him. The gal squealed right out. Pond was dum- struck for a minit, then made a dive for the bar- ber-barber made aldive for the door; through the passage both went, tarin' like mad. Jest as barber got to the stair-head Pond grabbed him, and away they went, head over heels, rolling down. Barber's box flew open, and the powder flew out, coverin' both of 'em all over, and pla. guy nigh chokin' 'em to death. They landed in the next passage, and was picked up by some of the crowd the rumpus had raised. Barber coughs awful, slaps his hat on his head with a dredful savage air, shakes his fist at Pond, and marches out. Pond-stands a minit, all struck up, coughs too, and tries to clear his mouth of the powder, then claps his hand to his head, and scuds for his room under bare poles. Well, boys, the eend of the matter was, that the wig was found in the gutter, in a dredful nasty fix. 10    <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6605-00000075"/> "6    yTH FATAL MLK BOTTLE. Pond lay a bed next day, while it was docter'd up, and Miss Jemes was off in the first train for Ham. burg next mornin'." "And so ends the episode of Pond's wig," said Milward. "But Sam, don't you think you acted very wrong, in breaking up a match, that might have resulted in happiness to both parties, even if one did wear a wig." "Don't know about the happiness part of the bisniss," answered Bunce; " think it most amazin' unsartin, and didn't break off the match nither." "How do you know?" asked the Judge. "Why," aswered Bunce," I'll tell you. About two years after I was to Milledgeville, awaitin' the stage for Augusty, and when it come in, it come sorter double-barrell'd-the reglar stage was jam full, and there was an extra put on, and that was jam full too, and a leetle more. Well, I got in; I sot on the front seat, and there was a man and his wife and baby on it besides, and a leetle she darkey-sorter nuss like-curled up in the stage bottom, top of our feet. There's no tellin' what an amazin' awful fix the roads was in. It had been astonishing wet and muddy, and then jest turned cold, and froze up the ruts jest as they was.

At this house our driver quit, and went back on a return stage, and the old boy was to pay. There was a piece of road ahead so awful bad that the stage must go through the woods to get round it; and that wasn't the worst nither, for they put a chap on our stage that never drove on the line afore, and ordered him to keep up with the mail, whatever happened. Now it was between midnight and day-break, cold as blue blazes, and dark as a pocket in *a shirt, and the mail couldn't be seen only by keepin' right slap agin it. By mighty! didn't we catch it though; the mail driver knew all the bad spots, and druv round 'em or went over 'em easy, but our chap had to go right straight on through everything and over everything--every once in a while run- ning slap into the mail, and bringing up with a jerk that sent us sky high. One minit we'd be a mashin' our hats and a poundin' our heads agin the top of the stage, and in half a shake reducin' t'other extremity to a hu- man jelly.

BOTTOMRY SURVEY.      149 Well, we got the stage stopped at last, both lamps off the box, man out on the ground, and commenced surveyin' the damages. There wasn't cut, ner scratch, ner bruise, only what was the nateral result of the bumpin'; but his breeches was soaked through with milk, and one of his coat- tail pockets full of broken glass. The poor fright- ened critter had come down kolumpus on a quart bottle of milk-baby stores-made an everlastin' smash of it, and the warm milk he'd mistook for blood. But that wasn't all;*for when we'd done our survey, I raised the lamp, and if it wasn't old Pond and his wife-Miss Jemes that had been- I'd been a ridin' long side of, I wish I may be chissel'd. I was most amazin perlite the rest of the way, and took turns holdin' the baby; but don't ye think, they never give me an invite to come and stop with 'em, when I went to Selmy, though I told 'em I was expectin' to be there afore spring." (At this moment a peculiar sound like the rend- ing asunder of a strong piece of cotton cloth was heard in the room, although no one appeared to notice it but myself.) "Sam," asked the Judge, "do you expect us to take all your stories for gospel?" "Well, I don't know," he replied, "that de-    <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6605-00000077"/> 150     THE FATAL MLK BOTTLE. pends mostly upon yourselves. Folks that's givin' to makin' things outer whole cloth ain't over apt to swaller all they hear." "Why, you impertinent"-began the Judge. "Oh, never mind," interrupted Bunce; "didn't mean nothin', but rather guess I'd best tell you a short story; 't ain't very new, but it comes putty much to the pint. An Indian once went into a traders store down to Maine, and offered to sell a deer for a quart of rum. "Where's your deer?" asked the trader. "You know great bend in brook-mile-so?" "Yes." "You know great tree, most on bank ." "Yes." "You go to brook, you go to tree, you find 'em deer hangin' on 'em tree." The trader measured out his rum, and sent after the deer, but that was among the missin'. A week or so afterwards the trader see the Indian in the street, and stopped him. "You rascal," says he, " where's the deer I tra ded for t'other day!" "You no find 'em brook?" asked'red skin. Yes."  "You no find 'em tree?" ;"Yes."   IA MORAL MAN.      151 Uhgh I two truths for one lie, good for Indian." "Well," said the Judge, "I accept the point, and shall enter a rule, that in future it shall apply to your yarns, Sam; but as you are decidedly a moral man, let's know what moral you deduce from all this." "A grist of 'em," replied Bunce. "Never judge of a man's age by his hair, ner a woman s, by her curls, ner of nither as you would a horse -by the teeth. All is n't gold that's shiney. Don't carry milk-bottles in your coat tails in stages over bad roads; and above all, if you get two truths for one lie, as you go along through the world, be satisfied; you've done better 'n the average." [Here I again heard a ri-ii-ip, louder and more prolonged than the former.] "Well," said Bunce, "I shouldn't wonder if some one'd got a consideble turkey on."    <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6605-00000078"/> CHAPTER XV.

"Well, well," said Allen, "Uncle Billy, that's rather rich, considering how many turkeys Sam has shouldered in his time, and how distressingly fat some of them were." "There, Doctor, that'll do," returned Bunce, "You're a helpin' my case amazinly, and a makin' it a nation sight better.

Now, Mr. Roberts, you might as well out with it. Where did that saying come from?" "Well, boys," commenced Uncle Billy, "I'm in for't, that's a fact, and I wish I had let it alone. I'm willin' to talk all the rest of the night, and hit's half gone aready; but dern my skin ef this is any too safe a critter to ride. Why, if half the men in this settlement knew what I wer' a tellin', I'm dog-on ef they wouldn't rout out and give your Uncle Billy a dry ride. You'd see me, in consideble less than no time, cavortin' around town-dern putty town, ain't it?-mounted on a wooden poney, and the biggest eend of t'other half would be a laughin' at the fun. I don't mind you, boys, but rayther reckon it ain't safe to name names, and so I'll jest say I allow most on ye know a certin man, a most aston- ishin' big catfish, that I'll call the Ginral. I rsckon ye'll be mighty apt to tell who I mean." We assured him that it was not over difficult to know who was intended.    <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6605-00000079"/> 154 GETTING A TURKIEY ON-A c GENERAL"HUNT. "Well, boys, I reckon'd so," resumed Roberts. "I reckoned so. Now I'll tell ye one or two rale curus things about the Ginral; but mind, you're bound to keep shady, and not git me inter a diffi- kilty. Some years ago, and, come to think on't, a smart time it is-much's seven er eight-the Ginral had his bills up for a high office, and it wer allowed putty much all over that he'd get it, too. One part of the settlers hated him worse'n pison, and one part wer ready to fall down on thar bare knees to him; and one chap-old Cunle Black-it war univarsally allowed expected to go the Ginral, when he died. The settlers wer putty much split in two about him-part fer, and part aginst; and about the same number both sides. Hit were mighty clar that his election depended upon two other sort of people. Fust, thar wer all the rowdies, and blacklegs, and horse-jockies, that hung around the towns-they wer bound to vote fer him; but there wer a great many quiet, docious new comers-merchants, doc- tors, lawyers, preachers, and teachers, and land- hunters. Well, these new settlers wer mostly from the Yankee settlements, and didn't believe much in keerds, nor whiskey, nor rowdyism; and the Ginral's enemies rayther reckon'd ef they could   A HALF-BREED TAVERN.    15S show him up to them, they could lick him up like salt. Now Houston, whar the capitel wer then, wer fairly runnin' over with these new comers; and the Ginral's friends tried to keep him out of thar way, but t'warnt no sorter use. Up to town he would go, and when he got thar he kept on goin', tell he got as high as ninety. Some of the other party got scent of this, and sot out to find him, and trot him around town; but the Ginral, fur gone as he was, reckon'd he'd best go a heap further, and get clar outer the way. Thar wer an old Madam Mars, or some setch name, that hed been a leetle given to pisonin' and setch like amusements, and the Ginral hed saved her neck from bein' lengthened out; so they wer the greatest kind of friends. The Ginral made fer her cabin, and lucky he did, fer the party wer barkin' right piert on his trail. The old woman sighted 'em, and told the Ginral to get under the bed directly. Now, Madam Mars kep a kinder half breed tavern, part way betwixt an eatin' house and a boardin' house. Thar wer a smart chaince of Catin' and some little sleepin' done in it, and thar wer spread out on a table a big roast turkey and all sorts of fixins. The Ginral sot eyes on the    <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6605-00000080"/> 156 GTTING A TUIKEY ON--A "c GENERAL"HUNT. turkey, grabbed it, and ducked under the bed jest as the men come in. "Is the Ginral heah, madam?" asked one of the men. "Passed through jest this minit," says she. "Went out the back door into the lot. I couldn't think what made him in setch a hurry." To the back door they went, and found a man they'd been smart enough to send round that way. So seein' the Madam bed been stockin' the keerds on 'em, they begin to smell a bug. "Let's go in and hev dinner," ses one, and in they went. The Madam tried hard to get shut of 'em, but 'twouldn't do. She told 'em there'd been a fine fat turkey on the table, but a dog come in, stole it, and run off. "'Pears to me, madam," ses one; "'pears to me I kin hear him now under the bed, a growlin' and a crackin' the bones." "Oh no, sir," ses she, "I swept the room, under the bed and all, the minit afore you come in." I reckon you know, boys, what a powerful big bump of vanity the Ginral's got. I've hearn how many horse power it wer equal to, but sort of dis- remember; though they do say he's got enough to stock seventeen gals, nine madams, seven grass   THE ORIGINAL TURKEY.    167 widers, and five real ones. The boys that were arter him knew it, too. "He's heah," whispers one on 'em; "how'll we manage to trot him out?" "His bump of vanity's big as a base drum," ses another; " let's play on it." And so they did. One said he wouldn't dar to go home to his old woman, without seein' the great Ginral that allers licked the Mexikins to get an appetite fer breakfast. Another, that he'd come clar from Maine to see him. A third said that he wer bound to be next President of the United States; that the people would declare war on Texas, ef she wouldn't give him up to 'em; and at last a man said, you might put Washington, and Ginral Jackson, and Boneyparty, and Docter Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson into a kittle, and bile 'em down, and they all wouldn't make a man like the Ginral. The Ginral couldn't stand it no longer, and out he crawls, and a most powerful putty figger he cut. He stuck to his turkey, and gnawed away at it like a dog, holdin' it by the neck in one hand and the drumsticks in t'other; and without stop- pin' his eatin', ses he, "Gelmen-fu. wa see the Genl, he-is." They wer powerful glad to see him, and wanted to shake hands; but no, he wouldn't leave his turkey; then    <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6605-00000081"/> 158 GETTING A TURKEY ON-A ( GENERmALT HUT. they give him an invite to go out and licker; and out he'd hev gone, ondly the madam declared war, and with a knife in one hand and broom- stick in t'other, druv the strangers out. When they got back to the tavern, every one got round 'em, asking about the Ginral. "Whar is he?" "Hev you seen him?" "Why didn't you trot him out?" "Gentle-men," ses one on 'em, "we Ah seen the Gineral, and he's got a most owdacious big tr- key on. Ef they didn't trot the Ginral out they trotted the story round, mighty apt I tell ye. It did a smart chaince of damage, but didn't do quite enough."

Three legged Willie could outswear all the Mississippi steamboat mates put together, but in his wildest fits was never a priming to the General. The first time that I ever heard him, the whole affair was so excessively ludicrous and so extremely horrible that I shall never forget it. It was in this very room, and thus it came about. He had been sent for, to lead in the most im- portant case that ever was brought before our Dis. trict Court, or probably that ever will be. Half the negroes in this county had been run off from Alabama, and I have never blamed their owners for it.

After the affair lay dormant some years, the bank began to stir in it; sent an agent over to procure counsel, which he did with much diffl culty-although at a distance from here--and the next term the suit came on. The papers and record testimony had been prepared with the utmost care, and by the ablest counsel in Ala- bama; their counsel here were superior to those first engaged on the plaintiff's side; and although only one suit was brought, yet being a test ques- tion-involving perhaps a quarter of a million- the county was stirred up, and the settlers buzzed about, held meetings, made speeches, published threatening circulars, and in fact put me in mind of the amiable denizens of a hornet's nest, when their homestead has had a writ of ejectment served upon it in the shape of a long pole with a boy at the end. Well, our people being very patriotic, the Gen- eral was to lead, and his juniors were all gentle- men who had figured at some time in our army list. There was one colonel in the lot, but although   CHANGING FRONT.      161 worth all the rest put together, he was deemed a mere nobody. The General's practice had laid dormant so long that no one knew much about his legal abilities, but he was the General, and that was enough for his clients. The case came on, and in fifteen minutes after he commenced speaking, the Gene- ral had nearly ruined the cause. His coadjutors saw that something must be done, and managed to choke him off-how I never knew. Then another General arose, but he was completely in the fog-this not being his part-and he dawdled on until the court adjourned for dinner. At that time I occupied the small house on the other side of the yard. One or two of the junior counsel for the defendant came in, and with them Judge Franklin, the shrewdest and quickest wit- ted, if not the deepest lawyer in Texas. lie amu- sed himself first by proving how their cause could be defended to a certainty. HEis hearers drank it all in with thirsty ears, believed it all, and evi- dently intended to take the course laid down. Then Franklin changed front, undermined his own arguments, and showed very conclusively that there was not the slightest chance for the de- fene. Their countenances went down to zero in double-quick time. "    <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6605-00000083"/> 162    THE BIG BUCKSKIN BREECHEB. After looking at them a moment, Franklin burst into a loud laugh, and said- "Boys, if you had relied on yourselves, and not on the old grannies who lead you, you might have done something. I can throw that case out of court in fifteen minutes." The council had been fairly dazzled and bewil. dered by the brilliance of his rhetoric; they believed him immediately; left, had a consulta- tion with their seniors and the committee-who by this time had discovered that the defence would be safer in the hands of great lawyers, than in those of great generals-and the conse- quence was that Franklin received an invitation to lead. He consented, on the condition that he should not be tramelled or interfered with. This was a great triumph for him, as he was anything but popular with the bar, from his habit of completely identifying himself with his client's cause; grasp- ing at every legal advantage, holding on to every inch gained, and never showing mercy to dilatory or careless opponents. Hle was as good as his word. He calmly asked the court for a non-suit, upon the ground that the suit was brought by a nullity, said to be a corpo ration existing at one time in Alabama, but of whose existence or legal corporate powers not a   A FANCY RIG.      168 shadow of proof was furnished. The opposite counsel squabbled awhile, but were so taken aback by this sudden squall, that their craft became unmanageable-in fact they began to deem it unseaworthy. They boxed the compass without making a point, and Judge Norton sus- tained the non-suit. The case was afterwards carried up to the Su- preme Bench, and they sustained the decision of the lower court. So ended the Bank war. Now all this was not exactly nuts to the old General; and he would have been in a horrid hu- mor, but for one consolation, which was neither more nor less than a prospect of the speedy com- pletion of two pairs of magnificent buckskin breeches. You probably all know his peculiar style of rig -very heavy, old-fashioned, military jack-boots, yellow buckskin breeches, buff vest; coat, long tailed blue, with gilt buttons, huge white beaver, and an exceedingly fancy Mexican blanket, made to assume a different position at least once in five minutes. Of all this dress, an immaculate pair of buckskins called for his principal attention, and were the pride of his heart. Now, the very day of his arrival, he had disco- vered in a certain store some fine yellow buck- skins, very heavy, of superior quality, and admi-    <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6605-00000084"/> 164    THB BIG BUKBKI BREECES. rably dressed. He bought them instantly, and in a few minutes the crowd in the street were treated to a rare sight, the great general-at least six feet and a half in height-walking arm-in-arm, and conversing in his most mellifluous style, with a poor little duck-legged Dutch tailor, almost a dwarf, who might with very high-heeled boots have stood somewhere near four feet ten. What object the General had in his selection of this poor specimen of humanity I know not, unless he thought that such a display of urbanity would pay the bill. As for the little Dutchman, he appeared to be  fairly overwhelmed and desperately frightened, as well as excessively proud of the honor, and evi- dently seemed to think that his fortune was made, or if not, that after :this there was nothing more left to live for. The General escorted him down to the store, was there measured, and then escorted him back again, saw him mounted for home, shook hands warmly, and gave him a parting bow. The night after the upset of the great Bank case, I slept in that corner bed--having resigned my own room temporarily-and the General occu- pied one in the opposite corner. During the eve- ning he had been very good humored and talka- tive; but at its close, a long-legged, half-witted   A TIGHT rIT.      15 Alabamian had called in, and annoyed him ex-  ceedingly with some very pertinent and imperti- nent questions, a true solution of one of which the English and French Ministers in Mexico, and the invincible Santa Anna himself would have come down very heavy indeed to have obtained. In fact, he was regularly put through a new kind of catechism, and was asked, among other things, whether he had " got religion" and joined the Methodists; whether he had stopped drinking entirely; and last of all, whether he was in favor of annexation. I did not much wonder at his rising on the next morning with a clouded brow. His servant, who came in to dress him, met with more curses than coppers, but the storm did not fairly burst, until when at least two-thirds dressed, he discovered the new buckskins laying across the foot of his bed. Then he thundered in good earnest, and hurled all the expletives in the language, as I then supposed, at the poor boy's head, winding up with a six-shooter of an oath and an order to quit the room. Off went vest and off went pantaloons. He seized the buckskins with both hands, inserted his feet in the waisthands, and gave a gigantic tug. Alas I and alack-a-day I I don't think they were large enough for even the little tailor himself.    <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6605-00000085"/> 166    THE BIG BUCKSKIN BREECHES. They had been stretched to their utmost limits-by his violent pull; and there they were, half way on, and refusing to move an inch up or down; clinging in fact to his limbs with the tenacity of the Python to Laocoon. He tried to move, and fell sprawling on the bed; then he raised his voice aloud for his boy, and with his assistance was soon seated in a chair. The servant grasped the bottom of the breeches, and exerted his utmost strength; the breeches would not give an inch. "Stop, sir"-thundered out the General. "Do you go and stand there, sir-there, directly in front of me, while I curse you, sir." Such a torrent of imprecations as poured forth from his lips I have never heard before nor since, and never do I wish to, again. When he had fairly exhausted-himself and his oaths, he wound up the performance with a prayer. "And now, sir," said he, "1 pray to G--that he will convert you into a living statue; and be- ginning at your feet, with living fire will burn you up to the crown of your head, G- d- you, sir. Now pull my breeches off, sir." Having treated us to the disgusting and horri- ble, down town he marched, after breakfast, to give the crowd there a display of the ludicrous and ridiculous.   SHAKE, QUAVER, AND RUN.   167 The street was full, and a particularly large number clustered around the court-house. Among them the General looked for his quarry. Pre- sently he espied his little Dutch friend, and his little Dutch friend espied him. Now the Dutch- man, who expected nothing less than a league of land, as a present and reward from his noble patron, in order to be enabled to converse with, and conduct himself properly towards him, and moreover, to conquer the mauvais honte which so much afflicted him before, had taken occasion to introduce into his system an unusually large quan- tity of Dutch courage, and was now prepared to meet the General upon equal terms. He ad- vanced with cordial smile and extended hand. The General's hand was extended also, and you can imagine the poor tailor's feelings and fright, when, instead of a friendly greeting, the said hand grasped his collar, and nearly shook his soul out, and its proprietor poured down a perfect ava- lanche of curses upon his devoted head. The grasp was relaxed, and the little Dutch- man had started to run for his life, when the Gen- eral roared out- "Stop, sir! I've not done with you, sir. I'm going to have you hung, sir-higher than Haman, sir." Down dropped the tailor on his knees--he had.    <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6605-00000086"/> 168    THE BIG BUCKSKIN BREECHES. no doubt about the hanging-and begged for his life like a good fellow. "Life!"-thundered the General-" how dare you ask for your life, when you've spoiled two such pairs of buckskin breeches. Get up, sir; go in- stantly for the wretched abortions, sir; then march down to the store, sir, and pay for the skins you have ruined, sir. I'll give you ten minutes to do it in; and if I ever catch you in this town again you shall be hung, sir, before you've time to say your prayers, sir." Away ran the tailor, amid a running accompa- niment of laughter from the crowd. He carried off the breeches, but-probably being pressed for time-did not pay for the skins; which debt the General had the satisfaction of settling. The poor tailor was never seen in this town after that very night. He decamped, bag and baggage-the latter including his vrow-for the west."   CHAPTER XVII. THE BRIIDE ABRIDGED-AND THE PONS ASINORUM. "CoME, boys," exclaimed Uncle Billy, "I reckon we've had a right smart dose of this. I opened on the trail, but I'm done tired out, a hearin' the Ginral cussed and dis-cussed. I've hearn that he'd got religion, and come out straight as a rifle-barrel." "Agreed," said Milward.

Father wanted me to stick to the farm, and said edication would jest be ruination; but mother hung on so like all possessed that he had to give in about the schoolin', though he wouldn't about my beini' made a preacher on. There ain't no priest-timber in him, ses he. He's got a nation sight too much devilment in his hide for either min- ister or doctor, but it don't take much stuff to make a lawyer on, and if it's rufage, or shaky, or a scant pattern, it 'll do to get some kind of squire out on." And I guess the old man was more'n half right. Take the lawyers all together, and they put me amazinly in mind of a rail-road :-First, there's the sleepers, lazy fellers, allers a grovellin' in the dirt, and doin' the meanest work, and flat down on their-stomiks; and there they lie till they git rottin' and then they're kicked out, and pitched over mighty spry. Then come the string pieces-a peg above the sleepers-don't do quite so much dirty work, made of better timber, and a little more keerful dressed, but allers held down in their places by their superiors. Then comes the rails; there's good metal in them, they're the bar, do a mighty sight of work, and are kept amazin' bright ginrally, though now and then they get rusty, when there ain't enough bisness doin'; and   POLITICS AND PLATFORMS    171 sometimes turn ugly, and rise up snakes' heads, and play thunder with lives and propety trusted to 'em. Last of all is the great iron horse; he's the big bug-the Judge may-be-has a tender to help him, that's the clerk; allers carries weight; is sure to have a great crowd of folks that foller arter, and depend on him, and hangs on to lots of propety. When he runs off the track, or bursts up, the whole people know it, and it's in all the papers.' "A fair illustration, Sam," interrupted Mil- ward, "but what do you do with switches and switch tenders, engineers, and brakemen, and id omne genus?" "Why, them switches, squire, I take to be po- litikle ingines, and the tenders is the wire-pullers. The ingineers and brakemen, they're the great people, that fire up the ingine when it's goin' too slow, and hold it in when it's goin' too fast. Last of all, there's the platforms, allers a gittin' old and rotten, and wantin' new planks! Some folks get out on one, and some on another, and some make it a pint to try evry platform on the hull road, ef they kin git a chance. Well, this isn't gittin' ahead with my story, not by a jug-full; so here goes. I was sent to Primville academy-they didn't have institutes in them days-and as there wasn't    <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6605-00000088"/> 172     THE BRIDGE ABRIDGED. any boardin' house to it, the boys was scattered- putty much all over town. I stopped with Doc- tor Lovejoy, though father wanted to get me in at the principal's, but he was full. "Now, Jed," says he, when he left me, "you'll be mixed up with all kinds of boys; try and pick out good companions; don't be meanr, but don't throw your money away;" (he had been liberal to me, that's a fact,) "hold yer head up with the best of'em; and though I ain't much faith in yer bein' a genus, try yer best, and may-be ye'll dis- tinguish yerself-who knows?" I did-I distinguished myself afore the week was out, and had did consideble towards it the first day. The boys had just lost their leader; e'd distinguished himself, and got leave to stay to hum at the eend of the last term. Now I do cal'late I was jest about as full of it when I was a boy, as the next one anywhere, and though green as a punkin, yet the others was city raised, and not quite up to country tricks, and somehow I stepped right into the leader's empty shoes as slick as grease. There was a good many apples missin' in the principal's orchard, and quite a pile'stowed away in the Doctor's garret, the first night. The next, I diskivered a way of gettin' out of our room win-   h SUMMARY"PROCEEDINGS OF MRS. c WINTER.' 173 tery. There wasn't as many punkin pies, by two, found next mornin', and a plate of doughnuts was among the missin'. The Doctor's folks didn't say nothin', but there was a curus piece of slit-work nailed up to the buttery winder next day, and the supply of pies and doughnuts was cut off. I found the boys was dredful ignorant; didn't know nothin' about rabbit twich-ups, nor pat- ridge snares. So I took up teachin', and it's asto- nishin' how quick they larnt. The swamp was a full mile off, and as we had to takea squint at our snares right after breakfast, consequence was, when the bell rung not half the boys was in the academy. 'Twasn't long afore they found out who showed the boys how to set snares; then my troubles begun, and the boys who wasn't in their seats at the right time was put through a certin exercise, that made settin' down plaguy uneasy the rest of the day. I'd had some consideble practice in smokin' native segars, so I interduced the fashion, and it spread amazinly. One night the Docter's boys went over to see Winter's boys. Winter was the principal. I treated to segars, and we was a puf- fin' away like steam-ingins. when the door opens, and in come Miss Winter. She was a regler vine- gar bottle, the boys was feared to death on her. ,] 1 , j ... y    <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6605-00000089"/> }174    THE BRIDGE ABRIDGED. Ses she, "'Young gentleman, smokin' is not allowed here, but when you want to smoke please to walk down in my parler, you and your friends." And out she went. It was prayer-meetin' night, and the folks allers attended. So I cut out, and traded for a big lot of segars, down we went inter the parler-that never saw light onst a month-and we soon had it so full of smoke you could'nt see acrost the room. Bimeby the folks got back, and as Miss Winter passed the door, I could hear her snuff her nose, and say, "' Smoke for certin. Them wretches has been at it agin." And up stairs she bolted, but there wasn't any smoke there. Over the house she went, inter every room but ours ; then down cel- lar. At last our door opened; and the nation! if I ever saw a woman bilin' over, it was her. She ketched up a shovel and fetched one of the boys a "spang" with the flat of it, and laid him out putty straight. The old man run in badly scared, catched hold on her, jerk'd the shovel away, and picked up the boy, who wasn't hurt much arter all, but was smart enough to play possum; and when he got ready, come to, and grunted and groaned dreadful. "Now flat the boy has recovered, and there's I ; I   MSCHEF AFOOT.      175 no serus mischief done," ses Winter, "I'd jest like to know what possess'd you to come into my best room and defile it with filthy smoke."' "I told the rascals to," ses his wife, " but hadn't any idee they'd have impedence enough to do it." "This is a bad business," ses he, "but under the circumstances I shall pass it over, and let his pun- ishment-pintin' to the boy with his head broke -answer for all. I hope you'll take warnin' by this, of the danger of such pranks;, and now, you that belong here retire to your rooms, and you that do not, to your respective homes." If it hadn't been for that lick with the shovel wouldn't we have ketch'd it, though. There was two depity masters, one of 'em a rale bunkum chap, that the bovs all liked and minded, and t'other a cross-grained, ugly critter, that was allers a pickin' a hole in the boy's coats. We'd kept a sharp look out for a chance' to pay him off, and at last it come. There was a law that no teacher ner boy should go more'n a mile from the academy without informin' the principal, exceptin' on our two half holidays. Now, some on us found out that Dolit- tle-that was the cross one-used to go off a sparkin' most every night, and sneak off through the fields, arter dark. l         .        4 i       0.

One chilly night, arter dark, a boy saw him makin' a straight coat-tail for the brook, and we got all ready for him. Ten o'clock come, and four on us sneaked out, pesky quiet, and lined it for the bridge. The time was beautiful for our fun and no mistake; the sky had all clouded over, and one of them nasty Scotch mists was a fallin'. We took off four of the middle planks of the bridge, and then hid away in the bushes by the brook, and it wasn't long afore we heard his long legs and big feet a comin'. Tramp, tramp, tramp-and then kersouse he went into the mud and water. Didn't he holler? and when he crawled out, maybe he didn't swear like a trooper. We kept monstrous still, for the only danger we was in was of gettin' a lickin' on the spot. We knew the critter dasent make any fnss in school about it. I tell ye we give him a wide berth and a chance to get most hum, afore we started off another waysgt to our house, and crawled onto the shed and inter the winder. Didn't we laugh then though-woke up the hull house, and the Docter came up to see what was to pay; but he found us all asleep and a snorin'.

He suspicioned me from the first, and plagued me most to death with his lessons. I was dread- ful backward, couldn't make head ner tail of grammar, and didn't take to nothin' but 'rithme- tic, and so, to bother me about cipherin', the skunk set me to work on algebry-there I got stalled right off. One day ses he to me, right loud, too, afore the hull school-- "You're a putty feller to train for college, Jed- ediah-can't do a sum in algebry, not in simple addition; what'll you do in jometry? Do you ever think you'll get over the asses bridge?" I blazed right out, and ses I, "not if you was to take of the middle planks, mister." The fat was all in the fire, and I'd made an inimy for life, and 't wasn't long afore I felt him too; for Mr. Winter was took sick, and went to the shore, and Dolittle was left head master. The term was most done, and I went so mighty straight that he couldn't get ary hold on me; but when ite last night come, the boys that wasn't comin' back set out to do a leetle job they'd plan- ned long ago-togive the tithing man a benefit-, 12                    , . v     <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6605-00000091"/> 78      THE BRIDGE ABRIDGED. and the old Nick put it into my head to go 'long with 'em. We raised a bang up tin-kettle and cow-horn band, and -played away beautiful. That didn't seem to worry him; and as there was a big stun heap clus by, we thought we'd jest try what virtu was in 'em,-as the spellin'-book says. Bang went one volley agin the winders. There was a stirrin' in the house then, I guess; and jest as bang went number two, a winder was jerked up and whang went an old musket slap at us, and we peeled it  for hum as if the old sarpent was behind. Next mornin' we was all ready for the stages, when long comes a constable and takes us all up, and if we didn't feel mean it's a pity. Old Squire Middleton, a lawyer, heard of it, and come right over to the Justice's, and bailed ns -all out. Then he took the biggest boy with hig, and tellin' us to keep together, and not go away fur off, they two went together. In half an hour back they come, and the squire went up to the justice as bold as a lion, and called for our discharge. "On what grounds, Mr. Middleton?" asked the justice. "Because, sir, this young gentleman has settled with the complainant, which clears the hull party.

Boys, you're discharged, and don't let me ketch you here agin." I went hum in the stage that day, and had a feller passenger I didn't know on--a letter to my father from Dolittle-and in it was a full and per- tickler account-as the papers say-of \all my scrapes, and a good many more I'd never thought on. Father never let on till next day; and then invited me to the barn; and when we was fairly inside, he pulls out the letter, and ses he, "My son, the teacher writes that your head's too thick to hold anythin' but mischief, and is not impressible. Now I'm goin' to try whether t'other eend is er not." He give me the awfullest quiltin' I ever had in my born days. And that's the way, Mr. Milward, that I lost my liberal edication."

"As our friend, Sam Slick, here," commenced Milward, "has been so free with his experience, I feel it rather a duty to impart a few of my confes- sions, for his benefit and that of the company. My first appearance in New Orleans was in the early part of '36, and just after the news of the fall of the Alarno reached that city. New Or- leans was never particularly noted for the equable temperance of its inhabitants; and this news fol- lowing close upon the heels of the infamous mas- sacre of Fannin' and his men, and Santa Anna's bombastic and exceedingly Mexican proclamation, in which he announced that "he was on his way to exterminate every Texan, and that he would carry his victorious flag across the Sabine, and plant it in Washington,"-made the inhabitants about as amiable and peaceably inclined as a she bear, who has just lost her cubs. Meetings were held, men raised and armed, ves. sels fitted out, money subscribed and collected-- 181    <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6605-00000093"/> 182 '36 AND '42--AN IVITrATION To A FROM. all done openly and above board. No talk of "filibustering" then, or of stopping recruits, but the meetings were held in the most public places, and the calls for men were posted in flaming handbills all over the city. To cap the climax, poor old General Gaines took fire in a moment, and without waiting for any orders from head-quarters, drew off the Uni. ted States troops from New Orleans and Baton Rouge; put up his handbills calling for volun. teers, and with all the men at hand, off he started for Texas--leaving orders for the volunteers to follow--steamed it up the Red River, and not only marched his little army to the frontier, but absolutely crossed it, and advanced an hundred miles into the Mexican territory, to meet the inso- lent foe. For all this, I believe he did not receive even a reprimand. Those days--as you are aware-were very different from the present times of quick communication; there was no telegraph at work, and if there had been I do not believe that it would have made any difference in the old war- rior's movements. If there ever was a truly chivalrous officer in our army; if there ever was a man perfectly idol' ized by the South, it was he. At this time he had just returned from his most disastrous cam- A;   IND'EPENDENT VOLUNTEERS.   183 paign in Florida, and we would have supposed that the results of flying directly in the face and eyes of all authority, would have satisfied him for a while, but before, he had time even to receive an official rap on the knuckles for one escapade, off he bolts upon another." "What previous affair do you refer to, Mr. Mil- ward?" interrupted Dr. Allen. "To his scrape," continued Milward,/" in the late Seminole war. When it was found that the Indians were not to be subdued by any such force as could be raised on the spot, the government despatched General Scott to collect an army of volunteers in South Carolina, Gedrgia, Alabama and Louisiana. The general went in person to Charleston, Savannah, Augusta, Milledgeville and Macon, to superintend the embarkation of the troops; but the Alabama men rendezvoused at Mobile, and both they and the New Orleans vol- unteers refused to move a peg under any other commander than Gaines, whose command truly covered the seat of war and the States where the army was raised, and he at that time was Scott's senior officer. Gaines, terribly irritated at being superseded as it were, by Scott, did not require much persua- sion to take the command. The troops were but volunteers, after all, and could not be forced to    <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6605-00000094"/> 184 '36 AND 42-AN INVITATION TO A FROLIC. leave their own State and wage war upon the soil of any other; so that the general had at least some show of reason for his conduct; but, as the result proved, it would have been infinitely wiser to have disbanded these men, and sent them home. Gaines marched his small force as far as the Withlacooche, and there the Indians met and sur- rounded him. He was forced to camp, build a fort, and lay still, and at last-the worst and un- kindest cut of all to the poor general-he had to despatch a messenger to Scott, to hasten to his aid; and Scott, abandoning his plan of the cam- paign, returned to help him out of the scrape. In this manner the whole campaign was in fact frustrated, and rendered worse than useless; it injured the morale of our men, and gave the sava- ges encouragement to protract the war, as they did for three years; and I believe upon my word, if Colonel Harney had not adopted the very hu- mane plan of hanging every Indian that he could i  lay hands upon, they would be at it yet." "Something similar," said I, "to Colonel Wood's plan for terminating the Mexican war. After the taking of Monterey he returned to Houston, and there, in compliance with the ,i  request of the citizens, delivered a lecture upon the Mexican war: in which, after describing the   NEWS OF VICTORY.     185 very charitable system adopted with regard to our enemies, said there was but one practicable way to terminate the war, and that was, whenever you saw a Mexican to shoot him. Harney, whenever he caught an Indian, hung him-a plan, however objectionable on the score of humanity, that pro- ved remarkably successful in its results." "The entire southwest," continued Milward, "was up and arming. I left New Orleans on the morning the report of San Jacinto fight had been received. I was bound for Port Gibson, and chanced to be the first who carried the joyful news to that place. I arrived just at the close of a meeting of planters and merchants, who had instantly raised the necessary funds for sending a full company of volunteers for Texas, and the ranks had been filled up in half an hour. I told them that they were too late, the thing was done, the child born and christened-and his name was Sam, I might have added; although, when I think of it, it was called "Rusk" in 'those days- that the fight was fought and the battle won, Santa Anna and Cos prisoners, and Texas free. Of course there was an universal shout at the news; but to have looked at the volunteers, you would have supposed that some terrible disaster had befallen the Texan arms, instead of the achievement of a great victory. They were-as    <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6605-00000095"/> 186 '36 AD '42-AN INVITATION TO A FROLIC. they termed it-fairly froze for a fight; and one poor fellow sat down, and cried like a child. Many refused to believe it, and I was certainly the most unpopular man in town. The enthusiasm of these fire-eaters was infec- tious, and then I experienced the first symptoms of the Texas fever. The next spring another grand invasion was threaten'd, and another call for volunteers went forth. Things did not work so easily, however; money and men came in sparingly. New Orleans was flooded with recruiting officers, and I obtained a commission and went to work. Before our respective corps were completed, the affair was over; there was to be no fighting after all. The men and most of the officers went on. I did not. A campaign was what I wanted, not the routine of camp duty-living on prairie beef with- out salt, with no amusement, save the quarrels of the men over a game of poker, or the duels of the officers, founded upon some point of precedence, or imaginary honor. So I resigned, and staid at home. In the spring of '42 I had another, and perhaps I might say a fatal attack of the disease. It cer- tainly carried the patient off. Sam Houston, in a flaming proclamation to all the world and the rest of mankind, declared his intention of revelling in   THE COW DRIVERS.      187 the halls of the Montezumas; and those who knew him had no doubt of the 'revelling' part of the business, if he could only once get in. He very hospitably invited ten thousand gentleme from the States to join in the frolic.  Whether or not, the distinguis h General was revelling himself at the time of this liberal issue of cards for a select party, is yet a mooted point. Perhaps he only wanted to create a sensation, and to allay the Western irritation caused by his suppression of the "Cow-drivers," who would certainly have conquered Mexico, if let alone. The border foragers in the good old times of English and Scottish warfare were nothing to these men. They formed in companies, rendezvoused at Bexar, crossed the Rio Grande, and drove off every hoof they met with. Every man was pro- vided with rifle, bowie knife, a belt full of pistols and a spare horse or two. If the party was small, a caviarde of horses would be staked out and left perhaps sixty miles from the field of their intended operations; another, some thirty miles further on, and a man dropped to look after each drove. This was done, so that if sharply pursued, they might have fresh horses at hand to escape-with their booty, if they could; without it, if they must.    <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6605-00000096"/> 188 '36 AND '42--A INVITATION TO A FROLIO. They carried things at last very far indeed-in fact as far as Metamoras, and a large and daring company of, men absolutely drove off a caviarde of horses, in sight of the eyes and under the noses of their cowardly foes. Arriving at Bexar, the men usually quarter'd in the old church of the Alamo, sent for a barrel of whiskey, knocked the head in, built a camp fire on the stone floor, and kept open house while the  whiskey lasted, which was usually until near morning. The next day their booty was disposed of, generally at auction; all the fine horses bring- ing large prices. A few days of frolic by day, and poker and fandango by night-with depleted pockets, and their old thirst for adventure urging them on-off they would go on a new expedition, generally with recruited numbers. This system worked admirably, and while it lasted San Antonio de Bexar was decidedly the greatest place out of jail. The speculators and merchants bought the cattle and horses for money, which was sure to be left in town, all ready for the next drove. The Cow-drivers increased rapidly, in numbers, skill, and daring. Banded together, they could have swept the valley of the Rio Grande. From being a great annoyance to the enemy, they had   ARRIVAL OF THE GUESTS.    189 grown into an imminent danger. There was no telling how soon they might take it into their au- dacious heads to combine and sack Mier or even Metamoras; and so, according to Houston's policy, they must be suppressed. What this policy was, it is difficult to deter- mine; the result was easy to be seen-the depopu- lation and ruin of the West. The cause was the difficulty, and the people were divided in their opinion, some supposing that he acted under the golden rule, of returning good for evil, and ab- stained carefully from inflicting any injury upon our enemies; others asserting that he feared some military exploit might obscure the glory of the one of San Jacinto. I will return to his proclamation. Probably to his surprise, the guests began to arrive in rather troublesome numbers. No less a personage than an ex-governor of a leading southern State turned out, and raised a regiment; Congress met, gave Houston full powers to push on the invasion, opened their treasury, which didn't amount to much, and granted ten millions of acres of land, which amounted to more. For the system of fighting pursued by the Tex- ans however, but little was required. The men simply wanted ammunition, provisions, and a chance to fight. If necessary, they could and    <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6605-00000097"/> 190 '36 AND '42-- INVITATION TO A FROIa. generally did find these themselves; carrying their own powder and ball; fighting with their own rifles, and riding their own horses; and for food, prairie beef, to which they helped them. selves. As for artillery, every attempt made with it proved its inutility, and the certainty of its impe- ding operations. What then prevented a campaign, at least to sweep the valley of the Rio Grande? It could have been conducted without one dollar, if ne. cessary. What then prevented it? Houston's policy." The guests arrived; the war-spirit of the whole republic was aroused. Congress urged on the measure, and-Houston vetoed the bill. He fired the train, and then threw a bucket of cold water upon it. In fact, acted like a boy, who, stumbling upon some book of Gramarye, has, to his utter amazement raised the devil, and don't know how the deuce to lay him. Sam's devil has not been laid yet; during the fall of '42 he raged so fiercely in the West that an universal execration went forth, coupled with threats, which were certainly in bad taste, and doubtless would not have been carried into effect even had the opportunity offered, although Houston once   UNCLE BILLY'S OPINION.    191 deemed it expedient to evacuate Galveston in a hurry. As I was saying, in the spring of this said year I took the fever; in the early part of summer it ' carried me off. A large number of volunteers lay in New Orleans, and the only practicable mode of transportation was the steamer "Zavalla." After waiting a month, she took off half our company. The officers remained with the other half. As the steamer was to undergo repairs, it would certainly be another month before we could be removed. Something must be done. Our military chest was nonest-the men wearing out their clothes and getting into all sorts of scrapes. Such a set of rapscallions no mortal hath seen before; soldiers every man of them, and most of them had seen service. No company had hitherto marched across coun. try to Houston, but some one must be the first in doing everything, and we determined to try it." "Texas mout hev gone to thunder, afore I'd hev did it," interrupted Uncle Billy, whose sleepy fit had left him, and who had been paying great attention to Milward's story.    <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6605-00000098"/> CHAPTER XIX. THE FAN-TAILED STEAMER-A FAST CRAB. "N full sight of all who walked upon the Levee," resumed Milward, "lay the Texan fleet, thoroughly repaired, armed, manned and equip- ped; two vessels-the sloop of war Austin and gun-brig Wharton. They could have carried every volunteer over with perfect ease; but the fleet under the command of Commodore More- a better and braver sailor than whom never walked the quarter deck-was the very thorniest of all thorns in the Mexican sides. Houston could not keep More from fighting, whenever there was a chance, and so it was part of Houston's policy to destroy the fleet. His plan to do this was good, decidedly; but More was one too many for him, and some more to boots Hous- ton sent the fleet to New Orleans for repairs, and having run them in debt, no money was forth- coming to release them from it. The fleet was represented to Congress as a great and useless 192   PROSPECTS OF A FIGHT.    193 expense, and just after the time that Mexico de- clared all the ports of Texas under blockade, three commissioners were sent to New Orleans to sell the fleet. More had friends in camp, and got wind of the matter; but before this occurred, the Yucatan troubles had culminated. Houston's friend, Santa Anna, determined that free they should not be, any how, and so sent an army-respectable as far as numbers went-to invest the capital by land, and a fleet, comprising two large war steamers, the "Montezuma" and the "Guadaloupe"--fur- nished by John Bull on credit, intended for our benefit, and partly officered by Englishmen-and several sailing vessels, to assail it by sea. Lorenzo de Zavalla, the son of our first-Vice President, and the son-in-law of the Governor of Yucatan, hastened to New Orleans with a long purse. He offered to pay all bills already incur- red, and furnish all necessary funds, if More would go down the coast and treat the new frigates and the fleet generally to a little Yankee thunder. More jumped at the offer; it suited him exactly, and was perfectly in his line of duty. All neces- sary preparations were hurried up, and the fleet on the eve of sailing, when the commissioners came. The board arrived; the chairman,Colonel Mor- 13    <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6605-00000099"/> 194 THE FAN-TAILED STEAMER-A FAST CRAB.  gan, of New Washington, took boat, and boarded the Austin, where More was walking the deck and looking out for him. Morgan was invited into the cabin, and there More immediately told him that he knew his purpose, but requested if he had any papers in his pocket that he would keep them there for the present. He represented the disgrace that would inevitably fall upon Texas should the compact with her ally, Yucatan, not be fulfilled; that a fortnight would be sufficient for its performance; that Texas would reap a pecu. niary benefit from it, and that finally Morgan should accompany him, share the glory, and as soon as the affair was over, the vessels should be delivered up. To all this Colonel Morgan agreed. The fleet sailed immediately, and on their voy age an episode occurred, which is well worthy of being mentioned. While laying'at New Or- leans, More discovered that a mutiny and planfor the seizure of his ship was on foot. Before the vessels reached the Balize six ringleaders were tried, condemned, and, as soon as the "Austin" was fairly at sea, hung from the yard-arm. This was at the very time of the attempted mutinieson the United States brig "Somers" and the sloop of war "John Adams." The Texan armed schooner "San Antonio," then at sea, was never more heard from, and I have not the least doubt of the exist   TIE M XICANS OATOH TT.    195 ence of a deep-laid plan for the seizure of enough armed vessels to form a formidable piratical fleet. I More went to Yucatan, sought the acquaintance of the Mexican frigates, and an introduction to their heavy Paixhan guns. An interview was speedily granted. It did not prove satisfactory to the Mexicans, who, after being wofully banged about for an hour or two-the wind dying away- made their escape, frigates, brigs, and all, and were not to be seen again upon any terms, while More was about. On land the Mexicans were even more unfortu- nate. The Yucatanese Indians had promised their assistance, if the Mexicans should invade the State. One fine morning a body of a thousand arrived. The chief called upon the governor, merely to inquire where the Mexicans could be found. The governor requested them to take one day to recruit, and then join his forces in a pitched battle. Now, the chief would not hear of recruiting. They had left home to be absent three days. One day to come, one day to whip the Mexicans, and one day to return; and they had taken but three days' provisions. What number of -men should he send with    <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6605-00000100"/> 196 THE FA-TAILED STEAM R-A FAST CRAB. them, and what arms and ammunition did they require  None; nothing; they would fight alone and in their own way. Each man had his own large cane-knife, and wanted nothing else, except to know where the Mexicans were. These last-mentioned heroes lay at a little town some three miles distant, and were not expecting so unceremonious a morning call. To their camp the governor politely convoyed the Indians, and the latter incontinently 'pitched in'-as the New York boys say-and in a very few minutes the braves of the central government over three thousand in number-were com- pletely used up, cannon taken, and everything else that they could not carry off in their hasty flight. Put your Mexican on horseback, and he will cavort with the best, become quite troublesome with his ugly lance, even blaze away considerably with his escopete-at least until some one drops- and then he's off! Plant him behind a safe wall, and he will shoot you a cannon as well as the next man; but never trust him at close quarters, where bayonets and bowie knives are in fashion. lHe can't stand it, and will not. Perhaps, like the Frenchman, he may be ticklish, and does not like to have sharp things pointed at him. -i   WORKING OUR PASSAGE.     197 Well, well, this will not do; if I can't rein in my horses, I shall never get to Texas, to say noth- ing of my telling you old news, and not so very old either, but that you must be all pretty well acquainted with it." "No, no," interrupted Roberts, "talk :it right out my son. Uncle Billy likes it. We're most on us knowin' to part on't, but there's a heap that's new. Don't go to holdin' in your critters on our account." "The Red River," continued Milward, "at this time was exceedingly low, and there was scarcely any water on the falls at Alexandria. The steam- boats up for that river were consequently few and far between. Some one, however, bought one of those queer up-river boats, apparently built to run across country on a heavy dew-drawing seven or eight inches light, and eighteen to twenty-four when loaded-and put up bills for the upper Red River ports, promising to work up to Caddo Prai- rie. The owner went as captain. The price of freight was enormous-three or four dollars per barrel. On this craft we shipped. We were to work our passage; the officers assisting as clerks; the men as deck hands and firemen. Our intention was to run up to Natchitoches-where 1 expected to receive quite a sum of money, due me from    <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6605-00000101"/> 198 THE FAN-TALD STEAMB  -A FAST ORAB. one of the regular boats-to buy baggage horses, or pack mules, and to set out on foot for the ren. dezvous at Austin, via Nacogdoches. Before starting, we' took an account of stock. All told, it amounted to one captain, Prime; two lieutenants, Higgins and myself; twenty-one rank and file; three dollars in actual cash; two barrels of smoked shoulders; two ditto pilot bread;  limited quantity of coffee, sugar and tobacco, and two sacks of Liverpool salt-the last being a pur- chase of our captain's, who began thus early to show his fitness for leading a body of men on a long foot march of nearly a thousand miles. Our funds were dissipated before we had fairly lost sight of the city. I had gone on board with the men, and was so busy with my assumed duties of clerk, that when we left I had not noticed the absence of Captain Prime and Lieutenant lig- gins. Absent, however, they were, and at that very moment figuring away at the St. Charles, participating in a small revel, probably anticipa- tory of the extensive one they were to enjoy when their feet should be once fairly within the doors, and their legs under the mahogany of the halls of the Montezumas. Our boat was built rather for service than either beauty or speed. Scow-bottomed, stern- wtieeled, two-boilered, with an engine of, I should   A RACE-LEGS VS. PADDLES.   199 think, near the power of nine horses and one yearling colt, it was at first rather a mooted point whether the boat would take us up the Missis- sippi, or the Mississippi should take us down to the Balize. Our engineer was, however, a deter- mined man. He ordered half a pound of rosin and a small pine knot to be thrown into each fur- nace. We began to propel and soon gained a speed .of two or three miles an hour. We had wriggled along a little above Carrolton,. and the shades of night were closing around, whei a shout from the bank called our attention to two bodies, two pairs of swiftly moving legs, and four arms extended aloft, waving two hats that evidently belonged 'to the heads attached to the aforesaid bodies, We neared the bank, and were hailed by our two delinquents. "Mechanic ahoy! Take us aboard." * "Can't stop," replies captain. "Push along, keep movin'; we'll wood afore midnight, and per- haps it mout be on your side the drink." Our foot passengers begged hard, and promised sums of money, utterly impossible-to them-but the captain determined to make them sweat for their negligence; and on we went for half an hour longer. Our men, who enjoyed the fun at first, began to be surly, for they knew that Prime had important    <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6605-00000102"/> 200 THE FAN-TAILED STEAMER-- FAST CRAB. letters to Houston, and that the manner of our reception would depend very much upon them. So the captain deemed it safest to stop and pick up our two estrays. Those two gentlemen had emptied our military chest, in paying a cabman to  take them up the Levee, in pursuit of the boat. For the three dollars, he drove them at full speed as far as Carrolton, but would not go a step fur- ther; so discharging his cargo, left them to follow the boat on their own legs if they chose. Having taken them on board, we again wriggled on our way rejoicing. After a due time-say ten. days or a fortnight-we arrived at Alexandria; and here nothing but bad news met us. The boat that was indebted to me was reported to be sunk in the Bon Dieu, or Bonjee, as they called it; the water on the falls would not have floated a skiff, and we were forced to change somewhat the order of our going-in fact, instead of the Nacogdoches road, to take the route to the second ferry on the Sabine; and then, via Jasper, Bevilport, and Swartwout, to Houston.  We first marched to the Market-place, but evacuated it, on finding one of the meat tables-- the market was over for the day-occupied by rather a rough customer, who had just been dis- charged from a steamer, under the idea that his general health was not good, and that he. was   QIrrE OUT UP,      201 slightly troubled with the yellow fever; So the boatman took up his bed and board-made of three-inch plank-at the Market Hotel.  He wanted no help, did not feel much sick, and ex- pected to get over it by night. He did get entirely over it; in four hours had quit this trou- blesome sphere, and was neatly dissected where he lay; most of our privates witnessing the ope- ration. We camped down a short distance from town; and here five of our men left us-to rendezvous at Houston-under the idea that the company was too large, and the prospect of feeding it too small. We could exert no authority over them, and it proved in the end that they were right about the commissariat. Next morning we converted our two bags of salt into money, divided the remainder of our ba- con, biscuits, coffee, sugar, and tobacco impar- tially; hired two negroes, who were driving re- turning cotton wagons, to carry our baggage and arms, some thirty miles on our route--for which service a pair of old breeches was transferred to our sable Jehus. At noon we took up our line of march, travelled fifteen miles, and camped. We were now on the immense unbroken forest, that stretches from the Red River to some distance on this side of the Trinity. We entered it immedi-    <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6605-00000103"/> 202 THE FAN-TAILED STEAMER-A FAST CRAB. ately after leaving Alexandria, and did not emerge from it until some twenty days after. All hands evidently enjoyed our first night in the wilderness. We had enough provisions for that night and the next day, and trusted to luck for the future. We fried our bacon, made our coffee-each in his own tin cup-piled the logs upon our camp-fire, and supper over, smoked our pipes in peace and happiness, while our orderly gave us a number of excellent songs. In fact, his repertoire was highly respectable; he had picked it up when he trod the Arch-street boards as walking gentleman. We turned in, all but the guard, as contented as men can be, far away from friends and home, bound upon a desperate wild-goose chase, and camped in a wild forest. Ini spite of this, we had before morning a most precious row." "Hold up a minit," said Roberts; "hold up a minit, and get your wind, afore you norate that. I'm bound to hev it all talked out straight."   CHAPTER XX. DEBIL IN DE CORN FIELD-RUN BOYS, RUN., Oua captain was naturally as good a fellow as ever breathed, but his knowledge of a new coun- try, and of the way to manage volunteers was ex- tremely limited. He was a capital drill-officer, and would have made a regular Martinet, if the men had permitted it. He had also, what was rather singular for a man of undoubted courage, a nervous dread for " varmints" of all kinds, from the spiteful wild-cat to the prowling panther; wolves were his abomination, and alligators his especial dread. "Lieutenant Higgins"-said he, after supper- "you will be officer of the night; detail four of the men; two to mount guard now, to be relieved at one o'clock by the others." Lieutenant Higgins touched his cap, and sub- mitted, as usual. He was in fact the captain's shadow, and about as well fitted for a command of volunteers. "What under Heaven do you want to set a guard for, captain!"I asked. 203    <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6605-00000104"/> 204 DEBIL IN DE CORN FIELD-RUN BOYS, RUN. "Why, sir, there may be Indians prowling about." "Indians! Indians trouble us within fifteen miles of Alexandria?" "Well, there may be negroes in the woods, who knows a" "Not a plantation in three miles, the drivers told me. And much they'd rob us of, even if they could find us all asleep." "The wolves, sir, are numerous in these forests, and sure to be attracted by our camp fires." "Sure to give them a wide berth; and if they didn't, a southern wolf is as-harmless to man as a cosset lamb." "Camp duty, sir, must be learned, and there is no better time t!n now." Upon that ground I could say nothing, but ad- vised him to be very cautious how he gave orders that would annoy the men, for we held them by a very uncertain tenure, and also to be firm in insisting upon their execution, when once given. I threw myself, wrapped in my blanket, on the ground, but did not sleep; and it was not long before I noticed that something was going on among a part of our squad. It was near midnight when I observed some five or six quietly steal into the bush, but it was none of my business, and so I said nothing. Soon after   A ROW IN THE AMP.     205 this I fell asleep, and must have remained so for an hour or more, when I was suddenly aroused by some one shaking me. I jumped up, and there were the captain and Higgins. What's the matter?"I asked. "Matter!" replied the captain, "here are four of our fellows have got drunk on whiskey, bought somehow from the negroes, and are in an awful fight. Some have drawn their knives, and we shall have all the rest up and into it, and half of them cut to pieces before we know it." I listened, and if noise and swearing be any criterion, there was a row on foot in earnest. "Order them to their quarters," said I. "Order be hung," answered the captain; "I did order them, and they laughed at me." "And at me, too," chimed in Higgins. "What do you want me to do .?" asked I. "Stop them if you can!" answered Prime. "I will try it," said I, "if you will remain here." I instantly aroused four of our best men, bade them take musket and cartridge box and follow me. In the middle of the road, a short distance from camp, were the gentlemen; two of them clenched, and two standing facing each other, with flashing    <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6605-00000105"/> 206 DEBIL IN DE CORN FIELD-- UN BOYS BRUN. eyes and drawn knives gleaming in the bright moon-beams. "They did not notice us, so I walked close up to them, and roared out in a voice that a bull of Bashan might have envied: "Back to your quartets this instant, you scoun- drels." The two who were engaged in pulling hair gave up in a moment; the knife gentlemen sim. ply stood where they were, made no demonstra. tion upon each other, and pretended to payno attention to us. "Boys," said I, "we have risked everything upon this expedition; it shall not be broken up. Be it in Texas, or be it in Louisiana, this sort of thing shall be stopped; and if you must needs throw away your lives, so be it." I formed my small squad, made them load by the twelve commands, winding up by, Shoulder arms! Present! Ready! Aim t "Now," said I "I shall count three, and then fire. If you choose to throw down your weapons in time, well and good; if not, you are dead men." "I drew my pistol, cocked and presented it, then counted one! two! three! Down went the knives, and forward came the men. The bright musket barrels, and the matter   TIED NECK AND HEELS.     207 of fact way in which the men went through their manoeuvres, proved too much for their nerves. We marched them to the camp, and bound them hand and foot. As for the two who first submitted, their hands alone were secured. Hav- ing set a guard over them, I again went to my blanket, and slept until morning. After this, du- ring our entire march, I never had the least diffi- culty with a private; in no instance did they ever refuse to obey my orders, which were few and necessary; and in no instance did they ever obey the captain or Higgins, unless it perfectly suited them to do so. Our next night was marked by a singular adventure. We had camped near an immense corn-field. Our provisions were running short, and the men plainly announced their intention of helping themselves. The corn crops of this part of Louisiana are very poor, and few families raise as much as they really need for bread. The natural result of this is, that before the corn is fairly blistered, the old stock is gone, and the field is searched for ears that are anything near fit for the table. Those who have a little old corn are as chary of it as if it were gold; and at the time of which I am speaking, although corn was selling in New Orleans at twenty-nine cents per bushel, here the    <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6605-00000106"/> 208 DEBIL IN DE CORN FIELD--RUN BOYS RUN. price, when any could be obtained, was three dollars. I knew perfectly well that our men-promise as they might-would most of them find their way into the field before morning; that as buts few ears were fit to be eaten, hundreds would be wantonly destroyed; and, after counselling with the officers, I offered to the men, to take Higgins with me, find the proprietor of the field if possi. ble and obtain a supply; if not, that we would have it anyhow, taking the risk upon ourselves. All this, upon the condition that they themselves should in no manner molest the field. To this they agreed, and Higgins and I set forth. By the side of the field we walked until we were tired. No end appeared to it, and no house could we see; it must have been miles around, and have belonged to some wealthy planter. There was nothing left but for us to help our selves. We returned, and jumping over a very deep ditch, and climbing up a six-feet fence near our camp, we were among the corn. It took us a long time to select enough ears, fit to be eaten, to fill our bags, and I was walking along slowly, feeling for them, when I came upon an open space. In the middle was a stump, on   UP A STUMP.       209 the stump sat a man, and in his hands was a double-barrel. I thought a good deal, and thought it pretty fast too. Instantly I hailed: "Lieutenant Higgins, let your men surround this spot; here is the deserter." The proprietor of the gun was now quite as much taken aback as I; and immediately step- ping back among the corn, I met Higgins, and told him to follow quickly. I walked a short dis- tance, and then set off on a run-Higgins keeping up, and wanting to know what was the matter; but as he was rather deaf, it was a difficult matter, running as we were, to make him hear. Besides, he was quite as deaf in his ideas as he was in his ears, and after anything forced its way through these important orifices, it was a long time indeed before it was properly lodged in the brain. Under these circumstances, I could think of nothing better than to recite the negro chant- "Debil in de corn field, "Run boys, run boys; "Debil in de corn field, "Run boys, run.

En revanche, he jumped at the fence, struck me, and QUITE knocked me over. Down from the top I toppled, and fell, corn and all, full twelve feet into the bottom of the ditch, accompanied in my fall by Higgins, who landed directly on me. With a violent effort I sprang up, pitching him over on his back; but he was up in an instant, out of the ditch, running at top speed for camp, and yelling for help like a good fellow. Before I could throw the corn out-which we had disseminated very thoroughly in the ditch- all the boys were on hand, and we returned in tril umph, bearing our cereal treasures, which I divi- ded among the men. That night we mounted guard in earnest, turned out by day-break, and put fifteen miles between us and the corn fields before we halted for breakfast. We were in danger, and knew it. There was, and is yet, a bitter feeling of hatred between the settlers on either side of the Sabine, extending back from the river many a good mile. When a rascal in either the States or Texas had fairly arri. ved at the end of his rope, and could speculate with some probability, as to his soon getting at the   HmUNTING BUT NOT FINDING.   2" end of Judge Lynch's, he crossed the river, and was safe from legal consequences. Forays were often made from either side, in pursuit of runaway scamps or stolen negroes and horses. Conflicts often occurred, and take it alto- gether, the Sabine was in a fair way of becoming another Solway. We breakfasted, which was the last meal that we had for nearly three days. One of our men was here taken with the ague ; captain tired with his early march; provisions out; consequence was, we pretty much all went a hunting; and as every man went where he pleased, and as far as 'he pleased, the sun had passed his meridian, and was well started on his down trip, before all hands returned; and when they did, not a soul had either feather, fur, or fin to exhibit. We picked up our plunder, and moved on. After marching six or eight miles, we came to an excellent place to camp again. Captain ordered ahalt; men grumbled, but submitted. No sup- per but coffee and a pipe. According to my road- book-for it was my duty to act as pilot-We were to reach the Calcasio next day, and then have nothing but cow-trails and blazes for most of the remainder of our route. Our captain's favorite song and motto was4-- "Up in the mornin's no' for me,  "Up in the mornin' early."    <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6605-00000108"/> 212 DEBIL IN DE CORi FIELD--RUN BOYS, RUN. but next morning he was about and a doing as early as any. Hunger was beating a rat-a-la upon his empty stomach, and starvation fairly kicked Morpheus out of doors. We was up and astir, by day-break again: breakfast of coffee and pipes; and off we went this time in good spirits for the banks of the Calcasio, which had been represented to us as a capital hunting ground, and its waters a well. stocked fish-pond; in fact, this was to be the first oasis in our desert march. Well, we reached it at last, and in place of a sparkling river, with green banks and water sing- ing blithely, as it tripped along and rippled over a clear pebbly bottom, we found a-stream it was not-but long, vile mud-hole, without life or motion; low sunken between lofty banks of bar- ren sand, without a sign of vegetation or spear of grass, and overhung by the gaunt cypress, or spectral looking oaks, that extended their leaf- less arms, draped with funereal moss to the sky, as if to call down a curse from Heaven on the Dead Sea beneath. I never could look upon a scene like this- giant trees, so conquered by this miasma-fed parasite as to appear dead, and lifeless, and grey, and hovering over some black tarn or muddy lake, like to the vile buzzard floating over a carcase-   HEAD AND TAIL.      213 without a shudder. However, the bayou was not probably made to please us, and fish there might be in spite of mud; and game in the swamps there doubtless was. Among our men we had a capital woodsman and hunter, whose match with a rifle I have never yet seen. This man, and also another very decent fellow, ready to do anything for the officers, the captain had taken into our mess. His idea was, evidently, that Cooper was to hunt for us, and Carpenter cook and wash the dishes. Now, Cooper's first duty was to his mess; their wants supplied, the company was to come in for a chance at the sports of Nimrod. So the captain and Higgins stretched themselves comfortably on the ground; Cooper shouldered his rifle, and took to the swamp; I cut a cane, -and waded into the bayou, and the men separated; one, one way, and another, another. Prime and Higgins made some remarks about the dubious appearance of the stream, and decli- ned fishing, from a slight prejudice against alliga- tors. They did not like the reptile's mouth, but were rather desirous to try the tail, which they had been told was really high-flavored and gamey. I was fishing in a broad, deep part of the bayou, and one of the men was by my side.

Not one breath of air disturbed the branches or waved the moss. I turned to my neighbor. "Jarboe," said I, "look up quick, and see if there is a squirrel in that large tree right over us. I can see none." "Nor I neither, leftenant," said he, "but 'pears to me I kin hear a chipperin' like." At this moment down come a large branch right between us. "Good Heavens, man!"I shouted, "out of the water, quick, for your life. Not that way, but this-to the right." Away went hook and line, and away we sped. It was high time. In a moment after, down rushed a monarch of the woods, seeming fairly to spring from the lofty bank, And rushing from his mountain height, Came crashing, thundering down."

I looked up and down the stream, and on both sides cypress, oak, and pine, were waving their moss-clad boughs, in sad farewell to their departed chief. I knew that the rush of air, caused by the fall, was the reason of this, but yet the sight chilled my very blood, so melancholy and supernatural did it appear."

"AFTER noon," said Milward, "the men began to drop in, but no game had they found except one squirrel, which was divided among the fortu. nate mess to which the successful hunter belonged. So, we had the old story, coffee and pipes for din. ner. About two we resumed our march, and stri- king off from the main road, took a left hand trail. Before night it come on to rain, which improved matters very much. However, we made the best of it, lit with much difficulty a huge camp-fire, rigged up a few rude wigwams with bark and brush; then followed our usual substitute for a supper, and then to our blankets with what appetite we might. Our reveille was of the latest. Spite of the consolations of coffee and tobacco, hunger was beginning to tell upon our small corps. Why it was that no game could be found I can hardly 216   WATERMELONS IN PROSPECTIVE.   217 say, but only know that it never is, when .ldies of men are moving, except indeed on the buffalo grounds. We had at least some good hunters, one of them thorough bred, but so far their efforts had been all in vain. A man on horseback rode up soon after we had started; and from him I obtained all necessary information as to the trail which we were now fol- lowing, and also that our prospects of finding any- thing in the shape of food that morning were very slim. Some ten miles further on was a settler's cabin, but the family were under short allowance, and had no corn but what they brought from a mill that was miles away. "There's no use to try to buy nor to beg," said he, "but, tell you what, boys, afore you get there, there's the biggest kind of a field. The corn's very late, and ain't no account yet, but there's watermelons by the cart-load. You'd best dive in and help yourselves. "Three miles further on, you'll find a trail goin' off to the left; a mile will bring you to another settler's. He's got some corn, and a raft of hogs runnin' in the woods; and when you leave there you'll find another trail that 'll bring you back to your own road without losin' much time." We thanked hir  he rode on, and we walked    <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6605-00000111"/> 218    THE BEWILDERED CORPORAL. on. Cooper went ahead; the men straggling ev. erywhere. About noon, we saw a tiny column of blue smoke peacefully wending its way upward, in the open woods; and arriving, lo and behold, there was Cooper with one grey squirrel, already broiled, and waiting for us. Talk of honor among thieves or any class else. Here was a man on the confines of starvation, that had been half an hour tantalized with the deliious odors of a broiling squirrel, and waiting to di- vide it among five. We made short work of it, and then waited until our men came up. Presently we came to a spot in the forest, where our trail was entirely obscured by fallen timber. There was an open space before us of at least fifty rods, the over. thrown trees all lying towards the northeast. We were slowly crawling over it, when Cooper called to us. "I know this well," said he; " this is the trail of the Natchez hurricane, and I have crossed it more than two hundred miles west of this. A short distance further on, we shall find another, running side by side with this, but only about half as wide." This we found to be true, and the twain pre. sented the most singular sight that I had ever   DEPLORABLE IGNORANCE OF PUMPKINS. 219 seen. Two immense avenues cut directly through the heart of the forest, more straight than line or plumet and the hand of man could have made them, extending from beyond Natchez to the Rocky Mountains, walled in on either side by immense trees, shorn of those branches that had obstructed the path of the hurricane ; great masses of fallen timber, piled up, ten, fifteen, and some- times twenty feet, without a green bough, or leaf, or twig, but marked by desolation for a thousand miles. It was something welLworthy of being seen and remembered. Soon after this we came to the field, and there was a regular stampede. Cooper and I tried the melons as to their ripeness, before picking, car- ried off two apiece over the fence, and into the timber we then plunged, and there a queer sight met our eyes. A pile of green pumpkins, with here and there a melon, lay on the ground. Prime and Higgins were busy dissecting them with their swords; some of the men were spluttering out oaths and raw pumpkin from their mouths, and others were enjoying the fun and eating their melons. It was a fact, that neither of the two officers nor one half of the men could distinguish a green pumpkin: from a round watermelon. However, they soon learned, and it Tequired    <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6605-00000112"/> 220    THE BEWILDERED CORPORAL. persuasion, entreaty, and almost the exhibition of force, to check some of the hungry crew in their savage eagerness for this most unsuitable food. As to the green pumpkins, 1 made the men cut them in slices and stow them away in their knap. sacks. We now formed, and marched on, passing the house in as martial array as possible, for very obvious reasons. Presently we found the left hand trail, and be- fore long, a piece of clearing, on the other side of which appeared a cabin and field. Leaving the men in the timber, Prime, Higgins and I went into the cabin; but nothing was to be had. They declared that they had not yet break- fasted, nor could they until a man who had been dispatched to a mill ten miles off should return; that they had neither hogs nor cattle. Nothing was to be done then but to move on. We inquired for the other trail, to return to our  road. It led off to the left of the house, through the same clearing and a young peach orchard. On we went, firing off a pistol and shouting to our men to come down along the fence. To our sur- prise, we heard the crack of a musket immedi- ately ahead. They had then found the trail be- fore us, as it would appear. They had, and something beside. Among our number was a young Frenchman, one of six men   PIG HUNTING.       221, whom we had picked up at New Orleans, re- turned Santa Fe prisoners. Charley had two leading characteristics-a lightning-like quick- ness of thought and- action, and a great fondness of good eating, and plenty of it. The men had started to look for the new trail, when a drove of hogs ran snorting by. One man fired at them but missed. Charley, however, ran up to the captain of the host, delivered the but of his musket in an effective way upon the animal's  snout, who immediately succumbed, and inconti- nently had his throat cut. Our captain was in great trouble, at the neces- sity of hot water for dressing the hog, but Charley was up to everything. He skinned the beast in five minutes, cut it in pieces, and distributed them among the men. It was then high time to be a going. We pushed on, found our old trail, travelled a couple of miles, until we came to a small branch of clear running water, then made a fire, and soon devoured every morsel of our prey. That night we camped near the house of a com- paratively wealthy planter, a Frenchman, who was extremely polite, made us free of his corn- crib, if we would grind the grain in his steel mill, and told us to take enough to last until we should reach the Sabine, on the condition that our men should be kept out of his field.    <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6605-00000113"/> 222    THE BEWILDERED CORPORAL. He also sent a pair of large tame ducks for the officers, a bag of Irish potatoes for the men, and a large pot to boil them in; also, quite a piece of salt pork. With this material, and our slices of green pumpkin, we made a noble stew for all hands. Next morning down came a large supply of green figs, and an invitation for the officers to call upon the ladies. We did so, and though the call was of short duration, were most hospitably re ceived. We took leave of our generous host, and went on our way rejoicing, provided with provi. sions enough to last until the Sabine should be passed, and ourselves fairly upon the soil of Texas. In two days we were encamped upon the shores of that celebrated stream, whose yellow waters are said by historians to possess some of the quali. ties of the ancient Lethe, and to completely oblite rate in the minds of those who drink or bathe in their yellow current, all usually received ideas of the correct distinctions between mewm and tepm. The effect upon our men was different; per- haps on a similar principle to that which makes two negatives equal an affirmative; perhaps be- cause we were cordially welcomed and hospitably entertained, when once fairly in Texas.   THE WASHNG BRIGADE.     223 From a set of vagabonds, laying their hands on every thing that came in their way, they became orderly, seemingly honest, and obedient to orders. At the ferry we lay one entire day, converting the river into an extempore and al fresco wash- tub, and a company of volunteers into a washing brigade. The ferry people were extremely civil, and evidently anxious to get rid of us; for the pre- sence of nineteen or twenty men, well armed, upon the very border of another country, where they could retreat in five minutes, was an occur- rence more uncommon than desirable; and when coupled with the fact that the said men were almost destitute of everything save arms and am- munition, that the proprietor of the ferry kept a small store hard by, and that the entire popula- tion of the settlement did not exceed three or four families, it was no wonder that they wished us further. Our washing and drying completed-we gene- rally took to the river during the latter operation, and disdained either starching or ironing-on the next day we crossed the stream, and for the first time set foot upon the very free soil of Texas. Our first night we passed in Jasper, not a very large city We were inducted into an unoccupied house, and furnished with green corn ad lib., and dry corn, exhibited in a liquid form, uazt. 8uft.    <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6605-00000114"/> 224    THE BEWILDERED CORPORAL. We were visited by a young gentleman, evi. dently overflowing with patriotic and poetic fire. He had composed a warlike song, and was indu. ced, after two or three critical examinations of our canteens, to favor us with it. The air was Bruce's Address; as for the words, the first verse alone remains embalmed in my memory, and ran as follows:-  ' Men who have with Houston bled; "Men whom Rusk has often led,  "Welcome to your gory bed, "- Or to victory." Having heard this, Prime drew me one side, and, with an air of caution and secresy, produced from some secret recess about his person a soiled and somewhat tatter'd paper. It proved to be also an original poem, embodying in a different form the same sanguinary ideas as. those of our young friend, and also hospitably invited "all whom it might concern" to take a friendly bed on the battle-field, if they couldn't give the enemy fits. This, the captain informed me, I had his full permission to impart to our new friend in private. I was not to inform him of the author's name, but might hint that it was composed by one of the officers, although neither Lieutenant Higgins nor I claimed it. Upon hearing this brilliant produ-   THE VOLUNTEER'S SPEECH.    22 tion, our young friend embraced the captain, called him his brother in arms, and swore an eter- nal friendship; ran off up street, and soon re- turned with another bottle of the amber-colored nectar in general use here, and having assisted in draining it, announced his intention of marching along with us, and assisting at our proposed revel in the halls of the Montezumas. A corporal, moved by whiskey and admiration, resigned in his favor, and the new incumbent was duly installed in his place. Standing in the midst, he now delivered a glow- ing speech, in which he expressed a canabalistic desire for a slice of Santa Anna's heart, and a san- guinary wish for a draught of his blood; also re- peatedly requested us to follow him to glory; con- veyed several commands relative to charging the enemy, and concluded with a recitation of his ode, which was sung by the whole company pleno ore, being lined off by the author., It was quite late, and after embracing us all around, and shedding a copious flood of tears, he bade us adieu for the night, and went home to prepare himself for the march. Alas! we never saw the gallant youth after; whether the two potent nectar confined him to his couch, or cruel parents checked his warlike aspi- rations, is a matter forever hidden from my know-    <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6605-00000115"/> 226    THE BEWILDERED CORPORAL. ledge, and I but know that on calling the roll next morning both the old corporal and the new incumbent were reported as missing. About noon our original corporal, Peter An- thony Jarboe, hove in sight. His account of his adventures was somewhat vague and desultory, owing probably to the lingering mistiness of his brain. It appears that the gallant youth of last eve ning, finding that the contents of his whiskey bot- tie had entirely evaporated, dispatched Corporal Peter Anthony with two canteens, and a verbal order on the grocery, to have them filled, and charged to his-the youth's-account. Mr. Jarboe's remembrance of the occurrencesat said grocery was exceedingly indistinct. A crowd of men-two tallow candles-an invitation to drink from two men, seemingly united Siamese twin fashion-two bar-keepers filling four tum- blers from two bottles-a strange confusion oi ideas--a general pirouette of room, company, bar keepers, bottles and glasses, and a deep reverie made up the unsatisfactory detail. Whether the canteens were filled or not e could not say. Upon an examination of the arti cles in question, it appeared, that not satisfied with his blunders of the preceding evening, he had deliberately made a 'bull' in the canteens, a j,   MR.

It would appear that Mr. Jarboe was aroused from his reverie on the closing of the grocery- grocery means whiskey in Texas-which occur- rence-according to Mr. J.-took place some time between midnight and the fourth of July, Mr. Jarboe thinks that the city of Jasper must have suffered a civil revolution during the night ; perhaps engaged in a contra dance; been down in the middle, up again and cast off. Our barracks could not be found in the general confusion, and so the corporal knocked at a convenient door to inquire. A gentleman, arm- ed with a pair of revolvers and bowie knife, opened it, and after hearing Mr. Jarboe's busi- ness, informed him that the company of volun- teers had left at midnight; and for fear of mis- takes, he was kind enough to put on his boots and accompany the lost one some little distance upon the road. Peter Anthony set forth upon a run, held it as long as he could, then subsided into a fast walk; and just as it was fairly day-break, found himself on the banks of the Sabine, at the very spot where he had crossed the preceding morning. Evidently something was wrong, so without as stopping to rest, back he posted to Jasper, to    <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6605-00000116"/> 228    THE BEWILDEED COPOBRAL. inquire; and met his obliging friend, who recog. nized him, immediately asked him to drink, and informed him that about midnight a drove of jackasses had passed through town, and was by him mistaken for a company of Texan volun. teers. In three hours after, the poor fellow caught up with us, having travelled twenty miles upon a fool's errand, and fifteen more since he had left Jasper." "I reckon now, Milward," said Uncle Billy, "that corporal must hev been right smart of a fool, or else most owdaciously whiskey'd." "Both your conclusions, Major," replied Mil ward, "are clearly correct, and indisputable." J    CHAPTER XXII. OWPORAL JARBOR AMN THE BLOOD-HOUND-THE PIONEERS TREED. "As we were travelling on," resumed Mil- ward, "about five o'clock, a jovial looking man, mounted upon what Uncle Billy would classify as a smart chunk of a poney, rode up, and finding out who we were, immediately insisted upon the men's camping near his house, and the officers spending the night within it. We were served with the best he had, and Prime and Higgins slept on a bed for the first time since leaving New Orleans. As for me, I preferred to spend the night with the men, and to see that they did not get into mischief. The latter were provided with corn bread and bacon in abundance, and better still, great calabashes of new milk. In the morning, after an excellent breakfast, our host supplied us with provisions, and telling us to be sure and call upon his father-in-law--who lived five miles further upon the road, and had an im- 229 EJ-    <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6605-00000117"/> /I    f i 230 OORPORAL JAROE AND THE BLOODI-HOJD. mense peach orchard--shook us heartily by tj hand, and we parted. We called upon the old gentleman, who imm diately insisted upon our resting all day and cruiting. This we at first declined doing. "Now look here, boys," said he, "I'll tell y what it is. You'll do well enough till you erc the Trinity; and when you get shut of the tim ber and strike into the perara, there's a house but there's ony two more on your road afore y get to Houston, and they both together-oneat the Attascasete crossing of the San Jacinto, and the other a piece on, in the timber t'other side.

I'll go on to Dunn's, and have him kill a beef, and there you can stay a day and dry it, and then you'll be ready for the peraras," This embodiment of good sense and genuine hospitality overruled our anxiety to hurry on, and so we remained. A long table was immediately set, and a meal prepared for all hands--our host insisting that after our long semi-starvation we should be always ready to eat; and that soldier,    I  CORPORAL PETER ON THE FENCE.  231 like camels, always laid in a stock at every oppor- tunity, and against time of need. While the meal was preparing, negro boys brought in great bas- kets filled with huge watermelons and ruddy- cheeked peaches. After converting us into human sausages, and stuffing us until the skin would hold no more, our entertainer made us free of peach- orchard and melon-patch, told us that dinner would be on the table at one precisely, and that we must enjoy ourselves as we pleased. We had most of us taken our pipes, and thrown ourselves down upon our blankets, under the shade of a friendly porch-I for one was about invading the Land of Nod-when a terrific mix- ture of howl, yell, and shriek called our attention towards the bars through which we had entered the enclosure, and there on the inner side was our unfortunate Corporal, Peter Anthony Jarboe, his feet on the second bar from the ground, endeavor- ing to reach the latter; while on the outer, hung a huge blood-hound, maintaining his hold upon the vestments that covered the rearmost division of the corporal's nether man. The whole thing put me in mind of two bull- dogs hung across a line. A yell of laughter burst from the entire com- pany, and it was some time before our host could command sufficient control of the Queen's Eng-    <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6605-00000118"/> 232    THE BEWILDLiRED CORPORAL. lish to call the dog off. He then warned us about quitting or returning to the enclosure unless con. voyed by some one of his numerous family, black or white. Corporal Peter, whose performance with fire. arms was a standing joke-in fact, he could not have hit a barn-door but by accident, and closing his eyes ere he pulled trigger-had, it seems, em. braced the opportunity to go a hunting all alone by himself, determined to astonish and excite the admiration of the company generally, and of our host in particular, with his exploits. He had clambered over the bars, but hardly had he touched bottom' on the other side, when a fero- cious dog sprang out from the bushes, and per. formed the same operation on him, as he wheeled and was marching off for camp in the fastest kind of double-quick. Corporal Jarboe's naturally expressive counte- nance bore for a while a stern look, and he inti- mated an intention of settling arrears with the dog, but the rents behind being skilfully collected by a negress, and the tenant proving uninjured, it at last subsided into the usual calm, satisfied, and slightly stupid expression. No other adventure marked the day, and on the morrow, after a capital breakfast, we were hur- ried off by our kind friend, who warned us to be r .i  .   BLAZES AND COW TRAILS.    233 sure and let no grass grow under our feet until we had forded the Angelina and been ferried over the Neches, since the trail between the two rivers had but just been blazed, was through bush and briar, and could scarcely be followed in broad day. So that if we were overtaken by night be- fore we had completed our intended distance, we had better call a halt, and camp down, or worse might come of it. We left, and hurried on; but camping for din- ner, and a protracted call upon a certain Captain Blank-including a visit to his peach orchard- made it quite late ere we reached Bevilport, rather a small town, and containing either onie or two houses-I forget which. We had now to ford the Angelina, and so much time was consumed in finding the ford and get- ting over, that it was sundown when we were fairly landed on the other side. Before us was five miles of blazed road, through anything but a "sporting" country, and almost without sign of trail; at least the trails made by deer and wild animals generally, were so much more distinct than the slight trace which we were to follow, that we had been strongly cautioned to stick to the blazes, and pay no attention to any- thing else. A council of war was held. To reach Swart-    <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6605-00000119"/> 234    THE BEWILDERED CORPORAL.   wout, on the Trinity-or rather Captain Dunn's plantation-we had before us three very severe days' journey, one of them forty miles. Should we risk a night march through bottom and brake, or put another five miles upon the next day's work? We put it to vote. There were three modes proposed: To camp where we were-to reach the Neches at any rate, if we could-or to send Cooper and me ahead, (who always acted as pioneers in cases of emergency,) to follow the trail and blaze as long as practical and expedient, and when we could go no further with safety, then to camp. Our position to be made known by the discharge of a pistol at least once in ten minutes. Corporal Peter Anthony, and a sleepy-headed chap from Indiana, supported the first plan; the captain and Higgins, the second; all the other the third and last. So Cooper and I went of. For a short distance, we found it plain sailing enough, then our trail disappeared, and we hadto look sharp for the blazes; then we found the trail again, and it was not long ere four of the more impatient of our men caught up with us-the others being reported as quite a distance behind. At last we came to a spot where our trace diverged slightly to the left, and at this moment, the moon most mischievously bobbed behind    cloud, so that we could not see which way the blazes pointed out, nor could we find any by feeling. We at last followed the trail, which was soon joined by two others, and at last led us to the but of a huge tree, apparently laying down on the ground. The trail turned neither to the right nor to the left, but stopped square against the tree. A bridge, for sartin," said Cooper. "I wonder they'd hadn't told us about it: I reckon we'd best hold on." He had not finished, however, before our four men had clambered upon the trunk, and were on their way over. I listened-could hear nothing like the sound of water-and, remarking, that it must be over a gulley, for there seemed to be no probability of finding a still bayou so near two swiftly running rivers; and a branch beneath us, there certainly was not. I mounted upon the tree and prepared to follow the men. Cooper imitated my example. For at least sixty feet we walked on without finding a limb; we then found enough of them, and troublesome they were; at last our men cried out that they were as far in the top as they dared go, and there seemed to be no landing-place. At this moment the moon peeped out, brightly, as if to enjoy the fun; and lo atnd, behold, there   <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6605-00000120"/> THE BEWILDERED CORPORAL.   we were, in a tree-top, almost half-way across an immense gulley, and at least sixty feet from the bottom. Having enjoyed the sight, Madam Luna went in again under the cover of a black cloud, and we were once more in the dark. It is astonishing what a difference it makes when you are walking upon a log, whether it rest upon the ground, or hangs over a precipice. The men who enjoyed the fun of walking out and making their way through the crowded limbs of the top, were now thoroughly frightened, and called to me to fire my pistol, to attract the atten. tion of the company, at the same time floundering about in their attempts to get back. "Keep perfect silence," said I, " and remain where you are until the company come up. 1 shall not fire my pistol, or make any noise, to a6 tract them to us and out of their right path. When they reach the spot where we turned off, they will halt and wait to hear from us. As for you four in the top, remain where you are, until the moon comes out again, or we can light a fire, if you do not want to get your necks broken. Don't move until you are ordered, and then not until your names are called. Who is furthest out? "Corporal Jarboe." "Who next "  "Sergeant Osborne."   And then?" "Me, sir; Private Maryatt." ' Better be thinking of your sins, Charley, inclu- ding the pig you stole and skinned 'tother day. Are you the nearest, Carpenter? "Yes, sir." "Then stay where you are, and hang on for life.   , At this moment, Cooper bade me listen, and presently I heard the trami of our men. They soon reached the place where we lost the trail, halted, and fired a pistol. We called to them to stay where they were. I sent Cooper off to explain matters, and in a few minutes he returned with several of the men who came out to have some fun with our treed coons. The first thing to be done was, to make a fire, and we sent back to the forks, where one was already started, for a light. Before it arrived, however, the moon again appeared; and I called, first, Carpenter-then Maryatt-then Osborne- and, lastly, our friend, Peter Anthony. His luck did not desert him, for before he got fairly out of the top and on the body, in went the moon. He, however, made his way along towards the end, and when opposite us jumped off to the right, and in a moment was heard yelling out-   <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6605-00000121"/> 238   THE BEWILDERED CORPORAL.   "Oh, lordy, massy! help t murder I'm a goner, stop me, some one." These words seemed to be jerked out of him a he rolled over and over down the steep sidesof the ravine, a small spur of which ran up to the very stump of the tree upon one side of it, and Mr. Jarboe, to save a few feet upon the log, jumped off, and right into it. Had we known that every bone in the man's body was broken, it would not have made the least difference. A most unsympathetic roar of laughter made the welkin ring, and called up the rest of the men. As soon as I could find my voice, I went to the edge of the ravine, now plainly distinguishable by the fire-light, and called- "Jarboe, hallo I are you hurt?" No answer. I called again. "If you've any life left, sayso; if not, we are very hungry, and must get supper." A grumbling was heard below, and words and parts of sentences came up. "Laugh at a feller - don't keer; laughin's ketchin-lick some one." "Hold on," said I; "we will build a fire on the edge of the gully." The fire was built upon the very edge, and in a few minutes Corporal Peter Anthony hove in   THE CORPORAL'S SECOND DISAPPEARANCE. 239 sight-musket and all-covered with mud and water, for, as a Milesian would say, he had landed in a water hole at the bottom. When fairly on the bank, he shook his fist at us generally, then shook himself off like a lion in his wrath, and then looking around for Maryatt-the smallest man in the company-and not finding him at hand, jumped at the next smallest who was convenient-Sergeant Osborne. Now, the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the slow-no, that's not right; in fact, about as bad as Governor Bell's quotation the other day-the battle is not always to the big- gest, is what I mean. Peter Anthony weighed two hundred and thirty-a giant, and a mad giant at that-Osborne not more than one hundred and fifty; but the lat- ter eying the former, as he struck out awkwardly, warded the blow, and planted one, two, so cor- rectly that Mr. Jarboe instantly disappeared, and was next heard of from his old mud-hole, in the bottom of the ravine, and from it he was not allowed to emerge, until he had pledged his word to behave himself in future." "Didn't that are chap work out somewhare on Buffalo Bayou?" interrupted Bunce. "I think he did," replied Milward.

CHAPTER XXII.  A NIGHT WITH E RATTLENAKES--CORPORAL JARBOB GETS A BITE.  SHORTLY after sunrise the next morning we were at the Neches, exerting our lungs and firing off muskets, to arouse the ferry-man-who turned out to be a boy after all. At last he came, and  his only means of conveyance was a pirogue, or  canoe. The captain was about stepping in, when I stopped him, with-- "One moment, captain. Have you ever pad- died a canoe?"  "No, sir," said he-" but why T" "Because you would be in the water in a mo-j ment, which would not hurt you, perhaps, but     i! you might loose your arms."  The captain drew back, and I ordered the men  to give the boy the arms to deposite in the boat.   i They were to be taken over first, then the bag-  gage, and last of all the living freight.      i "Who understands a pirogue?"I asked. "I      i want some one to help the boy paddle."i    <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6605-00000123"/> 242   A NIGHT WITH THE RATTLESNAKES. "I kin row er paddle-steer er sail," said Cor. poral Peter Anthony. "I can manage a dug-out, sir," said Osborne. "Well," said I " rank takes the precedence of beauty always; you shall cross first, and then we'll try Corporal Jarboe's skill. You need not bring the boy back again. We can manage it ourselves." Across they went, and having landed the arms, Osborne paddled safely back. "Now ashore with you, Osborne, said I, "and bring the paddles. Corporal Jarboe, jump in, and prepare to receive the baggage." Jarboe put in one foot very cautiously, tried to balance himself; drew in the other; pirogue tip- ped one side, Jarboe leaned the other; pirogue followed suit in an instant, and over went Peter Anthony, waving his arms wildly in all'possible directions, until they struck the water. Coming up, he made for the other shore, and being a strong swimmer, reached it without dif- ficulty. With some trouble, but without any accidents, we reached the other shore. The day passed by without any incident worth recording, and so with the next, until the efter- noon, when there burst upon us as terrific a storm as I have ever witnessed. We were drenched in   THE INDIAN CAMP.   243   an instant, and on we must go. There was no shelter nearer than the old Cherokee Peach-tree Village, some time since abandoned by the tribe, and now occupied by a family of settlers. The road that we journey'd over was turned into a stream, but through it we waded and plunged, and night fell just as we reached the old Indian camp. There we found a man and his wife, the sole occupants. They evidently were poor, although we were treated in the most hospi- table manner. We were served with fried venison and bacon, corn bread and coffee-the latter articles being bought in, and brought from New Orleans. A large fire was built in an adjoining cabin, and finding it impossible to dry our saturated clothes, we spread our blankets, and soon were fast asleep. In the morning, we had an excellent breakfast, with figs and peaches-Indian relics these-for dessert; and at parting, gave the man our long treasured three dollars-the proceeds of the salt. At first he refused it, but we forced it on him. He divided a number of pounds of dried venison among ns, and we departed. We had not been more than an hour upon our route, when our old friend at whose house we had spent the previous Thursday, rode up, shook us each by the hand,     <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6605-00000124"/> 244   A NIGHT WH THE RATTLESNAKES.  and trotted off; being bound-as he said-to have the beef all ready for us. This was a severe day for all. Forty miles over a heavy road, often through deep mud, with the thermometer above one hundred, and a heavy knapsack, with musket or side-arms, was no joke. We managed to muster for dinner, but after that were widely separated-Cooper and I far in advance; Prime, Higgins, and Carpenter bring. ing up the extreme rear. It was eight P. M. when we reached Captain Dunn's plantation, and the owner and our old friend met us, a full half mile this side. In front of the cabins fires were burning, meat cooking and drying, negroes flitting to and fro before the lights, and quite an animated scene presented itself. A plentiful supper was provided for us, and down we sat-the men continuing to drop in for two hours, at which time all had arrived, save the captain, Higgins, and Carpenter. They camped some eight miles off-the first two used up by fa. tigue, the latter by the ague. They arrived in time for breakfast next morning. After the sun had passed the meridian heavy clouds began to gather, and portend another violent storm. IFear- ing that the ford at Swartwout might be rendered   BLUE BLAZES.      245 impassable, we packed up our half-dried beef in haste, and took the route. Dunn mounted his horse and left for Swart- wont, promising to meet us on his return-which he did-gave every man a pound of tobacco, made a warlike speech, and bade us adieu. We were not destined to see the Trinity that night. Dunn had hardly clapped spurs to his horse, and dashed off, when a heavy peal of thun- der rolled, echoing through the forest; brilliant flashes of lightning darted to and fro, a hurricane swept the wood, old pines came topling down, and the storm, in terrific grandeur burst upon us. We found a temporary shelter under a large, low, leafy tree; but peal after peal, and flash after flash succeeded; the air was full of electricity, and a lambent tongue of blue flame played around the muskets of the men, and even the hilts of our swords. In a moment, our arms were stacked against the body of the tree, and each one sought shelter under the nearest bush. When the storm ceased, night was upon us, and we were forced to camp where we were. The next morning we arrived at Swartwout, a town then consisting of one small store and one or two houses-named after the distinguished lead- er of that band of modern financiers who mistake peculation for speculation-who here expended    <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6605-00000125"/> 246   A NIGHT WITH THE RATTLESNAXES.    I most of that money which was missing from l Uncle Sam's coffers. We forded the Trinity without accident, save that Corporal Jarboe-professing to be experi. enced in fords, and not liking the course pointed out to us-took one of his own, speedily suc. ceeded in finding a hole, disappeared, and came very near losing his life, in his endeavors to save his musket.  On the opposite bank was the Coshattee vil. lage, where lived the remains of the noblest tribe-the crame de la crgme-of all southern Indians. When the Creeks submitted, the Ouches moved further south, and continued to maintain their independence. When they were conquered, their fiercest tribe-the Seminoles--took refuge in Flo- rida. When they were forced to yield, the Co. shattees, the royal blood of the tribe,- abandoned the Everglades, and found a new hunting-ground in the interior of Texas. During the late Seminole war, all the warriors of this tribe disappeared, and were not seen again until its termination. No white man saw them on their war path; they went and came like shadows. At least fifty warriors crossed and re crossed half of Texas, the whole of Louisiana, Misissippi, Alabama, and part of Florida, with-   PRETTY SQUAWS AND SPANISH ETTLES. 247 out being seen by mortal eye, save that of their own caste. For the first time I now saw squaws, that might, in the strictest sense of the word, be called beau- tiful, though the few men that we saw were of a truly noble mien. Their dwellings, which were neat cabins, were well arranged and comfortable. An immense corn-field, in the midst of which their village stood, was exceedingly well tilled, and bore a heavy crop of corn and pumpkins. Before every door were one or more of those singular old Spanish pots, that are no longer to be met with but in pictures. Who knows but that De Soto may have eaten soup prepared in one of them  We called upon old Collete, the sachem of the tribe, and found him seated, cross-legged, upon the raised platform of cane, that answers for set- tee and bed. He was plainly, but richly dressed, and received us with as much dignity as if he had been every inch a king. When we took leave, he sent his daughter, a beautiful girl of nineteen, and no darker than a rich brunette, to show us through the village and to our road. After leaving the Trinity, the first settlement, then, was on the prairie, twenty-four miles from the river; but ten miles on, stood a deserted cabin,    <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6605-00000126"/> 248   A NIGHT WITH TIlE RATTLESNAKE,. and there we were advised to lodge, build a huge  fire, and if possible, escape the torments of that curse of the Trinity river, the buffalo knat.  At last, we arrived at a spot, where, evidently t  a clearing had been made, but so rank was the growth of the weeds, that the cabin was entirely  hidden from our view; nevertheless, there it was,  when we penetrated the weeds for a few rods, and in pretty good order too. The door had dropped off, and was lost in a rank growth of grass, the hearth was full of cracks, and the old puncheon floor gaped widely, but still it was a shelter, and at least promised protection in case of rain. We congratulated ourselves upon so good a camping. place. Wood was brought to cook our supper; Osborne brought one pail of water from a branch hard by, and Corporal Peter Anthony promised to bring the other after supper, since as it would be only required for drinking, it would be the cooler the later it was. obtained. As it was warm, and as we were not particularly hungry, we determined to put off fire-lighting and supper as long as possible, and so lighting our pipes, sat down to rest and chat. Supper-time came at last. One of the men com- menced making the fire, but not in manner to please Mr. Jarboe, who, jumping up in haste, to arrange matters to his satisfaction, fell sprawling   PETER'S BUMBLE-BEES NEST.   249 over the pail of water, upsetting it, and receiving a large share of its contents on his own person. For this exploit he was rewarded with a peremp- tory order to take both pails and fill them imme- diately. The old house stood upon piles, some three feet high, and was, as usual, open under- neath. The step was gone, and so Corporal Jarboe sprang down, but in an instant bounded back again, pale as a sheet, declaring as soon as fear loosed his tongue, that he had jumped on a rattle- snake as large as his arm. "Humbug," exclaimed Osborne, seizing the pails, and making for the den. "Hold your horses, Osborne," said Cooper; "might be-looks like no fool of a place for 'em." Cooper seized a long stick, and going to the den, swept the tops of the rank weeds with it, and poked about on the ground. 6 Come here, and listen," said he. "Bumbly bees nest,' said Jarboe ; " and 'pears to me I kin smell cowcumbers." "Bumble bees and cucumbers! you immortal jackass," exclaimed Cooper; "why, man, if there's one rattlesnake within reach of this pole, there's a dozen. Light that fire, Osborne, and you'll hear fun." The moment that the flame seized upon the dry bticks, illuminating the room, and shining through    <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6605-00000127"/> 25U   A NIGHT WITH THE RATTLESNAKES. the crevices of the floor upon the ground under. neath, we were saluted with a burst of rattlesnake music, from countless performers beneath us, and not more than three feet beneath us, either. We were evidently in a snake den, and prison. ers for the night, without a drop of water or half a supply of wood. From one corner of the roof we tore down some boards, to lay over the crevi. ces in the floor, and also for fuel; and while so doing, something fell from above and landed at Corporal Peter Anthony's feet. "Well," exclaimed that worthy, " dern my skin, ef you ain't the funniest beggar I ever see. Why you're a heap curioser than them horn-toads they tell on. I'm bound to carry you to Houston, alive, that's a fact." And so he started to pick his curiosity up. "Let be!" roared out Cooper. "Why, man, that's a centepede, a heap worse than rattlesnake or moccasin." Peter Anthony betook himself incontinently to the furthest corner of the cabin, and the cente- pede was immediately killed and thrust into the fire. That most wretched night I shall never forget Driven to frenzy by the gnats; sweltering at times, with our heads under our blankets as long as we could bear it; tormented with thirst-with   CORPORAL PETER 'S LAST.   251   rattlesnakes beneath and centepedes and scor- pions above-oh! it makes my flesh creep now to think of it. How we left the spot as early as possible; how we camped at the next settlement; how we marched fourteen miles, under an August sun, without water, and when we reached Luce Bayou, found it dry except in one small mud-hole, that was fairly alive with moccasin and water-rattle- snakes; how we were forced to dip up the nau- seous compound, and after mixing it with ashes, let it settle, and use it; how Cooper and I had called two fire does out of a thicket, and were just about firing from a snug hiding-place, when Jarboe, who had been expressly ordered to remain in camp, blazed away at them, and but just missed us; how we were routed from  our camp that night by mosquitoes; how we lost our track, and got into the Hoffman settlement; how well we were treated, even to the furnishing of a team to take our baggage to Houston; how, when we arri- ved, we found the Revel was adjourned sine die-I want both time and patience to relate; but will conclude with the corpoil's last ad- venture. We were camped at the Atascasete ford of the San Jacinto. Our fires were built on a glistening shingle, and before us rolled a river, whose cold,   <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6605-00000128"/> 252   A NIGHT WITH THE RATTLESNAKESo. pellucid waves brought to our minds the pure streams of our fatherland. A brilliant sunset had set its seal upon a day of extreme warmth, and the glowing hues that gilded the evanescent twilight of this semi-tropical re- gion, were fast deepening into night. The feath- ered tenants of wood and plain, that from the lofty tree top, or the lowly shrub-perched upon some leafless branch, or floating suspended in the clear blue ether, had poured forth their very souls in glorious melody, had ceased, and their evening  hymn was sung. The amphibia of river and swamp, had comr menced their contra-basso serenade, aided with an occasional solitary note from crane, heron, or water-turkey. In fact, it was night, and the monstrous bull- frogs in the adjacent cypress brakes, and sundry and divers other abominable Reptiles were making an abominable row. We were all preparing to bathe, or else already splashing in the river, when  Captain Prime, struck with the loud swelling bull-frog chorus, asked the corporal " what it was that made that horrid noise?" and received in reply, that " it was nothing but alligators." Prime did not bathe, but contented himself with a modest ablution in very shallow water.   BULLFROGS AND ALLIGATORS.   253: "Jarboe," said I, when out of the captain's hearing, "did you think you were playing off a capital joke on the captain, about the alligators?" "Why, sir, he's so amazin' green about some things, I can't help havin' aleetle fun some- times." Well, only look out yourself, that's all; there's a proverb about going out after wool, and coming home shorn. I can but tell you one thing- there is not a stream in Texas so noted for alliga- tors as this same San Jacinto; they all come up from the bay to summer in its cold waters." The corporal was half frightened, and for a time stuck to the shallow current of the ford, but the sight of the others splashing and swimming in deeper water below, proved too great a tempta- tion for him. I gave our mischievous Frenchman a hint, and he proceeded to act upon it. Charley swam like a duck-on the water or under, it was pretty much the same to him. Peter Anthony was standing up to his neck in water; he had just looked up stream, to be very sure tflat no alligator was behind him, and seeing nothing but Charley, some four rods off, turned round again, spread out his arms, and proceeded in his usually slow and majestic manner, to swim. The moment that he turned, Charley-who was    <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6605-00000129"/> 254   A NIGHT WITH THE RATTLESNAKES. standing upon the bar-plunged into the deeper water, and pulled, entirely submerged, for the corporal. Peter heard the splash, partly turned hround, could see nothing but the disturbed water, and being pretty thoroughly alarmed, struck out for the shore, just as Charley, under water, seized both legs with his hands, his long sharp nails cut ting through the epidermis. The bellow of a mad bull was eolian melody compared to that of Peter Anthony. "I HELP! HE--E-E-ELP! he roared. "Oh the Gorry Mighty! ALLIGATOR! ALLIGATOR!! AmI-  GA-A-A-TOR!!! Oh, boys! Oh! OH, pull me outl" Three or four seized him-Charley keeping his hold- until the corporal was drawn ashore, in a  condition as near fainting as a man of his nature  could be.  A word and a wink to the men was enough;   i and to this day the ci-devant corporal believes firmly in his miraculous escape from the alligators of the San Jacinto; and during the short time he remained with us, certainly did not wash either face or hands; which we attributed to his newly acquired horror of the water. The last authentic information that I received of Mr. Jarboe was from a distinguished naturalist,  who narrated to me the extraordinary escape from   THE CAPTAIN.       255 an alligator, of a man who lived then upon Buf- falo Bayou.

"He was an excellent drill officer, a gentleman of birth and education, but possessed of, or rather by certain high toned chivalrous notions, that did not accord with a command of volunteers-and of such volunteers. His pride, and their independ- ence; his chivalrous ideas, and their general want of principle, clashed continually. He was as brave a man as ever lived, and I have seen hin tried. He would have led a company of regulars with honor to himself and them-,but could not get on with New Orleans volunteers. Among them were a few good men, but the rest of them were certainly only food for powder. I had some of them with me in our race after Wool, but after that time, lost entire track of every one ex- cept of our friend Corporal Peter Anthony Jar- boe-who has succeeded much better in raising corn and potatoes, upon shares, than he ever would have done in fighting the Mexicans." \    <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6605-00000130"/> ti b CHAPTER IV XIV.

You see it- was plaguy nigh winter when I come, and I stayed on till it was so pesky cold, I had to up killick, and steer for a warmer climit. This Joe Hopkins and me, when I lived up there, had made many a trade, but I was sort of afeard of him now, that's a fact.

You're afeard of me, that's what it is; but you can't keep from tradin' and I'll make a dicker with ye afore you've quit these parts, I'll bet a leather ninepence against a Bungtown copper."

Now see here, Joe, I may make a trade with you; it's in my blood, and I can't help it, but I give you fair warnin' Joe, that I never will, unless I'm morally certin I cut through hair and hide clean into the quick." Joe laughed at me, and said he'd keep his eyes wide open. Afore the week went by, he'd chiz- zled my younger brother George, awful, in a boss trade, and thinks I, 'my fine feller, if that chance does turn up, maybe you won't ketch it.' 1    <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6605-00000131"/> 258     DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND. Now the hoss he'd traded to George was nat. rally a dreadful fast crittur, full blood, and not more'n nine year old, but so awful bad foundered that she wasn't worth the price of her keep to no created bein'. About two mile off, down to Squashtown, old Deacon Solomon Squash had a eight year old mare, almost the very picter of George's hard bargain, only she was sound all over-mane hogged, tail-bobbed, and a white star in her forred. When I'd studied it all over, I got an idee into my head, made George shut up the mare, and put the oil cake and the oats into her by the bushel. She was blanketed, and cleaned, and rubbed down, and her feet docter'd, and for a month wasn't put to no work-neither saddle, nor waggon, nor team. That wasn't all; I hogged her mane, and bobbed her tail, and when her coat got into order, and shone like a glass bottle, you couldn't have told her from the Dea con's mare-to look at her-all but that plaguy white star. There come a snow bimeby, and a deep one. There hadn't been much for two or three years afore--and there wasn't a sleigh in order no where around; but a neighbor soon rigged up a sizeable drygoods box on a pair of hoop-poles, and shaved the poles where they showed, and painted 'em, and when a big buffalo skin was thrown clean   JOE "FOUND OUT."     259 over the box, the hull concern looked amazin' fine, and run slick as grease.

We druv over to his house, and fixed up things, and then, leavin' George, I pulled rein for the tavern, and went by it like a streak, round in the yard, put my mare under the shed, blanketed her, went into the tavern, and asked for Joe Hopkins.

"Well," resumed Bunce, "I druv over slow- jest so's to keep the mare warm, and not fret her, and took pesky good care not to go nigh Dolit- tie tavern, but put up at Elder Lovejoys, who wer a clean opposition to the deacon.

MUD AND WATEIR--THE TOBACCO HUNT. THE Judge, who had-been very quiet for some  time--so quiet indeed that I believed him dozing  --raised his head, and fixing a quizzical look upon I Buncee, remarked- "If I were examining you in court, Sam, I should say that your story was a skillful way of avoiding an answer. You were asked to explain your absence, at a period when all Texas and part  of the South-western States were arming, and you  have replied by an amusing account of a horse  trade, leaving seven good months to be accounted P for." "There now, Judge," replied Sam, "I shouldn't wonder if you'd nosed out a mare's nest. Them 1 seven months I spent in York, and Philadelphty, and Cincinater, and Orleans, a picking up odds and eends, for most nothin', and that was about their valley; but they did fust rate to trade with,  when you sweetened 'er with a mite of sugar  S 266   Is,                   .

Them I put into a store to Galveston, and traded for land, marked up my goods at what they was worth new, put on one per cent for pro- fit, and swopped for land, at fifteen cents an acre. Now the thing's all done, I don't mind tellin' I had jest about a clean five thousand in hides and wool, and Mexekin blankets, and notions-a sech as swans' skins, and young deers', and mockin' birds, and horn-toads, and tigers' skins, and a few young bears, and tigers, and possums, and coons, and wild-cats, and sech a cargo as I couldn't have got carried off by no captin'. So I jest hired a brig right out, give a free passage to some chaps-who was flat broke, and wanted to get back to York pesky bad-to help take keer of my meneygery; filled up with cotton, enough to pay all expenses, up killeck, and off for York; and there, between Phin. Barnum, and the show folks, and them Swamp hide fellers, and the Pine- street wool dealers, I cleared out my adventure in some less'n no time, and come out over three thousand ahead. Well, I laid out one thousand in bang-up new goods, four, in all sorts of traps, chips and whet- stuns; two thousand to Orleans, in sugar and cof-     <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6605-00000136"/> 268  MUD AND WATER-THE TOBACCO HUNT. fee; t'other thousand, in payin' expenses; got my r stuff over when all the blockade fuss was goin' th on; got my coffee off for three times what it cost; sugar, ditto and likewise; traded two years on my stock; got eight hundred head of cattle, and  a swapped off the rest for thirty-five thousand acres hi of land. Then I spent five thousand of the real pewter, buyin' old Texas money--cost from seven up to ten per cent.; and that's salted away, snug in a  barrel, in the vault of the City Bank, to Orleens; and one of these fine mornin's, I guess, you'll find it come up, all standin', right side up, with keer. t Sence then-and that's three year ago-me and Uncle Billy, and Cunnle Ting's been a tradin' a leetle in land; and now--seein' the floods a comin'--I guess we've all on us got about land, and stock cattle, and old red-backs, enough to  aford to hangup our fiddles, and wait for high  tide." "Sam," said Dr. Allen, "I don't believe you, you abominable cormorant and land-shark." "Well, Docter," replied Sam, "you jest ride over Pine Island parara, and Targentin's parara, and look for my brand; and then head Cedar  Bayou, down to the mouth; then over by Goose Creek, and round by Sprott's, to Lynchburg." "No you don't, Sam,"--answered Allen-"No   ECONOMZmG TOBACCO.     269 you don't; I've tried that confounded Circle Prai- 'ie, and don't do it again. I got lost there, for he first time in my life."

He got astray himself oncet on that dern no 'count, narrer con- tracted, make-believe of a parara. Open on it, Docter; Uncle Billy's a harkin'." "Well, you see, Unele Billy," commenced Dr. Allen, "I was staying on a plantation in the lower end of the prairie, and near Goose Creek. It was during the time of the threatened blockade; the Galveston people had taken fright, and many of their goods were sent up to' Houston. Coffee, sugar, and tobacco were very scarce indeed, and could only be obtained by paying an extravagant price, even if you found them at all. Our neighborhood, at last, was entirely out of tobacco; sugar we cared nothing for; coffee, it was very hard to be deprived of; but to exist without tobacco was " tolerable, and not to be endured." We had put off the evil day as long as we could, mixed our tobacco with old coffee grounds, economized and scraped all our pockets, but it came at last; there was not a pipe-full south of Goose Creek. We tried old coffee-grounds alone-no go; then    <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6605-00000137"/> 270  MUD AND WATER--THE TOBACCO HUNT. we mixed stramonium  with them, which did v4 somewhat better, but was not over-safe to indulge a in to any extent. At last we heard from some  i one that Bill Sprott was up from the island, and f had brought a supply of the needful.      of Lots were drawn to decide as to who should go after the weed, and Fate gave me the duty to T perform. The whole prairie was under water,  hi from knee to saddle-skirt deep. The mid prairie q was in a horrible fix, and there was no other way  left, but to ride near the timber of Goose Creek to tl the head of the east fork, swim the stream just te before it entered the timber, then down the other d( side to the junction with the other fork; up the east side of the west fork, swim the creek at the ti head, and then strike off diagonally through Circle  Prairie to Sprotts plantation.   i On the timber at the junction, and right be bi tween the forks, lived old Jimmy Sprott, an uncle c of the individual whose tobacco I had designs  a upon. Here I stopped a moment, to ascertain if it were not possible to cross the west branch, in d the timber, but was advised not to think of it, as b it was dangerous.                b, So nothing being left but the long route,   se through mud and water, I took it with the best t grace I could, and in four hours after I left old tl Jimmy's, and six from the time I started, I ari it   CIRCLE PRAIRIE.      271 ved at my destination-a distance of two miles in an air line from home; of five, when no flat was in the main creek to ferry us over, and we were forced to cross both branches in the timber; and of eight, when obliged to adopt the long route. I obtained my tobacco, and was off in a hurry. The sun had just set, and I was very anxious to head the first branch if possible before it was quite dark; so I drove the spurs into the sides of my wearied animal, and for a few minutes he threw the water finely; but, alas! it was but a temporary ebullition of spirit, and he soon subsi- ded into the stereotyped splash, splash, splash. This prairie is surrounded on the south by the timber of the bay, on the east by that of the main Goose Creek, and on the west and north by a suc- cession of mots of timber, of various dimensions, but so near together, and so exactly on an ellipti- cal curve, as to appear, at a short distance, to be a solid continuous line of timber. There was no moon, and night had no sooner drawn her veil over the heavens, than the clouds began to gather and the stars to disappear, one by one, from my anxious gaze. I had but one safe course to adopt, and that was to ride along the mots of timber until they brought me near the creek, then keep up the creek timber-giving it as wide a berth as I could, while keeping it in     <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6605-00000138"/> 272  MD AND WATER-THE TOBACCO HUNT sight, on account of the ngerous gulleys, half hidden in tall marais grass o the head; and then home, by the same route t t I came. The last mot of timber nearll oined that at the creek, and at this point the ream turned off at a right angle, and then curved way to the east. Slowly and weariedly my horse assed mot after mot. The last-the one nearest t e creek-. I had intended to avoid, and pass between it and the second. At last, I rode so long by te side of a piece of timber, that I was convinced I had passed my intended turning point; bu having passed, there was nothing to do but to kee on. Presently there was a clear opening bef re me. Dark as it was, I could see that; and in a mo- ment more I saw something that I did not like as well-bright lights upon the prairie-but a short distance ahead. When I had stopped at old Jimmy's, I found his boys making preparations for a fire-hunt, over the very ground where I then supposed myself to be, and if I rode nearer, there was no telling what risk I might run of coming in for a chance shot; so I spurred my horse into a lope, and dashed off for the lights-shouting as I rode. At last I was  answered, but the distance between us was greater  than I had supposed, and I could but just hear the   A HALT AND A TUMBLE.    273 voice. Two lights were stationary and one moved on. Suddenly, my horse stopped, and so abruptly as to throw himself almost upon his haunches, and me nearly over his head. He had planted his fore-feet so firmly in the soft prairie that it seemed as if they were intended to take root there-for not an inch further forward would he budge. I coaxed and urged, but all in vain; there he re- mained immovable, every now and then blowing and snorting, as if in fear. Now a horse is no fool-as you all know-and I was certain that something was wrong. It might be a gully ahead, or it might be a tiger-as we improperly call the panther. There had been one lately in the west fork timber, and Sparks' boys and I had heard him crying about sunset, a few days before. We had hunted until dark, but could not find him. If it was a gully, I had better get off and exam- ine the ground; if a tiger, I was quite as well off in the saddle. It would not do however, to turn my horse's head and alter my direction, for then I should certainly be lost; so, trusting to luck, I disinounted, and taking the caberos in my hand, proceeded to investigate the ground. I made a step ahead of my horse, and down I went, ten feet into a soft marsh. I picked myself up, and strained my eyes to 18    <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6605-00000139"/> 274  MUD AND WATER-THE TOBACCO HUNT. their utmost capacity in looking ahead. I knew then where I was. I had not only passed the last mot, but had followed round the creek timber-  down, instead of up stream-until I arrived at a place where the open prairie ran to the water upon either side, but between us and the water was a quagmire that would have bogged a blanket. The worst, the most aggravating, the unkindest cut of all, was, that one of those lights shone from the window of the very home that I had left at noon, the other at a near neighbor's, and the third had been borne by some one passing between the two-probably in quest of me and my tobacco. I do not know that I was ever more amazed in my life. I had matches with me, and by rubbing one smartly over my coat sleeve, obtained light enough to see that it was eleven o'clock by my watch. I had been paddling about in this prairie four hours and a half. I had been in the saddle, and wet pretty much all over, nearly eleven hours. My horse was nearly done up; self ditto.; there was home within a quarter of a mile, and no chance of my reaching it for the next five hours. It was becoming abominably cold, and besides experiencing that agreeable sensation, I was also very wet, muddy, wearied, and hungry. But a   A QUEER PILOT.     275 shelter I was determined to find; for having but just recovered from an attack of fever, a night upon the wet ground would not have suited my constitution at all. I knew that upon the edge of all timber a well defined cow trail is invariably found, and always upon the best ground, and such an one, I was very sure, was the path in which I stood. It would not have been safe to have followed it on horse- back, since I should have had my body ground against trees, and my head broken with low hang- ing branches, every few steps; and it was too abominably dark to avoid it, besides, I was afraid my horse would give out. I therefore determined to foot it, through mud and water, and that my horse should pilot me. So keeping him under my command, by holding on one end of my long caberos, I started him off upon the trail ahead of me, and away we went. He followed the track like a sleuth-hound, and on- ward, by the timber and through it; sometimes out in the prairie, heading the gullies; sometimes plunging down them and up again, I followed him until we arrived at the old trail, that led to the crossing in the timber, which I had previously avoided on account of its danger, but now I deter- mined to take the chance, I remounted tny horse; he knew the road well,    <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6605-00000140"/> 276  MUD AND WATER--THE TOBACCO HUNT. and in five minutes we were on the bank of the creek.  The first dash brought us in water up to my  saddle-flaps; the next, my horse's knees came in contact with a partly submerged tree. He made a regular dive-almost turned a somersault-and both of us went entirely under; for my, feet were out of the stirrups, and I, extended at length upon his back. In a moment his head was up, and puffing and snorting, he struck out furiously for the other bank. Having lost ground by our sub- mersion, we reached the other shore below the landing, and at a steeper bank. With a violent effort, the horse managed to plant his fore-feet upon the ground, when, catching hold of an over- hanging limb I swung myself ashore. After a severe struggle, aided by all the assistance in my power, the horse at last fairly floundered out, and stood upon the bank, trembling in every nerve. Putting him again upon the lead, through the timber we went, then down its side, and old Jim- my's field fence was before me. I shouted loud and long, for the boys to call the dogs off. At last they came-that is, both boys and dogs--my beast was taken care of; self ditto; and so at two o'clock in the morning, I found myself at the half way house-which I had left twelve hours before -returning to it a wiser and a wetter man; hav-   AN EXPENSIVE LUXURY.        2" ing learned, at least, to let Circle Prairie alone in the night time.

THE Ati IAOINTO RACES-THE LITTLE HERO AND THE BIG BULLY. "P I mighty apt to know ivry rod of that ar consarned parara, timber and all, said Uncle Billy. "What a blessed family them Sprotts wer-all but old Uncle Jimmy and his boys, pre- haps. They wer allers mighty docious, ondly when Captin Whiskey got his grip onto the old man. Prehaps I didn't hev a laugh at him oncet. I wer a drivin' down the prairie with about a dozen boys Id picked up on the Trinity, and a makin' for Sam Houston's camp. The Mexikins hed jest burned Harrisburg, and wer down onto the Bay, by Morgan's plantation, and the San Jacinto races wer a goin' on.

"Well, Majer," ses he, "ye see we all took a kinder skear, and thar wer a regler stampede agoin' on, and the old woman and me allowed we'd best vamos too; and now, ye see, I recken we'd best keep on." "You lie, Jim Sprott," bust out the old woman, "and ye know it. Whose afeard of Santanner but you? Thar's little Jim, he kin shoot a rifle on a rest; he ain't afeard; he wanted to jine the army -the stuffy leetle sarpent, and ondly just a risin' nine-and you, Jim Sprott, to be afeard of that yaller nigger, Santanner.

The old man sot out to be King of the Parara, and fer a while he wer. He ruled that neck-of-the-woods with his rifle, I tell ye. Them that stuck by him did well enough, but ef a settler wer stuffy enough to stand up to his rack, his fences wer tore down, his cattle shot down in the perara, and all sorts of divilment worked on him. Arter the fight at San Jacinto, things didn't work quite so smooth. Thar wer two pertickler settlers he never could let alone-old Docter White, that lived on the perara below, and a man called Bingham, on tother side the Bay. White had been abused so long, that he never looked for any difikilty thar, but Bingham wer a boss of another color. He had the best house and the best craps in the hull country, and everything snug and nice around him. I reckon he wer the first white settler on the Bay---wer allers ready to help the new comers, and hed got the good will of the Bay people-all but old Sprott and his gang.

Now, old Sprott wer a giant, big as Sam Hous- ton, and a mighty sight meatier-and Bingham war a small man, but rayther solid, and spry as a wild-cat. He hadn't but one eye, nither, and wer prehaps the last man you'd hev picked out to hev sot up agin Sprott." "Oho," ses Sprott, I've ketched you, hev It I swore I'd hev yer heart's blood if I iver sot eyes on ye.

Now thar wer a crowd in the room, but not a man could iver tell what hannened then. All they see, wer Sprott and Bingham down on the floor, and in hafe a shake Bingham broke through 'em, and wer in his dug-out, and pullin' for home, and thar lay old Sprott on his back-eyes and nose mostly stove in, blood a runnin' outer his mouth, and his face all a jelly. -Bingham did it all up so mighty spry, they couldn't see a thing, not rightly tell it wer all over.

The only boat but his on the shore wer Sprott's, and that he'd got in tow.  Well, they blazed away with their rifles, but i didn't faze him, and then sot out to hunt another boat to carry Sprott home with. When they got the old sarpent down to Sprott's Bay, thar were a file of sogers, sent by Sam Houston, to arrest the old man for piracy and murder-and he'd hev bed his neck stretched, ondly he saved his life, by dying in his bed. The awful beatin' and the fight, sot a fever a goin' and that wer the last of old Sprott. Betwixt the man he did fear, and the man he didn't, he got his settlement. A few days afore he got his whippin', he and his crowd were around to Docter White's, and went to work a killin' and a dressin' the Docter's hogs right afore his eyes. The old Docter wer a sorter quaker, and it took smart chaince of abuse to set his back up-but he wer powerful fond of pork-and this last divil- ment touched him in a soft spot. So, up he goes to Sam Houston, and Sam knowin' both the men, swar he'd see him righted-sent off a file of sogers, to take the old pirate, and they stuck thar tell he wer dead and buried.   CHAPTER XXVII. A RISE OUT OF JOHN BULL, AND THE WOODEN DOUGH- NUTS. "MR. BUNCE," I inquired, "pray tell me how you obtained the soubriquet of "Sam Slick?" "You've made a friend of him for life," said Uncle Billy, " sartin. He's been a. settin on thistles this hafe-hour, and a itchin to give tongue, no odds on what trail. He's all wound up like one of his own clocks; you've sot him agoin, and hang my picter, ef you kin choke him off tell he's clar run down." "Oh, psho, Uncle Billy," retorted Bunce, "I know a man about your size that kin spin yarns with any one, if he gits a chance, so don't ye go to throwin' stuns, not tell your own glass house is insured. The Squire there asked me a civil ques- tion, and that desarves a civil answer,--at least that's manners where I come from. 285    <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6605-00000145"/> 286    THE WOODEN DOUGH-NUTS. You see, Squire, when I first come to Texas, I brought over all the old traps I had; most on em things you couldn't sell nor give away, but I tell you, when I mixed em a lettle with a few new goods, and threw in a sprinklin of the pewter- pewter was pewter then, and a dollar as big as the side of a house-they all traded off first rate for cattle. Amongst other things, I had a dreadful big lot of old-fashioned wooden clocks, that wouldn't go nohow in Alabamy, but they went off here to kill. You see, when I traded with the folks, I never asked for cash pay, but allers managed to pay 'em a leetle, but then I carried off their hides, and they did me better'n money. Well, jest about that time, them most amazin funny books that the old Judge writ about Cousin Sam, got to bein' around putty much all over, and I bein' kinder proud of Sam, let it leak out putty much all round how near kin we was, only he's a plaguy sight the oldest ;-so, puttin' that and my clock trade to. gether, they jest fitted that handle to my axe." "How many of the old Judge's stories are true "I asked. "Well," said he, "I dunno; putty much like my Injin story, I guess. There's one thing certin as preachin', that if Sam's told him some things that didn't happen, there's an   A DROLL OARGO.       287 amazin' big squad that has, he did'nt let on about. Now that Atashy story's nothin' but moonshine. Sam went across, and he poked his nose in, putty much all over, I guess,-that's his way of doin' things. He's putty generally give up in our parts to be a leetle the modestest man in all crea- tion, and never does nothin' that he's ashamed on. There's some folks though, ses it's because he ain't ashamed of nothin',-but that's all envy. Now, Sam went to England on some curus kind -of specilations that nobody ever'd heard or thought on afore, and one on 'em I know he never leaked out to the Judge. He took over with him putty nigh a ship-load of clocks, and when the bills was made out, the makers was for puttin' 'em down amazin' low, but no ;-Sam said, "do the fair thing by Johnny Bull," and so the vally was sot down straight's a shingle. They was the first lot of Yankee clocks- that went over, and cost about a dollar and fifty cents apiece, take 'em all round. Well, the apprisers was peskily plagued to find out their vally, and at last said the invice was'nt right, no how-so they sot 'em down at five dole lars apiece. Now John Bull's got a law, or he had one then, that if a man thinks he ain't fairly dealt with, and    <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6605-00000146"/> 288     TH WOODEN DOUGH-NUTS. his goods is marked up too high, the country must jest step in and take 'em off his hands if he wants 'em to, and this is exactly the wrinkle Sam had got inter his head. He didn't set any snare for 'em, but jest did everything fair and above board. They sot the twich up, and then run their own necks in it,-jest as Sam knew they would. So Sam told 'em sence they put so high a vally on the article, he guessed they'd best keep 'em. It was about the cutest thing he had ever did, and the best spec he'd made so far, but that wasn't all. He had down to York a great squad of old- fashioned clocks, that he couldn't do nothin' with, so he got the story spread there putty much all over, and every body in the English trade went to buyin' clocks. Sam's sold for double what they  cost; they didn't keer what kind of clock it was; they was all intended for John Bull's benefit.  But he'd got enough of the first lot,-one was a dose, and a putty hard one to swaller. Sam see putty plain that this rule wouldn't work  twice the same way, so he went to work to cipher out some other case to apply it to. When he'd figured it all up, and sot it down, he pulls up stakes, and away he goes to Paris. There  he orders five thousand dozen of the very best su- perfine A. No. 1, kid gloves, all bang up and no  mistake. These he had packed in a way that \ / ./   THE RIGHT-HAND GLOVES.    289 made Mounsheer Bulfrog open his eyes wide enough. All the right hand gloves was put in one set of cases, and the left hand ones in another. The Frenehers sakrayed consideble, but couldn't make head ner tail out on't. At last, they bother'd Sam so bad, that he told 'em that the women folks in England was subject to a dreadful disease like in the hands, and they was often took off, so that single gloves sold fust rate there. When he'd got all ready, he had the cases of right-hand gloves shipped to a man in London, and ordered the tothers to be sent on to Liverpool, about a month arter; and somehow, the gloves was billed to him at about half what they cost. Sam ses he can't make it out nohow, sense he knows he paid the full vally for 'em. Now the duties on French gloves was awful high, a darnation sight more'n the flimsy things cost, and these duties Sam did'nt mean to pay. Well the gloves got to London- the apprisers marked 'em up like thunder, and the consignee wouldn't touch 'em. When the time come to sell 'en at auction, Sam was there, examinin' the goods, and putty soon he sings out: "Hollo I here mister, there ain't a pair in this box, they'r every blessed one on 'em made for the right hand." 19 j    <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6605-00000147"/> 290     THE WOODEN DOUGH-NUTS This sot 'em all to lookin', and not a pair was found in the lot. What to make on't they didn't know, no mor'n the Frenchers,--but sold the gloves must be, and sold they was, and for jest nothin' at all. When he'd got this part done up straight, off he shoved for Liverpool, and played. the same game. Then he sent both lots off together to some other town, and had 'em straightened up, and sold 'em for a monstrous big figger. It was most a grand spec, and a superfine rise out of the Bulls, that's a fact. The wool was pulled over their eyes a leetle the slickest, andno mistake. You never ketch Sam tellin' the old Judge any of them dreadful shines he used to cut, when he was growin' up. I've hearn father tell of some on 'em, and they do say he was gi'n up by all the old wimin to be the beatinest critter that ever was born around there. I guess the wooden-nutmpg, and bass-wood- pumkin-seed folks must have got their idees from him, for they do say afore he'was ten years old, he laid in with a boy who was sarvin' his 'prentis- ship to a turner, and got a lot of black walnut ao-nuts turned out. Sam took 'em hum, and coaxed old aunt Charity, -who was a kind of help, that lived to his father's   -to fry 'em, when she was makin' fried cakes, and they looked jest as nateral as life. Well, he took 'em to school, put 'em in his desk, and putty soon the school-ma'am ketched him, chompin' something behind his Daboll. "What are you doin' on now, Sam?" says she. "I ain't a doia' nothin';" ses he. "You needn't tell me that, you obstropelous young sinner," ses she, jumpin' up and runnin' to his desk, and there was the do-nuts, lookin' most pertikeler elegant and inviting "A fine lot you've got on 'em," said she, "ain't ye now, Sam? You must have stole all aunt Charity fried last night. What for goodness' sakes did you want with so many?" "I wanted to go a fishin', ma'am7, ses Sam, a whimperin' and a rubbin' his eyes with the sleeve of his jacket. "So, you was a goin' to run away, and go a fishin', was you?" asked she,--" now you be absent this week jest once, and I'll take yer hide off. Them do-nuts is confiskated accordin' to the rules of this seminary;--but stop, han't you got no cheese to eat with 'em?" '"No, marm,--I wasn't a goin' to eat 'em," says he.

When play-time come, she give all the children a do-nut apiece,-all but Sam, and she told him he could stay in and have the pleasure of seein' her eat her shere. She picked up one, and made a big bite at it-  and crack went two teeth, broke short off. "Oh, lordy massy!" ses she, a holdin' her hand to her mouth, "what's all this "  She looks right clus at the do-nut, takes her  penknife and whittles it a leetle, and jest as she picks up the ruler to dress Sam down, in busts the hull school, a howlin' and yellin',-some on 'em with teeth out, some with their mouths bleed. in', and one hungry chap had got his do-nut into his mouth, and couldn't git it out. When she'd got 'em pacified, and pulled out the do-nut, Sam was called up. "Now, Sam," says she, "this is your last caper. You've got to the eend of yer rope. I'm goin' to give you sech a quiltin' as 'll keep ye warm the rest of the winter, and then turn ye out of school." "What fer?" ses Sam. "What fer? ye deceivin' critter "1-  Why, fer bringin' wooden do-nuts here," ses she--" and ra- inin' my teeth, and the dear childern's, too." 1n1I1   SAM GETS A QUoLTNG.    293 "I ain't done no sech thing," ses he. "I brought a lot of floats for a small seine, that father told me to take to Uncle Nathan's, and you went and took 'em away. You touch me if you dare, and I'll tell father and the school-committee, how you take all our things, and keep 'em, and get yer dinners out of us every day." Sam had her there, and she began to be a leetle mite skeared; so, ses she, in a milder way-  "How does it happen, Sam, that these floats have been fried?" "To keep the water out, so's they won't rot," answers he. "But why didn't you tell me, when you saw me tryin' to eat 'em!" "Cause," ses he, " you told me you'd quilt me, if I open'd my head." "So Sam got off then-but havin' to go round and tell the turner's boy what the upshot of the matter was, it happen'd that the story got hum afore him. And when he come to the barn, his father was standin' in the door, and give him an invite to come in. "Now, Sam," ses he, "I'm goin' to quilt you.

"Look heah, Nutmegs!" asked Uncle Billy, "Wer your Cousin Sam the man who first speci. lated in wooden hams?" "Not by a jug-full," replied Bunce, "that was done by some cute feller out to Kentucky I guess." "I have seen some sharper things done than dthat," said Mr. Wiggins. "Hoopee! ef Wiggins hasn't opened his head," shouted Uncle Billy. "Why, stranger, I reckon'd you wer a kinder dry bayou, swaller'd all you could git, and never let none go; but yer on a trail now. Open away, and give tongue, like a good feller,"     CHAPTER   XVIII. SHARP NANOXERING, AND DEAR INDIAN MEAL. "THE smartest business affair, to -my knowledige, and the one which, though small in itself, produ- ced the most important results," commenced Mr. Wiggins, "was intimately connected with the re- sumption of specie payments in '42. It was honest, too, or at least what business-men call honest. At the house in which I boarded lived a very shrewd Yankee, who had come out there to intro- duce some new kind of roofing, of which he was the patentee. The man's name I think was Kel-  log, or something like it. One day Kellog wanted a little change, to use in paying off his hands, and so went into the Citi- zens' Bank, and asked them to oblige him with silver for a five dollar bill. New Orleans French- men are never particularly civil to any but their own caste, and a Yankee is their especial abomi- nation; so that Kellog received a short and insult- ing refusal. 295    <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6605-00000150"/> 296 SHARP FnOMANUERN  AND DEAR INDIAN MEAL. -He retaliated pretty sharply, hard words fol. lowed, and he was ejected from the bank. As he went out of the bank he told them that they should pay for this, and they did. Kellog was about ready to leave for the North. In a few days he had closed up his business, and collected his money, amounting to about three thousand dollars. This he soon changed into five. dollar bills of the Citizens' Bank. The next step was to retain an able lawyer, and one who was willing to carry on his suits in the lowest court. In this he succeeded. As to legal advice, Kellog did not want it. He had spent many a night in turning over the Lou- isiana statutes-that alone governed the decision of the inferior courts-and soon made two grand discoveries. Their laws may have been since changed, and from the results of these very suits, but I know that they were in existence then. First-That the holder of any bill of exchange or post note, or bill of any kind for money, could, in case of default of payment when due, collect from the maker or makers the amount, double ex- change, and double interest-which would be six- teen per cent. per annum. Second-That in all suits for an amount not ex- ceeding twenty dollars, the decisions of the infe- rior courts were final, and did not admit of appeal.   A PRECIOUS BOW.     29* Kellog instituted a separate suit against the bank for every five-dollar bill in his possession. The bank employed the ablest counsel in the city, but perfectly in vain, and Kellog gained the suit on the first bill. The bank then " caved," and offered to take up the remainder of the notes with specie-but no; Kellog would have every jot and tittle of his pound of flesh, principal, inter- est and all the legal expenses that he could pile on. The bank would not pay at first; but an exe-' cution upon their furniture brought them to their senses, and Kellog left New Orleans as soon as possible, with quite a little fortune. The suit was brought on upon a Monday. One week from that date the New Orleans Banks com- menced paying specie, without giving any pre- vious notice. The other solvent banks in the country were obliged to follow their example. Municipality money was thrown out, and went down very low indeed. For an entire week, we had the greatest riot that New Orleans has yet seen. Then the waves subsided, and the stream of finance has since flowed smoothly on, only somewhat checked at times by low water. Kellog, who was a very talkative man, had kept this matter to himself until the very day of the trial, and then asked me to be present. I could    <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6605-00000151"/> 298 SHARP FINANCIERING AND DEAR INDIAN MEAL. not believe him, but he was confident that he would carry his point, and he did.  It was singular that I should have been in some manner connected with the commencement of the  suspension of specie payments, as well as with i their resumption.                i In the last part of the Spring of '47, I returned to New Orleans, from the prairie regions of the  State. It was on a Sunday when I returned, and I t was to leave on the next day for the North. I had  with me quite an amount in bills of various banks in New Orleans, Natchez, and Vicksburg. I in- tended to have given them to the clerk, and have 1 taken up country money from him when we ar-   1 rived at Cincinnati, but desiring some specie, I  went into a bank in Canal street, "The Merchants'  and Mechanics' Bank," I believe-and offered them four five-dollar bills, of which three were on that very bank.  The teller counted me out fifteen Mexican dol- lars, and threw back one of the bills, saying-  1 "they had enough to do to pay their own bills, without cashing those of other banks." "Indeed, Sir," said I, "if you're so badly off as that, I think I shall prefer even the "Mexicans" to your bills, for travelling companions,-here are three hundred dollars-I will thank you for them in specie-would prefer gold." -   SHELLING OUT.     299 You'll get no gold in this shop, stranger," said he, "and I'd pay you in coppers, if I had them." So as I could get neither gold nor good treat- ment, I sacked my dollars in my handkerchief, made for a broker's office, and found gold four per cent. premium, Northern sight exchange four, and United State's bank-bills six. Mississippi money, the man assured me, was " no whar ;" they had bought on Saturday, but declined it then at any price. I had just time to draw the specie on what other city bills I had, and to reach the boat as they were hauling in the planks I selected all the Natchez and Vicksburg bills, and handed the rest to the clerk, requesting him to pay them out  as soon as possible. Among our passengers was a man who had a government draft upon a Natchez bank, for two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, and also a heavy draft on Vicksburg. This was casually  told me by the clerk. The moment of our arrival at Natchez, I jumped on shore, took a carriage and drove up town in  haste, got my bill turned into specie, and then re- turned myself. It was the last of the bank's specie payments; i the government agent was close behind me; I met  him as I went out. The bank could not honor the  r ;        X        IiS    <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6605-00000152"/> 300 SHARP FINANIERING AND DEAR INDIAN MEAL. draft; he protested it; the bank suspended, and down like a pile of bricks went every one of its congeners--north, south, east and west. I cashed my Vicksburg bills also, and the same day their banks closed;---so-you will see I can justly say that I was in some manner connect- ed with both the suspension and resumption of specie payments." "Say, you! quit that " roared out Bunce, jumping up in a hurry, "Who 'n thunder 's been pourin' water down my neck?" "There, there, my son," said Uncle Billy, pat- ting him on the back, " there; now don't go to cavortin' r and here. No one's poured ar'y drap of water down yer neck. Ye've been asleep, Nutmegs, and it's sot inter rainin' like a day's work,-jest listen; ain't thar a gush on't comin  Ef ye will go to sleep right under a leak, lay yer consated head on the table, and leave a hole atween yer neck and that dern no-'count shirt collar, ye mustn't mind a drap or two findin' their way in." "Drop er two," retorted Bunce, " wish I may be chizzled if there wasn't a bucketful; but it does rain powerful, that's a fact. Judge, heave on a stick or two on our fire, will ye? and Uncle Billy, you've stuck to that are old peach long enough-jest pass it along."   CREEK WITHOUT A MASTER.    301 Having refreshed himself, Bunce turned to Wiggins, and said: "Well, now about them cute rises, you was agoin' to tell on." "Why, bless your lively-lookin' picter, Sam Slick," exclaimed Roberts, "heah's the little marchant been a talkin' like a book, and a tel- lin' true stories to your Uncle Billy,-he liked 'em, he did; none of your no'count or'nary iholawagos yarns, and you've been a snorin' away like an old he-bar in a hard freeze, with his paws in his mouth. Why, man, ye purred ekul to a young painter." "Oh, let Sam alone," said the doctor, " an' jest inform me what you mean by " holy waggon?" "Holawagos, stranger,-holawagos," returned Roberts, "that's Creek."

Arter awhile they begin to larn the meanin' to their own words, and play 'em off on us, as piert as a puppy, and that didn't pay not hafe so well." "Well, gentlemen," resumed Mr. Wiggins, "since Mr. Bunce did not hear me, and as my story was not of the wooden ham species, with your permission I will relate one that is." "Good as wheat, fust rate," interrupted Bunce. "Some years since I was descending the Mis. sissippi on the old Madison," said Wiggins. "We were drawin' near to Mills' Point, when I observed the captain and clerk on the hurricane deck, ex- amining, with a spy-glass, the crowd assembled at the landing, and also evidently very much amused at something. "Up on the-wheel I clamber'd, and so to the spot where the officers were standing. As I came up the captain asked--- "Can you see him now?" "No sir. Stop--stop! yes I can. He has not found us out yet. Now he has though, and is taken with a leaving immediately." Being well acquainted with the captain, after the boat had made her landing, left, and was once more steadily moving down stream, I determined to get wind of the fun. "Captain Freeman," said I,--" if not an impro- per question-"I should like to know what was   A PERSEVERING CHARACTER.   303 going on at Mill's Point just before we landed, that amused you and Finch so much." "Oh!" he replied, "it's a regular game that we have with a man named Smith, here-uncommon name, is'nt it-a small dealer in country produce, but the most self-important man on the Point. For years, at whatever time we landed-morn- ing, noon, or midnight-Smith was the first man on board, up at the clerk's oice, inquiring for letters and goods, which-as he had neither friends nor acquaintance above nor below-he was not very likely to receive. At last we brought up a cask of wine-vinegar for him, shipped by a Mills Point man, who had gone down with us. If half the cargo had been consigned to Smith, he could not have made more fuss about it; and from that day he annoyed the clerks, mates, and me, by insisting upon it, that there must be something on board for him-demanding to look at the manifest, overhauling the letters, and raising Cain generally; so that I determined not to stand it any longer, and brought him up a brandy pipe filled with water, a bill of lading from an imaginary person, with sundry charges specified on the margin, amounting to twelve dol- lars, and made out a freight bill for three more. He paid his fifteen dollars, received his brandy-    <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6605-00000154"/> 304 SHARP FIANCIERING AND DEAR INDIAN MEAL. pipe, and has never troubled us since--not that he i has in the least lost his taste for boarding steam a ers, but he don't like the old "Madison," and when  he makes her out, invariably takes the shute." b "He was well sold," said I. "How came you  ] to think of it "                fi The captain looked at me with a queer twinkle 1 in his eye, and said-"I'll tell you, if you promise st to keep dark. I paid for learning. Not long be- n fore this happened, two young men came on board at New Orleans, who had thirty pipes of gin to ship to a leading house in St. Louis. They trotted about the Levee to every St. Louis boat, trying to beat down the freight, and finally, as I was nearly full, and anxious to get off, we took the lot very low. There were marginal charges, for freight from New York, insurance, cartage, storage, &amp;c., amounting on the whole to over three hundred and fifty dollars, which the clerk paid. When the "Madison" arrived at St. Louis, the con- signees knew nothing about any such shipment, but took the casks and paid the charges-which, by-the-way, we had the pleasure of refunding afterwards-for the casks proved to contain noth- ing stronger than Mississippi water." "Well, that's some," said Bunce, "but 't aint quite up to what I read on in a Orleens paper,   DEAR INIAN MEALn .    805 when I was down to Galveston t' other day, how a chap shipped fifty ceroons of cochineal, went with the man who forked over the pewter for the bills on Liverpool, cut one of the skins open, and showed a most a splendid article-jest about the Fust best, the, man said-put three thousand dol- lars in his pocket, and marvel'd; and when the stuff got across the water, it turned out that forty- nine outer the fifty was filled with injun-meal." 20 o    <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6605-00000155"/> CHAPTER XXIX.
