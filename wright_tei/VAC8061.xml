And even my Pro- legomena will not pass muster in this behalf. Where- fore, though you will, not read this preface, and do not care a straw why I have written another book, I may as well say, briefly, that I was mainly encouraged so to do by the reception of "NAO's HEAD," and by kind letters from older brethren, among which is the follow- ing:-- "SUNNtSIDE, Sept. 17th, 1850.  MY DEAR SIR- "Though I received in due time your letter dated  August 11th, your book did not reach me until within a week past. I thank youmost heartily for the pleasure  afforded me by the perusal.

We were  fortunate for that matter, in comparison with others, that came straggling in like a covey of partridges, scattered by a sportsman and his well-trained pointer. We. had escaped with so small an injury as the springing of the head of our foremast, while one vessel, that-anchored near us, had been dismasted. They reminded me, as they flocked to the anchorage, of the frightened land., birds, which one sees flyingto a ship's rigging, when blown off shore'by a westerly gale. They seemed eager to be once more at rest; and, the busy, useful, homely, Lilliputian canal-craft nestled to the wharves as if they did- not feel safe, even there, from the fury of the still raging storm'   -  One of these last lay near us. She was:a schooner of- possibly forty-five tons.

She-rode uneasily on the tossing waves,  ? which were most literally casting up mire and dirt; and I kept up a fussy, fidgety clatter of ropes, and' creaking of  booms, and rattle of blocks, and slamming of cabin-doors, I as if she longed to hug the dilapidated, rat-haunted "old  wharf, and thus to feel that she was safe.  She must have been built since the flood. I have just re-perused the whole of the Scripture His- tory from the first chapter down to the resting of the ark, and I am ready-to make affirmation that no such craft existed before the building of that vessel; for, if there had been such a specimen of naval architecture, traion would never have suffered the moss to grow over its memory. It is more than probable that she had once boasted a coat of paint, of many colors it must have been, for there were not only spots of palpable red, and green, and black, but shades that, I am very sure, were never legitimately begotten of any of the primary seven. There was a streak of red about the hawse-holes, that gave her a rowdyish look of late hoursand gin-drinking; and a" glimpse of her bottom, as she rolled testily on the soiled swell exhibited a shocking scarcity of ship drapery, of both sheathing and copper. She :.was, moreover, very manifestly leaky; whether fromn some " typhon on" the raging canawl;" or from   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.         15 the more stormy billows of the roadstead above the hos- pital, I know not. Certain it is that there was a tall cadaverous man, with an antediluvian- hat, and a com- plexion that assured me 'that he -had -been shaken. well nigh to death with what Shakspeare 'calls- a burning quotidian tertian, that it is most lamentable to behold" -the ague and fever videlicet-who pumped by the hour. He worked so steadily that I began to think him a part of the machinery of the vessel, until he rose suddenly upright, pulled off the venerable hat, whose years should have prevented the indignity, and, throwing it furiously on the recumbent barrels of shad,  exclaimed:- "Dod dog the leaky old tub! Je-rooz-lum! Ding it all to dingnation! Ain't I ben pumpin' here, I should like to know, for the last three hours?

The smoke curled sluggishy, and in huge volumes, from the dilapidated old galley, and added fresh swarthi- ness to the dark, smoke-embrowned, water-soaked sails. The tiller stuck fiercely up, at an angle ofifty degrees. It was lashed amid-ships; but the ruddegoaned, and squealed, and thumped in the casing as if itiul-l' shake the sticks out of her."This would have been vnoexy difficult matter; for they were, of a piece with the'ill.

The bowsprit stood horizontally and defiantly out; its nose battered out of all its original lines of form. The windlass looked as if it had-survived' an attack of para- lysis; and the cable might, "to all human appearance," have been made in the smithies of Tubal Cain, the " in- structor of every artificer in brass and iron."

It nestled touchingly and filially (it was almost full of water) to the parental side, with a look of uncomplaining dejection, approachingto resignation and meekness; as if it had desperately resolved, and expected as a matter of course, to go down to ' the ooze and bot- tom of the sea" with its decrepit mother. - NORFOLK. "So, this is Norfolk, eh?"I exclaimed, as I ended my examination of the Betty Warren, and looked 'slowly ^'/  * -   A  mUMO-OUS NOVEL.       17 around me. The water, as far as the eye could reach, was discolored,and filled with veins of mud. On shore; everything loolked bileak and deserted-as most things do in 'the first days of March; and the hospital was a redeeming feature of the scene as it gleamed pleasantly in the beaiis of the morning sun. The smoke-was blown fiercely aside from the chimney-tops, without ever a curl, for all the world like. the white locks of Lear, in "The peltings of the pitiless storm," asyou see them in pictures; going horizontally off" into thin air;" whirled and twisted, at last, into impalpable shreds by the fury of the gale. Our single anchor began to drag, and we let go our best bower. With two anchors ahead, and a scope of forty fathoms on the smaller, our good schooner then rode more quietly at her moorings. It was fortunate for our venerable companion, the Betty Warren, that she was well in shore, where the warehouses protected her, in some measure, from the fury of the wind. As it was, she rolled and pitched as if she were wrought into a tearing passion by the obstinate pertinacity of the easterly gale. She threw her nose high in air, now and then, as if she would have said, with her most contemp- tuous sneer, "I hope you don't call this 'ere little fluster a gale o' wind!"  And then she would bend her head low down, burying- her wrinkled and battered cheeks in the muddy swell; shaking her unkempt locks, the unfettered running; rigging and Irish pen'ant's in the wind, like a beggar on a market day in March. It was Sabbath morning. The church bells were ring-  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8061-00000008"/> '18        BERTIE:!  ing pleasantly their sober peal. Some half-a-dozen young men, with whiskers and gossamer canes, all in clerical black, -were ounging under the lee of thewarehouses, to enjoy rest and sunshine at the same time. There, too was theehard-handed, laborer, with his neatly-clad little boy; -the holiday finery and "shining morning face" pleasantly in tune with the warm sunshine, which was lending a sombre beauty to even a March landscape. The rude wind had kindled a ruddy glow upon the faces of both; and they seemed to, be enjoying with hearty zest the free gifts of Heaven's breath and smiles, outside of brick and mortar. As we could not immediately go on shore, I went into the forecastle. One of the crew was writing a letter; his table being constructed out of a couple of trunks. The labor, I ventureto say, was more formidable. to him than making up the bunt of a topsail. He bent his head starboard and port, like a polka-dancer; wrinkled and distorted his phiz; thrust his tongue finally between his teeth; stopped now and then, and then went on, as one who takes thought what he shall write. His pen leaned fearfully over, like the masts of a pinkey in bal last; and he crossed the t's and dotted the' is with much the -same gravity, and deliberation, and stateliness, with which Burleigh is said to have nodded. When at length he had finished it, he laid the pen, with gin- gerly circumspection, across the inkstand, leaned back and rubbed his hands with a look of immense satisfac- tion, as if he had, unlike Keyser, survived a burning at the stake, and been called a "great doer" by Luther himself. Had he been classic in his readings, he would have broken silence, and said :-   A HUMORDOUS .NOVEL.       19 "Hic extremus labor; htec meta viarum!l" As it was, he merely said- "There, I guess I've got that 'ere bloody thing done and backed ship-shape!" Little Frank was snoring lustily in his berth; resting as pleasantly upon his hay-bed, and underneath his rude coverlet (the boat-sails), as if he were reposing upon the: down of the cygnets of the Ganges. Commend me to genuine physical toil, and a hay-bed! There is nothing like them in the whole world. And then the conscious mesmerization into the broad, sunlighted land of dreams. Sancho Panza should have ridden out a north-easterly gale in March, on the North American coast, to have uttered," with due emphasis, and sound discretion,' (do I quote it rightly?) his memorable benediction upon "the man who invented sleep." '.Eight hours in the lee scuppers, for three or four successive nights; a few hours a-day! at the pumps; and his trick at the wheel, during two interminable hours of rain and sleet; and there would have been a ringing, tingling, stirring em- phasis in his tones when he said, "Blessings on the man who invented sleep! It covers one all over so-like a garment!"  Anon, the news-collector came off to us. He reported many accidents of the gale; and after some conversa- tion with the. captain about our own damages, the propri- ety of a protest, and a telegraphic dispatch to the owners, very politely offered me a passaget to he ferry-wharf.. I packed my trunk, and bade my ship-companions good- by. In half an hour I was in snug quarters at my hotel.  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8061-00000009"/> 20         BERTIE: CHAPTER    II. NORFOLK-A   NEW  ACQUAINTANCE. "Urbs iNTitwAV fuit." "Leave patience to the gods; for I am human!" RICnELIEV. BEAUTIFUL, romantic Norfolk'! I like Norfolk. I like its staid, quiet, ancient air of Quaker-like garb, and re- spectability, and neatness, and substance, and comfort. Whole regimentsdoes it muster of fine women and charm- ing girls. For the midshipman, it is Eden; for the epau- lette-Elysium. Old ocean has an arm  half way around her, in a doting embrace. A little way from the brick and mortar barrenness of the business thorough- fares, you come to the shrubbery and flowers, and roomi- ness of residences. Farther still, neat white cottages, with wealth of rural attractions, peer pleasantly from the  evergreen woods; inviting a glance at the vine-covered trellis, or a bright eye beyond it. By moonlight, Norfolk is enchanting; and of a mild summer night, the moon's "golden haziness" falls as beautifully there as at Rio  Janeiro, or Naples; on Melrose, or the Rialto. Such, at least, was my opinion when I was returning, one evening, during my brief sojourn from a walk through the more frequented streets of "'The Ancient Borough.' All the world was walking by moonlight. Here, a gray- haired old man was leading merry children along the                  .   i       A HUMOROUS NOVEL.        21 crowded thoroughfare. The pale, thoughtful student sauntered slowly on ; busy, apparently, in investigating the mineral properties of the dilapidated pavement be- neath his feet; while above, there lay the whole heavens, like a silver sea, with isles of gems. Manhood and I beauty went side by side, and over- all the throng there I was the witching of the soft moonlight, giving to furrowed  brows the air of beauty, and to " ruins gray" the charm of proportion. A fair young girl passed me. A profu- i sion of dark curls fell upon her neck and shoulders. Her form was of faultless outline, and her step that of a sylph. Her darkeye glistened, as she leaned lovingly and trustfully towards a young officer, whose uniform glittered in the moonlight as they sauntered along. Ever and anon, the young lover (I was sure he was an accepted suitor) drew his form proudly up to its full princely height with an air of defiance; as if an ungentle look from a passer-by at that fair girl would have provoked him into an "incensement" like that which Viola was taught to expect in the blood-thirsty, fire-eating Sir Andrew Aguecheek: "So implacable that satisfaction could be none, but by pangs of death and sepulchre!" I caught myself " sighing like a furnace ;" and was turning to goto the hotel, when I was somewhat familiarly accosted, in the unmistakable twang of eastern Maine, with  "Haow dew yaou dew?' I accepted the proffer of a broad, hard hand; and re- ceived a shake that would have delighted the sage of Quincy in his most vigorous days.  "I am quite well, I thank you," I replied, a little cere- moniously.- "But H--"  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8061-00000010"/> 22         BERTIE: "O, ya-a-s! Exactly.

"Professor Matters," said I, a little mystified, "I am happy to make your acquaintance. May I ask what chair you occupy at the present time?" "Hey?" "I mean, what college you- " "O ho! now I understand ye. I don't zactly b'long to no college; but I'm a professor of what minister calls hydrology. ' I was now thoroughly mystified. "I hope you'll excuse me for takin' so much liberty; but I knowed you was a Yankee, and so I thought I'd speak tew ye. It's a rale' satisfaction tu me tu meet a man that walks as if he'd suthin to walk for; and not like these 'ere sleepy Southerners, that walk jest as if they'd had the yaller fever. I won't keep ye, thoughl," added he, seeing that I wasgetting uneasy; " good night! May be we'll see one 'nother ag'in."      ! '"May the gods avert it!" said Ii devoutly, as he turned away; and I returned to the hotel with the reso- lution to leave Norfolk on the following day. I made the ' proper inquiries of the clerk. There was no vessel, he i said, going South, sooner than -the day after the morrow. 1 On the following day, a friend invited me to visit the  Pennsylvania. I declined; giving as my excuse the fact that I had often been on board of her. "But there are some ladies going on board." "That alters the case." "You'll go?" "Yes." /    A HUMOR OUS NOVEL.        23 "Sharp three, this afternoon." "Very well." Accordingly, at three o'clock, I found a gay party in the act of embarkation at Ferry wharf. Two of the 'Pennsylvania's cutters, with their gay pennants flying, were alongside the wharf; and both were closely stowed with ladies and gentlemen. "Shove off there, forward," said Lieut.? ; 4let fall! -give way!" and our neatly dressed boat's crew bent to their oars. We were welcomed by a march from the band, as we reached the accommodation-ladder; and, as we stepped on deck, were most politely and cor-- dially received. The few necessary presentations were I got through with the ease and tact belonging always to the well-bred gentlemen of the quarter-deck. There was no parade, no bustle, no fuss, As the dinner-hour had not yet arrived, we strolled about the decks of the noble ship, and our fair neighbors were initiated (somewhat briefly and imperfectly, if the truth must be said) into the names, uses, and mysteries ofd ivers parts of the armament and rigging. I was in unusually good spirits that day. Chance consigned to my civilities Miss Rosalie D ,a charming young woman, whose acquaintance I remember as one of the pleasantest in my life, and who, alas!- has married and gone away to the far South. May she live forever! We had a delightful chat. I had answered her thousand- and-one questions about the ship; and was getting into rather a dangerous habit of looking into her eyes-there was never a finer eye in all the world-when, just- as we were coming out of the commodore's cabin, there ap- peared to me, hat in hand, and with a smile that en-  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8061-00000011"/> 24    -      ETIE:    - gulfed all other dimensions in the single one of open- Ai ness, my friend Professor Matters.

SHO ! ye don't say so! Commodore, you can take my hat !" On one of these occasions, he actually offered the vene- rable hat to the commodore. As he did so, he caught a E glimpse of a letter inside. " I never showed this letter, I b'lieve, commodore," he said, as he looked at the superscription. " That's from my friend Professor Jinkins. You may read it ef yew want tew."

"Don't say nothin' !" said he, as the roar subsided. "Don't mention it! I'll stand treat all round !" Never before or since has the ward-room of the Old Pennsylvania so rung with loud, long, irrepressible laughter. To describe the scene at the dinner-table would be too long a digression. I must defer it for a future day. We returned on shore. In the evening, as I was chatting with mine host, I heard the bell of a neighboring church. "Is there a meeting?"-I asked. "Yes; at Mr. A    's church. Would you like to go?" "Very much.    I have heard something of Mr. A     .o We went to church. The house was thronged with " the beauty and fashion" of the city. Mine host's pew was speedily filled, and the services had already com- menced, when, with a look as sanctimonious as that of Joseph Surface, in came my friend the professor. He stopped at the door of mine host's pew (who politely gave him his own seat), nodded familiarly to me, depo- sited his hat, and, drawing forth an immense bandana, so flourished it as to draw upon him the inquiring gaze of the congregation. He, all-unconscious (apparently so, at least), fastened his eyes upon the preacher. The hymn was given out. The professor declined the proffer of a hymn-book, and pulled from his pocket a book of his own, which, to judge from its appearance,   might have been used in- the days of the covenanters. The tune was Old Windham. 0 ! Handel and Haydn ! 0! the Boston Academy! 0! Spirit of sweet sounds! With an earnest zeal, not according to knowledge, and an exertion of lungs which sent the blood to his cheeks and forehead, the professor broke ground in the opening notes of Old Windham. Loud, shrill, sharp, fierce, unmitigated, and remorseless, like unto "The notes that erst blew down Old Jericho's substantial town," partaking the lulling soothingness of complaining saws, in their teething agonies, the softness of the notes of donkeys, and guinea-fowls, and peacocks, intermin- gled with broken-winded clarionets, tin horns, the voices of belligerent cats, and the breaking of much crockery, was heard the professor's voice. It was all fortissimo; no cadence, but unbroken "monotony of wire;" with now and then a nasal, tremulous shake on some note, a whole measure behind the choir. It met you like a dry north-easter, in turning a corner, on a February day, in the City of Notions. Elderly people looked puzzled-waggish people looked interested-humorous souls were in a state of what is sometimes called intense fructification-the minister rested his head on his hands --the deacons frowned--the girls tittered-while, for myself, I bowed my head to the book-rack, and held my aching sides. The day is long past; but now and then, as I have done while writing these lines, do I live over again the roar of laughter in which I indulged that night, as I laid my head upon my pillow.  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8061-00000013"/> 28         BERTIE: Having decided to leave Norfolk in the morning, I  went to the clerk, and gave the necessary directions : about the disposal of my baggage. I remember the in-  tense satisfaction with which I congratulated myself on the skill with which I should spring the mine on my new and somewhat over-sociable acquaintance. I do not now recollect, however, whether or no I had ever heard of the proverb which recommends people not to shout until they are fairly out of the woods.; or of that other which speaks of coming for wool and going home shorn. If I had, I must here confess to the reader that I had either wholly forgotten the same, or else that the seed of wis- dom had fallen on stony ground. I was early astir the next morning. The clock told five as I stepped to the office. "I hope Mr. Seaworthy has found his stay in Norfolk agreeable," said the polite clerk, as the porter lifted my trunk. "I thank you. Too agreeable, by far. I should have been away a fortnight ago." "You take passage in the Betty Warren?" "Yes.  "I'm afraid you'll find a dull berth of it; and, if it rains, you'll be sorry you didn't wait for a better vessel. There'll be a dozen of them going out in a day or two."

Scuse me, sir; but 'ud you 'low me to look at that 'ere map?' "Certainly," said I; and I turned to lookat my neighbor. He had removed from his head the, most di- lapidlated white hat which I have yet seen on the Ame- rican continent; deposited tlei same on the counter, with as careful a solicitude as Brummel would have laid a- cravat in the same place; and, without any signs of re- cognition, drew a pair of rusty spectacles from a greasy i case, adjusted them, held the map off at arm's length, and gazed thereon in utter abstraction.

The hair was long, and of raven black- i ness; and a long, matted lock hung obliquely over a y which Uncle Ned, immortal in song, had never "a hair of him for memory." His eyes were very dark and piercing, but intelligent and good-humored withal; !and his whole cast of features and frame betokeied more than ordinary vigor of body and mind.

I drew a long breath of relief at my escape; paid for my map, and was speedily on board the Betty Warren. I found all hands swaying, with might and main, on a huge cask in the hold. The captain informed me that there had been some mistake in the stowage; and that it was therefore necessary to break out a part of his cargo. He would get away, he thought, about one o'clock. I returned to the hotel; passed the morning with the news- papers; and, on my way to the vessel, between twelve and one o'clock, stepped into Myers' for a lunch. I had finished it, and was paying for it, when, forth from the stall adjoining my own, adorned, as before, with the never-to-be-forgotten white hat, came my friend the pro- fessor.. "Ah!

His mate had engaged, he said, to take another passenger; but if he, the passenger, were not on board in time, the vessel would not wait for him. I will not hazard my reputation for veracity by under- taking to say how often I consulted my watch during the two succeeding hours. At last, at a quarter before three, Captain Ragsdale came puffing along with the last of the stores, and gave orders to get under way. "B'low there!" "Heelo!"

And he pointed to a truck which had just made its ap- pearance on the wharf. On it were two barrels, and, as I found on a nearer approach, a bald, cadaverous, de- jected, superannuated hair trunk. There was a trifling delay in getting the barrels on board, as they proved to be of enormous weight; and the skipper had, it seemed, no other resource than to cut the mousing of the peak halyard, and use it (the halyard) for a fall. At last the baggage was on board. The barrels were stowed amid- ships, and the trunk was borne to the cabin. I caught * A negro says "Name John ;" never "my name is," &amp;c.

In the hurry of getting under way, none had noticed the threatening cloud; but it was evident hat we were about to encounter a severe squall. It was not long in coming; and, fortunately for us, we had neared the opposite shore so as-to be well under the lee of the buildings. As it was, the violence of the squall was such as to part the jib-halyard, and down came the sail, shivering and flapping with a fierceness that seemed ikely to tear it into shreds. High uprose the voice of the startled skipper, in notes carcely less loud than those with which Satan is said o have called to his prostrate legions. "JE-ROOZ-LUM!

Blacksmiths whistle.  Tailors are taciturn.  Carpenters are quiet. Shoemakers are merry; but your sailor, or waterman is almost always a singer.  If he be unable to sing, ten to one that he has a rickety old accordeon, violin, or an asthmatic flute, with which he offers whole hecatombs of slaughtered crotchets and quavers upon Apollo's altars.

I suppose it must be motion that provokes this musical development; for your stage-coach driver is always a singer. The quaint and somewhat mournful strain of the dri- vers seemed to have awakened a responsive chord in the breast of Captain Ragsdale; forhe came pensively down the ladder while I was making some notes of the day's occurrences in my journal, and took in hand with gingerly care an old flute.

Thirds, fourths, fifths, octaves; intervals before unheard of,-and never since spanned by human skill, poured resistlessly forth upon the startled air, and the old canal, unconscious of a flood, Whose dull, brown Naiads ever sleep in mud" seened to simper its smiling approval by the faint dimple that gathered in its swarthy cheek. The professor was delighted. Strength, and not skill, was evidently his, musical standard. Sam Hines and black Lazarus came aft, and sat down near the door. Primus, too'; a negro who was at the helm, was evidently beginning to neglect his duty, so absorbed was he by the, music.

Be that as it may, I could hear, in my half-waking repose, the monotonous song of the drivers; their emphatic blows on the "unfed sides" of the jaded mules, and their chir- rupping, intermingled with divers epithets and persua- sives not proper to be set forth in this history, to quicken the cattle's motion. Captain Ragsdale conjured forth the crickets with his orchestral snore, and the smoke- browned little cabin rung with their song. The rats were performing "Lavoltas high and swift corantos" behind the bulkhead; the tow-rope rustled over the low shrubbery on the bank; the rudder squeaked, and . the water curled and eddied in a low musical ripple beneath the counter. Ever and anon, the professor would start feverishy from his troubled slumber, with a hysteric, "Oh! O dear!

So far, the Dismal Swamp had been anything but dismal.

The morning wore pleasantly away. The professor i busied himself by some abstruse calculations with pencil i and paper. I wrote a letter and a page in my journal.

He would look, now at the pro- fessor's cabalistic formulas,-now at the motions of my pen; and then, after a brief consultation with the shaggy little terrier, both the dogs put their paws on the highest step of the ladder, and gravely observed our mo- tions.

As I went on deck at noon, we were passing the hotel, not far, if I mistake not, from Lake Drummond. The-stage-coach drove up. There were two or three gentlemen inside, who seemed quite too languid to get out; and I caught a glimpse of a fair girl in a mourning-dress, whose head was bound tightly with a handkerchief. Light as was the load, the horses-three leaders abreast and two wheel-horses-ambled slowly and wearily along, op- pressed, like ourselves, by the sultriness of the wea- ther. At length, as we were finishing our dinner, down came the rain. It began with a thin and almost impal- pable drizzle. "I'm mighty 'fraid we're guoin to hey a wet time on't," said the captain, as he donned an oil-cloth jacket and sou'wester. "What do you think, professor?" "I think we're goin' to hev an etarnal drizzle, an' no mistake!" He was not far wrong. The rain came faster and faster; the tow-path was speedily a mass of mud; the mules and their drivers, as well as the man at the helm, were dripping with water; the dogs looked wistfully into the cabin; and the captain came below, and sat moodily down, with his head on his hands, evidently an- ticipating "a wet time on't ;" and knowing full well, by sore experience, the sad import of the expression. We discovered, to our great disappointment, that the cabin leaked. But one single corner was there where the drops did not ooze through the deck. Thence it trickled along the carlines down upon our heads. As fortune  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8061-00000022"/> "         BERTIE: would have it, the corner in which Professor Matters and myself were sitting proved to be passably dry. Night carne on; and, after a late supper, we en- deavored to contrive some plan for a night's rest. To  sleep in the berths was out of the question ; for the rain  was dropping merrily into them, and we had been obliged before nightfall to roll up the bedding, and stow it away in -a locker. We spread a matress upon the cabin floor, shut the doors, and betook ourselves to repose.. I be- lieve some grammarians reckon repose among the active  verbs. I beg leave to say that I favor that classification. Never, to the best of my knowledge and belief, have I so vigorously endeavored to sleep. I counted whole thousands; I listened to the pattering of the rain; I held  my eyelids firmly together, and resolutely ignored the  fact that the professor was beginning a snore, which, if I might judge ex pede Herculem, would, prove a perfect typhoon when the drowsy god should fairly encompass his plethoric proportions in the emphatic hug of the " wee sma' hours." I groaned aloud at the very thought of it. "What's the matter, neighbor?" asked the professor, in a sympathetic tone. "Nothing at all, I thank you, professor; but would you oblige me by turning upon your side?" "Which side?" "It is immaterial;, say the left side." "The left side it is. Good night!" "Good night, professor." "Pleasant dreams to ye!" "Thank you." Vain is the help of man. Blessed is he that expecteth   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.         47 nothing. Forth from the professor's nostril, ab imis sedibus, come forth the clarion notes, now in a strain which might relatively be musically [denominated pianis- simo, now in a crescendo movement; it swelled like the north wind in a Carolina forest of pines, to forte and fortissimo; now plaintive, "As when Scotchmen grind undying notes upon hand-organs," now sharp, short, decisive; stirring one's blood like the shriek of a bagpipe in extremis; now long drawn, sustained, like a colonel's shout to distant squadrons; now crisp, abrupt, emphatic, startling; now-but will the reader pardon the futile effort to describe it? He has but to take down Horseshoe Robinson from  the shelf (if it were at hand I would copy the extract), and read how that hero snored, on a certain night when the heroism of a girl savecd both himself and Butler from threatened peril. The "grunt" and "snort" of Gal- braithi on that occasion, might-possibly aid the imagina- tion of the reader in forming some faint conception of the manner in which the professor made night hideous to me. We made but little progress. The cattle were jaded, and they crept wearily along in the mud, possibly two and a half miles the hour. Once, too, in passing another boat, we got aground; and it was a long time before we got under way again. The captain came below and kindled a small fire; but the wood was wet, and it hissed and sung, and smouldered, and flickered, until he gave up the attempt. I had risen upon my elbow to witness his exertions, and I maintained the same attitude after he stepped out upon deck and closed the cabin-doors. Old "Lonzy"  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8061-00000023"/> 48         BERTIE: crept in unperceived, dripping all over with the rain; and, setting his feet broad apart .on the cabin floor, he gave himself so vigorous a shake that his ears and tail were for the moment invisible. The weight of the showe fell upon the upturned countenance of my happy fellow.- lodger! He rallied a little, and drew the sleeve of his coat (neither' of us had undressed) across his lips, and rolled over. It would seem that the captain had not fastened the cabin-door; for I heard the terrier scratching for admittance. In a moment more he succeeded in ef. fecting an entrance, just in time to escape a wrathful kick:from Lazarus. That worthy was at the helm, and th -:blow he meant for the terrier fell harmlessly (to all save himself) upon the cabin-door. I could hear him groan a moment after, "Ah--h--h! Cricky! Plague take de feller! I bin broke my toe, sartin! Dod dog de luck! Gwine torain for eber, I b'lieve!" All unconscious, however, of the perils he had escaped, the dripping terrier, whose every particular hair looked as if it were conscious of the apostolic injunction to-,' come out and be separate," paused'in precisely the same place where "Lonzy" had. paused a few minutes before, and again the rains descended, and the floods came in a blinding shower upon the face of the snoring professor. "Connecticut RIVER-! Scissors! H-1!" roared the professor, "who done that 'ere?" And so saying, his eye fell upon the poor terrier, who was now getting into the proper attitude for the second shake. In the dim light of the smouldering fire, he seized upon the nearest object (it chanced to be one of -         ,J;   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.         49 his own boots) for the infliction of due chastisement. Had the blow reached the poor terrier, there is no telling how soon the author of these pages might have had oc- casion to write his epitaph-- - S Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit." He had the discretion to vanish-and he survived. The blow, however, upset the oil-can, and left it, bottom up- ward, in the capacious leg of the professor's remaining boot. I feigned a sound sleep. It was not until he had felt for a long time, on a table and in the locker, that he found the lamp. This, after much asthmatic expendi- ture of breath, he lighted, and took a deliberate survey of the cabin. "Je-rew-sa-lem," exclaimed he, as he partially open- ed the cabin-door. "How like all natur it does rain! Sleeps like a top, that 'ere feller!" dooking at me). "Darn that 'ere tarrier! Hello! Hel-lo! HEL-LO!- Here's a go now! What's this 'ere in my bute?

I guess you might 'bout as well lay down and git another nap." How I survived the convulsion of laughter with which my sides were aching, and how I restrained it, I know not. The professor, however, had not, apparently, dis- covered that I:was awake. He left the lamp burning, stretched his brawny limbs beside me, and was soon asleep. He had left the cabin-door ajar, and presently a goodly stream of water trickled down beneath him; 5  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8061-00000024"/> 50         BERTIE: while, from a new leak overhead, the big drops began to fall upon his heaving breast.      ^   , The night had become cold, and I stppose I ought, in all charity, to have awakened him.

He pricked up the wick of the lamp, and, in its mo- mentary gleam, the venerable, beaver was foundwith about a pint of water in it, resting as coolly and quietly as if it belonged there. The professor was not long, as may be readily supposed, in emptying the hat, and then he threw it down upon the cabin floor, with a wrathful vigor that I shall never forget.  "Cuss the rotten old thing! It eenamost makes me swear. I wonder what time it is?" "Half-past two, professor." "Half-past tew. I wish it was six. H" The professor's eloquence was here cut short by the arrival of Captain Ragsdale, who informed us that, if we would put up with such accommodations, (!) we might go into the hold. A part of it was dry, he said, and we could sleep there better than in the cabin. "No doubt on't!" responded the professor. We carried our bedding into the hold, and, to our infinite delight, slept uninterruptedly until seven o'clock.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8061-00000025"/> 52         BERTIE: We found ourselves at South End.

We were so fortunate as  to be able to lay our course into Albetnarle Sound, and, just at nightfall, we let go our anchor abreast of the pretty village of Edenton. I now flattered myself that , I should escape the professor. I took leave of him, and i evaded his questions as to my destination. On reaching the hotel, I learned that it was court week; and the a obliging landlord was pleased to say that he had but a  single vacant room; but that that was at my service.  He might be obliged, he added, to give me a fellow- lodger; but would not do so, if he could avoid it.  I then made some inquiries about my uncle's family.  He knew Colonel Smallwood very well, he said; and . would send me across the Chowan in the morning.  "Could he send me early?" I asked. "As early as you please." "Say, at four." "At four." "Will you breakfast here?"          "A mere lunch, if you please; toast and coffee." "Good night, Mr. Seaworthy."' "Good night, Mr. Bond." I may have been abed an hour. I was just falling, at  any rate, into a delightful sleep, when a tap at my door  awoke me. "Who is there?" "Open the door one moment, if you please, Mr. Sea- worthy."    A HUMOROUS NOVEL.         3 I did so. Mine host, for it was he, apologized for disturbing me; but said that he was full, and that they were full at Hathaway's ; and that he was, therefore, obliged to ask me to take a bedfellow. , "Was it a gentleman of his acquaintance?"I asked. "No. A stranger." "And you have no other bed?" I  "Not a bed in the house but what has at least two I in it." "Well, then, it is but for a night. I consent." Mine host disappeared. A servant soon afterward made his appearance with a venerable trunk which I thought I must have met before, in my travels; and while I was endeavoring to decide the query where it could have been, I heard the step of-the owner in the passage. I first saw the top of a white hat (not, as it seemed from a hasty glance, in the best possible state of preservation), as the new-comer stooped to enter the low door. The head was then lifted erectly, and a loud "HEL-lo! why, how DU you DU?" was a whole book of revelation as to the name of my bed-fellow. "Why, what's the matter? sick?" "Yes; I am somewhat indisposed." "I'm trewly sorry; anything I kin dew for ye?" "No; I thank you." "When du yaou git away?" "It is uncertain." I now called the servant to me, and asked him to wake me at three. He promised to be punctual, and left us.  "I hope I shan't disturb ye," soid the professor, as he drew off his boots. I've ordered a bucket o' hot wa- ter. Don't feel very well myself; and so I thought I'd 5*  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8061-00000026"/> 54         BERTIE: soak my feet.

The boy called me at three. Dressing in all possible i haste, and as silently as I could, I left the professor, as I verily believed, in the arms of sleep. After a hearty breafast, I embarked. I followed the plan I had pre- i vioisly arranged. I landed at Plymouth; sent my trunk  back by the boat to Col. Smallwood's; went to Windsor a to transact some business; and, about four o'clock in the  afternoon of the following day, set out, on horseback, for i the CYRESS SHORE, the residence of my uncle.  i   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.        55 CHAPTER V. ," AULD ACQUAINTANCE."--THE ARRIVAL. "My home! my home! my happy home!" SONG. I HAD sent to Cypress Shore, together with my trunk, a note to my uncle, Col. John Smallwood, apprising him of my arrival, and requesting him to send a horse for me, to Windsor, on the following day. The reader who happens to know the geography of the region of which I am speaking,will perceive that I passed very near (in sight of it, indeed) my uncle's house; for it is not two hundred yards from the head of the sound, between the mouths of the Roanoke and the Chowan. It will quite as easily be seen that I went leagues out of my way. In making this detour, I had several objects in view. One was to avoid my new friend the professor; anotherw to visit an old friend, Dr. Jeffreys, of whose change of residence I had not heard; and another to execute a commission for a New York merchant to his factor in Bertie. Not finding Dr. Jeffreys at home (he had recently re- moved to a plantation near my unele's, known as Under- wood"), I went directly to Windsor, where I arrived about ten o'clock on the sare evening. I have known the time to pass "on angel-wings" there ; but the earlier hours of the next day seemed interminable. 'My horse about ten o'clock on the same evening.

In winter, spring, or fall, which is to say in rainy  seasons, it is a good three-hours' drive from Windsor to i: my uncles residence. Such was the case at the time  of which I speak, the twenty-ninth day of March, 1849; - and my horse gave some signs of weariness as he "pad- i ded the way" in the silent shades and utter loneliness l of the giant pines.

"They are aalways melancholy   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.        57 pleasures, those of memory," saith James; " for they are the rays of a star that has set." Even so. There are few things that waken for me more pleasant, and by 'r lady! sadder recollections, than the remembrance of divers walks and rides (not to make the remotest allusion to the person or persons-isn't that lawyer-like?--with whom they were enjoyed) through the magnificent pine-forests of " the good old North State." I am digressing. I rode but slowly, and it was near nightfall when I reached the post-office, which, I re- membered, was about six miles from Colonel Small- wood's. I had passed it, and had just entered the woods again, when I heard the clatter of a cart behind me, and the sharp and somewhat urgent chirruping of the driver.;  Whoever he was, he was manifestly in a hurry; for I heard now and then a whack of a stout whip somewhat vigorously, not to say devoutly, administered. Think- ing it not quite civil to turn my head to witness the ap- proach of the new-comer, I reined my horse out of the road, and made him slacken his pace for the stranger to pass. On he came with a clatter that made my horse somewhat restive, and, as he rode up abreast of me, my ears were greeted with "Human natur! Is this yaou?" "I am laboring under the impression that it is," I replied, as coolly as I could say the words. "Wall, ya-as! I thought it must be yaou; eenamost know'd 'twas yaou. How've you been?"

I wished it had been the cholera. "Good evening, sir; it's getting late, and I must ride on." So saying, I plied my horse with a touch of the spur that nearly cost me my seat, and left my friend the pro. fessor at a round gallop. I had ridden possibly a mile at the same rate, when, on reaching the brow of a small hill, I saw my uncle's carriage and grays, and, on a nearer approach, old GRIEF, the coachman. "Ki! Maussa Greg'ry, for sure!" exclaimed he, as he removed his hat, and gave his knee a curious slap with it.  The colonel's gray head and rosy visage now issued from one door of the carriage, and a bonnet that I was sure I had seen three years before, and which, even then, Iconsidered a venerable relic, betokened the pre- sence of the colonel's maiden sister, my aunt Corny, at the other.-  "How you ben, Maussa Greg'ry?" roared Grief. "Hello! Gregory, my boy! how are you? Glad to see you. Hold up, Grief! where the devil are you driving to?" shouted the colonel. "Why bless me, Gregory! Why don't you hold the horses, Grief! I do believe they're going to run away! I'm, so glad to see you, Gregory! Why didn't you write? Come this side; Molly's dying to see you." Then followed a general and particular shaking of hands, with the more affectionate greetings to my Aunt Corny and little Molly Smallwood; this last being a curly-headed, rosy-cheeked, bewitching, mischievous, frolicking girl, and an adopted daughter of my uncle.

He took my horse, and I seated myself beside my Aunt Corny, with Molly on my knee. "Drive home, Grief," said my uncle. Grief had driven out of the road for the purpose of turning, and the carriage was standing crosswise in the road, when, at a short distance, I saw Professor Mathers standing upright in his cart, and endeavoring, appa- rently, to restrain a rickety old skeleton of a horse, then smitten with the marasmus. He had, by some means, persuaded the animal into a gallop. "Whoa! hold on, yaou darned fool! I do b'lieve yaou'll run intew that 'ere carriage, spite of all I kin dew. Childern of Is-- " This last exclamation was cut short, as, apparently, in utter despair, he reined the horse into the ditch by-the roadside. Whether such were his design, I know not. He was leaning back, at an angle of forty-five degrees, in the apparent effort to stop the horse; and when the wheel ran into the ditch the cart upset, and the professor leaped from it with an agility which surprised me. He fell headlong, however. We got out of the carriage, and. as we approached him, he had one knee tightly against his breast, and his arms around it in a frantic hug.  "-h-h-h!" groaned the professor. "Are you much hurt?" asked the colonel.

"Thanky, ma'am; I feel quite re- lieved. Oh-h-h!" (Here was another groan.) "Will yew let that 'ere darky help me git my cart int' the road?" "Most certainly," answered the colonel, whose sym- pathies were somewhat excited; "and, as it is now sunset, you had better drive home with me, and take a bed." Thank ye, kindly!" groaned the professor; "but I'm on my way to Colonel Smalley's, or Smallwood's, I b'lieve it is. Kin yaou tell me where 'bouts he ties up tew, Mr. Seaworthy?" "So! you're acquainted, eh?" said the colonel. "Come--the boys have got your cart into the road,I see. My name is Smallwood, and I am probably the person you wish to see." The professor accepted the invitation. We reseated ourselves in the carriage, while he mounted his cart; and in less than an hour we were seated by a cheerful fire at the old family mansi6n.

"You are always busy, I believe, Aunt Corny," I said to her, in one of the pauses of the conversation. "O yes, Gregory.

As he passed me, a mo. ment afterward, his mouth displayed its whole inventory of interior decoration, as he said "Ki! ben gwine 'stracted, sure's you bawn!" As I have already intimated, I had not seen Cypress  Shore for about three years. My uncle had given me repeated invitations to make my permanent home there. For reasons which would be of no possible interest to the reader, I had declined ; but I had, until my last voyage, paid him a regular annual Christmas visit. Having some curiosity to-see what changes might have taken place, I called old Ponto from his kennel, and ordered -old Peter to saddle a horse for me. He had not forgot- ten my preference, it seem'ed; for the horse he led' to the rack was none other than brave old Hampton-one of a, thousand among horses. He was a large and' beautifully formed horse; coal-black, spirited; worshiped by all the negroes, who declared uinanimously that "he knowed a heap." I mounted and rode towards the fishery. This, I may remark, in passing, is 'about midway be- tween the mouths of the Roanoke and Chowan, than which there are none more beautiful rivers in the whole South. It was a most delightful morning. At intervals, between   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.         67 the pines and cypresses on the shore, I could see the sound. There was not a ripple on its broad surface, and it looked like a golden sea, in the gorgeous flush that overspread itsface at ihe first fierce glance of the "the old day-wearied sun.'"The air was musical with birds; a jolly negro was making the woods ring with a quaint song; a distant pack of hounds were in full cry; and anon came the fresh breeze from "Old ocean's gray and melancholy waste," to stir my blood with, the pulse of boyhood. Old Hamp- ton snuffed it too; or was it the long-drawn cry of the hounds that provoked him into a friskiness and jollity unworthy his years? The scene recalled to me'many a pleasant recollection of my former visit; and I more thanihalf resolved th ac- cept my uncle's long-slighted invitation to make my home, with him.  . "O! the South! the South! the beautiful South!" I exclaimed aloudi-as I rode along; and Old Hampton hing his head, threw back his ears, dropped into a drowsy amble, and at length put an end to my revery by a very inconsiderate start at some imaginary danger on the shore of the sound. Its shores were already a scene of bustle. The fishermen were out in their bat- teaux, and the mules were in motion at the first wind- lass. Behind me was  The Old Field."  The Old Field!

My revery wasagain disturbed by the braying of the hounus. Old Hampton raised his fine head, and bounded away.  The whole pack was soon visible. Several gen- tlemen were galloping behind them,; and in a few mi- nutes I was side by side with the hunters, among whom I met with hasty but right hearty greeting from old friends whom I had last met at my uncIe's table. We were in v ,   A HUM-OROUS NOVEL.        69 at the deith. Engagements for days to come were made, and I turned homeward. I paused a moment at the gate for a view at the old family mansion. The northern front is not nearly so attractive as-the southern. The trees which- had been recently'planted, at my last visit,were npw finely grown; and it was evident that another month. would make-the spacious lawn one of the most beautiful -spots in the world. The house was large, painted white, and furnished with dark-green shutters. Huge chimneys were) built 'at both ends outside the house; and, on the northern side, a -broad piazza, sup- ported- by half a, score of columns, extended along the whole length. A hospitable deal bench, ran along the weather-boarding; and at one end of the piazza was a sort of shelf attached to -thel balustrade, on which a neat unpainted bucket, with shining hoops-and bail of brass, was always standing. In- a hole of this same shelf, fitted .for the purpose, was the 'ewer; and near this, on'.a roller, was a towel white as the snow. Through the centre of the building ran a hall, some ten or twelve feet in width. I may be permitted to say here, for the benefit of my northern reader, who may not have seen'. the south, that, for three-fourths of the year, the hall and the porch of a southern mansion are in constant requisi- tion. You sit, lounge, or take your siestat in either. Both, but more commonly the piazza, serve you for your promenade.

As I dismounted, Haw Professor Matters in earnest con- versation with my uncle. They were coming from the Lot. This is the -name, by the by, given to the inclo- sure, surrounded usually by fhe sheds and stables, where the horses, mules, sheep, and cows are gathered at night. The professor had his hat in his right hand, and had, apparently, the weather-gage of the colonel, who walked slowly along with the abstracted and somewhat irritable air of a man who is very reluctantly being con- vinced of what he considered, at best, a somewhat doubtful proposition. I gave little-heed to the matter at the time; and I only mention-it here by way of prepar- ing the reader for subsequent developments in my story. Little Molly and my Aunt Corny met us as we as- cended the steps of the piazza. Grief announced break- fast, with ,his profoundest bow, and we gathered around the table. My Aunt Corny, I discovered, had persuaded the colonel into the custom of saying grace, afact that surprised me a little, inasmuch as I knew that nothing could restrain his expletives when he was in a ,testy humor. It so happened that, as we approached the table, the professor was conversing with me. When the- colonel bowed his head, and began saying the custom- ary words, Professor Matters took it for granted that the remark, whatever it might be, was addressed to himself. Turning so hastily around that he did not perceive my uncle's devotional posture, he said, abruptly- i What'd yaou observe, colonel?" "D--n it, sir, I was saying grace!"   A HUMOROUS NOVE;L.        71 Aunt Corny was horrified; the professor looked peni- tent; little Molly was mystified; and, for myself, I was nigh joining the colonel in his boisterous roar of laughter at the cotic mingling of the devout and the profane.. Conversation, however, soon took its isual quiet vein, and the mishap was forgotten. If your business will admit of it," said my uncle, addressing the professor, "I shall be hapy to have you spend a few days with us." "Thank ye, squire, or, I believe, they call, you colo- nel; PIm very much obleeged tew ye for the invitation. Guess I'll stay; for I've 'aPays wanted to know some- thin' 'bout this 'ere southern country." "I ar right- glad to hear you say so," replied the colonel; " and we shall take. a great deal of pleasure in doing what we can to make your stay agreeable. I impose but one condition, which is that you make your- self at home. There are the guns, powder, and shot in the hall; the fishing-gear hangs in the carriage house; Grief will bring you a pointer or setter; or a horse, if you dare to ride. If it be agreeable to you, I propose to take you to the fishery this morning." "Yew couldn't suit me better." "Well, then, Grief, order the horses. Saddle Broorn- straw for Professor Matters."

For, questionless, a transition from perils of shark and perils of hooks, from perils of dogs and perils of guns, from perils by land and perils by sea, from perils of nets and perils of spears, to a state of comparative certainty, if not of safety, free from any the slightest element of fear or suspense, is, I take it (admitting the poetical premise), very decidedly a kindness to fish, flesh, and fowl.

Quod erat de. monstrandum     . ' 'The horses were soon saddled. I saw, in the nervous preparation of the professor, that he was not much accus- tomed, it at all, to the saddle; and was thus somewhat prepared for the over-vigorous spring which he made in mounting, and which carried him entirely over the horse. A second effort was successful, and off we went. Broom- straw, by the by, was a fine hunter; a strong, square-set, and very spirked horse, on which a man might find it amusement to charge a battery. I knew very well that he was occasionally " frisky,' especially if he happened to hear the hounds; and 1 was sonewhat surprised that the colonel had ordered him for our guest. In the South, however,it is taken for granted that everybpdy can ride; and it had not, probably, occurred to my uncle that the professor might be less accustomed than himself to the saddle.- I:once thought of exchanging horses with my uneasy neighbor; but it was a delicate matter to broach;   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.        75 and, besides, I remember that old Hamptoin had a way of taking the bit in his teeth that was not very convenient for an unskilled rider rand I knew that should he. take a fancy to do so, on that particular occasion, he would give the professor a.

Directly. beneath us was the house, to which, until that year, the colonel had regularly removed his family,  and in which he had been accustomed to reside some six : or eight weeks every spring.

At intervals along the beach were eight stout windlasses, used. for hauling in the seine. They were turned by nules. The seine was about twenty-two hun- dred yards in length; and the warp was so adjusted by cringles, as to gather "the haul" into a, f6w yards of the centre, so that the part of-the beach on which the fish were landed was. but about fifteen or twenty yards in length.. 4  When we reached the shore, the warp was on the X second windlass; and, as it takes four hours to make a single haul, the reader. will perceive that we had abund- ance of time to show the professor the lions of the fish- ing beach. The. boys were riding on the windlasses, and lashing the mules into something akin to activity. Some of the men were getting their batteaux in readi- ness, while others (among them, a few women) were cut- ting, cleansing, and salting down the fish. The cutting- bench was placed beneath a shed erected for the pur- pose; and there were some hundreds of fine shad upoh it. We descended to the beach. In conversation with the overseer, Mr. Barney O'Brien, whom we shall beg to' introduce to the reader by and by, and who was then'superintending the fishery, I met an old acquaintance, none other than Mr. John Butter- ton-Dr. Squire Butterton, to give him his usual title-a friend and crony of my uncle's, and his nearest neigh- bor.

"Thank ye," he replied. -"I calkilate I kin ride  anything in the shape of horseflesh.:" .And he leaned far [ back in the saddle, braced both feet out in the stirrups,  and gave a pull on Broomstraw's bit to which he was not accustomed, and to which he was determined not to  submit. He reared suddenly, and the professor bent I -                     Xn t i   A tHUMO'ROUS NOVEL.       81 hastily forward and grasped the mane. He then threw his feet out of the stirrups, evidently with the- intention to throw himself from his saddle. Before he could do so, Broomstraw was in a fast gallop; and back to. our ears, in faint and half-smothered tones, came the words "Wha-a-a! Je-rew-slum! Childern of Isril!" Somewhat uneasy for the consequences, I left the colonel to ride home at his own pace, and, giving X Hampton the spur, was soon in chase of the professor. As if chased by fiends did Broomstraw shape his course for the hounds; the professor clinging; with a drowning man's hug, to the mane,; nor did the fiery gray pause until he joined a-knot of fox-hunters, then in full chase and coming directly towards me. As they came up, the whole group were in a roar of laughter; in which I most heartily joined as I wheeled old Hampton into line. It was. nearly a half hour ere we drew rein; and the pant. ing gray then gave his rider a chance to dismount.

We dined, and, while the colonel was enjoying his pipe and siesta, the professor accompanied me in a walk along the shore of the sound. In the evening we went to the fishing-beach. The torches were blazing, and the shores of the sound were gleaming, far and near, with similar lights. The cut- ting-bench had just been cleared of fish, and a group of negroes were gathered round Grief, who had brought his violin, and was then playing a merry old'reel that infused into rheumatic limbs, and younger sinews, a genuine fever of excitement. Old Harry Hog, the swineherd, accompanied him with the banjo, while another clapped his hands in time. I undertake to say that Professor Matters never before saw heels and legs and toes in such vigorous, ecstatic, indiscriminate activity. At any rate, he said very emphatically that he had never seen the like "to Steventowni," and that it "beat all natur."

In a pile of musty old volumes on the table was the "In- genious Dreamer's--good iold John Bunyan's-Divine Emblems; or Temporal Things Spiritualized; fitted for the use of Boys and Girls." It was dated so far back as 1808. :I pored dreamily over it awhile, and then gave my eyes a holiday, by thinking of the Pilgrim's fortunes on his way to the Eternal City. Like his cham- ber, in the Mansion of the Good Interpreter, mine looked towards the sun-rising; and like his, too, at that hour, its name was Peace.

In dim and shadowy array I beheld them marshaled, silent, glittering, when, lo! one long, loud shout, "'The noise of wings like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty; the voice of speech as the noise of a host.' And so thoroughly real was the scene to me, that I leaped to my feet, every vein tingling with excitement, the hot tears gushing to my eyes, as I exclaimed, "Q! shade of brave, heroic, lion-hearted, good, glorious old John Bunyan, peace to thee! I bless thee! Live forever!" My revery was .broken. I threw open the shutters. The thin crescent of the waning moon was looking down upon the earth and sea, with an air of aristocratic cool- ness, and utter absence of all enthusiasm, eminently worthyof the first circles. Below her beamed the morn- ing star with a flood of glorious light. Thin, mist-like clouds floated lazily here and there. The' cocks began their fierce, shrill, pulse-stirring matins. My little fire burned drowsily, though musically and socially, with a low, kitten-like purr, while ever and anon it gave a short,   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.        91 sharp, choleric snap, like a gouty alderman in an easy wind. My candle had burned low, well nigh to the socket; and its expiring flicker threw my shadow into huge, unshapely, ever-changing. proportions upon the wall. A faint glow appeared in the horizon. A long streak of bright sky succeeded it. The clouds flushed into thejsemblance of magic isles of a golden sea; the glittering rays fell in a flood of glorious light upon land  and sea; and I rose to my feet, and welcomed the sun- rising. As I have already said, there was no one stirring ex- cept the servants when I left:my chamber. Blind old Alice, the greyhound, met me as I took my hat from the hall-table, and followed me in mywalk along the shore. I walked well nigh to the mouth of the Cashie. The sun was far up in the sky when I returned; and I remember thinking, as I climbed up the bank, how keenly I should relish my uncle's substantial breakfast. I believe I have not yet mentioned the fact that my uncle's mansion had a large basement. This was di- vided into various apartments. One of these was Bob's study, or sanctum, to give it his own appellation. Ano- ther was appropriated to Old Penny (Penelope), the laundress; and still another was used as a store-room. The piazza was sufficiently high for a person of ordinary stature to walk erectly underneath it. As I approached the house, I saw a group standing near the door of the laundry. The colonel was standing beside my plain-looking Aunt Corny, while a little in front of them stood Professor Matters, apparently giving directions to two stout negroes, who were making quite a large excavation (some forty or fifty square feet possi-  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8061-00000045"/> 92         BERTIE: bly) in the earth. As I approached still nearer, I saw the professor stoop lowdown, in the act of giving di- rections. I was about to ask Aunt Corny, in whose face I saw the unmistakable indications of a forthcoming vo- lume of explanation, the meaning of it all, when I was very suddenly and most unexpectedly interrupted. My uncle, it seems, had recently purchased of a Ver- mont wool-grower, through his agent in New York, a large Mering ram, and several ewes. As I afterwards learned, they had taken the premium at the State Agri- cultural Fair, as they passed through New York. The silver cup, I may add, in passing, still decorates the parlor mantelpiece in my uncle's house. It appears, moreover, that the colonel had petted the sheep out of all reasonable bounds. He fed them, salted them; played with the big-horned ram (he was always called "The Sheep" at Cypress Shore), and suffered the little negroes to tease him, for the sport of seeing them scamp'er when once old Butty's ire was stirred inth aggressive warfare. The war was thus, occasionally, very literally and pre- cisely, and vigorously carried into Africa. Now, it so happened that, in my eagerness to see the cause of the unwonted commotion beneath the piazza, I left the gate open. Old Butty, being of a Paul-Pryish inquiring turn of mind, and, out of all question, some- what experienced in the pursuit of knowledge under difficulties, took a fancy to follow me int6 the yard. This he did, as I have since learned from Old Ditah, in a very gingerly style, with many a glance of anxious inquiry at the group beneath the piazza. As chance would have it, the first object that stirred his belligerent propensities was the hinder man of Professor Matters,   A IUMOROUS NOVEL.        93 as he bent low over the excavation (then about three feet deep). 'The more immediate cause, mayhap, was the red lining of a dingy old surtout of the professor's, in which he was then intrenched, and which is destined to make some figure in a future chapter of this veracious history. Whatever it was, in defiance of all the acknow- ledged etiquette of modern warfare, and in utter insubordi- nation to the articles of war, Old Butty retreated to what appeared to him to be the precise distance for an effect- ive charge, gave. his. diminutive tail a short, abrupt, wrath-instigated wiggle, and like a war-horse that smell- eth the battle, bounded towards the unconscious profes- sor in the pas de charge, lowered his head, and" charged home upon him!" The first glimpse I caught of the professor\after I saw him falling headlong into the hole, I saw him prostrate between the twh negroes. They, too, had been knocked down by the professor's momentum, anid were rolling in a convulsion of laughter, while he was spitting the soft earth from his mouth in a paroxysm of ire. "Patr'archs an' prophets!" sputtered he. "Ding it all tew dingnation! Who done that 'ere?" And he bounded vigorously forth.-from the excavation, with a very wrathful look of inquiry. There was no reply, for nobody could speak. My Aunt- Corny was in tears of laughter. The colonel had sank down on a bench, and was holding his head on his hands, in the attitude of one of the? principal figures in Hogarth's picture of the "Laughing Audience," in helpless convulsions; while what little physical strength refmained to me I. wholly lost, on seeing the professor seize old Butty by the horns and roll him several times over and over upon the grass.  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8061-00000046"/> "         BERTIE: There was no grace said that morning at breakfast; for although the colonel and his grave sister had some- what recovered their composure, nothing could check the titillating giggle of the romping, laughter-loving Molly. The charming little girl would now and then assume a lookr of staid, demure firmness, not unworthy my Aunt Corny herself; but then she wauld, in the next moment, burst into uncontrollable peals of genuine, contagious, ringing, boisterous merriment. In this, to do him justice, the professor very good-naturedly joined, with the air of a man who wishes to make the best of a personal mishap. When, at length, the incident was forgotten, I again asked for the explanation which I was on the point of demanding on my return from my morning walk. As I descended the steps of the piazza, I saw some of the servants rolling a barrel into the yard. They rolled it to the piazza and left it. "What is this you are making?"I asked of my uncle, as he returned from a short stroll with his little pet, Miss Molly. "What is it? why, a cistern, to be sure." "A cistern?"I replied, a little incredulously. "Yes, a cistern; and why not?" "Why, it is all right, I've no doubt; but I confess I wonder at your having a cistern built when you have the sound at your, door, and the best of springs within fifty-yards." "Well, that is all true enough, Gregory," said my uncle, somewhat testily; "but Professor Matters tells me that this water can't be healthy here' in this. low country.

He had lost his wife before removing from Virginia, and when he settled at Cypress Shore, his maiden sister, Cornelia Smallwood, his housekeeper, Mistress Polly Feggins, and his son, Robert Smallwood, were his whole family. It is necessary, also, to add that the colonel and my father, Mr. John Seaworthy, had married sisters. The latter was lost, in my boyhood, on the Florida Reefs; and I had imbibed his liking for the sea so far as to have I made five voyages, and during which I rose to the berth of mate of one of the finest merchantmen in New York. I remembered Kate as a plump, romping, spirited, hoydenish girl, of dark brown hair, and hazel eyes, whose mischievous twinkle betrayed her through a world of demureness. Molly was of much fairer complexion; of a frailer and more delicate organization; sensitive, affectionate, apt; one of the spirits that cling to your best sympa. thies, you know not why; mercurial, imaginative, spi- ritual, not of the earth earthly. The conversation turned upon the subject of Bob's letter. "Does the colonel know of this whim about going to California?'

The merry, fun- flashing eye was unchanged; the loud, clear, hearty, ringing tones of his good-humored voice; the dress, even to the tie of an unexceptionable cravat, were un-changed. "Where is Madam Jeffreys to-day?" asked 'Mrs. Buckthorn. '"In Edenton, madam," said the doctor with a low bow. "We expected her last evening; but Balaam tells me that she has decided to remain there until Satur- day.' She has a very great horror, you .know, of the ferry, and I fancy that she thought the sound a trifle too rough last evening.. Dinner was announced, and I somehow happened to be seated beside my fair friend Helen Jeffreys. I know not how to describe her; in what words to give the reader an idea of a somewhat slight but admirable f6rm; a full, eloquent eye; a graceful step; a soft, low voice, that makes my heart throb the faster as I write of it; and a smile which won its way through all the yet disco- vered strong points of old bachelor entrenchments.

"I am surprised to hear you say so. What reason can you assign?"'  "Reason? reason enough, colonel. The North keeps. up her aggressions year after year, and things are getting. worse and worse.

"Exactly so, ma'am!"  exclaimed the professor; I "you've- jest hit the; nail right on the head.

The Union, gen- tlemen," said the professor, warming a little, over a glass of scuppernong, 'is jest for all the world like my hy- draulic cement. It ain't so very hard to mix it, and put it well together; but when it's once hardened and then broken, it ain't worth puttin' together."  At this stage of the discussion, we rose from the table, and the gentlemen went to the piazza with pipes and cigars. I lost much, I confess, of the professor's eloquence and Uncle Baldy's ultraism, in a low chat with my fair neighbor; and if this report-of the conver- sation should ever meet the eye of either of them, I hope they will make all charitable allowance for its imperfec- tions, There was another chat in the piazza. The conversation turned upon the agricultural peculiarities of the North and the South.  I "I think we've rayther got the advantage on ye," re- marked the professor. "How?"I "Wal, for one thing, we hev better tools, and all that sort o' thing, We hev a power of hydraulic cistu'ns.

Besides, your farms are so thunderin' big. You can't half cultivate 'em. Manurin' five or six thousan' acres o' land is out of the question. 'Tain't no use talkin'."  "No doubt of it," replied the squire. , What other points have you noted?" "Wal, tew say the truth, I hain't ben here long enough tew decide; but I'll give ye an idee or tew afore I leave." "I understand you have a new invention for us, Pro. fessor Matters?" said Buckthorn. "Pray give-me some account of it."  "' Wal, sir, I can't give ye much account on't ;for the system I foller is a secret. I may say this much though; and p'raps I may give a lectur' sotre o' these days on the subject-mebee to Edentown.

Will the reader think it an intru- sion upon the more important matters of this histoiy, if I say that I rode home with Dr. Jeflreys and his daughter?   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.        109 "Where did you meet with the live specimen?" asked the doctor, as we rode towards Underwood. I gave him, accordingly, the history of Professor Fun- nyford Matters; not omitting an account of the dinner on board:the Pennsylvania, and our memorable voyage. And long and loud did the merry doctor laugh over the narration. A brisk drive of a mile brought us to the doctor's residence. The light of an open fire (bless the inventor of open fires and open doors, after the fashion of the Ancieht Dominion!) shone charily through the windows as we approached the house, The doctor was called away soon after his arrival to attend a patient; and, with ah injunction to Helen to-take me in charge until his return, he left us-alone.

The fire blazed cheerfully on the hearth; the cat purred quietly on the rug, in affectionate proximity to Birdd, the -doc- tor's favorite pointer; the tall old-fashioned clock ticked in age becoming gravity, and held up its long hands in warning to me, as I gazed on the mass of rich brown curls that fell over snowy shoulders, and the outline of the face which they half veiled from me.

I remember a sensation which, as nearly as I can imagine it, was very strikingly similar to the feeling that people are said to experience on the verge of a precipice, an irresistible desire, videlicit, to throw themselves head- long! Time and again did I strive to utter the words that struggled to my lips; and I was about to make a last, and stronger, and more desperate effort, when Dr., Jeffreys returned. Dear, dear Helen Jeffreys! H Bless me, what a confession I was going to make! "By the by," said the doctor, after chatting :awhile, "I have a teacher for my little folk. The colonel and Squire Butterton are to send theirs, and' we shall have a merry set of them. He is away just now." "From the north?"  "'Yes; but not at all Yankeeish or. provincial ; tra- veled, I fancy." "And an author, too," said Helen. "Indeed." - "Yes,'" interposed the doctor; "and Helen has coaxed him into a permission for us to read the MS." "'Better than that, Mr. Seaworthy; I have- read a part of it to him. You'll like Mr. Haynes, I am sure." "I am quite sure I shall not," thought I; and omit- ting, with the reader's permission, to state the precise locality to which I felt some inclination to send Ir.

MY AUNT CORNY.-CLIMATE.--A CHLL.    "Macies, et nova febrium Terris incubuit cohors.". MY Aunt Corny was one of my greatest favorites. She was, not to speak too definitely on such a subject, a middle-aged lady, of small stature. Her complexion was dark; her eyes and hair black as night. She was thin, quite so; and she was most literally of that degree of fragility which the winds of heaven may not visit too roughly. She increased her diminutive stature some- what by wearing her hair through all the variations of the mode, in projecting puffs, which flanked a central pyramid, supported by a venerable comb, whose dimen- sions would frightenmany a modern belle. She wore black almost uniformly; and on some occasions sported a cap, which, as not one of the initiated, I cannot be ex- pected to describe.- She was never out of humor; that is to say, seriously so. True, she would sometimes be- tray a shade of displeasure at some negligence of a servant, or the fussiness of the, over-particular MiStress Polly Feggins, the housekeeper; but, beyond this, her life having passed its April and summer, resembled those weeks of uninterrupted sunshine which sometimes mark the early fall. She was refined and lady-like in all she   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.        113 did. She had an ear for the faintest sigh, and a heart open as the day to every generous and charitable sympathy. She was, however, a timid, shrinking s'ortof Woman, and of that highly excitable temperament called nervous. She was, too, something of'an invalid. She had a truly apos- tolic faith in the cold-bath, shower-bath, flannel, and flesh-brushes,; and these articles of faith not only fretted her into indisposition; but, I am sorry to add, sometimes became topics of conversation, which were anything but edifying to her auditors. She had, too, much the same sort of faith in early rising; and she thu's not unfre- quently robbed herself of needful rest. For this she religiously atoned by a longer nap after dinner. She was a famous doctress, -too. Every planter has his medicine chest, and he becomes, as do the members of his family, sufficiently familiar with the ordinary diseases of the climate to prescribe very safely in many cases which; in town, would receive the attention of a regular physician. This will explain the fact that my Aunt Corny knew, to a grain, the necessary dose of blue mass or quinine for the ordinary intermittent fever, as wellas the milder remedies, But her chief forte was in spring medicines, as she called them. It was her custom every summer to gather her stock of herbs; chamomile, catnip, thoroughwort, red pepper, pennyroyal-what not? These were carefully dried and preserved for use. Then she knew so many varieties 6f bitters, each an unfailing specific and she had a way of commending her medi- cines by faking them herself. She was fully persuaded that the colonel'was fast going to his grave because he would not take .her doses;- while he, jolly old soul! laughed remorselessly at her until he saw the tears start- 10*  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC8061-00000056"/> "4         BER T IE: ing, and then he would kiss her, take a spoonful of bitters  with the very- wryest of faces, and restore her to good humor. There was one closet filled with her medical  preparations and. appliances; and to this, at the first  visible symptom of illness, did she fly. Did the colonel growl with the rheumatism, she was loud in the praise of spirits of turpentine, hot vinegar, iodine, and British l oil. Did he groan with-his' periodical colic, forth from the miniature dispensatory came ether, laudanum, and peppermint, while Grief was dispatched with a cup of spice and brandy to be heated for instant administration. Did Molly cough, there was no end. to the forthcoming syrups. Had Polly Feggins a sick headache, you would have thought the sick room a hospital; so numerous were the infallible remedies. This, to say the truth, was rather annoying to the colonel; for she would keep ra servant a week in the hospital, when he. might as well have been relieved in twenty-four hours. "Don't dose the sick ones to death, sister Corny," he would say. "Give them one medicine at a time." "Why, brother John; how can you: say so, and the  poor creatures suffering so?" "Well, well, Corny, have your own way. The ladies always do!" and the colonel would beat a retreat. Blind Alice, the greyhound, staggered up to me uncon- scious of the ungentle reception which I had givenold Pon- to, with a mute but expressive and affectionate welcome. I bent over her and caressed her, in'a somewhat peniten- tial mood; and old Ponto, generous old fellow, sidled"up and was also patted. That he did not die'of surfeit that week is more fairly attributable to his own ostrich-like   A HUMOROtJS NOVEL.       115 digestive powers than to any deficiency in the quantity of food with which I stuffed him, by way of expiatory sacrifice, as fruits meet for repentance. I was always gentle, by the by, to domestic animals. Not that I lacked, in my boyhood, the universal propensity to test and exercise my power over them; but I was so taught by my father-peace to his ashes! As I grew older, I had some cause to suspect that my 6rgan of benevolence, phrenologically speaking, was soniewhat too largely Ieveloped; for, not to mention dogs and cats apoplec- ically departed this life, I so stuffed a favorite black iorse with oats and corn meal that he very unexpectedly went to the bourne so fatal to all travelers; "Nox, fabule que Manes, Et domus exilis Plutonia." F To this day, possibly for the same reason, it is the rarest hing in the world for me to hunt or fish. But, pardon ae; I am not writing' an. autobiography. On entering the house, I saw Grief going up stairs with a bowl of tea. "Grief,' said I. "Sah." "Who is sick?"  "Massa 'Fesah."  "You mean Professor M tters." "Ya-a-s, maussa.' " "What ails him?" "Do' know, massa. He done gin out dis mawnin'. Miss Corny ben give him fo' dose physic. Got a mighty bad aguy, I b'lieve."

What in natur makes the weather so cold all to once?" "You have a chill." "A what?" "A chill." "What on airth du yaou mean by a chill?"

"Yaou don't mean to say't I've got the bilious?" "Perhaps not," I replied, a little maliciously, seeing the professor's alarm. "Don't deceive me.

"Don't look so dolefully, professor; you won't die this time. You have merely got a chill. I'll have you up to-morrow." "Dew yaou really think so, doctor?" "Of course I do. When were you taken?"

Then, during the day, take quinine once in two-hours. If you can't sleep to-night, take one of these every half hour." And the doctor handed him a box. What's all this?" "Some of Aunt Corny's preparations." Well, pitch the stuff out of the window, if you hope to survive till morning. I've another call to make.

And the doctor vanished.  The chill passed away; and, after a violent fever, during which the terror of the professor was most ludi. crous, the medicine was taken. In the evening, the doctor called again, in company with the squire and Uncle Baldy. The- colonel also came, and. sat for an hour in the sick-room; and we succeeded in restoring the patient to something like his usual flow of spirits. When they had gone, I administered the prescribed opiate, and the professor was soon asleep. The next day he was decidedly better. In the eve- ning he dressed, and made his appearance in the draw- ing-room. I'll be darned ef I didn't think I was goin' to kick the-bucket," he said, as he finished giving an account of his sensations to Aunt Corny. She, good soul, was a ready listener; and expressed her wonder that any one in the world should be without nutmeg and red pepper, evidently ascribing the professor's recovery to the inun- dation of doses she had sent him the day before. There was crockery enough at that moment in the professor's chamber to "set up" a small family a housekeeping. "This is a queer climate, anyhow," said the professor, musingly. ," I used tew wonder what in natur made people 'bout here, some on 'ema least-ways, look so yal- ler ahd onhealthy, an' walk so faint-away-like.

I was about to enter the parlor and sing with her (sl always insisted that I was a "great help to her in second"), when she struck a symphony entirely ne to mne. I paused.

"(here she said something that sounded like e  Gay, or Gray, or Hayes), "let me, make you acquainted in I with my nephew, Mr. Gregory Seaw6rthy." I bowed, and accepted the hand of the, stranger; all the more cordially, I confess, for his performance at the  piano. I could see but little to impress me in the hasty glance which I gave him in the ceremony of the intro- duction, save that he was a small, pale, slightly formed young man of an almost unnatural brilliancy of eye. There was nothing fierce or unpleasant in its lustre. To the contrary, although he did not smile, the. look was full of kindness. But the most striking characteristic, and the one by which I best remember him, was an ex- pression of calmness, thought, power of mind, and great- ness of heart. We resumed our singing,.and ran over the greater part of my aunt's collection of songs ;the most of which,: I undertake to- say, did not date farther back than the fifteenth century. My uncle had rode out into some of the fields, and Professor Matters-was busily at work upon the. cistern. Little Molly was ailing, and, my aunt informed me, had kept her room during the whole morning, I proposed, therefore, to my new acquaintance, whose name I had  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8061-00000061"/> 124         BERTIE:            not yet learned, to walk with me. ) My favorite walk, as I have already said, was on the shore of the Albemarle; and thither webent our steps.  "That is a glorious sight to me,' said the stranger, pointing to the sound. "I wonder how many there are who feel like myself, that this world of ours is full of beauty, in its lowliest and homeliest range of visible forms?"         hoei "They are few, I fear, very few." "And such is precisely myfear. May not this be the compensation to the scholar for the trammels of the po. sition which society has allotted him?"    , , "But iss society at fault in the matter?' Are you among those who demand a reform or. a reorganization of it?" ' With some qualification, yes. Is it not an enigma?

Keen, careful, considerate; prudent above the degrees of economy, thrift, guardianship, or housewifery; 'yet eve;ry day the victim-yes, the mother and perpetrator of humbug."

"Why, I had simply thought of it, as indeed many southern gentlem-en of the highest respectability think, as an evil, a very great evil.

But the other side of the picture, if not studiously concealed from the masses at the north, has never to, my knowledge been fairly laid before them..

"Why, sir,"' he replied, " it has not been very flatter- ing. A lady friend of mine carried this" (pointing to a IMS, volume) "to New York some weeks since, and offered it to several of the leading publishers.

"Will you not, then, publish at all?," I Perhaps I may, - I am unwilling to think there are no publishers who are disposed to encourage our own authors. I am not, however, very sanguine.

ON the following morning, being Saturday, the pro- fessor reminded me at an early hour of my promise to accompany him to-the post-office. The reader who has ever sojourned in a region of weekly or semi-weekly mails will readily understand the excitement of the mail-days at Cypress Shore. The colonel was looking for The Intelligencer, my Aunt Corny for a magazine, or a letter from Bob or Kate Smallwood. Molly herself was beginning to look forward to mail-day as the cer- tain source of pleasure. The professor declined riding on horseback, and the carriage was ordered. Meanwhile, Broomstraw was or- dered for my especial benefit; not only because I pre- ferred the saddle, but because. I had known such an accident as meeting a certain fair lady whose eques- trian excursions I was nothing loth to share. Leaving my uncle and the professor to jog on by themselves, I remained lawhile with my Aunt Corny, to -practice what she was pleased to call "' a new piece of music ;" none other dow be it spoken) than "The Carrier Dove." I have not yet mentioned to the reader, and I aam yet, re- luctant to say, that my excellent aunt had at the age of &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC8061-00000065"/> 132         BERTIE: seventeen a lover who belonged to the dragoons. He was perfection by her account; and was in fact as noble a fellow as ever bestrode a charger. Something wild, to be sure; 'but then that might be overlooked in a dra. goon. His memory was the green spot in the'pastto my aunt; and she never sung one of her sentimental songs without saying, "Ah! if you could have heard poor Henry's second to that!" My uncle's rickety old piano (it had not been-tuned since the war of 1812) gave forth a jingling accompani. ment, with many a startling note of complaint-; but the song was finished at last, and my Aunt Corny took my hand in hers as she said," How much that reminds me of poor Henry!" I pressed her thin fingers in mine, with my best effort to look sympathetic, and hurried away. Much to my regret, I saw nothing of the doctor or of Helen; and my ride to the post-office was-somewhat dull and lonely. I never knew Broomstraw to be so snail-paced before, and I passed the- beautiful wood-roads in the groves be- tween Cypress Shore and the post-office with never a look at them. When I dismounted at the store, there were a score of country gentlemen lounging about it, await- ing the arrival of the mail. There were, too, some half a dozen boys, with little letter-bags, who were quite as eagerly looking in the direction in which the mail- carrier usually approached the office. The professor was in the midst of a group of persons, to whom he was explaining the merits of his new system of hydrology. Such, at any rate, I supposed to be the case, for I heard him say, as I was shaking hands with Uncle Baldy Buck- thorn, "No doubt on't, gentlemen.

That is the reason why I so hate this dull,-lifeless, soulless, nerveless monotony of country life. But for my pen and the duties of the school-room I could not live. You call the northerners cold, passionless, unimpressible; but I have yet to find blood in Carolina that so courses in its channels as mine. I have even had some thoughts of a trip to the gold mines, that I might thus be tolerably certain of a year or two of activity. Had I the physi- cal development for the purpose, I would enlist in the dragoons. Enough, however. And now to my story. Mr. Lewis Bugby (I am ready to make affirmation that nobody has ever before called him anything but Lewis) was my opposite in almost every trait of character. If he bwere in the China Sea, that is to say, as far opposite to me as he could well be, I undertake to say that he would climb  What's the highest mast of a ship?" "The mainskysail-mast, usually."

A hotel at which we were staying (he occupied a room oppositeto mine) caught fire. - I awoke him, with much difficulty, however, for he was opposed to waking at all. He did not leave his chamber until he had adjusted his cravat and breastpin, and re-laced his waistcoat. I am of opinion that a decided act of volition would have cost him his life. He was accus- tomed to say that he meant to 'take the world easy,' and   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.        147 there is not a shadow of a doubt, to my thinking, that he was sincere. Then, he was obstinate. Swine and mules have acquired a sort of family notoriety for being somewhat tenacious and unyielding, but, trust me, they are models of soft compliance when compared with my friend and chum, Mr. Lewis Bughy. But I weary you, and, after all, I have given you no-adequate idea of the unexcitable individual in question. "It-so happened that- he had two sisters, as unlike him- as black is unlike white. That is to-say, they were charming girls, the one sixteen, the other fighteen years of age. Miss Lossy (such was the family diminutive for Eliza) was an especial favorite of mine. I went holme with Lewis, in the first term of my junior'year, to spend a fortnight of our vacation. The ladies were absent-on a visit, It was expected, however, that they would be at the house of Mr. Furness, a friend of Mr. Bughy, senior, the next day, Saturday. Mrs. Bughy said that they would accompany Mr. Furness to a neighboring church. It was agreed, therefore, that we should visit Mr. Smith, a bachelor friend of Mr. Bughy, junior, and go thence, on Sabbath morning, to church. By this arrangement we should have the pleasure of a night with the hospitable and intelligent Mr. Smith, and meet the ladies at church. "We arrived at Mr. Smith's residence just at night- fall, and were as well entertained as could be expected in a bachelor establishment.

' I remember thinking, as I grew drowsy, of the next mornings ride at the expense of my friend Bughy's buggy and bays, of handing the ladies from the carriage to the church-door, of a ride home with them after ser- vice, and a delightful evening with them and the family of Mr. Furness. I was debating what I might venture to say to Miss Lossy, resolving myself into a committee of the whole on the state of our union, when Old Somnus moved the previous question, and I was asleep. I dreamed of Lossy Bughy (Phoebus! what a name! but then I could change it!) I had, in my dream, walked with the fair one to the shades of a beautiful grove. A storm gathered. The sky grew dark as night, the light- ning flashed, the wind howled through the pines, the thunder rolled fitfully through the heavens. We were beneath a huge oak. Miss Bughy-so it appeared to me in my dream-shrunk timidly, yet trustfully, towards me (your confiding girls always carry a bachelor's heart by storm); my arm somehow encircled her waist, and I was just murmuringthe low, husky words of a 'first passionate love,' when rethought I was struck by light- ning and hurled to the ground.

I took no pains to conceal my uneasiness, in the hope that he would change his purpose and go to, church. I fussed, walked, hinted, sighed-what not? But my chum philosophically ignored my misery. He read the last number of the county newspaper, adver- tisements and all, smoked, yawned, and finally retired for a nap. I seized my hat, went to the woods, and there groaned and stamped in sheer vexation: - "I went back to the house. Both my friends were asleep. I read the papers. I pored for two hours over Frost's Picture History of the War with Mexico. A black baby squalled up and down the chromatic scale.

It had, nevertheless, instead, of the crumbling dilapidated air of age, rather the labored erectness and vigor of a veteran soldier or sailor, to whom erectness and vigor have become matters of habit.

Underneath it was a very motley gathering of carriages, farming utensils-what not? Old hats, that might very readily suggest the idea (the quaintness of the conceit I believe to be of modern origin) that there had been bricks in them; old shoes so old as to make it not at all improbable that they had been, centuries agone, on a pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre. Then there were axes, rakes, hoes, harrows, ploughs, a sulky and a carriage, wearing "an in- teresting look of better days."' On divers pins, mistily peering forth from nebulous .cobwebs, hung here an old side-saddle, which was old in my Aunt Corny's teens, and there a dilapidated harness, long past the possibility /of any benefitof extreme unction. There, too, was old Peter Law's cart, its head meekly downcast, the shafts resting upon the ground. Its wheels were most plentifully coated with dry mud. It stood in a sort of resigned quiet and repose, as if it had outlived the gayeties of its younger days, and wearing a cadaverous look betokening decay, either from age or rough usage-perhaps from both; buttmy opinion leans towards the chronic character of the affection. At any rate, when old Peter Law roused it that morning from its slumbers, and harnessed Jim, a whitey-brown, time-defying old mule (Peter as- sured me that he " could kick like a four-year-old"), I had serious'fears for the consequences of so abrupt a break- ing in upon its repose. Jim was soon inside its well- polished shafts, and started at the first cluck of his dusky driver. The cart tottered reluctantly forth with the un-   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.   153   steady gait of a man who has deliberately made up his mind that he  "  - won't go home till morning," sending forth to the startled ear of the day a sharp, shrill, complaining shriek, betraying, as I thought, some organic ailment of long standing. Its axle was thrust ungrace- fully through the hubs, for all the world like the thin legs of an ague-stricken urchin through breeches long out-grown. As I passed the shed, I heard the voice of Professor Matters. He was conversing, it soon appeared, with my friend Buckthorn's overseer, who had come to the plantation on some errand or other to me unknown. As their conversation was not in the low tone of confi- dence, I was not guilty, as it appears to me, of any very flagrant breach of politeness in listening to it.

He soon fol- lowed, and when breakfast was announced, was romping with Molly in the piazza. It was not seven o'clock when we rose from the table and took our departure. "Yaou don't 'pear to like the northerners much, du yaou, colonel?" said the professor, as we rode away. "Like them?  Most certainly I do. I admire their energy, economy, and' pers'everence.

About two weeks ago another clock-peddler came along with a kind of clocks-which he said were much better. He offered them for eight dollars, and said he would take the old one at two dol- lars in part pay. My friend Buckthorn had occasion to go to Windsor the next day, and lo! he finds his old clock thrown away in the bushes by the roadside.

We were among- the earliest to arrive. The hotel was thronged with waiters who -were in readiness to re- ceive-the guests. I found mine host and his-lady, both of whom at once recognized-me, bustling asthmatically about in the work of preparation. Mr. Dawson was filling the sugar-drawers with lump-sugar, while Mrs. Dawson was as nearly ubiquitaus and out of breath as it Was possible for her to be. She assured me that she was 'Ajust ready to drap." She-had been, she said, as busy as a bee for the last three days in making prepara- tions. A glimpse of the pantry where meats, pies, pud. dings, cakes--what not?-were piled like shot' in an ordnance-yard, fully confirmed the statement. "Had I ever been at Court in the country?"' she asked. -No,' "Well, then, I should see sights!" she exclaimed; and she waddled away with a sigh of exhaustion. Anon came the people in carts, in carriages, on horse. back, on foot. I saw the professor in anagony of laugh- ter as he watched the advent of two men in a cart which was. drawn by a single steer. Such. horses; thin as the Cumaean Sybil, who could only be recognized by her voice; consumptive, asthmatic, shadowy, dilapidated, uncombed, unwashed, unfed; despair in their long, sharp faces. "The carts were in similar variety. The yard, however, was fast filling up with horses and carriages that would do credit- to any part of the country. Among the arrivals was that of " a show," as it was called; the same being a deformed dwarf, whose picture roughly   sketched on canvas was quite enough to disgust me. It proved, however, to be one of the lions of the day. In one corner of the public room was a book-peddler, demure, spectacled, sanctified-looking. -'In another cor- ner a saddler exposed his goods, and in another : shoe- maker was similarly employed; Not far from the door of the court-house was a 'covered cart laden with oys- ters.

Fips, ninepences and quarters were thrown' recklessly, almost furiously down, with the desperate air of people who are resolved to have what is technically called " a bender." The professor seetned perfectly at hoihe. Whenever and wherever I met him, hee was exhibitinga piece of hardened cement. Not far from the oyster cart was a sort oftent, if such it could be called, it being simply a- sheet fastened at each corner to a pole, and thus serving to shelter from the rays of the sun an'ample stock of cakes a-ad candy and nuts.

It was rWarm that day., The landlady meekly and in resignation rolled her eyes heavenward; while mine host, "as subject'to heat as-butter," seemed ready to evapo- rate.

' At dinner-time,'acrowd was gathered at the door of the dining-room.. When at length it was unfastened, there was a general-rush, on the-tide of which mine host   I   159   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.   was bornelong, to the irremediable detriment of a new and somewhat"iight pair of'Sunday breeches. The table was loaded. There 'was beef. by the half-ox, whole hecatombs of fowls, vegetables innumerable. After dinner came the speeches from some of the political can- didates, and-at theinstigation of Dr. Jeffreys, Professor Matters was called upon for a speech upon his new sys- tern of hydrology. The substaince thereof may, per- chance, yet be given to the world. At three o'clock in the afternoon the crowd began to disperse, and we were among the first to depart. -The professor informed us that he had been very successful, having closed a bargain for no less than five cisterns. "-And to construct them you' will require several weeks," observed my uncle. "Ya-a-s.- An' what's better than that, colonel, I shall hev all I can dew for a year, mebby tew years. Yaou Grief!" "Sahk!"     "What time 'll we git hum?" "'Bout a hour by sun, maussa." - "-You are not going to leave us, professor?"I asked. "No; but ef we're going tew muster to-morrer, I've got some letters to write and some other dockyments to fix.'?' - "Drive on, Grief," said my uncle. "So you are likely to be with us through the summer, Professor Matters?"' " "Wal, I don't know 'xactly.

"You need run no risk of having a fever at all." "She! Haow du yaou mean?" - "Give us the pleasure of your company at Nag's Head."  "Where's that?"  "A summer resort on the sea-shore. We shall go about the tenth of July. You need be at no expense if you will accept of such fare as we can give you, and you will meet many of our wealthiest planters, who will very likely give you an opportunity to make your system of hydrology very extensively known. What say you?" "Say? Why, I'll dew it, sure's the 'Postles!" "It is so understood, then. I think you will find Nag's Head a pleasant place to pass the dog-days. Hurry on, Grief!'" "Ya-a-s, maussa. De grays ben gwan home now, for sure." And Grief performed his most artistic flourish with the whip, urging the petted horses into something very like a brisk trot. It was not yet sunset when we approached the outer gate at Cypress Shore. Little Molly, accompanied by her maid Linda, had come out to meet us. She was very speedily nestling in the folds of my uncle's cloak- theevenings were still chilly--and was rewarded by a doting hug, which she seemed to relish with infinite satis- faction. We weresoon at the door. Aunt Corny bustled about with her usual activity. She commissioned Polly Feggins to, see to the buildingof fires in the chambers,   A HUMtOROUS NOVEL,       161 and 'hurried: Hetty, the cook,- in her preparations for supper. -              ,' "Do look at the sound!" she exclaimed. -And she led the way to the piazza. It was indeed a beautiful sight. There was not a ripple on its broad surface. r To the right were the mouths of the Roanoke and the Cashie. They were barely discernible among the low cypresses that lined the shore. The light boat lay mo- tionless at her moorings, while the notes of a song came from her deck across the water. The little steamer Fox was gliding past; and here and there were schooners becalmed. The rays of the setting sun- fell upon their white sails, giving them the appearance of being much nearer to us than they really were. On the lawri were half a score of calves. and the colonel's merinoes; and these were soon set scampering by the frolicsome gallop of the horses just let loose from fhe carriage. "Hello!" exclaimed the professor, suddenly, there's a sail-boat!" "Where?" asked my Aunt Corny. "There by that p'int. Tew, by the great horn'spune!

She's stand- ingup, waving her bonnet-My God! she's overboard!" My uncle and the professor started with me for the shore. Molly and my' Aunt Coray shrieked, and fol; lowed us. ,- -"There's a feller jumped arter her!" exclaimed the professor. "Hold on! hold on!" shouted he, as if he thought his voice might reach them. "Human natur! I b'lieve they're both on 'em drowned. No they ain't! There they come tu the top o' the water! Hold on! Hold- on! Strike aout! Yaou're. a trump anyhow! Safe? Safe! by' the peowers!- O, Childern of Isril! haow my heart beats!" The lady was indeed safe. She was lifted into the boat just as we reached the shore of the sound. When my Aunt Corny with Molly, the housekeeper, and half a dozen servants came up, the boatmen had shipped their oars, and were pulling with might and main direct- ly towards us. On they came. The water foamed be- neath the bows, and in a few minutes the light, beauti- ful boat grated upon the sand. "My dearest uncle! My Aunt Corny! Molly, you rogue!" were some of the exclamations as Kate Small- wood sprang upon the beach, dripping wet and shiver- ing-with cold. Bob Smallwood followed in like predica- ment. My uncle had recourse to his bandanna, and looked very-intently towards the mouth of the Roanoke; for what particular purpose he never informed me. My Aunt Corny sobbed hysterically, and sunk down, upon the sand" . "Come! come!" said my uncle, gruffly; " we must get' to the house.. Sister Corny, don't, be silly!

IT  "  ,    -      i There now!" exclaimed Kate, interrupting the. an- gry Bob; "not another word, or I turn about and go back." "WelWell ell'! let it go, then. We have you safe and sound."  A brisk walk brought us very speedily to the house. The wet garments were soon exchanged for dry ones; the fires blazed, "broad and bright and high," and a bowl of my Aunt Corny's best hot egg-nogg honored the arrival. Professor Matters was duly made acquainted with the newcomers. In the evening, Dr. Jeffreys, his lady and daughter, with the Buckthorns, paidus a visit. A substantial supper smoked upon the board. The egg- nogg and a delicious dish of coffee accomplished their mission, and after supper Grief was ordered toebring his violin. A set was formed; and then to the notes of the Republican Reel did we have a right merry dance of the old school. No lazy lifeless dragging of listless feet through a moping figure; but a real, springing, pulse- stirring, heart-cheering jig. Madam Buckthorn led out the reluctant professor. To him dancing seemed a busi- ness, not an amusement. Never yet have I seen heels so lifted, arms so swung, pigeon-wings so cut-in pieces. The skirts of his long, blue, swallow-tail coat were in sympathetic agitation. Madam Buckthorn whispered his name to Kate, and in peals of laughter the, dance 'was end'ed.

Habi- tually rising at daybreak, I do not remember his sleeping later than myself. I noticed that Grief had accommo- dated -his hatits to those of the professor, and that he invariably blacked his boots and supplied him' with water at night; whereas, for everybody else, he performed those offces in the morning. - Whenr I rose on the fol- lowing morning, Wednesdayi  I raised my wiridow to enjoy the fresh air, and proceeded to'dress.

"Long life tew ye! haou du yaou-du '?" "  I'm quite well; I'm 'bliged to ye, Professor Matters; how doodo yo " do?    .   -       , "W al, tol'ble. Goin' few muster?

"We 'call it sparkin' to Steventown, I think I'll go.' "So do. You'll find the Widder some, now I tell you.  And the overseer (our neighbor Buckthorn's) departed. On going to the piazza, I met the professor'as he was ascending the steps. ".Good mornin', Mr. Seaworthy," said he. "Good morning; Professor Matters. I hope you'are very well this morning."

Mr. and Mrs. Buclthorn, as well as the laughter-loving lieutenant, Mr. Henry Buck. thorn, quizzed theprofessor unmercifully (in which they were aided by Dr. and Madam Jeffreys) about the widow, and we rose from the table in a war of laughter occa. sioned by little Molly; who asked, very demurely (I suspected Madam Buckthorn's agency in the matter), "if Uncle Fatty was going to see Mithith Bloththum?" It was at-least nine o'clock before the professor and myself left-Cypress-Shore for the residence of Mistress Blossom. It may as well be said here, confidentially to the reader, that that lady, although she had many warm friends- and admirers, had not altogether escaped the suspicion of having some native acerbity, in spite of a very agreeable and almost perpetual smile. In one re- spect, too, she was likely to suit the professor, for she was remarkably fond of dogs, a 'huge cur, very appro- priately named Growler, occupyingithe post of prime favorite. For the professor, he now habitually took with him the large dog which had been given him some days before. Indeed, he was with us on the present occasion. An easy drive of something like two hours and a half brought us to Windsor. The military were already in full feather on parade. There may have been some fif. teen mounted, and possibly fifty in the ranks of the infantry. I have, before and since that day, seen nany military companies and evolutions, but assuredly there was, never anything to match those which met my astonished' gaze on that memorable morning.

I have not the least doubt that, in the enthusiasm of the hour, that company would have  volunteered as a forlorn hope to take Gibraltar by storm. "Wal," exclaimed the professor, as we rode out of town, "I thought I had seen all the varieties of the hew- man specie! -I've traveled some in my day.

There were two horses standing, saddled, at the .rack; from which I -inferred that the dashing wido,1 might already have visitors on the same errand as that of the professor. A smiling negro met us as we alighted, and we entered the house. I observed that the professor took his venerable overcoat with him, and suggested to' him 'that the servant would see it properly taken care of., He declined trusting it out of his sight, however, and actually carried it into the hall. The servant who met, us at the door ushered us into the drawing-room, where, as I had expected, there were two middle aged gentlemen awaiting the advent of I the widow. She was not long in making her appearance. My reception was most cordial. Question after question did Madam Blossom ask me concerning all the world at Cypress Shore; throwing, now and then, an inquiring and somewhat puzzled glance. at the professor, who sat with his fingers demurely interlocked, looking vacantly at the fender. In due time, however, he was drawn into conversation by the two gentleme'n, of whom I have spoken. They left us an'hour before dinner time; evi- dently not a little amused with the professor'; and the field was thus left clear.  A little mellow'"old peach," just'before dinner, thaw- ed the professor's reserve, or timidity, whichever it might be, and he startled me by asking the widow if he could "hev a few minutes confab with her: in t'other room?"  "Certainly, sir," she replied, startled even more'than myself; and-she led the way to the parlor opposite--the room in which we were sitting.

The pro- fessor-looked mysterious and grave, and the widow looked mortified -and confused when they returned to the draw-; ing-room; and it was some time before the former cheer- ful tone of conversation Was restored. Dinner was an. nounced. Our hostess rallied, as did the professor, and I congratulated myself on our recovery fromi the previous somewhat embarrassing restraint. I have already mentioned that. the professor took his -surtout from the carriage, and carried it to the hall. Dan- ger, his dog, had, it would seem,; conceived it to be his duty to stand sentry over it; and the good-humored ser- vant had winked at the intrusion. Now, it so happened that the widow's' dog had returned from somen morning excursion,'not a little fatigued, and, of course, sharp set for his dinner. 'The kitchen odors had risen gratefilly to his nostrils; pnd, getting inpatient, he ventured to take a most unusual liberty; none otherthan to enter the piazza, where, at firsti as I have since been)informed, he did not discover the equally hungry dog of my friend Mat- ters.  I have also mentioned that Mistress Blossom had been blessed with six children; the oldest of which, Imay add, was about ten years of age. We had been at the table, perhaps ten. minutes,when this last -personage, Byron by name, opened the door of the -dining-room, and looked inquiringly in upon us. "Byron,; my dear," said' the widow, " go out now, that's a good boy!"  But Byron appeared to prefer staying. He pushed the door somewhat more widely open;, and I discovered the   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.       173 laxen heads and unpresentable dress of a small squad- on of urchins behind him.

But Byron did not go. Acting as commodore of the squadron, he now made sail into the dining-room; the rest of-the fleet falling into line in his wake. The. pro- fessor looked frowningly at Byron; but that -hero was not to be thus -daunted. There was manifestly a disposition on both sides to-clear ship for action. I made a-diver- sion in the enemy's favor by chaffing with the widow; and had anticipated a quiet adjustment of the difficulty. Great, however, is the uncertainty of human expecta- tions. It wouldt appear that Growler became impatient of delay, and that his appetite got the better of his-dis- cretion; for he advanced into the hall' directly towards the professor's surtout, when, not having the fear of his master before his eyes, Danger rose wrathfully up and joined issue with the widow's favorite. In the heat of the battle, and before they could be separated, they both got under the table; whereupon, in some' spasmodic struggle, they both reared on end, and, in dire crash of crockery and gliding of gravy and mingling of meats, over went the table. The professor caught Growler by the tail, while I took a pitcher of water from the side- table and dashed it into the faces of the belligerents. They were not, however, to be thus parted.  Dire was the wrath that now flushed the face of the excited widow. Seizing the tongs, she advanced to- wards the dogs and opened her batteries.  15*  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC8061-00000086"/> 174         BERTIE: "You.

Down, "with hideous ruin and combustion,' came Mistress- Blossom, amid much rattling of crockery.

"The same difficulty," said the schoolmaster, exists with regard to southern manlufactures. The South has failed, as a general thing, to sustain them.'  "' Yes, even her mechanics,' replied the lieutenant; "but do you know the usual result of encouragement to northern" mechanics who settle-here? Ask any citizen of Bertie.

As a matter of course I accepted it. He did hiniself Credit as a driver, andwe soon left the lieutenant-far in our wake.- Itis scarcely necessary to inform-the reader that, besides the accomnplished Mrs. Jeffreys; there 'was still another occupant of the barouche ; and that I left, the doctor to the uninterrupted care of the whip and the reins.  We were not long in reaching the church. It stood in a grove of noble :oaks. It' was a plain,' wooden structure, without spire, or shutters, or paint. As is usual ata. country chtirch in the So uth- there was a well near by, with the neeessary sweep, and bucket and trough. A fewhad already arrived ; and, scattared here and there amnohg the- trees, were the horses,'hitched to the overhanging blanches, while the .carriages-stood in a motley groulp by. themselves. Handing the ladies. to the church door, :we joined the little group outside, now con- stantly increasing, in, which my uncle, The squire, and Uncle 'Baldy -were in quiet conversation. The, area around the church, from which the underwood had been thoroughly cleared, was-speedily thronged rith a- medley of vehicles, the majority of which were family coaches; while, among them, you night also see lighter carriages, -buggies, sulkies, carts and. wagons. At intervals, amohg the trees, were rude deal-tables supported-by stakes.  And now came a scene of bustle. Horses and car-   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.        181 riages were thronging in:from every direction, almost in- visible in the clouds of dust. Not a few came on foot; and the larger portion of these last were negroes who had walked, probably from five to fifteen miles, to attend the meeting. Servants were hurrying to and fro. Greet- ings were exchanged. My uncle had a feeling of pride in being regularly at his post near one of the doors, where he had a hearty word and cheerful smile for every- body. It was his custom, too, to pay particular attention to the ladies of his acquaintance, especially the widows; concerning whom- he rather liked to be rallied,-thoughhe had not the most distant idea of marrying again. I saw him handing the charming Mrs. Blossom from her car- riage, while the professor, who had also arrived, stood at a little distance, evidently at loss to decide how his own civilities might be received. He advanced somewhat awkwardly and paid his respects, and his reception was most gracious. The smile was unmistakeable; and as the professor returned' from the church-door, he set the ubiquitous white hat more erectly upon his' head, drew forth his bandanna with a grand flourish, and took care to leave one-half thereof, when he returned it to the pocket, hanging conspicuously outside. He then drew himself up, threw back his head, and expanded his broad chest, wearing an air of self-gratulatidn and con- sequential dignity that revealed to, me a shade of his character that I had not before discovered. The church was soon' filled.' Its occupants were chiefly' ladies, a few gentlemen only being seated inside, the greater part sitting or standing- near, the doors, where -temporary seats had been provided.'

The preacher was a tall and somewhat stptitly made personage of about fifty. His dress, if not of homespun, was assuredly well nigh as plain. His collar, unstarched but scrupulously white, rolled negligently wover; exposing a large and well-formed neck. The prevailing expression of his face, which was one of strongly marked features, was. that of simple earnestness and. benevolence. His high, but somewhat narrow, forehead overhung grayish and deep-set eyes. The mouth and chin were indicative of much strength and decision of character, and the whole presence of the man reminded me verystrongly of the personal appearance of. Patrick Henry. The tones ol his voice, as he began reading the well known hymn "Children of the Heavenly King, As we journey let us sing," were singularly full, and rich, and deep; and I could see that at the outset he was (perhaps unconsciously) cre- ating a feeling of seriousness in his little congregation. The air to which the words were sung, though not then familiar to me, was a simple and heart-stirring melody, in which nearly every one joined; and the roof rung with it. Then came. an earnest prayer, and another hymn; and the preacher announced for his subject the Year of 'Jubilee. He began 'by saying that thirtytyears agoi he had stood in the same pulpit. "I had," he continued, "many warm friends here at Lebanon"-(the country churches. have usually some such distinguishing name). "There was old Brother G . , who has gone home to   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.        183 his rest. He is in heaven, my brethren.- He has heard the welcome words, Servant of God, well 'done!'. which you sung at his grave. There was good old Brother H   . He's at home, too; one of the forty- and-four. thousand that sing the song'of Moses and the Lamb. His frail body is dissolved, and the eyes that wept over him 'will see him no more forever.- Forever? Here, on earth, I mean. There was pious Sister B Many of you remember her, though, as I look round, I see only here and there a face I know. Yes, here is her son.. My brother, are you a soldier of the cross? The spirits of the'departed are waiting here to carry home glorious tidings. Come! who'll enlist to-day for the holy war?" Simple as was the exordium, and imperfectly as 1 have described it, it brought the tears to many an eye, The talking was hushed outside the church. The aisles and pulpit steps were soon tenanted, and the listeners gathered around the doors and windows. With the same simplicity of which I have spoken, the preacher then gave a brief account of the Year of Jubilee. He spoke first of the antiquity of the Sabbath; of the necessity of periodical rest; of the duty of observing the Sabbath as a necessity of our animal, moral, and intel- lectual nature, rather than an arbitrary law; of the results of cheerful acquiescence in the requirement. Then he adverted to the seventh year similarly set apart; and, finally, of "the sabbath of years"-the Jubilee. ;He spoke of the proclamation of liberty; of the return- ing of ."every man-unto his possession" and "every  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC8061-00000091"/> B BR I E:  man unto his family ;"'of the abundance of the previous years whereby all necessity for toil was removed; of the redemption of property; of restoration from servi. tude. He drew a simple and most affecting picture of the changes that ensued on the advent of that year; of the delirious excitement of the poor debtor as the day drew near, and of the feelings with which he looked down from some neighboring hill, or over the hedge, upon the familiar features of the old hbomestead. He then pictured to us the nearer approach of the day; of the last few hours; of the expected sentinels, trumpet in hand, awaiting the hour that should usher in the year; and then that shout from all Israel "of thousands as of one," and the trumpet-blast that rung from hill to hill throughout the land! "Sinner!" said he, at length, in a low, pleading, earnest tone, "you are toil-worn, you are bankrupt, you are the slave of sin; you are helpless, hopeless. I pro- claim to you good tidings. The Year of Jubilee is come. Come home! You shall rest! ' You that have sold for naught Your heritage above, Shall have it back unbought;' You shall be free. You shall have hope and joy in the dark valley. You shall live and reign forever. Will no one come?" A low voice now struck the air of "Blow Ye the trumpet, blow, The gladly solemn sound." The eflfect-was startling. Scarcely a voice among the hundreds that was not swelling the mighty chorus.

I am so happy!" and threw herself into: the arms of a lady near her. Another, a beautiful girl, crossed to the side of the church opposite to that on which she ad been seated, knelt before a schoolmate and begged her to go to the altar. In spite of every effort, I felt the tears'streaming from my eyes; and, on looking round, I found that there were few who were not similarly affected. The professor had withstood it all until theyoung girl;of whom I have spoken rose from her. seat and knelt, 'when he buried his face in his hands and sobbed aloud. Ladies went to their acquaintances, parents to children, children to parents, brothers to sisters, and sisters to brothers. The preacher descended to the altar. One by one game-a score of his congregation around him. Amid sobs, and groans, and shrieks; the rich tones of the preacher were heard in prayer. A hymn followed, the benedictiona was pronounced, and the congregation was dismissed. The deal -benches were now removed from the church by the negroes and placed near the table. It is the cus- tom for planters to carry a quantity, of bread, fowls, barbecue (roast shoat), bacon, vegetables, and, very commonly, a dessert; which are placed upon the rude tables, and acquaintances, friends, anid strangers are hospitably invited to dine with them. This affords a delightful opportunity for chat among friends, and for. the gallantry of the' young men (to say nothing of widowers who have ceased to be disconsolate) to the ladies. The professor devoted himself especially to the edification of Mistress Blossom.

While we were at dinner,- the negroes held a meeting in the grove. They had been even more excited than the rest of the congregation. The woods rang with the notes of their hymn. They leaped -shouted, clapped their bands. -They embraced one another. ,I could hear such exclamations as "Glory!" 4I'm going home!" "Will you meet me there?" "O! I'm happy, happy, happy!" A short evening service followed, and we turned homeward. There was a stroll that evening in the gray twilight, and Helen Jeffreys was by my side. My heart throbbed, my limbs trembled, my voice was husky, and I had scarcely the power of utterance. Angry with myself for the weakness, I had just assayed to throw it off and give words to the feelings that had so long lain pent in ny breast, when a servant came running towards us, panting for breath, and exclaimed, "O, Miss Helen! do come to de house! Massa Haynes mighty sick;-b'lieve he gwan to die!" We hurried home. The young scholar was indeed in danger. lHe was bleeding profusely at the mouth. The excitement of the day had been too much for him. He sank rapidly, and. when I left him' at daybreak the next morning he had, sunk into, a gentle sleep, breathing so lightly and feebly. as to make me apprehensive that he would not-survive the day.

Let me not be understood to condemn them. I think them favorable opportunities, :in 'very many instances, for the interchange of sentiments and civilities, and as'an exchange of a private and permis- sive for a public and legitimate bore. - "They's one thingi Mr. Seaweather",-so the profes- sor persisted in calling me, in spite of frequent correc- tions--" that I like in society here to the- south." i What may it be?" "Jest this; every man you meet here is somethin' new tew ye., I never get tired o' watchin' the colonel, and Uncle Baldy, and the squire, and Sayles, because they're all different from one 'nother.

"I'm dewin' nicely, I thank ye, Peter." We bade the old servant good morning, and rode on, "Did yaou hear that?" asked the professor. "-Yes."       . "Wal, now, ef I've asked that feller once, I hev asked -him mor'n fifty times in the last week haow he was; and that 'mighty bad aguy' has been the song every time. The darned old sinner!

In similar conversation the time wore away until we had driven within half a mile of the Cashie, when we were met by a deputation from town. The. professor was received with the most marked respect. While he was exchanging greetings with the other gentlemen, Dr. Jeffreys/ proffered me a small handbill, which ran as follows :-    A HUMOROUS NOVEL..          191- RECEPTION OF PROFESSOR MATTERS! 'ORDER OF ARRANGEMENTS. The Committee of Arrangements request their fellow-citizens to as- semble in front of the court-house, at eleven o'clock A. M., this morning.

Gentlemen on Horseback. Citizens Generally. The procession will leave the court-house' at half-past eleven pre- cisely, to meet the 'expected guest,-, With a gravity worthy a better cause, Uncle Baldy formed the procession. The professor entered the car- riage with mine host of the Windsor Hotel.  The music was furnished by a violin, a squealing clarionet, and a hand-organ; the player on this last instrument having, luckily arrived that day.  The procession was soon formed, and we took up our line of march to the air of "Who'll be king but Charley?"   As we entered the village, the professor (it would seem that public, recep- tions had occurred at Steventown) bowed to the mystified citizens on each side of the street. He was escorted to the hotel,'where a private apartment-had been engaged for the purpose, and by the harmless expedient of oblig- ing him to grasp the same hand twice or three times, he was kept busy in shaking hands for something like two hours. Dinner was,then announced.  After the cloth was removed, Uncle -Baldy rose and said: "Fill your glasses, if you please, gentlemen. I  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC8061-00000095"/> ,102        BE.

"But, gentlemen, we here see a scientific in. dividual, the Columbus, if I may so express myself," (Hurrah!) "of a new discovery; who seems likely to prove an exception to the rule. On this subject, however, it would be indelicate for me to dwell.?" (Go on! go on!) "I propose to you the health of Professor Funnyford Matters." And the table was in a roar as he resumed his seat. The professor rose in considerable embarrassment, and, with a preliminary flourish of his bandanna, spoke as follows - "Feller-citizens: "Unaccustomed as I hev al'ays ben tew  public speakin' (and I've no recollection 'o dewin' anythin' in that line sence I left the Steventown Academy), I scarcely know what tew say on the present 'casion.

A HUMOROUS NOVEL.        193 The professor sat down amid a roar of applause. Speeches, songs, and anecdotes followed; and it was not until near sunset that we left Windsor. "I must confess," said the professor, as we rode homeward, " that I didn't expect this." "You have certainly been honored.'" "That I hev. - wish I could git an account of it to The Steventown Jlurory." "That is easily 'accomplished," said I. "We will have the proceedings published in The Gladiator, and forward a copy.' "Wal, then I consider my fortin' made. Won't they open their eyes to Steventown?' ' They certainly will." Dr. Jeffreys, Uncle Baldy, and the lieutenant now overtook us, and it was agreed that the proceedings should be duly reported and printed. We drove rapidly home. As we were approaching the house, the profes- sor turned to me and said: "Did yaou ever notice the map of this 'ere State?" "Yes. - "Wal,then, yaou've obsarved the sea-coast,I s'pose." "Yes." - "Wal, I undertake tew say that they ain't nothin' like it nowhere. A- big nateral breakwater along the whole'coast, so 'at the smallest vessels can navigate the sounds.

We sat long ove. the table, and the professor recounted the events of the day. When I left the drawing-room he was still giving in prolix detail a description of the dinner at Windsor. f- / ' .

FROM that evening I was almost constantly with the poor scholar. He rallied under the medical attendance of Dr. Jeffreys, and the ceaseless kindness of the house- hold. His favorite servant, Tom, was assigned to his service. The faithful negro was constantly at hand, slept in the sick-room, and never seemed weary of his task.  Ten days passed; yet the improvement was less than we anticipated. A letter had been dispatched to his mother, informing her of his illness. As the doctor was indebted to the invalid, he enclosed the amount to her, adding fifty dollars from his own purse, that she might find no pecuniary difficulty in coming at once to Under- wood. She does not know, to this day, like many an- other sufferer, that she received from Doctor Jeffreys a farthing more than 'was due to-her son. She came, at length, accompanied by her daughters; plain-looking, but well-bred, intelligent, refined young women, the eldest Of whom was not more than twenty. Their  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC8061-00000097"/> BERTIEt: presence seemed to work wonders for the invalid. He grew better, slowly, but steadily; and the pale cheek and careworn expression of the despairing mother began to give place to something like cheerfulness and quiet. Meanwhile; Helen Jeffreys had won the hearts of Laura and Mary Haynes. Lieutenant Btickthorn' became, all at'once, a daily visitor at Underwood; and Mr. Snowden, a young clergyman, recently installed in a neighboring parish, seemed to consider himself called upon to bestow very considerable extra-parochial attention to the younger of the sisters. The invalid soon regained his strength so far as to be able to ride; and we dismissed our appre- hensions for his recovery. .The mother and daughters were detained, on one pretext or other, for several weeks; and when it was found impossible to keep them longer, a little school was made up for them. A vacant cottage, about half a mile from Underwood, was put in repair, and the happy mother, with her son and daughters, was induced to take up her residence there. Little Molly and Sophie and Susan Buckthorn weire at once placed under her care. Servants were ostensibly hired to her, but in reality given; while my Uncle John,:the squire, and Uncle Baldy, as well as the kind-hearted Mr. Sayles, found means in one way or other to make the cottage a snug, comfortable home. It may be taken for granted that the doctor -and the ladies were not remiss in doing their part, and we had at length the pleasure to see the little family prosperous and happy.- Their arrival seemed to give a new zest to the social courtesies of the neigh- borhood.

Meanwhile, the professor had received the expected materials and been constantly employed. It may have been a- week after the invalid had so far- recovered as to take the air in the carriage, that he (the professor) re- turned to Cypress Shore.' He had succeeded beyond his expectations, and having a few days' leisure came to-pay us a visit, "Haow du yaou du?" said he, as- he::ascended the steps of the piazza. ' Glad to see ye.

I did not report myself to the president until yesterday, and so he ignored my presence. I am told that they have a similar custom :on board our men-o'- war. A midshipman, for instance, asks leave to go ashore. On his return, as he reaches the gangway, he touches his cap to the officer of the deck, and when he gets near enough, touches his cap a second time, and says, "I've returned on board, sir.- I suppose it is all right.

"I suppose it must be so," said he, after musing awhile. "It 'were better to stay for the principle of finishing what he has begun. However, if Bob does not deceive me, he will not sit quietly down and leave his books to grow musty." A week had not passed before he came; and after a long consultation, he announced his decision to clear up Bucklersbury and make it his home. Accordingly, with his usual energy, he went at once with forty negroes into the depths of the woods, and while he was clearing the rich soil, a contract was made with a neighboring plan- ter to cut a canal through the low grounds. The work went'bravely on. Meanwhile, the weeks' glided 'away until the colonel began to think of Nag's Head, The schoolmaster had recovered, and was prospering beyond his hopes. His little school had been enlarged, and a publisher in Phila- delphia had undertaken to publish his book. Of the professor, we had heard nothing for three or four weeks; and we only awaited his arrival to go to Nagse HRead, He came at last, but much to our surprise, announced his intention to remain at that place but a single week.

It was nearly sunset of a fine evening about the middle of July that we embarked for our summer retreat. Capt. Gasket had just given his pet, the good schooner Sarah Porter, a new set of sails and a coat of paint, and was manifestly flattered by our. genuine start of surprise at the improvement in her appearance. Dr. Jeffreys had decided to accompany us, as had also Madam Haynes and -her family, and what with furniture, live-stock, and passengers, the little schooner had a motley and some- what cumbersome deck-load. The squire, accompanied by his lady and children, stood on the shore and waved his good-by. A light air from the west struck our sails, and as we passed Gravestone Point and approached the broad Chowan, it freshened to a fine whole-sail breeze. I remember feeling, as the trim schooner heeled to star- board with the wind from the open river, a sailor-like regret for the months I had idled away on shore.- I bared my brow to the breeze, and was on the point of promising myself to be at sea ere the moon waned, when there came from the weather-quarter (I was standing by the larboard bumpkin) the notes of  "Shades of evening, close not o'er us, Leave our lonely bark awhile." 1 recognized the voice of my Cousin Kate, accon- panied by those of Helen Jeffreys, the schoolmaster, and his sisters, in a second. I went aft, and'for a while my sea project was forgotten.

The'breeze -freshened. There was no moon; but there was not a cloud to be seen, and the heavens were glistening with a wilderness of stars.' The muddy Albe- marle was one broad sheet of foam, and, before we, passed the Perquimans we were obliged to take the bonnet off the jib and reef ourourses. The ladies, with the exception of my. Aunt Corny, still kept the' deck. The- schoolmaster went early below; the professor was forward, in the igonies of sea-sickness. -I took the helm from Old Joe, the mate, and the feeling of the tiller, as the littlI schooner bounded on, awoke all my old 'ove for the sea. I became somewhat excited. The lands- man can conceive no better idea'of the feeling than by remembering his own when mounted upon a. young, lithe, mettlesome horse. -         ' 'This reminds you of old times, I suppose," said Dr. Jeffreys. He was-standing, as he spoke, near the open cabin-door, where the light from the cabin-lamp partially exposed his fine features, as well as those of Helen, who was hanging on his arm.

I hope to be on the deck of my ship ere I am a week older." I looked at Helen as I uttered the last words; why I cannot well explain. Shehad apparently a design either of fathoming the mysteries of the mariner's compass and binnacle-lamp, or of inventing some improvement in one or the other, for I did not see her face for some minutes. When at last she did look up, she stepped hastily to the weather-side of the ,bench beneath the traveler, and seated herself by my Cousin Kate. A few moments later both went below. What's in the wind now, Gregory?" asked my uncle. "Nothing, sir, save that I wish to be at work." "At work?' And is there not sea room enough at Bucklersbury for yourself-and Bob?" "Abundance; but you know my father preferred ano- ther kind of furrows, and I confess that I have ac- quired-something of the same taste." "Since when?" asked the doctor, dryly. 1y uncle went growling below. The only audible words were, as he reached the foot of the ladder, "Never knew when he was well off; just like Brother John for all the world!" The doctor soon followed. The professor crept aft, and with a despairing look at the boiling foam through which the schooner was ploughing her way, spoke never a word, but crawled wearily to his berth. I staid some hours on deck, remaining at the helm until near midnight, when the wind suddenly lulled. Not caring to steer in a calm, I called Old Joe to relieve me. The captain had gone below for a nap, and we were alone on deck. The sea was running high, and there being but little wind to steady the vessel, she rolled and pitched in a style that   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.       207 set everything that was not-lashed into dire commotion.' The Jbooms swung and squeaked, the sails swayed to and fro with a fierce slat that set the blocks and run. ning-rigging into a deafening clatter. Old Joe was glad to get a tiller-rope for his support at. the helm, and even then his post was no, sinecure.' Meanwhile, from the depths of the cabin and hold (there were fifteen servants in the latter) came the notes of woe'. The sounds were unmistakeable. My Aunt Corny had companionship in her sea-sickness. In ludicrous contrast to the feminine outcry for-lights, and peppermint and brandy, rolled forth to upper air the growling bass of Professor Matters, in a heart-speaking groan.  "O-h-hh! A-h-h-! O Lord! is the boat a goin' tew sink? Oh! doctor! Colonel Smallwoodt Oh-h-h! Mr. Seaweather! Joe!" "Sah!" ,           X  . "Is it :blowin' much?" "Ya-a-s, mnaussa," replied Joe, in obedience to a hint from me; "an Irish huurricane." Kin I go up stairs?" "Better not come on deck, maussa. Mos' mawnin' by dis time." "O! Oh--h-h-h! E-be-NE-zer! how sick I am!" The wind sprung up at length, and, becoming sleepy, I wrapped my cloak around me and betook myself to a nap under the lee of the house. We anchored at sunrise off Nag's Head. ;In three days we. were domesticated. The professor was shown the lions; Roanoke Island, the 'Fresh Ponds, and the Inlet were visited in succession, and people laughed, during the professor's visit, " who never laughed before."  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC8061-00000103"/> 208        BE R T I E: On the last day, of -his visit (it was but a week), he delivered a free lecture on hydrology at the hotel, bade us a hasty adieu, and took the packet for Bertie. We heard nothing of him for some-days.- Time passed in the usual round of amusements, and we were'beginning to. wonder what cQuld' have become of him. A package of letters was brought usodne evening from the packet (there is-no post-office at Nag's Head), in which there were either letters or papers for nearly every member of the family. I was reading one from an, old shipmate, when Kate suddenly exclaimed- "See here! 'Married, onthe 25th inst., at , by the Rev. Mr. Phillips, Professor F. Matters to Mrs. Julia Blossom. "  - "I trust that the professor's conscientious scruples are now at rest," said my uncle, dryly; and he resumed the reading of his letters. "Didt you ever?" said my Aunt Corny, dropping her knitting-work; ."-who would have thought it? Well, there's no accounting for tastes." The evening passed. Weeks passed away, and Sep- tember was on the wane. We began to talk of going home. It was but a day or two before we left Nag's Head, that :I mounted a horse to accompany Kate and Helen to the -beach. The latter was mounted on a horse borrowied for the occasion; and I expressed some uneasiness at the arrange- ment. A gay laugh from both the ladies was my reward, and we galloped away. The sun was but a little way above the horizon, the air was cool and bracing, and the ladies were in excellent spirits. I had but a day or two before received a, favorable reply to my application for   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.        209 a ship, and my laugh was as- hearty and frequent as their own. As we galloped along the beach, we saw not far distant a group of children at play, seated upon the sand. The-roar of the breakers prevented their hearing our approach until we were very near them; when, startled by the'footfalls of our horses, a little girl sprang with a shriek to her feet. Her bonnet fell off, and was blown, beneath the feet of the horse on which Helen was. mounted. He reared and sprang forward, and his rider fell. It happened that she was nearest to the breakers. The beach fell somewhat abruptly. As I leaped from my horse to go to her assistance, she rose, and, un- conscious in her terror what she did, walked two or three steps directly towards the breakers, when a huge swell broke over her and carried her into the surf. It was but the work of a moment to plunge after her. I caught her arm, and as we were carried toward the shore, I got foot- ing on the sand ; and, lifting her in myarms, her weight saved us from being carried back. Before another wave could reach us, I had borne her beyond its-reach. My cousin Kate had had sufficient presence of mind to gal- lop homewards for assistance; the children, too, had fled, and as I laid the apparently lifeless form of the fair girl upon the beach, we were alone, Knowing that assistance would arrive. before I could reach the house, I still sup- ported her head; watching in an agony of terror for the approach of some one, and conjuring her to speak. Presently a low sigh reached my ear, and-'this was succeeded by a long-drawn respiration. Her eyes met mine.  "God bless you!" exclaimed she, faintly. I pressed my lips to her forehead.

The week pre- ceding our departure had brought such asad series of leave-takings, that the spirits of the whole household had been depressed. We left Nags Head a little before sun- set on a beautiful day, late in September. As we sailed onward towards home, there was some little effort to make the evening pass pleasantly. There was some chat of the friends we had left, and of home. Old Joe was called. upon to sing; and he accordingly gave us "The Parliament of England." The ladies, too, struck the air of more than one of the songs we haad been ac- customed to sing.. The night was beautiful. The sound was glistening in the moonlight; but, in spite of every effort, we-were all somewhat sad. The ladies retired, and the gentlemen followed their example. The schoolmaster was the last to leave the deck, and I remember being awaked by his cough as he came below. I awoke on the following morning at two o'clock. "Is that the Chowan?"I asked of the man at the helmn.  , .  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC8061-00000105"/> 212         BERTIE: "Dat's de Chowan." "And that is the light-boat at the mouth of the Ro- anoke?" "Yes, maussa."  "Then we are within an hour's sail of home?" "Yes, maussa." We were not'long in reaching the little creek. It was perhaps three o'clock when we let go our anchor. Dr. Jeffreys was aroused by the rattling of the cable. He came on deck, and, springing into the boat with me, we made our'way to the landing at Underwood. After a three hours' sleep at the house, we returned to the schooner for our party; and at nicne o'clock we were all gathered round the hospitable board at his home. There was but one thing to mar the'pleasure of our return, and that was the illness of the schoolmaster. From the veryday of our arrival he-grew worse, and we again began to despair of his recovery. Yet he rallied occasionally, and there were yet, we thought, some grounds for hope. On the first mail-day'after our return, there came, among other letters, one for Mr. Barney O'Brien. Besides his, there came cards' from Mr. and Mrs. Matters, invit- ing us to attend a party to be given at their residence a week from that day. I have omitted to say that an Irish overseer on a southern plantation is the greatest of rarities. I do not believe that I have met ten Irishmen in both Carolina and Virginia. Barney O'Brien was a cabin-boy on board the ship in which my father was- wrecked. He was afterwards taken into the employ- ment of my uncle, and became his overseer. His story was that he had run away from home for the sake of be-   A HUMOROUS 0NOVEL..      213 coming a sailor. .My uncle had induced him to write to his friends..

Barney was summoned to'the house after tea; and my Aunt Corny, being deputized to decipher the epistle; read as follows-        ' "' ENNIS, March 20th, 1849.

While in the house he succeeded tolerably well'; bit, as he shut the gate in leaving the yard, he threw his hat high in air, and went through divers evolutions, which, so far as I have observed, were eminently national. The Sarah Porter being bound to Norfolk with a load of staves, Barney embarked the next morning. The colonel had filled his cup of mundane felicity to the brim by offering him a substantial house rent free, and assuring him that his mother and Nora should be as welcome as the flowers in May. It may have been ten days later that my uncle had invited his neighbors to spend the day ~with him. The professor and his lady, whose party we had' duly at- tended, were summoned; and they arrived in high fea- ther. The tables groaned that day beneath a genuine old-fashioned Carolina dinner. We sat long over the dessert; and it was agreed before we left the table that the whole party should meet again at Cypress Shore at Christmas. The guests had not been gone half an hour when Barney arrived. With genuine Irish impetuosity, he had carried the heart of Nora by storm ; and the bright-eyed girl blushed to her temples when, after mak- ing us acquainted with his mother, he exclaimed--   A HUMOROUS NOVEL.               215 "An' this is me own Nora Mahoney."

This was dauly given them by little Molly, who distributed the whisky with the air of a queen. The colonel came into the piazza rubbing his hands, and caught her in his arms in a genuine doting hug. Breakfast was announced, and we had barelyleft the table when a loud shout betokened the arrival' of the hero of the Christmas frolic. We hastened to the door.

Before noon the wind hauled to the northeast, and, the ground was soon white with snow. It fell rapidly, and the wind sent it whirling against the window-panes, giving us a keen sense of the comforts of the genuine Christmas fires that blazed and roared in three of the principal rooms of my uncle's,mansion. The professor seemed devoted to the c'harming woman whom, he had so recently led to the altar, and whose 'contagious mer- riment was the life of the party. Bob and Kate were chatting in low tones in one corner of the ordinary- sit- ting-room; perhaps about the improvements at Buck- lersbury-who  knows?  Mr. Snowden, Lieutenant Buckthorn, the Misses Haynes, and Madam Jeffreys formed another group; Madam  Buckthorn,-my Aunt -Corny, Madama Butterton, with the -colonel and the squire formed a third; while' in another room,.were Madam Haynes, Helen Jeffreys, the schoolmaster, Uncle Baldy, the professor and his -ady; and myself.

The. table was laden -at length with its unwonted burden; and ample justice was done my uncle's cheer, as well as to the housewifery of my Aunt Corny and the housekeeper. It was sunset when coffee was handed round, and the storm was still raging so violently as to forbid all thoughts of leaving the house: Accordingly, the guests remained.

The line parted, the boat heeled to port, and the professor turned a somerset- which would have immortalized him in the ring-into the river. A shout of laughter greeted him as he rose above the surface, and climbed into the boat (he had pre- tended, the reader will remember, that -he was not a swimmer), and this was succeeded by a roar, as he angrily. exclaimed-          ' H:"Human natur!

And, speaking of the practical'ideas of the age, the reader may happen tQ remember that the Hudson and Champlain Canal crosses the Hudson River. A poetic youth was crossing it, not a hundred years ago, as a pas- senger in a canal-scow, in the undimmed smile of a full moon. With a thought of Venice and her gondolas, perhaps of Portia and Jessica, he ventured to say to the unpoetical man at the helm, defensively posted in the entrenchmentsof a monkey-jacket and sou'wester, that the Hudson was a beautiful river.

Accordingly, the colonel, mJy Aunt Corny, and myself, seated. ourselves in the carrage, about ten o'clock that morning, for the drive. On the way, we met Dr. Jeffreys, who was just returning from the cottage; and who, in answer to our questions, gave ,  .

"Eh? what's the matter, friend Haynes?" said my uncle, with an attempt at cheerfulness. O, consumption, I suppose!" said the schoolmaster, gloomily. "The last chapter of a worthless volume." "Fudge! cheer up, man. We'll have you out a fox- hunting in a week.", The invalid smiled faintly, as if knowing and appre- ciating the colonel's motive in attempting to encourage him. We spent some hours with him, and it was late when we returned home. I returned to the cottage at nightfall, and passed the night with him. He rallied towards morning, and conversed with me. "Has my book come?' he asked. "Not yet." "It should be here. My publisher promised me that it should go into the hands of the printer as soon aA he should receive the MS. Is not to-morrow mail-day?"

Pshaw, sir! they talk insanely, both the North and the South." Talking in this way at intervals, he at length fell into a sort ofcoma, which continued for many hours. He then awoke, but sunk rapidly until it was apparent that he could' survive but a few hours. I can never forget the scene. The mother came into the sick-room and sat wearily down, burying her face in her hands. Her daughters came in a few minutes afterward, in time to hear the expiring sigh.

I have hurried over these details, good reader, for they are the record of the darkest hours of my long visit in Bertie. As if in mockery of his hopes, his book came from the publisher's the very day after his funeral.. It was a melancholy satisfaction to us to read the pages which he had written while yet vigorous an'd apnbitious' of worldly honor.

My surprise may be imagined when, on the following lay, .1 saw a handbill, running as follows:- -   GREAT ATTRACTION! FREE LECTURE AT THE MUSEUM! Professor Matters, who has just returned from the South, will deliver, this evening, in place of the usual theatrical performance, a lecture on HYDROLOGY-A NEW SYSTEM!  Professor Matters will also make some remarks on THE SOUTH AND ITS INSTITUTIONS, and give his impressions of the South.          t -i FOR ONE EVENING ONLY!  I would have given the world to have heard the lec- ture; but I was to-haul out that very evening, and there was so much to be done that I was obliged to forego the pleasure. My last errand on shore was to the post-office, t where I was so fortunate as to find letters from Bertie. The first I opened was the following :- "CYPRESS SHORE, Jan. 5th, 1849.   5 "MY DEAR COUSIN:-In the name of all the gods, why did you steal away without bidding me good-by? The old gentleman says it is 'just like you ;' and both    -A.

You can have no idea how mnuch we missed  you. ,Grief came back blubbering like a school-boy. Ponto:and Alice wandered about all the morning, as if in search of you" and the day wore away gloomy enough.' I never knew my good father so testy, even in an"' east": ' wind; and Aunt Corny's.knitting has increased from its chronic character to the acute symptoms. I doubt if  :  there is any way to stop her now. "How I wish I could have seen you before you went !  s  Let me say in your ear that I would give the world to go  with you. The wedding is deferred (may the gods con- found all meddlers!) until next Christmas, when, they  say,,you'll be here, and participate in the solemnities of that mournful occasion ! By the by, did you ever' hear the farce 'The Happiest Day of my Life,' wherein, 'at  the solemnization of the- marriage, father, mother, rela- tions, and friends, bride and bridegroom, all blubber-in chorus? Aunt Corny must have seen the performance, for she is beginning already to sigh, and wonders' what she will do when Kate is gone?' "I wish I were with you. By the powers I do! How shall I endure a year in the wilds of Bucklersbury ? The time seems an eternity to me. You, lucky dog! will walk the quarter-deck of your ship, be seeing new places in distant climes, and have. something to divert your attention; while the presence of Kate will be to me a perennial aggravation ! Why should we wtit? "I shall get wrathy if I say any more about'that. We are well. Dr. Jeffreys and Helen have just come.

They both begged to be remembered in the family greeting which I send you from all; and det me say in your ear) a certain fair lady's voice trembled as she bade me tell you be with us at Christmas, iunder pain of perpetual exile. Good-by." The year is not yet past, yet I have been a fortnight at home. The foregoing pages are the work of my lei- sure hours at sea. Would that you could have been with me, my dear reader, as I lingered at Fayal and Gibraltar, and ran along the most beautiful of seas-the Mediterranean. I spoke the frigate C on my way home, and Lieutenant Buckthorn is, out of question, now at Norfolk. The young clergyman is here, nominally, though, in fact, he is domiciled at the cottage near Un- derwood (they call it Sycamore Cottage) with Madam Haynes and her daughters. He is so frank as to say that he finds bachelor quarters at the parsonage unendurable, and the probabilityis that Miss Mary Haynes will soon make an effort to enliven the place. Miss Laura is observed to pay particular attention to the department of Ship news in all the papers, and it is supposed that the movements of the frigate C have a very particular interest for her. Barney has avowed his opinion that the almanac- makers are at fault, and that they have omitted the nl 2 O }      s  t    A HUMOROUS HOVEL.       2t1. Christmas holidays in thi year's calendar. Nora teases him mercilessly, andhe is leading a sad life, of it. Bob has done wonders at Bucklersbury, and talks about buildi ng and removing there. He' will stay, however, (or I am no seer) at Cypress Shore, and Mrs Kate Small- wood will do" the honors, vice Aunt Corny, resigned. There will be four:weddings on Christmas day; yes, five, for Barney insists that his own shall take place on that day or never! Nora will probably capitulate. It lacks ten days of Christmas. The'night is beautiful. The new moon has long since set, but the sky is cloud- less; the stars are glittering in a sea of silver light that is'reflected from the unruffled surface of the Albemarle. The light-boat shows the friendly beacon at the mouth of the Roanoke; the katydids are noisily chattering in the elms; old Ponto is asleep on the rug, dreaming, if I may judge by his motions, of a battle with some indomitable coon. I can hear, from the kitchen, the notes of Grief's violin ; and, if my ears do not deceive me, the stentorian voice of old Peter Law at his evening devotions. When I left the parlor, an hour ago, to retire to my chamber, the colonel was laughing over the pages of Dr. Holmes' poems. Bob and Kate were pretending to play at backgammon, but, in reality, chatting. My Aunt Corny was knitting, and Molly was bothering her with endless questions about Christmas and the John Kooner. And now, my dear reader, farewell. As Professor Matters would say, perhaps we may meet again some- where. I see by the Norfolk Beacon newspaper that the frigate C-- has arrived. The lieutenant will soon be here then. Once more---Stay! what is this among the "professional cards?" 21"- , . *   &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC8061-00000120"/> 242        .  BERoTIE.  ' , PROF.
