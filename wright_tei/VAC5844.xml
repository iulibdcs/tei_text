            <head>GLEASON'S PICTORIAL DRAWING-ROOM COMPANION.</head>
            <head type="sub">A RECORD OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND USEFUL IN ART.</head>
            <p>The object of this paper is to present, in the most elegant and available form, a weekly literary melange of notable events of the day. Its columns are devoted to original tales, sketches and poems, by the BEST AMERICAN AUTHORS, and the cream of the domestic and foreign news; the whole well spiced with wit and humor. Each paper is BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED with numerous accurate engravings, by eminent artists, of notable objects, current events in all parts of the world, and of men and manners, altogether making a paper entirely original in its design in this country. Its pages contain views of every populous city in the known world, of all buildings of note in the eastern or western hemisphere, of all the principal ships and steamers of the navy and merchant service, with fine portraits of every noted character in the world, male and female. Sketches of beautiful scenery, taken from life, are also given, with numerous specimens from the animal kingdom, the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea. The Pictorial is now printed on the finest of paper, from a font of new and beautiful type, manufactured expressly for it,—presenting in its mechanical execution an elegant specimen of art. It contains fifteen hundred and sixty-four square inches, giving a great amount of reading matter and illustrations—a mammoth weekly paper of sixteen octavo pages. It forms THE BEST FAMILY PAPER, inasmuch as its aim is constantly, in connection with the fund of amusement it affords, and the rich array of original miscellany it presents, to inculcate the strictest and highest tone of morality, and to encourage virtue by holding up to view all that is good and pure, and avoiding all that is evil in its tendency. In short, the object is to make the paper loved, respected, and sought after for its combined excellences.</p>

                  <p>VERY brilliant and very fashionable—for the country at any rate—was the assembly at the house of Mr. Alfred Laybach, on an evening memorable for some things, years ago. Memorable for rain and mud and mire, in which finely polished boots and thin slippers could not help but get an occasional splash, even though they came in carriages; memorable for mortified faces of gentlemen, who came in no conveyance at all, and did not like to have the fact proclaimed so openly as it was by the mud. Other circumstances, more important than these, though they seemed but small at the time, grew up from seeds sown then, and made the evening lastingly to be remembered, and sighed over, and regretted. Indeed, one would not have thought that any of the happy faces and light hearts which inspired the conversation and enlivened the dance on that evening would ever have occasion to look back upon it and almost curse the glittering lights, the music and the wine that led astray at least one heart with their false glare. Yet so it was; at least so we fear to find it.</p>
                  <p>The dwelling of Mr. Laybach was one of those fine old mansions—and yet not extremely old; enough so to have gathered around it a little of timely veneration—which are not rare along the Hudson River. Situated to command a fine view of the river, and its white sails; surrounded by a wide lawn and trees, it was and is the ideal of gouty old merchants, who have spent their lives in the city heaping up gold, as well as of the fortunate literary man, who has been able to reap enough of fortune from his fame to allow him to think of embodying <emph>one</emph> dream of his fancy in a reality. To the first class Mr. Laybach belonged. The reward of a youth and middle age spent in the engrossing cares of business was the possession of a fortune which enabled him to pass the fag end of his days—or, using the parlance of his own trade, "the poor and cheap remnant of his web of life"—in rural, yet luxurious and elegant quiet. How much or how well he enjoyed it; whether or not this brief respite of ease repaid him for a life spent in acquiring far more than was at all necessary<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5844-00000004"/> to secure the same end, we cannot say, and will not pretend to inquire. He had a fortune—a large fortune. A wife, horses and carriages, a fine house and grounds. Call him happy, then, ye poor starvelings, who in your garrets write and dream of these, and only in dreams ever possess them. There is, at any rate, no violence done to supposition.</p>
                  <p>We will, however, take the liberty of disturbing this fancied happiness—as far as it may be imagined to be complete—by mentioning the absence of one thing not included in the above inventory, usually reckoned necessary to the felicity of married people; it is a child. They had none. And as, at all events, men and women will long for things which when obtained are the greatest plagues of life, we suppose that Mr. and Mrs. Laybach were not perfectly satisfied with their lot. He had no one to perpetuate his name, and keep up the memory of his credit on 'change. She had no one to occupy her leisure hours in looking after; to manage and scheme for, as women are wont and love to do for their daughters.</p>
                  <p>So, as is proper in such cases, they did the best they could; and since Providence had denied them one who might rightly inherit their name and claim their fortune, they very benevolently took to their care and love a friendless, at least we suppose a friendless, orphan, who came no one knew whither. And as Mr. and Mrs. Laybach did not bestow their name upon the stranger, but called her, as she called herself, simply Maria Seeley, none seemed to know, or could understand either, how or upon what footing in their family she stood. If they intended to adopt her, to make her heir of their wealth, why, inquired anxious young gentlemen covetous of horses and carriages, house and grounds, did they not so proclaim it to the world? It would have been, no doubt, a great relief to the aforesaid young gentlemen, if Mr. and Mrs. Laybach had complied with their wishes. But they did not. So everybody continued to be puzzled, and many to exhibit that fact in such a manner as must have furnished abundant amusement for the quiet hours of the retired merchant and his lady. Undoubtedly they had their purposes. But fortune-hunters stood doubting, half inclined and half afraid to become the declared admirers of the lovely and gentle Maria. The circumstance of this party, which seemed to be given for her, revived many hopes before sunk and deadened.</p>
                  <p>Rain, rain; mud, mire and bad temper. Oaths and grumbling, on every note of the gamut, of sour-tempered coachmen, suppressed on the part of gentlemen, because in the presence of ladies; painfully delicate shrieks, ejaculations and so forth from the ladies themselves; and the clouds, if anything, growing blacker, and still rain, rain. So it was out of doors on the evening mentioned. Inside, obsequious servants, and continued rushing up stairs into side dressing-rooms; brandy bottles, gloves, brushes and Macassar oil on the gentlemen's side; head dresses, gloves, perfumes, and all that—only <emph>not</emph> the brandy, we suppose—among the ladies; meetings on the stairs, and profuse and stately bowings in the parlors; great display of well fitting boots and small hands gloved by Alexander, and diamond rings sometimes glittering over the faultless kids. Some careless or rustic <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ton,</foreign> too, there might be, without any diamond ring or glove either, and in frock coat like enough. These, of course, all the well dressed <emph>snobs</emph>—your pardon, Pendennis!—looked down upon and sneered inwardly at behind white expressionless faces.</p>
                  <p>Among the crowd of beauty, which on that night outshone the chandeliers, Maria Seeley was not, it must be allowed, by any means the most conspicuous. Yet there was an attraction about her which, though not striking at a distance, wound itself about and penetrated with magnetic quickness into the hearts of those who came near her, and heard the tones of her voice, and stood beneath the glances of her eyes. The graces of expression came to the aid of a countenance not entirely symmetrical, and added something of the brilliant with the sweetness and gentleness which charmed, but which one was forbid to say was a weakness of temper, or any way <emph>dowdyish</emph> or rustic.</p>
                  <p>This was, indeed, just that mistake which young Ledger, whose father had got rich in Wall Street, dabbling in copper stocks—if the Indians were not then the only dealers in that article—fell into on this very evening. A mistake he was glad enough, or rather mortifyingly, was compelled to correct; when after saying many things to Maria which he would not otherwise have presumed to say, he was glad to turn away from the sofa on which she sat, to hide his own discomfiture. At least one person observed this, and was gratified by it, and hastily took the vacant seat by her side, for which he had been anxiously holding himself in readiness during all the time in which Ledger had engrossed her attention tion. That was Mr. Jacob Leavitt, quite a near neighbor of Mr. Laybach, and an intimate friend besides. Young, he certainly was not, yet did not appear to be old; at least from his dress one would not suspect such a thing. Neither would you from the manner of his address to Maria, and the constant attention he seemed desirous of paying her. While the dance was in progress, at any rate, one could not have heard without particular effort, what Mr. Leavitt was saying to her in such a low tone; though he would have had no difficulty in understanding by her lively replies, which she took no pains to pronounce in an unusually low tone, that they were of that gallant character belonging to ball-rooms, and which you are at liberty to believe or disbelieve.</p>
                  <p>Young Ledger had changed his partner in the dance, which now for the nonce pirouetted to an end; he at least was much better pleased with his new companion, and led her to a seat with the air of a conqueror, and went away soon with the pleasing consciousness. If he had remained a little longer—but even then he would not have heard the tone in which the supposedly vanquished pair spoke of the supposed visitor. He did not understand Ellen Leavitt. And, in fact, he might have despaired of ever understanding her, or any woman at all, we would have added; since if anybody can do it, and even if they can understand themselves, it certainly will require some brain better accustomed to sinuous threading of unknown paths which never come to the same end twice, and oftener still come to no end or outlet at all.</p>
                  <p>"What has your partner been saying to please you so?" asked one of her lady friends, coming up leaning on the arm of Mr. Sanford, whom, if she was not desirous of getting rid of, she might have known better than to expose to the fascinations of Ellen.</p>
                  <p>"O, nothing," gaily returned she; "'tis that which pleases me."</p>
                  <p>"He boasts of two conquests this evening, so I hear. I imagined you might be one."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, no doubt; and yet I think I should like to have him—for my lady's maid. Mr. Sanford," she added, rapidly turning the point of remark, "you look like a funeral; excuse me, but I do not allow any of my knights, if you are one, to keep on such a sorrowful countenance."</p>
                  <p>"The expression must be natural. I am not aware of any unusual degree of that sort of feeling," he returned.</p>
                  <p>"Well, sit down here, then, and prove it by amusing me. I am so tired of talking nonsense for the last half hour. Do say something sensible."</p>
                  <p>"I am happy—"</p>
                  <p>"I will not believe it, if you begin paying compliments. I am sure that is the beginning of one."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps not. I might have said something excessively ill-natured, if you had allowed me."</p>
                  <p>"I shall be delighted! Do abuse somebody! I am quite out of humor. There is Maria Seeley, who is quite outshining me. If you wish to gain my favor, say she is not handsome, and all those beaux around her are fools."</p>
                  <p>"What, and your worthy uncle among them! It is the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">on dit</foreign> (I suppose you know it, though) that he is one of her most devoted admirers, and servant to command."</p>
                  <p>A slight frown passed over Ellen's face. "For all that," she returned, somewhat tartly, "I shall not forbid you to say what you please."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, I think that Miss Seeley is about eighteen, and Mr. Leavitt, forty."</p>
                  <p>"Admirable! You are as laconic as a Spartan. Now, then, tell me your conquests this evening."</p>
                  <p>"I should rather have to confess that I am enslaved myself—bound hand and foot."</p>
                  <p>"By Maria Seeley, of course; and you tell that to <emph>me?</emph> I am half a mind to send you directly over to her; you are as great a simpleton as the others."</p>
                  <p>"You are always too fast. Why did it not occur to you to think of yourself?"</p>
                  <p>"You do not prove it; you do not do as I wish you to."</p>
                  <p>"If I only knew your wish, you should not say so."</p>
                  <p>"Stupid," exclaimed Ellen, with a playful but impatient flirt of her fan, "must I tell you every word like a schoolmistress? There is my uncle," glancing significantly in the direction of Maria; "I know Miss Seeley must be tired of his ogling and soft sentiments, and he has kept her from dancing this last hour. Do you need telling what is your duty?"</p>
                  <p>There was a flash in the eye of the brilliant girl, as she said this—an expression on her face which did not demand a comprehension capable of reading the riddle of the Sphynx, to understand. Mr. Sanford, who was well known to be one of her many followers, had no difficulty in taking the hint; and from others, when aside,<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5844-00000005"/> remarks might have been heard intimating that the speakers well comprehended the cause of her dissatisfaction at the apparent influence of Maria Seeley over her wealthy bachelor uncle. We say apparent influence, not because we have any doubt about it, but because it was apparent to everybody, except Maria (who did not dream of such a thing), that Mr. Leavitt was a willing slave to her attractions; and gossip, which is always ready to seize hold of such an affair as a very delicate morsel indeed, already discussed the fact, and passed its thousand and one opinions upon it—the probabilities of its going beyond its present state, and how it would affect other parties; what those other parties would think of it, and so forth.</p>
                  <p>Jacob Leavitt, let it be known, besides being a near neighbor of Mr. Laybach, also had house and grounds, and wealth still greater. He was a bachelor, too; was it not natural, therefore, that his only nephew and niece should be somewhat interested in him, and willing enough to take the kindest possible care of him, so that he might never feel the need of any other consolation to enable him to go quietly and contentedly down to his grave when the time came? Such, indeed, was understood to be their solicitude for his earthly happiness. Ellen and Mark Leavitt had even endeavored to induce their uncle to give up his own solitary establishment, and go and live with them. They were fearful that such a lonely life would induce thoughts of companionship, undoubtedly. That is why gossip said so confidently, that Ellen Leavitt and Mark Leavitt, who does not yet appear bodily upon the stage, were strongly fearful of Maria Seeley's influence, unwittingly exerted; and why Ellen expressed to Mr. Sanford so much solicitude that her uncle's platitudes might weary the ear of Maria. That is why she saw with so much satisfaction Mr. Sanford obtain the honor of dancing with her—albeit he did not much fancy his commission, and had some faint idea that he was being made a tool of. While Mr. Leavitt, who did not dance, sat in inward misery upon the sofa, and talked somewhat at random, perhaps, letting his eyes follow the airy form of Mr. Sanford's partner, as she in her high, young spirits threaded the mazes of the dance, and laughed and talked, and amused herself during the pauses with Mr. Sanford's observations, quite unconscious, too, of the envy and jealousy which gleamed out of some eyes at Mr. Sanford, and the pangs which her smiles inflicted in the bosom of somebody who sat upon a sofa and did not smile, but frowned inwardly, as we said before, and was not far from being in a rage, when some other middle-aged gentlemen, who also did not dance, suggested the idea that they and he belonged below among the whist tables. At any other time the proposition would have been more satisfactory; he liked nothing better, one would judge, than to visit the house of Mr. Laybach when there was not enough to make up a hand without Maria, whom he was delighted to have as a partner. At present, however, he was not at all pleased with the idea of leaving the dancers, notwithstanding he did not dance; not half so well, indeed, as seemed his niece, who could hardly conceal her exultation when he did soon retire with Mr. Laybach and others, who did not look, and did not think themselves so young as Mr. Leavitt.</p>
                  <p>O, selfishness, ambition!—in a woman, too! How such passions rust out or eat up the heart, and all that is loveable and admirable in the daughters of Eve.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be supposed that Ellen Leavitt, who was a belle, and loved admiration like other belles, had any such unselfish love for Maria Seeley that she would dismiss her own followers for her sake; especially one like Mr. Sanford, who was not at all to be despised. When, therefore, her good uncle, whom she thought in danger, was fairly out of the way, her pleasure in seeing Mr. Sanford still by the side of Maria, was, as may be imagined, not of the liveliest kind. It was plain enough, that what he undertook as a commission, he was contented to pursue after the object of that was ended; perhaps, too, presuming to think that he detected a shade of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pique</foreign> upon the face of Ellen, he was not unwilling to take his own revenge upon her. It would have been perfectly natural for him to do so.</p>
                  <p>"Has Miss Seeley discarded you, that you return so soon?" she replied to his address, when he had finally resigned the presence of Maria.</p>
                  <p>"You are as unreasonable as ever, to suppose so. It is not necessary that I should be discarded anywhere," he added, more gallantly, "to induce me to present myself before Miss Leavitt."</p>
                  <p>"Unreasonable!" she exclaimed, taking no notice of the compliment. "Am I, then, to consider Mr. Sanford as my tutor?" she asked, with a half-covered sneer.</p>
                  <p>"I should be proud of the office," he returned, "if you would only allow me to tutor you to be less fascinating, even in your displeasure."</p>
                  <p>What lady would not relent at such a gallant speech? She could not help it, thought she still pretended to frown.</p>
                  <p>"Go," said she, with the old flirt of the fan, "you are an expert flatterer, I confess; but save your skill for Miss Seeley." By which remark she did not at all mean to be understood as she expressed herself. Indicating at this moment her wish to retire, her example was soon followed by the rest.</p>
                  <p>Still it rained. The mud grew deeper, coachmen grumbled even harder than before at being called from the comfortable kitchen where they, too, had been having a kind of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">reunion</foreign>—with only Betty, the housemaid, and Bridget, the cook, however, to smile and ogle, and the smiles and ogles to be divided among a dozen. Jealousies and heart-burnings there were, therefore, without doubt, down stairs as well as above; and upon the coach-boxes, as well as inside upon the warm cushions, and lying against the rich linings. It is true, at any rate, that Ellen Leavitt sat upon the padded seat and leaned against the padded linings of the coach as it struggled homeward through the mud, and thought with <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pique</foreign> and vexation of some things which had occurred that evening; with deeper feelings still of something which she had not noticed for the first time then.</p>
                  <p>Mr. and Mr. Laybach, too, after the lights were out, and the piled-up clouds reigned supreme over the darkness, thought seriously about something, and talked in grave tones about it; and Maria thought, no doubt, but only how she had been pleased and entertained, and over what pretty things had been said to her, with a pardonable vanity at eighteen; over the meaning looks, too, and attentions paid, and not at all, poor soul, upon any such unpleasant idea as that any one was jealous, envious, or in any manner at enmity with her. And so sleep came on pleasantly and quietly, and morning came with the remembrance of pleasant and undisturbed dreams. Some future morning she may wake, possibly, to the other part; but let us not anticipate.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE OFFER, AND THE RESULT.</head>
                  <p>THOUSANDS, philosophers and otherwise, have written upon love; but no two that we ever heard of could agree freely upon the subject. An old wit says, however: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Love is a fire which burns and sparkles</l>
                           <l>In men as nat'rally as in charcoals."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a Proteus of a thousand shapes. "'Tis something, nothing;" it is anything you please.</p>
                  <p>If, then, this flame is made to burn in a breast which kindles no more with the fire of youth; if a volcano is planted (metaphorically speaking) beneath a mountain whose head is capped with snow, consider, it is one of the consistent inconsistencies of the variable and shifting passion.</p>
                  <p>One day, shortly after the scene described in the preceding chapter, Maria Seeley sat, with a young lady friend, by an open window in the second story of the mansion of Mr. Laybach. This friend, though it does not matter much, we may as well mention was Miss Lee, the daughter of the rector of one of the churches of P——. They were inseparable companions, and loved each other—only, of course, with young ladies' love, about which I say nothing, but which Shakspeare intimates a slight opinion of. However, they were now sitting together, as we have said, and interspersed the laborious trifling which doubtless they were engaged in, with a conversation on a subject of interest, and peculiar interest.</p>
                  <p>"Maria," said Miss Lee, in a half confidential, half bantering tone, "do you know that you have made a conquest?"</p>
                  <p>"A conquest!—of who, pray?" in unfeigned wonder replied Maria.</p>
                  <p>"Of Mr. Leavitt."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Leavitt! Which, Mark or Jacob?" inquired Maria.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Jacob Leavitt, of course—everybody says so," replied Miss Lee.</p>
                  <p>Maria burst into a ringing laugh. "It is nonsense," she replied.</p>
                  <p>"Nevertheless, I insist that it is true," returned her friend. "I did not have my eyes shut the other evening when, I think, he played the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">role</foreign> of lover admirably."</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw! he is old enough to be my father."</p>
                  <p>"And rich enough to buy you, if you were made of gold," rejoined Miss Lee.</p>
                  <p>"That makes no difference. I will not marry for <emph>money,</emph>" Maria replied, earnestly and energetically. "Would you believe that of me, Mary?" added she, in the same serious tone.</p>
                  <p>"O, no, of course not," returned Miss Lee, in a rather evasive tone. "But then I think he is quite an Adonis."</p>
                  <p>"I do not admire Adonises of fifty," said Maria. "Decidedly, Mr. Leavitt had better think of the grave than the altar."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, you say so; but you would not refuse him, I think. <emph>I</emph> wouldn't," she added, with a pretty pout.</p>
                  <p>"I shall hint to Mr. Leavitt," returned Maria, banteringly, "that he has only to speak, and the fair Mary Lee, who is only eighteen, and longs for an establishment, will become a blushing bride. It will be winter and spring united."</p>
                  <p>"There is Mr. Leavitt's carriage at this moment," exclaimed Miss Lee, "coming up the avenue. I must go."</p>
                  <p>"You shall not; I wish you to protect me against any such danger as you threaten me with." And Maria playfully, but successfully, attempted to detain her friend, without, however, having the slightest idea that she should be called on to go down into the parlor, since Mr. and Mrs. Laybach were both at home. She was not a little confused, therefore, when the gentleman's card was handed to her.</p>
                  <p>"I shall insist on your going down, of course," said she to Miss Lee; and Miss Lee, of course, having consented to stay, could not refuse.</p>
                  <p>While the young ladies are engaged in that mysterious operation of the toilet, which has such marvellous properties for plain people, and is withal the source of so much impatience in gentlemen who are obliged to wait meanwhile, and do not happen to have anything to occupy their thoughts, let us take the opportunity to ramble a little, and speculate a little also upon this affair of—love shall we call it, when there was no love, on one side at least, in the affair at all.</p>
                  <p>That there <emph>was</emph> something of the sort on <emph>one</emph> side people thought they were not mistaken in supposing; even Mr. and Mrs. Laybach suspected as much, and more than that, to them the suspicion was not at all unpleasing. They had even made the subject already a matter of serious conversation between themselves; and as they were quite too well advanced in life to look upon things with romantic eyes, but on the contrary quite naturally took the worldly point of view, they had already come to the conclusion that a union between their young and much loved charge and the wealthy and very respectable Mr. Leavitt would be indeed an advantageous and desirable thing in every respect. Therefore, they were prepared beforehand to give the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">passee</foreign> suitor, whose age might have been in the way, all the encouragement on their part which he might desire.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps, it is true, he did not desire any. Perhaps other people were troubling themselves about a matter which he had not even thought of. He might have neither intention nor wish to enter into what Sir Peter Teazle calls "the happy state." He had made no unmistakable declarations to that effect.</p>
                  <p>It was apparent, however, to all observers, that Mr. Leavitt did not look upon the young and attractive Maria with anything like indifference; that, indeed, if a man of fifty years may be a victim to the strongest passion of youth, he was violently attracted towards her by some such feelings. It is not to be supposed that he would write sonnets to her eyebrows, or make known his sentiments in languishing glances or sentimental serenades.</p>
                  <p>He was fifty years old, remember. Love is a serious business at that time of life, as everything else is—perhaps, indeed, a <emph>mere</emph> matter of business.</p>
                  <p>Undoubtedly Mr. Leavitt had begun latterly to feel the loneliness of bachelor life. When he sat down by his parlor grate of an evening alone, he began also to miss something which should be there, and was not. Thereupon he ruminated and looked in the glass.</p>
                  <p>One does not ordinarily look into a glass for the sake simply of admiring one's self. All sorts of gallant conspiracies are reflected from the parasitical plate.</p>
                  <p>What reflections presented themselves to Mr. Leavitt, as he furtively attempted to cover a bald spot on his head with a foreign lock, we might perhaps venture to guess. It was only the morning afterwards which saw his carriage going down the avenue leading to the house of Mr. Laybach, in whose parlor a while ago we left Mr. Leavitt sitting.</p>
                  <p>With the usual keen sightedness of a woman in matters of this kind, Mary Lee detected, as she thought, in the manner of Mr. Leavitt something of embarrassment, unusual in one so polished and generally self-possessed. She suspected that if she, Mary Lee, were absent, Mr. Leavitt, who now talked constrainedly, would be very grateful to her; so presently, with quite apparent surprise, she remembered a promise she had made to be home by a certain time, already well nigh expired, and consequently would hear no solicitations to remain any longer.</p>
                  <p>After she had gone, and after a time spent rather awkwardly, Maria, who was surprised at Mr. Leavitt's demeanor, had the climax added by receiving from him a formal offer of marriage.<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5844-00000007"/> A little more <emph>formal,</emph> indeed, than suited Maria, or young ladies generally would have loved in such an affair. There was certainly little romance in it; quite in princely form indeed, in which not much is said about love till afterward.</p>
                  <p>Maria was still surprised, and did not throw herself into Mr. Leavitt's arms. On the contrary, with considerable maidenly reserve, she hinted at the unexpected nature of his proposal; the necessity also of consulting as well her own heart, as those who stood to her in the relation of parents. Mr. Leavitt, who was not too violent in his protestations, and did not fall into despair because the answer was not immediate and unqualified, assented to the delay with admirable grace. He took his departure soon, and likely enough for his consolation repeated to himself the maxim, "The woman who deliberates is lost;" in order to vary it, however, by making another equally true, that she who deliberates in an affair of this kind is also won.</p>
                  <p>But if this Strephon of fifty years had been able to see the exhibition of mirth which Maria could not control as she gazed after him, undoubtedly he would not have returned home so complacently as he did. Nothing is so deadening to a sentiment of love, as a touch of the ridiculous; and a woman who can laugh at her lover is pretty decidedly <emph>not</emph> in love with him. Poverty, misfortune, even crime, will not destroy a woman's passion; but let the lover be careful of ever awkwardly making a fall into a mudpuddle, or getting himself into any other laughable predicament. It is certain death to the tender passion.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding her mirth, which lasted only a brief while, and gave way soon to other feelings, that night the pillow of Maria was the scene of a mental conflict—the first serious one which she had ever encountered. The idea of treating the affair as an admirable jest, which she might amuse herself with for half a life, was very soon dispelled by a consultation with Mr. Laybach, who treated it soberly, and advised acceptance of the offer. That advice could not fail to have its weight; since, though the uniform kindness with which Mr. and Mrs. Laybach treated her forbid the supposition that it was selfish, she could not help reflecting, now that the subject was presented to her, that after all she was merely a dependent upon their bounty, to which she had no claim. Doubtless she did not omit to consider, also, the brilliant fortune, of which she might become the mistress; indeed, that was not to be left out of sight by any one. What conclusion, therefore, could she come to?—what conclusion could any reasonable young lady in a like situation come to, but the one she did finally adopt, after long thought and much misgiving? <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"The strongest castle, tower and town,</l>
                           <l>The golden bullet beats it down."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> And though unquestionably she would have refused a poor lover of fifty years, yet, under all the circumstances, she resolved to accept Mr. Leavitt, houses and grounds being thereunto appurtenant. We will not pretend to defend her; we will only do her the justice to say, that she acted out the instincts of her sex.</p>
                  <p>Alas! how many of these mercenary barterings of youth and beauty for Dives's riches and purple—these gilded mockeries of the Divine institution of marriage—are going on in this world! How many young beings stand up before the holy altar, solemnly perjuring themselves with false vows to "love, honor and obey," when it is only the splendid mansion and the coach and four that they love and honor! How many young hearts go down in the light of day to lie in those glittering sepulchres—those charnel houses of the living, smoothly garnished over with the name of "marriages of convenience!"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A NEW ACTOR IN THE SCENE.</head>
                  <p>THE village of P—— was simply, so to speak, a dependency of the numerous elegant country seats of gentlemen, who each had erected along here a petty Versailles; so tradesmen and mechanics came and built this little hamlet in order to supply their wants. But as there were no other avenues of trade or business open, P—— was after all a very dull and insignificant place; and, as if expressly to suit the patrician tastes of its patrons, also exhibited no evidences of extraordinary growth or vulgar prosperity. <emph>The</emph> feature of P—— undoubtedly was its churches, which would lead one to believe almost, that the village tradesmen did not sand their sugar, or sell chickory with a cool face for the genuine Mocha berry. There were two of them (churches we mean) in P——, where the neighboring gentlemen and ladies worshipped in unexceptionable style and indifference. We mention these facts, because the occupants of both pulpits appear elsewhere some time in the course of the story.</p>
                  <p>The resident pastor of one of these churches was the Rev. David Dexter, a somewhat eccentric old bachelor, whose only aim in life seemed to be to preach the truth; and, secondly, to advance the interests of his nephew, whom we shall introduce presently. For himself he had no ambition; but this boy, the son of a long ago deceased sister, committed by her to his charge, filled his heart completely, and called forth all its benevolent and kindly sympathies. In his house the youth had been an inmate from his tender years, and Mr. Dexter had cared for him as his own. He had in his own study fitted him for college, and with his own slender means had maintained him, while he pursued in the halls of a venerable eastern institution a collegiate course of education. All this kindness and care was not thrown away upon Fred Stanton. He had just completed his college course, and came home to the little village of P——, bearing the second honor of his class. The uncle felt, as he gazed upon the manly form, intellectual countenance and generous bearing of the young graduate, that his seed was not sown upon barren soil.</p>
                  <p>During the four years of his collegiate course, Stanton had been home but very little. The vacations he had occupied mostly in study; so, when he finally forsook the halls of his <foreign xml:lang="LAT">alma mater,</foreign> and returned to his native village, there were many things with which he had to be made acquainted. Among his first inquiries, somewhat timidly ventured, was one after the young Maria Seeley, with whom before he left home he had had a boyish flirtation; and yet, he thought, it was not a flirtation merely. Though he never once, in all his absence, heard directly from her, yet he had cherished during the whole time towards<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5844-00000008"/> wards her a spark of some feeling, which now awoke into a lively desire to see her, and, if possible, to ascertain also whether the graceful girl, who had given him, as they rambled together by daylight, or sat by starlight together, only mute reasons to believe that he was beloved, even with the childish love of fourteen, still remembered him.</p>
                  <p>The next day after his return was the Sabbath. The morning service, as in duty bound, Stanton attended at his uncle's church—not without a little impatience, however, and a concealed desire to go in the other direction, where he felt tolerably sure he should find Maria. We suspect that he did not pay much attention during his uncle's rather lengthy sermon, to the logic of reasoning or truths of divinity which it contained. His thoughts wandered slightly to the pew in the other church, in which he imagined Maria to be seated; so in the afternoon his footsteps wandered in the same direction. He felt somewhat disappointed, however, in observing that Maria was not in her accustomed seat, nor, as far as he could perceive by stolen and side glances, in the church at all. The service over, he was moving thoughtfully away, when his eye caught the carriage of Mr. Laybach, who was about handing into it a young lady, whose face he could not see, but whose figure he thought could not be that of Maria. The lady turned her head at the moment, and her eye caught those of Stanton, who had involuntarily stopped and was gazing at her.</p>
                  <p>The recognition was mutual. Maria extended her hand with the cordiality of an old friend, and Stanton pressed it with equal warmth—warmly enough, in fact, to call upon her cheek the tell-tale blush, which she endeavored to hide from Mr. Laybach.</p>
                  <p>"You will visit me—<emph>us,</emph>" she substituted with a slightly-confused glance at Mr. Laybach. "You will visit us, of course, Mr. Stanton, if you have not quite banished us from your recollection in your long absence."</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me," returned Stanton, with a look which did not add to Maria's self-possession, "it would be quite impossible to forget Miss Seeley; and," he added, bowing to Mr. Laybach, and a smile mounting on his face, "though quite a boy when I was here before, I hope Mr. Laybach has not forgotten also the frequent honors he has done me."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laybach added his invitation to that of his adopted daughter, and the carriage drove off. Stanton pursued his way home now with feelings quite different from those which possessed him but a moment ago. This brief interview had afforded him infinite pleasure. It satisfied him in one respect, at least—Maria had not forgotten him, nor, the tell-tale blushes told him also, certain passages in their young life. He, of course, who knew nothing of what was taking place at the house of Mr. Laybach, attributed all her confusion to the unexpected pleasure of meeting him again, and her embarrassment to the presence of Mr. Laybach, which, he fondly believed, alone prevented her from giving him more unequivocal tokens of long-cherished attachment. Such ideas were not at all unpleasing, as may be supposed; on the contrary, Stanton anticipated with eager impatience the early visit which he promised himself he would pay Miss Seeley, and he slept that night indulging in the most pleasant dreams.</p>
                  <p>Poor Maria! She rode home from the church, her bosom filled with emotions very little like those ascribed to her by Stanton's hasty fancy. Undoubtedly, if we could have searched her heart closely, we should have found yet some lingering sentiment of regard for him, planted long ago in her youthful bosom, and starting up with the quick blush again at his call. But how could she who had resolved to bestow her heart and hand upon another, now harbor such thoughts? It was wrong to do so, she confessed to herself; and yet, in spite of all the chidings of reason, her truant imagination would wander still back to the times when that voice which she had to-day heard—though its tones were not then so rich and full as now—had uttered in her ear words which memory brought forward and repeated in the tones of to-day; words lightly spoken possibly, and perhaps at the time no more seriously regarded, yet which now mingled themselves, and taking no denial, among those which duty bade her entertain and regard.</p>
                  <p>However, she soon mastered these rebellious feelings. Worldly sentiments came to her aid; she reflected that even if Stanton were a declared lover, he was after all but a penniless youth, with yet not even a profession. He kept no carriage, and could not if he wished. He had in possession or expectancy no houses. Mr. Leavitt, on the contrary, was rich; and the brilliancy with which his fortune shone obscured very soon all thoughts of the young graduate.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Leavitt was, therefore, not compelled to sigh long unrewarded. The day following, when he called, he received the answer which we have seen Maria had determined to give; and, as Mr. Leavitt was impatient as a much younger lover, the earliest possible day for the celebration of the nuptials was urged, and assented to by Miss Seeley.</p>
                  <p>One day, not long after, Ellen Leavitt drove up to her brother's door on her return from a morning drive into the village of P——. Alighting and hastening into the house, she did not wait to lay aside her outdoor dress, but sought for Mark with an eagerness which promised some important communication. Finding him in the sitting-room alone, she threw herself into a seat with an air of considerable excitement and supreme vexation.</p>
                  <p>"What has put you into such a ruffle, my dear sister?" indifferently inquired Mark, languidly removing his feet from the window sill, in which ungainly position he had been sitting.</p>
                  <p>"You will take it less coolly when I tell you," replied she. "I am too much vexed to speak."</p>
                  <p>"Don't, then, by all means," he returned, in a provokingly careless tone. "I dislike <emph>scenes</emph> of all sorts in such enervating weather. You have torn a favorite dress, I suppose."</p>
                  <p>"Stupid!" exclaimed Ellen, with an impatient gesture. "But I will not get angry with you, too. I have enough to provoke me already. Uncle Jacob is going to marry Miss Seeley!"</p>
                  <p>Mark started from his indolent position.</p>
                  <p>"Impossible!" he exclaimed. "How have you heard it? It is nothing but gossip, though," he added, as if recollecting himself, and relapsing into his former state of indifference. "I have heard the same story a dozen times before."</p>
                  <p>"Read that, then, if you do not believe it," returned Ellen, throwing down before him an elegantly folded note, which read to the effect that Miss Seeley would be "at home" on Thursday evening, then a week.</p>
                  <p>"The old fool!" exclaimed Mark, crushing the note in his hands, and biting his lips in a rage. "Inveigled into marrying a baby! He ought to have a committee appointed over him, in order to preserve his person and property." And rising from his seat, he paced the carpet with compressed lips and impatient step.</p>
                  <p>"As to his property," said Ellen, "we can look forward to that no longer."</p>
                  <p>"No—yes," returned Mark, forcing the curt syllables through his clenched teeth. "The marriage shall never take place! I will prevent it!" he vehemently exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>"It is impossible," said Ellen. "The wedding dresses are nearly all made, and it is only a week to the time. What can you do?"</p>
                  <p>"I can do something, if old Brown has not lost his wits," replied Mark, forcing his voice down into a low but energetic tone. So saying, he left the room, with every emotion of anger and baffled avarice depicted on his countenance.</p>
                  <p>Ellen Leavitt was scarcely less violently disappointed than her brother by this event, which threatened to deprive them of an inheritance which they had enjoyed so long in prospect, that it seemed to them by this time as legally and rightfully their due. In the gay society which Ellen adorned by her accomplishments, fascinated by her manners, and delighted by her wit, it had been no inconsiderable attraction also to the eyes of the fashionable and marrying world, that beside her own respectable fortune, she had the near prospect of succeeding to one half of the splendid fortune of her uncle. Ellen had not been insensible of this fact, either. Thirsting for admiration and splendor, she would have consented to almost anything to secure these; and in turn, blindly worshipped that idol which is so exacting in everything from its devotees. In this respect, she had been gratified to an extent which would have contented a less grasping ambition. She had been surrounded by fortune hunting admirers; and managing mamas, who had aspiring sons, also fawned on her with their blandishments, meaning no more than the oily words of fashionable people usually do. All this was incense to the pride of Ellen, now threatened with such a heavy blow. No wonder that with her heart she hated Maria Seeley so strongly, and spoke so bitterly as she did afterwards of the contemplated marriage of her uncle.</p>
                  <p>Ellen remained sitting in her chair as Mark had left her, musing over many things. Soon her brother re-entered, prepared for going out. Informing her that he was going into the village, and would not probably return in some hours, he left the house and proceeded toward P——.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A COADJUTOR IN THE FIELD.</head>
                  <p>A VERY famous man, in his own conceit, was Mr. Brownly Brown, or Brownly Brown, Esq., as he loved to be designated on letter envelopes and so forth. Full of low cunning, and quite destitute of that troublesome thing called conscience, he prided himself upon his mastery of all that despicable trickery which, practised only by those miserable pettifoggers who hang like mercenary wreckers upon the borders of the legal profession, expose the whole guild to censure. These creatures are the Bedouins of honorable warfare, who follow the camp to plunder and outrage the dead.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Brownly Brown, or Brownly Brown, Esq., since the innocent suffix afforded him pleasure, had foisted himself, by a false oath, into a profession which his first act disgraced. His practice during the short time he was allowed to bear the honors won by such foul means, was of a piece with the manner of his acquisition of the right to use the title of attorney and counsellor at law. Never was a case committed to his charge known to be lost for the want of evidence—indeed, the manufacture of that necessary article was one of the most profitable branches of his practice—and the most exacting client could not complain of the never-failing skill and fidelity with which the delicate business was performed. If material fell short, why, for a proper <foreign xml:lang="LAT">quid pro quo,</foreign> Mr. Brown himself was quite ready to serve both as material and artificer, and gave equal satisfaction in either capacity.</p>
                  <p>Thus, for quite a length of time, Mr. Brown had been the most admirable of villains—a successful one. But alas! <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"The best laid schemes of men and mice</l>

                        </lg>
                     </q> and so finally it was with one of the schemes of Mr. Brownly Brown. In the pride and carelessness of his impunity on one unfortunate occasion, in which he indulged himself in the exercise of the fatal gift of seeing that which was not to be seen, and hearing that which no tongue had ever pronounced save his, he neglected to account fully for the supernatural manner in which he acquired the knowledge which he spoke so confidently on the witness stand. For this slip, his name was stricken off the roll of court, and he was sent to improve his morals by laboring a while in the service of the State. It was a heavy blow to Mr. Brownly Brown. However, <q>
                        <l>"Truth crushed to earth shall rise again,"</l>
                     </q> and, as a hateful parody runs, <q>
                        <l>"So will a toad."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. Brown rose. The comparison suits him, too, in more respects than one; for Mr. Brown's personal appearance would have reminded you sooner of that disgusting little animal than of anything human. The same obese ugliness of form; the same cold, slimy look and expressionless eyes, which glittered like the globules of ice formed upon the green pools where this animal enjoys its hateful existence. As a biped of this species, when compelled by outward danger, seeks for a while the oozy depths, but rises again soon to bask its green-eyed ugliness upon some slimy stone, so did Mr. Brown, after his brief estrangement, reappear in the village of P——, and opened again an office for the transaction of such business as he might obtain.</p>
                  <p>It was to Mr. Brown's office that Mark directed his steps. What he could have to do with such a character is, perhaps, none of our business. He entered, however, the dingy place, where he remained until the shades of evening covered his footsteps home.</p>
                  <p>When he returned, he retired immediately to his room, something to his sister's disappointment, who, though she had had that day ample opportunity of venting her spleen upon the contemplated marriage to several visitors, wished also to learn whether her brother, upon whom she depended, had been able to obtain any consolation from his visit to the village. The next day, when he adverted to the subject, though he refused to explain the object of his visit to old Brown's office, yet he spoke less fiercely about the affair than at first; and even urged upon Ellen the propriety of being prudent, at least in their bearing upon it. That day, too, and in general subsequently, when he had occasion to speak of the approaching wedding in quarters from which he was tolerably sure his remarks would be reported to his uncle, he exhibited the most commendable spirit, and said (though hypocritically enough, as may be supposed), that he was quite pleased at his uncle's choice, and hoped it would result happily; that he was glad at last to have an opportunity of showing those people (though he despised them) who took delight in saying that he and his sister entertained mercenary feelings towards their uncle, that they were entirely mistaken, and did himself and her equal injustice by the supposition. Few believed these disinterested expressions, of course; the less from the fact that Ellen, who in her brother's brief absence had not bridled her tongue, had vented several spiteful and severe remarks concerning the affair, some of which also reached the ear of Mr. Leavitt. Mark himself, however, took pains to see his uncle, and to express to him, in a manner so cordial as quite to disarm his relative's suspicions, his gratification at the approaching event, since his uncle's heart was set upon it. Indeed, he said, as he was rich enough already, he was glad that Mr. Leavitt had resolved to marry, since it would leave now no obstacle in the way of the most cordial understanding between uncle, niece and nephew. And Mr. Leavitt finally began to believe him, inasmuch as he saw no reason to doubt; and therefore gave his nephew and niece a much higher place in his estimation than he had done. All this, however, did not prevent Mark from having his own purposes, and following them out.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Leavitt was sitting in his study one afternoon a day or two after his interview with his nephew, when a note was handed to him. He opened and read:</p>

                              <p>"DEAR UNCLE:—I have to-day been made acquainted with a circumstance of a most singular and extraordinary character. As it immediately concerns yourself, and I am unable to see you personally, I deemed it proper to communicate the affair to you at the earliest possible moment.</p>
                              <p>"You are aware that it is given out and believed, that the parents of Miss Seeley are both dead. What was my surprise, therefore, to-day, when in the village, to hear that her father was there; or, at any rate, a character who claims to be her father, and who announces his intention to reclaim his daughter. The most painful circumstance about it, too, is that the individual in question is a miserable pot-house vagabond, whom you, no more than the rest of your family, would hardly like to become intimately connected with. I could scarcely believe that his claim was not a trumped-up one; but I must say, having been at the pains to see him, and to obtain a look at his documentary testimonials, that there is great plausibility, to say the least, in his pretensions. It is painful to suppose that Miss Seeley is the daughter of this man, as well as to imagine, if the fact is so, from what kind of life she has been taken.</p>
                              <p>"Trust me, my dear uncle, I am as deeply regretful of this most singular turn of affairs as you can be; but at the same time, if you desire it, I shall be glad to render you any service in endeavoring to clear up the mystery involved in it.

                  <p>Mr. Leavitt was thunderstruck. He re-read the paper, as if he could not believe his own eyes; then crushing it in his pocket, he hastily seized his hat and started from the house.</p>

                  <head type="sub">EFFECT IN ANOTHER QUARTER.</head>
                  <p>WHILE Mr. Leavitt was thus thrown into perplexity, young Stanton was also the victim of the most violent conflicting emotions. On the very next day after his brief interview with Maria—just, indeed, as he was about to start for the house of Mr. Laybach—the well authenticated rumor had reached his ear that Maria was to become the bride of the wealthy but advanced Mr. Jacob Leavitt.</p>
                  <p>"It is impossible!" exclaimed Stanton to himself.</p>
                  <p>There was, however, little room left him to doubt; his informant was not only confident, but positive.</p>
                  <p>The communication threw Stanton into a high fever of anxiety, of uncertainty, and heated emotion. The short interview, the few brief words, and the warm yet confused manner of Maria, on their meeting after so long separation, had revived in his breast all his former love for her, heightened and strengthened also by years into a more manly passion.</p>
                  <p>At any rate, he resolved he would not abandon, without an effort to realize them, the sudden hopes which he had formed. He would see her; he would know from her own lips the truth of the rumor, and his own fate.</p>
                  <p>Stanton followed up this resolution by immediately directing his steps towards Mr. Laybach's; but not finding Maria in the house, with the liberty of an old friend and a privileged person there, he sought her in the garden where she was walking.</p>
                  <p>The old flush came to her face as she perceived and came towards him, and extended her hand in the same manner she had used the day before. There was not, however, the same embarrassment visible; though there did appear a slight dash of restraint in her air, which seemed rather to hint distantly that the old relationship between them could not be again revived. Stanton could not help but notice this, and look upon it as an ominous token. Lovelier than ever, however, she appeared to him then; as, not being dressed to receive company, her shining hair fell somewhat negligently with the old luxuriant wave over her shoulders, and the heightened color obtained from out door exercises, brought again the bloom of years ago to Stanton's memory.</p>
                  <p>There were, of course, many things, after Stanton's long absence, of which they could converse without trenching upon ground which Maria seemed anxious to avoid, and used all her ingenuity to turn from.</p>
                  <p>"I am sure I shall never cease to regard you as a <emph>friend,</emph> Mr. Stanton" (she no longer called him Fred), said Maria, in answer to some remark of his.</p>
                  <p>"As a <emph>friend,</emph> only?" returned Stanton, a little reproachfully. "You do not choose to remember, then, that I once thought I had some reason to believe I might claim a higher title."</p>
                  <p>Maria averted her head to hide the emotions which expressed themselves in her face, but she did not answer.</p>
                  <p>"Maria!" exclaimed Stanton, with sudden impetuosity, drawing her to a garden seat, "you shall hear me!—you shall know how passionately I love you!" And in a voice rendered eloquent by the ardor of his feelings, he poured forth his love into the half-willing, half-reluctant ear of Maria. A tear gathered in her eye, which she brushed away from her averted face.</p>
                  <p>"You do not answer me," exclaimed Stanton, passionately seizing her hand. "One word, which you know how to speak, will make me happy. Say only that word, and I will bless you forever!"</p>
                  <p>"It cannot be," faintly exclaimed Maria, struggling to release her hand, which Stanton held with passionate energy.</p>
                  <p>"You have only to say it," returned Stanton, "and it <emph>shall</emph> be. Have I, then, been mistaken in supposing that my love was returned, at least in part?"</p>
                  <p>"My hand is another's," replied Maria, in a voice choking with emotion. "You have no right to hold it; I have no right to listen to you any longer, and I must not."</p>
                  <p>Stanton sunk back on the seat, pale with the sudden reflux of emotion. He pressed his hand upon his brow, at the same time voluntarily, though half-unconsciously, releasing from his grasp the fair, taper fingers of Maria. She rose to go.</p>
                  <p>"Stay!" he exclaimed, again seizing her by the hand, and detaining her. "You do not love this man to whom you are betrothed; your emotion tells me so. Revoke, then, the fatal words you have spoken, and we may yet be happy."</p>
                  <p>Maria had by this time regained somewhat her self-possession. She withdrew her hand from his grasp, and replied calmly, if not in an offended tone:</p>
                  <p>"I forgive you that supposition which accuses me of baseness. But if you would still remain a friend, you must address me no more in this language. I must leave you now; our long absence from the house will excite remark."</p>
                  <p>Stanton fell on his knees at her feet.</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me, if I have offended," he said. "But your words have made me miserable forever."</p>
                  <p>"I trust not," she replied; and forcing a smile, she added, "You will yet find one before whom you will forget all the vows you have made to-day."</p>
                  <p>"Never, never!" exclaimed he, vehemently.</p>
                  <p>Rising to his feet, Stanton accompanied Maria towards the house. Neither spoke; both were too full of conflicting thoughts for that. She gave him her hand in parting, and Stanton pressed it in mute agony. It would be hard to say, however, on which countenance appeared the deepest traces of suffering; but on Maria's was also a shade of severe resolve, as if she had determined to sacrifice her own feelings to some lofty purpose. Perhaps she imagined that it was a higher duty to keep the promise she had made; and so, no doubt, it was. But was her heart with it? Her whole demeanor in this interview had sufficiently answered this question; and Stanton rightly interpreted between her heart and vow. But, notwithstanding, he walked away to feel agonizingly his refusal where he felt himself still beloved; and she retired to her room, under the plea of a sudden slight indisposition, and did not again, appear that evening, but sat alone and mused painfully over the events, not of this day only.</p>

                  <head type="sub">AN UNHAPPY DILEMMA.</head>
                  <p>COULD Mr. Leavitt and Maria at the same moment have looked into each other's heart, and have witnessed the painful doubts which held possession of each, it is not hard to be believed, that neither would have felt greatly consoled in their own perplexity by that of the other; and without doubt, both would have deemed themselves justified in withdrawing from the position in which they had placed themselves. But they were blessed with no such insight; and neither confided to the other his or her peculiar anxiety.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Leavitt, in the state of wonderment and perplexity which Mark's note had thrown him into, hastened at once to see his nephew, without, however, having any definite idea of what he wished to do. He was somewhat sensitive upon the subject of family honor, or rather family name; and had believed himself compromising it quite enough by introducing into his house a bride who might be, in spite of her position in the house of Mr. Laybach, a wandering gipsy, for aught he knew. This blow terribly alarmed his pride; and for a time he quite forgot to reason upon the subject, and to reflect that the affair might have nothing in it after all.</p>
                  <p>This interview with Mark (who artfully continued to inflame his uncle's pride, at the same time professing the greatest solicitude that the pretended father of Miss Seeley might turn out to be an impostor), did not throw any new light upon the mystery, but only darkened it, as Mark evidently wished. Mr. Leavitt went home after a long conversation with his nephew, fully resolved to communicate at once to Mr. Laybach the whole of the circumstances of which he was possessed, and to Maria, also, his reasons for declining to fulfil the engagement he made. It was quite late when he reached his own house; but he determined to act in the promptest manner, and so sat down and wrote a note to the purport suggested.</p>
                  <p>He leaned back in his chair when he had finished it, leaving it open before him upon the desk. Then, for the first time, the employment of writing having cooled down his excitement somewhat, he began to reflect seriously upon the act which he was about to commit himself to. His affection for Maria, which was really an earnest sentiment, returned upon him; and in this train, also, all the comfort, if not happiness, which he had pictured to himself in the state which he had at last determined to enter, appeared as vividly as they could be supposed to appear to the imagination of a man of fifty.</p>
                  <p>After all, thought he, it is not certain that this pretender is the father of Miss Seeley. But there was no time for investigation, unless a delay lay could be obtained; and what reason could he offer for a request of that extraordinary character? None but the true one, certainly. Would not that, however, amount to an instant termination of his engagement, equally as well as the note he had already written? Most assuredly, it would; since it would accuse Maria of playing the part of an impostor, and Mr. Laybach, either of being deceived as well as himself, or an impostor also. Either horn of this dilemma was sufficiently unpleasant; and Mr. Leavitt retired to sleep, therefore, in as great a perplexity as ever, still leaving the note which he had written unfolded upon the desk.</p>
                  <p>What his dreams were, and whether or not any light came to him in the darkness to designate the path for him to pursue, we shall not say. But on the next morning he took his solitary breakfast, with only the housekeeper's sour face in view, and went to his study afterwards, and instead of folding or sending the note which he had written, crushed it in his hand and threw it into the grate. He sat down though, and wrote another, which, when finished, he despatched away by a servant whom he rang for.</p>
                  <p>"Take that to my nephew, directly," said he, and threw himself back again in his chair and mused.</p>
                  <p>In order to obtain a sight of this document, which it is necessary to understand, we must follow the messenger to the house of Mark, who received and read it at the breakfast table. It ran thus:</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE BRIDAL HOUR.</head>
                  <p>THE day fixed for the nuptials of Maria Seeley and Mr. Leavitt rapidly approached. It was, in fact, the eve before that day. All the occurrences calculated to interrupt the smooth flow and consummation of the bridal were wrapped in the secret breasts of the participants; and neither the kind protectors of Maria, nor the public, knew aught of Mr. Leavitt's perplexity, of Stanton's grief, or the conflicting emotions which filled the heart and brain of Maria. Yet they did not in consequence subside; nor did all her reasoning and dreams of wealth silence the whisperings of her conscience, which still hinted dumbly to her, that her heart went not with her hand, but wandered where, now and forever, it would sin in wandering. Even in dreams, the same monitor filled her brain with confused images, not such as one would conceive to occupy the imagination of one betrothed to be a bride to-morrow; and from troubled sleep she awoke late on the nuptial morning, to find the broad sunlight streaming in upon her couch, and kissing her fair cheeks with all the fervor of unlicensed passion.</p>
                  <p>Great preparations had been made to celebrate the wedding, since Mrs. Laybach was determined that a becoming splendor should illustrate the brilliancy of the match. Besides, she felt the interest of a mother in Maria.</p>
                  <p>The evening came at last, and with it the lights, the rector and the guests—first the few who were invited to witness the performance afterward the long row of carriages, with the other participants in the gayeties of the evening.</p>
                  <p>The bride, of course, looked lovely, as brides usually do, and the groom was dressed with usual elegance and precision.</p>
                  <p>We say the bride looked lovely, as brides usually do; yet beside Mr. Leavitt himself, who gazed with pride upon her, to one other person, whose face exhibited <emph>no</emph> pride, did Maria appear lovelier, far lovelier than ever before. That was Stanton, who would willingly have been absent from the spectacle so painful to him, but who stood by, his pale, intellectual face still paler than ever, gazing with mute anguish upon the loveliness which was not for him. Only once did Maria venture to cast a glance upon him, which glance he met with a look so full of suppressed pain and sorrow, if not a little of reproach, that she did not dare again encounter his gaze.</p>
                  <p>The bridesmaids, one of whom, Mary Lee, remembered her prediction some time ago, also supported their position with the usual propriety, and excited the usual amount of interest, as representing a fanciful medium between the bride and mere unmarried ladies, who had not even reached so near as that to the goal of matrimony. All was unexceptionable, as might be expected; and the parties stood up, and the rector read the service, and the wedding hymn seemed to be sung by an airy choir, in the silence disturbed only by his voice; while the gay pendants of the chandeliers glittered not more brightly than diamonds upon fair necks, and light glancing from flashing eyes.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly, however, a rough voice in altercation was heard in the hall, and footsteps which did not seem to come from feet fitted for the fine carpets and the festal occasion; and the door opened, and a rough figure entered, exclaiming, "I forbid the bans! She is my daughter."</p>
                  <p>The company stared in astonishment at this interruption, as may be supposed, and a ray of hope gleamed upon Stanton's face. The rector paused, and Maria fell fainting into the arms of one of her maids. For a moment no one stirred, or seemed to have ability to do so; and the intruder, whose features were coarse and rough, and whose dress was poor and ragged, staggered further into the room, almost against Ellen Leavitt, who screamed, and endeavored to escape into another quarter of the parlor.</p>
                  <p>The features of Mark exhibited as much surprise as any; but he was the first to recover (if he had lost) self-possession enough to usurp, in his zeal, the province of the master of the house.</p>
                  <p>"Who, and what are you?" exclaimed he, stepping up to the intruder in a threatening attitude.</p>
                  <p>"Why, you know, Mr. Leavitt," replied he, with a drunken leer and a wink at Mark, "you know I'm to play father of that 'ere gal who fainted 'cause she don't like my looks; I'm to stop somebody from marrying her, and to have a pile of rocks for it. It's all right," added he, laying his finger upon his nose with a mysterious, maudlin air, "It's all right; I'll earn my money, and you—" Here his speech was interrupted by Mr. Laybach, who seized hold of his shoulder, and threw him forcibly out of the room, and not stopping there, landed him out of the house, before he called a servant and ordered him to guard the door against any further interruption.</p>
                  <p>Mark was bursting with rage and mortification, but nevertheless met the suspicious looks which some of the company, and the fiery glance which his uncle bestowed upon him, with a haughty air, which he vainly endeavored to make appear unconscious.</p>
                  <p>Maria, who had now recovered from her swoon, pleaded to be released from the present performance of the ceremony; and the rector suggested a feeble doubt as to whether he ought to proceed.</p>
                  <p>"It is only a drunken wretch, who knows not what he is saying," energetically urged Mr. Laybach, in reply to the latter's objection. "I know his claim is false; Miss Seeley has no father living. It is folly to allow this intrusion to interrupt the ceremony." This was said rapidly, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce,</foreign> to the rector; then raising his voice, he apologized to his guests for the unseemly occurrence.</p>
                  <p>Something that Mr. Leavitt in the meanwhile urged upon Maria in a low tone, understood only by herself and Miss Lee, induced her, trembling and pale, to consent that the rite should be still proceeded with. Lovelier, and more interesting than ever, did she appear, as she stood up again, with the flush gone fromher cheek, and her lips trembling somewhat as she pronounced the indissoluble vows. Dimly over her heart at the moment, perhaps, passed a faint shadow, which seemed charged with the fate this ill omen seemed to point at. And during the whole evening, it overhung and clouded her happiness till the gay crowd were gone, and the glittering lights extinguished, and the heart of the young bride found relief in a flood of tears. They stained and tarnished the bridal laces as they fell, and made all the magnificence of the evening seem but a sad, unreal mockery, scoffing at her vows and jeering at her hopes. <q>

                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A CLOUDY HORIZON.</head>
                  <p>STANTON was one of the first of the guests at the wedding-party to leave the brilliant scene, which served only to render his own thoughts more miserable. But the look he gave Maria as he took his leave of her—<emph>that</emph> she remembered for years afterward.</p>
                  <p>It had been decided between Stanton and his uncle that he was to go to New York, there to enter upon the study of law; and, now that the neighborhood of P—— seemed, since the deathblow given to a fond hope, so insupportably dreary to him, he was anxious to go as soon as possible. Arrangements had already been made for the purpose, and Stanton did not long delay his departure. He entered as student in an office in Wall Street, and plunged again more deeply than ever into his studies, as if to bury there the memory of his griefs. It is idle to say that Maria's thoughts did not follow him occasionally.</p>
                  <p>Other things, however, soon occupied the attention of the young bride. She was now the mistress of a mansion, with the responsibilities which belonged to such a character. It did not take long to settle herself in the new residence which she came to, notwithstanding the bachelor habits which had surrounded it so long.</p>
                  <p>From his uncle's look on the occurrence of that interruption on the wedding-night, Mark anticipated a storm when he saw him; and went shortly after, not caring to avoid it, but only to turn its force, to see his uncle at his own house.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Leavitt was angry, as he expected. But when he discovered from his uncle's reproaches that it was merely because he thought his nephew had not taken pains to make such an interruption impossible, by following his desire and getting the pretender out of the way, and did not at all suspect that he had had any further part in the affair, Mark breathed much freer, and did not let his uncle's lecture discompose him a great deal.</p>
                  <p>"I did the best I could," replied he, when Mr. Leavitt finally paused for a moment.</p>
                  <p>"Was it the best you could do," returned the latter, vehemently, "to allow that vagabond to appear as he did, and announce to all the world that he was the father of my wife? It was doing nothing at all, in my estimation."</p>
                  <p>"How could I help it?" inquired Mark, calmly. "Could I prevent him from intoxicating himself upon the very money I gave him to induce him to make his way off?"</p>
                  <p>"You should have seen him off," returned Mr. Leavitt. "You should have seen him off, and, if necessary, gone with him so far that he could not have got back again in a day's journey. You should have placed him aboard of a Liverpool or Australian packet, at least, and been sure that he sailed, too. I expected nothing less."</p>
                  <p>"I confess," said Mark, in a tone much too humble to be unaffected, "I might have done so, if I had deemed it necessary, as I did not. But the affair will be forgotten soon."</p>
                  <p>"Forgotten!" exclaimed Mr. Leavitt. "It will be remembered as long as there are scandal lovers in the world. And <emph>my</emph> name to be the subject of their gossip—I have not the least patience to think of it!" added he, energetically pacing the room.</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry it has so happened," replied Mark, seriously enough. "But you will not be again troubled by the vagabond. I have not only sent him off as far as you can desire, but I also first obtained from him every particle of written evidence which he possessed, and burned it before his eyes."</p>
                  <p>A smile of half-concealed triumph and exultation came furtively upon Mark's face, as he said this. Mr. Leavitt, however, did not notice it.</p>
                  <p>"I am heartily glad you have done so much," returned he, in a much calmer manner.</p>
                  <p>"As for the rest," pursued Mark, "there is only the word of a drunken wretch, who could not even carry himself uprightly. What weight will that have beside Mr. Laybach's, or Mr. Leavitt's declarations?"</p>
                  <p>"It is true, it might be worse," said Mr. Leavitt. "And I don't know that I ought to complain of you. You have done me a great service by getting the wretch out of my sight at last. Accept my thanks; they are due to you, instead of reproaches."</p>
                  <p>And Mr. Leavitt, as Mark rose to go, cordially extended his hand to him, and begged him to forget any hard words he might have used. It suited Mark's purpose to do so, and to avoid any misunderstanding with his uncle; otherwise, perhaps, he would not have behaved so good-naturedly and forgivingly as he did. As it was, he accepted his uncle's reparation with excellent grace, and they parted apparently as good friends as ever.</p>
                  <p>But if any one had observed Mark after he had left the house, they would have seen upon his face the same smile of triumph and exultation, only not now concealed, which gleamed faintly upon it, while he was conversing with his uncle. He had some reason to triumph.</p>
                  <p>As for Maria, she knew nothing of all this, of course. Mr. Leavitt did not show her the note he had written upon the supposition that she would bring disgrace into his house. But she knew quite well, that the vagabond who had claimed to be her father was not such, and that his pretensions were trumped up. She did not believe that a person like the one in question would have alone originated the plot, and she knew of no one so likely to have aided him as Mark Leavitt. She disliked both him and his sister before the marriage; now she both disliked and dreaded them. However, since they were both her husband's near relatives, and only ones, she did not care to exhibit her sentiments to him, nor to refuse receiving them in her house with all attention.</p>
                  <p>Ellen Leavitt, and indeed Mark also (whether they understood this feeling on the part of Maria or not), were, notwithstanding, frequent visitors at her house; and Ellen, who could not hide her imperious and sarcastic disposition, and did not take pains to be tender where she hated, inflicted frequent wounds upon Maria's sensitive heart.</p>
                  <p>As time rolled on, indeed, in undisturbed connubial felicity, this became her chief source of unhappiness, since it made her unhappy even to dislike one whom she necessarily associated with; and she would have forgiven and loved Ellen, if Ellen would have consented to be forgiven and loved. But she herself never forgave Maria her marriage with Mr. Leavitt, and as that lasting impediment was always in the way, it was not likely that they would soon become friends.</p>
                  <p>If, otherwise, the omens upon the nuptial day had been unpropitious and predicted evil, they seemed to have already proved false. A year passed away, and the sky above the young bride's wedded life was still brighter even than upon the bridal morning. If, when she married, her heart had wandered, and she had for a moment forgot her gentle nature, and had been led away by false and cold glitter, her heart repaired, or endeavored soon to repair, its first error, and twined its affections about the man whom duty now bade her love. Her husband was all tenderness and kindness; and many already pointed at the happiness of the wedded pair, as a complete refutation of croaking prophecies, which doubted whether such a union could end peacefully. It is true, the end was not yet.</p>
                  <p>"Do you know, Mr. Leavitt, what event this day commemorates?" inquired Maria, with something of an arch smile on her face, one morning at the breakfast table.</p>
                  <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5844-00000014"/>
                  <p>"My dear," returned her husband, "I don't know that I do. Signing the Declaration of Independence, perhaps."</p>
                  <p>Maria burst into a musical laugh, which caused Mr. Leavitt to suspect that he had said something witty. But she composed her face again immediately, and affected a very little pout.</p>
                  <p>"You will forget that you have a wife soon," replied she. "It was not the signing of the Declaration of Independence, but something quite different. You forget the day of our wedding."</p>
                  <p>"True," returned Mr. Leavitt, "I did not think of that. But there is no need of looking back, my dear," he added, casting a glance of affection on his young wife; "every day now is a wedding day, and you are every day a bride."</p>
                  <p>"You are so kind, dear husband!" exclaimed Maria, springing from her seat, and clasping her white arms around his neck, she imprinted a loving kiss upon his lips.</p>
                  <p>At this moment the door bell rang, and in another in came Ellen Leavitt, habited like a Di Vernon, in a riding-dress and hat, and a whip in her hand.</p>
                  <p>"I have frightened all your servants out of their wits," exclaimed she, in a lively tone and a burst of laughter, as she entered. "They think that I am going to whip their master! I am not so bloodthirsty, however," she added, throwing down her whip. "I have been taking an early ride this morning, uncle Jacob, and have come to breakfast with you. I beg you not to think of ceremony."</p>
                  <p>"Certainly, Ellen, you are welcome, now that you have thrown your whip aside," said Mr. Leavitt. "With such an instrument, I should esteem you a dangerous character."</p>
                  <p>"O, I have as many characters as a cat has lives!" returned Ellen, gaily, seating herself at the table; "you have not seen me in half of them. But come," said she, in a playfully imperious tone, "you do not give me anything. Do you think I am a chameleon, also, and live on air?"</p>
                  <p>Ellen was evidently in high spirits, and rattled away without much regard to what she was saying.</p>
                  <p>"I assure you," she added, in completion of her last remark, "after such a ride as I have had, one cannot breakfast upon love, as you do."</p>
                  <p>She cast a half contemptuous look, as she said this, upon Maria, who felt a blush rising to her cheek beneath the haughty and cold eyes of Ellen. Mr. Leavitt did not, of course, notice this, which occurred with electric quickness.</p>
                  <p>"O, well," returned he, half laughingly, half apologetically, "you ought to remember, this is the anniversary of our wedding day. The truth is, though, I did not remember it myself, until Maria reminded me of it."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, <emph>Miss Seeley,</emph> I beg pardon, Mrs. Leavitt does not forget it," replied Ellen, in a tone, and with a look which made Maria feel certain that the former had intentionally mistaken her name. "One does not forget one's <emph>luckiest</emph> days," she added, a little sneeringly.</p>
                  <p>The blood mounted to Maria's face at this unmistakable innuendo, conveyed in such a tone as only Ellen Leavitt could command. But her spirit rose with her blushes, and she retorted as severely as she could.</p>
                  <p>"To be happy is not always to be <emph>lucky,</emph> as you term it. To be both, one would wish to choose, not only one, but <emph>all</emph> one's relations."</p>
                  <p>"No doubt," replied Ellen, affecting to misunderstand Maria's sarcasm, and misapplying her remark, "no doubt it is unpleasant to have one's relatives come uninvited to our wedding. We would choose to have them a little better dressed, and at least not <emph>drunk.</emph>" And Ellen accompanied this speech with the full glance of her haughty eye directed into Maria's own.</p>
                  <p>The hot blood rushed fiercely again to Maria's temples, and a tear of vexation and wounded feeling started to her eyes, in spite of all her attempts to repress it.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Leavitt," exclaimed she, rising from her seat, and turning her face from Ellen, "will you allow your wife to be insulted?—in your own house, too."</p>
                  <p>"Why, why," returned Mr. Leavitt, who had not seen, or comprehended more than half this scene, "what is the matter? Who has insulted you?"</p>
                  <p>"If you have not heard the insults offered me by your niece, I shall not repeat her remarks, nor stay any longer in the room with her," returned Maria, spiritedly, though it cost her a great effort to keep from bursting into tears. And so saying, she hastily moved to the door and closed it behind her.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Leavitt's eyes flashed, and his lips compressed, as he fixed his gaze upon Ellen, who sat indifferently striking her spoon against the edge of an egg cup. She turned her eyes full upon Mr. Leavitt, and met his stern glance with an impertinently cool and steady look, without changing a muscle, or quailing a particle before the storm she expected. Mr. Leavitt was almost confounded by her manner, and for a moment could not articulate a word.</p>
                  <p>"Why do you not begin to lecture me?" inquired Ellen, in the most provokingly careless and imperturbable tone, and not removing her eyes from her uncle's. "Your wife says I have insulted her."</p>
                  <p>"Well," exclaimed Mr. Leavitt at last, his pent-up anger finding vent, "you tell me this, and do not apologize! What excuse do you offer? Do you know that Mrs. Leavitt is <emph>mistress</emph> here, and that it is at her table you are sitting."</p>
                  <p>"I am quite aware of it," replied Ellen, calmly.</p>
                  <p>"You <emph>are</emph> aware of it?" returned Mr. Leavitt, nearly bursting with rage. "Well, if you were not a lady, I should know how to treat you," he exclaimed, stamping his foot and glancing significantly at the door. "You are my niece; but you forget it—you forget your duty, as well as the favors I have done you. You are an ungrateful, impertinent hussy!"</p>
                  <p>Ellen's eyes flashed at the word <emph>duty,</emph> and a sneer diffused itself momentarily over her face; otherwise she preserved the same calm, undisturbed demeanor, which contrasted strongly with the heated manner of her uncle.</p>
                  <p>"Now that you have condemned me," said she, calmly, at the end of her uncle's speech, "and that, too, without hearing a word, I have no wish to ask you to revoke your sentence; but I deny that I have <emph>insulted</emph> Mrs. Leavitt, by alluding to an incident which you know very well did occur. Can it be an insult to speak of her father as he appeared to me and to you, as well as to a whole company?"</p>
                  <p>"That vagabond was not her father!" replied Mr. Leavitt, severely.</p>
                  <p>"That is all well enough," said Ellen, coldly, "to deny the fact publicly; but there is no use in doing so to me, who know all about the affair as well as yourself. To tell the truth, though, everybody does; I overheard some of your particular friends, only the other day, talking and sneering about <emph>Miss Seeley's father.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Leavitt winced under this assertion—the idea wounded his vanity, or his pride. It humbled him also considerably, and he began to fear the consequences of this rupture with his niece, whose capacity for mischief he had some idea of. When he spoke again, therefore, after a considerable pause, it was with much less heat than he had previously exhibited.</p>
                  <p>"Even if what you say is true," said he, "it does not become you to throw out your ill-timed allusions in <emph>my</emph> house, and into my wife's face. No matter who was Miss Seeley's father, she is now <emph>my wife,</emph> and you touch me when you injure her."</p>
                  <p>Ellen saw the advantage she had gained; she resolved to make the most of it. Drawing herself up with all her natural dignity and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">hauteur,</foreign> she said:</p>
                  <p>"I am unconscious of having committed a fault. It will be sufficient, therefore, for me to wish you good morning." And so saying, she sailed from the room with the air of an offended princess, leaving her uncle in a state of anger, mortification and perplexity easy enough to be imagined. He went directly to the sitting-room, where Maria sat moodily gazing from a window, and threw himself into a seat with an air of vexation and discontent. He was in ill-humor at Ellen, with himself, and, of course, was not prepared to be in the most gracious mood to his young wife, who had only exhibited a proper spirit in her own defence.</p>
                  <p>"How could you be so imprudent, Maria," said he, peevishly, "as to provoke such a scene with my niece? There will be no end to the scandal that will come of it."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>I</emph> provoke it!" exclaimed Maria, turning towards him in astonishment at this new accusation.</p>
                  <p>"Certainly, somebody excited the quarrel. Ellen could not very well have got into it alone," replied he.</p>
                  <p>"She has insulted me a hundred times before. I have borne it till I could bear it no longer," returned Maria, vehemently.</p>
                  <p>"But it seems to me that there need not have been such a tragedy scene made over it, notwithstanding," still discontentedly said Mr. Leavitt.</p>
                  <p>Maria was wounded deeply by this tone of her husband, and his apparent want of sympathy with her sufferings from the systematic slights offered her by his niece. She had borne them far longer than any one else would have done whose spirit was not so gentle as hers; and now, when the last indignity was offered, and she was forced to resent the insults so often put upon her by word and look, to have her own husband censure her and side with his niece, was too much. Tears filled her eyes; she turned away her head to wipe them off, but she did not answer.</p>
                  <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5844-00000015"/>
                  <p>Mr. Leavitt rose with a movement of impatience and walked across the floor, but not towards his wife. The sight of her tears, instead of softening him and causing him to reflect upon his injustice, only closed his heart the more effectually against any sympathy with her distress.</p>
                  <p>"It really seems," he said, more ill-naturedly than ever, "that you can do nothing to-day but weep. I presume now, that <emph>I</emph> have said something to insult you! For fear of any more <emph>scenes,</emph> I will take myself off. Do get over this fret before dinner—I expect some guests."</p>
                  <p>And without casting another look at his weeping wife, he left the room with impatient steps. His conscience accused him a little as he did so, and suggested that he was not doing exactly right; but his ill-humor was aroused, and when one is angry, he does not listen to, but gets still more provoked at, the inward monitor which presumes to intrude upon him.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. Leavitt had gone, Maria gave way still more freely to her tears, which flowed unrestrainedly. This was the first time her husband had ever spoken a harsh word to her—this time, of all others, when she most looked for his sympathy and condolence. She had good reason to be offended at Ellen Leavitt; but now she had a greater grief, which quite swallowed up the other. To a heart like hers, as delicately constituted as the sensitive plant, a harsh word was felt more deeply than a blow would have been; and harsh words, too, from one we love, we all know how cruelly they fall into the heart which permits itself to lie unresistingly open to the mercy of its master, and does not hide and protect itself, as it attempts to do when strange hands place themselves upon it.</p>
                  <p>The first harsh word! How carefully should the fond wife and loving husband avoid this seed of unhappiness, from which often grow up such ugly and misshapen vines of ill, that twine themselves around the whole after life! It is the first thing which takes off the bloom of wedded happiness. It first teaches young love to doubt, to fear and tremble.</p>
                  <p>Maria sat for a long time in the same position in which her husband left her, bitterly, very bitterly musing over the events of the morning, which also taught her first the practical lesson that married life is not always covered by spring or summer skies. The anniversary of her wedding day, it was, too. Was not the conjunction ominous?</p>
                  <p>Mr. Leavitt and his young wife did not meet again till dinner-time, when several guests were present, and when, also, a very keen observer would have detected a little constraint in the manner of both. Mr. Leavitt was still angry, but endeavored to be, and of course succeeded in being perfectly polite; Maria still felt keenly, but endeavored to be cheerful, and to entertain her guests in the best possible manner. In this she also succeeded, since she never failed to please when she exerted herself. It is the advantage, too, of an artless nature and lively, cheerful disposition like hers, to please without much exertion, where mere art demands more labor.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE YOUNG STUDENT'S FORTUNES.</head>
                  <p>THE life of a student, like the history of a happy nation, does not offer generally many very striking points which the historian can seize. The wars and the triumphs of such a nation are wars with social ills, with the stubborn forests and soils; its triumphs are embodied in the steady prosperity and undisturbed peace which it enjoys. So with the student, whose battles are fought in an arena which admits of few or no witnesses; and whose loftiest victories over the profundities of thought do not receive the applause of admiring crowds.</p>
                  <p>Three years rolled on over the head of Stanton in the office where he was endeavoring to master the noble science whose history is adorned with the names of Bacon, Coke, Blackstone and a thousand others shining as bright as those. The history of one day in this period would pretty nearly be the history of it all. Hard and unremitted study, and the closest attention to all the mysteries of the profession he sought to attain, <choice>
                        <sic>eemed</sic>
                        <corr>seemed</corr>
                     </choice> to be his only thoughts. He visited P—— but seldom, and his visits, when they did occur, were of the briefest description. A few times, during the first year, he had also called at the house of Mr. Leavitt; but the sight of Maria's happiness only excited painful thoughts, and he finally absented himself entirely from her presence.</p>
                  <p>The necessary period of study having elapsed, Stanton presented himself as a candidate before the courts, and was admitted to the full honors and privileges of an officer thereof. This first step attained, he determined to allow himself a short period of relaxation by a visit home; and so, immediately after, he placed himself on board of a boat, which in a few hours landed him at P——. As he stepped across the plank upon the wharf, and stood for a moment looking around him, his eye caught the familiar figure of Old Sam, Mr. Leavitt's long tried and faithful servitor, standing near a coach; and in a moment more he saw also another familiar, well-remembered face gazing from the carriage window, and nodding to him smilingly. It was Maria Leavitt; but as he sprang to the side of the carriage, he rapidly asked himself the question, Can that pale, quiet face be that of the once light-hearted, careless and gay girl, whose bridal I witnessed three years ago? She answered the question herself, by saying to him, in tones of evident pleasure:</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Stanton, I am extremely happy to see you again—you have neglected us so long. You have just arrived? Well, you shall ride up to the village with me. What have you been doing, that you have not had leisure to remember your old friends?"</p>
                  <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5844-00000016"/>
                  <p>"O," returned Stanton, "I have been doing nothing that will excuse me. But pardon me, if I object to your supposition that I have <emph>forgotten,</emph> because I have seemed to. There are some things, in all lives, which we cannot forget, however much we may try."</p>
                  <p>Stanton involuntarily sighed as he said this, and Maria turned away her head, and looked out of the coach window. There was a momentary pause, when she resumed:</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Leavitt is at present from home; that is why I am here. I expected him by the same boat in which you came. He is on some disagreeable law business or other in the city. I think <emph>all</emph> business with you lawyers is disagreeable," she added, partly as if to explain her previous remark, and partly to turn the point of conversation.</p>
                  <p>Stanton laughed.</p>
                  <p>"And you would add, no doubt," said he, "all lawyers, too. Well, I confess," he added, "law and love are not convertible terms; one must learn out of Chitty how to make a declaration suitable for a lady's ear."</p>
                  <p>Maria smiled faintly, more out of politeness than anything else, evidently. There was an air of settled melancholy upon her face, which seemed to make such gallant trifling out of place. Stanton noticed it finally. Another pause ensued.</p>
                  <p>And during this pause Stanton's memory wandered back again to the moment when he had hoped to call the fair being before him <emph>his own;</emph> the feelings which he had succeeded in drowning, but had not extinguished, during his studies, swelled up again in his heart, and beat violently against his bosom. But he was conscious how hopeless were all thoughts of the kind; and as he had mastered them so many times before, he endeavored to do the same now, and imagined that he had succeeded, with far more difficulty than ever before, however, since he was in the very presence of the being whom he still loved above all others.</p>
                  <p>"I have been here so little, lately," remarked Stanton, after a moment, "that I am quite ignorant of the occurrences among my old friends. My good uncle does not write gossip in his letters."</p>
                  <p>"There have been none to interest you, I think," returned Maria.</p>
                  <p>"And yet your tone leads me to suppose that there <emph>has</emph> something happened which has affected <emph>you</emph>—which has changed you so much. Speak, Maria!" exclaimed Stanton, forgetting for a moment that it was not the young girl whom he had rambled and played with, before him, but the wife of another; and seizing her hand, and speaking with sudden vehemence: "You are unhappy—you are miserable! Tell me the cause, and I will avenge you against the world, even against—" He hesitated at the evident impropriety of the word he was about to pronounce.</p>
                  <p>Maria, also, who had only at first turned away her head and gently disengaged her hand, with a sigh which she could not repress, now turned her eyes coldly and reproachfully upon him, and said, in a calm, forbidding tone:</p>
                  <p>"You forget, Mr. Stanton, that I am the wife of Mr. Leavitt. I cannot listen to such language."</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me," said he, sinking back again into his seat, his face still agitated, however, by some powerful emotion. "It was my affection for you, which induced me to speak so—for these three years I have known no other thought. My heart is as much yours now, as it was then," he went on, speaking rapidly and passionately. "I have known no other hope than even yet to call you mine!"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Stanton!" exclaimed Maria, in a lofty and deeply offended tone. "How dare you address to me such words as these? Another of the kind, and I will order the carriage to stop instantly, and leave you alone, since you forget yourself and me so much."</p>
                  <p>"Pardon, pardon!" he begged, in a voice humble and supplicating, but choked and trembling. "I acknowledge that I have forgotten myself, and given you cause of offence. Forgive me. I was delirious for the moment; I knew not what I was saying."</p>
                  <p>"I forgive you," replied Maria, still coldly and loftily, "on condition that you do not again insult my ear with language which honor and duty, as well as inclination, equally forbid me to entertain. Another offence of the kind, and I will banish you forever from my sight."</p>
                  <p>"I will try not again to offend," returned Stanton, humbly. "I beg you not to dream of such a sentence; let me enjoy the misery which I feel in your presence more acutely even than in absence."</p>
                  <p>"You are hardly obeying my injunction, in saying so," replied Maria. "Remember, I will not listen to the slightest allusion to what has passed between us. Every thought of that I buried when I became the wife of another; and it cannot be revived without sin. Be certain that you understand me."</p>
                  <p>"I am forced to," groaned Stanton. "What a miserable being I have become!"</p>
                  <p>The carriage stopped at this moment, as Mrs. Leavitt had directed, at the house of Mr. Dexter, and Stanton alighted therefrom.</p>
                  <p>"Forget, forget!" said she, in reply to his last exclamation. "It is the only way." And saying which, the door closed upon her, and the carriage whirled away.</p>
                  <p>"Forget!" repeated Stanton to himself, as he turned to enter his uncle's house. "It is impossible!"</p>
                  <p>A sense of duty and propriety had enabled Maria to maintain her dignity, and to suppress her feelings during this scene. But when the carriage door closed upon her alone, and she was left only with her thoughts, she gave way to an uncontrollable burst of grief.</p>
                  <p>The reader is privileged, without offence, to repeat the question of Stanton—What has happened within these two years, which we have skipped over entirely, to efface the color from the cheek of the young wife, and to leave in its place the hue and expression of settled grief and melancholy? What is it which appears to gnaw so fiercely at the still young heart?</p>
                  <p>One would think it would have needed no extraneous elements of discord to produce, finally, unhappiness between two persons widely separated by the gulf of years, but still connected by the holiest of ties. Nature occasionally permits her laws to be violated with impunity, but not often, and pretty generally takes her revenge after a while. And as her high priest, Shakspeare, hath said, "Crabbed age and youth cannot live together," we are inclined also to believe that it is the goddess herself who speaks in the sentence, and pronounces her decree. <q>

                  <p>Therefore, when an old man marries a young wife, let him beware that she does not repeat to herself ere long these same lines.</p>
                  <p>However, Mr. Leavitt had nothing to complain of after he was married, except his own folly. If Maria had given him her hand, influenced more by the glitter of his wealth than by love, she had, as we have said, repaired that error as well as she could. But she could not change her nature, and grow to be fifty in a day. Therefore, she might have foreseen, and many did foresee, that <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>The first year was passed happily enough, as we have said. But the scene with Ellen Leavitt, which we described, was only the beginning of similar and other disturbances and unhappinesses from the same cause, which gradually estranged Mr. Leavitt's heart from his young bride. He could not at all appreciate her feelings towards Ellen, notwithstanding that the latter vexed him beyond measure also. But he grew cold gradually, since his first warmth was not natural; and without any other instigation than his own feelings, treated his young wife coldly and indifferently, and even cruelly—since it was cruelty to one like her not to love her, when he had first promised and then sworn to do so. Neither did the married pair ever recover from the misunderstanding first excited on that fatal morning by the sarcastic remark of Ellen Leavitt. It was that which destroyed the sweet illusion which hung over them; and it never was restored.</p>
                  <p>Maria, who was made to love, and could not forsake her nature, suffered—no one can tell how much—from this manner on the part of her husband. Yet the pale cheek, the quiet melancholy air, spoke eloquently, though mutely, of her sufferings and her heart-bleedings. Stanton encountered no difficulty, as we have seen, in reading the tale.</p>
                  <p>After the scene which had occurred, Stanton felt, also, some hesitation about exposing himself again to the influence which her presence exerted over him; at all other times master of himself, his experience led him to fear his own powers, when under the bewildering spell in which she involuntarily had bound him. However, one day, shortly after his arrival home, influenced possibly by a desire as well to see Maria, as to confirm his fears in regard to her wedded unhappiness, he directed his steps towards Mr. Leavitt's house. He had not proceeded far before he met Mr. Leavitt's servant, heretofore mentioned as "Old Sam." That was the name by which he was universally designated; a familiar patronymic which indicated in a degree the favor in which he was held, as well by his master and mistress, as by the visitors at their house, and<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5844-00000017"/> the villagers—in fact by everybody who ever had occasion, or made occasion, to have anything to do with, or say to him. He was a privileged character everywhere, and in Mr. Leavitt's household, indeed, occupied more the position of an old retainer or pensioner, than a servant.</p>
                  <p>Stanton stopped him with a friendly greeting.</p>
                  <p>"The world uses you well yet, I see, Sam," said he. "You are never out of humor, I believe."</p>
                  <p>A broad smile diffused itself all over Sam's coarse but goodnatured features.</p>
                  <p>"I'm an old hulk, you know, Mr. Stanton,"—old Sam had been a sailor, and spoke in nautical phrase—"I'm only fit to carry ballast now; as long as I get my junk, and can keep my <emph>pocket</emph>-pistol full," and he tapped significantly a side pocket from which peeped the end of a black bottle, "that's all old Sam wants. I oughtn't to say so, though," he added, a sobered expression suddenly taking the place upon his features of his accustomed goodnatured look, and his eye wandering off into the blue distance over the river, not as though he was gazing at anything however, but as though he was indulging in some sad and self-reproachful reminiscence. "I oughtn't to say so, I know."</p>
                  <p>"You ought not to think so much of <emph>that,</emph>" said Stanton, good-naturedly, touching the end of the black bottle in old Sam's coat. "It is giving you the <emph>blues.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"No, no, it aint that," returned old Sam soberly, but casting an affectionate look at the companion which had accompanied him in all weathers for so many years—"it aint <emph>that,</emph> that makes me feel so. That's the only thing that keeps my rigging square and head up to the wind. I couldn't sail at all without that."</p>
                  <p>"Why, Sam, I never saw or heard of your being in such a humor," replied Stanton. "You have lost some of your friends lately?"</p>
                  <p>"No, no," returned old Sam, his eye again seeking the blue distance over the river; "I hadn't any friends to lose, you know, that is, no <emph>relations,</emph>" added he. "I'm the only craft left of the whole squadron—and there were <emph>nine</emph> as prettily rigged and taut sailing vessels of 'em as ever bore up under a nor'easter. But they were all laid up in dry docks a long time ago. Beg pardon, Mr. Stanton," he added hastily, bringing his eyes back from their wandering search among the clouds. "You don't want to hear about old Sam's troubles—you have something better to do than to stand here listening to my talk."</p>
                  <p>"Not at all, Sam," replied Stanton, in quite a warm and kindly tone. "I want to hear what trouble you can have—I never dreamed before that you ever had any."</p>
                  <p>"Not for myself I don't," returned old Sam. "I'm on my last v'yage now, and the wind blows steady into port—my old timbers'll be laid up there 'fore long. But I want to see my young mistress happy—I haven't any business to speak of it though, I know."</p>
                  <p>"Your mistress! What of her?" exclaimed Stanton, somewhat eagerly.</p>
                  <p>"I shouldn't meddle, I know," old Sam continued, "but nobody thinks of stopping old Sam's mouth. I wouldn't say it to everybody, but you are an old friend of my mistress, I know, Mr. Stanton, and she thinks a great deal of you—I've heard her say as much."</p>
                  <p>The hot blood rushed to Stanton's face, but receded again in a moment and left it paler than before. But old Sam's eyes had returned to their fixed gaze over in the distance, and he did not notice this.</p>
                  <p>"I can't bear to see <emph>her</emph> unhappy," continued old Sam. "She is so kind, and so good, and so—so—" he sought vainly for a moment for another adjective to express the warmth of his feelings, "so like as if she loved everybody—that's it," he continued finally. "She aint too proud either, even to give the old tar a smile sometimes—her smiles go right through one so, too! I never felt so much like crying myself as I did this morning, to see the tears come in her blue eyes at something Mr. Leavitt said to her—I didn't hear what it was." And old Sam paused in his speech and drew his rough coat sleeve across his own eyes, still directed off in the distance. Perhaps even Stanton felt a moisture in his eyes also, but he made no demonstration, and continued silent, as if in a deep study.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Leavitt wouldn't treat her so, I know, if it wasn't for that land-pirate of a nephew he's got—Mark; Ellen aint any better either. Mr. Leavitt had a regular <emph>squall</emph> with her once; but it didn't last long—she acts just as if she was mistress in the house when she comes there, and Mrs. Leavitt can't help herself, 'cause Mr. Leavitt lets Ellen do just as she likes. Mark was there this morning along with Mr. Leavitt in his study, a long time. Split my eyes!" this was old Sam's favorite and most energetic asseveration—"I believe I should kind o' like to run a rope over the yard arm for that lubber, he acts so like a lubberly pirate towards my mistress."</p>
                  <p>Stanton was lost in thought, and did not reply to old Sam's observations, but let him run on though he did not lose a word of his narration.</p>
                  <p>"My good fellow," said he, finally, "I honor your devotion to your mistress; you are worth a thousand Mark Leavitts," and he seized and clasped heartily the hard hand of the old sailor-<unclear>servitor</unclear>. "I am as sorry as you are that things are so at your master's house. You have not done wrong in telling me, though I can do nothing."</p>
                  <p>"I don't know as I ought to have said anything about it," returned old Sam, his eyes moistening again at Stanton's sympathy and warmth. "But I never said anything to anybody else, and I know no harm will come of telling you."</p>
                  <p>"Never fear, my good fellow, I am glad of your confidence. Be as discreet as you have been, and no harm will be done. You can only serve your mistress as faithfully as you have done—you will be rewarded for it."</p>
                  <p>"O, as for that, one smile of hers is reward enough—I could do anything for her."</p>
                  <p>"Right! right! Sam," returned Stanton, strongly moved by this unaffected instance of devotion, which reminded him, almost—though but an old and battered sailor-servant was in question—of romaunts he had read in old illuminated volumes. He pressed again old Sam's large, rough-grained hand in his own white, study-attenuated fingers, and then started on.</p>
                  <p>The reflections excited in Stanton's mind, and the emotions aroused in his breast, by this interview, were of the most painful and absorbing character. Long cherished love revived, deep sympathy with Maria's unhappiness, and impatience at the hopelessness of his own position to manifest his feelings by any demonstrative way, each struggled, along with bitter and vain regrets, for the mastery of his heart. It was impossible for him, should he see Maria, even to seem to observe her misery which did not exceed his own—much less could he give any token of the sympathy, condolence and other feelings which strove in his breast to utter themselves aloud. His heart smote him even for the indiscretion he had been guilty of in his first interview with Maria, since he felt conscious that, with a sense of honor as fine as hers, instead of possibly affording her any consolation, it could only have served to place another thorn in her bleeding heart. He continued, therefore, on his way, resolved to see Maria again, and to evince by the constant respectfulness of his manner, his repentance for his previous fault, and his desire to atone as far as he could therefor.</p>
                  <p>He rang the bell at Mr. Leavitt's imposing mansion, and was ushered with a beating heart into the parlor. Maria met him with a quiet cordiality of demeanor, in which could be discovered no trace of unpleasant consciousness. She conversed quite freely, and with, once in a while, a gaiety which reminded Stanton of years agone. But it was only a fitful relapse from the unobtrusive melancholy which had settled over her countenance and movements, which had not the sprightly grace which Stanton remembered.</p>
                  <p>"You will make a little longer stay in P——, I hope, this time," she remarked, after a pause.</p>
                  <p>"I shall return to the city the day after tomorrow," replied Stanton.</p>
                  <p>"Indeed! You are hardly dutiful to leave home so soon, when you have been here scarcely a day at once in three years."</p>
                  <p>"It is not for me to dally," replied Stanton. "I have taken only the first step yet in life."</p>
                  <p>"True—and you wish, no doubt, to climb the others as fast as you can. All men are ambitious, I believe—it is well that the women are not," and Maria ventured a half suppressed sigh as he added, parenthetically, the last observation.</p>
                  <p>"All men are obliged to be ambitious or be nothing, all students at least," said Stanton.</p>
                  <p>"And of course, you mean to make the family name famous, to atone for there being so few members," suggested Maria, with a smile.</p>
                  <p>"I had one object once, now I have another," replied Stanton. "It is—but your supposition is as good as any."</p>
                  <p>"O, go on with your confessions—I will play the father-confessor, and listen to your sins also," said Maria.</p>
                  <p>"And pardon them?" inquired Stanton, with a sudden turn of his head.</p>
                  <p>"I shall not promise."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then I must defer it till another time; I have staid too long already," and he rose to go.</p>
                  <p>"You make such short stays, we ought to see you soon again," said Maria, cordially, as she accompanied him to the door.</p>
                  <p>She did not foresee the next occasion.</p>
                  <p>Stanton returned home in a more composed mood. Still he could not obey Maria's injunction, placed upon him as he left her carriage some days before—"Forget!" His heart refused. As he had promised, when the second morrow had dawned, he started again for the city.</p>

                  <head type="sub">DEATH SUMMONS—EVENTS FOLLOWING.</head>
                  <p>ALONG that busy mart of money, and grand foot-path of bankers, brokers, lawyers, lenders, borrowers and their clerks—Wall Street, Gotham, one who sought Stanton, after his return from home, would have found him, if he was not familiar with the place, after considerable trouble. Away up a narrow staircase, thickly lined with placards of all sorts, but mostly legal, to the left hand upon the third landing, he would finally find the door, with the newly painted letters, "F. Stanton, Attorney and Counsellor at Law." And if, after one had thus found the way, he could have gone on most any night, and looked in after the lights were out of all other offices, he would have seen the young attorney bending with eager enthusiasm over great volumes covered with law calf, and never once lifting his eyes to notice that any one had stolen in and was gazing at him. But one watching him thus, would also have fallen asleep in doing it, if he attempted to wait until the student did raise his eyes from the pages, and might have awakened again and heard the straggling noises of early carts in the streets before he closed the absorbing volume.</p>
                  <p>One day Stanton took from the post-office a letter which he instantly recognized by the handwriting and post-mark to be from his uncle, the Rev. Mr. Dexter. He opened it and read but a few lines, when the blood started to his temples in such a sudden rush that he dropped the letter, and almost fell into a chair.</p>
                  <p>"My God!" he exclaimed, "is it true!"</p>
                  <p>For a moment he was unable to proceed; then he again seized the missive with a trembling hand, while the blood alternately flushed his face and left it pale and blanched.</p>

                              <p>"DEAR NEPHEW,—I hasten to announce to you a painful event which occurred only this morning. Our esteemed neighbor, Mr. Jacob Leavitt, died this morning at nine o'clock. He was apparently in his usual health up to the moment when he was seized with a sudden fit, and expired before assistance could be rendered. The attack, his physicians say, was apoplexy, brought on, I regret to add, and say only confidentially to you, by a fit of passion with his young and interesting wife, thus rendered a widow.</p>
                              <p>"If your business will allow, it will be no more than appropriate for you to come and attend the funeral on the day after to-morrow, which I hope you will be able to do. The services are in my church.</p>

                                 <salute>"Affectionately yours,</salute>

                  </q>
                  <p>Stanton sat, when he had finished the perusal of the letter, for a long time lost in sober thought.</p>
                  <p>"So," mused he, "it is a fit ending. He who could get in a passion with one like her, deserves—" Here he checked himself. "A widow, and yet so young!" he continued. "<emph>She</emph> does not deserve—yes—no—she deserves everything that is good—may Heaven bless her."</p>
                  <p>The funeral solemnities took place as announced, in the church of the Rev. Mr. Dexter, and Stanton's uncle delivered the funeral discourse. Stanton himself was present, but during the whole ceremony he did not once see the face of the young and bereaved wife, who was dressed deeply in black, and kept her face closely covered with the flowing crape veil. After the funeral he paid her a brief visit of formal condolence and ceremony, and then he returned to the city as hastily as he came.</p>
                  <p>"Well!" eagerly exclaimed Ellen Leavitt, one day, a short time after her uncle's decease, as she encountered Mark on his way home from Mr. Leavitt's house. Her countenance and demeanor, as well as her words, exhibited her impatience to learn what information he had gained.</p>
                  <p>"There is no will," he simply replied, in a tone which indicated his own satisfaction at the news which he communicated.</p>
                  <p>Ellen's eyes also sparkled with pleasure.</p>
                  <p>"Maria will be entitled, then, only to a third," said she, in a half exulting, half inquiring tone.</p>
                  <p>"Not even that," coolly returned Mark. "Her settlement has provided for that."</p>
                  <p>"What settlement?"</p>
                  <p>"Made by the late Jacob Leavitt upon Maria Seeley before their marriage."</p>
                  <p>"How much does it give her?" eagerly inquired Ellen.</p>
                  <p>"Ten thousand dollars."</p>
                  <p>"It is enough for the designing upstart—more than she deserves," said Ellen, in a contemptuous, but exulting tone. "How much is the estate estimated to be worth?"</p>
                  <p>"About three hundred thousand," replied Mark, coolly.</p>
                  <p>"Magnificent!" exclaimed Ellen. "And all of it, except that miserable settlement, is—"</p>
                  <p>"Ours!" simply ejaculated Mark.</p>
                  <p>It was not strictly true, as Mark stated to his sister, that no will had been found among the papers of the deceased Mr. Leavitt, and yet his remark was true as a legal conclusion, and perhaps, after all, since it is the testator's <emph>last</emph> will which is alone entitled to be called so, it was true in other respects. Still, there was a paper found, purporting to be the last will and testament of Jacob Leavitt, in which instrument, after commending his soul to his Maker in a customary pious manner, he made comparatively trifling bequests to Mark and Ellen, other small ones also to his servants, among which Old Sam figured conspicuously, and leaving two or three quite munificent charitable legacies, he proceeded:</p>
                  <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Item—all the rest and residue of my estate, both real and personal, wheresoever situated, or in whatsoever shape invested, I give and bequeath to my beloved wife Maria, to be at her disposal and for her sole use and benefit forever."</p>
                  <p>But the instrument was neither witnessed nor signed. It bore date during the first year of Mr. Leavitt's married life; and had been made, evidently, when the current of his affections, "like to the Pontic sea," <emph>yet</emph> "knew no ebb." Alas! like other waters, they proved to be inconstant enough, after a time.</p>
                  <p>The paper had been carelessly thrown, after having been scribbled upon and soiled, into the bottom of Mr. Leavitt's desk, where it had remained, its author unconscious of its existence, a dumb but eloquent monument of the neglect which marked his conduct towards his young and gentle wife during the later years. It was good for nothing of course. Mark Leavitt was therefore right enough, for all his or Ellen's purposes, in saying that there was <emph>no will.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the nearest male relative, Mark undertook the care of Mr. Leavitt's papers, and locked them up and took possession of the keys, assuring Maria, with cool impudence, that it was his province and duty to do so, not only on account of his relationship to the deceased, but also because the latter had frequently declared that he intended his nephew to be one of his executors. He was also kindly officious in assuring Maria that he would relieve her of the onerous duty of administrating her deceased husband's estate, since, as he intimated as delicately as he could, her share was so very small, and that too, secured by settlement.</p>
                  <p>"Settlement!" echoed Maria, in astonishment—a little indignant, too, at Mark, who did not suffer any more time than he could help to elapse, before he approached her with the disagreeable topics of business.</p>
                  <p>"The settlement made upon you before marriage, by Mr. Leavitt, and signed by yourself," returned Mark, in a tone which he intended to be<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5844-00000019"/> simply suggestive and in aid of her memory; but which expressed something quite different to the ear of Maria.</p>
                  <p>"I never signed one," returned she, with no little warmth and excitement of manner, but in greater wonder than before, and hardly knowing what treachery to look for next.</p>
                  <p>"Certainly you must have forgotten it, no doubt," replied Mark, in an insinuating, plausible manner. "It is among your husband's papers," he added carelessly.</p>
                  <p>"A settlement—and signed by me!" repeated Maria.</p>
                  <p>"Undoubtedly,—I will show it to you if you do not yet recall the circumstance," said Mark.</p>
                  <p>"I <emph>know</emph> I never signed it—I do not wish to see it," returned Maria. "I do, too," she added, in a moment, retracting her words. "Oblige me by procuring it, if it is not too much trouble."</p>
                  <p>"I am happy to accommodate you," returned Mark, with great alacrity. "You will doubtless remember your signature, when it is shown you."</p>
                  <p>So saying he took his hat and left the house. In a few moments he returned, and immediately produced a paper, purporting to be what he asserted, signed by Jacob Leavitt and Maria. She did not read it, but merely glanced at the signature.</p>
                  <p>"It is not mine," she exclaimed in an instant, "it is a forgery!"</p>
                  <p>"O, well!" coolly replied Mark, "since you choose to deny your autograph, it is no matter to me. The instrument will of course be presented for legal proof."</p>
                  <p>"It can be proved only by perjury!" exclaimed Maria, with a vehemence almost unnatural in one who had borne so long and meekly all that Mark Leavitt and his sister had chosen to put upon her. She suspected instantly, though she had no idea what effect the instrument would have upon her claim to a share of her husband's property—which she now cared so little about that she would willingly have surrendered it all without a murmur, if it could have gone anywhere else except into the hands of Mark and Ellen—that they, or at least Mark, was not ignorant how this settlement, which of course she knew to be false, came into existence. She was surprised, naturally enough, at its production; but her surprise did not prevent her from being indignant also at the foul practices in which she knew it must have originated.</p>
                  <p>When Mark finally left her, therefore, to her great relief, she sat for a moment in thought, and then rang a bell and called for Old Sam, her most trusted servitor, who removed with her—as we have neglected to mention Maria had also done—to her old home, the house of Mr. Laybach. Old Sam was happy and proud to serve her—prouder still of the confidence she reposed in him, which repaid him for his devotion and loyalty.</p>
                  <p>"Sam," said she, as he entered with his sailor-like, awkward bow, and stood before her, his rough figure appearing still huger and more ungainly in contrast with the delicate, now almost ethereal form of his mistress. She spoke in those kind, musical tones, which fell on old Sam's ear, as upon others, with a magical spell, even though employed on the commonest subjects. "I have a mission for you to perform—can you travel? I want you to go immediately to the city and find Mr. Stanton—you know him; you can ascertain the situation of his office from the Rev. Mr. Dexter. I shall not write; you have merely to say that I wish to see him—<emph>on business,</emph> be careful to tell him that—and beg him to call upon me as soon as he can find it convenient. You understand?"</p>
                  <p>"Ay, ay," returned Sam, in his gruff voice—he had never left off his sailor habits of speech, and had never been deprived of its free use. "I should understand it and remember it, if it was as long as a towing line. I'll tell him every word, just as you say it."</p>
                  <p>Maria smiled, and dismissed him; and, after she had done so, still sat and mused until the twilight began to deepen the shadows upon her pale face.</p>
                  <p>"I am afraid," said Mrs. Laybach, entering the room, "that you are grieving too much, and keeping yourself too much alone. The dispensations of Providence, though sometimes severe, are always designed for the best; it is impious to mourn over them too deeply."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Laybach spoke in a kind and sympathetic tone.</p>
                  <p>"I scarcely have time to do so," returned Maria, with a sigh; "I am already pestered with business. That odious Mark Leavitt has held me for most of the afternoon, upon the disagreeable topic of settling my husband's estate. I heartily wish there was none to settle, if it would relieve me of him."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot understand your dislike of Mark. I have always thought him very much of a gentleman."</p>
                  <p>"As far as manners go, he is," replied Maria. "That is," she added, qualifying her remark, "as far as they are to be seen in public. If I were not compelled to meet him any more than you are, I should be satisfied, perhaps, to allow him all the accomplishments."</p>
                  <p>"Well, he and his sister are the only persons I ever heard you speak ill of,—I have no doubt you have good reason to do so, though I do not know them," said Mrs. Laybach. "But come, supper is waiting."</p>
                  <p>It was too late in the day, when old Sam's mission was entrusted to him by his mistress, for him to think of starting until the morrow. Nobody had yet conceived the idea of laying a railroad track along the banks of a river capable of carrying upon its bosom crafts of all sizes, with the commerce of the world beneath their decks. That was left to a later day, when no project is too extravagant to excite wonder, and when the world receives with the same undisturbed complaisance, Paine's or Ericsson's pretensions, as well as the gravest accounts of enterprising Frenchmen flying from the towers of Notre Dame; when, too, it is not ashamed to think quite seriously, that the fanciful dream of poor Poe, of balloons carrying to all points the pleasure-seekers as well as the commerce of the world, is "not all a dream," but the prophetic shadow of coming-events, which it shall witness ere long! No invention now is doomed to a sentence of insanity on account of the apparent wildness of the project, and even poor Gray, if he should now propose a railroad across the Atlantic, the track to be supported by balloons, would not be deemed so mad a man, as when, years ago, he first advanced the idea of supplanting the living by the iron horse.</p>
                  <p>And by the way, speaking parenthetically, before we go on, we wish to say that the above idea, of an Atlantic railroad, is secured by patent in the clerk's office.</p>
                  <p>By the morning boat, then, old Sam proceeded to the city, and readily found Stanton's office. The latter, as the messenger entered, did not at first notice him, so deeply was he involved in the contents of a volume which lay open before him. He hardly expected a client; long days and months he had already sat, almost in the same position, and no one had entered to disturb his studies, save perhaps his laundress, occasionally to receive her dues, or once in a while, also, a young friend who only came in to be social, and brought no welcome case to the hands of the young attorney.</p>
                  <p>Old Sam, however, did not long remain unnoticed. Stanton greeted him with cordiality, not unmixed with surprise; nor, either, it must be said, without also, an instant suspicion of the business on which he came. There is no harm in saying that, in fact Stanton had expected—quite confidently looked for, indeed—a message in some shape, to the effect of that which old Sam did not long delay the communication of. He was, therefore, not wholly unprepared for an immediate trip to P—, and told old Sam, in consequence, that he would follow him home the day after the morrow; or, if he chose to, and could wait, he should be happy to have his company on that day. Old Sam concluded, however, that he might be wanted at home, and indeed, did not care to remain away longer than he could help, and therefore told Stanton that he should return in the morning.</p>
                  <p>"Well, my good follow, I do not see—it is possible that I may go with you then. I don't think of anything at present," said Stanton, in a musing manner, "to prevent me from doing so."</p>
                  <p>The fact was, there <emph>was</emph> nothing to prevent him. But as the business was not urgent, for anything he knew, he did not wish to seem in too great haste, but rather to make a little hypocritical delay, in order to give out thereby that he was not so utterly destitute of business, and that this was not—as it was in fact—the very first that he had had to do. It was, perhaps, a pardonable vanity, or delicacy, which made him dislike to let Maria think that she, whom so many and somewhat awkward reminiscences connected with himself, was the first one who had confided to his hands a professional trust. The relation was decidedly a new one. His feelings may be understood, therefore, and excused.</p>
                  <p>Stanton's desire however, of having some little further conversation with old Sam, and the pleasure he took in hearing the retired sailor talk, as he did talk, of little else except his mistress, prevailed over other considerations. They entered the conveyance together.</p>
                  <p>Stanton did not converse, but allowed old Sam to ramble on as he chose. He was sure, in this way, to hear all he wished on the topic that pleased him most, without betraying anything which he might wish to hide.</p>
                  <p>"You ought to have seen," said the faithful servitor, continuing the gossip which we have not hitherto reported—he was speaking of course, of his mistress—"you ought to have seen how<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5844-00000020"/> she cried and took on, only quiet like, you know, <emph>like her</emph>—when the doctors said Mr. Leavitt was gone, and they couldn't save him. She wouldn't hardly let anybody else come near him; and when Ellen Leavitt came in and pretended to be crying too, and leaned over the bed to look at her uncle's face, it would have done you good to see how Mrs. Leavitt's eyes flashed—though the tears were in 'em—and how proudly like she took away Ellen's hand from the bed-clothes near Mr. Leavitt's face. You wouldn't have thought that Mr. Leavitt had fell into a fit and died when he was so angry with her that he could hardly speak—all for nothing, I know, too—and that the last words he said were so hard to her, that they brought the tears into her eyes. I believe she felt worse than if he had been always as kind as he was at first, and just like an angel—she <emph>is</emph> just like one, Mr. Stanton; she was sorry for him, because he died so, and didn't think about the hard words he had spoken to her.</p>
                  <p>"When I was a rough sailor, I'm rough enough though, now," continued old Sam, "I used to swear like a pirate, and say sometimes I didn't believe in a God or a heaven, like an infidel, but I believe now there must be one; I can't think such an angel as Mrs. Leavitt will go to the same place hereafter with Mark!"</p>
                  <p>Stanton listened thoughtfully during all this discourse, and smiled at the last illustration, though he could not help being affected. Old Sam went on.</p>
                  <p>"I've heard say there aint any will, and I guess there aint," said he, "but it's just as well. Mark and Ellen would have got all the property, if Mr. Leavitt had made one. I know something about another paper though, but I aint sure that anything's going to be done with it."</p>
                  <p>Stanton heard this remark, but occupied as he was by other thoughts which ran in the train of Sam's previous talk, did not heed it particularly, or make the inquiry which it would naturally suggest. He continued silent, preferring to let Sam run on.</p>
                  <p>"I suppose you don't know, Mr. Stanton, that we aint at the old place, now?"</p>
                  <p>"No! where then?"</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Leavitt said she couldn't bear to stay there; besides, Mark came there so often, as if he had a right to, that she said she hoped to get rid of him by going back to her father's."</p>
                  <p>"Her father's?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Laybach's, you know; she calls him father, and he is just the same as one. But if she wanted to be rid of Mark, it hasn't done any good; he comes there as much at he did before, and was there all the afternoon, the day before I started after you. She don't like business much, and acts just as if she didn't care a bit about money or anything of that sort."</p>
                  <p>The boat soon arrived at the wharf frequented by the villagers of P——. Mr. Laybach's carriage was there, as if expecting Stanton, but he declined to go immediately to his house, saying that he would go to his uncle's, and call upon Mrs. Leavitt in the morning.</p>

                  <head type="sub">PROGRESS OF THE BUSINESS.</head>
                  <p>SOME months had now passed over the head of Maria since the death of her husband. Not only custom, but her own feelings, still rendered the weeds she wore peculiarly appropriate. So young a bride—so young a widow! The few, but <emph>not</emph> short, years of her married life had taught her most momentous lessons. She had "suffered a soul change." From the thoughtless and gay girl of eighteen—who had permitted her lively imagination to be carried away by the brilliancy of a match which wealth alone had rendered brilliant, while, if she consulted her heart at all, it was but momently, and only thoughtlessly, to disregard its monitions—she had become, in a widow of but little more than twenty-one, a quiet, thoughtful woman, whose full countenance was still more beautiful than ever, from the gentle melancholy which had spread itself over it, and manifested itself in each subdued tone and motion.</p>
                  <p>Somehow or other—"how or why, we know not," says Edgar A. Poe, "this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the higher manifestations of true beauty." And though he was not speaking of female, but poetic, beauty, yet "Leonore," "Annabel Lee," and, indeed, nearly every one of his female characters, show clearly enough that he entertained the same ideas with reference to that subject, and perhaps meant to include it in the other. Louis XIV., however, would not have fallen in love with "Annabel Lee"—it is a difference in taste. There was little taint of sadness in Maintenon and Pompadour, or Nellie Georgienne; and we know well enough what kind of sentiments reigned in the Trianon. This proves nothing, however, except that libertines admire one description of charms, and poets love another. Poe would have held his head as high as Louis, and would not have fallen in love either, with "Scarron's widow."</p>
                  <p>Bitterly had Maria learned to regret her first serious error. She had entered into an unnatural union out of pure worldly considerations; so nature came presently and avenged herself. We will not dwell, however, on a subject as painful to her as to us. We will add, simply, that not-withstanding the ill-treatment which she received at the hands of her husband, she had even learned to love him (as if in order to subject her heart to still severer punishment), and mourned for him, now that he was gone, with true sorrow, forgetting her other griefs. But her sorrow was not obtrusive. It rather exhibited<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5844-00000021"/> ed itself, if we may so express ourselves, in radiation.</p>
                  <p>Maria expected Stanton, on the morning after his arrival at P——, with considerable impatience. She was simply anxious to be rid of the business which Mark forced her to listen to. Therefore, early in the day, she heard the doorbell ring with pleasure, and met Stanton, a moment after in the parlor, with a quiet smile and cordial greeting. Stanton was at first a little embarrassed, from considerations already mentioned. His heart bounded to his throat, too, as he took the hand which he had taken under so many strangely contrasted circumstances.</p>
                  <p>After a few moments' conversation, she adverted to the object which had impelled her to send for him, stated to him that she wished to entrust the whole business to his hands, and related the circumstances of Mark's disclosure, a few days before, of a marriage settlement, which she had never seen or heard of until then.</p>
                  <p>"You did not sign it?" inquired Stanton.</p>
                  <p>"No; there never was such a thing spoken of before my marriage."</p>
                  <p>"It is good for nothing, then."</p>
                  <p>"It is signed though, and with my name."</p>
                  <p>"A forgery?" exclaimed Stanton, in a surprised, but inquiring tone.</p>
                  <p>"Without doubt," returned Maria.</p>
                  <p>"Who could have been guilty—"</p>
                  <p>The last word was not out of Stanton's mouth, when the door opened, and Mark Leavitt entered the room. They had been so much engaged in conversation, that neither had heard the ringing of the bell, nor indeed anything, until Mark stood before them.</p>
                  <p>Stanton checked the words he was pronouncing, and cast a significant, inquiring glance at Maria. She answered by one as full of meaning.</p>
                  <p>"I neglected some things, Mrs. Leavitt," began Mark, "in our conversation the other day, which I thought it would be proper to trouble you with. I—"</p>
                  <p>"I have no doubt," interrupted Maria, "that Mr. Stanton will answer you as well, if not better, than I can. I have committed everything to him."</p>
                  <p>She spoke in a tone intentionally formal, as if to forbid his further procedure. She added, as if to leave no possible room for him to mistake her meaning:</p>
                  <p>"I shall be obliged, if you will communicate everything which relates to <emph>business</emph> to him."</p>
                  <p>Mark bowed, and glanced at Stanton.</p>
                  <p>"You will find me any time at home. I shall be happy to see you," said the latter, politely, but distantly.</p>
                  <p>"I shall do myself the honor of calling," returned Mark, and immediately retired.</p>
                  <p>Stanton resumed the conversation where it had been interrupted.</p>
                  <p>"You suspect him?"</p>
                  <p>"I cannot help it."</p>
                  <p>"It is hardly possible your suspicions can be correct. What motive?" Stanton asked this question, half musingly to himself, half inquiringly of Maria.</p>
                  <p>"He needs none," replied she.</p>
                  <p>"One does not subject himself to State's prison punishment for nothing," replied Stanton. "What is the amount of the settlement?"</p>
                  <p>"I did not look."</p>
                  <p>"Without doubt, then, it is small, and the object has been pecuniary. Can it be possible?"</p>
                  <p>"I fear so."</p>
                  <p>"It must be speedily looked into." And so saying, Stanton rose to go. Maria rose also.</p>
                  <p>"You must talk to me on <emph>business</emph> absolutely as little as possible, Mr. Stanton. I detest the topic," said she, with as much gayety in her tones, as she had exhibited for a long time.</p>
                  <p>Some old thoughts stirred themselves up in Stanton's breast, and a sudden light gleamed in his eye.</p>
                  <p>"You will not permit me to say anything else; there is only one other subject on which I can talk to <emph>you.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Not that, not that," replied Maria, with a gentle shake of the head, and a reproving look. "It is a poor gallant who can talk to a lady only on one subject," she added, smiling again, with even a slightly arch expression, as if she were afraid Stanton would take as a sarcasm, what she only meant as an inducement for him to take up a lighter strain. He comprehended her, but he could not shake off the mood which he had prevented himself from falling into until the very moment of taking his departure. He did not, therefore, remain longer, but muttered to himself, as he walked down the avenue:</p>
                  <p>"She is an angel, but she is also a sphinx!"</p>
                  <p>His thoughts ran in this channel for a time, when it reverted to the subject of the extraordinary nary information he had gained relative to the existence of a marriage settlement which must have been fabricated. Suddenly he recalled the half-heeded remark of Old Sam, concerning his knowledge of a certain paper, the character of which he had not then thought worth inquiring into, but which, it now suggested itself to him, might be the very one in question. He was about turning back, but on second thought, concluded to make this the excuse of another call on the next day.</p>
                  <p>As he was about starting, however, when that time arrived, Mark Leavitt was announced. Stanton received him with suavity, and, as he imagined, of course, that his call was on business, immediately conducted him into Mr. Dexter's study. Mark did not open the subject directly, however, but talked on general topics with considerable vivacity, and engaged Stanton before long in quite an animated discussion, in which the latter quite forgot the affair which had brought him to P——. Mark closed it finally, by rising and saying, in a cordial, familiar tone:</p>
                  <p>"Well, Stanton, I hope you will not neglect us, as you have done in your previous visits home. I should be most happy to see you at our house. By the way," he added, looking at his watch, "dine with me to-day. I have a little business in the village; I will call for you when I have despatched it. Don't refuse me," he urged, as Stanton hesitated, and seemed about to frame an excuse.</p>
                  <p>"Really, my business—"</p>
                  <p>"O, that can wait," interrupted Mark. "A few hours will make no difference; my sister expects you, so you cannot refuse gracefully."</p>
                  <p>Stanton still hesitated a moment; but concluding finally, that there could be no harm done in accepting the invitation, signified his assent.</p>
                  <p>"I will call for you in an hour," said Mark, looking at his watch.</p>
                  <p>At the appointed time the carriage drove up, and Stanton was soon whirled along after a pair of noble bays up the gravelled and winding avenue which led to the house in which Mark and his sister resided. Mark chatted away in the liveliest manner, as if there were no thought of any other business, of his arrangements around the house, improvements intended, etc.; and Stanton, since he was a guest, entered into his humor, and said nothing to bring up the subject of the late Mr. Leavitt's estate.</p>
                  <p>Ellen met Stanton in the drawing-room with marked <foreign xml:lang="FRA">empressement.</foreign> She remembered him, she said, as a very old friend, though he had neglected them very long indeed. She made him, therefore, take a seat near her, and began to chat in her most vivacious and entertaining manner, in which Stanton did not long allow himself to be outdone.</p>
                  <p>The fact was, that Stanton had never been intimate with either Mark or Ellen; the latter indeed he had met scarcely a half dozen times in his life, and even then at a period when he had no eye for any one except Maria. And though years had not been able to extinguish the old flame which still burned in his breast, yet it had become so much like a hopeless, never to-be-gratified passion—a fire, the embers of which smouldered, and only were occasionally stirred up—that it did not, as it once did, as well in the absence as in the presence of its object, occupy his heart so completely. He was forced to acknowledge, therefore, after a protracted conversation with Ellen, that she was a very fascinating creature. He never dreamed that she possessed such powers of imagination and wit; and his heart, which had been held by the gentle graces of Maria's character in strong, pure devotion to her, before an hour had passed swiftly away, was already half enslaved by the daring fascinations of Ellen's wit and manner.</p>
                  <p>Ellen was, in fact, not so beautiful as she was commanding; her eyes was the feature which drew attention from all others, and they were haughty, scornful, and cold as stone, or liquid and bewitchingly fascinating, as she chose. She was now a very little <foreign xml:lang="FRA">passee</foreign> in years; but she still reigned with undisputed sway in society, and still made innumerable conquests, which she despised after she had accomplished them.</p>
                  <p>The time before dinner passed rapidly. Stanton found himself giving Ellen his arm to conduct her to the table, with a manner which makes us tremble for the other love which has existed so long but so hopelessly.</p>
                  <p>After the dinner was over, Mark invited Stanton to his study (as we will call it, since everybody has one), excusing him to Ellen, by saying that they had some business to transact.</p>
                  <p>"We might as well," said Mark, as they found themselves alone in the apartment we have designated, "since you regard your time, enter<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5844-00000022"/> at once upon an understanding in regard to this business which you have in hand. I have offered to take administration upon myself. What does Mrs. Leavitt say to the proposal?"</p>
                  <p>"She does not wish to trouble you; she will apply for it herself."</p>
                  <p>"Very well," replied Mark, drily. "I made the offer merely to relieve her from a disagreeable business; it does not matter to me. You wish, then, to receive certain papers of my late uncle?"</p>
                  <p>Stanton assented. Mark went to a drawer, from which he took a bunch of keys, and handed them to Stanton.</p>
                  <p>"They put you in possession of all, except," said Mark, taking out also a folded paper, "this, which I have taken out at the desire of Mrs. Leavitt, who wished to see it, and have neglected to return to its place. It is the settlement of which she has, no doubt, informed you."</p>
                  <p>As he spoke, he handed the paper to Stanton, who glanced over its contents. Mark remained silent until the former had finished its perusal (pausing, as he did so, to notice the strange peculiarity that the signature to the document was not that of Maria Seeley, but of Maria <emph>Leavitt</emph>), when Mark, who had carefully watched Stanton's countenance during the time, extended his hand a little nervously again to take the paper. He resumed:</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Leavitt denies that the signature is hers; she has undoubtedly forgotten it. Well, my sister and myself are alone injured by its destruction. It shall be the cause of no trouble between us; I am rich enough—thus I dispose of it!"</p>
                  <p>So saying, before Stanton could utter a word, he rapidly tore the paper into bits, and threw it into the grate, retaining in his fingers, however, as if accidentally, a little slip on which the signatures were written.</p>
                  <p>"You have no right!" exclaimed Stanton, a look of mortification passing over his countenance.</p>
                  <p>"It is done!" returned Mark, twisting the slip which remained in his hand. "I am the only sufferer. Mrs. Leavitt cannot complain at receiving ten times more than she otherwise would."</p>
                  <p>"She wishes no more than her due."</p>
                  <p>"Well, her due is now what the law allows her. Is it not satisfactory?"</p>
                  <p>Satisfactory or not, Stanton saw that what had been done could not be remedied, though he was not more than half pleased at this unexpected simplification of his duties. He left soon after, not without cordial and pressing invitations from both Mark and his sister to visit them as often as possible during his stay at P——. Suspicion of Mark struggled with admiration for Ellen—the latter prevailed. He promised to do so. What is more, he intended to, and did keep his promise.</p>
                  <p>From that day forward, Stanton was a frequent visitor at the house of Mark; attracted by Ellen's fascinations, he became the constant companion of her walks and drives. The star which had hitherto guided his existence, began sensibly to wane.</p>
                  <p>Maria was fully conscious of all this. Stanton now seldom called on her, except on the business which was not now exceedingly onerous. She noticed, also, a kind of embarrassment or uneasiness in his manner, when conversing with her; and with a woman's quick eye, she detected his secret, while he hardly yet knew it himself. But it did not change her manner towards him. She greeted him when he came, with the same quiet smile, and spoke to him in the same musical though a little sadly subdued tones, which once had such wild fascinations for him.</p>
                  <p>It is true that Stanton felt occasionally, when in the presence of Maria, the old feelings struggling with the new for the empire of his breast. They gained it, too, sometimes, when he would seem about to throw himself at her feet, confess his treason, and beseech her to take pity on him; but then the words, "Forget, forget!" which she seemed forever silently to repeat, forbade him to do so, but left him to struggle alone. Ellen's fascinations, exerted almost daily upon him, were too strong for a passion which received no more encouragement than did his for Maria. He became blindly, madly in love, and worshipped the new idol as passionately as he had done the old.</p>
                  <p>The matter which Stanton had in hand occupying so long, and other business also seeking his hands, he determined finally to remove his office to P——; influenced, very likely, also, by considerations which only need be hinted at. He was still ardently devoted to his profession, and looked forward with eager ambition to its highest honors.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after he had settled at P——, a cause of more than usual importance came to his hands. It was one in which a large amount of property was involved, but not one of remarkably popular interest. He was employed with another and more experienced member of the profession to conduct the cause of the plaintiff in the suit. On the day for trial, his associate was ill, and he was obliged to manage the cause alone. He did it with so much skill, his summing up exhibited such a mastery of abstruse and profound law, that the bench and bar were equally astonished at his learning, and the ability which he displayed in arraying it, in such a severe and logical manner, forced conviction upon the gray-headed judges.</p>
                  <p>"That young man," said one of them to a friend, as he descended from the bench, on the conclusion of the argument, "that young man is preparing to take my seat."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE DRIVE—A NEW TRIAL.</head>
                  <p>AFTER the apparently strong disinterestedness which Mark had given by the destruction of the disputed paper, Maria could not any longer entertain her suspicions, especially as Stanton did not confirm them. For some reason, or possibly through neglect, he did not mention to her the circumstance of the incongruous subscription to the document. The business of settling the estate went smoothly on.</p>
                  <p>Mark began after a time to resume his visits to the house of Mr. Laybach, and seemed to seek the presence of Maria on every occasion. She noticed, also, a distinguished change in his manner towards her; from the deliberately slighting demeanor which he had exhibited heretofore, he became obsequious, attentive and apparently anxious to please. He was, in fact, so constantly with her, that it began to be remarked and wondered at.</p>
                  <p>Was it possible that Maria's sentiments had also changed with Mark's demeanor? No; she detested him—and the more because she believed (for what object she knew not) that his present conduct was as hypocritical as it had before been insulting.</p>
                  <p>One peculiarly bright and beautiful day, she was standing by a window of the sitting-room, gazing out upon the lovely landscape, while Mrs. Laybach sat quietly absorbed in the contents of a volume.</p>
                  <p>"How charming the air must be to-day," exclaimed Maria, with more animation than was usual for her. "I long for a drive. It is really too bad to be confined to the house."</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry you cannot, since you wish it," said Mrs. Laybach, raising her eyes from her book. "It would benefit you, I have no doubt. But you know Mr. Laybach has gone away with the carriage and horses."</p>
                  <p>"I know it; I wish some of my good friends would take pity on me," replied Maria, still gazing out of the window. "I declare, there is somebody's carriage coming now. I shall certainly invite myself to a drive."</p>
                  <p>The carriage drove up in a moment.</p>
                  <p>"It is Mark Leavitt!" exclaimed Maria, with a movement of vexation and disappointment. "Am I to be pestered again to-day with him?"</p>
                  <p>A servant came to inform her that Mr. Leavitt requested to see her. She went into the parlor, but returned in a few moments.</p>
                  <p>"He has invited me to take a drive," she exclaimed, with a dissatisfied expression, as she entered again the apartment where Mrs. Laybach was, "and I have consented. I wish I could retreat."</p>
                  <p>"There can be no harm in going with your nephew, I am sure," returned Mrs. Laybach.</p>
                  <p>"My nephew!"</p>
                  <p>"Your husband's nephew—is it not the same thing?"</p>
                  <p>"That isn't the question. I dislike him; I can't bear his company."</p>
                  <p>"It is your own fault, then. Why did you give your consent?"</p>
                  <p>"Because I was insane, I think," returned Maria.</p>
                  <p>However, now, there was no help; she had accepted Mark's invitation, and she could make no excuse. He was unusually officious in waiting upon her into the carriage, which in a few minutes drove off. They went along rapidly for some distance, when the horses were allowed to relax their pace.</p>
                  <p>Maria could not bring herself to converse freely, though she endeavored to; but Mark talked quite gaily for a time. A pause finally ensued, which he broke.</p>
                  <p>"Maria!" he exclaimed, in a tone and with a look which startled her, though it was evidently intended to express the deepest feelings. He had never before ventured, either, to address her by her first name, and she did not wish to encourage any familiarity.</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Leavitt, if you please," replied she, coldly.</p>
                  <p>"You kill me by this cruelty," returned he, rapidly and passionately. "Will you not permit me to call you by a name which is dearer to me than any other?—I, who love you with all my soul? Ay, I love you, Maria! Nay, listen! I love you purely and devotedly. Consent to say that you will be my wife!" He spoke in the tone of passionate entreaty, making a motion to take her hand. She withdrew it hastily, as she would from the fangs of a viper.</p>
                  <p>"Your wife! Your uncle's widow!" faltered Maria, falling back almost swooning upon her seat. "Can it be that I am not mad? Is this not a horrible dream?"</p>
                  <p>Mark sprang to her side, and passed his arm unresistingly around her waist.</p>
                  <p>"Most fascinating, bewitching Maria," he exclaimed, his face almost touching her own, and his voice thick with the passion which purpled his face. It was the passion of the libertine, however—the passion which disgraces the name of love, and which one like Mark is incapable of feeling.</p>
                  <p>"You are not dreaming," continued he; "you are in the arms of your lover, who adores you!" And he accompanied the words by an attempt to imprint a kiss upon her lips.</p>
                  <p>With sudden energy, Maria released herself from the embrace in which he held her, and pushed him violently from her.</p>
                  <p>"Wretch!" she vehemently exclaimed. "Have you inveigled me into your company only to insult me? Drive me home instantly, or I will alight!"</p>
                  <p>"Hear me, Maria! I offer you only honorable love. Is it an insult to say that I love you?"</p>
                  <p>"Honorable love! You do not know what it is. Every word you say is an insult. If you do not instantly direct the horses' heads to be turned back, I will beg the coachman to give <emph>me</emph> the lines! I will ride upon the box with him, rather than hear another word."</p>
                  <p>Mark saw that he was defeated, and muttered, in a tone of passion quite different from that of a moment ago, while his face was pale with rage, "You will repent of this."</p>
                  <p>He then sullenly ordered the coachman to drive back to Mr. Laybach's, and sunk bank in his seat, without another word. Maria, of course, did not speak again, and they rode in silence till they reached her home. He offered to assist her in alighting, whispering in her ear, as he approached her to do so:</p>
                  <p>"Six months hence you will be glad to accept my offer!"</p>
                  <p>She replied only by a look of scorn, and rejecting his proffered assistance.</p>
                  <p>"What have I done," she asked herself, tears coming to the relief of her swelling heart, when she had reached her room, "what can I have done, to lead him to believe that I would consent to such an unnatural union? <emph>My</emph> husband (<emph>his</emph> uncle) only six months dead!"</p>
                  <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5844-00000024"/>
                  <p>Maria remained long in her room alone. She did not wish to invite an explanation, which her excited manner would not fail to render necessary. She excused herself from the dinner table by some trifling plea.</p>
                  <p>Late in the day, she heard the carriage of Mr. Laybach drive up, and, a few moments after, the summons to supper. She had, by this time, become somewhat composed; but her feelings were still such that she took her seat at the table with little inclination to converse, or to be diverted. Mr. Laybach also was moody, and therefore did not notice anything unusual. For a few moments a complete silence was maintained. It was broken by Mrs. Laybach, who addressed Maria, with a smile:</p>
                  <p>"Neither you nor Mr. Laybach seem to have enjoyed your ride much, to judge by looks. What is the matter?"</p>
                  <p>Maria evaded the inquiry by directing it to Mr. Laybach.</p>
                  <p>"Papa is ill, I think," said she, with an affectionate, inquiring glance.</p>
                  <p>"No, not ill," returned Mr. Laybach, with a sigh. "I am the most unfortunate of men."</p>
                  <p>"What can be the matter?" anxiously queried Maria.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laybach hesitated a moment, then, with a voice a little tremulous, he answered:</p>
                  <p>"I am no longer in my own house—I am ruined!"</p>
                  <p>Maria and Mrs. Laybach both repeated the exclamation:</p>
                  <p>"Ruined! What is it you say, dear papa?" added Maria, springing from her seat, and clasping her arms around his neck.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laybach gently disengaged himself, and with a heavy heart explained the meaning of his previous words. The amount of it was, in a word, Mr. Laybach had incurred liabilities on behalf of a brother who was in business in New York. An unexpected stroke had ruined him, and Mr. Laybach now found himself called on to meet engagements which would swallow up, as he well knew, every dollar of his fortune.</p>
                  <p>"There is only one hope," said he, despondingly, as he finished the narration of the circumstances to his wife and adopted daughter. They eagerly caught at that.</p>
                  <p>"What?" exclaimed both in a breath.</p>
                  <p>"Mark Leavitt is the heaviest creditor of my unfortunate brother—or rather, now, of myself. If he can be induced to compromise, and consent to an extension of time, all may yet be well. have a faint hope that he will do so."</p>
                  <p>Maria's countenance fell. She saw, at a glance, that the adventure of that day, by exciting the bad and revengeful passions of Mark, had destroyed even this, the last hope of her beloved foster parent. And, she bitterly reflected, she herself—though she did not repent her conduct—would be the cause of the last obstacle, which would interfere to prevent the retrieval of Mr. Laybach's fortunes. She leaned her head sadly on her hand, partially hiding her countenance, as these thoughts passed rapidly through her brain.</p>
                  <p>"There is no hope, if a single thing depends upon the generosity of that man," said she, finally. "But <emph>I</emph> am not helpless—all I have is yours, dear papa. It will not repay the debt I owe you."</p>
                  <p>"You forget," returned Mr. Laybach, in an affectionate but sad tone, "you have not come into possession of anything; and if you had, I would not consent to rob you."</p>
                  <p>"Rob me! You gave me all," exclaimed Maria, laying her hand tenderly upon that of Mr. Laybach. "But you say truly," she continued, in a desponding tone, "I can do nothing unless the catastrophe can be put off until I receive what will come to me."</p>
                  <p>"Everything depends upon Mark," replied Mr. Laybach. "The ruin cannot be averted a day, unless he will consent to stop it."</p>
                  <p>"At least, we can preserve the mansion, and still have a home. We shall not be so badly off, dear papa, after all. I <emph>shall</emph> have enough, if I have not now. I am <emph>so</emph> glad that I can do a little towards repaying my obligations to you. So, don't let the business disturb you, papa," continued Maria, imprinting a kiss upon his forehead. "We shall be comfortable and happy yet, without asking Mark Leavitt's favor."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laybach replied by an affectionate look, and Mrs. Laybach overwhelmed Maria with kind and grateful expressions.</p>
                  <p>That night the brain of Maria was filled with conflicting, but on the whole, pleasing thoughts. If, as she reflected, she had unwittingly, and in doing nothing more than her duty demanded, probably accelerated the downfall of her foster parents, she was more than gratified to know that she would soon have the means of alleviating its consequences, and preserving the family mansion from passing out of their hands. The exciting events of the day had overtasked her brain; she fell asleep while her waking train of thought still occupied her slumbering fancy. But even then, the pleasure she pictured to herself, in doing a generous and unselfish action, was disturbed by hateful visions of Mark, who hung over her like a nightmare.</p>
                  <p>The next day, Mr. Laybach called on Mark early in the fore part. The result was what Maria had predicted. Glad of inflicting a blow upon Mr. Laybach, which he knew would equally touch Maria, and thus give him a sweet revenge, he would listen to no propositions, but demanded that the letter of <choice>
                        <sic>al hlis</sic>
                        <corr>all his</corr>
                     </choice> creditor's engagements should be strictly kept. Mr. Laybach returned home despairing. But he was a man of honor, in the commercial as well as the general sense. He had promised, therefore, to satisfy the claims of all the creditors without waiting for legal process, though it left him penniless.</p>

                  <head type="sub">STANTON AND ELLEN LEAVITT.</head>
                  <p>THAT the promising young attorney, Stanton, was violently in love with Ellen Leavitt, became more apparent. He had, at first, scarcely acknowledged it to himself; but he was not long in doing so. He could not help it. He was blinded to everything else; he no longer remembered his pure and long-cherished love for Maria. He forgot his declarations to her that no other one could induce him to dethrone her image from his heart. He was intoxicated (infatuated, we might almost say), by the singular fascinations of Ellen, which we can compare to nothing. Her wit, her gay manners, her varied accomplishments, which made her an ornament of the ball-room, all these did did not have so much effect upon Stanton, as that nameless magic, which gives some women such a dangerous power over the opposite sex.</p>
                  <p>Stanton rode, and walked, and spent long evenings with her; he accompanied her to every public place; he was her inseparable companion, and declared lover. It was not long, however, before he was an accepted one.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding this, it would be curious to inquire whether Ellen also loved Stanton in return. Was it such a sentiment which led her to accept him (who, though an ambitious and rising lawyer, was not decidedly an "eligible," in point of fortune), when she had successively rejected much more splendid offers? Had all the world been mistaken in judging of her motives, and had she acted throughout with regard to the dictates of her heart? The idea was absolutely inadmissible by any one who knew her well, and knew, with all her fascinations, what a haughty, cold selfishness had eaten and rusted away the little <emph>heart</emph> which she might ever have possessed. We are compelled, therefore, to look for other reasons for her conduct.</p>
                  <p>Ellen had not been wholly unconscious of the previous state of Stanton's feelings—it only sharpened her hatred of the inoffending and gentle Maria. By attracting him away from her, she simply intended to do Maria a disservice; other circumstances growing out of Mark's mercenary projects upon his uncle's property supervened, and led her to accept Stanton, as then the only means of depriving Maria of an ally dangerous to their schemes. What these schemes and reasons were, will be displayed in the sequel.</p>
                  <p>Stanton saw Maria only upon business. He felt humbled in her presence; her quiet, sad, but still cordial air reproached him (so he felt) for his estrangement, and made his present passion seem a madness beside his earlier and loftier love. But these effects were only momentary—he was not often exposed to them; and Ellen's star, after they had gone, always rose higher, and gleamed over his heart still more like the Sirius which it was. Stanton was surprised one day, not long after the events mentioned in the previous chapter, to receive a visit from Brownly Brown, Esq., whom he had always carefully avoided. He saluted the unscrupulous pettifogger, therefore, as he entered his office, distantly, and in a cold tone inquired what service he could render for him. Mr. Brown answered, by handing to him a sealed document, which Stanton took and glanced at the endorsement. It was entitled "<title>The Last Will and Testament of Mr. Jacob Leavitt.</title>" He looked in astonishment from the paper to Mr. Brown.</p>
                  <p>"What is this?" he inquired, as if he could not believe his eyes.</p>
                  <p>"It is what you see," returned Brown. "It is a will which I drew up at Mr. Leavitt's request not long before his death. It was executed at his house, in my presence, and sealed up—by an accident I took it away with me. When I discovered the mistake, I intended to return it, and until yesterday supposed that I had done so. I stumbled over it by accident also, in looking over a drawer in my office. It is sufficient for me to exhibit it to you," he continued, resuming possession of the document, "since I know its contents. I shall surrender my accidental trust to Mr. Leavitt's nephew and heir, who is named executor."</p>
                  <p>So saying, he withdrew. Stanton mused a moment, and a vague suspicion flitted over his mind; but on second thought, he concluded nothing to be more natural than that a will should have been made by Mr. Leavitt. He hastened to inform Maria of the circumstance. She had no knowledge of any will, and did not believe that her husband ever had employed Brown, but she could not speak with certainty. But the communication threw her into a profound grief, since, as Stanton told her, all that had been done in settling her late husband's estate would be of no account, but that the tedious process of law must be again gone through. And in a very few weeks, before she could possibly receive her share out of the estate, Mr. Laybach would be driven from his home, and she should be helpless to save him. She entreated Stanton to hurry the business as fast as possible; but she did not tell him the distress which sent her weeping to her room when he had gone.</p>
                  <p>The will was duly presented for probate by Mark, who was sole executor named. Maria's name was not even mentioned; but the whole estate was bequeathed in equal portions to Mark and his sister Ellen. Stanton examined it closely; there was no disputing its genuine character. The only circumstance of suspicion in the matter was Brown's agency; but this was overcome by the unimpeachable character of the two witnesses to the execution of the paper.</p>
                  <p>This new instance of neglect and cold unkindness towards Maria, on the part of her husband, added new poignancy to the sorrows which already overwhelmed her. The circumstance of Mr. Laybach's inextricable embarrassment alone induced her to insist (as Stanton informed her that she might) upon her rights of dower. But she did this with visible reluctance, compelled only by her anxious desire to soften the misfortunes of her foster parent.</p>
                  <p>It seemed, indeed, as if every adverse circumstance crowded upon the unfortunate, but still young and lovely Maria. Every day seemed to make an addition to her load of griefs, which lacerated her heart. Yet did she wear still the same quiet, gentle demeanor, and her countenance bore yet no furrowed traces of discontent or impatience; but only the same unobtrusive, tender melancholy, which diffused itself over her delicate features, like a cloud before the summer sun shading a bank of violets.</p>
                  <p>A few weeks passed by, and Mr. Laybach found himself compelled to leave his fair mansion, which he had been forced to sell, and to take up his residence in a humble house in the village. But the necessity was not so galling to his pride, as it was to Maria's affections. She drowned her own griefs in sorrow at her inability to do anything to avert the storm; and for the sake of her foster parents, looked forward with the most anxious impatience to the acquirement of her own means, which would enable her to alleviate the bitterness of their misfortune. This she had a near prospect of being able to do.</p>
                  <p>Mark's final accounting as executor was but a few days off. By an order obtained from court, he had converted all the immovable property into available funds, and he announced himself quite ready for a distribution.</p>

                  <head type="sub">A DOUBLE ECLAIRCISSEMENT.</head>
                  <p>"IT never rains, but it pours," is the doctrine of a homely, quaint adage; it is truer in its metaphorical than its natural meaning.</p>
                  <p>Mark Leavitt spent a great portion of his time in the city, indulging in the most extravagant habits. He played, gave costly entertainments, and, generally, was plunged into the wildest excesses. At home he preserved the appearances of sobriety, and led a life which did not subject him to great scandal; but really, at the time we speak of, he was nearly bankrupted by his many extravagances.</p>
                  <p>A few days before the final settlement of affairs was to come on, Mark went to New York, saying he should return in time. The day had now arrived, and Stanton attended in court, as Maria's agent; but Mark did not appear. Some time was passed in waiting, when Stanton, who was impatient, determined to go to his house. Ellen was in the sitting-room; she rose hastily, for he had not announced himself. He inquired for Mark.</p>
                  <p>"Sit down here with me on this <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tete-a-tete,</foreign>" said Ellen, seating herself again by way of reply.</p>
                  <p>"I have no time," begun Stanton.</p>
                  <p>"You <emph>have</emph> time; I shall tell you nothing if you refuse," said Ellen, in an affected pet. Her slightest wishes were law to him—he complied. "You would neglect <emph>me</emph> for business," continued she, in the same tone. "I will not occupy any such secondary place. But now that you are reasonable, I will answer your question. Read that; I have just taken it from the post-office."</p>
                  <p>Stanton took the note. It ran simply thus:</p>

                  <p>"Heavens!" exclaimed Stanton, "what has he done?"</p>
                  <p>"He has simply settled the estate by carrying it all off with him," replied Ellen, in the coolest possible manner, and without changing a feature.</p>
                  <p>"And you knew of this?" inquired Stanton, with a look of surprise and reproach.</p>
                  <p>"Do you accuse me?" queried Ellen, her eyes flashing upon him with a glance which subdued him in an instant, adding haughtily, "I am not on the witness stand; I shall not answer."</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me," returned he, in a confused tone, "I meant nothing. But it will ruin Maria."</p>
                  <p>A momentary gleam shot from Ellen's eyes.</p>
                  <p>"I know it," replied she, in a cold, matter of-course tone.</p>
                  <p>Stanton sat a moment in silence, then rose to go.</p>
                  <p>"What are you going to do?" inquired Ellen. "Are you still so much attached to your <emph>old flame</emph> that you wish to pursue my brother?"</p>
                  <p>Stanton felt the sneer; but he had become so infatuated, her slightest word could command his resolution. He hesitated a moment, as if a painful struggle were going on in his mind. He finally said:</p>
                  <p>"I must inform Mrs. Leavitt of the circumstance, since I am her counsel. But I shall certainly, dear Ellen, do nothing to wound your feelings."</p>
                  <p>So saying, he took his hat, and directed his steps towards the cottage in which Maria now resided with her foster-parents. He entered and found her sitting alone. She welcomed him with a smile—the same quiet smile which, at times, found its old lodgment in Stanton's heart. He communicated the intelligence to her in a few brief words; and, regarding his promise to Ellen, held out to her no hope, as he might have done.</p>
                  <p>"Just Heaven!" exclaimed Maria, in despairing accents, "am I to be forever the victim of misfortune?"</p>
                  <p>She covered her face with her hands; she held up for a moment, but the emotion was too much for her nerves, already strung to their highest tension. She sunk back; pale and fainting, and would have fallen upon the floor, had not Stanton sprang to her side. He caught her in his arms, his pulses beating hotly and rapidly. That voice, which once had been such music to his soul; that form, which had once been his ecstacy to touch; the sorrow-laden cadence of the one, the pale lifelessness of the other—the effect of <emph>his</emph> words—smote him now with sudden and powerful remorse. The old passion returned like a rushing flood upon his heart; he trembled and staggered beneath his delicate burden. His love for Ellen in that moment rose up before him like a hideous phantasy—he awoke as from a long dream of infatuation, intoxication and wild frenzy.</p>
                  <p>"Maria, Maria!" The whispered, in thick, agonized tones, in her unconscious car. "Awake, return! Your life-long lover calls you back! O, God, what have I done? How have I dreamed?"</p>
                  <p>He showered her pale forehead, her violethued eyelids, her blanched lips, with passionate kisses; he strained her fragile, ethereal from to his bounding heart. Maria opened her eyes amidst these passionate demonstrations; again and again he imprinted burning kisses upon her cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"Maria, dearest Maria," exclaimed he, "say that you can forgive your wandering lover—my heart is forever yours."</p>
                  <p>Maria started up and released herself from his arms.</p>
                  <p>"You!" she exclaimed, "the betrothed husband of Ellen Leavitt! False to me—false to her! Can it be possible that you are not mad?"</p>
                  <p>"I <emph>have been</emph> mad," replied Stanton, huskily, sinking down before her. "I have been drugged into horrible forgetfulness and frightful dreams. But the spell is over; my heart has returned to its true allegiance, never more to wander. Believe me, Maria, I love you with a love which cannot die! Do not, do not, I entreat you, I conjure you, if you have one spark of mercy left for me, do not reject it!"</p>
                  <p>These tones were passionately, despairingly sincere; the light of love struggled on his pale, dreamy countenance, with the dark shadows of trembling fear. Maria's heart overflowed with old, long pent-up feelings; her head fell trustingly on his breast, while tears of conflicting emotion came into her eyes. He clasped her warmly to his bosom, he covered her lips again with kisses, as he whispered, in heartful tones:</p>
                  <p>"We shall be happy yet, dear Maria. Forget the frightful past!"</p>
                  <p>She lay for a moment confidingly and unresistingly in his arms; then she again released herself with gentle force from his grasp. She covered her face for a moment to hide the tears which flowed freely, but soon wiping them from her eyes, she assumed a more distant air, and said, in a voice which struggled to be calm and cold:</p>
                  <p>"It cannot be, Mr. Stanton; I cannot listen to the vows of a man who is at this moment affianced to another. You deceive her, or you deceive me."</p>
                  <p>"Maria, Maria!" returned Stanton, vehemently, "this language is cruel! I confess that I have been led astray; I have been guilty of treason to my own heart. Will you forbid me to repent? This hour has cured my fatal madness! this day will I tell Ellen that I am free from her baneful influence. O, Maria, consent then to be mine! I pray you not to destroy my first hope of returning happiness."</p>
                  <p>Maria remained silent for a moment. Stanton's manner convinced her that he was in earnest<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5844-00000027"/> est, but pride forbade her to alter the decision she had given; she consented to modify it a little.</p>
                  <p>"No more now," she said, firmly. "Your future conduct may induce me to hear you again."</p>
                  <p>Stanton humbly acquiesced in her command; he merely answered, "Permit me, then, to hope!"</p>
                  <p>And saying which, he left the room, with a countenance on which various emotions expressed themselves; but high above all shone a stern resolve, which exalted his air and braced his steps.</p>
                  <p>He had not proceeded many steps before he encountered Old Sam, the late faithful servitor of Maria—faithful still, but no longer in her service, under the altered condition of her life. She had felt herself compelled to discharge him, sorely against her own inclinations, and greatly to the grief of Old Sam, who would have been willing to follow her fallen fortunes, no matter how low they went. In Stanton's present state of feeling, the sight of this one honest being, whose feelings of devotion had suffered no change towards Maria, was both a reproach and a pleasure to him; and he grasped the hand of the battered old sailor with almost fraternal affection.</p>
                  <p>"Misfortune is never tired of harassing your mistress," said he, in a sympathizing tone, which he knew would find an echo in the old man's breast. Stanton related to him the story which has been already told.</p>
                  <p>"The rascally smuggler!" exclaimed Old Sam, with an energetic gesture. "I always said that Mark Leavitt deserved to be strung from the yard arm. I hope I shall live to see it done, yet! You'll give chase, wont you?"</p>
                  <p>Stanton shook his head doubtfully.</p>
                  <p>"It's too bad to let the lubberly shark off so, while there's a shot in the locker. <emph>I'll</emph> follow him, if you'll only let me; if <emph>I</emph> get once alongside, I'll haul down his pirate flag. Only tell me to go, Mr. Stanton, and I'll start to-morrow, if I have to go in a long boat."</p>
                  <p>"It would be useless, my good fellow," returned Stanton. "Besides, there is yet one remedy; we will first try that."</p>
                  <p>"I hate to see Mark get off so," said Old Sam, a little discontentedly. "It's just as you say, though, Mr. Stanton."</p>
                  <p>A few more words passed, when Stanton left Old Sam to go directly to his office. Judge B——, who, since Stanton's remarkable display of powers in a cause argued before him, which we mentioned, had been Stanton's steadfast friend, he found awaiting him. The old judge rose and extended his hand. After the usual civilities of meeting, he said:</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Stanton, you are district attorney for this district. I congratulate you."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>I!</emph>" returned Stanton, in some surprise—for though he was not ignorant that his name had been proposed, he had, from the apparent hopelessness of the case, made only faint exertions to attain the honor; and therefore the announcement came unexpectedly upon him.</p>
                  <p>"I presume I am indebted to you, judge, for this distinction. I am deeply sensible of the obligation."</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE PURSUIT.—THE DISMISSAL.</head>
                  <p>THE next day, day after, indeed, a week passed after Stanton's interview with Maria, and he did not once visit his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fiancee,</foreign> Ellen Leavitt. Once only, either, did he see Maria—then simply to announce to her that Mark's securities were forgeries; and that, therefore, all hope of recovering her share of her husband's property was quite destroyed. He did not dare yet say more to her, though he burned to do so.</p>
                  <p>The discovery of Mark's double villany excited the strongest feelings in Stanton's breast. He wondered and reproached himself that such consummate knavery should have existed beneath his eyes, and yet escape undetected, until it had finished all the mischief at which it aimed. He felt now a threefold interest in bringing Mark to punishment; beside a natural desire to see justice done, he wished to see Maria avenged, and his own possible remissness excused. But there seemed to be little hope of a successful pursuit of Mark; though the gentlemen whose names he had forged, insisted upon a trial, and Old Sam begged Stanton to be permitted to exhibit in this way his devotion to his mistress. An indictment for forgery having been found against Mark, Old Sam finally obtained the necessary authority and means to follow him by the next steamer, and, if possible, to bring him back to justice. Stanton had little confidence in the proceeding—less in the old sailor's skill to manage it; but he could not resist the honest servitor's urgent entreaties and Maria's desire. Old Sam started, therefore, vowing that he would make a voyage around the world, before he would give up search for the villain who had robbed his late kind-hearted and unfortunate mistress.</p>
                  <p>Stanton was in a dilemma with reference to Ellen, which, now that nothing remained to be done in the affair of Mark's defalcation (or rather, now that nothing more could be done at present), recurred in full force upon him. How was he to put an end to the relation which subsisted between him and the sister of the defaulter! To do it in some way, he was quite fully and firmly resolved since his interview with Maria; the only question was, how to manage the delicate business. It must be confessed, he felt embarrassed; this embarrassment and consequent indecision finally designated to him his course of action. He sat in his office one afternoon, his mind running on this subject, when a servant from Willow Place placed a lady-like note in his hand. It was from Ellen, simply signifying her wish to see him immediately. This summons was, of course, not to be disobeyed; and Stanton rose, inwardly resolving to make this call the occasion of putting an end to his present state of embarrassment. He half expected a storm, since<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5844-00000028"/> he knew Ellen's temper, which would not brook neglect; and, indeed, he more than half desired one—preferring to encounter Ellen's anger, than to expose himself again to the strange power of her fascinations. The one he felt equal to; the other, he did not know himself well enough to be even yet without fears.</p>
                  <p>As he approached the house, a new consideration presented itself. What justification could he plead for the violation of a solemn promise? Not to Ellen (he was not at all fearful of <emph>her</emph> requiring from him any justification), but to his own conscience. He reached the house and rang the bell, without having found any better than the one he gave Maria—<emph>madness.</emph> Rather humbling, it was, to entertain and plead, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">in foro conscientiae</foreign>, <emph>such</emph> a defence for the course he proposed to take—but not more so than the reflection, that it was for Ellen Leavitt that his heart had strayed away from its early and holy love.</p>
                  <p>He had not much time, however, for debating the question. His ring was answered, and he found himself in a moment in the parlor, whose reminiscences, a short time before so pleasing, now were hateful and humiliating. He could not help feeling a little awkward on Ellen's appearance; but her manner, which was cold and distant, soon rid him of that by rousing his pride.</p>
                  <p>"I am greatly obliged to you, Mr. Stanton, for your condescension in honoring my request so promptly," began Ellen. "I appreciate the honor, since I know how valuable your time has become. Don't trouble yourself for an apology," she added, as Stanton hesitated in replying to this address. "You have not called upon me in nearly two weeks. I know the reason; you have been too busy in branding a felon's mark upon my brother's name. I have no control over <emph>your</emph> actions; I only charge you with making me, his sister, an accomplice in your baseness."</p>
                  <p>Ellen's eye flashed, as she said this, with magnificent <foreign xml:lang="FRA">hauteur.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>"You, an accomplice! You charge me with a crime!"</p>
                  <p>"I charge you with a <emph>baseness,</emph> Mr. Stanton. Your conduct has not had the dignity even of crime."</p>
                  <p>"Will you favor me by being a little more explicit, Miss Leavitt? I confess I do not understand your language when applied to me."</p>
                  <p>"Your conscience does not accuse you? I will come down, then, to your comprehension. Was it not enough that you constantly took the part of that amiable hypocrite, Maria, against us, that you should also use the confidential information which <emph>I</emph> gave you, in order to institute criminal prosecutions and pursuit of my brother?"</p>
                  <p>"As to that, the information was public. I had a right—and, as a public officer", it was my duty to act upon it."</p>
                  <p>"Public!" exclaimed Ellen, her eyes flashing still more scornfully, "How came it so? I confess, it was public as soon as I told it to you in confidence, and under your promise that you would do nothing to my brother's injury."</p>
                  <p>"Your brother is a felon," returned Stanton, his anger rising at Ellen's tone and taunts. "I made no promises to shield a criminal."</p>
                  <p>"You taunt me with <emph>his</emph> misfortunes! An admirable sense of justice in a distinguished district attorney, whose duty it would seem to be to obtain information like a spy, and act upon it like an informer! Permit me to say, Mr. Stanton, that I do not admire the character. I have no faith in a man who breaks one promise—who betrays me for a scheming pauper. Go, marry my uncle's widow, if you please, and share all that you gain from your conduct towards my brother. I absolve you from all promises made to me. It will save you the baseness of breaking them."</p>
                  <p>Ellen's face was pale, and her eye darted lightnings of scorn. Stanton rose.</p>
                  <p>"I will not recriminate, Miss Leavitt. I will not, to a lady, use the language which I might be forced to employ."</p>
                  <p>"I despise your lenity! Do your worst, Mr. Stanton! I dare say it will not entirely overwhelm me," interrupted Ellen, sarcastically. Stanton did not notice the remark, but proceeded:</p>
                  <p>"Neither shall I defend my conduct, since you do not require it. But I must be permitted to express my obligations to you, for relieving me of an engagement which is equally distasteful to both of us. I am happy to find that we agree so well, finally."</p>
                  <p>Ellen's face at this sarcasm grew paler than before with anger. She stamped her foot, and darted a fiery glance at Stanton.</p>
                  <p>"Impertinent!" she began, in a tone of passion. "You—"</p>
                  <p>But Stanton did not wait to hear the conclusion of the sentence. With a suave countenance and a graceful bow, he begged permission to wish her good evening, and left the parlor, leaving Ellen still more vexed at his exit, which deprived her of all further opportunity to vent her anger upon him. The coolness with which Stanton received his dismissal, too, excessively irritated her pride, as well as disappointed her calculations. She had relied upon the possession of so much influence over him, that she might treat him as she pleased, and still compel him to remain devoted to her. She wished to humble him; to frighten him from the course he was pursuing towards her brother; to drive him to give up Maria. But, for certain potent reasons, she <emph>did not</emph> wish to drive him away from herself, as her language imported, and which she now saw Stanton was glad to accept in its literal sense, without a word of entreaty or submission. She had overdone her purposes—foiled them by her own violence; which, however, instead of causing her to reproach herself, made her only the more bitter against Stanton, and Maria, who now nearly equally shared her hatred.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, Stanton left the house and returned to his office, heartily rejoiced that Ellen had given him the clue, without any exertion on his own part, to escape from his perplexities. She had dismissed him, and there his own responsibility in the matter ceased.</p>
                  <p>On the following day, Stanton resolved to call and see Maria, to urge again upon her his suit, to which all obstacles he conceived to be now removed. She could not, he thought, if she entertained for him a spark of the feeling which he wished her to; if she reciprocated in any degree the passion which burned in his breast with still greater ardor because of its momentary eclipse, she could not refuse to reward it with her hand.</p>
                  <p>It was a bright and beautiful afternoon. The elements seemed to promise him all that he desired most, and he walked along in the direction of Mr. Laybach's cottage, his heart beating high with hope. He reached it, and was shown into the humble parlor. This contrasted violently with the elegance which Maria had possessed in former days—with the elegance which he had witnessed on the previous afternoon surrounding Ellen Leavitt. But such reflections did not have room in his thoughts when Maria appeared, looking to him as lovely as ever, in her half weeds, her gentle and quiet air.</p>
                  <p>Stanton proposed a walk, Maria consented, and in a moment was ready to accompany him.</p>
                  <p>"What a glorious sunset!" exclaimed Stanton, as they sallied out together. "Isn't it singular? That single cloud, the only one in sight, standing like a massive shield, its thick edges brilliant with gold, before the fiery sun. I should wish Alexander Smith could see that. Do you read Smith? <q>

                  <p>"Does not wisdom tell you," replied Maria, with a significant smile, and glance at Stanton, "never to waste your worship on a <emph>setting</emph> sun?"</p>
                  <p>There was a slight tinge of melancholy in Maria's tone, despite her smile, which instantly caused Stanton to make an application of her remark.</p>
                  <p>"I worship the beautiful everywhere," replied he, warmly. "It is, therefore, that I worship <emph>you,</emph> Maria, and have worshipped you so long. But you are not a setting sun; you are young and beautiful still, but colder to me than the moon's rays. Why do you treat me so, Maria?"</p>
                  <p>"Do you not deserve it? Have you forgotten that you are affianced to Ellen Leavitt?"</p>
                  <p>"It is true no longer," returned Stanton, impetuously. "She has dismissed me."</p>
                  <p>"And so, rejected by her, you plead to me. It is amusing!" And Maria burst into a laugh which had lost none of its ringing music. Stanton colored with vexation.</p>
                  <p>"You are unreasonable," replied he. "Was it not before my rejection (if you choose to call it such, when she only anticipated me), that I offered you my love?—and did you not bid me hope?"</p>
                  <p>"You are too impatient!"</p>
                  <p>"Impatient! How many years is it since I first became a suitor for your hand? If you love me, Maria, but one iota—if there is a single spark of regard for me in your breast, I beseech you to end my suspense!"</p>
                  <p>Stanton's tones were earnest and passionate. Maria hesitated a moment before replying. She finally said:</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Stanton, I will do you justice. I confess that your sentiments are not without an echo in my breast; that my heart was yours, even when I refused your love on the eve of my wedding with Mr. Leavitt. Truly, it was never otherwise. But I rejected you for gold and position. I was guilty in doing as I did. I confess it, and my punishment has been just."</p>
                  <p>Her voice faltered, and she wiped a tear from her eye as she reached this point. She continued:</p>
                  <p>"My duty bade me reprove your rash advances<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5844-00000029"/> vances, while I was Mr. Leavitt's wife—but God pardon me the feelings which struggled with my duty! I sinned in entertaining them—it is another reason why I have rightly suffered. Now, it is true, there is no legal impediment between us, but circumstances are changed. I refused you when you might justly have accused me of preferring the wealth of another to yourself. Now, I am unfortunate, and you are fortunate. You have gathered fame, position, and no doubt with them wealth, or the near prospect of it. We have simply changed places. Let it not be said that I refused you when I was fortunate and happy, and accept you when I am unfortunate and—but I will not add <emph>unhappy;</emph> I am contented. I will deal frankly by you. I have given you my sentiments towards you; but I must add also, that unless kind fortune returns me my inheritance, so wrongfully taken from me, I shall never accept the hand of any man. I shall live to do penance for my faults, which brought all my misfortunes upon me."</p>
                  <p>A bright flush suffused the face of the speaker; she walked with her eyes fixed modestly on the ground. In vain Stanton urged upon her the injustice of acting upon the motives she had suggested, the unnecessary self-sacrifice, the needlessness of her scruples, the hopelessness of ever regaining the fortune which Mark had no doubt squandered.</p>
                  <p>"You sacrifice your own feelings to the fear of a suspicion which no one who knows you can entertain—which I am the first to scout. You do yourself—you do me wrong. I beg of you to recall that decision," urged Stanton.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot do so; I am resolved!" firmly replied Maria. "I will not deny," she added, blushing slightly, "that I <emph>hope;</emph> and I do not forbid you, if your feelings do not change, to hope also. But nothing can induce me to change my resolution."</p>
                  <p>As she pronounced these words, she stopped before the gate of her own house. Stanton seized her hand, which she did not withdraw, and pressed it passionately in his own.</p>
                  <p>"You madden me, Maria! How can you be so cruel?" exclaimed he, in earnest but desponding accents.</p>
                  <p>"Forget me, Fred!" (it was a long time since she had pronounced that familiar name, and it sounded musically in Stanton's ears.) "Forget me, forget the past!" she answered. But the tear that stood in her eye belied the wish expressed in words.</p>
                  <p>"Never, never!" was Stanton's vehement ejaculation; and pressing her hand again with warm fervor, he turned down the street, and Maria entered the house.</p>
                  <p>Stanton returned moodily home, and now looked with the most eager anxiety for news from Old Sam. He counted the days which must elapse before the arrival of a Liverpool steamer, with the anxious interest of a man condemned to death notching upon a stick the daily consumption of his brief span of life. With little more hope, indeed, did he look for the news. He had no reasonable expectation that it would prove favorable; but, like the unhappy criminal, still indulged himself in dreams of some miraculous interposition, which would give him a respite of happiness.</p>
                  <p>When the day at last came, he was wrought up into a fever of anxiety. He was not disappointed in receiving a letter, post-marked at Liverpool, and bearing unmistakable evidence of being from Old Sam. He opened and read it with trembling haste and eagerness. The letter was unique—we give a copy:</p>

                  <p>The letter crushed Stanton's hopes, which had involuntarily arisen on its receipt. He fell almost into despair, and cursed himself for relying upon an old sailor like Sam, who, notwithstanding his devotion, evidently did not know how to take the first step towards the object he had in view. He sent the letter to Maria, but did not call then. He hardly dared to trust himself.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">SUCCESS OF OLD SAM'S MISSION.</head>
                  <p>SOME weeks rolled by—another steamer arrived. This time it brought <emph>no</emph> news from Old Sam. It was just as well; intelligence, Stanton thought, would only confirm his fears and expectations. He called several times on Maria, and urged her again and again to recall her decision. But she was immovable; gently but firmly she insisted on keeping her resolution, and Stanton was in despair.</p>
                  <p>Thus, as we said, some weeks passed. A third steamer was due; she arrived, and yet no news from Old Sam. Stanton began to think that he was himself lost, and, instead of taking Mark, had been unable even to take care of himself.</p>
                  <p>He was sitting in his office the third day after the steamer's arrival, busily engaged in the preparation of an important case, when, raising his eyes for a moment, he say Old Sam standing within a foot of his desk. An exclamation of surprise burst from Stanton's lips.</p>
                  <p>"Why, my good fellow, when did you arrive? How long have you been standing there?"</p>
                  <p>"Only a minnit," returned Old Sam, a broad smile extending all over his coarse features. "I thought I wouldn't disturb you, as I see you are busy."</p>
                  <p>"Disturb me! Why, I would have thrown a farm in the fire to see you, Sam! What news?" eagerly ejaculated Stanton.</p>
                  <p>"I've got him!" returned Sam, shrugging his shoulders with a seaman's hitch, and the smile on his face extending his mouth to an alarming extent.</p>
                  <p>Stanton grasped the old sailor's hand with an expression of extravagant delight.</p>
                  <p>"My good fellow, you are worth your weight in gold! The whole detective police of London couldn't have done more! Where is he?"</p>
                  <p>Sam made a significant gesture over his shoulder in the direction of the jail.</p>
                  <p>"Lying at anchor over there in the brig," was the sententious answer.</p>
                  <p>"Capital! You have done me a magnificent service!" said Stanton. "You shall be rewarded."</p>
                  <p>"Enough said on that tack," replied Old Sam, with a kind of sturdy good nature. "Old Sam don't care for money, as long as <emph>this</emph> is all right"—tapping a side pocket, in which his constant companion, a black flask, peered suspiciously out. "I hope you don't think, Mr. Stanton, <emph>that's</emph> what I went for. Catch an old hulk like me going such a vy'ge for <emph>money!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"No, no, my good fellow, I did not mean to offend you, or to insinuate anything of the kind. I know it was your regard for your mistress which led you to undertake the enterprise, and<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5844-00000030"/> the sentiment does you honor. <emph>She</emph> will reward you."</p>
                  <p>"That's it, that's it!" exclaimed Old Sam. "It'll be all the pay <emph>I</emph> want, just to see how it will please her."</p>
                  <p>"But tell me how you managed the affair. I was much afraid you would not succeed so well."</p>
                  <p>"Well, you see, I writ you when I got to Liverpool. I couldn't find him there, so I went to London—London's a mighty big city, Mr. Stanton; I never could tell what latitude I was in, when I was cruising about. Well, one day I was on a cruise round the streets, first on one tack and then on the other, when all to once I thought I see Mark, looking as careless and independent like, as if he hadn't robbed his uncle's widow of every cent. I followed on behind him until he went into a house; then I went and got a policeman, and we nabbed him handsomely in his room. I don't know much about the rest, until they give me a lot of papers, and put Mark into my hands and told me to carry him safe back. Blow me, if I didn't do that, any way. He's safe, I guess, where he is now.</p>
                  <p>"I've got the papers all here, too," added Sam, fumbling in his pocket, and producing a parcel of documents. "I s'pose I'm to give them up to you. I don't know what else to do with 'em."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I would like to examine them," replied Stanton, taking the parcel from Old Sam's hand.</p>
                  <p>The latter immediately made his exit, saying that he had not yet announced the intelligence to Mrs. Leavitt. Stanton saw, on a glance at the parcel, that it was directed to the executive officer; and he lost no time in transmitting it to the proper quarter.</p>
                  <p>In a little more than a week, a court of Oyer and Terminer was to be held at P——. In this court, as the indictment against Mark still stood, the trial would come on, and Stanton set instantly at work preparing for the event—as, being district attorney, it would be his duty to conduct the prosecution.</p>
                  <p>Mark, too, being aware of the probable speedy approach of his trial, employed counsel, and made preparations for a vigorous defence. In these arrangements, Brownly Brown, Esq. was unusually active; and from this and various other circumstances, Stanton suspected that an attempt would be made to sustain the validity of the disputed securities by suborned witnesses.</p>
                  <p>Among the papers of which Old Sam had been the bearer, was one which afforded far more satisfaction than the capture of Mark, or any other circumstance in the whole affair. It was an intimation that Mark had a large sum deposited in the Bank of England, which would be subject to a proper draft. He immediately obtained a sort of interlocutory order to restrain its disposal by Mark, and to await the judgment of the court.</p>
                  <p>A day or two before the trial came on, while Stanton was busily engaged in preparation, he was interrupted by the entrance of a rough-looking individual, coarsely dressed, and his hat drawn down over his eyes. He stood for a moment regarding Stanton, who questioned him by a glance.</p>
                  <p>"You don't know me," briefly remarked the individual.</p>
                  <p>"I confess it," replied Stanton. "What do you want?"</p>
                  <p>"Never saw me before, eh?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't think I've had the honor. What has that to do with your business?"</p>
                  <p>"A good deal," replied the other. "You know Mrs. Leavitt, of course?"</p>
                  <p>Stanton assented.</p>
                  <p>"You were at her wedding some years ago?"</p>
                  <p>Stanton gave another impatient nod.</p>
                  <p>"Well," continued the stranger, "I was a guest also; but they didn't treat me well—they kicked me out. Do you guess who I am now?"</p>
                  <p>"Miss Seeley's—Mrs. Leavitt's father!" exclaimed Stanton, in surprise.</p>
                  <p>"All gammon, my boy—all gammon!" replied the other, with a significant gyration of his fingers.</p>
                  <p>"You are not then—"</p>
                  <p>"Not a bit of it—no more than you are, my boy! That's what I come to tell you about. I'm one of Mark's witnesses; but he has cheated me, and I mean to cheat him, and get my revenge. So when I come to swear, you may ask me what questions you like. That's all—I wanted to give you a hint. Act upon it as you please."</p>
                  <p>So saying, the stranger drew his hat down again over his brow, and abruptly turned on his heel and left the office, not seeming to hear Stanton's call.</p>
                  <p>At first, Stanton hardly knew what to make of this mysterious visit, and equally mysterious intimations. Had that affair of the wedding night also been one of Mark's villanous plots? The suspicious affair of the settlement also came to his mind; and though he could see little light on either subject, he determined to keep a close watch on any revelation which might be elicited in the course of the proceedings.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE TRIAL—DENOUEMENT.</head>
                  <p>THE morning of the trial came. All P—— was in excitement, and the court room was crowded with spectators. Mark sat by the side of his counsel, apparently as unconcerned as any. A sardonic smile flitted across his face whenever he chanced to glance over the court room, and saw the eager eyes which were fixed on him and on the proceedings. Ellen was also within the bar near Mark; but she was so closely veiled, that the expression of her countenance could not be seen.</p>
                  <p>After a few preliminary proceedings—there always are preliminary proceedings in a court—Stanton briefly opened the case on the part of the people, and then called his witnesses. Their evidence, which could be of course only circumstantial, was still strong against the genuineness of the signatures of Mark's official bonds; and enough similar evidence was also brought forward to induce looks of intelligence among the jurors.</p>
                  <p>The people then rested.</p>
                  <p>Mark's counsel arose, and simply begged the jury to mark how plain a tale would put to flight all the uncertain circumstantial evidence against his client. He proposed to show by two unimpeachable witnesses that Messrs. Pratt and Wilson—the gentlemen whose names are charged to be forged—did sign the bonds in question, and that, therefore, these signatures were not forgeries. He called Matthew Clark.</p>
                  <p>A voice in the audience answered the call, and the person to whom the voice belonged approached the witness stand. Stanton looked curiously around to see who the witness could be, whose name he had never before heard. As he neared the box, Stanton recognized instantly the mysterious individual who had paid him such an abrupt visit a day or two before. The witness caught Stanton's eye, and gave him a sort of sly wink and indescribable grimace, as if to put him on his recollection. The opposite counsel did not notice it, but Mark did, and looked in stern wonder at Clark. Being sworn to tell the whole truth, Mark's counsel finally condescended to raise his head, and, handing the witness the disputed bonds, asked, with the most indifferent, matter-of-course air, whether he was acquainted with the signatures. The latter took the document in his hand, examined them closely, and then replied:</p>
                  <p>"I don't think I have the honor of an acquaintance with the signatures, sir."</p>
                  <p>Mark started in surprise, and his counsel also started at the witness, and dropped his indifferent air.</p>
                  <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5844-00000031"/>
                  <p>"Have you never seen those signatures before?" queried he, sharply.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I've seen 'em before," drawled the witness.</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir, no trifling with the court," sternly replied the counsel, casting also a look at the jury, as if to say, "You see he is an unwilling witness." Resuming the examination, he said to Clark:</p>
                  <p>"Tell the court and jury how you became acquainted with the signatures, and under what circumstances you saw them before."</p>
                  <p>"They were werry peculiar carcumstances," replied the witness, with another wink at Stanton, which this time escaped both Mark and his counsel's attention.</p>
                  <p>"Well, out with it," a little impatiently added the latter.</p>
                  <p>"The first time I see them signatures," answered the witness, holding them out before him and squinting at them with one eye, while he deliberately drawled his words. "Let's see, 'twas one day last week down in Mr. Brown's office—that covey sitting yonder," added the witness, stretching out his hand and pointing towards Brown, who, full of effrontery as he was, flinched under the sudden and unexpected observation drawn upon him. Mark grew black in the face with rage, and hastily whispered something to his astonished counsel. The latter immediately said to the witness:</p>
                  <p>"You may go down, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Stop," exclaimed Stanton, "I wish to cross-examine." Addressing the witness, he said:</p>
                  <p>"You say, you saw the signatures for the first time last week, in Mr. Brown's office. Who was present beside yourself?"</p>
                  <p>"The other chap over yonder, who's going to swear," replied the witness, pointing with his finger, "and Mr. Brown."</p>
                  <p>"For what purpose were the signatures shown to you?"</p>
                  <p>"So we should know 'em, of course, and could swear to 'em," said the witness.</p>
                  <p>"You were to be paid for this service?"</p>
                  <p>"Sartinly."</p>
                  <p>"You were to be paid, and the other witness you speak of, also for perjuring yourselves?"</p>
                  <p>"That's it, exactly; but we repented, you see," replied the witness.</p>
                  <p>"You have done well to do so," said Stanton. "Now, then, what did you say your name was?"</p>
                  <p>"Matthew Clark, sir," returned the witness, adding, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce,</foreign> and with a grimace which set the bar in a roar, "I'm kind o' ashamed of it, though."</p>
                  <p>"Did you never bear another name?"</p>
                  <p>Here Mark's counsel objected, saying that he could not see the object of this question.</p>
                  <p>"I wish to ask the witness some questions," said Stanton, addressing the court, "touching what he knows of the defendant's previous character."</p>
                  <p>The court intimated that he might proceed.</p>
                  <p>"I've had a good many names on occasions," replied the witness. "The prisoner there hired me once to call myself Seeley, and play father to a young lady who was going to marry his uncle."</p>
                  <p>Mark's face grew pale with anger and fear under this new revelation, and again his counsel interposed.</p>
                  <p>Stanton intimated that he had no more questions to ask on that subject, but proposed another.</p>
                  <p>"Do you, Mr. Clark, know anything about a marriage settlement purporting to have been made by the late Jacob Leavitt upon Maria Seeley, now his widow?"</p>
                  <p>Mark's counsel objected to this, also; but the court remarked that there seemed to have been an extraordinary amount of concealed villany practised by the prisoner, if the witness was to be believed, and he was willing to admit the answer, as showing his previous character, if that was the intention of the prosecutor. Stanton admitted that such was his purpose. The witness proceeded:</p>
                  <p>"I witnessed such a document."</p>
                  <p>"Made by Mr. Leavitt?"</p>
                  <p>"By the prisoner and his sister there," replied the witness, pointing at Mark and Ellen, who sat motionless in her veiled security.</p>
                  <p>"His sister!" exclaimed Stanton, unable to repress his astonishment and emotion. "His sister!"</p>
                  <p>Mark's counsel again rose to object that Miss Leavitt was not on trial, and therefore the evidence on that point should not be admitted; but before the words were out of his mouth, the answer came from the witness:</p>
                  <p>"Sartainly. Miss Ellen signed the young lady's, Miss Seeley's, name."</p>
                  <p>A murmur of execration passed around the audience, who were listening with breathless attention, and Stanton sank back in his seat and covered his face with his hands.</p>
                  <p>"My God," he muttered faintly, "what have I escaped!"</p>
                  <p>For a moment no one moved; the court, bar and audience, as well as the counsel engaged, were struck with astonishment. Ellen herself sat motionless as a marble statue, and Mark's face assumed a hardened and defiant expression.</p>
                  <p>The court inquired if the public prosecutor wished to ask the witness any further questions. Stanton signified that he did not, and the witness was allowed to go down.</p>
                  <p>A brief consultation passed between Mark and his counsel, which ended in the latter announcing that they would call no more witnesses. He rose, thereupon, and made a brief speech in defence; but brief as it was, it was evidently labored, and pronounced under a sense of the utter hopelessness of his client's case.</p>
                  <p>When he had done, Stanton rose. All eyes were eagerly fixed upon him, and even Ellen turned her head to get a full view of his face. It was calm and pale, but those near him remarked that his eyes flashed with deep and righteous indignation. He proceeded in a low, measured tone to make a brief review of the evidence, placing each point in its strongest light. As he advanced, his voice grew louder, and when he had finished summing up the evidence, he launched out into a strain of fiery invective and eloquent indignation at the long-practised and studied villanies of Mark; displayed his envenomed and heartless persecution of Maria, and drew such a beautiful picture of the latter under all her distresses, that many in the audience were affected to tears, and all, including the judge and the bar, listened with excited and breathless attention. He made only a brief but fiery allusion to the part Ellen had taken; with a proud delicacy, he did not mention her name, though the picture which he drew with a few masterly touches, needed no index to point out the character it represented. Even the cold and haughty Ellen quailed before the frightful daguerreotype of herself.</p>
                  <p>When Stanton sat down, the whole audience drew a long breath, so deeply had they hung upon his words. The jury consulted together but for a moment in the box, and immediately returned a verdict of guilty against Mark.</p>
                  <p>The court thereupon declared itself adjourned; and the venerable silver-haired Judge P——, the same who had made some time ago the prediction which will be remembered, descended from the bench, took Stanton by the hand, and expressed in the warmest terms the delight the young attorney's effort had given him.</p>
                  <p>"I am an old man," said he, "and I can occupy the bench but a little while longer at any rate; no matter, I shall resign, and use all my influence to have you appointed in my stead—no one could fill it with more distinction."</p>
                  <p>Stanton was naturally surprised at such a declaration, which seems romantic, and which he had no idea would be acted upon; but he acknowledged, as gracefully as he could, the compliment paid, and gathering up his papers left the court. As he did so, he encountered Old Sam, who had been an attentive listener, and whose rough sleeve had wiped the moisture from his eyes, as Stanton had spoken of his beloved mistress.</p>
                  <p>"God bless you, Mr. Stanton!" he said, his rough voice trembling a little with the ardor of his feelings. It was all he could find words to say.</p>
                  <p>We prefer not to follow Mark Leavitt in his punishment—Ellen in her disgrace. The former suffered just imprisonment; the latter was quietly allowed to dispose of her property, and to take up her departure for New York, to hide herself in the crowd, unpunished save by her conscience, and, what was more severe, her banishment from fashionable and respectable society. Her state waspitiful, spite of her wealth—we will not dwell on it.</p>
                  <p>Immediately after the trial, Stanton took measures to recover the abstracted funds belonging to Maria. It was not difficult. The full amount was lying to the credit of Mark in the Bank of England, and the proper proceedings soon placed it in Stanton's hands.</p>
                  <p>When this final result was attained, he called upon Maria to announce the fact, and to deliver over to her the voucher of his success. It was an afternoon similar to the one on which Maria had given him her decision upon his proposal.</p>
                  <p>"Now," said he, with a smile, which did not hide his ardent glance and fervid tones, "will you not permit me to worship the same sun which has received my lifelong orisons?"</p>
                  <p>Maria blushed, but did not reply. Unresisted, he passed his arm around her slender waist, and imprinted a warm, long-drawn kiss upon her lips.</p>
                  <p>"Now," he whispered in her willing ear, "now I am happy! What a long dream I have had!"</p>

                  <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5844-00000032"/>
                  <p>Let us draw the curtains over the felicity of pure love, which has suffered such sore trials, and is still pure and bright. The story is soon told.</p>
                  <p>Stanton and Maria were married with little delay or preparation; mere ceremony had no business to keep apart these lifelong lovers. At the altar, Maria was not less lovely than upon the other bridal; and O, how infinitely more happy and trusting! Her chastened heart felt now no ill-omened fears for the future—all was bright as the beautiful nuptial day.</p>
                  <p>Stanton re-purchased the mansion formerly owned by Mr. Laybach, restored them to their old home, and as they were growing old, and Maria desired it, the wedded pair also took up their residence with her foster parents.</p>
                  <p>Old Sam wanted no greater happiness than to be permitted to serve his former mistress; and took lifelong delight in nothing more than the relation of his famous exploit of capturing Mark, and his now master's great speech upon the trial.</p>
                  <p>Judge B——, on further reflection, did not carry out his romantic threat. But constitution-makers came before many years, and legislated him out of office, providing that judges should be elected by the people; and in his district Stanton's popularity was so great, that he was nominated and elected to the position which his old friend, Judge B——, predicted he would fill.</p>
                  <p>A happy life has a short history—it is told in a word. The after-life of Stanton and Maria belongs to this class. Have we said enough?</p>

               <head>THE LITTLE ERRAND BOY.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY MRS. CAROLINE ORNE.</head>
               <p>MR. CLINTON, a merchant of one of our larger cities, had finished business for the day, and had nearly reached home, when he found that he had left a couple of volumes of a new and highly interesting work, which, at her request, he had purchased for his daughter, lying on his desk in the counting-room. Knowing how disappointed she would be not to receive them,—the more so on account of her mother's temporary absence,—he turned in order to go back to the store and procure them, when he saw coming towards him a boy, whom he had for the last three months occasionally employed to do his errands.</p>
               <p>"Joseph," said he, "I want you to go to my store, and get a couple of books I accidentally left. You will find them laying on my desk, I believe,—if not, either of the clerks will find them for you."</p>
               <p>"Do you wish me to carry them to your house?" asked Joseph.</p>
               <p>"Yes. I shall be at home, and shall have a little change ready for you when you come."</p>
               <p>Joseph started for the store with much alacrity, for Mr. Clinton was in the habit of paying him liberally for doing his errands, and he was trying hard to obtain money enough to buy a new jacket, long and constant wear having made sad work with the only one he had. In a very short time—for Joseph had run most of the way, the books were lying on the centre-table in Mr. Clinton's drawing-room, and the little errand boy, with a twenty-five cent piece clasped tightly in his hand,—for he dared not trust to the integrity of his pockets,—started for home, if the wretched place, where, for half a dime, he was permitted nightly to sleep on a pile of straw, was worthy of the name.</p>
               <p>He had not yet left the handsome street where Mr. Clinton lived, when he met a man fashionably dressed, whom he remembered to have seen several times, sitting with Mr. Clinton in his counting-room. The man was walking hurriedly, and a minute before they passed each other, Joseph saw him tear off a portion of the outer covering of a small package, which he took from the inside pocket of his coat, and throw it on the pavement. Having done this, he smoothed and compressed the package into as small a compass as possible, and restored it to his pocket. The piece of paper, moved by the wind, fluttered close to Joseph's feet, as he approached the spot<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5844-00000033"/> where it lay. It reminded him that he needed the free use of both of his hands, having promised Mrs. Jukely, the woman where he lodged, that he would call at a place she had designated, and take with him a heavy basket of vegetables, in return for which favor she had promised to give him some supper. He, therefore, took up the piece of paper, which seemed to solicit his attention, and carefully wrapping it round the piece of money he had received from Mr. Clinton, with a pin, a goodly row of which, found during the day, garnished his jacket-sleeve, he fastened it inside of one of his worn pockets.</p>
               <p>"You told me you should be here a little arter six o'clock, and it's seven, every minute of it," said Mrs. Jukely, in an angry voice, as Joseph entered her subterranean abode, where she stood in the midst of a cloud of steam, emitted from a culinary preparation, and of an odor by no means unsavory to one whose appetite was sharpened by a nine or ten hours' fast. "In the half hour you've kept me waiting," she added, "I might have gone and fetched the basket myself, and as you've failed in keeping your part of the agreement, I aint bound to keep mine."</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry, but I met Mr. Clinton, and he wanted me to do an errand for him."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mr. Clinton is rich, and he must of course be waited on for all me. My time, which must be turned into bread, or the children will starve, isn't of any consequence compared with his, who hasn't but one child in the world, and has, as 'twere, a stream of Guinea gold flowin' in upon him from mornin' to night, and from night to mornin', without his liftin' a finger, as one might say."</p>
               <p>Joseph, while listening to this speech, had taken the quarter of a dollar from its many folded envelope, and deposited it in a small box, which he took from a cavity beneath one of the bricks composing the floor. He had kept his back turned towards Mrs. Jukely, for he did not care to have her see the box, or its contents, which, with the addition he now made, amounted to enough to purchase the new jacket. She saw that he took something from the piece of paper, which casting carelessly aside, fell on the heap of straw, where he slept. She sharply interrogated him, as to what the paper had contained.</p>
               <p>"Nothing of much consequence," was his answer.</p>
               <p>"I shouldn't wonder," said she, "if 'twas money, and that you stole it. It's no good sign to be so private about anything."</p>
               <p>Without making any answer to this, he remarked that if she did not intend to give him some supper, he must try and get some somewhere else, as he had had nothing to eat since the morning, and putting on his cap, he started to go out. But as he stepped from the door, she called him back. Having given vent to her ill-humor, her mood changed to one, meant to be particularly motherly and affectionate, which was manifested by her calling the little errand boy a poor, disconsolate orphan, and by patting the younger of her four dirty and ragged children on the head, which she shrunk from in a manner to show she was more accustomed to receive blows than caresses. It was not long before she contrived to elude them altogether by creeping close to Joseph, and half sheltering herself beneath the table, where he sat eating his supper. She then, clasping his left hand, which rested on his knee, in both of hers, leaned her head upon them, and soon fell asleep.</p>
               <p>"There, Mrs. Jukely," said Joseph, when he had finished eating, and as he spoke he took the sleeping child in his arms, "I've had enough to eat, and I thank you for it, and maybe, if nothing happens, I shall buy something for little Sue to-morrow."</p>
               <p>He rose, and gently placing the little girl on his own heap of straw, took off his jacket and lay down beside her.</p>
               <p>"What do you expect will happen?" said she.</p>
               <p>"Not anything, that I know of; but though I wasn't much bigger than little Sue when my mother died, I remember she used to tell me that nothing was certain."</p>
               <p>"She ought to have told you, that if ever you were left an orphan, to advise and plan with them that's older and more experienced than you are, and then if you had a little money, you wouldn't hide it away from one that's been a second mother to you, as 'twere—that is to say, if you come honestly by it."</p>
               <p>Joseph made no answer to this, for the shadows of Dreamland were gathering around him, softening the harsh tones of Mrs. Jukely's voice, so that they soon fell on his ear like a drowsy, monotonous chant, which gradually growing soft and aerial, it seemed in his slumber as if he were listening to one of the plaintive airs which his mother used sometimes to sing.</p>
               <p>While little Joseph was thus enjoying the sweets of repose, the man who threw the piece of newspaper on the pavement which he had appropriated, was seated in the drawing-room at Mr. Clinton's. Esther Clinton, a girl of seventeen, with a bright, rather than a strictly beautiful face, had just before his entrance, opened one of the volumes little Joseph had brought, and was about to commence reading aloud to her father. Esther, though she would have considered it unamiable to indulge such a feeling, was not, in her secret heart, well-pleased at the interruption; for although Mr. Ashby Hasler was said to be wealthy, and was, moreover, generally understood to be the brother-in-law of an English baronet, she had, from the first, disliked him, and always felt uncomfortable when in his presence. This might in part be attributed to the marked attention which he thought proper to bestow on her, whenever there was opportunity. The present evening—a circumstance so rare that it could scarce fail to excite observation—he seemed to be ill at ease. He was nervous and absent-minded. It might have been owing to some slight physical derangement. Whether caused by this or mental uneasiness, his strength of will was such as enabled him, in a short time, to assume his usual easy and nonchalant air.</p>
               <p>The clock struck ten, and Ashby Hasler rose to take leave, when a servant entered, and said something in a low voice to Mr. Clinton.</p>
               <p>"Tell him to come in here," said Mr. Clinton, and then, a little elevating his voice, he said: "Mr. Louden, step into the drawing-room if you please."</p>
               <p>Mr. Louden, who was a middle-aged man, and Mr. Clinton's confidential clerk, accordingly entered. He was a good deal agitated, and hesitated to speak, when he saw that Mr. Hasler was present. Hasler observed his hesitation, and made a motion as if to go.</p>
               <p>"Remain, Mr. Hasler," said Mr. Clinton. "I dare say there is nothing which need be concealed. Well, Louden, has anything happened?"</p>
               <p>"There has," he replied; "and something, which to me, seems very singular, as I had not been absent from the store a single minute after you left."</p>
               <p>"What is it?" Mr. Clinton inquired.</p>
               <p>"Your desk has been broken open, and the fifteen hundred dollars, in bank notes of one hundred each, which were to be paid to Mr. Watson in the morning, are gone."</p>
               <p>"That is indeed singular," said Mr. Clinton. "No one, to your knowledge, had entered the room, after I left?"</p>
               <p>"No one, except Joseph, the little errand boy, you sent for some books. He mentioned to me what he had come for, and as he had often been in the room where you left them, I told him he might go in and get them."</p>
               <p>"It cannot be possible," said Mr. Clinton, "that Joseph took the money. I never met with a boy more faithful, or who appeared more perfectly honest."</p>
               <p>Ashby Hasler smiled.</p>
               <p>"You don't agree with me," said Mr. Clinton.</p>
               <p>"Those little vagrants, who have to shift for themselves, almost as soon as they can walk alone, are a cunning set."</p>
               <p>"You think that little Joseph may be the rogue?"</p>
               <p>"He may be."</p>
               <p>"Louden," said Mr. Clinton, "how long should you say it was, after Joseph went into the counting-room for the books I sent for, before he returned?"</p>
               <p>"It would be impossible for me to say, sir, as I was extremely busy at the time; but I remember he was gone so long that I thought he must have had some difficulty in finding them."</p>
               <p>"There can be no doubt but that little Jo is the thief," said Hasler.</p>
               <p>"To me, there is," remarked Esther. "His face, though pale, and a great deal too full of care for one so young, looked to me like a good and honest one, and I am sure that the smile which passed over it like a sunbeam, when my father gave him a little more than he expected for bringing the books, could never have lighted up the countenance of one who had just been guilty of a great crime."</p>
               <p>"Your reasons for believing him innocent," said Hasler, "though quite poetical, would hardly be admitted as conclusive evidence in a court of law, yet I none the less congratulate you on your skill."</p>
               <p>He said this in a voice very softly modulated, though with a slight return of that unquiet look, which Esther had noticed at his first entrance. Mr. Clinton, who had been listening to the remarks which passed between Hasler and his daughter, now inquired of Louden if he noticed the manner in which the desk was broken open.</p>
               <p>"I did," he replied; "the lock was wrenched off."</p>
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5844-00000034"/>
               <p>"That must have required strength, and some ingenuity, I should think," said Mr. Clinton.</p>
               <p>"Less of either than might be imagined," Louden replied. "The lock, as you know, was on the outside of the desk, which is of soft wood. An incision was made with a sharp-pointed knife, at the edge of the lock, running so far underneath it as to permit it to be wrenched off with a piece of iron."</p>
               <p>"You are extremely particular in your description, sir," said Hasler, addressing the clerk. "As it is to be presumed you were not present, how should you know that a piece of steel, or even a piece of wood, was not used for the purpose of wrenching it off?"</p>
               <p>"Because," said Mr. Louden, producing a cylindrical piece of iron, flattened at one end, "as I found this lying on the floor, near the desk, I concluded it was the instrument made use of."</p>
               <p>"It was, undoubtedly," said Hasler, "and is, in my opinion, another proof that the boy sent for the books, is the thief."</p>
               <p>"Why so?" said Mr. Clinton.</p>
               <p>"In the first place, you perceive that the piece of iron is exceedingly rusty, as it naturally would be after lying in the gutter a few days, a receptacle, considered a kind of store-house by vagrants of every description."</p>
               <p>"How long was it after Joseph left, before you discovered that the desk was broken open?" said Mr. Clinton, addressing the clerk.</p>
               <p>"I knew nothing about it till it was time to close the store. I then took the key of the desk, which I found in its usual place, and went to see if you had removed the money to the iron safe."</p>
               <p>"I ought to have removed it—it was careless in me to leave it," said Mr. Clinton.</p>
               <p>"It was not strange, sir, that you should forget to remove it," said Louden, "as you know that I have duplicate keys, and never leave for the night without seeing that everything is safe."</p>
               <p>"Is it your opinion then that the little errand boy took the money?"</p>
               <p>"I hardly know what to say—appearances are against him," replied Mr. Louden.</p>
               <p>"You are certain that no one else went into the room after I left?"</p>
               <p>"Not to my knowledge, sir. Mr. Hasler, the gentleman present, is the only one who inquired for you after you went out. Do you think it best to let the matter rest till morning, sir?" said Louden, going towards the door.</p>
               <p>"We will speak together about it," said Mr. Clinton, and they both left the room.</p>
               <p>After an absence of about ten minutes, Mr. Clinton returned.</p>
               <p>"That fellow has been in your employ quite a number of years, I believe," said Hasler.</p>
               <p>"If you mean, Mr. Louden, he has been with me ever since I commenced business," was Mr. Clinton's reply.</p>
               <p>"You, of course, then, consider him faithful and honest."</p>
               <p>"I do, strictly so."</p>
               <p>"Yet it may not be amiss to keep an eye on him. Though by his appearance, one might judge that butter would not melt in his mouth, if I am not mistaken, he is a deep, cunning fellow."</p>
               <p>"How am I to understand you? Would you have me believe that he had anything to do with taking the money?"</p>
               <p>"Things as strange as that have happened," said Hasler.</p>
               <p>"I don't know if your reasons for thinking so are poetical or not," said Esther, demurely, "as you have not thought proper to name them; yet, to borrow your own language, I none the less congratulate you on your skill, in detecting in Mr. Louden's appearance, what has for so long a time escaped the penetration of my father, as well as all who are best acquainted with him."</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashby Hasler, in return, chose to bow and smile as politely as if he had received a genuine compliment, and finding that it was nearly eleven o'clock, he made some trite remark about the swiftness of time, when in agreeable company, and then took leave.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Long before there was any chance for a single sunbeam to find its way through the blurred windows of Mrs. Jukely's den-like apartment, little Joseph was partially roused from sleep by a strange voice speaking near him, in suppressed tones. When sufficiently wide awake to unclose his eyes, he saw by his dress that the owner of the voice was a policeman.</p>
               <p>"You say, when he returned last evening, that the first thing he did was to hide something away?" said Mr. Garson, the policeman, addressing Mrs. Jukely.</p>
               <p>"Yes, something that he took out of a piece of paper. Here is the very piece," said she, picking up that which lay at the edge of the heap of straw, where Joseph had thrown it.</p>
               <p>"Ah, this is something to the purpose," said the man, holding the piece of paper near the window, which enabled him to see that the name written on the upper edge, was "Samuel Clinton." "He hid what he took from it in this corner, I believe you said."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I thought he did; but though I searched and searched till I was tired, after he went to sleep, I couldn't find the least thing."</p>
               <p>The little errand boy, who had been listening with half-closed eyes, now recalled to mind what Mrs. Jukely had said about his dishonesty, which caused him to have a vague perception of what was going on.</p>
               <p>"I'll show you where it is," said he, suddenly rising from the pile of straw, and going to the corner which had been pointed out to the policeman, by Mrs. Jukely, he produced the box containing his carefully-hoarded treasure.</p>
               <p>"And is this what was wrapped in the piece of newspaper?" said Mr. Garson.</p>
               <p>"No, sir—none but the twenty-five cent piece. Mr. Clinton gave me that for carrying some books home for him."</p>
               <p>"And the piece of paper—did he give you that, too?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, I found it in the street."</p>
               <p>"Are you certain of that?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"You didn't mind, perhaps, that Mr. Clinton's name was written on it?"</p>
               <p>"No, I didn't," said Joseph, starting and changing color.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garson and Mrs. Jukely exchanged significant glances, which Joseph, though he did not exactly comprehend their meaning, imagined might imply doubts of his veracity.</p>
               <p>"I did find it in the street—I did, certain," said he. "I saw a gentleman throw it down, so I picked it up to wrap round the money Mr. Clinton gave me, to keep it from slipping, through the holes in my pocket."</p>
               <p>"That's a likely story," said Mrs. Jukely. "You must not mind half he says; he is—"</p>
               <p>"Having had some little experience in such matters, ma'am, I need no instruction as to what I must or must not do," said Mr. Garson, cutting her speech short with a sense of offended dignity.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jukely bit her lips, and her red face turned still redder.</p>
               <p>"Do you know the gentleman's name you saw throw away the piece of paper?" said Mr. Garson, turning to Joseph.</p>
               <p>"No, sir; but I'd seen him before a good many times."</p>
               <p>"Where?"</p>
               <p>"I have seen him at Mr. Hackett's auction-room, and I have seen him at Mr. Clinton's store; and in the room back of the store, talking with Mr. Clinton."</p>
               <p>"That will do," said Mr. Garson, as he carefully deposited the piece of newspaper in his pocket. "Now, Jo, put on your jacket, and go with me."</p>
               <p>"Am I going to be put in prison, sir?" said Joseph, looking very much frightened.</p>
               <p>"No, I rather think there is no danger of that, but as you may be wanted in the course of the day, you must be where I shall know where to find you."</p>
               <p>Poor Joseph's face brightened a little at this, but his hand trembled as Mr. Garson took hold of it to lead him away.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Mr. Clinton, while awaiting in the counting-room, the result of Mr. Garson's visit to Mrs. Jukely's, thought he would read the evening paper, which he merely glanced at the evening previous. He was surprised, and a little angry at finding that some one had carelessly torn off nearly one half of it. He would have complained to Mr. Louden about it, who entered a moment after he made the discovery, had he not seen by his looks that he had something to communicate, which he deemed of importance. Mr. Louden before he spoke, placed a gentleman's glove upon the table, by which Mr. Clinton sat.</p>
               <p>"I found it, sir, early this morning," said Mr. Louden, "lying on the floor, beneath yonder window. Just look at it, sir, and you will see that there are stains of iron-rust upon the inside."</p>
               <p>"There certainly are," said Mr. Clinton, examining the inside of the glove, which was a right hand one.</p>
               <p>"I think," said Mr. Louden, "that if we can find the owner of the glove, we shall find the thief."</p>
               <p>"There can be no doubt of it."</p>
               <p>"And it will not be the little errand boy, either."</p>
               <p>"No, I think not," was Mr. Clinton's reply.</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5844-00000035"/>
               <p>A few minutes afterward, Mr. Garson made his appearance.</p>
               <p>"What success?" inquired Mr. Clinton.</p>
               <p>"I believe I am on the right track."</p>
               <p>"Do you think so? Mr. Louden and I were just saying that we thought that Joseph was not the culprit."</p>
               <p>"And I agree with you," said Mr. Garson. "Ah," said he, the torn newspaper catching his eye, "perhaps I can supply what I see lacking here. No, only a part. Another piece is needed to make the paper complete."</p>
               <p>"You agree with us," said Mr. Clinton, "in thinking that little Jo is not the culprit?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And I understand you to say that you think you are in a fair way to apprehend the real one?"</p>
               <p>"I think I am. I have not yet ascertained his name, but I have a description of his person, and as he has been seen several times in your store, and in your counting-room, reading the papers, you or Mr. Louden may recollect him. I will read the description, if you please."</p>
               <p>"That applies to Ashby Hasler," said Mr. Clinton, when he had finished reading it.</p>
               <p>"Exactly," said Mr. Louden.</p>
               <p>"Ashby Hasler! Is he not the young gentleman who is just now making somewhat of a figure in fashionable society?"</p>
               <p>"The same," replied Mr. Clinton.</p>
               <p>"I've heard him mentioned, ugh being a little out of my beat, I've not as yet happened to get my eye on him."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible," said Mr. Clinton, addressing Louden, "that Hasler could have passed through the store into the counting-room, without being seen by you or either of the other clerks?"</p>
               <p>"I am certain that neither he nor any other person could have done it."</p>
               <p>Mr. Garson had in the meantime, approached a window.</p>
               <p>"He might have come in here," said he.</p>
               <p>"I cannot see how that could be possible, without the aid of a ladder," said Mr. Clinton.</p>
               <p>"On this nice piece of pine board, which lies so handily under the window. Even a tyro in the business—which I suspect this Hasler is not—could not wish to be better accommodated."</p>
               <p>"And the glove," said Mr. Louden; "it was close to this window that I found it."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Mr. Clinton, handing the glove to Mr. Garson.</p>
               <p>With the glove, the pieces of newspaper, and the piece of iron used to wrench the lock from the desk, Mr. Garson proceeded to the hotel, where Hasler boarded. He had not yet left his room, and though he told the servant that he was not ready to see visitors, Mr. Garson entered without ceremony. Whatever might have been Hasler's conjectures, as to the cause of this visit, he had the self-possession not to commit himself by manifesting any alarm.</p>
               <p>Almost the first thing that caught the policeman's eye on entering the room, was a glove lying on a table, which he knew must be the mate of the one Mr. Clinton gave him. On the same table lay a revolver, which quietly possessing himself of, he turned to Hasler.</p>
               <p>"You will consider yourself under arrest," said he, "but before you go, I'll thank you for the keys of your drawers."</p>
               <p>Hasler, who knew it would be perfectly useless to refuse the request, yielded the keys, and with a readiness, which made Mr. Garson doubt if they would give him access to what he wished to find. His doubts were somewhat strengthened, after vainly searching every drawer he could see in the room, of whatever description. He was not discouraged, and after a second and patient examination, in a drawer, furnished with one of those secret receptacles which none but a veteran in the business would thought of looking for, he found the fifteen one hundred dollar bank-notes, which had been taken from Mr. Clinton's desk.</p>
               <p>They were wrapped in a piece of newspaper, exactly what was wanting to complete the one in his possession.</p>
               <p>Hasler proved to be an old offender, and having undergone his trial, was doomed to expiate his crime by a return to the penitentiary, whence he had been absent only a few months.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Mr. Clinton, at the earnest solicitation of his daughter, gave a home to the little errand boy beneath his own roof. It was surprising what a change decent clothing and kind treatment made in his appearance. The thin, pale face, so sad, and so full of care, was overspread with the rosy hue of health, and in his large, dark eyes, the mournful expression so touching in childhood, gave place to those bright, sunny glances, which are kindled in the heart.</p>
               <p>During the long winter evenings which soon came, Esther often found a spare hour, which she delighted to devote to teaching him those primary ary branches of education, which would fit him to class with boys of his age, in some good school.</p>
               <p>One day, as Mrs. Clinton was passing his bedroom door, which had been left open, a small pearl box—the one Joseph had deposited so carefully beneath the brick, at Mrs. Jukely's, met her eye. It struck her that she had seen it before, which induced her to enter the room for the purpose of examining it. The lid was beautifully enamelled, and in the centre, inlaid with gold, were the letters J. M. They were the initials of a dearly beloved, though somewhat wayward brother, whose name was Joseph Moreton, and who, a number of years, previously, had been lost at sea. The box she had herself given him, as a birthday present.</p>
               <p>There had been a rumor that he left a wife at New Orleans, the port whence he sailed on his last fatal voyage, and Mr. Clinton at the time took measures to ascertain if the report was a correct one, but nothing which could be depended on, was elicited.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clinton since Joseph had been with them had frequently remarked to her husband and daughter, that he resembled her lost brother, and now, the thought struck her that he might be that brother's child. The boy, who had already been questioned as to his name, said that he did not remember ever to have been called anything except Joseph. Mrs. Clinton and Esther impatiently awaited his return from the store. When he at last came, in answer to the inquiries respecting the box, he said that his mother gave it to him a little while before she died, and that she told him that he must keep it as long as he lived, for it was one which had belonged to his father.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clinton did not entertain a doubt but that he was her nephew, and Mr. Clinton, pleased with his quickness, docility and faithfulness, willingly assented to the wish she expressed, of having him educated as such.</p>
               <p>Ten years afterward, Joseph Moreton worthily filled the place once held by Mr. Louden, who had long been in business for himself.</p>

               <head>TRIUMPH OF LOVE AND DUTY.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY MRS. E. WELLMONT.</head>
               <p>ALICE TUDOR was missing from her accustomed seat at her father's breakfast table. A messenger was despatched to inquire into the cause of this unusual event; but she wiped her eyes as she returned, bringing an answer that "Miss Alice begged to be excused, as the postman had just brought her a letter from Mr. Gordon." And while the father sits alone, eating an invalid's breakfast, which consisted only of dry toast and weak tea, we will notice the inmates which composed this household.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tudor was one of those uncertain ladies upon whom no dependence could be placed as to her appearing at the table or in the drawingroom. Weak, sensitive, nervously affected, full of strange fancies and odd whims,—indeed, one of those uncomfortable women, from whom some men would gladly be divorced were there a law upon the statute book in keeping with the wishes of their heart's secret. Not that Mrs. Tudor was exactly deranged,—because then she might have been sent to a lunatic asylum,—but that she was constantly demanding more of her husband and daughter than any sane woman could reasonably expect; herein lay the trial.</p>
               <p>Alice was an only daughter; Herbert, an only son, who was on a clerkship in a distant city, and two faithful domestics made the family to which we are now introducing our readers. But Alice Tudor was engaged to be married to Henry Gordon, a young lawyer of sound learning, good scholarship and fine expectations—being the son of an eminent banker, and an idolized child. The letter which she was reading when summoned to her morning repast, was the following:</p>

                           </opener>
                           <p>"MY DEAR ALICE,—I am about to address you under very peculiar circumstances. My father yesterday informed me that he could entrust to me a very lucrative business, which would <emph>carry me abroad and probably detain me there,</emph> if successfully carried on, for three years. Now I have no hesitancy in accepting this offer, provided you will join me as my travelling companion. To do so, we must, of course, be married—that we have been engaged quite long enough to warrant such a procedure, no one will deny, but that it will fall heavily upon your parents to part with one who so essentially contributes tributes to their pleasure and comfort, nay, even their life, I doubt not. But, Alice, we are liable to the crosses and changes of human condition. You have been so dutiful, so affectionate, so untiring in your devotion to your enfeebled mother and your invalid father, that I have long trembled lest you, too, should fall a prey to disease. This change may help to ward it off. An introduction to new scenes, a peep at Paris, a winter's residence in London, a glimpse of Germany, and perhaps a whole year in Italy, will be entirely en-route of my business, and such an opportunity where sight seeing can be procured at a comparatively small cost to us, seldom occurs. Do not stand at the proposal of an immediate marriage; do not plead that home duties must lead you to forego personal benefit. You are already <emph>mine,</emph> in a certain sense, and I claim the acknowledgment by the consummation of the marriage rite. In about a month it will be necessary we should depart, so you will break the matter to your parents at the earliest opportunity. I shall be with you in twenty days. Till then as ever your devotedly attached</p>

               <p>"Where's Alice?" inquired Mrs. Tudor. "I have had a night of extreme suffering; how little she regards my feelings. I declare, daughters now-a-days are dreadful selfish—I dare say she is doting over one of Henry's letters. By the by, Mr. Tudor, I shall never be reconciled to Alice's marriage with Henry Gordon—it must estrange her from us; taking such a position as she undoubtedly would, she will be in the whirl of fashion and devoted to luxurious entertainments. No, I cannot, Mr. Tudor, think of such an alliance, and I have a presentiment that unless we foreclose the matter soon, Alice will be beyond our control."</p>
               <p>"Why," said Mr. Tudor, "we cannot expect our children always to sit by our firesides—it would be selfish in us to demand it. You well know how attentively Alice has waited on us."</p>
               <p>"And why should she not, pray? Is it not the natural regard which ought to pervade a child's heart to obey the wishes of her parents? Think what <emph>I</emph> have done for Alice, Mr. Tudor. At her birth my life was despaired of; and what wearisome days and nights of anguish I encountered with her feebleness. She was the smallest pattern of a child that was ever reared to womanhood, and but for <emph>me</emph> she might have died in infancy; and does a mother's devotion never need to be repaid when her days of infirmity and depression of spirits fall upon her? Ah, talk of children's tenderness as you may, husband, they never can repay the parental obligation."</p>
               <p>"But, my dear, you are the only mother I ever knew who so rigidly observed the debt and credit system. Alice has always acquitted herself with the greatest affection to both of us. She has watched by our bedsides, ministered to our sinking spirits, and been a little angel to me in my trials. Sometime hence, it may be, she will be solicited to be married to Mr. Gordon, and I am sure I shall not withhold my free consent, and bless God, too, that such a worthy fellow has invited her to share his fortunes."</p>
               <p>"Well, I shall be laid in the peaceful grave, I humbly trust, before that event! Mr. Tudor, you speak of marriage as lightly as you would of making a deed, or writing a will, but you forget to put in the account the trouble which such an event entails upon a mother. What hurry and confusion always ensue previous to the ceremony; how much cutting and sewing, and planning and executing, must be done under one's roof. How my poor nerves would be taxed, how my head would ache, and my spirits droop at the thought that dressmakers and bridesmaids were to enter our quiet home; and then all this is only to take away our child, and leave us in our desolation. O, I never, never <emph>can</emph> endure it!" and a fit of hysterics being almost attendant upon such an anticipation in the prospect, Mr. Tudor left his wife, assuring her that what looked like a mountain in the distance often proved only an accessible hill upon nearer approach, and such might be the result of Alice's marriage.</p>
               <p>Alice met her father in his study as he entered it that morning, and gave into his hands the letter she had just received, then quietly shut the door and proceeded to her mother's chamber to receive a reprimand for her unaccustomed delay. We are acquainted with young ladies who would have felt, if they did not utter it, that a release from such a bondage would be a happy event; but Alice was so meek, so obedient, so studiously regardful of her mother's wishes, and so accustomed to feel that her own ought to be merged into the filial relation, that she only replied to her mother's irritability with a sweet smile and a mild excuse, hoping that she would be forgiven for so uncommon a delinquency, and then she adjusted her mother's robe, bathed her head, smoothed her pillow, gently moved about<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5844-00000037"/> and adjusted her chamber, and having administered her anodyne, quietly stole out from her room to her father's study. Have we many such specimens of affectionate love to parents, so unselfish, so unremitting?</p>
               <p>"Come in, my child," said Mr. Tudor. "Sit down, and let us talk over matters, my dear."</p>
               <p>There was something so soothing in this affectionate manner that Alice imprinted a kiss upon her father's check, and involuntarily sighed an "O, dear!" from her very heart.</p>
               <p>"So it seems," continued the father, "you are solicited, my daughter, to take a step which I hoped you would defer for a year or two longer. It takes me by surprise, and I hardly know what to say or how advise with you. That it will be a fine opportunity for you to travel, and that you are to be united to a man every way worthy your regard, I have no doubt—wealth, talent, position character, all, and as I could desire."</p>
               <p>"Only," said Alice, "please, father, transpose the qualities, and make character stand first, and wealth last in the scale of admeasurement."</p>
               <p>Mr. Tudor felt how well-timed was the suggestion, but it only confirmed to him that his daughter was an uncommon child.</p>
               <p>"But, Alice," he pursued, "there <emph>is</emph> one trial that awaits us, which I know not how to surmount."</p>
               <p>"You mean my mother's unwillingness that I should ever quit the parental roof; and father I feel it more sensitively than you can. Here lies my struggle with duty. To part with you who are so considerate of my wishes, is more than I feel able to do; but when I superadd my mother's disapproval, the thought of encountering all, and going to a foreign land, makes me—" and Alice fell upon her father's neck, and uttered no more.</p>
               <p>But true love has a mighty power which conquers all inferior sentiments, and it gives a confidence which enables one to triumph over the greatest difficulties, Before that interview ended, it was arranged that the father and daughter should disclose to the mother the present aspect of affairs, for they wisely concluded that when the mind is overwhelmed, the sooner it can be lightened of its load the better.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tudor's anodyne had comforted her to a quiet slumber, and she awoke calm and refreshed in her nervous temperament.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tudor and Alice sought her chamber, and divulged the whole affair. Sobs, tears, groans, sighs and exclamations followed, but they all ended in the positive assurance of the hysterical mother that "she should never live another month—that her strength was fast wasting, and her presence would soon be missed from among them." Short intervals of composure however intervened, sometimes rational glimpses seemed to gain the ascendancy—an acknowledgement that she ought not to stand in the light of her daughter's happiness occasionally became apparent to her, but generally the uppermost and prevailing thought was that "it was a mystery to her why she should be tried above the common lot of mothers;" why she was doomed to be forever the victim of disease, she could not tell; although her physician had again and again assured her by continually yielding to trifling pains, she had become the prey of disordered fancies, and it was only by assuming an energy and surmounting this unceasing attention to herself she could hope to be relieved. She had felt it was partly true from her own convictions, but she never openly declared them. She remembered long days when she once plied the needle, and varied her occupations by reading, walking, household duties and womanly cares; but those were days when their income was barely sufficient to meet their expenses, and her children were young, and a necessity seemed laid upon her to fulfil her allotted duties. Since then, Mr. Tudor had inherited a fortune by the death of his uncle, and gradually after she had relinquished her old pursuits, her interest in them became deadened, and then an assurance that there was no need of her applying herself to any particular labor, gave her a disrelish to do any, and by slow degrees a nervous debility had crept over her, she had magnified every small illness, and called a physician to every trifling symptom, which occupation would have banished far sooner than a Latin prescription. But so it was with Mrs. Tudor, and thus she fell a prey to those horrible fancies which altogether distance the real ills of life. Her increased property became an evil rather than a blessing; she was constantly devising means to feel happier, and thus lost all relish for the sources wherewith it could be extracted. She had tried foreign and home travel, had seen the world in all its varieties, had lived on the sea and the shore, in suburban cottages, and in stately palaces; had mingled in parties and partook of all kinds of festivities, and now after ten years' aim "to live more to her mind," and to feel happier, there she lay confined to one large airy chamber, brooding over fearful anticipations, changed in her disposition, petulant in her feelings, selfish in her purpose, really feeling she was uncared for when most faithfully tended, and never satisfied, so that her condition could not be improved, although, to a looker-on, she was blessed with all the heart could wish. In this state of disquietude, we can imagine the intelligence of her daughter's contemplated marriage fell upon her as a shock from which she did not desire to recover; but as she conversed with Alice, she could not discern there was anything unreasonable in her demands—she proposed to shield her mother from all trouble, and she only asked a private marriage and a quiet departure.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tudor could not find a friend but maintained that Alice was altogether reasonable and unselfish in her purpose; and for once she resolved—after a week's thought upon the subject—to make an effort to rally from her sick chamber and render some assistance in the hasty preparations. She knew she could be useful in the work of superintending her daughter's wardrobe, particularly for a foreign voyage, having once travelled the same route herself, and so upon a fine morning in June, when scarcely a leaf quivered, and all nature seemed clothed with foliage and laughing in the sunbeams, Mrs. Tudor proposed to Alice to order a carriage to be driven to make sundry purchases on her account. No doubt it proved a fatiguing process, for to one whose limbs have been so long paralyzed for want of exercise, any extra movement causes them soon to tire; but with the excitement which getting abroad furnished after six months in one heated apartment, the lassitude was overlooked for the time, and she "worried" through a great many purchases. But most unfortunately for her, the wind changed in a strong northeasterly direction while she was abroad, and this slight chill gave her a renewed certainty that she had not only "overdone," but that she had "actually taken cold!"</p>
               <p>The carriage windows were immediately shut, the large shawl was thrown across her shoulders, but the sun shone just as brilliantly as ever. Still, she had "overdone," and "she should be sick," was the unceasing lamentation to which Alice listened as they returned home.</p>
               <p>Once set ourselves resolutely about a thing, and it can be attained. Resolve to be sick, take to your bed, live on herb teas, shut out the light, send for a physician, and if you are <emph>rich,</emph> he will seldom tell you that only a fit of spleen has seized you, but he will leave a prescription, recommend quiet, call the disease by some name, and attend you—till <emph>you feel better.</emph> And this was just what happened in Mrs. Tudor's case—excepting she never grew better. Thus she lay, and it now wanted but a week to the time assigned for Alice's marriage.</p>
               <p>Henry Gordon had arrived in high anticipation, delighted with his choice, and feeling that nobody ever had so many graces personated in one as his lady-love—a sentiment which I believe is by no means uncommon at this particular crisis. He watched her untiring assiduity to please her parents, and the martyrdom with which she surrendered every pleasure on account of her mother, and he longed to release her from such duties, when, lo! the next morning it was announced that Mrs. Tudor had taken an emetic, and during its operation a blood vessel had burst, and she lay in a swoon saturated with its copious discharge!</p>
               <p>Alice and her father were summoned to her bedside, feeling, indeed, that this might be the termination of her unhappy life. The physician gave it his opinion "it was a doubtful case, but with the utmost care and unremitting attention he hoped for the best."</p>
               <p>And what was to become of Henry Gordon and Alice? Their marriage was fixed for the Thursday following. Here was her invalid father, a sick mother, who, perhaps, would not survive a month—could she leave them in the care of a strange nurse, and commit herself to the merciless waves as a new wife, with such a saddened heart?</p>
               <p>And there, too, was young Gordon—obliged to sail in the next steamer. His business was of that character it could admit of no detention. Clinging devotedly to Alice as his richest freight, comforting her with assurances that her efforts could, and ought, and must be dispensed with, until within twenty-four hours of the time of his marriage, when the over-wrought, over-tasked frame of Alice yielded to a fitful fever, and his hopes were blasted beyond all power of description. The nature of Alice's disease was such that to converse with her before a separation was impossible—indeed, she early grew delirious, fancying herself upon shipboard, and calling loudly upon Henry to protect her from being engulfed in the waves, thus showing how deeply at<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5844-00000038"/> the citadel of life her anxieties had preyed upon her in secret. No one saw Henry Gordon depart; it was supposed he left the house at midnight, and engaged a postman from a neighboring city to bear him away without a single adieu to the stricken Mr. Tudor, which weighed heavily upon his mind long afterwards. Alice's sickness was severe, and strong doubts were entertained whether she would recover, and if so, whether her reason would ever regain its former strength. But "He who so often tempers the wind to the shorn lamb," kindly took charge of this loved one, and raised her from suffering and extreme debility, to comprehend the nature of her disease, and to induce a perfectly resigned state of mind with all the appointments of her lot. If there ever was a child who never needed what is technically called "a conversion," it was Alice Tudor—for she seemed sanctified from her birth. It was instructive to hear her reason, as she was recovering, upon the mercies rather than bitter experiences which had befallen her.</p>
               <p>"Had I but have been married, and been seized with the malady I have just encountered on board a steam-ship," said she, "how certainly I should have died. Besides, what could a young husband know of nursing, and how would the intelligence of my death have fallen upon my parents?" And then she would revert to the thoughtful character of Henry, who left upon his table the morning he departed, the following affectionate note, addressed to herself:</p>

                           <p>"MY DEAREST ALICE,—My brain is on fire, my thoughts, I cannot command them. I feel as if on the verge of despair. My disappointment you cannot realize. God grant you may survive that I may feebly describe it to you. I have listened to your incoherent remarks the last night, and am full of painful misgivings, lest I have proposed too much and taxed you so heavily as to induce this disease. But, Alice, let us hope. Should you recover, we shall yet be united—the bonds of affection receiving a new rivet by this chastisement. You perchance will cross the water and allow me to meet you there, when we will have our nuptial rites performed in some English chapel. But enough—I go from dire necessity, and what a conflict! You will hear from me by return of the next steamer, after my arrival, and you can conceive with what solicitude I shall await the tidings from yourself. This note is designed for Mr. Tudor, should any sad event prevent her to whom it is addressed, from perusing it. With an unsteady hand, but a devoted heart, I am wholly yours,</p>

               </q>
               <p>That Alice was so far recovered as to be able to answer this note in her own hand writing was an inexpressible satisfaction to both parties. And now that Mrs. Tudor was slowly recovering and her father was no worse, Alice felt she had a great deal to call forth her devout gratitude; and if words were not always upon her lips, the sentiment always pervaded her heart. How far she was removed from an angel we cannot here tell, but as spiritualists would say, she was evidently fitted for "a different sphere" from any one we had chanced to know.</p>
               <p>Time now stole away in such varied duties and constant occupations, that soon a year had elapsed since the dreadful day of Henry Gordon's departure. Letters were constantly received by every steamer, confirming his love and constancy, and hoping she would obtain the consent of her parents to meet him in Liverpool, as it was impossible for him to absent himself long enough to return for her; and to obviate all delicacy and feeling of desolation, his father and sister proposed to accompany Alice whenever her parents' consent could be obtained. But a real serious illness had more and more shattered Mrs. Tudor's nervous system, and Alice was an indispensable companion at her bedside. Indeed, she would permit no conversation, in her presence, upon the subject of her marriage, affirming only, "After I am dead it will be time enough, child, for you to assume such important trusts as that relation imposes. Look upon your poor mother, and see what domestic anxieties have done for <emph>her.</emph> See my wrinkled brow and premature decay. Once, Alice, I was blithe as yourself, but my physical energies were overtasked."</p>
               <p>Such was her reasoning, and so long had she appeared to believe in the truth of what she first knew to be a falsehood, what we may charitably infer at length to her diseased vision it appeared a reality—for the mind may be cheated to believe almost any idle fancy after dwelling upon it for a length of time.</p>
               <p>Alice, therefore, had but little sympathy in her loving regards to Henry, only as her father kindly inquired particularly about him as his letters were duly received. Her mother was never able to hear them read.</p>
               <p>It was difficult to conceive how such unceasing efforts to please so sensitive a mother could be maintained; but a strength of principle underlaid these attentions, almost superhuman. Alice never complained; her father and she never conversed upon her mother's whimsical movements, but wisely concluding, as all sensible people should, that no amendment of such a trial is induced by the retrospect of what is so hard to endure, they shunned all comments, and conversed only upon loftier subjects than the frailty of humanity.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>At length intelligence was received that Henry Gordon had gone to Italy to pass a year. Thus far he had maintained all the devotion which could have been expected from an absent lover; but now there seemed a long interval between his letters—they were of a more descriptive character, filled with admiration of natural scenery, expatiating upon "golden sunsets and lovely prospects," but not so heart-felt and sympathetic, and fresh from the soul's inner depths—such, in fine, as a true lover always embodies in sentiment, let him write ever so laconic or lengthy an epistle. There is always a chord which vibrates to a corresponding one between two pledged hearts, and if you trace it nowhere else, the beginning or close of every letter convinces the one addressed that they are all in all to each other.</p>
               <p>It was not so now with Henry Gordon; yet Alice, if slow to detect the change, was equally so to acknowledge it. Still, her fancy was always busy in the future, and there was no future in which her lover was not associated with <emph>her</emph> plans and pleasures. But one year more, and she felt that there would be a change; but a very different one succeeded from any of her preconceived ideas.</p>
               <p>Young Gordon had been scarcely three months in Italy, before another vision of angelic beauty flitted before him. Whether time deadened his sensitive nature, or cooled his ardent love, or he felt that Alice Tudor could not be wedded for many weary years, or whether this new being had rekindled the fires of affection, or his nature had changed by being thrown into every variety of society, and his principles become less firm to those solemn pledges of love towards Alice, is still left for us to conjecture. We are only furnished with his version of the tale which was drafted into a precise epistolary form, and directed to Alice Tudor. It ran on this wise:</p>

                           <p>"DEAR ALICE,—I ought to have acknowledged your letter some weeks since, but my plans and purposes have become so changed in that time, I have delayed to do so. I scarcely know how to indite what my conscience now prompts me to add, but I may as well be brief and tell you. I have pledged my hand and heart to a beautiful Italian maiden. There was, dear Alice, so much uncertainty hanging over <emph>your</emph> destiny; you refused so continually to leave the parental roof, lest you should inflict too severe a pang upon its inmates, that I at length concluded it was best not to alter your purpose, and so I have spared you the trial. The lovely being to whom I am engaged is one of the sweetest vocalists in the world—the child of song and sentiment, captivating in manners, lovely in features, graceful, polished, and altogether, charming. She reminds me often of my American Alice, whom I can no more embody in my conceptions as <emph>mine.</emph> I have dreaded to make this avowal to you, well knowing how you will regard me as fickle and inconstant. Perhaps I merit the charge, but Heaven knows I shall always implore upon you the choicest benedictions. We shall be married before this intelligence can reach you. Henceforth our correspondence must cease, but should we ever cross each other's pathway in this life, let us meet in the spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness—as hearty friends whom the adverse stream of Time precluded from sailing down the voyage of life together. Thus prays, and thus closes he that <emph>was</emph> your lover, and is now your <emph>true friend.</emph>

               <p>When Alice Tudor received the above letter she neither fainted nor wept, grew hysterical nor frantic; but a deep shadow passed over her countenance which no sunlight nor social circle again irradiated. She grew more and more thoughtful, and, if possible, more solicitous to perform her personal and parental duties than ever; her heart expanded to the claims of others with a quickened perception; she gave full evidence of a Christian triumph over wounded affection. Deeply, indeed, did she feel bereaved; long would she miss that sustaining solace which Henry's letters afforded. Many months would elapse ere she would feel she had no claim upon his love; but she neither criminated nor censured his course—she tried rather to rejoice that he was about to be made happy, and such an instance<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5844-00000039"/> stance of pure disinterestedness is not often recorded.</p>
               <p>She thought of the "Italian nightingale," and regretted that <emph>her</emph> soul was never attuned to song; she trusted Henry would be happy, and as to herself, why, a consciousness of having performed her duty and maintaining a Christian deportment, would make her endure without much intense suffering. Thus she reasoned; but, alas! sometimes a feeling of loneliness, a void, a blank, seemed to be stamped upon her life.</p>
               <p>At length her mother began to decline more rapidly, and greater exertions to sustain her sinking spirits than ever fell upon Alice—for her mother, the sufferer, and Alice, the patient endurer, were destined to part. But before she died, Mrs. Tudor seemed awakened to a sense of the sacrifice her daughter had endured in her behalf, and she called her to her bedside, and smoothing the soft locks and glossy ringlets which clustered about her daughter's forehead, she said:</p>
               <p>"My child, you have been to me a rare gift. I may have seemed insensible to your devoted care, but the infirmities of the flesh have made me petulant and fault-finding. You have been gentle and dutiful; but we must separate. Alice, <emph>you will yet marry Henry Gordon.</emph> Strange visions floated before me last night—instead of a shroud, I saw a festive party returning from a wedding tour, and I looked and I saw my Alice. You were clothed in a robe of pure white, and a crown of diamonds encircled your head. I seemed to bend from an archway, whereon the most beautiful flowers were intermingled with olive leaves of surpassing greenness. Through that arch you stepped into a cathedral, and close behind you followed your father and the officiating priest. The door closed, and a spirit murmured, 'She has triumphed—her cross is exchanged for a crown.' My child, I am no superstitious believer in dreams, or the visions of the night, but a strange vividness was attached to this, and it seems to import a reality you will one day witness. May I, in my heavenly home, recognize the fate of my child!"</p>
               <p>Alice made no reply. She felt a hallucination had taken possession of her mother's mind as her spirit was about ascending; so she wiped the death-damp from her forehead, pressed her attenuated hand, and breathed a last farewell.</p>
               <p>Herbert, the only son had now arrived; but his mother was dead, and Alice turned from her cold embrace to offer a sustaining word to her brother and father; and so completely was she occupied in duties or household cares, that only at intervals could she recall that singular dream, and then sighed that it was <emph>but a dream,</emph> which a roving fancy in glancing over the past and looking into the future, shot through a bewildered brain.</p>
               <p>Herbert first learned upon this visit that the engagement between young Gordon and his sister was dissolved, and with an ardent impetuosity of manner, he desired revenge. Indeed, it was with difficulty he could be restrained from sending him an epistle demanding satisfaction for the injury he had inflicted upon his sister; but here the mild restraint and the ready excuses with which Alice glossed over Henry's conduct, gradually calmed the fevered brow and allayed her brother's frenzy. Would that such sisters often dwelt beneath the household roof, amidst the wild and turbulent race of brothers.</p>
               <p>For some months Mr. Tudor and his daughter remained in quiet. Not that Alice became a recluse—O, no. There were sick beds beside which she watched; there were suffering hearts she comforted, and poor forsaken wanderers whom she brought back to the fold. Besides, there was her father, who seemed to rally since his wife's decease, and in a measure to overcome his invalidism. But the incipient seeds of disease seemed to be sown in the slender form of Alice. She grew wearied, and sometimes a sad countenance attested she was a silent sufferer. Then it was proposed that she should try the effect of a change of clime, and her father gladly accepted the proposition on his own as well as his daughter's account.</p>
               <p>A foreign voyage was undertaken the following spring, and Alice had a desire to visit the country upon which her former lover had so glowingly expatiated. From London they proceeded to Germany, then a violent cough seized her father, and medical men ordered them to the south of France. Here the health of both became so improved that the next winter they proposed to remain in Rome—and Alice did sometimes think it would be a strange coincidence if she should there meet Henry Gordon. The winter, however, wore away, and she saw him not. Toward spring, she travelled through the country. In one of those conveyances so peculiar to that country, she met several Americans. They were immediately at ease and acquainted, as if old friends. Conversation was varied. At length an elderly gentleman remarked to his friend:</p>
               <p>"Yes, she died last spring—a frail flower. Her monument has a sculptured rose-bud, bent, but not wholly riven from the stalk."</p>
               <p>This led to a more general opinion as to what such an emblem could mean. One surmised one thing, and another another, but Alice gave it as <emph>her</emph> opinion that the bereaved husband intended it as a link which time would not break asunder, and which Eternity would reunite. There was something so beautiful in the thought that it was dwelt upon, and at length Alice remarked:</p>
               <p>"Did I know the character of the survivor, I could at once tell whether my idea is correct."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," said the old gentleman, "you may have heard of him. He is an American—a rare fellow, somewhat pensive, a little abstracted in manner, but genial in soul. His name is <emph>Gordon</emph>—<emph>Henry Gordon,</emph> I think. We shall meet him at the next inn. I have business to arrange with him by appointment!"</p>
               <p>No one remarked that Alice quivered; no one saw that large drops of perspiration stood upon her face, and that she applied cologne to her head. Her father was outside the coach, and on they rode until they arrived at the inn, where Henry Gordon stood upon the threshold, ready to meet his business friend.</p>
               <p>Alice had dropped her thick veil, but her father's face was not to be mistaken—Mr. Tudor, Henry Gordon and Alice had recognized each other! What they uttered, and how they expressed themselves, the Italian group neither knew nor cared; but you and I, gentle reader, will follow them to a quiet apartment, where the past is made present, where bereavements are recounted, and reunions are realized, and that night think you the dream of the dying mother did not occur to Alice? Or rather can you believe the thought of anything else, but its import? Did not Henry Gordon's last letter suggest "if they should ever meet again on earth, it might be in the spirit of forgiveness and reconciliation?" How strangely had. Providence marked out their courses! Could they be hostile to each other? Had they not already breathed again their old vows, and exchanged renewed pledges of love? The Italian songstress—the frail flower—had been cherished and had gone. A desolate heart was left, but never had a forgetfulness of her who was first adored, been estranged from his affection! He felt he deserved her not; he ought to pass from earth unwept; there was a deep penitential feeling that he deserved to be chastened for compromising with duty, and yielding to temptation, and bantering with affection. Perhaps no crime which a high-minded man commits, is ever followed by such a sense of degradation as that which stigmatizes him for having deceived and cruelly thrown from his embrace the heart he had won to love and confidence. Well is it, if he is ever again proffered the same affection. Here was a signal event. Alice's heart had never grown cold—never trifled with another; it would be more than human to expect she could resist the persuasions of her old lover to be restored to her confidence, for there was no indifference to be contended with.</p>
               <p>Henry Gordon had gathered about him the best society of the country. His position, talents, wealth, were all one could desire—only one stain rested upon his character, and Alice forgave him <emph>that.</emph> Her father, too, received him just as his daughter desired; and what remained but to consummate the union?</p>
               <p>It was a bright morning in June—just such a one as three years before when Mrs. Tudor and Alice were preparing for the same ceremony, that Henry Gordon and Alice Tudor entered the cathedral where their marriage was to be solemnized. The father lingered a few paces behind with the priest; a brilliant crown shone upon the head of the fair bride. There was an archway through which they entered, surmounted with a wreath of flowers. Solemn words were said, mutual vows exchanged, and fervent benedictions were breathed, and with tearful eyes the father of Alice comprehended all by simply adding:</p>
               <p>"My child, I have witnessed the triumph of duty and love!"</p>
               <p>Alice looked up into the deep, blue vault of heaven as she came out the happy bride. A fleecy cloud was irradiated by a splendid sun. <emph>She thought of her mother's dream,</emph> and went on to receive the congratulations of a large assembly of friends who had prepared to welcome her as Mrs. Henry Gordon!</p>
               <p>Can you believe any more clouds ever darkened her pathway? Yes, there were shadows—because so long as we are mortal, an eternal sunshine will not gild every enjoyment. Mr. Tudor's health began again to sink. Alice travelled with him. Then she surrounded him with the comforts of a true American home, while<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5844-00000040"/> abroad; but his wasted frame sank at length, and he died in the arms of Henry Gordon, breathing out a blessing upon his household. His remains rest in the same cemetery with his wife; and Mr. and Mrs. Gordon are the most devotedly attached couple it has ever fallen to our experience to behold.</p>
               <p>Thus, truly, have love and duty triumphed in the wife, while, as if desirous to make amends for former neglect, the husband spares no effort to distinguish himself as the model of a sincere, unaffected, worthy partner to her whom he designates as his "ministering angel."</p>
               <p>Herbert Tudor is soon to be married to the sister of Henry Gordon, and upon the consummation of the rite, it is their intention to make a foreign tour, where their brother and sister will receive them with open arms, and present to them a little flaxen-headed boy, six months old, who is called Charles Herbert Tudor, thus extending the names of his grandfather and uncle to another generation.</p>
               <p>May the shadows of earth fall lightly upon a group whom we leave irradiated by affection; and when the dark clouds shall obscure the brilliancy of the sun that now shines upon them, can we doubt that the softening influence of that Christian faith, which enabled the wife of Henry Gordon to triumph over all the discouragements which love and duty threw in her earlier pathway, will diffuse its hallowed teachings among those over whom the horizon of earthly prospects may be temporarily obscured—for she will lead them unto the true fountain of all consolation.</p>

               <p>"AND is it my lot always to toil thus unceasingly?" said John Ellsley. "Except that I am guilty of no crime, I am little better off than the prisoner." And as the poor operator of a silk mill uttered these words, half aloud, half to himself, he brushed back from his brow the brown and slightly curling hair, damp with perspiration.</p>
               <p>He looked pale, languid and weary, but the unceasing motion of the machinery, with its incessant clang and clatter, told him there was not a moment for rest. It was not long, however, before his large hazel eyes, which had looked dim and expressionless, began to light up with a dreamy lustre, and gradually a faint flush broke over his pale cheeks. At the same time his lips parted with a smile, singularly sweet and radiant. Still he continued to bend over his task, which his hands mechanically and with unerring precision performed. But his mind was not there. He had seldom, for many years, beheld the blue sky, except in small patches, or narrow strips, framed in by the roofs of the tall buildings, and half blotted out by the smoke, which rose upward in black and lazy volumes. More seldom still had he seen the hill and the stream glow and sparkle in the golden glories of morning and the brilliant hues of evening, or listened to the melody of woodland birds. But now they came back to eye and ear. He no longer saw the dark and dingy walls which enclosed him on every side; he no longer heard the harsh and dissonant sounds. He was wandering over the breezy hills where he roved in early boyhood, and only heard a gush of song, clear and silvery, such as used to come down to him from the sky-lark when he watched its upward flight, till it would have been lost to his eye, had it not been for the sunlight that brightened its wings.</p>
               <p>The toil was unheeded now—the weariness and languor all gone. Nothing, save what was bright and fair, had power to enter the magic realm, with which imagination had surrounded him.</p>
               <p>It was near dark when he left the factory. As he was proceeding homewards, a little boy, not more than three years old, jostled by some one who was hurrying heedlessly along, fell at his feet. He stopped and raised him from the ground.</p>
               <p>"Are you hurt, my little boy?" said Ellsley,<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5844-00000041"/> kindly; but the child, instead of answering, said in a voice broken by sobs:</p>
               <p>"I want Nora—where's Nora and little Eva gone?"</p>
               <p>"Who is Nora?" said Ellsley.</p>
               <p>"She takes care of little Eva and me, and puts me to bed, and sings to me."</p>
               <p>"And your mama—where is she?"</p>
               <p>"Gone."</p>
               <p>"Where is she gone?"</p>
               <p>"Off—off—away off," said he, making a motion with his hands to indicate the greatest possible distance he was capable of comprehending. "Nora says she'll never come back again to see Charley and little Eva."</p>
               <p>"Well, my little boy, it is so dark now that I am afraid Nora wont be able to find you to-night. I will take you home with me, where you can go to bed and sleep till morning."</p>
               <p>"And who'll sing to Charley?"</p>
               <p>"Mary will sing to you;" and resting the child's head against his shoulder, he resumed his walk towards home.</p>
               <p>He had proceeded scarce a dozen paces, when he found that he had fallen asleep; yet still there would, now and then, a low, convulsive sob come up, as it were from the very depths of the little fellow's breast. In a few minutes Ellsley arrived at a large, dingy-looking building, which he entered, and having ascended to the third story, proceeded along a narrow corridor. His coming had been watched for by the occupant of one of the apartments, and he had not gone half the length of the passage, when a door near the further extremity was thrown open, and a young woman, neatly dressed, and with a countenance expressive of quiet happiness, held forward a light, which enabled him to see the way.</p>
               <p>"Why, John," said she, as he approached the door, "what child is that?"</p>
               <p>"One that seems to have got lost. When I came across him he was all alone, and crying bitterly. He soon dropped asleep after I took him in my arms."</p>
               <p>"Poor little follow," said she. "Only see—the tears are still wet on his cheeks. What a sweet face—and his clothes are so pretty and nice, we may be sure that he doesn't belong to poor laboring people, like us. Here, John, lay him on sister Letty's bed, but first let me take off his cap. See the beautiful bright curls that are peeping from beneath it."</p>
               <p>Ellsley placed him gently on the bed, and Mary, his <unclear>wife</unclear>, wiped the undried tears from his soft, round cheek, which, bitter as his grief had been, looked fresh and blooming as a wild rose, as it rested on the white pillow.</p>
               <p>"How strange that those who had the care of him should be so careless as to let him get lost," said Mary.</p>
               <p>They both stood by the side of the bed watching him for a few moments.</p>
               <p>"It is a sweet face, as you said, Mary," said Ellsley, "and brings to me sweet fancies, such as I used to have when a boy,—I was then surrounded by breezy hills, instead of brick houses,—of cherubs floating on the gold and amber clouds of sunset. Yet, after all, they were not sweeter than they are now, when we sit together in our snug, quiet room, which you know, Mary, is our fairy ring."</p>
               <p>The young wife smiled at these words, and bending over the sleeping boy, touched her lips to the white forehead, where wandered the delicate tracery of the blue veins. She then drew the white curtain before the recess containing the bed, and after Ellsley had lingered a minute longer to look at some beautiful and elaborate embroidery, by which Mary daily earned a few pence, they took their places at the table.</p>
               <p>It being Monday, in addition to the bread and the tea—the last worthy of the china cups—there were a few slices of cold beef, left of their Sunday's dinner. Ellsley, with the keen appetite produced by labor, did not care for anything better, and as he sat eating and sipping his tea, and looked round and saw how nice and tidy everything looked, he thought of the discontent in which he had indulged only a few hours before.</p>
               <p>"Mary," said he, "I felt unhappy this afternoon—discontented with my lot."</p>
               <p>"What made you, John?" she asked, with a look of some surprise.</p>
               <p>"There was such a longing came over me to have the leisure to mould into form the bright thoughts and fancies which haunt me, so that I might throw a few flowers on life's swift current, that others who labor as we do might gather them up and look at them, and be cheered by their humble beauty, that I gave way to bitter repinings—the chain that binds me to incessant labor grew so heavy and galling that my heart sunk within me, and I thought I might as well die. Then my thoughts turned to you, Mary, and though I knew that you have a brave and cheerful heart, as well as willing hands, I knew also that those hands which now are so nimble at the embroidery, and so ready to perform all needful labor, might one day falter in their task, and that the few hard-earned pence which it now gives you, would grow fewer, and at a time when the strongest arm you now lean upon, could no longer sustain you."</p>
               <p>"We will hope that the dark day wont come. As you say, it is only a few pence which I can daily earn, but those few, now that we've got everything so comfortable round us, I can lay by for a time when we may need them more. It is only when I think of you that I feel sad. It is so hard that you cannot have a little time to yourself."</p>
               <p>"Don't mind, Mary—it is not often that I feel so disheartened as I did this afternoon."</p>
               <p>"Who knows, John, but that the little boy you brought home with you, will in some way be the means of bringing us better fortune."</p>
               <p>"If his friends cannot be found, he will make your task harder."</p>
               <p>"And there will be a little more bread to buy, which will take what I earn by my embroidery. But I shan't mind—his sweet face will cheer me, and make those long days pass pleasantly while you are absent."</p>
               <p>Ellsley fully expected that there would be inquiries for the child in the morning, by whoever might have the care of him, but none were made, and those he was able to make himself resulted in nothing satisfactory. A woman who listened to his description of the little boy, said it applied to one she saw lifted into a hackney coach, near the railway station, the preceding day, and that she heard some one, who was already in the coach, call him Charley. She also heard a few words, addressed to the driver of the coach, by which she concluded that the passengers wished to be taken to some packet or steamer. When he went home to dinner, he found that his wife and little Charley were already good friends.</p>
               <p>"Well," said Mary, having listened to the vague information, which was the result of her husband's inquiries, "we will keep him till some one appears, who has a better claim to him than we have."</p>
               <p>"I have been advised to place him in some asylum," said Ellsley.</p>
               <p>"I cannot think of such a thing, John."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear you say so. He would be well cared for, I am told; yet I am afraid it would be a very different kind of care from what he has been used to. In less than a month's time the sunshine would be all gone from that bright, sweet face."</p>
               <p>"And it is just the kind of sunshine that warms and cheers the heart. No, John, we will not part with him. If my cares increase, they will be such pleasant ones that my courage to work will increase still more than they will."</p>
               <p>"Yes, his presence already makes our fairy ring brighter and more luminous."</p>
               <p>"I almost begin to dread the thought of hearing from the child's friends," said Mary. "You may bring news from them the next time you come home."</p>
               <p>"I don't think I shall," he replied, going. "If they had been in the city, I could hardly have failed to hear from them before now."</p>
               <p>Ellsley had been gone only a few minutes, when Mary's sister Letty called. She was a pretty, sprightly girl of eighteen, though she looked two years younger. She came dancing into the room, but so lightly that Mary, who sat with her back towards the door, did not know that she had entered. She stopped short when she saw a child sitting on her sister's lap, who was listening with delighted attention to some old nursery rhymes, which Mary was singing, or rather chanting to him, in a low, sweet voice. Charley, who caught a side glance of Letty, exclaimed in joyful accents, as he quickly slid from Mary's lap, "Nora's come! Nora's come!" But the sudden glow of pleasure faded from his countenance, when he obtained a full view of her face.</p>
               <p>"No, it is Letty that's come," said the young girl, springing towards him with open arms.</p>
               <p>He stole a look at Mary, and the manifest pleasure with which she regarded the new comer, inspired him with confidence, and he yielded to her embrace.</p>
               <p>"What a lovely child!" said she, kissing his rosy cheek. "How came he here?"</p>
               <p>"Have you not heard?"</p>
               <p>"No; and how should I, when I've been absent almost a week."</p>
               <p>"I thought you might have seen John, or some of the factory girls."</p>
               <p>"No, I've seen no one. I came directly here as soon as I arrived."</p>
               <p>When Mary had told her all that she knew about little Charley, after sitting silent a few minutes, while a mingling of joy and sadness stole over her countenance, she said:</p>
               <p>"Well, Mary, it's all settled at last."</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5844-00000042"/>
               <p>"Do you mean that James Harford has concluded to go to America?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," and her cheeks grew redder as she spoke—we are to be married four week from to-morrow, and expect to sail the next day."</p>
               <p>"Will his sister go with you?"</p>
               <p>"No, which makes me the more wish that you and John were going."</p>
               <p>"I wish we were, and we may some day, though we cannot go just now."</p>
               <p>"I shall tease John, till he gives me his promise. James don't intend to settle down in a city. He means to buy a farm in some place where land is cheap, for he says it will be so much pleasanter after being shut up in a close factory, where every after being shut up in a close factory, where every breath of air he breathes has the dust of steel filings, and other things as bad floating in it. What I hope for most is, that a plenty of fresh air will give him back his health. He has been growing paler and paler, the last three months."</p>
               <p>"John, too, is growing pale, and he does not walk so upright, and with so firm a step as he did when I was first acquainted with him."</p>
               <p>"The air of Spitalsfield is no better than that of Sheffield, where James is."</p>
               <p>"I sometimes think it is worse. Come Letty, why do you sit with your bonnet on? Take it off and stay with us to-night."</p>
               <p>"Well, I believe I will. It is too long a walk to my boarding-place, for so late an hour, and I want to see John, too, and talk with him about going to America."</p>
               <p>Letty took off her bonnet and went to the little looking-glass to see if her hair had not become disarranged.</p>
               <p>"James likes that I should wear my hair in this way," said she, arranging the curls that clustered round her white forehead, "and though I know that he wont see me again, till the day we've set, I shall wear it the way that best suits him."</p>
               <p>"So I would, Letty. There John is coming, that is his step, I know," and taking the candle she opened the door and held it so that it threw its light down the long, dark passage.</p>
               <p>It was pleasant surprise to Ellsley to see the bright, cheerful face of Letty, as he entered the room, yet before asking her about James, or anything relative to her late excursion, he took a look behind the white curtain, where Charley lay asleep, with a smile hovering on his red lips.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps he is dreaming of Nora and little Eva," said he.</p>
               <p>"Has any one inquired for him yet?" Mary asked.</p>
               <p>"No, though I have heard enough to be satisfied that the girl he called Nora sailed in the packet yesterday; but whether she left him behind by accident or design, it is not easy to tell."</p>
               <p>Ellsley thought he was tired, when he first came home, but when Letty spoke to him about going to the United States, all sense of weariness and fatigue was gone. All aglow with a dewy freshness and a golden light, such as used to bathe the green hills and the flowery vales where he spent those delicious years of his boyhood, which still cheered him with their remembered brightness, he beheld in imagination a new home in the far-off land. Mary smiled as she saw the light break over his countenance, and said in a low voice, as if speaking to herself:</p>
               <p>"Golden fancies may be better to the poor and lowly than golden palaces to the rich and noble."</p>
               <p>It was an hour later than usual, when John and Mary bethought themselves of the evening hymn, which they always sung before they retired to rest. Letty's clear voice now blended with theirs. The noises of the city were gradually dying to a faint murmur, as the low, sweet music of the hymn arose, and stealing through the open window, floated away upon the murky night air, sometimes entering the dreary and noisome chambers of the weary and toil-worn, and causing them to dream of spirit voices.</p>
               <p>Something more than a year had passed, since John and Mary Ellsley and their sister Letty Spent the evening together, talking of a home in the West. The evening shadows were lengthening and lay in cool, dark masses on the green turf which surrounded a rude but comfortable dwelling. In a neat apartment there was a table laid for four, though no one was present, except James and Letty Harford.</p>
               <p>"Do you think they will come, James?" said Letty, as her husband, with the glow of health breaking through the swart hue, which labor in the open air had planted on his cheeks, came in from the garden.</p>
               <p>"Yes, there can be no doubt of it. It is hardly time to expect them yet, as they will be obliged to perform the last twenty miles of their journey in a wagon."</p>
               <p>James took up a newspaper, a luxury which had never been within his reach, till he lived in his new home, and seated himself at a window, which commanded a prospect of the high-road. Letty sat near him with her sewing, but she made little progress. She soon threw it aside and went out to gather violets and other wild-flowers, which having arranged in a little china vase, she placed on the mantel.</p>
               <p>"John will like these," she said; I remember that he once made some poetry about wild-flowers."</p>
               <p>James, instead of answering her, threw his paper aside and quickly rose from his chair.</p>
               <p>"John and Mary are coming," said he. "I can distinctly hear the rumbling of wheels."</p>
               <p>He and Letty went to the door, and in a few minutes a wagon drawn by two horses appeared in sight. Letty could not wait for it to arrive, but ran to meet it. James forgot that in his quality of host, he had intended to appear somewhat dignified, and followed her example. The greetings on both sides were very joyful and had a great deal of heart in them; yet as these are qualities which display themselves in manner, rather than in words, it is not easy to exhibit them on paper. It would be like attempting to braid sunbeams with gathered flowers.</p>
               <p>There was no brighter or happier face than little Charley's. He remembered cousin Letty, and he remembered stories she used to tell him, particularly the story of the "cow with the crumpled horn."</p>
               <p>"Have you ever heard anything from Charley's friends yet, Mary?" said Letty.</p>
               <p>"Not a word," was the reply, "and I almost hope that we never shall, it would be so very hard to part with him."</p>
               <p>All their prospective plans were talked over that evening. It is difficult to imaging how they contrived to say so much in a few hours, but everything was settled before the brothers and sisters parted for the night. They were, for the present, to make only one family, and, in the meantime, materials for another dwelling-house were to be gathered together with as much expedition as was convenient, to be built on land adjoining James Hardord's farm, which he had purchased for Ellsley.</p>
               <p>"Who does that pretty cottage belong to, about a quarter of a mile from here?" said Mary, as she and Letty were busy with the house-hold duties.</p>
               <p>"To a gentleman by the name of Mansfield, I've been fold," was Letty's reply.</p>
               <p>"I took particular notice of the cottage and the grounds as we passed, for they reminded me of some I have seen in England."</p>
               <p>"Captain Mansfield resided in England till within a year or two, I've understood."</p>
               <p>"Have you seen him, or any of the family yet?"</p>
               <p>"No, it is only a week since they came to the cottage. A man who has been to work for Mr. Mansfield, says he has lost his wife, and has only one child, a little girl, a year and a half old."</p>
               <p>Mary and Letty often took long and pleasant rambles, to gather berries and flowers, and enjoy the fresh air. Little Charley always went with them, and every day he grew lovelier, and looked more healthy and vigorous.</p>
               <p>One day they entered a green lane, which separated the grounds of Captain Mansfield from a field belonging to James Harford. They had not proceeded far when they saw a young girl approaching, drawing a tasteful little wagon, in which was seated a child with a sweet, joyous face peering out from beneath a straw hat, wreathed with wild roses, and other flowers, which grew in profusion by the way-side. Charley who had bounded on before them, chasing a large butterfly, with wings of purple and gold, was so intent on his sport that he was almost at the girl's side before he noticed her. All at once they saw her drop the thill of the little wagon, and, with an exclamation expressive of the most joyful surprise, spring towards him and take him in her arms Charley, with his plump, dimpled arms wound round her neck, and his face brimful of joy, called to Mary:</p>
               <p>"Here's Nora—I've found Nora," said he.</p>
               <p>Mary turned pale, but quickly recovered herself.</p>
               <p>"I ought to feel glad—I know I ought to," said she to her sister, "for he will be so much better off with his rich friends, and I've no doubt I shall, when I have time for reflection; yet, just now, the thought of giving him up is very painful."</p>
               <p>Nora was too much transported with joy, at so unexpectedly finding the child she doubted not was dead, to think of the singularity of the circumstance of meeting him in a place so remote from where she lost sight of him. Charley had not forgotten his little sister Eva, and Nora had just placed him by the side of the wagon, when Mary and Letty reached the spot. Her round, rosy face, surrounded by curls, bright and sunny as his own, was an object of great delight to him, while she gave evident tokens of pleasure at having him near her.</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5844-00000043"/>
               <p>"Are you going to leave me, Charley?" said Mary, "and go and live with Nora?"</p>
               <p>For a minute he looked sober and thoughtful. It seemed, at first, to be a knotty question, but he soon settled it in his own mind.</p>
               <p>"No," he replied, "I will live with you, and Nora and Eva will live with you, too."</p>
               <p>"Your papa will never consent to that," said Nora.</p>
               <p>"Is Captain Mansfield his father?" inquired Letty.</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am," replied Nora, "and 'twill be a joyful day to him, when he knows little Charley is found. He's gone over to the village, but if he knew it, he would soon be back."</p>
               <p>"How came it about that he was lost?"</p>
               <p>"It was all owing to the carelessness of the man, who promised me that he would carry him aboard the packet, it being as much as I could do myself to carry little Eva. The cars had been detained, so that it was late when they arrived at the station, and all was hurry and confusion when we reached the wharf where the packet was waiting. I had but just stepped aboard, expecting Charley was close behind me, when I found the vessel had begun to move. I looked round, but Charley was not near me, as I had supposed, and then I began to feel frightened, and hunted everywhere, and inquired of everybody I saw, but neither he nor the man who offered to bring him aboard the vessel was anywhere to be found. Some said that it was most likely the child had fallen into the water and was drowned, and others that there might not be time for the man to bring him aboard before the packet put off. 'Twas a miserable life I led, the whole voyage, thinking of what might have happened to the poor child; and if it had not been there was no one to take care of little Eva, I believe I should have been tempted to jump overboard and drown myself."</p>
               <p>"How came the children to be entrusted entirely to your care?" asked Letty.</p>
               <p>"Why you see ma'am that their father, Captain Mansfield, had come to this country, and had found a place that suited him. So he wrote to his wife that he was coming for her and the children in a few weeks, but she, poor lady, when the letter arrived, was very ill, and she lived only a few days. As soon as the captain heard she was dead, he sent another letter, saying there was a good chance for him to make a voyage to some place—I forget where—and that as he should think less of his loss to have employment, he had concluded to go. He was sorry on his children's account, as it would prevent his coming for them, but he said he should feel easier to have them with his sister who lived in New York, while he was absent, than to have them remain in England, so he made the necessary arrangements, and requested me to come with them to this country."</p>
               <p>"And what did he say when he found his boy was lost?" said Letty.</p>
               <p>"He took on very bad, at first, and blamed me, but after he grew more composed he said, seeing I was so young and inexperienced, he did wrong to put so much care upon me. He went to England, as soon as he could, to make inquiries for the child, but he could hear nothing that could be depended on, so he came back quite down-hearted and disconsolate. He had given up all expectation of seeing the happy day, that now, as it were, will take him unawares."</p>
               <p>It was not many days after this that John and Mary Ellsley found a home at the cottage. Captain Mansfield said that he needed them both: the one to oversee the out-door work, the other as a housekeeper. It was moreover very pleasant to him to have those near him, who had been such tender and faithful friends to his lost child.</p>
               <p>Thus, though little Charley's plan was not literally carried into effect, it was quite as satisfactory to him, as it was to all else concerned.</p>
               <p>All thought of building a new house was, of course, abandoned by Ellsley. It would have taken him and Mary many a long year, and cost them much hard labor, to surround themselves with the comforts which they here found ready prepared. Better than all, they were no longer haunted by the fear of being obliged to part with Charley, who was the dearer to them, for having been a source of so much joy in the dark, gloomy apartment, where even a stray sunbeam could find no place to enter.</p>
               <p>Captain Mansfield, happy in the restoration of his son, for more than a year, was content to stay at home. Then at intervals, came longings for "the sea—the sea—the open sea."</p>
               <p>The intervals grew shorter, and he became restless, and with the return of another summer he was abroad on his favorite element.</p>
               <p>About four years after John and Mary Ellsley had lived in their new home a letter was received by the former, from one who had been his fellow laborer, when in England, and who, like himself, was better educated than most of his class. A few extracts will show its purport. It said, after one or two introductory sentences:</p>
               <p>"There have been only a few times in my life that I felt so sad and down hearted as the day I went home from my work, and found lying on my table a little book, which on opening I found contained poems by John Ellsley. As my eye rested on the words, the load seemed to be lifted from my heart,—I felt myself raised in my own esteem, for I held in my hand poems written by one, at whose side I had toiled many a long day, and often far into the night, which were thought worthy to be printed.</p>
               <p>"You say in your preface, that they are nothing more than a few poor flowers to strew in the path of those who had been your fellow-laborers, as well as all who have nothing to look forward to, better than days of privation and toil, such as have already been endured. Far from being poor, they are to me, and to many others, very precious. The more so, because we feel that they are ours—that we have a right to them. You may be sure, John, that they will spread their bloom over many a sharp flint stone that lies in the path of the poor operatives. They will sometimes do more than that. They will win them from coarse pleasures, which many had come to imagine were the only ones they were worthy to partake."</p>
               <p>Tears were in John Ellsley's eyes, but they were tears of joy, when he handed the letter to Mary, saying as he did so: "My heart's desire is accomplished."</p>
               <p>It was a gala day at the cottage, for Captain Mansfield had just returned from a prosperous voyage,—the last, he said, which he intended to make; and his son had completed his twenty-first year. Everybody within several miles had been invited to assist in celebrating an era, in the life of both father and son, and everybody, who possibly could, had accepted the invitation.</p>
               <p>In Charles Mansfield, the little Charley of other days would not have been recognized. He had grown to be a tall, handsome young man of engaging manners, and what was of much greater importance, his mental and moral qualities were of a high order. His sister Eva was the liveliest girl present, yet on one envied her. It would have been as unnatural as to have envied a rose on account of its beauty and fragrance. Captain Mansfield was, as he well might be, proud of both of his children, and none of the guests were more honored, or were happier, than John and Mary Ellsley, and James and Letty Harford.</p>

               <head>THE FORGET-ME-NOT.</head>
               <head type="sub">MISS ANNE T. WILBUR.</head>
               <p>"YES, ladies, the dahlia comes to us from Mexico, who, when she gave it to us in the last century, addressed it rather to our palates than to our eyes. In fact, the Mexicans esteem it as a vegetable, and not as a flower. They cook its roots like potatoes, usually in the ashes, and regale themselves with their aromatic bitterness. Cooking deprives them of an eighth of their volume, detaches their exterior envelope, and communicates to the pulp a saccharine taste. The descendants of Pizarro also eat the roots of the dahlia cut into slices and browned in butter, or dressed with white sauce. It is with them equivalent to salsify and asparagus. As a salad, it is the rival of chicory, called <foreign xml:lang="FRA">barbe de capucin.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Enough of the kitchen, Monsieur Morisseau, you are too material. Pass, if you please, from the root to the flower. We have not the least intention of supping on our dahlias."</p>
               <p>"And you are wrong, ladies; the experiment is worth the trial. Ask the turkeys and hens, the ass, the horse, the sheep, the ox and the cow, who adore the root in question, especially when it is cooked by steam. France has rejected the dahlia as an edible, because the first cooks who served it were so unskilful as not to deprive it of its vegetable juices. It was cooked too fresh, and found detestable. But for that we should have had acres of dahlias, as well as of turnips and carrots."</p>
               <p>"I prefer the beds in our gardens. Once more, Monsieur Morisseau, I entreat you to rise above the level of the kitchen, and give us the dahlia at full length, instead of painting its foot."</p>
               <p>"Charming! charming!—you have the wit of an angel! To return to Mexico, I must, nevertheless, tell you that the florists of that country, who sell the dahlias, are simply vegetable merchants. They throw you in or give you the flower, and receive pay only for the root. They are, nevertheless, as coquettish as the most elegant florists, with the Spanish veil thrown over their shoulders, the delicate cigaretti in their hands, the smile with their white teeth, their stealthy glance, and limbs crossed before their stands in such a manner as to show a darling little foot. I have been assured that the first botanist-painter who went to Mexico to study the dahlia, forgot to paint the flowers while taking the portrait of the flower merchants. However that may be, the dahlia was brought to Europe in the year 1790, and cultivated at first in the Jardin des Plantes, at Madrid. Cavanilles, the celebrated Spanish naturalist, described and made popular this conquest of our parterres. He classed it among the corymbiferes, and imposed upon it the name of the botanist, Andre Dahl, known in science by his studies on Linnæus. The dahlia was introduced into France by Doctor Thibaud, in 1802. The new flower had but to appear in order to succeed. Propagated by the naturalist, Andre Thouin, it was at first cultivated in a hot-house, then in a more temperate atmosphere, then in the orangery, finally in the open air—not only in the south of France, but beyond the botanical zone of the vine. At present it is the queen of our gardens between summer and autumn, with the poor as well as with the rich, in the country as in the city. This beautiful plant belongs to the family of radices of Tournefort, syngenesia of Linnæus, and dicotyledonees-corymbiferes of Jussieu. It is herbaceous, perennial by its roots, annual by its stalks. Its height, which approaches to that of shrubs, varies from one to four metres."</p>
               <p>"Enough! enough! Monsieur Morisseau; you are becoming scientific and wearisome."</p>
               <p>"I will finish, ladies, by naming a virtue of the dahlia, which you have perhaps not remarked—the vegetative power of its tubercles. I have seen some which, left on the shelves of an orangery, had grown a foot long, with flowers of a beautiful violet; others, in an overturned pot, without any contact with the earth, vegetating during two consecutive years, and crowning themselves, before dying, with blooming tufts of the richest reddish-brown, like that which I have just nibbed for the pencil of mademoiselle."</p>
               <p>This monography of the dahlia was narrated by Gabriel Morisseau, already named, to M'lles Louise Desnos and Angele Savary, in a little parlor looking out upon the public road, at the extremity of the town of L——, in Flanders.</p>
               <p>M'lle Louise Desnos, who was often called "madame" by politeness, was a lady, still beautiful under her crown of forty springs, mingled with imperceptible gray hairs, those dry leaves of humanity. Even these were the children of sorrow rather than of age.</p>
               <p>Retired ten years before to L——, in a small house which substantial citizens would call a hut, but whose site, garden and tapestry of vines, were admired by artists, M'lle Louise enjoyed a very small revenue, and very great consideration; distinguished for her politeness and her cap, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">a la Recamier,</foreign> cultivated the virtues and the knitting of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ancient regime,</foreign> piquet in her saloons, and dahlias in her garden.</p>
               <p>Ah! these dahlias were the last passion of the charming woman. She preferred them first because they blossomed until November—the faithful friends of autumn and of melancholy. Then she adored them because her niece, M'lle Angele Savary, painted them admirably. You will see that she had a third motive, anterior and more touching still; but the latter was a profound secret.</p>
               <p>The niece of M'lle Desnos, another idol of her soul, and the most beautiful flower of her life, Angele Savary, the only remnant of an extinct family, was at eighteen the pearl of L——, less by her beauty than by her charms and her talents. With pale complexion, tender eyes, exquisite smile, and hair in wavy bands, she escaped vulgar eyes and delighted people of taste and mind like the wood-violet or the eglantine of the hedges. Four cares divided her time—to pray to God and succor the poor; to be attentive to her aunt, her adopted mother, and the neighbors who came to play piquet with her; to cultivate dahlias at morning and evening, and paint them the rest of the day.</p>
               <p>Loving her flowers too much to give many away, but too generous absolutely to refuse them, M'lle Louise reconciled her kindness as a woman, and her little selfishness as a collector, by distributing to her neighbors and friends her finest dahlias, painted by her niece. The villas and even the cottages of the neighbors were hung with them, for it was sufficient to say to Angele, at the windows where she was at work:</p>
               <p>"M'lle Savary, I rely upon an El Dorado, a Gracilis, or a Rival Topaz, etc."</p>
               <p>These were the choice dahlias which her aunt gave away only as paintings.</p>
               <p>There was one, one only, of which she did not even grant the picture—not only because it was the prettiest and most rare, but because it recalled to her a mystery of her youth, all the poetry of her obscure life, a postscript which we shall read by-and-by.</p>
               <p>Without inquiring the reason, with the instinct of a woman's heart, Angele shared in the worship of her aunt for the <emph>Forget me not</emph>—the name of this famous dahlia. And this flower of a yellowish white, striped with red velvet, of an admirable form, peopled the house as it were, so had it been multiplied by the pencil of the young girl.</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5844-00000045"/>
               <p>On the day when this story commences, she was again painting the Forget-me-not, placed before her in rich clusters in a vase of porcelain, while M'lle Louise was knitting on her left, and M. Morisseau was rubbing her colors at her right.</p>
               <p>Gabriel Morisseau, a gentleman of thirty-six, was the friend of the Desnos family; a friend of not much consequence, witness his unprepossessing person, his proverbial simplicity, his platonic discretion, and his game-keeper's costume. Possessed of the mania of rendering services, he had introduced himself into the house of these ladies by bringing them a method of destroying the worms which gnawed their dahlias. This method having had the greatest success, Gabriel had taken his place at the piquet table of the aunt and the palette of the niece.</p>
               <p>They were talking together of the Mexican flower, whose tubercles Morisseau collected, and amused himself by cultivating in his study. It was now two years since he had ground colors for Angele, and recited to her the natural history of the dahlia, saying to himself apart, without ever opening his mouth on the subject:</p>
               <p>"M'lle Savary will end by distinguishing me, and her pretty hand will be the reward of my services?"</p>
               <p>When a young rival placed himself opposite him, and seemed about to succeed at his expense, he thought:</p>
               <p>"These coxcombs pass like butterflies. I have over them the advantage of patience, and my turn will come!"</p>
               <p>Meanwhile his hair was falling off; but his discretion maintained its post.</p>
               <p>Now on this day, as he finished the explanation we have just made, before the casement, beneath a warm autumnal sun, a diligence stopped at the relay house, opposite the Desnos cottage. On the imperial of this diligence, there was a young man, whom this position placed for an instant in full view of Angele and her work. At sight of both, he uttered an exclamation of surprise, and remained for a moment as if in ecstacy, with his eyes on the young girl and the flower she was painting. Then suddenly springing to the ground, he hastily interrogated the postillion, who was harnessing the horses.</p>
               <p>"Coach ready!" quickly exclaimed the driver.</p>
               <p>But instead of obeying him, the young man replied:</p>
               <p>"I remain here. Give me my trunk."</p>
               <p>"Now!" exclaimed the astonished conductor; "we have still a hundred leagues to travel, and you have paid to Paris."</p>
               <p>"I renounce my journey, and give you the fare. My trunk, quick!—there it is on the corner."</p>
               <p>"This is a great joke," said the conductor, to himself, as he handed down his baggage, and set off again on full trot.</p>
               <p>A quarter of an hour afterwards, the traveller had taken a room at the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Hotel des Postes,</foreign> emerged from it in an elegant costume, presented himself without any other ceremony at the door of M'lle Desnos, and appeared with three bows before the palette of the niece, the knitting of the aunt, and the eloquence of Morisseau. The stranger was a fine young man of twenty-six, with an intelligent and melancholy face, delicate moustache, and hair curling naturally, and manners distinguished without affectation.</p>
               <p>Of what was Angele dreaming at the moment he entered? She, herself, could not perhaps have told. But the appearance of this young man troubled her like the fulfilment of a vision.</p>
               <p>"Ladies," said he, with exquisite politeness, "pardon me this singular visit, and do not judge me without a hearing. I am the nephew of M. Hervey, the principal horticulturist of Marseilles. Since you love flowers, this name should be familiar to you. Deign to accept it as my excuse."</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly, sir," replied M'lle Desnos, handing him a chair. "The fame of M. Hervey is dear to all amateurs."</p>
               <p>"We appreciate it for a double reason, for my aunt is a Provencal," added M'lle Angele Savary, timidly.</p>
               <p>"I am delighted rather than surprised at it," replied the traveller, struck with the accomplished grace of the young girl; "Provence is the mother of choice flowers."</p>
               <p>The aunt and the niece blushed—the latter at the flattering speech, the former at the remembrance of Marseilles.</p>
               <p>Morisseau let fall the palette, and scratched the end of his nose, casting a shadowy glance on the perfections of the new comer.</p>
               <p>"This," continued Leon Hervey, "is the motive of my indiscretion. Two months since, a nabob of Nidzam passing through Marseilles—Prince Hyder Assour—requested of my uncle, among other plants, a collection of dahlias, a list of which he gave me, and which he wished to take with him to adorn his Indian palace. My uncle found and collected at great expense the flowers designated, with the exception of one which he could not discover. It was the dahlia, formerly common enough, but to-day forgotten, notwithstanding its name, 'Forgot-me-not.' My uncle proposed to the prince to substitute for it another—twenty others,—but the prince, an amateur, became but the more desirous of possessing it, because it was rare. And my uncle, commissioned to find it at any price, sent me to other countries in search of it. During a month, I have traversed all France, Great Britain, Holland and Belgium without meeting this flower, which a few years since everybody had, and which a fatal chance seems to have suppressed in Europe for the ruin of my uncle. I was returning in despair from Anvers, thinking only of regaining Marseilles, when this morning, a few moments since, passing by your house, and casting a glance at the window, I perceived and recognized in this vase and under the pencil of mademoiselle, the dahlia so vainly sought, the phœnix not to be found—in a word, the Forget-me-not. Imagine, ladies, my surprise and my joy. Judge whether I could neglect such a favor of Providence; and comprehend why I descended from the carriage, why I stopped at L——, why I almost forced your door, and why I ask of you instantly, at the price you shall yourselves fix, a root, a slip, or a seed of the Forget-me-not."</p>
               <p>This confidence produced three very different effects on the three persons who listened to it. M'lle Louise, oppressed by the memories awakened at each word, cast a tearful look on the face of the stranger and at the corollas of her beloved dahlia, and the more rare and precious it became, the more reluctant was she to part with it.</p>
               <p>M'lle Angele cast down her eyes and blushed with astonishment, and perhaps with a little vexation, on perceiving that the stranger, whose entrance had affected her so much, had been detained at L——, and attracted to her aunt's house, only for the acquisition of a root or a slip.</p>
               <p>As for Morisseau, the same discovery wrought in him a complete revolution. The suspected rival having become a simple amateur, he pressed his hand as an old acquaintance, uttered a tirade on the roots of the Forget-me-not, and plead his cause with M'lle Desnos.</p>
               <p>But the eloquence of the advocate, as well as the propositions of the client, failed. In vain the latter offered high prices, in vain he promised higher still—this attaching of pecuniary value to a flower which seemed to share her soul, did but wound M'lle Louise to such a degree as to draw tears from her eyes.</p>
               <p>This Leon perceived with as much regret as surprise, and was about to withdraw, without the expectation of returning, when Morisseau, persevering in his attempt to render a service, held out his hand, saying:</p>
               <p>"Come, come, we will talk of this business again. Mademoiselle has not given her final decision. The audience is postponed until tomorrow."</p>
               <p>"To a week hence, if it pleases these ladies," added Leon, gallantly. "I am in no hurry to gain my cause, and I will remain with pleasure—to plead it."</p>
               <p>These words, addressed to Angele, were heard by her only, and renewed the sensation she had felt at sight of him. The stranger saw a tacit encouragement, and Morisseau drew him away, repeating "Tomorrow."</p>
               <p>On the evening of this day, thanks to the obliging mania of Gabriel, Leon learned the particulars of the history of M'lles Desnos and Savary—except the secret, unknown to all, of the aunt's attachment to the Forget-me-not; and our traveller discovered, on interrogating the state of his heart, that it was no longer for the sake of the dahlia that he wished to remain at L——.</p>
               <p>At the interview of the morrow, Leon, accompanied by Morisseau, restrained with some difficulty the pleadings of the latter, and, instead of returning to the subject of the dahlia, related his own impressions of travel. He was charming in wit, animation and interest, especially in the portrait of the nabob, Hyder Assour.</p>
               <p>Twenty times a millionaire, and a hundred times an original, he had carried into his love for flowers the strategy of a diplomatist and the violence of a conqueror. He had begun by ravaging three provinces to obtain some curious plants; then he had freighted four ships, and embarked a hundred men to ransack the gardens of Europe.</p>
               <p>"When he traversed the greenhouses of my uncle, at Marseilles," said Leon, "followed by one of his forty gigantic lacqueys, whose French livery was strongly contrasted with the turban and the full robe of the master, sparkling with gold and silver, pearls and rubies, he devoured the colors with his eyes, and the perfumes with his nose, to such a degree that it seemed as if he<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5844-00000046"/> wished to absorb them into himself, in order to carry them to Hindostan. In this orgie of the senses, he fell into an ecstacy, like a Chinese drunk with opium, or a Turk gorged with baschich. At sight of the two hundred choice dahlias collected by M. Hervey, he caused an arm-chair, a table and a pipe to be brought, and passed eight hours as if enchanted before this spectacle, dreaming and singing, smoking and drinking, until night concealed the plants from his view. Judge after this," continued the narrator, "with what passion this man seeks the only dahlia wanting to his collection."</p>
               <p>Such was the only allusion of the young man to the Forget-me-not. Angele rewarded his discretion by bringing the vase of dahlias, and resuming her pencil and palette. Two or three other visits passed in conversation on Provence, and particularly on Aix, the favorite city of M'lle Desnos, whose prudence the traveller quieted by recalling a thousand souvenirs of youth, which made a tear start beneath her veiled eyelids. Leon recognized in this the road to the heart of the aunt, and made such rapid progress in it that at the end of the week he dared say to M'lle Savary:</p>
               <p>"I also can paint, mademoiselle; my humble talent is for crayon drawing. Allow me to copy with you the Forget-me-not, to send it to my uncle, while waiting for the original."</p>
               <p>The obliging Morisseau applauded this good idea; M'lle Desnos, thinking of Aix, saw no objection to it, and Leon thus assured himself new days of assiduity. He only asked that his work might not be seen until it was finished, declaring that all comparison with that of Angele would deprive him of the power to rival her. Three days passed in this manner, the two young people painting opposite each other, the vase of dahlias placed in between them; M'lle Louise listening to stories of Provence, and Morisseau grinding rose color for the two artists.</p>
               <p>He was grinding black for himself, if he could have read hearts. But he saw in this only a method of bringing about the sale of the famous bulb, and thus increasing the dowry of his future wife. Besides, he was rendering a service, and his good fortune blinded him to everything else. He was preparing for himself another great joy. In addition to the mania of obliging, he had that of playing pranks, and meant to play Leon the trick of looking at his drawing over his shoulder.</p>
               <p>After two days employed in meditating on this <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup d'etat,</foreign> as the third sitting was drawing to a close, Gabriel began to walk about the saloon. Then, seeing Leon more absorbed in his labors than ever, he stole behind him, and stood with open mouth on perceiving the portrait of a woman instead of that of a flower. Leon turned indignantly, and hastily concealed his work. Then he reddened with anger, turned pale with fear, and was about to have crushed the indiscreet observer with a gesture, when the latter reassured him by a burst of laughter.</p>
               <p>The young man, after having hastily sketched the dahlia, had been for two days engaged upon a portrait of Angele; but Morisseau, in his blindness, in his stupidity, in his precipitation, had mistaken the picture of the niece for that of the aunt.</p>
               <p>"Ah, the amiable theft!" exclaimed he, dropping into a chair. "Ah, M'lle Desnos, you will be disarmed by this trait, or you are stone and bronze! Come and see your portrait, drawn by this gentleman, and say if anything could be more like."</p>
               <p>And he was about to bring the original triumphantly before the copy, when Leon, recovered at last, and stopping him by an imperious sign, said:</p>
               <p>"One moment, Monsieur Morisseau, and a thousand pardons, mademoiselle. Since I am betrayed, please to sit, and in an hour I will show you a work less unworthy."</p>
               <p>Then, henceforth keeping the indiscreet man at a distance, he traced with rapidity the portrait of M'lle Louise, on the same leaf, covered by the portrait of Angele; he finished by one of those slight-of-hand tricks which the imminence of the danger inspired; and, while the aunt smiled complacently; while the niece was meditating on this mystery into which she saw farther than Morisseau; while the latter was laughing at his fine discovery, the artist, carefully guarding the picture of Angele, showed to each the image, striking in effect, but roughly sketched, of M'lle Desnos.</p>
               <p>"It is singular," said Gabriel, with staring eyes, "the work seemed to me just now to be complete."</p>
               <p>"I have profited by the sitting of the model to efface some details and improve the general effect. Such as it is now the work is slighter, but more artistic."</p>
               <p>And M'lle Louise, with gratitude a little confused, accepted the portrait as a souvenir and a farewell present from her countryman. This word <emph>farewell,</emph> pronounced intentionally by the aunt, who began to see that the stories about Provence had interested her too much,—this word, we say, struck two hearts at once, and Leon, catching like a drowning man at a straw, wished to carry something at least from Angele. While they were admiring his pretty sketch of the dahlia—very inferior to the accomplished work of the young girl—he said, with his eyes fixed on the latter:</p>
               <p>"My poor uncle will not consider himself repaid for the loss of the flower by my copy. May I not offer a better compensation, and <emph>send</emph> him (he accented the word which excluded the idea of departure), the painting of mademoiselle?"</p>
               <p>"You mean <emph>carry</emph> it to him," replied M'lle Louise, gravely. "On this condition I give Angele permission to dispose of it."</p>
               <p>The young girl turned pale, and her hesitation betrayed a terrible conflict. Taking at last her resolution, and holding out her work to Leon without looking at him, she said, in a faint voice:</p>
               <p>"I give it to you, sir, that you may indeed <emph>carry</emph> it to your uncle."</p>
               <p>"I accept it to keep forever!" returned Leon, in the young girl's ear; while the obliging Morisseau, who comprehended nothing of all these manœuvres, was still pleading with M'lle Desnos to sell the dahlia. But on seeing that he was losing his time, and the separation was inevitable, he added, with a protecting air:</p>
               <p>"In fact, M. Hervey cannot take root in L—— for the sake of a dahlia. Let him go, delegating his power to me; I will undertake the charge of his interests and inform him of my proceedings."</p>
               <p>Thereupon they separated, Morisseau accompanying Leon, M'lle Louise not daring to look at Angele, and Angele not daring to look into her own heart.</p>
               <p>Two days after, the traveller, instead of quitting L——, was more resolved than ever to remain there. He employed the hours which he did not pass in contemplating Angele herself, in looking at her portrait—for, having changed his room at the Hotel des Postes, he now saw from his window the young girl occupied in painting at her own.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, having announced his discovery to his uncle, he wrote each day giving a new pretext for remaining at L——, and his uncle replied that he must persist in his requests, that the nabob had given him <foreign xml:lang="FRA">carte blanche</foreign> for the sum, and that the decision must be made in ten days at farthest.</p>
               <p>One day M'lle Angele sent him a message to meet her in her aunt's garden. The little gate to the fields was to be left open. Judge whether the traveller was punctual. M'lle Louise had gone out, and her niece appeared alone with a servant.</p>
               <p>"Sir," said she, hastily, to Leon, interrupting his exclamations of joy, "you compel me to fail in a sacred duty, in order to fulfil one more sacred still. I have believed in your protestations of delicacy, and I come to demand the proof of them."</p>
               <p>"Speak, mademoiselle?" exclaimed the young man, earnestly. "You know that you can require anything of me; that my heart, my whole life—"</p>
               <p>"Do not repeat what you have already said too often, and what I can no longer listen to."</p>
               <p>"You will at least not reproach me for want of discretion?"</p>
               <p>"Even in taking my portrait instead of painting the Forget-me-not! Even in remaining in L——, when you cannot expect this flower! You see that I know all, sir."</p>
               <p>"Then you know that no power can hereafter separate me from you?"</p>
               <p>"On the contrary I am here to request you to depart, and to give you the means solicited by yourself. This dahlia, for which you offer so high a price, this treasure which my aunt will never sell, belongs to me as well as to her, and I will give you one. You can take it, and leave us immediately."</p>
               <p>As she spoke thus, with a superhuman effort, pale and resigned as a victim at the altar, Angele, without looking at the young man, showed him the Forget-me-not, cultivated by herself.</p>
               <p>But in vain she repeated her heroically generous offer; instead of taking the precious dahlia, Leon seized the trembling hand of the young girl, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Accept this flower and lose you! Ah, it would be to pay dearer for it than all the gold of Nidzam! I renounce it, mademoiselle, and will remain near you; but instead of an unknown, a passer-by, who is trying to make a bargain, it is as a suitor for your hand, which I will this evening demand of your aunt."</p>
               <p>Although Angele had perhaps foreseen this denouement, she was so much affected by it, that she left him without replying and almost overcome. Leon, who read this pure and tender<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5844-00000047"/> soul, asked no more, and went away repeating:</p>
               <p>"This evening!"</p>
               <p>Returned home, he found Morisseau, who cried out with a triumphal air:</p>
               <p>"You are just in time. I have fought and conquered in your behalf. I have arranged a walk with these ladies on the banks of the pond. You shall be there by accident. I will give my arm to the niece; you shall offer yours to the aunt, and can resume the grand affair of the dahlia."</p>
               <p>"Decidedly," thought Leon, as he accepted with enthusiasm, "this Morisseau was brought into the world to render services."</p>
               <p>On the days following, Leon did indeed return to the Desnos house, and great negotiations were renewed in an undertone, Gabriel alone being ignorant of their object. M. Hervey had but to explain his intentions to see his homage accepted by both aunt and niece. We need not inform the reader that Angele would have been much disappointed had Leon accepted her Forget-me-not, and obeyed her injunctions to depart. As to M'lle Desnos, she had said but one thing to the young girl:</p>
               <p>"Since you love him, and he is worthy of you, God forbid that I should inflict upon your life an eternal regret."</p>
               <p>Things were in this state one fine morning, and the party were assembled as usual in the saloon of M'lle Desnos, when the door opened hastily, and young Hervey saw enter, whom?—his uncle, in person, whom he had not heard from for five days!</p>
               <p>Not knowing what course to take, between the demands of the nabob and the delays of his nephew, the horticulturist had taken—posthorses. Alighted at the hotel opposite, in five minutes he had learned all. Laying aside the business of the house of Hervey for his own, Leon was in pursuit of a marriage instead of a dahlia.</p>
               <p>So the merchant flashed like lightning, and burst like a thunderbolt into the Desnos saloon. Fearful lightning and terrible thunder for everybody, not excepting the obliging Morisseau, who awaking at last from his lethargy, recognized a rival in his protege. He nearly fell over, picked up his hat which was rolling on the floor, and fled, bravely—to return after the storm.</p>
               <p>Imagine the explosions of the anger of M. Hervey, complicated of a sanguine temperament and two hundred pounds of flesh, condensed by six days' journey with four posthorses. Forgetting the aunt, forgetting the niece, forgetting where he was, he saw, apostrophized only Leon, and overwhelmed him for a quarter of an hour with a shower of reproaches, which terminated with this conclusion:</p>
               <p>"And my dahlia, wretch!—my dahlia!"</p>
               <p>By way of justification, the criminal humbled himself before his judge, and pointed to M'lle Angele Savary. M. Hervey deigned at last to turn his eyes, and stood as if he was bewildered. Strange circumstance!—not at sight of the niece, but at sight of the aunt.</p>
               <p>It seemed as if a distant remembrance, a forgotten vision, a phantom of youth suddenly passed before his eyes, and troubled his heart in the depths of a breast shielded by fifty winters. The impression was sudden, but the result remained. Controlled by the gentle face of M'lle Louise, as by a supernatural power, the infuriated merchant became calm, and wiped his forehead; he felt and excused the incivility of his proceedings, and terminated his discourse with the politeness which should have commenced it. Then returning to the question like a man of business, he said:</p>
               <p>"I thought I came here to conclude a bargain, and I see that there are two on the carpet."</p>
               <p>He cast a glance on Angele, and another on her paintings of the Forget-me-not; but M'lle Desnos stopped him, making a sign to her niece. The latter turned pale, rose and went into her room. M. Hervey resumed, with his rough frankness:</p>
               <p>"How much do you wish for your dahlia, mademoiselle? And what is the dowry of M'lle Savary?"</p>
               <p>"Sir," replied M'lle Desnos, with a firmness mingled with sadness, "I will not sell my dahlia at any price; and my niece has no fortune but her virtue!"</p>
               <p>The merchant made a grimace.</p>
               <p>"Virtue is a treasure," said he; "unfortunately it is not current at the Exchange."</p>
               <p>"What care I for a dowry?" exclaimed Leon; "I ask only the hand of mademoiselle, and will pledge myself with my devotedness, my youth, my activity."</p>
               <p>"To die of hunger with her," interrupted the uncle. "No childishness, but let us talk reason," continued he; "I think M'lle Savary charming, and I wish to contribute to the happiness of my nephew. I will give you thirty thousand francs for the Forget-me-not, mademoiselle, and these thirty thousand francs shall be the commencement of Leon's fortune. I began with less, and my business has prospered. Does this arrangement suit you?"</p>
               <p>"It is impossible, sir," replied M'lle Louise, after a painful hesitation and with an effort which seemed to exhaust her energy.</p>
               <p>"Then, why have you received my nephew here? Why have you suffered these young people to become attached to each other? That you might destroy at once his happiness, that of your niece, your own, and ruin me into the bargain?"</p>
               <p>"On the contrary, sir," said M'lle Desnos, mildly, "if I have not separated these young people after having ascertained the sincerity of their affection, it has been to spare their lives the sufferings and the regrets which you would appreciate in my place."</p>
               <p>"These are very fine words," replied the merchant, drawing out his watch. "The courier will set out on his return, in two hours; it will take me three days to regain Marseilles. I lose two hundred thousand francs if the prince Hyder Assour arrives there before me. Be ready, Leon. Accept, mademoiselle, my regrets and my adieux, unless you will take (it is my last offer!) thirty-five thousand francs for the Forget-me-not."</p>
               <p>As he spoke thus, M. Hervey took the hand of his nephew. The latter trembled like a criminal who sees his existence suspended to a thread. M'lle Desnos looked alternately, with inexpressible anguish, at the countenance of the young man, at the door of Angele's room, and at the pictures of the beloved dahlia.</p>
               <p>"Sir," said she at last, to the merchant, "I ask a quarter of an hour's grace. Follow me to my room, and you will learn why I am unwilling to part with this flower, or to separate M. Leon Hervey from my niece."</p>
               <p>The voice which pronounced these words, the look which accompanied them, revived in the heart of the horticulturist his recent presentiment. He followed M'lle Desnos to her room with the docility of a child.</p>
               <p>This room looked out upon the garden directly above a bed of the celebrated dahlias. Their aspect bewildered M. Hervey. He noticed them, also, on the furniture, in pots of porcelain; and stood in ecstacy at the sight of a flowery pyramid in the midst of the open window. M'lle Louise was herself so troubled that she did not notice his emotion, and they seated themselves in silence.</p>
               <p>"It is nearly forty years since," said she, "that a terrible storm raged at Marseilles, making all hearts tremble in the terrified city, and putting in peril all the vessels in the bay. Two females who were strangers to each other met in the chapel of Bon-Secours, at the feet of the statue of the virgin. They were two mothers, who were making a vow each for her child. The one expected her son, aged seven years, who was returning from America with her husband; the other was awaiting her daughter, aged two, who was also returning with her father from the same country. The two mothers related their anxieties to each other, and discovered that their husbands and children were on board the same ship, the Belzunce, tossed at this moment at the mouth of the Rhone."</p>
               <p>"The Belzunce!" repeated M. Hervey to himself, seeking to revive his reminiscences of the past.</p>
               <p>"The next morning, the sea threw on the shore the wreck of the vessel with the bodies of her crew. The two fathers were saved and in the arms of their wives; but they sought in vain for the children, whom shipwreck had wrested from their love. An hour had passed in fearful anxiety, when the waves brought to the shore a plank, on which were the little boy and girl, fainting but still breathing. Their common safety was the work of the first who had had the courage to fasten himself to this board with the gentle companion of his sports during the voyage."</p>
               <p>"And who was this little girl?" asked M. Hervey.</p>
               <p>"It was myself," replied M'lle Desnos.</p>
               <p>The merchant wiped his forehead and drew his chair nearer.</p>
               <p>"You will divine the union that sprang up between these two families, with the smiles of the children, delivered by such a miracle. We were conducted in triumph to the chapel of Bon-Secours; we were both devoted to the holy virgin, and solemnly betrothed. Should not two existences thus commenced indeed have continued and terminated together? We passed three years in calling each other little husband and wife. Then Albert entered college; I, also was sent to a boarding school; and during the three years which followed, we saw each other only in vacations. At the end of this time, our separation became complete. Albert was travelling with his father; he made the tour of Europe, but without ceasing to write, and to receive my<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5844-00000048"/> replies, and we were more strongly attached than ever. We had reached thus, I the age of twenty, he of twenty-five, and his last message, the tenderest and dearest of all, had announced to me his return in a month, to espouse me before the same altar which had united our infancy.</p>
               <p>"I was holding in my hand this blessed letter, and my tears of joy were still flowing, when my father, entering my room with a severe countenance, declared that this betrothal was a childish folly: that we must renounce it; that I should never see Albert again, and that he had more serious intentions on my behalf. A stranger, who was called a <emph>good match,</emph> had asked my hand in marriage. I refused to receive him, and spent a week in tears. My father gave out that I was ill and closed the door upon Albert. My mother was, like myself, in despair, but could give me no aid. Surprised and alarmed at not hearing from Albert, I one day fell into my mother's arms, and begged her to tell me what was the matter. By degrees she revealed that, more obedient than myself to the will of his father, Albert had allowed his views to be turned in another direction, that he was about to set out for America, where the hand and fortune of a Creole-lady awaited him. I was annihilated; but I did not believe my mother. I would not believe her, for I should have died—and I lived with my faith unshaken. Notwithstanding my seclusion, I succeeded in learning that Albert was indeed going. I then really fell sick; but I still did not believe in his infidelity. Meanwhile, my birthday arrived; by a fatal coincidence, it was the day before Albert's departure. My father doubtless trembled for me, for he overwhelmed me with attentions all day; my bed was surrounded with flowers and with presents; but the finest came from the <emph>rich suitor,</emph> Albert's rival, and I scarcely looked at them through a shower of tears. At the close of the day, I was left alone with my mother, and could at last freely relieve my heart. Has Albert then forgotten me? Will he depart without assuring me of his return? My mother's only reply was to embrace me affectionately; then she went to her room and returned with a large bouquet.</p>
               <p>"I see it still in its freshness," pursued M'lle Desnos, in a deep voice, while M. Hervey placed his handkerchief to his eyes, "it was a bunch of those beautiful dahlias, then in their novelty, which the English call Forget-me-not; yes, I see still their silvery petals, with a light shade of gold, and striped so delicately with purple velvet. In the obscurity which filled my room, in the night which enveloped my soul, they seemed to wear the brightness and smiles of a rainbow, with the most radiant pearls of the morning dew. This moment was the happiest of my life.</p>
               <p>"'Albert will not go at least without some token,' said my mother, presenting me the bouquet; 'these flowers came from him, and I am commissioned to give them to you with his last remembrance."</p>
               <p>"His last remembrance!" exclaimed I, passing from the sweetest hopes to the most poignant anguish.</p>
               <p>And my mother repeated that Albert was about to seek other destinies in America, that I must no longer think of him, but submit to the will of my father. I passed the night in a state of delirium, with my bouquet in my hand, and dreaming of the Belzunce, the chapel of Bon-Secours, and the ship which was to bear Albert away. Three times I thought I heard his voice and his steps beneath my window; then, convinced at last that it was an illusion, I found myself in the morning alone with my bouquet, having no longer any hope, but unable to believe in his forgetfulness. Albert had indeed departed, and two years passed away without my having heard from him, and without shaking my faith. I renounced the hope of seeing him, only learning his death in the colonies.</p>
               <p>"His death!" exclaimed M. Hervey starting from his chair.</p>
               <p>"Alas, yes! it was my poor mother who announced it to me, summoning me for the last time, to obey my father. But the death of my father himself soon came to terminate this conflict, and we left Provence for Flanders, where I have devoted my life to the happiness of my niece, Angele, and to the culture of the Forget-me-not. These dahlias were my most valuable property; when I left Marseilles, I bought up all I could find of the horticulturists, and would have deprived of them the entire world. It seemed to me that the soul of Albert had passed into this flower of his last adieu, and that each corolla expanding in my garden, in my room, or under the pencil of Angele, said to me in a language which I alone comprehended: No, Albert has not forgotten thee for another; yes, he died faithful to the memories of the Belzunce, and of the hundred letters which renewed the promises of his childhood.</p>
               <p>"And now that you know my history," concluded M'lle Desnos, turning towards M. Hervey, "now that my existence has been but a long mourning far from the only man whom I could love; now that this flower of the Forget-me-not, an emanation of my childhood and my youth, is the only consolation of my riper years and the only hope of my approaching old age; now that I have recognized in the heart of my niece for M. Leon, your nephew, the same unalterable sentiment which formerly attached me to Albert; now that you have procured me the only joy which I could expect here below, that of learning that the Forget-me-not only blossomed in my garden, in the rays of my smiles, and bedewed with my tears; now that I can only die if I must crush the soul of Angele and profane my beloved dahlias, I ask you, sir, and you shall be the judge, can I sell you these flowers, or separate my niece from your nephew?"</p>
               <p>"And I," replied M. Hervey, who rose at last trembling with an emotion restrained by a supernatural effort, "and I ask permission to complete your history by the history of <emph>Albert du Charni.</emph> Was not that his name?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!" exclaimed M'lle Louise; "how did you know it?"</p>
               <p>"Then why do you call yourself M'lle Desnos and not M'lle <emph>Le Vaillant?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Because I have taken the name of M. Desnos, the second husband of my mother, as indulgent for me as my father was rigorous."</p>
               <p>"Very rigorous, indeed," continued M. Hervey, with his eyes raised to heaven; "for he deceived you cruelly. The truth was that Albert decided on his last voyage only in despair at your silence, and after having addressed to you several letters, all probably intercepted. The evening before his departure, that of your birthday, he passed long hours in wandering around your house, pitilessly closed to him. In the evening, while you were sighing in bed, he was sighing beneath your window. By night, when you thought you heard his steps and his voice, it was no illusion of feverish slumbers but a reality. It was indeed himself awaiting the signal of life or death from you. Only in the morning did he depart, more unhappy than yourself, for he had lost faith in you forever. And yet, he has refused the hand and fortune of many women because they were not Louise Le Vaillant; through all his voyages, amid business interests and cares which whiten the head and harden the heart, his own has retained fresh, unsullied and pure as in a sanctuary, the name and memory of the young betrothed of Marseilles."</p>
               <p>M'lle Louise listened to these words with palpitating heart, and eyes swimming with tears, thinking herself in a dream and fearing to awake, observing M. Hervey, and not daring to believe in her presentiments.</p>
               <p>"Ah, sir," murmured she, at last, almost fainting, "where learned you all this?—are you sure of it?—you know Albert then?—can he be living?—then, where is he?—I should die if you had deceived me! Give me proofs of his existence."</p>
               <p>M. Hervey seized the hand of M'lle Denos.</p>
               <p>"What has become of the bouquet of Albert?" asked he, "have you preserved it?"</p>
               <p>M'lle Desnos opened a casket, from whence she took the bouquet of dahlias, withered twenty years since.</p>
               <p>"This is indeed it," said M. Hervey, turning it over with a trembling hand. "Here is indeed the green ribbon with which Albert tied these flowers, his last hope and not his last remembrance. Detach this ribbon mademoiselle, at last, since you have not done so for twenty years! You will find the confirmation of all I have just told you."</p>
               <p>M'lle Louise hastily untied the knot, and a folded billet fell with the remnants of the flowers. It had remained there since the day of the "separation."</p>
               <p>Here is what the betrothed of Albert read through her tears:</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText>
                     <body>
                        <div type="letter">
                           <p>"DEAR LOUISE,—If your heart is not closed against me, like your door, if I am deceived in being told that you renounce me, open or cause to be opened your window for a single instant. I shall be there awaiting the signal of life or death. It will suffice to prove to me that you love me still, and I will not depart, I will never depart.</p>
                           <closer>
                              <signed>ALBERT."</signed>

                        </div>

                  </floatingText>
               </q>
               <p>"Albert waited until morning," continued M. Hervey, "but you know, mademoiselle, that the window was not opened! Then he thought himself banished by yourself, and embarked in despair. But—how wonderful are the ways of Providence!—the happiness denied to Albert's youth was reserved for his riper age. After twenty years of separation without forgetfulness, when an eternal abyss seemed to open between him and yourself; the distance of three hundred leagues, his name changed like your own, his face faded like the dahlias—an unexpected<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5844-00000049"/> chance, a prosaic affair, the affection of two young people, was destined to awaken at once this poem of the heart which had slumbered a quarter of a century; with this billet and these withered flowers! Albert has found you, mademoiselle; you, still charming and always faithful; he, already old, but faithful also, free as at the altar of Bon-Secours, and ready to keep the engagements of his childhood."</p>
               <p>M. Hervey knelt at the feet of M'lle Desnos, who exclaimed, as she extended her arms towards him:</p>
               <p>"What! you, Albert du Charni?"</p>
               <p>"To-day Albert Hervey, as inheritor and director of a horticultural house."</p>
               <p>We will not describe the scene which followed such a recognition. The poesies of the heart are like unchangeable purposes; they exhale with so much the more charm, that they have been long imprisoned.</p>
               <p>"Well," said M'lle Desnos at the expiration of the interview, "I repeat my question, Monsieur Hervey: Can I sell the Forget-me-not, and can we separate Angele and Leon?"</p>
               <p>"The Forget-me-not is now ours," replied the merchant; "as for Angele and Leon, we will talk of them to morrow."</p>
               <p>"O, talk of us now!" exclaimed two voices at once. And Leon on one side, and Angele on the other, opening the door of the room, came as supplicants to learn their fate.</p>
               <p>The bouquet and the letter of Albert were still lying on the table. M. Hervey cast upon them a softened glance, then looked at M'lle Louise; and the betrothed of former years, extending their hands, pressed and united those of the lovers of the present.</p>
               <p>M. Hervey was about to bid adieu to M'lle Desnos to return to Marseilles, when the hero who had disappeared from the battle-field, Gabriel Morisseau, showed his face at the door of the saloon, and informed M. Hervey that a stranger, just arrived at the Hotel des Postes, had inquired for him impatiently, and that having been told he was at the house of M'lle Desnos, purchasing, a dahlia, he had insisted on following him thither.</p>
               <p>It was the nabob, Prince Hyder Assour.</p>
               <p>Imagine a Colossus with yellow complexion, sparkling eyes, curling beard, moustaches in the shape of a crescent, covered with silk, cashmere and pearls. He made three majestic bows, and said to the merchant:</p>
               <p>"M. Hervey I acknowledge that I had nearly made you a bankrupt, for despairing of obtaining the flower I desired, I had thrown up my bargain for the rest, when I remembered the name of the city whither you had gone in search of it, and started in pursuit. I see the Forget-me-not, and hope to purchase it."</p>
               <p>As he spoke this, the nabob drew out his purse and laid his hand on the dahlia, but M. Hervey, detaining him with a respectful gesture, said:</p>
               <p>"This flower does not belong to me, my lord; it is the property of this lady, who will not sell it, though on it depends my fortune and her own, the dowry of her niece and my nephew."</p>
               <p>"Is there no condition, then, mademoiselle," resumed the prince, on which I can obtain one of these dahlias?"</p>
               <p>"One only," repeated she at last, looking lovingly at her niece; "you must promise me that this flower shall never be given or sold to any person in Europe."</p>
               <p>"I subscribe to this condition," said the nabob, "and as the plant, of which I become the sole master, acquires thus a double value in my eyes, my duty is to double the dowry of your niece. Now, M. Hervey I leave you a month to celebrate this marriage, and will then meet you at Marseilles to settle our accounts."</p>
               <p>"Ah, my lord!" exclaimed the merchant, "you must add to your favors by being present at the wedding, only I warn you, that there will be two couples instead of one."</p>
               <p>"Another reason why I should accept the invitation," replied the prince with incomparable gallantry.</p>
               <p>And everybody broke out in expressions of joy and gratitude.</p>
               <p>Everybody, alas, excepting Gabriel Morisseau, so poorly compensated for his last service, and convinced, at length, that his turn would never come.</p>
               <closer>THE END.</closer>
