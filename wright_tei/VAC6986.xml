WrIDnaseeording to Act of Congress, in the year 1858.&#xD;

in the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the Southern District of New York.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
"Mother, I am almost a warrior now ! I&#xD;
am more fleet of foot than any runner in the&#xD;
tribe ! My arrow never misses its mark, and&#xD;
when Ohanwanho lets me shoot his rifle, my&#xD;
aim is yet more sure than his ! I am strong ;&#xD;
I will soon put my foot upon the war-path,&#xD;
nd then I will prove I am brave ! Now,&#xD;
hide from me no longer the place of my birth,&#xD;
or the name of my father ! It is time that I&#xD;
should know it !-time that I should know&#xD;
why we loiter here, away from the tribe of&#xD;
winch you say [ should be chief! There is&#xD;
hot, strong blood in my veins-a big heart&#xD;
-ats in my breast--I am an eagle, and must&#xD;
not be chained, or I will .die, beating myself&#xD;
to death with my own wings !"&#xD;
These words were uttered by an Indian&#xD;
youth, whose age might he fifteenor sixteen-&#xD;
it were hard to determine it, at a glance, for&#xD;
his form wasyet slender, though every muscle&#xD;
was well developed, and it in its grace, height-&#xD;
ened by his scanty but picturesque costume,&#xD;
would have formed a study for the first sculp-&#xD;
tor in the world. His features were noble,&#xD;
his eye large and flashing, and his thin nos-&#xD;
trils dilated, and his veins seemed to swell and&#xD;
darken as he spoke.&#xD;
She whom he addressed looked young to&#xD;
be the mother of such a boy-yet the like-&#xD;
ness of the two could not be mistaken. Tall,&#xD;
elegantly formed, clad, indeed, like an Indian&#xD;
queen, she was very, very beautiful. And a&#xD;
gook of settled sorrow added to her dignity,&#xD;
for there was pride rather than despondency&#xD;
mn it !&#xD;
They stood upon the banks of La Belle&#xD;
Rliviere, the then silvery Ohio, for the dust&#xD;
and stain of commerce had not then been cast&#xD;
spon its limpid bosom, nor the rush of paddle-&#xD;
wheels migled earth with water.&#xD;
t    "Tn1AvrNoAmaaA !"&#xD;
The mother laid her small hand upon the&#xD;
impatient youth's shoulder, as she uttered&#xD;
&#xD;
this word, and for a moment she looked him&#xD;
full in the face, firmly but not unkindly. He&#xD;
east his eyes down for a moment, and then&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Mother, my ears are open to your words--&#xD;
your eyes go through me, as the sun pierces&#xD;
the water!"&#xD;
"The first duty of a warrior is to learn pa.&#xD;
tienee and fortitude 1" she said, slowly.&#xD;
"Yes, mother! To bear hunger, thirst,&#xD;
pain of body, all without a murmur or a&#xD;
groan! These I am equal to,'but not, not to&#xD;
this agony of mystery. To know that I am&#xD;
something, and yet know not what-to feel&#xD;
that I have a field of action open for me-for&#xD;
me alone-yet know not where it is-to know&#xD;
that you have some hidden sorrow in your&#xD;
heart, and not know where to seek him who&#xD;
placed it there ! Again I ask-where is my&#xD;
father?"&#xD;
"Buried on the banks of the dear, dear Mo-&#xD;
hawk, where-where--"&#xD;
The woman suddenly restrained herself, but&#xD;
evidently with an effort.&#xD;
" Where you must guide meI" continued&#xD;
the'youth. "I will stand beside my father's&#xD;
grave, and there learn my name-there take&#xD;
counsel of his spirit, and learn what a war-&#xD;
rior's son should do. Mother, we must go to&#xD;
the Mohawk !"&#xD;
" Thayendaneges, I dare net!"&#xD;
"Mother, you are a squaw !"&#xD;
No pen could describe, or pencil properly&#xD;
delineate, the tone and attitude with which&#xD;
those words were delivered. To call a war-&#xD;
nor a squaw is the deadliest insult which can&#xD;
be given; to remind a woman that she is a&#xD;
squaw, is to bitterly reproach her for unwa.&#xD;
manly weakness.&#xD;
his scornful tone-low, but deep and tun-&#xD;
ing ; his turning upon his heel, with armed&#xD;
folded upon his breast, as if he deemed it be.-&#xD;
neath him to look upon her-all struck, like&#xD;
a thousand serpent bites, into her very heart&#xD;

THAYENDANEGEA, THE SCOURGE ; OR.&#xD;
&#xD;
The squaw who creeps upon women and&#xD;
children when they are sleeping, deserves no&#xD;
answer from the son of a warrior?" was the&#xD;
bold reply.&#xD;
In an instant, the tomahawk of the Mohawk&#xD;
chief glittered in his hand, and the brave youth&#xD;
would never have spoken again, had not help&#xD;
been near.&#xD;
"Hold on there-if ye'd not have an ounce&#xD;
of lead in your old carcass !" cried a voice, as&#xD;
the steel-bearing hand was raised, and at the&#xD;
same moment Malcom, with six of Sir Wil-&#xD;
ham's highlanders, appeared on the scene,&#xD;
well armed and ready for action.&#xD;
"Why does the pale-face interfere with my&#xD;
business ?" asked the chief, haughtily.&#xD;
"Because, in the first place, you were about&#xD;
doing a most cowardly deed ;'in the next place,&#xD;
you are interfering with peaceful travelers,&#xD;
and, thirdly and lastly, as the preacher says,&#xD;
because I choose to. So take yourself and&#xD;
your painted gang away from here, or I'll give&#xD;
you a better reason still for going !"&#xD;
As he said this, Malcom touched the keen&#xD;
hanger by his side, and motioned his men to&#xD;
close up.&#xD;
"These are my prisoners I" said the chief,&#xD;
doggedly.&#xD;
"Then come to Sir William Johnson for&#xD;
them--lie sent me to bring them to him-let&#xD;
that youngster go !" and he leveled his gun at&#xD;
one of the warriors who held the youth.&#xD;
The Indians started back, for they did not&#xD;
like the muzzle of a cocked musket so close to&#xD;
their breasts. The chief saw that lie was&#xD;
overpowered, and sullenly called his men off.&#xD;
"Tell the pale-faced chief that there is a&#xD;
cloud between him and the chief of the Mo-&#xD;
hawks !" said the bitter, fiercely, as he de-&#xD;
icendfe the hill-side.&#xD;
"Keloud of smoke and a quart of whiskey&#xD;
will drive it out of'sight !" said Malcom, whose&#xD;
opinion of the -Indian character was by no&#xD;
means elevated.&#xD;
He now told Dyagetto that she was safe,&#xD;
and that Sir William, hearing of her coming,&#xD;
bad sent him to look for and protect her.&#xD;
Giving her and her children food from his&#xD;
own well-stored haversack, after a brief delay,&#xD;
be started at a rapid pace to recross the river,&#xD;
sot liking to give the Mohawk chief too good&#xD;
a chance to rally men and intercept him ; for&#xD;
Malcom had "served'" on the other side of&#xD;
the water, and knew that one of the best&#xD;
qualities of a soldier is caution.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
hir William Johnson was at dinner. On one&#xD;
hand sat his nephew, Guy Johnson, afterward&#xD;
his son-in-law; on the other, his son John,&#xD;
both young men, full of life and adventure, and&#xD;
&#xD;
as dissipated as young men of rank and means&#xD;
think it necessary to be.&#xD;
An Englishman would as soon think of&#xD;
eating garlic soup as to sit at a table where&#xD;
there was not a round of roast beef. This&#xD;
dish was on the baronet's table, but there was&#xD;
also salmon, trout, wild ducks, geese, turkeys,&#xD;
partridges, quails, venison, etc., for he was&#xD;
quite a fastidious gourmand, and beside, his&#xD;
was an open table, and guests were entertained&#xD;
every day. There were several on this occa-&#xD;
sion, but none worthy of particular nota.&#xD;
Lafferty, his secretary, sat vis-a-vis with Mr.&#xD;
Flood ; his physician, Daly, an ancestor of Pat&#xD;
Daly, sat a little further toward the head of&#xD;
the ioard. Attentive servants were at hand&#xD;
to supply every want.&#xD;
The solid part of the repast was finished,&#xD;
and only Sir William and his son and nephiew&#xD;
remained over their wine, when Pontioch came&#xD;
in, and, in a low tone, communicated some-&#xD;
thing to his master.&#xD;
"Let them be brought in at once !" said tha&#xD;
latter. "I will see them here."&#xD;
The servant withdrew, but soon returned&#xD;
with Malcom and Dyagetto and.her children.&#xD;
The mother had carefully arranged their&#xD;
toilet, as well as her own, so that in their&#xD;
native comeliness they showed but little of the&#xD;
stain of travel.&#xD;
A murmur of pleased wonder broke from&#xD;
the lips of the younger Johnsons, as they&#xD;
looked at the magnificent group, their eyes&#xD;
wandering from the matured beauties of the&#xD;
mother to those just blossoming in the daugh-&#xD;
ter, and then to the erect and warrior-form of&#xD;
young Thayendanegen, whom no presence&#xD;
seemed to abash, and who seemed everywhere&#xD;
to feel that he had no superior; that, indeed,&#xD;
royal blood ran in his veins.&#xD;
Dyagetto advanced with her children by he?'&#xD;
side, until within a few feet of Sir William,&#xD;
and then stopped, waiting to be spoken to. At&#xD;
first she had looked him boldly in the eye,&#xD;
but when his too ardent gaze seemed to scan&#xD;
her form, she dropped her eyes, and the blood&#xD;
rose to her cheeks and darkened their rich&#xD;
transparency.&#xD;
"So, Malcom, you found my friend !" said&#xD;
the baronet.&#xD;
"Just in time to save the top-knot of that&#xD;
young man, Sir William.     Obeying your&#xD;
orders, I kept trace of the old Mohawk, who&#xD;
smelt them out before me, and when he&#xD;
thought he had his game set, I stepped in and&#xD;
drew the trumps out of his hand !"&#xD;
"Apd took the 'honors,' my brave fellow.&#xD;
I'll hear your entire report, by-and-bye, in my&#xD;
library. I must check the insolence of that&#xD;
rascal, even if I have to leave a vacancy in the&#xD;
chieftainship of the tribe !"&#xD;
"There should be no vacancy while the soa&#xD;
of Ogahtee lives !" said-Dyagetto, in a tone of&#xD;
calm dignity, but so low that only he heard it.&#xD;
"Peace, wvman I" said Sir William, sternly.&#xD;

though h~e started, and turned pale when she&#xD;
uttered the name. "IIe must not be spoken&#xD;
of, at least for the present!"&#xD;
"Yet he speaks to e from his bloody&#xD;
grave, and bids me demand justice for his&#xD;
son-for my boy l" said the woman, boldly,&#xD;
and her dark eye flashed, and her form seemed&#xD;
to swell to a prouder height when she spoke.&#xD;
"Enough, Dyagetto; no more, until I see&#xD;
you alone !" saia he, speaking to her in her&#xD;
own tongue.                          -&#xD;
She bowed her head and was silent.&#xD;
"What a noble-looking boy; he seems born&#xD;
for a warrior !" said Guy Johnson, as he look-&#xD;
ed at Thayendanegea.&#xD;
"But how very beautiful is his sister !"&#xD;
said John Johnsoa, whose admiring eye was&#xD;
fixed upon her.&#xD;
And she, too, was gazing upon him, but it&#xD;
was in wonder, for he was dressed very richly,&#xD;
withal was handsome, and she never before&#xD;
had seen a being beside her brother, who&#xD;
looked so noble as he did. She did not con-&#xD;
strue his ardent gaze in the manner which one&#xD;
who knew of the world and its ways would ;&#xD;
therefore her eyes were not east down, nor did&#xD;
a blush rise to express emotions of anger or of&#xD;
mortification.&#xD;
But Dyagetto saw the look, divined his&#xD;
thoughts, and quickly said:&#xD;
" We will retire, my children ; when Sir&#xD;
William wishes to see me, he can send for me !"&#xD;
"See to their comfort, Malcom," said the&#xD;
baronet; "have rooms assigned them, and tell&#xD;
the steward to see that they are refreshed.&#xD;
And keep a guard about, not upon them, but&#xD;
for them! The old Mohawk chief is crafty&#xD;
and dangerous !"&#xD;
The soldier's salute was his only reply, as&#xD;
he turned upon his heel and left the room,&#xD;
followed by the Indian woman and her chil-&#xD;
dren.&#xD;
"That boy steps as proudly as a king,"&#xD;
said Guy, as Thayendanegea strode away.&#xD;
"There is kingly blood in his veins !" said&#xD;
Sir William, but he did not speak of them&#xD;
again during the course of the meal-&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
Foiled in his intentions against Dyagetto&#xD;
and her children, by the opportune arrival&#xD;
and action of Malcom, the old Mohawk chief&#xD;
sullenly returned to his village. It was on&#xD;
the banks of the rushing stream which bore&#xD;
the name of his tribe, nestled in amid gentle&#xD;
slopes which were covered with corn, melons,&#xD;
etc., and few, to look upon the neat houses, the&#xD;
tasteful enclosures, the well-laden fruit trees,&#xD;
would have deemed that none but savages&#xD;
dwelled there. This proved that the red man&#xD;
could imitate the pate-face in the procurement&#xD;
of comforts-alas, that he can so readily also&#xD;
&#xD;
imitate the vices of the white man; for, physi&#xD;
ally, he is far the noblest of the two.&#xD;
When lie arrived, lie dismissed the warriors,&#xD;
who had been with him, with a caution to be&#xD;
silent about the occurrences of the morning,&#xD;
and then sent for his son, a warrior almost in&#xD;
age, if not in action, for he was at least five&#xD;
years the senior of Thayendanegea. Ie was&#xD;
tall and powerful in appearance, yet there was&#xD;
no true nobility in his appearance, for the ex-&#xD;
pression of his countenance told of a low and&#xD;
crafty nature, of a disposition lacking open&#xD;
courage, manliness, and generosity. His dress&#xD;
redolent of ornament, and his face without a&#xD;
sear, and ornamented weapons without marks&#xD;
of use, told as much of his character as I could&#xD;
describe in half a chapter.  '&#xD;
" Ipisico," said the old chief, as his son en-&#xD;
tered his lodge, from which he had sent out&#xD;
the women previously, " when the Great&#xD;
Spirit takes me up to the happy hunting-&#xD;
grounds, who will be a chief in my stead? who&#xD;
be the head man of the Mohawks ?"&#xD;
"Why doe    my father ask?" replied the&#xD;
young Indian.' "Who but Ipisico will then&#xD;
be chief?"&#xD;
"Another may claim the place ?"&#xD;
"But he will have no right. I am thy son!"&#xD;
"Yet another livis who will claim that his&#xD;
right is better than that of Ipisico !"&#xD;
" Tihe Mohawks will not listen to him I"&#xD;
" If his story, truly told, goes to the Mo-&#xD;
hawks' ears, they will know him as chief, and&#xD;
bid Ipisico hide his head S"&#xD;
"Who is lie? He must die !"&#xD;
' a isico now speaks like a warrior ! Let&#xD;
him act as. such! Yes, the boy who would&#xD;
fill the place of Ipisieo, must die, and Ipisico&#xD;
must slay him !"&#xD;
"Yes, where does he sleep!" said Ipisico,&#xD;
eagerly.&#xD;
"Would you fear to slay him, were he&#xD;
awake and standing before you ?' asked the&#xD;
old chief, with a touch of-sarcasm in his tone&#xD;
"Oh, no I Ipisico knows no fear !" said the&#xD;
young Indian, and even as he spoke, he glanced&#xD;

hear his boast. "'Where is this pretende?"&#xD;
" In the castle of the great pale face, pro.&#xD;

"Who is lie ?"&#xD;
" The son of Ogahtee, whose place I fill!"&#xD;
'"My father dreams. Ogahtee's son died&#xD;

"Not so-a woman's prayer saved his life&#xD;
He is the tree across thy path!"&#xD;
"'Which I will cut away 1" said Ipisico. In&#xD;
a bitter tone, for he had too long and im-&#xD;
patiently looked for the day when lie should&#xD;
be chief, to be willing to lose it without a&#xD;
struggle, coward even 'though he was by&#xD;

"Yes, it must be done, and by thy hand&#xD;

Ch APTER VI.&#xD;
After hA had dined, and learned that the ne-&#xD;
essities of )yangetto and her family had been&#xD;

"Not even' lie, the mu rdcerer of'rmy Ihusbanld&#xD;
and the usurper of his place, whom, even you,&#xD;
have protected-vou who have fed in my&#xD;
husband's wignam, and slept while he watched&#xD;
over you ! You asked me why I came back&#xD;
from the Mirnamis ? It was to look once more&#xD;
upon the grave of my husband, to see tlr&#xD;

of the cool waters of my birth-place ! Te&#xD;
bring my children here, where you ungiht set&#xD;
them. and when I laid down beside my Ogah&#xD;
tee, as soon I shall, that you might'be just&#xD;
and protect them who were without father o&#xD;
mother !"&#xD;
fir William seemed strangely affected winle&#xD;
the noble Indian woman spoke in a tone ofim.-&#xD;
passionled earnestness. After some moment.&#xD;
of agitation, he spoke:&#xD;
" Dyagetto, you have been deeply wronged--&#xD;
I have been a party to much of your wrong ;&#xD;
but policy and circumstances drove me to&#xD;
much which I would recall, were it possible.&#xD;
But you have come to me for justice and pro.&#xD;
tection. The last you shall have, and the first,&#xD;
so far as it is in may power to render!"&#xD;
'Shall Thayendanegea fill the place of&#xD;
his father, ani shall the scalp of that father's&#xD;
murderer dangle from his lodge-pole ?" asked&#xD;
the woman, eagerly, asking, mother-like, all&#xD;
for her son, and nothing for herself.&#xD;
"In time he shall know that he is chief of&#xD;
the Mohawks, and the tribe shall know it, and&#xD;
then, if he becomes the warrior which his looks&#xD;
now promise-"&#xD;
lie has the soul of Ogalitee-his heart is&#xD;
big, and lie is brave !" said the proud mother.&#xD;
"' Then he shall have my aid to place him&#xD;
where his brave father stood-ray aid to&#xD;
avenge Ogahtee's death !"&#xD;
The haughty pride of the Indian woman&#xD;
melted in a moment, and tears sparkled in her&#xD;
great black eyes, while she threw herself upon&#xD;
her knees before the baronet, and pressed his&#xD;
hands to her lips.&#xD;
" Dyagetto thanks the great chief for his&#xD;
promise !" she said, in broken accents, for she&#xD;
was sobbing With joy.&#xD;
Sir' William lifted her up, and bade her be&#xD;
seated again.&#xD;
"The time for this has not yet come !" he&#xD;
continued, " nor must Thayendanegen yet&#xD;
know who or what he is. I do not yet ab-&#xD;
solve you from your promise of seeresy, for&#xD;
Ie must be educated and prepared for his&#xD;
position. I will confide in Dyagetto, for I&#xD;
know that sine is good and wisO-she will n't&#xD;
speak to other ears what I give to her's&#xD;
alone !"&#xD;
"A chain is upon Dyagetto's tongue when&#xD;
the great chief wills it !" replied the woman.&#xD;
"Then I will speak. The colonies, begin-&#xD;
ning to feel their strength, are already almost&#xD;
in open rebellion against our father, the king,&#xD;
beyond the seas. A war is almost certain, a&#xD;
&#xD;
li&#xD;
Y&#xD;
&#xD;
war in which they will strive; but strive in&#xD;
vain, for independence. Many will be loyal,&#xD;
and the king has many warriors whom he&#xD;
will send over to crush the rebellion, and to&#xD;
aid those who are loyal. I know that my red&#xD;
brothers will fight for the king, for he is rich&#xD;
and great, and will make them many presents ;&#xD;
anldtie colonies are poor, and cannot do it.&#xD;
And, in such a war, the chief of the Mohawks,&#xD;
the first tribe of the Six Nations, will be a&#xD;
reaut man ! It is my wish that Thayenda-&#xD;
negea should learn well the language and the&#xD;
arts of the white man, for a great path is be-&#xD;
fore him, and I will put his feet upon it! Is&#xD;
Dvuagetto willing that her children should re-&#xD;
mamn i my family, and be treated as my own&#xD;
are treated ?" l&#xD;
le Indian woman looked him steadily in&#xD;
the fies for some moments before she replied,&#xD;
as if she would read the inmost thoughts of&#xD;
his soul, and then sire said&#xD;
"Dyagetto is willing--the words of the&#xD;
great chief are good in her ears !"&#xD;
"And Dyagetto, too, will make her home&#xD;
beneath my roof."&#xD;
" Dyagetto would live with her people, and&#xD;
be free to go and come as she wills !" replied&#xD;
the woman.&#xD;
"'She shall have her wish," said Sir Wil-&#xD;
liami. "And, now, let Dyagetto go and tell&#xD;
Thayendanegea to come here, for I would&#xD;
talk to him, and put hope and wisdom in his&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
The Indian woman bowed her head, and&#xD;
left tire room.&#xD;
"So far, so good !" said Sir William, when&#xD;
Ie was alone. "I wish old Aroghyadecka&#xD;
,    was out of the way. His son is not to be&#xD;
feared, but rather to be despised. But the&#xD;
old man is crafty, and has made himself popu-&#xD;
lar with iris people. If Thayendanegea were&#xD;
only a few years older, a blow might be struck&#xD;
by his own hand, which, while it placed him&#xD;
at the head of his tribe, would at once raise&#xD;
him to the height of popularity with them."&#xD;
Tire soliloquy of the baronet was inter-&#xD;
rupted by the entrance of the young Indian&#xD;
of whom he spoke.&#xD;
Advancing proudly, with a step at once&#xD;
bold and free, a figure erect as a pine deep-&#xD;
rootel in its ratire soil, and an eye as bright&#xD;
as that of the untamed eagle. Thayendanegea&#xD;
was an object calculated to elicit admiration&#xD;
from any one capable of appreciating manly&#xD;
beauty in one so young.&#xD;
"My mother bade me come to the great&#xD;
-lnet'. I am here !" said the young warrior,&#xD;
standing in an attitude of respect before the&#xD;
baronet.&#xD;
It is well, Thayendanegea," said  Sir&#xD;
William. "I sent for you to say that, hence-&#xD;
forward, you are to dw with me, and I will&#xD;
be to you ars a father "&#xD;
"A fatlhe-!"said the young Indian, quickly&#xD;
-" father   Did you know my father ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
"I did; and I hope yet b see his son like&#xD;
him-a great Warrior."&#xD;
Who was he ?" asked Thayenddnegea,&#xD;
abruptly.&#xD;
"When a pro per time comes, you shall&#xD;
know ; but, till  en, ask no living being a&#xD;
question about hni, nor breathe his name.&#xD;
It is my command."&#xD;
"I cannot speak his name, for it has been&#xD;
hidden from me !" said the youth, sadly.&#xD;
You shall know it, I repeat, at a proper&#xD;
period," said the baronet. "In the meantime,&#xD;
be patient and studious, and prepare to be&#xD;
great in the council and on the war- path,&#xD;
Remember that a great chief has adopted you&#xD;
as a son."&#xD;
"Thayendanegga will not forget," said the&#xD;
young warrior.&#xD;
At that instant, the door of Sir William's&#xD;
room was' opened without a knock, or any&#xD;
ceremony, and Aroghyadeeka and Ipisico en-&#xD;
tered.&#xD;
A frown gathered, like a thunder-cloud,&#xD;
dark and ominous, upon the brow of the&#xD;
Englishman, and bitter words were rising to&#xD;
his lips; but, when he saw that the old Mo-&#xD;
hawk chief wore a look of deep humility, in-&#xD;
stead of his usual defiant expression, and bore&#xD;
a present of very vahable furs, in token of a&#xD;
wish to make peace--as did his son, also-he&#xD;
restrained himself, and waited for an explana-&#xD;
tion of the visit with his usual stoical com-&#xD;
posure.&#xD;
But the eyes of young Thayendanegea&#xD;
almost flashed fire, as he recognized his captor&#xD;
of that morning and the insulter of his mother,&#xD;
and it needed a look and sign of caution from&#xD;
Sir William to make him restrain himself.&#xD;
The old Mohawk and his son advanced in&#xD;
silence, and laid their presents at the feet of&#xD;
Sir Williani, and then retired a few steps, with&#xD;
their eyes down-east, and their looks expres-&#xD;
sive of sorrow.&#xD;
The baronet did not touch the presents,&#xD;
but, with a stern look, regarding them for a&#xD;
time in silence, and then said :&#xD;
"Why is the chief of the Mohawks here&#xD;
after his words of insult yesterday? Does he&#xD;
think that I am a woman, whose memory of&#xD;
wrong can be hushed by a word, or driven&#xD;
away by a repentant look ?"&#xD;
" Aroghryadeeka was a fool! He has eaten&#xD;
his words. His heart is heavy, for he was&#xD;
wrong. The anger of the great chief is like a&#xD;
cloud upon his spirit, and he has brought him&#xD;
presents to ask'him to lift off thi cloud, for it is&#xD;
very dark in the path of Aroghyadecka ! Ho&#xD;
has brought his only son, Ipisico, to the great&#xD;
chief, to be a surety that he will do wrong no&#xD;
more. Let the great chief put him in his&#xD;
school, or make him hunt and fish for him&#xD;
for Ipisico will do his bi hiding " was the i.&#xD;
hawk's reply.&#xD;
Sir William was at a" loss to know what&#xD;
this unusual and unexpected humility meant&#xD;

&#xD;
Sir William now filled a second glass of&#xD;
brandy, and the reconciliation was complete,&#xD;
so far as outward appearance indicated. The&#xD;
Indian soon after took his leave, and then the&#xD;
baronet sent for his steward, and gave particu-&#xD;
lar directions regarding the disposition and&#xD;
treatment of the recent accessions to his family.&#xD;
He then bade him send Thayendanegea to&#xD;
him-also Mr. O'Whackem, the schoolmaster.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
The schoolmaster was the first to make&#xD;
his appearance, perhaps because he scented&#xD;
brandy, for the baronet never failed to pro-&#xD;
duce that article when he was in a good&#xD;
humor, and it is not in the creed of any true&#xD;
Irishman to refuse a glass of good liquor. -&#xD;
"I sent for you," said the baronet, when&#xD;
Mr. O'Whaekem entered, "to instruct you&#xD;
that you will have three new pupils in the&#xD;
morning."&#xD;
"Male or faymale, Sir William ?"&#xD;
"Both-two young Indians-one, the son&#xD;
of the Mohawk chief; the other, a boy whom&#xD;
I have adopted, a regular eagle, who will be&#xD;
apt to stick his talons into you if you are too&#xD;
rough 'with him-so I deem it best to warn&#xD;
you. His sister you will instruct with the&#xD;
same care and gentleness which you'bestow&#xD;
upon my own daughters!"&#xD;
"Your directions shall be duly attinded to,&#xD;
Sir William !" said the pedagogue, with a&#xD;
backward scrape of his foot, and a forward&#xD;
snap of his head, which would have endan-&#xD;
gered a neck more slin than his.&#xD;
"Take a glass of brandy-help yourself&#xD;
from the table there !" said the baronet.&#xD;
O'Whackemn dutifully obeyed the -order,&#xD;
without the slightest hesitation. While he&#xD;
was drinking it off, Thayendanegea entered.&#xD;
"Why did the son of Dyagetto leave the&#xD;
room so abruptly, with a cloud on his face, a&#xD;
little time ago ?" asked the baronet.&#xD;
"My heart was hot, for I saw an enemy&#xD;
before me !" replied the boy.&#xD;
" Thayendanegea must learn to curb his&#xD;
passion in my presence I" said the baronet,&#xD;
sternly,&#xD;
"Will the mountain torrent stop when the&#xD;
great chief tells it to do so? Will the eagle.&#xD;
pause in its flight toward the sun when he&#xD;
calls to it? Can he tell the clouds not to&#xD;
rain, the winds to cease, and will they obey&#xD;
him ?"t&#xD;
"No! But Thayendanegea lb neither the&#xD;
rushing stream nor the elanless winds !"&#xD;
"The hot thoughts of his heart are more&#xD;
free than they !"&#xD;
"They must be curbed, and Thayendanegea&#xD;
must learn patience, else he will not be the&#xD;
great warrior which I would make of him1"&#xD;
&#xD;
" Thayendanegea will try, but do not ask&#xD;
him to touch hands with Iis enemy.' his&#xD;
heart will not hold a lie I"&#xD;
"I do not require that--but the son of&#xD;
Dyagetto must make no quarrels in my house.&#xD;
Ipisico will dwell here, and if you do not like&#xD;
him, avoid him, but make no quarrel I"&#xD;
"I care not for him-he is a squaw, and&#xD;
dare not look me in the eye. But Iis father&#xD;
spoke bitter words to my mother, and I will&#xD;
kill him for it yet Y"&#xD;
"Bide your time, boy, bide your time !"&#xD;
said the old baronet, who could not help ad-&#xD;
miring the truthful candor of the   outh.&#xD;
"You can go now-to-morrow you will com-&#xD;
mence to study."&#xD;
Thayendanegea slightly bowed his head,&#xD;
and turned away.&#xD;
"What d~o you think of him, O'Whackem?"&#xD;
asked Sir William, after Thayendanegea had&#xD;
gone out.&#xD;
"By my faith, sir, I belave there is a spice&#xD;
of the divil in him. I nivir saw such an eye&#xD;
in a human, before-it looks lane through&#xD;
ye!"&#xD;
"There is more intelligence expressed in&#xD;
his face than in that of any Indian whom I&#xD;
ever saw before. ; I wish his education care-&#xD;
fully attended to !"&#xD;
"It shall be dorA, Sir William. Is it the&#xD;
classics ye'd have me induct him into as well&#xD;
as the lower branches ?"&#xD;
"No-the more useful branches ! Learn&#xD;
him to read and write well, and be particular&#xD;
in his mathematical knowledge,'for he will&#xD;
be a great military leader yet, or my judg-&#xD;
ment is in error !"&#xD;
"And the other one, Sir William--what&#xD;
shall I do with him ?"&#xD;
"The best you can ; but keep a close eye&#xD;
upon his movements and ways. He isa&#xD;
snake and a spy, I expect-but let him have&#xD;
no hint of my suspicions    Take another&#xD;
lass, and leave me, I have letters to write&#xD;
before the carrier leaves for Alban !"&#xD;
"Health and long life to yer honor ! May&#xD;
the day be far off which opens wid sorrow&#xD;
for ye, Sir William!" said O'Whackem, as he&#xD;
tossed off his second bumper, and then strode&#xD;
out of the room.&#xD;
"He is indeed a noble boy, and Dyagetto&#xD;
only uttered truth when she said that Ogah-&#xD;
tee's spirit seemed renewed in hum 1" solilo-&#xD;
qui ed Sir William, when he was once more&#xD;
alone. "He is destined to be a great Tian,&#xD;
and it is for me to help him up the hill  He&#xD;
is already an orator--no one, in attitude or&#xD;

THAYENDANEGEA, THE SCOURGE, OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
The steward of Sir William introduced On-&#xD;
alova to his two daughters, and caused the&#xD;
housekeeper to prepare for her at apartment&#xD;
near theirs. The Indian girl was not so much&#xD;
of a curiosity to them, as they were to her,&#xD;
for, born of a fair and flaxen-haired German&#xD;
another, they were more white and more behu-&#xD;
tiful in their style than anything she had ever&#xD;
dreamed of before. Their dress, though plain,&#xD;
was very rich to her eye, and far more beauti-&#xD;
ful than that which she wore; but when Kath.&#xD;
leen, the youngest, playfully dressed her in&#xD;
one of her own gowns, and put stockings and&#xD;
shoes upon her feet, poor Onalova felt as if&#xD;
she was in chains. Ilcr own garb best suited&#xD;
the free action of her lithe figure and sym-&#xD;
metrical liu.bs. And we are fain to say that&#xD;
no fashion in the world so becomes a faultless&#xD;
figure as that of an Indian maiden. The&#xD;
fringed jacket, fitting, but not compressing&#xD;
the bust and waist; the full skirt descending&#xD;
to or below the knee; the beaded moccasins,&#xD;
the mantle of munny hued feathers, the flower-&#xD;
wrought wreath, over black and flowing&#xD;
tresses, all adorn beauty far more than hoops&#xD;
and bustles, flounces and laces, ribbons and&#xD;
gew-gaws.   This is'may opinion ladies of&#xD;
fashion, get trad at it if yon like.&#xD;
The daughters of Sir William, Kathleen&#xD;
and Leonore, who had been brought up in&#xD;
great seclusion, were very much delighted at&#xD;
the thought of having a young companion&#xD;
whom they were told to treat as kindly as if&#xD;
she were their sister; and Onalova did not&#xD;
feel sad or lonely when her mother told her&#xD;
she was going to visit her tribe and relatives&#xD;
for a few days, they were so very kind to&#xD;
her.&#xD;
All of the afternoon of the first day was&#xD;
s ent by them in arranging and ornamenting&#xD;
0nalova's room, according to their ideas of&#xD;
comfort and taste.&#xD;
Onalova looked on with astonishment and&#xD;
wonder, for she was so all unused to luxury&#xD;
and ornament, other than the flowers and&#xD;
gems of nature, and the feathers, and furs, and&#xD;
painted larks which her brother had given&#xD;
her, that these things seemed to her more&#xD;
beautiful than would the furniture of a palace&#xD;
to a peasant girl, fresh from her homely cot.&#xD;
And, unlike a warrior, or even her brother,&#xD;
who was a warric.r in embryo, who would let&#xD;
nothing force an utterance of astonishment&#xD;
from their lips, her words of surprise and&#xD;
pleasure were frequent and many. This de-,&#xD;
lighted the other girls, who literally despoiled&#xD;
their own rooms and wardrobes to furnish&#xD;
hers. After all was dose, Kathleen cried :&#xD;
a Now, Onalo a, dreas me in your style ; I&#xD;
wish to see how I will look in your dress !"&#xD;
"The Pale-Rose is very beautiful-I love&#xD;
her !" said the Indian girl, as she hastened to&#xD;
perform the desired toilet. "Will she be my&#xD;
aster ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, and Leonore, also-we will both b&#xD;
sisters to you. We will learn you to write,&#xD;
and draw, and play the harpsichord, and you&#xD;
shall learn us to bead moceasins, and work&#xD;
porcupine quills on the white fawn-skins, and&#xD;
make feather wreaths and capes."&#xD;
Soon Kathleen, who was very beautiful in&#xD;
face and form, was arrayed in the robes of&#xD;
Onalova, and they added to rather than de-.&#xD;
tracted from her natural loveliness. Her full&#xD;
bust and well-turned limbs were revealed just&#xD;
enough by the proportions of the dress to&#xD;
show how exquisitely she was formed, and&#xD;
her gold-hued ringlets fell down upon her&#xD;
white neck and shoulders Rs bright as sun-&#xD;
light upon snow. Leonore, who was ever&#xD;
the most quiet or the saddest of the two, was&#xD;
in ecstacies, and declared that she, too, must&#xD;
have a dress like that of Onalova. But we&#xD;
will leave them for an instant, for I wish to&#xD;
keep an eye upon the hero of my story.&#xD;
When Thayendanegea left the presence of&#xD;
Sir William the second time, he was met in&#xD;
the hall by John and GuV Johnson, the son&#xD;
and nephew before alluded to. Both greeted&#xD;
him with kindness, and the elder, John, said:&#xD;
"You must be my brother, Thayendane&#xD;
gea !&#xD;
"And mine also !" added Guy.&#xD;
The young Indian'regarded them both at.-&#xD;
tentively for a few moments, then he extended&#xD;
his hand to John, and looking coldly at Guy,&#xD;
said :&#xD;
" One brother is enough for me&#xD;
Guy reddened with mortification, or anger,&#xD;
perhaps with both ; but John good-naturedly&#xD;
said :&#xD;
"If he is my brother, Guy, he is your&#xD;
cousin still !"&#xD;
"Be a brother to him !" said Thayenda-&#xD;
negea, pointing to Ipisico, who, dressed in alA&#xD;
his tawdry finery, stood near them, but not&#xD;
looking half so noble as Dyagetto's son, in his&#xD;
plain garb&#xD;
" I will, and you may regret the hint'"&#xD;
muttered Guy, as he went and joined the son&#xD;
of the old chief.&#xD;
- Come and look at our horses !" said John&#xD;
to Thayendanegea. "Do you love to ride ?"&#xD;
he added, as he led the way to the stables.&#xD;
"Yes! the wild horses from the plains, that&#xD;
fly like the wind, arid shake the ground with&#xD;
their mighty leaps ! Yes, such ones I love&#xD;
to ride !"&#xD;
"Then we've got one that will snit you,"&#xD;
said the young man--" one that no one&#xD;
dares to back. - He is so fierce and wild,&#xD;
that the grooms fear to take him from tho&#xD;
stable !"&#xD;
"I will ride him!I" said Thayendaneges,&#xD;
quietly,&#xD;
"But I tell you he is ungovernable !"&#xD;
" I will tame him 1"&#xD;

"Mr father will let none of us mount, or&#xD;
try to mount hiii! !'&#xD;
""I w. . ride hint!" said the yonng Indian,&#xD;
so fiercely, that his companion was for the&#xD;
me'nct startled.&#xD;
In a few moments they were at the stables,&#xD;
where Sii William's magnificent stud of sad-&#xD;
dIe and carriage horses were kept. There&#xD;
vere imported hunters, heavy draught horses&#xD;
from  Flandkrs, and  the stocky lint agile&#xD;
ponies front Canadha. But the eves of the young&#xD;
Inlian pissed these over with scarce a glance.&#xD;
He looked for the tamneless steed which no&#xD;
one dared to ride. And his dark eyes flashed&#xD;
proudly lawhen he saw it-a black stallion,&#xD;
without a spot of white, in form the perfec-&#xD;
titn of syietry--deep-ehested, thin-faniiked,&#xD;
with a saill head, a fiery eye, and great nos-&#xD;
trits, which distended with anger at the ap-&#xD;
proach of man, as if to speak his hate of those&#xD;
who held him in bondage. His glossy mane&#xD;
and tail swept nearly to the ground, and his&#xD;
slender limhs revealed their sinewy strength&#xD;
in mnc)le rathei- than in size. IIe was fasten-&#xD;
ed to the strong posts at the head of the stall&#xD;
by a halter of chain, for rope would not hold&#xD;
hin.&#xD;
"Bring me a bridle !" said Thayendanegen,&#xD;
while be surveyed the miagniicent animal&#xD;
with looks of the keenest admiration.&#xD;
"You rannw! bridle him-all the men about&#xD;
the stable could not do it!'&#xD;
Where are your bridles ?" was the only&#xD;
reply that Thayendanegea condescended to&#xD;
make.&#xD;
At the call of the young Englishman, a&#xD;
groom a proached, vho, in obedience to his&#xD;
order. brought a bridle; but w hen he was&#xD;
toll that it. was the intention of the young&#xD;
Indian to ride the black'stallion, Vesuvius, he&#xD;
was imirror-strieken.&#xD;
It is impossible to bridle him, letalone the&#xD;
ridiiig of him !" said the man.&#xD;
"You talk, I do !" said Thayendanegea,&#xD;
snatching the bridle froni his hand, and a&#xD;
heavy whip, which he carried.    He then&#xD;
boldly entered the stall.&#xD;
"(Gol ! the beast will kick his brains out,&#xD;
or gnaw him up with his teeth !" cried the&#xD;
gromo, as sonic of the other servants hurried&#xD;
to the spot&#xD;
But the young hero did not heed these re-&#xD;
marks. 1k went boldly to the head of the&#xD;
horse, which snorted with anger, and quiver-&#xD;
ed in every limb, as if about to try and burst&#xD;
fromtthsstrong chain which was strapped to&#xD;
its glo ssy nbeck. But looking right into its&#xD;
fiery eye, and laying his haiid learlessly n1&#xD;
its mae, the brave mad stroked it gently:;&#xD;
and when it reared up. and tried to plunge&#xD;
son hn  wit hi its fore feet, lie scarcely&#xD;
t'otvel, more than to avoid them, and as its&#xD;
heal catme down, by an adroit movement&#xD;
shi pled the hit in its mouth, and!. the bridle&#xD;
upon its heal, tlhro*ing the reins back upon&#xD;
the neck, ready for use.&#xD;

&#xD;
THE WAR-EAGLE OF THE MOIIAWKS&#xD;
&#xD;
The exclamations of the gi ooms, who wit-&#xD;
nessed an act which none of them would hav.&#xD;
the courage to perform, drew still more wit-&#xD;
nesses to the extraordinary spectacle. but a&#xD;
moment after all dispersed with a shout of&#xD;
terror, and sought places of safety, when they&#xD;
saw Thayendanegea. deliberately cast off the&#xD;
chain from the neck of the dreaded animal&#xD;
and lack him, rearing and plunging as he&#xD;
was, from the stall into the open space o'-ts&#xD;
side of the stable.&#xD;
The moment that he was clear of the build,&#xD;
ing, Thayendanegea leaped upon the back of&#xD;
the fiery animal, which made one or tw&#xD;
maddened bounds, and then stood for an in&#xD;
stant foaming and gnashing its teeth and&#xD;
trembling with fury before the front of the&#xD;
mansion, upon the porch of which Sir William&#xD;
and his family now stood, drawn out by the&#xD;
cries of the men at the stable.&#xD;
"Good heavens, the boy is mad ! Vesu-&#xD;
viis will kill him.!" cried the  baronet, im&#xD;
alarm for his new protege.&#xD;
And by the wild plunges which the mad-&#xD;
dened stallion now made--now leaping wits&#xD;
all four feet from the ground-then rearing&#xD;
and whirling in circles around-then lung.&#xD;
ing forward and kicking its heels high in the&#xD;
air, it would seem as if no rider could keep a&#xD;
seat upon its back.&#xD;
The daughters of Sir William screamed iD&#xD;
terror, and even Onalova, brave as she nata.&#xD;
rally was, and used to danger qs well as co.&#xD;
nisant of, and confident in her brother's ski&#xD;
held her breath when she saw how terrible&#xD;
the wild steed struggled to throw him.&#xD;
Bnt calmer than all, composed and easy&#xD;
was the hero of the struggle. Seated as firrnly&#xD;
as if he were a part of the horse, preserving&#xD;
his balance in all of its movements, heallowea&#xD;
it to expend its strength and fire without him.&#xD;
self using a word or a blow. Even when it&#xD;
laid down and tried to roll him off, he only&#xD;
put his feet to the ground, and when it rose,&#xD;
he rose upon its back.&#xD;
Finding all its efforts to cast such a rider&#xD;
useless, the horse, now white with sweat&#xD;
and foam, stood stubbornly still, and made hno&#xD;
further movement.&#xD;
Now lhayendanegea began to quietly urge&#xD;
it to move, talking to it kindly, patting it&#xD;
gently, and touching its tanks with his heels&#xD;
But the stubborn animal would not step froze&#xD;
its sulks. Suddenly, with a wild shrill yelt&#xD;
striking it as heavy as he could with his&#xD;
whip, tin youth loosened his rein, and the&#xD;
horse, as i' terror-stricken, bounded forward&#xD;
like a deer, close followed by the hounds,&#xD;
Yelling and striking the horse at every jnmp,&#xD;
the bold youth sped over the grassy plain at&#xD;
a frightful rate, circling here and there as hie,&#xD;
own will and strong arm enabled him to do,&#xD;
until after a run of twenty or thirty minute%&#xD;
he found that lie had the horse completely&#xD;
under control.  Then drawing him  up, he&#xD;
trotted hii slowly back to the mansion, pute&#xD;

TIIE WAR-EAGLE OF THE MOIIAWKS.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Will my sister give mie her brother for&#xD;
mine ?" asked the Indian girl, artlessly.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, you may have .John ; yes, indeed"&#xD;
"'hen you may have Thayendanegea!"&#xD;
repliel Onalova.&#xD;
A bargain, and witnesses thereunto !" cried&#xD;
a manly voice at the door, and John, who had&#xD;
app roached noisekssiy, and heard the conver-&#xD;
sation, now entered the room with Thayenda-&#xD;
rie"e-.&#xD;
Kaitlileen  uttered a faint 'scream --she&#xD;
wouidnt have been in the fashion if she had&#xD;
not; but Oialova looked as calm and contented&#xD;
as if she felt that she had neither said or done&#xD;
anything which was worth a scream era blush.&#xD;
And, cont lasted with those pale-faced beau-&#xD;
ties, sel seemed far the loveliest. Their su-&#xD;
perior in et ture and in elegance of figure, her&#xD;
comt plexion so transparent that each vein&#xD;
could be traced beneath the skin, dark though it&#xD;
was-her large black eyes meltingly soft--her&#xD;
glossy hair of raven hue, as fine as silk--her&#xD;
features classical aid perfect-her expression&#xD;
at once proud, yet gentle and loving in its very&#xD;
dignity, how could she be other than very,&#xD;
very beautiful&#xD;
And so t.htiught the heir to the title and&#xD;
est ate of Sir William Johnson,.and wild and&#xD;
impulsive as he had ever been i his nature,&#xD;
and free from love, if not from passion, he now&#xD;
knew a feeling which had newer entered his&#xD;
heart before. le felt as'if lie loved that poor&#xD;
Indian gihi better than all the world beside.&#xD;
And his feelings, like those of all in their first&#xD;
love, were pure ! No sensuality, no selfishness,&#xD;
no hypocrisy were nixed with them.&#xD;
le now introduced Thayeidandgea to Lis&#xD;
sisters as his adopted brother, and after they&#xD;
had given the young men seats, they did what&#xD;
they could to amuse them. Leonore, who&#xD;
drew and painted well, produced her portfolio&#xD;
and exhhibted her drawings and sketches,&#xD;
while Kat hileen brought out various eibroid-&#xD;
cries, im which sie greatly excelled.&#xD;
The dark eye of' whayendanegeawandered&#xD;
carelessly-over all the drawins, which were&#xD;
landscapes and sketches of birds and flowers,&#xD;
until at last it came to a spirited battle scene,&#xD;
eolpied by her from some old painting. Then&#xD;
his eye flashed, and as it noted each figure of&#xD;
man and horse, the living and the slain, lie&#xD;
uttered the word:&#xD;
"Good! .They fight!I"&#xD;
Poor Kathleen felt not a little mortified&#xD;
that lie did not speak a word of praise in re-&#xD;
gard to her work, and she thought it strange&#xD;
that the young Indian scarcely looked at her&#xD;
or her sister, and then manifested no acknow-&#xD;
ledgment "f their beauty-none of the wonder&#xD;
which Onalova had felt and so freely uttered.&#xD;
She was deternined to see if he had any feel-&#xD;
ing, or really was tire stoic which he seemed ;&#xD;
and thought, and justly too, that music would&#xD;
he the surest test; for hard is the heart, and&#xD;
steru the soul, which music will not melt.&#xD;
She brought outlher harpsichord, andon-&#xD;
&#xD;
21&#xD;
&#xD;
meneing  within a low prelude, acconpanied&#xD;
herself to a sweet song. Her voice was rich&#xD;
rand full, and as she sung of love, and she&#xD;
seemed to feel its power, it fairly filled the&#xD;
room with melody. Ier bosou rose and fell,&#xD;
and the color deepened on her cheek as she&#xD;
sung ; but Thayendanegea remained as caln&#xD;
and passive as a stone, looking more at the&#xD;
mechanical action of her fingers upon the in-&#xD;
struient than anything else.&#xD;
Suddenly she changed the theme, and sung&#xD;
an ancient var-song. As her voice rose in&#xD;
this and thrilled out the charge and the bat-&#xD;
tle's clangor, then the young Indian's eyes&#xD;
flashed, and his broad chest heaved, and his&#xD;
nostrils dilated, while his ear seemed to drink&#xD;
in every note.&#xD;
Good !" said he, when she, half exhausted,&#xD;
closed the song.&#xD;
She had touched the right chord of his na..&#xD;
tore   No carpet knight was he to list to&#xD;
pling strains of love, but every inch a war-&#xD;
rror and a man, though time had not yet ap-&#xD;
corded unto hum a warrior's place.&#xD;
Delighted with even that success, Kathleen&#xD;
only paused to recover breath, and then she&#xD;
conmenced another song-a song once more&#xD;
of love.&#xD;
Suddenly the sound of a drum and fife near&#xD;
the house was heard.&#xD;
"What is that ?" asked Thayendanegea,&#xD;

tial music, all forgetful that Kathleen was&#xD;
singing.&#xD;
"Malcom   is mustering the men for the&#xD;

"Let us go-I like that music-I want to&#xD;
see them! Can they fight?"&#xD;
"They did in the war with the French P'&#xD;
"I must see them! I love to look at war-&#xD;
riors ." said Thayendanegea, not appearing to&#xD;

degree.&#xD;
Young Johnson would gladly have lingered&#xD;
there longer, so as to have conversed with&#xD;
Onalova, hut the impatience of her brother&#xD;
could not be checked, and the two young&#xD;
men went out to attend the parade of the&#xD;

fiture related at the close of the eighth chapter.&#xD;
And as he went he bit his lips until the blood&#xD;
ran from therm, and actually wept from anger&#xD;
and msrtificatioh. And curses, bitter and deep,&#xD;
and al too wild for utterance from ips so&#xD;
young, burst forth as he passed on, until he&#xD;
reached a mossy bank, beneath the shade'of ,&#xD;
some tall pines, upon which he east himself.&#xD;

{pisico.&#xD;
"M v heart is sad for my brother, and&#xD;
angry ~with his enemy !" said the youig In-&#xD;
alan.&#xD;
Whie is my enemy ?" asked Guy, angerly.&#xD;
W 'V ho but this Tyencudanegen, who is also&#xD;
cy enemy-who but he, that comes fro-i no&#xD;
cne knws where, and is no one knows what?&#xD;
Who but he '&#xD;
"True, Ijisico, he is an unknown upstart ;&#xD;
but I will humble his pride ! I'll take the&#xD;
starch out of his ruffles ? et !" cried Guy.&#xD;
" I will kill him for my brother-will watch&#xD;
him close, and w hen he sleeps my knife shall&#xD;
drink his blood!'&#xD;
"  o-tlhat will not do here! My uncle&#xD;
has taken a fancy to him, and were ias brood&#xD;
gbed, he would find all out, and hang any one&#xD;
"oneerned in the deed, even if it were me, his&#xD;

white peomiy in the stable which belongs to mny&#xD;
cousin Kathleem, for she, too, dared to taunt&#xD;
une when I was thrown, I will be revenged&#xD;
upon all of them. I care not what it costs !"&#xD;
"My brother is a great brave ! And so am&#xD;
r. I will help him to crush his enemies ! My&#xD;
heart is big, and I fear nothing !" said IJpisico,&#xD;
dwelling up as proudly as a peacock on a&#xD;
Unniy morning in a clover field.&#xD;
'  'Ie son of Arog hyadecka lies !" said a&#xD;
dep, hollow voice in the rear, and both or&#xD;
the young mn sprang to their feet, and&#xD;
looked around to see from whence the voice&#xD;
proceeded.&#xD;
No one was in sight. Guy turned as pale&#xD;
as a sheet and trembled with fear, while Ipisi-&#xD;
co seenwd even more terrified than he.&#xD;
"What was it ?" asked Guy, in a hoarse&#xD;
whisper.&#xD;
"A spirit-let us go from here!'' said Ipisi-&#xD;
aa, while his teeth clattered together with his&#xD;
shivering fear.&#xD;
'-Stay I" said the same voice, in a hollow&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"The Lord save us - what can it be ?"&#xD;
ped Guy, and he sunk down to the ground&#xD;
m the very weakness of his abject fear.&#xD;
Ipisico also cowered down to the earth,&#xD;
and drew his embroidered blanket over his&#xD;
head, as if to hide front his view some horri-&#xD;
ble vision which liis terror painted to his&#xD;
Mind.&#xD;
"Who spoke" at last said Guy, gathiering&#xD;
wurage, because he saw some one npproach-&#xD;
ng, at a distance, from toward the mansion.&#xD;
'o this question'he received no reply, and&#xD;
seeiniz that those who were approaching were&#xD;
ao other than his uncle and the schoolmaster,&#xD;
who frequently walked in the grove while&#xD;
&#xD;
they talked and smoked their evening pipsa1&#xD;
he said&#xD;
"Rlouxepip, Ipisico, rouse up, and act like a&#xD;
man. I'm mict ai'ad .&#xD;
m'Tis false !t s tithe same hollow voice,&#xD;
and Guy, even though his uncle was now&#xD;
c:ose by, started from the spot, niid hurried&#xD;
away, as if death was in the very atmosphere&#xD;
of the liace- ..&#xD;
" W hat the deuce is the matter here ? My&#xD;
nephew running away like a scared sheep,&#xD;
and this cub Inian doubled u  in a heap,&#xD;
with his blanket over his head ." cried air&#xD;
William, as lee approached the spot.&#xD;
"Get up, Ipisico. What are you trembling&#xD;
for ?"&#xD;
"A spirit, great chief, a spirit ." moaned&#xD;
the Indian.&#xD;
"The spirit of the devil !"&#xD;
Yes, great clef, yes-it spoke to us!-&#xD;
" Here, you Guy, conic back hIe;e and tell&#xD;
us what tis means !" shouted Sir John to h.s&#xD;
nephew, who was yet within call, although&#xD;
hurrying toward the house.&#xD;
With a downcast face, anid a shCeepish ex-&#xD;
pression, the young ian came back and told&#xD;
Sir Wilhiam that, wlne he and lpisico were&#xD;
talking, a stratige voice spoke to them, and&#xD;
not being able to discover any oue, they&#xD;
were frghleiied, because they believed it to&#xD;
be a spirit.&#xD;
"You are both fools and cowards !" said&#xD;
Sir William, contemptuously, for he was no&#xD;
believer iii spirits. " Look around among&#xD;
the trees, O'W hacker, and see if there is any&#xD;
one about! "&#xD;
" livil the one, Sir William !" replied the&#xD;
latter.after making athoroughsearch. "Per-&#xD;
haps they were a plotting soie kind o' mis-&#xD;
chief, and 'twas the voice of conscience that&#xD;
spoke to 'emc. I've heard of the likes o' that&#xD;
-of voices that wouldn't let the murderer&#xD;
slape, or the wicked one rest! "&#xD;
"They had better beware how they plot&#xD;
any mischief, or attempt to execute it on my&#xD;
domainn" sail Sir Wilhiam, sternly. "I will&#xD;
make brief trial and speedy punshment re-&#xD;
dress all evil here ! Of that, Master Guy, you&#xD;
and your friend can reniain assured !"&#xD;
Having said this, lee walked on, and soon&#xD;
disappeared in the darker recesses of the&#xD;
grove, with OYWhaekem, while Guy and his&#xD;
companion hastened to the house, for they&#xD;
dared not stay there.&#xD;
They had been gone but a few moments,&#xD;
when from the thick branches of a short,&#xD;
stumpy spruce, a iian descended. Ills garb&#xD;
and features were those of an Indiani, nut his&#xD;
face was bleached almost to whiteness, as if&#xD;
by long ilhiess or confinement. his frame&#xD;
was attenuated, his eyes sunken, and his hair&#xD;
long and white as snow. IIe looked the very&#xD;
picture of one Iwho had suffered long, and be-&#xD;
come old before his tune.&#xD;
lie said nothing, but shook his clenched&#xD;
hand threateningly in the direction which had&#xD;
&#xD;
been taken by the young men, and then&#xD;
walked away im a route different from that&#xD;
taken by Sir William, yet one leading into&#xD;
the densest part of the grove. his steps were&#xD;
now and feell, for he seemed half famished&#xD;
and very weak.&#xD;
ChIAPTER XI-&#xD;
When Dyagetto tetnrned to the village&#xD;
from which she had been absent so many&#xD;
years, at first scarce one of her former acquaint-&#xD;
ances, or even her relatives, knew her; for&#xD;
she was young, and exceedingly beautiful,&#xD;
when she suddenly disappeared from them,with&#xD;
her two little children--one a babe, and the&#xD;
other just able to walk. It was on the night&#xD;
after the body of her husband-brutally mur&#xD;
dered, and so disfigured that he could only be&#xD;
recognized by his clothing and weapons-had&#xD;
been discovered near his wigwam; and many&#xD;
supposed that, in her frenzy, she had east her-&#xD;
self and her children into the swift rapids of&#xD;
the "Little Falls" of the Mohawk, near which&#xD;
she dwelt at that time. But some there were&#xD;
who knew of the ambition of one man in the&#xD;
tribe, and of his emnity to Ogahtee, who had&#xD;
won Dyagetto, though the first was also a&#xD;
suitor for her hand, who felt more than a mere&#xD;
suspicion that he had removed her and the&#xD;
heir to the chieftainship of Ogahtee, that he&#xD;
might, through a strange influence which he&#xD;
held over Sir William Johnson, the king's su-&#xD;
perintendent, be elevated to the murdered&#xD;
chieftain's place. And though Arogh yadecka&#xD;
got the place, and was brave, wise, and politic,&#xD;
and, by his liberality to his tribe and his own&#xD;
self-denial, managed to become popular with&#xD;
most of his peole-althiough, as I said be&#xD;
fore, sonic there were who regarded him with&#xD;
dark suspicion; for the murderer of Ogahtec&#xD;
was never known with certainty, although the&#xD;
charge was laid to an Onondago Indian, who&#xD;
disappeared that night from their village,&#xD;
where he had a squaw, and was never seen&#xD;
again.&#xD;
But when Dyagetto told her name, and her&#xD;
altered features were remembered, great were&#xD;
the rejoicings of her relatives, and warm was&#xD;
the welcome which was given to the widow&#xD;
of the late chief. But when she was ques-&#xD;
tioned about her absence, where had she been,&#xD;
and where were her children, she was silent,&#xD;
on~y telling them that it was not the will of&#xD;
the Great Spirit that she should then inform&#xD;
them, but in time they should know all.&#xD;
They hastily prepared a feast for her, and&#xD;
all of the head women of the tribe gathered&#xD;
there to do her honor. With sad dignity she&#xD;
reeeived and thanked them ; but, while she&#xD;
begged them to eat and be merry, she refused,&#xD;
for, said she:&#xD;
"My heart is very heavy! I remember&#xD;
Ogabtee, and look back through the darkness,&#xD;
&#xD;
and the rain of many tears, to the bright time&#xD;
when lie played the love-wreath upon my&#xD;
head ! Let me go to his grave and weep, and&#xD;
then, when my heart is more light, I willd-&#xD;
come and hear your songs."&#xD;
They could but assent, and honor he' for&#xD;
that sorrow which time could not lessen, but&#xD;
which was still fresh, like the ever-living&#xD;
spring, or that plant which lives while love&#xD;
lives, or the opal-gem w:iieh shines until af-&#xD;
fection dies.&#xD;
And we will leave her to make that sad pil-&#xD;
grimage amid moonlight and shadow--for seat-&#xD;
tered clouds were moving athwart the sky-&#xD;
while we look elsewhere'to the doings of an-&#xD;
other of the characters in our life drama.&#xD;
Down below the Little Falls only a short&#xD;
distance, upon the southern bank of the river,&#xD;
was a deep ravine, which appeared--although&#xD;
no water ran through it then-to have been&#xD;
deeply cut in the lofty precipice of rock which&#xD;
overliangs that bank by a stream, for the marks&#xD;
of the torrent were plainly to be seen in the&#xD;
gullied, and seamed, and smooth-worn rocks&#xD;
on either side. It was a dark and gloomy&#xD;
gorge, too narrow and too rough to invite the&#xD;
tread of man, and so overhung with thick&#xD;
evergreens and tangled vines, that aot even&#xD;
the sun, at mid-day, could pierce its gloom.&#xD;
Into this gorge, on the night of the same&#xD;
day when he had left Ipisieo in the care of&#xD;
Sir William Johnson, at or near the hour, of&#xD;
midnight, old Aroghyadecka might have been&#xD;
seen to enter. His step was light aad can-&#xD;
tious, and ihe frequently looked back to se if&#xD;
any one had followed him or was watching&#xD;
his motions. Ie bore in one hand a willow&#xD;
basket, which contained a quhutity Qf dried&#xD;
meats ; with the other lie carried 11s gun.&#xD;
Slowly up the dark ravine, along a path&#xD;
which nothing but being used to could enable&#xD;
him to tread, he made his way, pausing, every&#xD;
little while, to listen. Along thus lie went,&#xD;
until he reached the face of a rock which&#xD;
seemed to jut out so as to admit of no further&#xD;
passage in that direction, and where the ra-&#xD;
vine narrowed to not more than tea feet at&#xD;
the bottom, and less at the top. With a light&#xD;
bound lie erossed to a ledge upon the other&#xD;
side, turned a projecting corner, and stood in&#xD;
a small cave or recess, which, at a first glance,&#xD;
looked as if it had been quarried out by the&#xD;
hand of man ; yet it was natural.&#xD;
here he paused, and, taking out flint and&#xD;
steel, soon struck a light, and ignited a torch&#xD;
of light-wood, of which there was a small store&#xD;
piled in the cave. Sticking this in a crevice&#xD;
of the rock, he took away a heavy square&#xD;
stone, which lie could barely lift, from the back&#xD;
part of the small cave, and then it could be&#xD;
seen that this was really only the mouth of a&#xD;
large cave beyond, which had been walled up,&#xD;
for from far vithiin the dark and gloomy apace&#xD;
beyond could be heard the sound of falling&#xD;
waters. A buckskin rope appeared to be fas.&#xD;

A hollow groan-a deep and awful sound,&#xD;
which seemed to come right up from the&#xD;
grave beside which he had so lately knelt--&#xD;
broke upon his ear, and choked his utterance&#xD;
in in instant. And it so terrified him that lie&#xD;
fled from the s1ot with a speed which the pur-&#xD;

of him. Without once looking back, or paus-&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
Weeks rolled on, and to Tha'endanegea&#xD;
they did not pass unpleasantly. Pleased within&#xD;
and very attentive to his'studies, he became a&#xD;
great tvorite with Mr. O'Whaekem, who,&#xD;
even had he not been, would not have darea&#xD;
to use the birch upon him as he did upon&#xD;
some other of his pupils, for he had seen&#xD;
enough of the young " Eagle" to pay proper&#xD;
respect to his talons, which were as ieady as&#xD;
his talents.&#xD;
And with the rise of the sun each morning,&#xD;
he led ont his fiery stallion, and, springing&#xD;
upon his back, bounded away for nues over&#xD;
 the plains that lay so level on the plategun&#xD;
above the Mohawk. The horse now seemed&#xD;
to be as fond of his young master as the let-&#xD;
ter was of him-would go and come at his&#xD;
call-kneel for him to mount, and act as gen-&#xD;
tly as a lady's palfrey, without any one else&#xD;
attempted to nount, or even approach him.&#xD;
Not a groom about the stable, or a man upon&#xD;
the premises, could do so, without his relax-&#xD;
ing into his former terrible ferocity. Toward&#xD;
Guy Johnson.ie exhibited a fiercer hatred&#xD;
than to all the rest, and even Thayendanegea&#xD;
could scarcely restrain him from plunging&#xD;
upon him when his eyes fell upon the young&#xD;
man, who, however, took the best of care to&#xD;
keep out of his way.&#xD;
And at night, or rather in the afternoon,&#xD;
when the sun began to sink ira the west, and&#xD;
the cool breezes to breathe amid the trees, the&#xD;
young ladies and their brother John, and Ona-&#xD;
1ova, all well mounted, would gallop out with&#xD;
&#xD;
A'&#xD;
&#xD;
Thavendanegea, and sometimes the old baro&#xD;
net, niounited upon a sturdy hunter, woul4&#xD;
join the cavalcade.&#xD;
At other times, when free from their studies,&#xD;
Joh instructed Thavenda ne rea in the use  f&#xD;
the sword. but soon found that his pupil was&#xD;
his equal if not his master ; and  hean it cane&#xD;
to the use of the tomahawk, the bow, or even&#xD;
the rifle, Thayendanegea hand no equal on fa&#xD;
estate-not one who could even approach to&#xD;
his skill.&#xD;
With two exceptions, the young indian haid&#xD;
not an enemy on the place-not even thr ough&#xD;
envy, that most potent of eieneiv-nukers.&#xD;
The men liked him for his skill, his wiling-&#xD;
ness, good nature, and courage-the women,&#xD;
for his nirly beauty, combined with these,&#xD;
though to them lie paid scarcely any atten-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
The exceptions were Guy Johfson and Ipi.&#xD;
sico. The former lad never foregtiven the first&#xD;
slight put upon him by Tlhavendanegena, nor&#xD;
lis~toss from the lack stallion--nor the son&#xD;
of Aroghvadeeka, that he was looked up inas&#xD;
a "Crow" and a "squaw " by the dashing ana&#xD;
fearless young warrior, who never for a moo-&#xD;
ment, in ay position, attempted to conceal&#xD;
his contempt for him, or his hatrcd of his&#xD;
father I&#xD;
One evening. some four weeks after Thay-&#xD;
endanegen had become a memriber of Sir' Wil-&#xD;
liani's family, the cavalcale alluded to above,&#xD;
incuding Sir William, started upon an even-&#xD;
ing ride. Kathieen was mounted upon her&#xD;
pretty white pony-Leonore upon a more&#xD;
sober hay filly-Onalova npon a icious little&#xD;
spotted pony, as full of " Old Nick" as herself&#xD;
when she wanted to be-John upioni a spirited,&#xD;
blooded animal, imported from England, and&#xD;
Sir William upon his favorite hunter.  Of&#xD;
course, Vesuvius and his bold riderled the&#xD;
van.&#xD;
The evening was Tather close, and the day&#xD;
had been hot, and, as it was that season in the&#xD;
latter part of summer when" sudden thunder-&#xD;
storms are common, the proposed ride was&#xD;
not intended to be a long one.&#xD;
Seated in a shady spot near the house, Guy&#xD;
andihisinscparableIpisico, with lowering looks,&#xD;
watched the gay party as they rode oif, for,&#xD;
though invited by Sir William, they never&#xD;
could he induced'-to join in these rides.except&#xD;
by a positive command, which lie wouhl not&#xD;
give ; for, fowl of enjoyment himself, he would&#xD;
not mar that of others, by forcing up1 on1 thema&#xD;
unwilling and disagreeable eomlany.  For&#xD;
lisagrecable it would have been. Ipisico was&#xD;
not liked by any of the party, for lie lad&#xD;
become morose, sullen, and sulky-and Guy&#xD;
was only liked by one, the gentle Leonore,&#xD;
who hld been a favorite of his father while lie&#xD;
lived, and who, at an early age, had, lay the&#xD;
mutual agreement of the two parent-b.irothers,&#xD;
been betrothed to Guy, whom she was to&#xD;
marry when he arrived at his majority.&#xD;

It was so string that it drove the heavy rain&#xD;

and leaves lyiing through the air, nd drtshei'&#xD;
hundreds of trees in every direction to the&#xD;

"iffy father must not ride on-the great&#xD;

horse past thie oemng, which wtas their only&#xD;

firmly, seized the bridle of the baronet's tnos.&#xD;

space, beckoimng to the others to follow.&#xD;
This .they didl as best they were able, for&#xD;
their terrified horses were ahniost unmainmagea-&#xD;
ble. Yet the black stallion showed to more&#xD;
sign of fear than his master.&#xD;
" By ty life, lad, but thy coolness has&#xD;
saved the hvltke of us !" exclaimed the baro-&#xD;
net, as he dismounted from his horse, and re-&#xD;
garded anxiously the falling trees and luge&#xD;
birancles, which were feehing the force of the&#xD;
hurticaite. "Dismounrt, childrei-your horses&#xD;
tmay start, and it would be death, certain&#xD;
death, to tide along that road now."&#xD;

pony was quite as uneasy as any other of the&#xD;
hoises.&#xD;
Soon she had cause to regret this reckless-&#xD;
ness ;for, as a huge old hemlock came crash-&#xD;
ing to the ground, ut a tfew yards from them,&#xD;
,      the ponu y took fright, and, iii spite of voice&#xD;
and rin, hounded down the road, and she&#xD;
could tot stop hhin.&#xD;
"IDo not moveI" cried Thayenanegea to&#xD;
her terrified father and relatives ; I will save&#xD;
her !'&#xD;
And-ie gave a loose rein to his noble horse,&#xD;
mand. with a word urged him forward. In a&#xD;
monimnt- mnml it was not second too soon--lie&#xD;
war it lier side, fo r a huge old pine, that had&#xD;
nunmbered centuries where it stood, reeled an&#xD;
inst it amid crttnie crashing through the other&#xD;
trees, right toward time spot where she was.&#xD;
With a uianut's strength, thme young Indian bent&#xD;
antd sunched her from the saddle with one&#xD;
n'm, while lie wheeled his horse with the&#xD;
other, and struck himii in the fanks with both&#xD;
heels.  With one mighty bound, the horse&#xD;
leapd brick clear of the danger, while the&#xD;
pony,1 fined front its burthen, bounded for-&#xD;
wrdl, an. escaped being crushed by only a&#xD;
few feta, mmml the ige tree fi'll exactly where&#xD;
she would have ihen had it not been for the&#xD;
arm of    bold young brave.&#xD;
'l'hiaendimneim a, bearing Kathleen. tenderly&#xD;
in his ar'ims-for she was now senseless from&#xD;
terror-"-rode hack to the group itt the clearing,&#xD;
and resigned her to the care of her father amidt&#xD;
sister, who, alitost dumb with fear and anx-&#xD;
iety, had witnessed her peril and her rescue.&#xD;
Gil's life, la I! vou have done a deed of&#xD;
which an' knight in Christendom would bue&#xD;
proud !You have saved my daughter's life&#xD;
Ask tny gif.t i omy power, and it shall be&#xD;

any denial!" cried the overjoyed baronet.&#xD;
"Evetn if it be her hand as thy bride, thou&#xD;
shalt have it '!"-&#xD;
" Thayendanegea asks nothing. The Pale-&#xD;
Rose is safe, and he is contented I" said the&#xD;
brave youth, even though' lier eyes were&#xD;
opening upon him nwiithi a look of love and&#xD;
gr'atitud1, for she had so far recovered as to&#xD;
he'r and understand her father's words.&#xD;
She sighed a she heicard his calm reply, and&#xD;
her bosom rose amndl fell, and the color in her&#xD;
cheeks weit and came, and two pearly tears&#xD;
,      came out of her great blue eyes, and stole&#xD;
silently down ,er cheeks --wherefore, she&#xD;
scarcely md~lred to ask herself.&#xD;
''hie storms passed away almost as rapidly&#xD;
as it hint come m, anid before the hour of the&#xD;
sun's setting arrived, all was still again, and&#xD;
not a cloud obscured its golden path when it&#xD;

&#xD;
resumed their way toward 'Johnsonti  Ul,&#xD;
although they could proceed but slowly it&#xD;
conseqwece of the many fallen trees ieross&#xD;
their path, most of which t hey were olblig d&#xD;
to pass around, for they were so protected by&#xD;
their chevaux-de-frise of' branelis that to leap&#xD;
over them' was frequently itpossible.&#xD;
Night was upon'thembefore they emerged&#xD;
from  the wood, but the bright 'moon and&#xD;
countless stars shone from a cloudless sky,&#xD;
and daikness did not incotmode them  The&#xD;
atmosphere, made'cool and pume lV the elec-&#xD;

ful, and the past danger was anitest forgotten&#xD;
in the pleasure of the present, except hy one,&#xD;
who, silent and half-tearful, rode as near to&#xD;
her preserver as she could. 1 need not say&#xD;
who it was.&#xD;
When the-party arrived at the uall, Tpisico&#xD;
and Guy were on the piazza watching them.&#xD;
"By heaven ! they are a hiback safe !" mut-&#xD;
tered 'Guy, discontentedly, as th hi-rode up.&#xD;
The devil wouldn't hear my primer, or iw&#xD;
of them would have had their nmeks broken I"&#xD;
"The Great Spirit imust have held his hand&#xD;
above them!" said the Indian.&#xD;
"Remember the white pony rtnd the black&#xD;
stallion, to-night!" said Guy,'as he rise and&#xD;
went into the house, so as to avoid the neces-&#xD;
sity of speaking to the party who were dis-&#xD;
mounting.&#xD;
I have spoken, and I will d-o that which&#xD;
my brother wants done !" said the young In-&#xD;

down upon it, mirroring their sweet faces in&#xD;

"Master Guy Johnson, you are the nephew&#xD;

instant ran yelling to the house, pursued by&#xD;
his now heated punisher, who gave him a cut&#xD;
at every leap, and only relinquished the pur-&#xD;
suit when the young villain had entered the&#xD;

"I beg your pardon, Sir William, for using&#xD;
this weapon in your presence, but I've borne&#xD;
insult and injury too long from that fellow to&#xD;
stand more, anJ I'll let no man living call me&#xD;
a liar to my face, when I'm only spaking truth&#xD;
before God and man !"&#xD;
"I do not blame you at all, Daly," said Sir&#xD;
William ; "lie richly deserved more than you&#xD;
gave him, and if lie were not the son of my&#xD;
dead brother, he should not restanotherlhour&#xD;
beneath my roof!"&#xD;
"Would you have me patch up this bit o'&#xD;
disfiguration, Sir William ?" asked the doctor,&#xD;
much pleased at not incurring blame from his&#xD;
patron, while he pointed at Ipisico.&#xD;
" Yes, do the best you can for him. I do&#xD;
not blame him so much now as I did ; for I see&#xD;
plainly that Guy has but used him as a tool&#xD;
in the matter. The Indian knew no better,&#xD;
and Guy did. Use all your care and skill for&#xD;
the poor devil-when he gets able to talk he&#xD;
may tell us all about itI"&#xD;
Ipisico, whose eyes till now had only flash-&#xD;
ed anger and hatred, seemed touched by these&#xD;
words cf the old nobleman, and seizing the&#xD;
hand of the latter, he pressed it to his heart,&#xD;
and looked grateful at him, as if to express&#xD;
thanks for-the one kind expression, when he&#xD;
so little deserved it.&#xD;
"Let the men earety him in carefully,&#xD;
Daly !" said the baronet, "and order any-&#xD;
thimg from my stores which you deem neces-&#xD;
sary."&#xD;
"I'll do all that lays in my power, Sir Wil-&#xD;
liam !" said the doctor, as the baronet return-&#xD;
ed to his house and lbed, for the chill night&#xD;
air did not feel very comfortable to an e orly&#xD;
man, thinly dressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
t"I didn't know that you was a master of&#xD;
two professions before, doctor!" said John&#xD;
Johnson, after his father had left.&#xD;
"It bothers the sowl o' me to know what&#xD;
ye mane, Master John!" said the doctor, with&#xD;
a puzzled look.&#xD;
" Why, you're a doctor to begin with, and&#xD;
,a first-rate dancing-master to boot. I never&#xD;
sa# any one learn a running hornlpipe quicker&#xD;
than cousin Guy did, just now, in all my&#xD;
life ."&#xD;
"Faith, if lie keeps on as he's begun, he'll&#xD;
learn, like Dick Turpin, to dance on nothin'&#xD;
in the end, with a bit o' twisted flax knotted&#xD;
under his ear! One thing is sure, he'll never&#xD;
die like a Christian, in his behl or, like a dacet&#xD;
man, on-the field of honor '"&#xD;
"Maybe he'll challenge you in the morn-&#xD;
ing," said John, with a laugh.&#xD;
" Divil the bit wil lhe. There's no such&#xD;
good luck in store for Pat Daly as to make&#xD;
him die a giatale death, with a bit o' lead&#xD;
snug laid in the right spot. But if he can&#xD;
hire a red nager-I beg your pardon. Master&#xD;
Thayendanegea, it's not the likes o' you I&#xD;
iane, so you needn't look so black at inc---f,&#xD;
I say, he can hire some one to stick a knife&#xD;
into me in the night-time, why he'll be just&#xD;
the one to get that sort o' satisfaction. But&#xD;
I'll be as like a potato as if I was one-bless-&#xD;
ed be the esculent forever, for it's the Pain-&#xD;
disc-apple of my country-eyes all over and&#xD;
none of 'em aslape !"&#xD;
"Hardly would lie dare that!" said John.&#xD;
" The divil trust hifn for all me. The man&#xD;
that would have the throat of a poor baste cut&#xD;
to spite a poor, tender-hearted young lady.&#xD;
wouldn't spase me, I'm sure !" said.thie doctor.&#xD;
While this conversation was going ; on, the&#xD;
physician had been busy in preparing lpisico&#xD;
for removal, and he now bade the men around&#xD;
to take him up carefully, and carry him to&#xD;
the neat little hospital which Sir William had&#xD;
built near his mansion.&#xD;
ChIAPTER XVI.&#xD;
Upon the morning after the occurrences&#xD;
above mentioned, Sir Willit m sent for his&#xD;
nephew, ordering that he should come to hin&#xD;
in his library.&#xD;
After considerable delay, the voung man&#xD;
made his appearance, looking very much as&#xD;
one would who had been caught stealing a&#xD;
sheep, whipping a woman, or in some other&#xD;
equally despicable action.&#xD;
"You are very tardy, nephewv Guy, in&#xD;
obeying my summons, this morning." said&#xD;
Sir William, not angrily, for he had just taken&#xD;
his " morning nip," to get up an appetite for&#xD;
breakfast. " Methiink, if I'd sent Dr. Daly&#xD;
after you, he would have hurried you up a&#xD;
little. He is a famous hand at that! I could&#xD;
but adnire your agility, and his skill, last&#xD;

Guy was startled at the thought of being&#xD;
de1riv. of a ioie, for, if his uncle cast him&#xD;
oil, he was penniless. Moreover, lie loved&#xD;

You can keep back all, sir-I have no&#xD;

the baronet, now thoroughly -m0ry. " Come,&#xD;

with John and your cousins, coming in froi&#xD;
their morning walk. Either go up to him&#xD;
like a man, and isay you are sorry for what&#xD;

around me who can deliberately do a base&#xD;
wrong to another, and refuse torepair it, so&#xD;
far as he can. You hear me, sir ?"&#xD;
Guy knew that he could not trifle wi'itli his&#xD;
uncle then, and that for him all was lost, uin-&#xD;
less lie obeyed the mandate instantly. There-&#xD;
fore, he advanced to the approaching party,&#xD;
an said ;&#xD;
Thavendanegea, I tried   to have your&#xD;
horse killed last nightI It was all my fault,&#xD;
not that of Ipisico. I am  sorry for it -will&#xD;
you forgive me&#xD;
The young brave stopped short, and looked&#xD;
at Guy with., quiet wonder-looked at him&#xD;
keenly, as if he would read his motive for this&#xD;
most unnatural act on the part of Guy, so&#xD;
unlike his general character, but made no&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"Forgive him, Thayendanegea, for my sake,&#xD;
even as I forgive him for having my poor&#xD;
pony killed !" said Kathleen, and tears started&#xD;
from her blue eyes.&#xD;
"I forgive you, for the sake of the Pale&#xD;
Rose !" said Thayendanegea, with gentle dig.&#xD;
nity. " And if you will be a man iow, I will&#xD;

dignity of the young brave, both in his ac-&#xD;
tions and his words.&#xD;
 God's life, hut the lad is fit for a throne I"&#xD;
he sai  to himself.&#xD;
Th p:rty passed into the house now, for&#xD;
the' eakfast-hell wis ringing. There were&#xD;
tears .n the eyes of both Leonore and Kath-&#xD;
leen, izs they passed along. And they were&#xD;
not tisrs of grief.&#xD;
CIIAPTEL XVII.&#xD;
Moo-lil, with the fire of anger anl of hate&#xD;
bnrnii d(eep into his heart, Guy Johnson&#xD;
waled fitr away into the beautiful grove&#xD;
bank of the mnaision, on the morning when he.&#xD;
made his forced apology, for he had no appe-&#xD;
tite for breakfast, and left the table as soon&#xD;
as he'could do so, without attracting particu-&#xD;
lar attention.&#xD;
And when he had got beyond hearing of&#xD;
those in the house, bitter curses'rose from&#xD;
his lips, and his angry words were not only&#xD;
many, but loud. lie did not know that he&#xD;
was'closely followed--.followed by one whose&#xD;
hart ached, nob only for his troubles, but&#xD;
also to hear such terrible language from his&#xD;
lips. lie did not know hut that he was alone,&#xD;
until a Lrentle hand w;as laid upon his shoul-&#xD;
der, and a sweet voice said&#xD;
"Guy, lear Guy, do not talk so---you are&#xD;
surely ~raving, arid do not mean what you&#xD;
eay I&#xD;
"I do mean every word I utter, Leonore !"&#xD;
said lie. imputieutly. " What business have&#xD;
you to follow inc like a spy, and overhear&#xD;
what I say ?"&#xD;
Oh! Guy, dear Guy, why do you speak&#xD;
so to sac ? You will break niy heart" said&#xD;
the weeping girl.&#xD;
"Women's hearts are made of leather-&#xD;
there is no danger of their breaking !"&#xD;
ller sobs were the only reply to his unUwanly&#xD;
words.&#xD;
Everybody hates me and wrongs me !"&#xD;
he continued.&#xD;
"Oh, no, no ! I love you, and never wrong-&#xD;
ed you in thought, word, or deed !" she re-&#xD;
pli..&#xD;
"My uncle, because he has taken a liking&#xD;
to a heathen bear of an Indian, first robs me&#xD;

. "And ?/Ou, too, must take up for this graes&#xD;

"Guy, you do me, a foul wronr, and %lch&#xD;
words come with an ill, grace from your lip.&#xD;
to one who has stood by you so often when&#xD;
she knew you were wrong, and lms so often&#xD;
dared her father's anger to avert it from your&#xD;
head !"&#xD;
"Clear out, then, and leave me alone, i&#xD;
you don't like my words ! I didn't ask yoe&#xD;
to follow me !" said he, in the most brutal&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"Guy, dear Guy, even this will I bear, fot&#xD;
the love I feel for you !"' she cried, weepin,&#xD;
and attempting to put her arnis around his&#xD;
neck.&#xD;
With a bitter curse, he thrust her from&#xD;
him, with such force that she fell, and bes&#xD;
head coming in contact with the sharp edge&#xD;
of  a stone, received a terrible cut. The blood&#xD;
gushed out in a large stream, for a small ar-&#xD;
tery in the temple had been divided. But the&#xD;
poor girl was not sensible of paini-she had&#xD;
fainted.&#xD;
When he saw blood, the anger of the hear&#xD;
less wretch gave way to terror.&#xD;
"My God, I have'killed her !" lie groaned&#xD;
" What shall I do ! what shall I do t"&#xD;
"Go 'get water !" said a stern voice, and&#xD;
the same white-haired, venerable, and feeble-&#xD;
looking Indian, whom we have once before&#xD;
spokeni of, as being seen in that same grove,&#xD;
stepped forward from amid a clump of small&#xD;
spruce trees, to the astonishment and increased&#xD;
terror of the young villain.&#xD;
What shall I bring it in ?" asked the ter&#xD;
rifled youth.&#xD;
* "That," and the Indian touched the glazed&#xD;
cap on Guy's head.&#xD;
The latter hurried away to a brook, whose&#xD;
.distant murmurings could reach the ear,&#xD;
while the old Indian bent upon his knees, and&#xD;
raised the head of the poor girl. Her couna-&#xD;
tenance was as white as the leaf of a litv, and&#xD;
life seemed almost to have deserted le?.&#xD;
With a firm hand lie held the parts of the&#xD;
wound closely together, then taking a scarf&#xD;
from her neck, bound it so tightly around her&#xD;
temples that he checked the flow of blood.&#xD;
And when the water came, he washed away&#xD;
the blood-stains, bathed her face, and wette&#xD;
her lips with some of it.&#xD;
With a deep sigh, she opened her eye,&#xD;
and exhibited signs of returning conscione-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
"Where am J?   Oh, I remember !" she said;&#xD;
with a shudder. "Guy was angry, and struck&#xD;
me !" and she closed her eyes again, as if to&#xD;
shut out the vision of cruel remembrance.&#xD;
" Who are you, sir, that are so kind to&#xD;

the Indian. in a tone and-with a look which&#xD;
would imply that he was seriously thinking of&#xD;
the proposition.&#xD;
" Yes," answered Guy.&#xD;
And you love his daughter, the lily which&#xD;
you bruised this morning ?"&#xD;
"Yes, and when he is dead'I will marry&#xD;
her-"&#xD;
"lie brought you up since you was a little&#xD;
helpless boy, without father and mother, did&#xD;
he not.?"&#xD;
"Yes; but Low do you know that? Have&#xD;
you ever seen me before this day ?"&#xD;
Yes. yes, a hundred times, when you was&#xD;
too snill to crawl over a log."&#xD;
Well, well, it matters not. What is your&#xD;
answer to 'm proposition ?"&#xD;
'hat I thank the Great Spirit I am not a&#xD;
pale-thee! Do your own murders!    I am&#xD;
not an assassin !" said the old Indian, and,&#xD;
turning proudly upon his heel, he disappeared&#xD;
in the thick gloom of the grove, before the&#xD;
youth had recovered from the surprise into&#xD;
which the indignant and bitter tone of the&#xD;
scornful Indian had thrown him.&#xD;
"By heavens, what a fool I am !" he mutter-&#xD;
ed, when he found himself alone. "I should&#xD;
have killed the old wretch, for he possesses&#xD;
my secret, thought and intent, and if he should&#xD;
make it known to my uncle, my every hope&#xD;
would be blasted. I will never venture out&#xD;
without my gun again, and, if I see him, I&#xD;
will shoot him as I would a wolf!"&#xD;
"Shoot him, and I will shoot you?" said&#xD;
Thayendanegen, quietly, but firmly, as he&#xD;
stepped lout from behind the trunk of a huge&#xD;
pine tree within a few feet of him.&#xD;
"Why? Do you know him?" cried Guy,&#xD;
turning pale, and trembling from head to&#xD;
fuot.&#xD;
"No !" answered the young brave. "But&#xD;
he is an old man and an Indian-lie is good,&#xD;
for he would not do a murder at your bidding!&#xD;
You could not hire him, as you did Ipisico, to&#xD;
do your wicked-work ! You are less than a&#xD;
dog-that would never bite the hand which&#xD;
fed it !"&#xD;
"Why should you act the spy upon me?"&#xD;
" Because your heart is blacker than mud !&#xD;
Yot are bad-too bad to live! I will watch&#xD;
every step you take, and, if you raise your&#xD;
hand or evil eve to one thing which I love,&#xD;
or is helpless,I will kill you as I would a&#xD;
snake !"&#xD;
"I suppose you will go and tell my uncle&#xD;
of this titter !"&#xD;
"I am no tale--bearer !" proudly relied the&#xD;
young Indian. "I can watch over him with-&#xD;
out putting more fear or hatred in his heart.&#xD;
But you must not cross my path, or study evil'&#xD;
to him or his, or I will kill you ! I have&#xD;
spoken, and I cannot speak a lie !"&#xD;
Thavendanegea said no more, but, with a&#xD;
'itter look of contempt and scorn, turned upon&#xD;
&#xD;
his heel and went toward the mansion, leaving&#xD;
the baffled nephew of the baronet in no env-&#xD;
able state of mind.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
It was the custom with Dr. Daly, Mi.&#xD;
O'Whackem, and Mr. Lafferty, the 'baronet's&#xD;
secretary, to meet at twelve o'clock eaeh day,&#xD;
or immediately after the schoolmaster had dis-&#xD;
missed his pupils to their dianeri, to partake&#xD;
of a lunch and its spiritual accompaninente,&#xD;
in a pleasant little refreetory adjoining the&#xD;
htoslital, for these gentlemen all dined at tiq&#xD;
haronet's talde at a later hour. And it was&#xD;
the occasion, generally, for a lively bit of goa.&#xD;
silp, for, all three being Irishmen, they could&#xD;
no more get along without talking, than a co-&#xD;
quette without a string of beaux. Thus they&#xD;
kept the ir spirits up, while the spirits and the&#xD;
jokes went dovn.&#xD;
"IIow does your new patient look this&#xD;
morning, doctor dear ?" asked O'Whackem of&#xD;
Daly, as he poured out his glass of brandy, at&#xD;
lunch time.&#xD;
"Very much as if a horse had kicked himr,"&#xD;
replied the doctor, with a smile, as he e.&#xD;
tended his hi'id for the bottle.&#xD;
"he'll be apt to prefer sour healing power&#xD;
to the heeling way of the ould stallion, Pm&#xD;
after tlhinkini," said Lafferty, reaching in turd&#xD;
for the brandy.&#xD;
"lie's divifish impatient for a. patient," said&#xD;
Daly, as he helped himself to a slice of cold&#xD;
tongue and a cold potato.&#xD;
"He'll know better than to be so horse-styk&#xD;
again !" said Lafferty.&#xD;
"Och, ye blackguard, ye ought to be'co -&#xD;
victed, without judge or jury, of murder"&#xD;
cried O'Whackem.&#xD;
"Murder o' what, ye old pedagogue ?" r.&#xD;
1)lied Lafferty, in the best humor pi)ssibile.&#xD;
"The king's Endish, Misther Quilldivper,"&#xD;
said the schoolmaster, as he sliced off a bite!&#xD;
boiled ham.&#xD;
"It's a pity that Master Guy hadn't got a&#xD;
touch of punishment from the ktste," said&#xD;
Lafferty.                           .&#xD;
"Sure lie got a good enough tasting from&#xD;
me, I'm a thinking !" said Daly, with a laugh.&#xD;
"Why, his wasn't so much of an error, after&#xD;
all," said O'Whackem.    "lie might have&#xD;
been thinkin' of the neglected harp of $p.or&#xD;
ould Erin, when he called you 'a blasted 19y'&#xD;
-d'ye mind the point, now ?"&#xD;
"Sure the tune lie harped on was a ftmrlg4&#xD;
den one, as far as I'm concerned," said Daly.&#xD;
"Pass over the hgrad, Lafferty, if yv're dot&#xD;
too busy upon the hind shoulder o' that hn."&#xD;
" D'ye know wlhat you put me in min of&#xD;
then,doctor?"asked Lafferty.&#xD;
"No, sure-with,,ut it was that I eonsidexed3&#xD;

" Wall, 'tis lucky I did, for it's seldom ye&#xD;
tink of anything godly ; but, for the life o'&#xD;
we, I c'n't see how I reminded ye o' what I&#xD;

"Di}dn't you ask for daily bread, ould thick-&#xD;

"A nd why should I do that ?"&#xD;
"Doesn't the good book say 'hoe all ye who&#xD;

"Faith, you have me again ! I wish ye'd&#xD;

"For why, ould pill-box?   So ye could&#xD;

#'No; I only want to see ye shook up a&#xD;

And wakening the spirit ! Sure it's not&#xD;

"his advice is better than his medicine,&#xD;
E'm thinking' !" said O'Whackem.&#xD;
"Wait till you try 'em both, before you&#xD;
pass judgment," saidt the doctor.&#xD;
SI'd rather see the sexton and gravestone-&#xD;
uetter first, so as to make all my preparations&#xD;
lra decent burial!"&#xD;
"Let me write your epitaph I" cried Laf-&#xD;
&amp;amp;rty.&#xD;
'What would it be, Misther Goosequill ?"&#xD;
ked the schoolmaster.&#xD;
"The tike o' this," said Lafferty:&#xD;
"kHere lies ond sc'hoolmster O'Whackern:&#xD;
A hard nut is he. but Satan wil crack him."&#xD;
" Faith, he'd throw you down as unsound&#xD;
a ' not worth the eraekin' I" said the school-&#xD;
aaater, with a laugh.&#xD;
Thus these three worthies spiced their lunch,&#xD;
but it was soon over, and they returned to&#xD;
their different avocations, quite refreshed in&#xD;
body and mind.&#xD;
CH APTER XX.&#xD;
On the morning succeeding the night when&#xD;
ice came so near getting his well-merited&#xD;
sw, of having the life kicked out of hint&#xD;
ur William sent a runner to Aroghyndecka, to&#xD;
seuaint'bim that his son had beeti injured&#xD;
-             and was in serious danger. Though the run&#xD;
cr, after delivering his message, started in&#xD;
s*antly upon his return, and was well kntowi&#xD;
t. be one of the swiftest-of his class, the oh&#xD;
s ief quickly outstripped him, and lngere hi&#xD;
" - -         bd even sighted the chimney-tops of "John&#xD;
si Hall," had passe its threshold, and stood&#xD;
before the baronet&#xD;
&#xD;
"Where is my son?-wliere is Jpisico?-&#xD;
and who has dared to hrt him ?" ae.d the&#xD;
old Mohawk, with trembling frame and flash.&#xD;
iag eyes.&#xD;
"Sit down and calm yourself, and I will teU&#xD;
you," replied the baronet. "Ie has put his&#xD;
fingers in the time, anr: burned himself!"&#xD;
The chief, who knew    the baronet well&#xD;
enough to be sure he would gain nothiting by&#xD;
disobeying him, took the sent.&#xD;
Pontiocht, here ! Bring brandy and glasses&#xD;
for two-pi pes, also!" cried the baronet to his&#xD;
favorite servant.&#xD;
The old chief sat very uneasily-for a won-&#xD;
der, even the anticipation of brand and to-&#xD;
bacco did ant quiet his feelings.&#xD;
It soon came ; and, after each had drank a&#xD;
glass, the baronet lighted his pipe and coin'&#xD;
meneed smoking, quietly and in silence. For&#xD;
a time, the Indian preserved his stoicim, but&#xD;
finally the feelings of the parent triumphed&#xD;
over the philosophy-if such it can be termed&#xD;
--of the Indinn, and le abruptly asked&#xD;
Where is Ipisie I"&#xD;
In the hospital," replied  Sir William,&#xD;
without deigning to give any further explana-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
The Tndaian rose, did not pause to touch his&#xD;
glass, which the baronet had refilled, but&#xD;
walked from the oom , without uttering a&#xD;
word, and took his way hastily to the hos-&#xD;
pital.&#xD;
I.esoon after came back, and his face was&#xD;
dark, very dark, with either gloom or linger.&#xD;
Ile sat down, and, for a time, reinainc(d silent.&#xD;
lIe did not touch his brandy, and he had let&#xD;
the fire in his pipe go out.&#xD;
Sir William n remained as passive as before,&#xD;
drinking and smoking with mll the ease imag-&#xD;
inable, apparently not noticing the looks of&#xD;
the old chief, yet from under his over-&#xD;
hanging brows casting many a quick and&#xD;
searching glance at him. No Indian coukl&#xD;
ever beat him, either in the study of the&#xD;
thoughts or another, or in concealing his&#xD;
owni. For years an official visitor at their&#xD;
councils-of'ten the sole arbiter of their af.&#xD;
fairs, the medium  through whom they re-&#xD;
ceived alh their presents from the English&#xD;
government-he 11nd so become used to them&#xD;
that neither their arts, nor any personal dan-&#xD;
ger to himself, could throw him of' his guard,&#xD;
a or roh him of his self-possession.&#xD;
" Whimt or who hurt my son so terribly?&#xD;
He never vill be a muan again !" at last said&#xD;
the old chief.&#xD;
,    "LIe never ought to be !" said Sir William,&#xD;
- sternly. "If ie had been a man, he would&#xD;
- not have been hurt !" and lie then detailed&#xD;
the attempt of Ipisico to kill the horses, find&#xD;
d its result.&#xD;
e    The old chief listened in silence, until the&#xD;
baronet was through. Then lie said&#xD;
d    "M  sosn ws a fool!. I miam sorry Le was&#xD;
not killed'! 1 will see him no more! When&#xD;

&#xD;
he can walk, send him away from you, but&#xD;
not to me, for he shall never enter my&#xD;
lodge !"&#xD;
"No--I will be kind to him, and try to&#xD;
make a good man of him !" said the baronet.&#xD;
The oil chief made no reply, but drank&#xD;
his brandy, relighted his pipe, and went&#xD;
away.&#xD;
ChIAPTER XX!.&#xD;
When old Aroghyadeeka left the mansionI&#xD;
of Sir William, as recorded in our last chap-&#xD;
ter, he moved quietly on, apparently en-&#xD;
grossed in thought, for some distance, a half&#xD;
mile or Inure, until he entered the forest,&#xD;
which lay westward of the house. Here he&#xD;
moved on more rapidly, following a trail,&#xD;
narrow an1 straight, as Indian paths gener-&#xD;
ally are, which led toward his village. He&#xD;
had not proceeded fir along this road, when&#xD;
he was met by an individual, so singular in&#xD;
looks, dress, and character, that he merits a&#xD;
particular description at our hands, the more&#xD;
especially because this is our first introduc-&#xD;
tion to him.&#xD;
He was rather tall, lean, and bony in figure,&#xD;
but his broad shoulders, long arms, and bowed&#xD;
legs indicated considerabel sinewy strength.&#xD;
His form was so bent forward, that, coupled&#xD;
with a short neck, it seemed to give him a&#xD;
kind of humpbacked appearance. his head,&#xD;
as large, more red, and full as round as a&#xD;
Kinderhook cabbage, was surmounted by a&#xD;
mop of tangled yellow hair; his eyes were of&#xD;
a glassy gray, generally dull and heavy, yet&#xD;
bright and flashing, when he was excited.&#xD;
His nose was very small, and sunken in be-&#xD;
tween his large, pufty cheeks, like a small&#xD;
squash between two big pumpkins.     His&#xD;
wide mouth, ever open, revealed a snaggy set&#xD;
of teeth, well colored with tobacco juice.&#xD;
It would be hard to judge of his age--he&#xD;
had suoh a dried up-look-but he probably&#xD;
was thirty, perhaps five years ahead of it.&#xD;
His dress was as odd as his personal ap-&#xD;
pearance. A very ragged,,old felt lint, minus&#xD;
the rim, was on 'top of his head, and in its&#xD;
erown the tail of a racoon served for a plume.&#xD;
A coarse frock, or hunting shirt, descending&#xD;
to his knees, and girded to his waist by a&#xD;
stout rop) , made of twisted thongs of huck-&#xD;
skin, and as ragged as it well could be and yet&#xD;
stick together, served to partially coyer the&#xD;
upper part of his person. Through the rents&#xD;
of this a butternut-colored flannel undershirt&#xD;
could be seen. Trowsers, or rather leggins,&#xD;
of undressed deer-skin, and moccasins of&#xD;
moose-hide, completed his dress.&#xD;
A powler-hrn and bullet pouch were slung&#xD;
over his shoulder, and in his belt lie wore a&#xD;
knife and hatchet. A long pipe, of red clay,&#xD;
such as were used by the Dutch of that day,&#xD;
was also in ri belt. Upon his shoulder lie&#xD;
carried ov et those heavy, long; bell-muzzled&#xD;
&#xD;
''a&#xD;
&#xD;
pieces, brass-mounted and flint-locked, which&#xD;
were known as the  Queen's Airm," carrying&#xD;
an ounce and a half ball, or a single handful&#xD;
of slugs, as the caprice of the loader dictated,&#xD;
and calculated to do damage at any distance&#xD;
under half a mile, if properly directed.&#xD;
With a kind 'of limping, staggering gait,&#xD;
and a lek-lustre look, whi b seemed rather&#xD;
that of an idot, than that of a man possessed&#xD;
of his full senses, this individual met the old&#xD;
Mohawk hiief in the trail.&#xD;
The latter started as he saw him, and looked&#xD;
annoyed, for it is well known that Indians of&#xD;
every nation hold idiots and insane persons in&#xD;
reverence and awe, and fear to either harm or&#xD;
displease them.&#xD;
It is Hlon Yost," muttered the old chief.&#xD;
"Why should lie cross my path so often t&#xD;
Three times 'I have seen him since the sun&#xD;
come up!"&#xD;
" Hallo, olt Devil-bug I vere you peen all&#xD;
the vines, eh? Been a gittin' trunk on uncle&#xD;
Sir Pill's prandy, eli ?" criedl the stranger, as&#xD;
he stopped, and brought the butt of his heavy&#xD;
gun down upon the hard ground, with a far&#xD;
that made its iron ramrod ring in the socket.&#xD;
"Why ter tuivel ton't you speak mit me, you&#xD;
tan red-skin fool !" lie added, in his strong&#xD;
Dutch accent, as the old chief paused, but did&#xD;
not at once reply.&#xD;
"My heart is heavy, and my tongue is slow&#xD;
for words !" replied the Indian. "Where is&#xD;
my brother going ?"&#xD;
"Goin' vere der tuyvel tells me to-vere&#xD;
there's vitehes and vizards, and prandy and&#xD;
primstone-dings vot I lives on !" cried Hon&#xD;
Yost. "Shall I tell you vere you're 'fraid to&#xD;
go, oldl Devil-bug?"&#xD;
"Aroghyadecka is not afraid to go any-&#xD;
where !" said the old chief, sternly. "_is&#xD;
heart knows no fear."&#xD;
"Dat's a tam lie, a tam lie !" cried Hon&#xD;
Yost. "You knows peter as to go to de cave&#xD;
in do rock, pelow der Little Falls, for fear&#xD;
you see de spook of'somebody starved to&#xD;
death !&#xD;
The Mohawk started and trembled, when&#xD;
he heard these words.&#xD;
"TThe Evil Spirit tells Aim everything&#xD;
muttered he, at last.&#xD;
"Yaw I What Hon Yost don't know, no-&#xD;
podaly knows, old Devil-bug S" said the man,&#xD;
with a wild laugh, and lie re-shouldered. his&#xD;
gun, and went on, while the old chief moved&#xD;
aside to let him pass.&#xD;
For several minutes the chief stood and&#xD;
watched the receding form of the German,&#xD;
and his looks, while he did this, betokened&#xD;
both fear and hatred. But lie said -nothing,&#xD;
and, when the 'rnn was hidden from his view&#xD;
by intervening bushes,'the chief resumed his&#xD;
course.&#xD;
I-n Yost had not yet reached the clearing&#xD;
of the Johnson domain, when a low whistle&#xD;
from a clump of bushes upo his right, caused&#xD;

"I'd be a fool if I believed your answer !"&#xD;
"Then you'd be wiser than you be now, for&#xD;
if you was a fool like me, you'd know what&#xD;

" Airy fool could have learned it that way !"&#xD;
said the baronet, with a laugh. "I expected&#xD;
you'd have a tale of mystery to unfold !"&#xD;
"Not apout dat, unole Sir Pill, but I knows&#xD;
more dan one mystery,und I knows enough&#xD;
to keep my mouth shut und my ears open !"&#xD;
"An excellent quality,, Hon Yost.- I wish&#xD;
that all my surroundings possessed it!t What&#xD;
do you think of Thayenudanegea ? I see that&#xD;
you regard him very intently. Let us hear,&#xD;
for they say a fool's opinion is worth some-&#xD;
thing, sometimes !"&#xD;
"lie has de eye of an eagle, de spring of a&#xD;

fox, und do heart of a man! He .will be a&#xD;
great chief when you are dead und like de&#xD;
fallen tree, rotting in de cold ground'!" said&#xD;
lion Yost, in a tone as serious ard earnest, and&#xD;
language and style as lofty, as if he had been&#xD;
an inspired prophet.&#xD;
"Very complimentary to him !" said the&#xD;
baronet, in a pleasant tone.&#xD;
"fDat's more dan de truth-is to everybody !"&#xD;
said lion Yost.&#xD;
"What wiUt I be, Roa ?" asked John, in a'&#xD;
careless way.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"Yust what der coot Cot blenses, und yoav.&#xD;

- Am i to bse a soldier,'a priest, or a farier 1'&#xD;

bray, und so you won't be a briest; you're&#xD;
too proud to work, so you won't be a farmer,&#xD;
naybe you'll be a soldier, und if you're too&#xD;
lazy to run, den you'll make a very coot one e'&#xD;
"You needn't call him' a fool, after that,&#xD;
Master John !" said the baronet, laughing.&#xD;
" It is my opinion that he is up to your ranrk,&#xD;
and you had better replenish his tobacco-box,&#xD;
and ask 'no more questions !"&#xD;
"fUnd den apout de rifle-gun, und der teers&#xD;
uind moose dat I shall shoot mit it, uncle Sir&#xD;
Pill?"&#xD;
Oh, you shall have them, Hon Yost  You&#xD;
are not much of a beggar, and are very goot&#xD;
pay when you can pay !"&#xD;
"Und a couple of plankets, uncle Sir Pill!"&#xD;
"Two blankets---Why is not one stleicient?"&#xD;

" Well, you shall have the two blankets,&#xD;
and a calico dress for her beside, but you must&#xD;
let me kiss the bride !"&#xD;
"Yaw ; but den I shall yustmcharge a pottle&#xD;
of praundy for de privilege !"&#xD;
The baronet did not reply, but led the way&#xD;
to his store-room, where he kept a vast variety&#xD;
of airs, munitions, and such cheap goods/as&#xD;
were needed by the class of Indinus, fron-&#xD;
tiersmrren, and settlers around himr. Here he&#xD;
fitted lion Yost out with the arms which lie&#xD;
had solicited, and the blankets and calico&#xD;
promised ; also giving him some snuff and&#xD;
tobacco for his mother, an old gipsy of a&#xD;
woman whom the baronet had long known.&#xD;
Antd amused as ie ever was by the drolleries&#xD;
of hor Yost, he plied him pretty well with&#xD;
liquor, and, when ie finally tired of him, sent&#xD;
him away with a bottle full, telling him to be&#xD;
sure and bring him some venison on the next&#xD;
day, which the German faithfully promised&#xD;
to do.&#xD;

to he between hun and the fire&#xD;

quietly smokig his pipe.&#xD;

"Dunder, put it makes me feel goot, to&#xD;

of calico vhich Sir William had given to&#xD;
him.              '&#xD;

I want no clothes but those I make from&#xD;

while he was still looking' at the calico, he&#xD;
said :" lon Yost was at the upper village,&#xD;
to-day, was lie not ?"&#xD;
" Yaw-two times have I peen dere&#xD;

"It my brother will hang this, in the night-&#xD;

lodge, I will each day kill him plenty of game,&#xD;
and I will make hinm  pretty dresses and&#xD;

quills, which he can sell for money !" said&#xD;
the indian&#xD;
"iDat's a pargain; but for vy do you care&#xD;

yours, gratdaad?"&#xD;
I will sometime tell you why I wish to&#xD;

know from whience these thiings come to her !&#xD;
Did you see the young 'I'hayendanegea;?"&#xD;

It is good! May the Great Spirit bless&#xD;
him !" sud the obl indian, and then, drawing&#xD;
his new blanket around him, he retired with-&#xD;
in the shanty, and laid down to sleep.&#xD;
IIin Yost smoked his pipe out, replenished&#xD;
the fuel on the fire, and then followed his ex-&#xD;
iuiple. .&#xD;
CIIAPTEI XXIV.&#xD;
The sun was not more than two or three&#xD;
hours high, on the next morning, when the&#xD;
barouet belie hilion Yost approalhiing, bend -&#xD;
iii iunlbr a heavy burthen. Upon his back&#xD;
he carried a huge saddle of venison, with the&#xD;
fit full two inCites thick upon the hesunich, and&#xD;
strung to his belt wtse a dozen or more of&#xD;
hue partridges, while a his left hand he car-&#xD;
&#xD;
ried a string of brtsk trout, and ur.- hie&#xD;
right to steady the game on lls shoulders, for&#xD;
lie had left his gun behind him.&#xD;
"Why, lion Yost; you are wonderfully&#xD;
prompting making your payieunts, this time "&#xD;
cried the baronet, as ire loMked'withi the adiir-&#xD;
ling eye of a sportsmau upon the splenid lot&#xD;
of game which the German laid down upon&#xD;
the poirch before him.&#xD;
"Yaw--maype I vants more trust, py-and-&#xD;
py-den, if I pay goot now, you trust inc&#xD;
more!" replied ion Yost.&#xD;
"A very good reason, with a spice of sel-&#xD;
fishness ; but how could you get together so&#xD;
much game in so short a tune ? It wts dark,&#xD;
or very nearly so iwhen you left here, lat&#xD;
night!"&#xD;
You know dat it is de olt saying, uncle&#xD;
Sir Pill, 'a fool for.luck, undja rich man for&#xD;
chiltren!'&#xD;
"'A fool for luck, and a poor man for chil-&#xD;
dren,' is the adage, lion Yost !"&#xD;
"Den it's half truth, und de odder half a&#xD;

"how so " asked the baronet.&#xD;
"For v, lIm a afool, und I.have de goot&#xD;

Thi baronet laughed at this huame-thrust,&#xD;
for it was a fact which he could not deiny, an I&#xD;
said:&#xD;
You deserve a drop of brandy for that,&#xD;
IIon Yost ! Conic and get it !&#xD;

"No one knows her better. But not even&#xD;

now, come to my camp ; but, first, we will.&#xD;
take the skin of the panther, and then you can&#xD;
wash away the blood from your form, and I&#xD;
will dress your scratches. It was a brave&#xD;
fight, and I am glad that you killed the beast&#xD;
without my help. But your aim was bad.&#xD;
You fired ytoo low. A panther's heart is&#xD;
small. You should have put your ball be-&#xD;

In a short time the hunter's proudest&#xD;
trophy, the skin of the tiger of the north, was&#xD;
taken off, and then Thayendanegea followed&#xD;
the old Indian to his camp.&#xD;
The eyes of Thayendandgea looked with&#xD;
surprise at the comfortable shanty, and he&#xD;
asked : "how long have you lived here ?"&#xD;
"More than twelve moons !" replied the'old&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"And have not been to the Hall, which is&#xD;
only three or four miles away ?"&#xD;
"No ; I am known there,"but do not wish&#xD;
to go there until the time set by the Great&#xD;
Spirit. I have watched over you and Ona-&#xD;
lova and Dyagetto, your mother, when you&#xD;
all were sleeping! hear these words, but&#xD;
repeat them not There is a cloud over you&#xD;
now, b)ut the Great Spirit will blow it away !"&#xD;
" Thayendanegea believes your words !&#xD;
And he will obey !" said the young Indian,&#xD;
thoughtfully and with respect.&#xD;
Tlien, as his eye fell upon the work upon&#xD;
which the old Indian had been engaged, lie&#xD;
said :&#xD;
" You must know lion Yost, for he brings&#xD;
such things as those to the hall to sell&#xD;
"Yes; lion Yost is a good man, and is&#xD;
here very often!"&#xD;
"Talk of der duyvel, and he is pound sure&#xD;

man friend, who, hearing voices at the camp,&#xD;
had approached noiselessly.  "Vy, here is&#xD;

dirt--dunder--did you kill dat painter peast?"&#xD;
"Ile killed it alone, singlehanded, with his&#xD;
knife, after he had wounded it with his rifle !"&#xD;
said the old Indian, and his keen black-eyes&#xD;
washed with pride and satisfaction, as he gazed&#xD;
after the young man, who proceeded to the&#xD;
brook to wa-h away the stains of his battle,&#xD;
while lion Yost stretched out and examined&#xD;
the huge skin of the panther.&#xD;
Dunder, vot a pig painte'!" exclaimed the&#xD;
German. "1 tell you vot, grandad, dat poy&#xD;

"Yes ; lie will be a great chief!" replied&#xD;
the ohl Indian. "I shall see that, and then I&#xD;

hunting-grounds above, in peace !"&#xD;

him accept of a new suit of elegantly-worked&#xD;
hunting clothes, bidding him say at the Hall&#xD;
that they were a present from lion Yost,&#xD;
whom ie had met in the forest,&#xD;
"May I come to see you again ?" asked the&#xD;
young ndian, after he had exchanged his old&#xD;
clothes for the new.&#xD;
"Yes, if you come alone! And keep my&#xD;
words ; for no one beside you and IIon Yost&#xD;
must know that I am here ! Come, and I will&#xD;
tell you of the deeds of your fathers-tell you&#xD;
of the brave works of your race, and show&#xD;
you how to tread the path before you !"&#xD;
"I will come !" said the young Indian, and&#xD;
he took up the panther-skin and his rifle, and&#xD;
went away.&#xD;
CIIAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
Another wild, wide bound over the desert&#xD;
of Time, with its wrecks and sleepy years,&#xD;
lay behind us ; for in them there is nothing&#xD;
that claims more than a passing glance at our&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
And what a change those years have&#xD;
wrought among our characters! In, stature,&#xD;
as in age, Thayendanegea has become roan--&#xD;
in deed and fame, a warrior. lhe beard has&#xD;
stolen out upon the face of John Johnson, and&#xD;
the careless laugh of the boy has given place&#xD;
to the stern demeanor of the man.    Guy&#xD;
Johnson, still mean. envious, full of treachery&#xD;
and guile, progresses with the rest along&#xD;
Time's pathway. lHe yet remains beneath the&#xD;
roof of Sir William, whose white hairs, nore&#xD;
than any bodily infirmity, tell, too, that heis&#xD;
growing older.  And Mr. O'Whaekem    still&#xD;
lives, the birchifying terror of the rising&#xD;
generation, and the "oracle" of the' neigh-&#xD;
borhood The ltdies-I mean the young&#xD;
ones-have "spread'" considerably, not ihoopa-&#xD;
tively; but a truce to all of this re-descriptive-&#xD;
ness. Imagine every one of my characters&#xD;
five or six years ahead of where we left them&#xD;
in the chapters preceding this, andi so far as&#xD;
human progression goes you have them ready&#xD;
for the parts they have to play in the continua-&#xD;
tion of the tale.&#xD;
It was spring, leafy, balmy June, in 1774.&#xD;
And those who now dwell in the valley of the&#xD;
Mohawk can tell you how bright and beauti-&#xD;
ful, how very pleasant is that month there&#xD;
after the long, cold winter has passed utterly&#xD;
away, and the late spring frosts peculiar to&#xD;
the region have vanished, and the young,&#xD;
green leaves and the bright flowers have&#xD;
come to life--to life and beauty.&#xD;
It was a night for love, for the stars were&#xD;
looking from a cloudless sky, and the new&#xD;
moon showed its silvery crescent among&#xD;
them.&#xD;
And there was love-making, or wooing,&#xD;
going on at that time in the vicinity of&#xD;

S\Where is your heart, Thinendanegea ?"&#xD;
asked  Kathleen, as they   walked through&#xD;
the grove.&#xD;
"troing within my breast, like the heart&#xD;
of the oak !'' wais his reply.&#xD;
" Arid will love never enter it?" she asked.&#xD;
"Love is for women to talk about !" was&#xD;
his answer. " A warrior, whose eye is upon&#xD;
the war-path, hafs oilier things to think of."&#xD;
" But there is no war now ! Why should&#xD;
you ie forever thinking of that?"&#xD;
"Because it will come, and soon.  Your&#xD;
father says so, and truth is on his lips, lie&#xD;
never spoke to me with a forked tongue !"&#xD;
" Well, it will come, and soon pass awny,&#xD;
like the dreadful storm so long ago, which&#xD;
neser can forget; for there you saved my life.&#xD;
But I would rather see no wear; for if it comes,&#xD;
then you may fall, as Iwell as others whio are&#xD;
dear to mne-myc father an mily brother!1"&#xD;
"Your father will not tread the war-path.&#xD;
&#xD;
ie is too old; but I will strike for him!  I&#xD;
I fall, it will be as a brave should fall, anda no&#xD;
one will weep for me&#xD;
"how wrong and how cruel to ay that!"&#xD;
Tears stole out fror her blue eyesrand down.&#xD;
her fair cheeks, as she added :  If I weep at&#xD;
the thought, how  much the   onre will I&#xD;
weep at the fact, should it ever occur. And&#xD;
Dvagetto, your giod mother, ai   Onalova.&#xD;
your sister, will grieve all as much, I ari&#xD;
sure!"&#xD;
"The mother and sister of a Mohawk will&#xD;
never weep for his death, in battle, if his face&#xD;
is turned toward the foe !" hereplied, as they&#xD;
passed from the grove toward the house,&#xD;
" Will Onalova be my bride !" said John&#xD;
Johnson to the Indian gir. as he passed his&#xD;
arm  around her waist, while they walked&#xD;
through the shadowy grove.&#xD;
Onalova has given her heart to you. She&#xD;
will never change while water iliws down the&#xD;
hill-side, or the trees grow !'' replied the girl.&#xD;
"Iiut while my fa lier lives he will refuse&#xD;
to let the heir to his title marry the daughter&#xD;
of the Mohawk."&#xD;
"TIe is a fool, then, for the child of the red&#xD;
man is as good as the sdn of the ale face. I&#xD;
it is not so, why do you say that you love&#xD;
me ?"&#xD;
"You are as good, my proud girl. lie vill&#xD;
look higher for me !"&#xD;
If he looks too high, he will not see the&#xD;
path that he walks upon, and fll !" said the&#xD;
girl, proudly.&#xD;
"That is true ; but Onalova can be my&#xD;
lbrile in secret, without his knowledge, and&#xD;
when lie lasss to the spirit-land, I can tell&#xD;
all the world lhat she is mine !"&#xD;
TThe girl looked at hu ket nly and hesitated&#xD;
to reply. He noticed this and said&#xD;
"if iOnalova's heart is mine she will not&#xD;
pause to answer&#xD;
"THer heart is yours, and she will not fear&#xD;
to trust you !" said the trusting girl, and,&#xD;
thouglg  colder in her nature, prhaps, na most&#xD;
of her race, than the pale-faces, sire did not&#xD;
turn from his kisses, nor fear to listen to his&#xD;
plain for their secret marriage.&#xD;
And at that very hour Guy Johnson had&#xD;
succeeded in gaining a reluctant consent from&#xD;
Leonore to take a similar step.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
Old Aroghryadecka paced to and fro, with a&#xD;
lowerig brow, in the sitting-room  of Sir&#xD;
Wilflan Johnson. Ihis fiery eve never had&#xD;
gleamed more fiercely on the battle-field than&#xD;
it did then and there, and every quivering&#xD;
muscle showed the agitat ion of his mind-&#xD;
that there was a tempest in his breast. But,&#xD;

TUE WAR-EAGLE (&#xD;
which he had 3ust, received from Boston, an-&#xD;
pouncing the nil-important fact that hostilities&#xD;
had actually broken out between the colonists&#xD;
and the English government ; that a revolu-&#xD;
tion. likely to be long and bloody, had com-&#xD;
inenced. As a titled officer of King George,&#xD;
from whom lie had received many a favor,&#xD;
besides the lucrative post which he held, of&#xD;
course there was but one side which he could&#xD;
be expected to take in the coming struggle.&#xD;
And having so large a body of tenantry under&#xD;
his control, mostly Scotch and Irish, whom he&#xD;
had himself imported and placed upon his&#xD;
domains, and also a sere control of all the&#xD;
Indians except Oneida's, between him  and&#xD;
Canada, in which province lie also had great&#xD;
influence, his services were at once called for,&#xD;
not only to crush rebellion, as it was termed,&#xD;
should it rise in the thickly-settled valley of&#xD;
the Mohawk, but also to organize and excite&#xD;
the Indians to take part in the merciless var-&#xD;
fare so soon to be commenced in that section,&#xD;
down the valley of the hudson, and in the&#xD;
region of the Delaware and Schoharie.&#xD;
And these were the instructions which ac-&#xD;
conipanied the dispatches, telling of patriot&#xD;
and British blood having been already shied&#xD;
at Boston, of the determination of the king&#xD;
and his servants to crush the rebellion at all&#xD;
hazards and at all costs. And old as he was,&#xD;
leternminel to take the field in person, for the&#xD;
safety of his immense possessions depended&#xD;
on his beating back the patriots, whom lie&#xD;
knew, led on by a Herkimer and a Willet,&#xD;
would not long be idle when the war-cry was&#xD;
raised in the valley.&#xD;
The cause of the anger of the old Mohawk&#xD;
chief ennr better be discovered by the words&#xD;
of their conversation, than in any other way.&#xD;
" Vhy must I, who have led my people to&#xD;
battle so often, be made to yield to that boy,&#xD;
whose flce is like that of a squaw?" he asked,&#xD;
at last.&#xD;
"For three reasons," replied Sir William.&#xD;
"First, it is his right, too long delayed. ;Next,&#xD;
he is a brave warrior, young as lie is, and&#xD;
though his rights are yet unknown to him or&#xD;
his tribe, no man so popular there as he.&#xD;
Lastly, it is my will! You are old-need rest&#xD;
rather than to travel on the war-path 1"&#xD;
"The great chief has counted as niany sum-&#xD;
mers as I have, and the snows of as many&#xD;
Winters are upon his hairs !" said the oho&#xD;
thief, not so angrily as whenlie asked his&#xD;
question, for, knowingas he did that the baro-&#xD;
miet. was iii no humor to be trified with, he&#xD;
deemed caution to be his best policy.&#xD;
"'True, but I have a son and a nephew,&#xD;
rep"d as soldiers, -to .lead ny:-warriors to&#xD;
battle, and Thayendanegea mst and shall&#xD;
kad the M11 ohawks-nae, and the Six Nations,&#xD;
if I witl it! None of the chiief of the Sene-&#xD;
ens,' or Uiontdagos, or Cayugasiwil offer, like&#xD;
)ou, to oppose-rmy will !"&#xD;
" The great chief has spoken, and Aroghya-&#xD;
&#xD;
)F THE MOUAW      S,             '     51&#xD;
decka will now be silet.t, Let the will of my&#xD;
brother be done," said the wily ehief, bat&#xD;
there was treachery in hije look as he&#xD;
spoke.  "I will call a -eouncil, and myself&#xD;
name Thayendanegea as my successor, for I&#xD;
anm old, and, like a rotten tree, scarce fit to be&#xD;
cut down, but ready to fall with the firs&#xD;
blast that comes. It is winter with me-I&#xD;
will fold my arms, and sit down in my wig-&#xD;
warn to die, while the young braves follow&#xD;
the path I first led them on !"&#xD;
The sad tone of the old Indian, more than&#xD;
aught else, led the old baronet to believe in&#xD;
his sincerity. And there was a tone of sym-&#xD;
pathy in his voice, and a look of pity in his&#xD;
face, as he said :&#xD;
"Let Aroghyadecka be cheerful--he retires&#xD;
to rest, and live in comfort now. lie shat)&#xD;
never lack for food or blankets while I or my&#xD;
children live.  And when his braves come&#xD;
back to dance the scalp-dance, his 'will be the&#xD;
seat of honor at the council-fire, for they will&#xD;
,remember his great deeds when he waa young,&#xD;
and we fought the French side by side, and&#xD;
will make his heart glad with their praises!"&#xD;
And then he went to get brandy himself, for&#xD;
he had reasons for wishing to have this inter-&#xD;
view uninterrupted, even by a servant, for he&#xD;
knew the vital importance of keeping the&#xD;
news utterly secret which he had received,&#xD;
Iad he seen the wily and devilish look&#xD;
of hatred which followed him from the eli&#xD;
Indian's eyes, he would have been more upon&#xD;
his guard, and had lie seen the old villain&#xD;
take from his pouch some of the deadly bee-&#xD;
ries of the ground-hemlock, and squeeze theris&#xD;
into the goblet of silver from which the old&#xD;
general always drank, his life would have been&#xD;
longer spared, and his death less shrouded in&#xD;
mystery than it was.     a&#xD;
Scarce had Aroghyadecka, with a skill&#xD;
which would have made him immortal in the&#xD;
days of Lucretia Borgia, paced the deadliest&#xD;
portion known to the aborigines of the Nortl&#xD;
in the goblet, when Sir William returned, and&#xD;
pouring out a glass of liquor for the Mohawk,&#xD;
also put a hearty draught in his own goblet,&#xD;
and raising it to his lips, said :&#xD;
"We will drink to King George and oii&#xD;
future friendship, Aroghyadecka, and then&#xD;

gan to feel the effects of the poison.&#xD;
"Dog! you have slain me" he gasped, a&#xD;
he strove to reach the door.&#xD;
"You first, Thayendanegea next !" said'the&#xD;
°old murderer, as be pushed the already tot.&#xD;

gasped for only a few moments, and then&#xD;
stiffened in death.&#xD;

TJIAYENDANEGEA, TiE SCOURGE; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WAR-EAGLE OF TILE MOHAWKS.&#xD;
&#xD;
A gleam of pleasure, rather than of pain,&#xD;
shot from the eyes of the hieart!ess nephew,,&#xD;
when he heard ius news, but le could not&#xD;
avoil alarming the family, and himself has-&#xD;
-tning to the baronet's room.&#xD;
All was now excitement .and mourning&#xD;
through the mansion, and all the settlement.&#xD;
'Weeping 'and wailing was seen and beard&#xD;
'               Iupon every hand, for, as a master and a&#xD;
friend, as a husband and a father, no one was&#xD;
*ver more loved than he.&#xD;
The physician, who had so long known&#xD;
every symptom of his ailings, and every fault&#xD;
of hise anstitution, decided that the baronet&#xD;
had d.ed of apoplexy, for lie knew nothing of'&#xD;
the nature of the poison which he had taken,&#xD;
sid the ap pearance of the deceased was such&#xD;
is left by an apoplectic fit. None, for a&#xD;
moment, thought how he had perished, for&#xD;
he had been in usual health until a few mo-&#xD;
ments of the time when lie perished.&#xD;
Johni, who at once became a baronet, as the&#xD;
ntly son ind nearest heir of his either, though&#xD;
-                 convulsed with grief-tfr lie was an affection-&#xD;
ate son, no matter what his other faults were-&#xD;
at once took possession of his papers, and his&#xD;
last diepatches, and secured them, for he saw&#xD;
their importance,&#xD;
AAmong the many who hurried to the room&#xD;
where the corpse laid, was our old friend, Hon&#xD;
Yost Sc/ yler.&#xD;
iHe had ever an idle way of peering about,&#xD;
and searching into things whieb dl not much&#xD;
concern him, aund upon this occasion he took&#xD;
ttp the goblet from which the poisoned draught&#xD;
-                had been swallowed, and smelled its contents,&#xD;
if any there were in it, perchance to see if&#xD;
there wagany of his favorite beverage, liquor,&#xD;
left in it.&#xD;
The moment that lie did so, lie started,&#xD;
tun"e pie, and set the goblet down.&#xD;
" Duiler and blixen, I wonder if der oit&#xD;
man is a pigger fool dan me, and has  iade&#xD;
himself avay mit a suicideP l' e muttered, in&#xD;
a low tone, unheard by those who were&#xD;
weeping around, and then he went and smell-&#xD;
ed of the other glass, which still contained&#xD;
some liquor, and this he did not set down&#xD;
with such haste and tremor as the other.&#xD;
And as now, Aroghyadecka was telling his&#xD;
tale, which was that the late baronet had sent&#xD;
a runner to him to bid him epme and see&#xD;
*.               him, that lie did so, and, while talking, Sir&#xD;
Wtlliam sudilenly fell back in his chair in a&#xD;
dying state-lon Yost listened to the story&#xD;
with a 1 atttention.&#xD;
A'ain he shook his head, as lie stood back&#xD;
betn the rest, and muttered to himiself&#xD;
,s" '  semeting tam pack in this matter.&#xD;
Okd Mohawk know all apout dat poison.&#xD;
-s                De baronet, uncle Sir Pill, didn't know it.&#xD;
Something plack, and if I don't find it out, den&#xD;
im a piggur fool dan sonei folks take me to&#xD;
Neither his words or actions were over-&#xD;
&#xD;
heard or noticed, for the company in th, room&#xD;
were too much engaged in looking upon the&#xD;
corpse, and hearing the narration of the only&#xD;
witness to the baronet's illness.&#xD;
/&#xD;
CIIAPTER   XXVIIT.&#xD;
It was a few hours later, and nght had&#xD;
spread its cloak of darkness over the earth.&#xD;
The Mohawk chief, lat f drunk with liquor,&#xD;
obtained from  Mr. O'Whackem   and others,&#xD;
wol) had wished to hear his tale of the bare.&#xD;
net's sudden iilliens and doith, was reeling&#xD;
along toward his village, when he suddenly&#xD;
came upon a camp by the side of the trail r&#xD;
path, and saw lion Yost sitting by the fire,&#xD;
smoking as usual, for it w as indeed unusual&#xD;
to see him without that appendage t here.&#xD;
"hallo, olt Tuyvethug, stop hero a minute&#xD;
or two !c ried Ilon Yost, as he saw Aroghy.&#xD;
adecka appronehing.  " I Want a word nuit&#xD;
you ! S'pose you take a trink m it mo now,&#xD;
like you did nmt Uncle Sir l'til to-daiy .!I&#xD;

Drunk as the old Indian was, tihe i a ting&#xD;
words of the Dutchman seemed to sober hin&#xD;
in an instant.&#xD;
" What does my pale-faced brother mean?"&#xD;
he said, first pausing a moment, and then ad-&#xD;
vancing slowly toward the fire.&#xD;
Yust vot I says-I toi't put cround-hem.&#xD;
lock in my pottle ven I tricks mit noiiieself !"&#xD;
said the Dutchman, and, as if to prove liii&#xD;
words, he raised a bottle to his lips and drank&#xD;
of its contents.&#xD;
"What does my brother' know of hem-&#xD;
lock ?' asked the \vilv Indian, approaching&#xD;
still closer to ion Yost.&#xD;
4 Dat it kills in less time dan  onu can cut&#xD;

more dan dat-to-day dere died mit hemlock&#xD;

"You'll never say so much to other earl&#xD;
dog of a pale-face e" cried the Indian, nd at&#xD;
a bound lie sprang upon11lon Yost with his&#xD;
hatchet raised for a death-blow.&#xD;
But the Dutchman was .-too much used&#xD;
to Indians and their ways to, be entirely&#xD;
unprepared for the assault, skkn as it wias,&#xD;
Stooping suddenly, albnost to the ground&#xD;
he evaded the blow of the hatchet, and catch-&#xD;
ing hini by thte egs, fairly toppled him ovrr,&#xD;
anal pitched him headlong into tihe fire. With&#xD;
a wild yell of race as well as ptin, the No-&#xD;
hawk sprung through the bbize, nud scai&#xD;
about to -renew struggle, whIjc he knitt&#xD;
would be of-death to one .or the other-_iuid&#xD;
he feared tth divulging of tie 'secret gaied&#xD;
byH a re'Y  more than he did death, for t&#xD;
shameful death he knew it voenidmrie&#xD;
him. Au Indian -would sooner' endue a$IUj&#xD;
&#xD;
totare than perish by the gallows--for it&#xD;
tes a belief with every tribe which I have&#xD;
known, that the spirit of an Indian who has&#xD;
been hanged, can never enter the happy hunt-&#xD;
in-.rounds above-their heaven-but must&#xD;
wander forevermore in a place of woe and&#xD;
darkness. And well it were if whites thought&#xD;
the same-they would be more careful how&#xD;
th  deserved hanging.&#xD;
uInt ILion Yost had reached his rifle before&#xD;
the Indian could make his second leap, and,&#xD;
with it cocked and full-levelled at the breast&#xD;
of the miaddened chief, he cried&#xD;
"If ever you pray, you, olt heathen tog,&#xD;
do it quick now, for a tead Isijun I'll make&#xD;
mit yomu ymst so sure as I live!I"&#xD;
A roshydecka hesitated  moment, but the&#xD;
fire of desperation was in his eye, and he &#xD;
would have bounded forward to- meet his&#xD;
death-for the aim of ion Yost never failed--&#xD;
but at this moment the white-haired and&#xD;
mysterious Indian, whom we have seen so&#xD;
few times, stepped from the dark gloom of&#xD;
the wood. 'within the circle of fire-light right&#xD;
between lion Yost and his- intended victim.&#xD;
Ugh! Ogahtee's spirit comes to curse&#xD;
me!" veied Aroghvadecka, wildly,and drop.&#xD;
ping his uplifted H~atehet, hie turned and feed&#xD;
madly awvuyinito the woods.&#xD;
" Cot il 'htirnunel, you spoiled the best shot&#xD;
I could have made dis ten years !" growled&#xD;
Ilon Yost, as lie lowered tis gun, sulkily.&#xD;
and took up his bottle from the ground,&#xD;
only to find tiat its contents hnd been lasted&#xD;
in the struggle, because the cork wvas omit&#xD;
" Dunder unl 'blixen, und    mv prandy-&#xD;

growled, a little mollified to find that at least&#xD;
one comfort was loft to him. "Vy for you&#xD;
not let tme shoot dat Tuyvelpug Injun ?" lie&#xD;
continued.&#xD;
"his time has not come, and it is not by&#xD;
your hand that he must die !" said Ogahtee,&#xD;
'quietly.&#xD;
" VA, den, de Tuyvelbug shall hang, for I&#xD;

"No; the Great Spirit has given him to&#xD;
me. For many a weary moon-niany a long&#xD;
year--I have suffered at his hands. For him&#xD;
my wife and chikren were sent far from me&#xD;
toward the sunset, and lie must fall by my&#xD;
hand. It was as well, too, that the iale-aticed&#xD;
chief died at his hands, for both were linked&#xD;
in the treachery which made my hairs white&#xD;
as winter's snow, while yet Iwas young and&#xD;
strong as the oak. For a squatv I was sold&#xD;
from sunlight to darkness-a warrior killed to&#xD;
make my tribe think I was slain, and those I&#xD;
loved senit fuir away !"&#xD;
"bovd Ucle Sir Pill did all die to you, Mr,&#xD;

&#xD;
" Yes ; I have spoken-and my tongue is&#xD;

"The time has come, my brother. I am&#xD;

"Dunder und blitzen, you vos tead so long&#xD;

down to rest !"&#xD;
" Dat is coot, put I must see der fun I"&#xD;

"It is well-go I I will be there before the&#xD;

Tetwo now parted, the one going toward&#xD;

village, both following the trail even in the&#xD;
darkness, with that certainty which only long&#xD;
practice in the forest can give to man.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
Within a lodge, which bore the signs ofthe&#xD;
smoke and the weather of many season ;sat&#xD;
Dyagetto, the noble mother of Thayenda-&#xD;
negea-sat there alone, working upon some&#xD;
of the choice and beautiful embroidery peon-&#xD;
liar to her nation-probably upon sote gaw-&#xD;
ment or ornament for her beloved chdldreA,&#xD;
for never mother loved children with deeper&#xD;
love than she. And why. one would ask, did&#xD;
She prefer thus jto dwell so far away from&#xD;
them in that hone lodge?&#xD;
For two reasons, and both compatible ith&#xD;
the natural, proud nobility, and the unciAng&#xD;
itig faithfuntess of her character.&#xD;
First, though'for'the sake of the care and&#xD;
advancement of her children, she was willing&#xD;
that tey should dwell beneath the roof of&#xD;
Jotinstn hatt, for herselfahie would acept no"&#xD;
favor at. the Inainds-of the lordly and wealthy&#xD;

THE WAR-E4GLE OF TIIE MOHAWKS.&#xD;
&#xD;
owner ; for she knew but too well what he har&#xD;
done to gain the loveliest maiden of the Mo&#xD;
hawk trite, whom lier fatter, Aroghtyadeeka&#xD;
would part with upon no terms, as she had&#xD;
been led to believe, but the death of her&#xD;
loved hiusbiand, and the perpetual banishment&#xD;
of herself and ebildren ; while he, bold ani&#xD;
wily villain that lie was, was, through Sii&#xD;
William's boundless influence, raised to the&#xD;
position of chief-of the Mohawks, which, by&#xD;
right of hterittige, as well as valor, belonged&#xD;
to the nolie-Ogahtee, her husband. Broken-&#xD;
hearted, and too proud to bear her shame, the&#xD;
bartered maiden-Aroghyadecka's daughter-&#xD;
died; and then the baronet felt keenly the&#xD;
price of his wrong to Ogahtee, supposing, as&#xD;
al diii, that the brave chief had fallen by the&#xD;
hand of an assassin-for a body, clad in his&#xD;
jrnents, but unrecognizably mutilated, had&#xD;
en found and buried as Ogahtee, with all&#xD;
se honors of his tribe, in their ancient burial&#xD;
und. But as we have seen, it was not he,&#xD;
but one who, belonging to another tribe, and&#xD;
having disappeared suddenly, was supposed&#xD;
to have been the assassin who had done the&#xD;
base deed, while, by the merciless cruelty of&#xD;
Aroghyadecka, Ogahtee was buried in the&#xD;
deep recesses of a cave, wherefrom no egress&#xD;
could be bad, save by help from  without,&#xD;
there to hear the taunts of his fiendish&#xD;
enemy, who only fed him that he might live&#xD;
and suffer.&#xD;
Thesecond reason why Dyagetto dwelt there&#xD;
alone was, that the lodge where first she had&#xD;
dwelt as a happy bride, was near Ogahtee's&#xD;
grave, or the grave where she thought he&#xD;
y, and to it she could make her daily pit-&#xD;
grinages, an'd upor out a sorrow which,&#xD;
with her, could know no end-a sorrow for&#xD;
the loss of her first and only love.&#xD;
Is there a heroism of love?   Ah! more&#xD;
0 aree than angels' visits now, is it ! These&#xD;
Cristian women, or many of them, who laugh&#xD;
or shudder at the terrible fidelity-for it should&#xD;
know no other name-which causes the Hin-&#xD;
o. widow voluntarily to mingle her ashes&#xD;
with those of her dead husband, upon his&#xD;
funeral pyre, rather than survive him-will&#xD;
themselves weep over the tomb of a husband&#xD;
for a few days, and then, forgetting all past&#xD;
love and sacred vows, seek and win and take&#xD;
another to their widowed breasts-east off&#xD;
their mourning weeds of mockery, and be&#xD;
smiling brides again. Is not this true?&#xD;
And how few do we see in this heartless,&#xD;
modern world. which I so much despise, who&#xD;
will, like Dyagetto, love and mourn their&#xD;
d through a long, dark life-time-how&#xD;
w.Z few?&#xD;
ain I asy that the heroism of love, in&#xD;
kart. which despise the heathen, is more&#xD;
Narce than honesty in Wall street, or patriot-&#xD;
ism in a politician-two things utterly un-&#xD;
known, ana out of data.&#xD;
But back, wild, wandering mind, back from&#xD;
&#xD;
d  the field of reflective truth to th' pathway of&#xD;
my story.&#xD;
Dyagetto sat there alone, a quiet. sorrow&#xD;
I resting upon her noble face, like a shadow&#xD;
r upon an unrufefld hake. But. a tootStepc near&#xD;
t her door aroused her from her pensive at',&#xD;
- 'tude, and she listened. as if fear of annova&#xD;
r was in her breast, and pushed back the .n.&#xD;
dian lamp of fish oil, which had s:it upon the&#xD;
table before her, and shadowed it with her&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
" Is it that accursed Aroghyadecka, who&#xD;
comes again to torment me, -s he threatened,&#xD;
. or the good Spirits of the Night, who so long&#xD;
have brought the widow food, though she&#xD;
was forbidden to look upon then ?" she said,&#xD;
She paused and listened, for the footsteps&#xD;
had ceased, and all was for a moment still.&#xD;
Then a voice, low and gentle, like one which&#xD;
she had heard in tones of love, longz years be.&#xD;
fore-and who can e'er forget that voice of&#xD;
lore ?-eame softly uponl her ear, from the&#xD;
front of the lodge.&#xD;
"Can Dyagetto make her heart brave, so&#xD;
that she catn look upon the Spirit of the Night,&#xD;
and feel no fear?"&#xD;
For a moment the woman trembled and&#xD;
paused, for brave, indeed, were she, who&#xD;
could be calm in such circumstances. Then&#xD;
gathering back her brave thoughts, site re.&#xD;
plied;,&#xD;
" Dyagetto will pray to the Great Spirik&#xD;
and then her heart will know no fear."&#xD;
And for a moment her heart looked up to&#xD;
God, and asked for strength ; and who will say&#xD;
that He would be deaf to such a "heathen s"&#xD;
prayer?&#xD;
Then she said calmly, and without fear&#xD;
" The heart of Dyagetto is clean, her eves&#xD;
are open, and she is not afraid to gaze upon&#xD;
the Spirit of the.Night !"&#xD;
" Even if it comes in the shape of the lost&#xD;
Ogahtee?" continued a voice.&#xD;
"More glad were Dyagetto to see the shape&#xD;
of her lost Ogahtee thatn to look upon tall&#xD;
the glories of the happy hunting-ground !"&#xD;
Softly the door opened, and the white.&#xD;
haired Indian-the fdlher of her children, the&#xD;
husband of her louth-stood before heer. his&#xD;
tall frame quivering with a life-emotion too&#xD;
powerful for other utterance.&#xD;
Oh, how piercing are the eyes of true love 1&#xD;
No bandaged Cupid let me see ! Love is&#xD;
not blind ! Though sorrow and suffering&#xD;
had bleached the hair she last had looked&#xD;
upon when jetty was its hue-though the&#xD;
once smooth brow was now furrowed by many&#xD;
a deep line of care and woe, and though the&#xD;
manly forr, was wasted by long suffering,&#xD;
her eye, like her heart, could not be deceived,&#xD;
and she bounded with a wild cry to his arms,&#xD;
even as a lost child would l-ap to meet t&#xD;
motlhr, and cried&#xD;
"it is Ogabtee's self! blest Spini of the&#xD;
Night I"&#xD;
&#xD;
And for a time no sound was heard, save&#xD;
the beating of two hearts, one against the&#xD;
other, and the heavy breathing from lips which&#xD;
could not speak.&#xD;
Then tears came from the heavenly portals&#xD;
of joy, then low words of gladness were heard,&#xD;
and a tale of suffering and woe, on either&#xD;
part, was told, so mingled with the happi-&#xD;
ness of the present that it hardly could seem&#xD;
sad, even like the shower that comes when&#xD;
the sun is shining.&#xD;
"have you seen our noble Thayendanegea?"&#xD;
asked Dyagetto, after the first explanations&#xD;
were over.&#xD;
"My eyes have watched over hirn for many&#xD;
moons, even as the eagle looks eldsely after&#xD;
its young t" replied Ogabtee.  "And," he&#xD;
added, "lhe is fit to rule the Mohawks now,&#xD;
and lead them on to battle, And to-morrow,&#xD;
when Aroghya-deeka goes down to darkness,&#xD;
black as his own heart, Thayendanegea shall&#xD;
stand before them as their chief. But to him&#xD;
we now must go, for he must know his father.&#xD;
The time has come."       /&#xD;
Bearing with her an embroidered belt and&#xD;
huntin-shirt, which she had made for him,&#xD;
Dyagetto hastened with her husband to meet&#xD;
aer son. All was yet night without; but there&#xD;
was no darkness within the hearts of those&#xD;
who went forth in it-all was light there.&#xD;
Not many minutes had the old lodge been&#xD;
 empty, before the stealthy steps of two persons&#xD;
approached, and soon the forms of two of our&#xD;
cliaracters made their appearance at the door,&#xD;
which in love's forgetfulness had been left&#xD;
open, as well as the light burning by Ogahtee&#xD;
and his wife, when they went out.&#xD;
First the hateful face of Aroghyadecka, none&#xD;
the more improved by the fiery ordeal through&#xD;
which ion Yost had so lately passed him,&#xD;
peered in through the open'door, and then&#xD;
over his slulder looked the scarred visige of&#xD;
his son Ipisico, of whom we have lost sight for&#xD;
a long time, but who had in some way regain-&#xD;
ed his father's favor, perebance for his very&#xD;
ugliness and natural deviltry.&#xD;
"She is not there ; she has heard our steps,&#xD;
and fled like the frightened doe from its nest,&#xD;
when it hears the hunter conic " said the old&#xD;
Indian.&#xD;
"If we hide, she will come back to her&#xD;
nest," said the son.&#xD;
"We cannot wait. We -must be ready for&#xD;
the council, to-morrow ; for soon our warriors&#xD;
must tread the war-path'!" replied Aroghva-&#xD;
decka and he turned away, followed by Ipisieo&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
"Well, we are here. Where is he who sent&#xD;
for me ?" said Thayendanegea, impatiently,&#xD;
jat at.the day's dawn, as he stood with lion&#xD;
ost before the lodge in the ravine, where&#xD;
Ogahtee had dwelt so long.&#xD;
&#xD;
"lIe said he vould he here mit de daylight.&#xD;
und he always speaks for true l' replied IHoa&#xD;
Yost.&#xD;
"Yes-my tongue is not forked-I am&#xD;
here !" said Oaahtee, as he stepped fromnthe&#xD;
lodge, with Dyagetto by his side, his aria&#xD;
upon her neck, and her's around his waist.&#xD;
And nobly now did he look, for he wore the&#xD;
rich garb of a chief, and a loftv look of joy and&#xD;
pride, such as Tlhavendanegea tad never seen&#xD;
him wear before, though often the young in.&#xD;
dan had sought him there to hear words of&#xD;
advising wisdom from his lips, little knowing&#xD;
'who it' was that spoke them.&#xD;
- The young Indian looked at both and their&#xD;
position with suspicious astoniisnment; but&#xD;
did not speak, for he knew not what to say or&#xD;
ask.&#xD;
"Does Thayendanegea remember-the land of&#xD;
the Minmis ?" asked Dyagetto.&#xD;
"lie has not forgotten the dogs that live to-&#xD;
ward the setting sun 1" repliedl Thayendane-&#xD;
gea.&#xD;
"And does he remember that there his&#xD;
mother promised that the time 'should come&#xD;
when he should know who his brave father&#xD;
was?"&#xD;
" Thayendanegea remembers that we came&#xD;
to seek his grave !"&#xD;
"That grave had not been filled I Behold&#xD;
Ogabtee, the true chief of the Mohawks, and&#xD;
yoeir fi/ther !" cried the proud mother&#xD;
"ANy mind is dark-make it more light,"&#xD;
said Thayendanegea, still with distrust,&#xD;
And then to him the tale of worider was&#xD;
told, so strange and yet so true, and be learn-&#xD;
ed for the first time who and what lie was, and&#xD;
why he: had been so much inclined to ever.&#xD;
ence the white-hAired man, whom now he&#xD;
knew as father. and embraced with the flial&#xD;
love of a son. Hard were it to describe the&#xD;
feelings of those so long separated, but now&#xD;
united, to part only when death should send&#xD;
his messenger unto them.&#xD;
It is only just to say, that Hon Yost danced&#xD;
a Dutch hornpipe for very glee, broke his&#xD;
"smoke-pipe," aid kicked over and shattered&#xD;
his beloved "prandy pottle." in honor of the&#xD;
occasion, and never grumbled at his'loss.&#xD;
Bt while this was going on as a "solo" upon&#xD;
his part, or rather as a "voluntary," Ogahitee&#xD;
and his spn were arranging their plan for pre-&#xD;
senting themselves -before the Council 'of the&#xD;
Mohawks, which they knew hail beenordered&#xD;
to assemble on that day.&#xD;
What those plans were, another chapter and&#xD;
their result must show.&#xD;

&#xD;
as republics, and first among the known na-&#xD;
tions in art and civiliation--of the wisdom of&#xD;
those old senators who listened to a Demos-&#xD;
-nben, and a Cicero, in grave silence, and&#xD;
dosght of what they heard, than the sight of&#xD;
an Indian council in full assemblage, upon an&#xD;
" -        irnplortaRntoccasion.&#xD;
i I have een present at more than- one, and&#xD;
as I saw them seated around their coneil fire,&#xD;
the oldest w rriors and the chiefs within, and&#xD;
the younger braves without the circle, first in&#xD;
solemn silence passing around the pipe which&#xD;
als mst. whiff, and then in a quiet, still as the&#xD;
_k         tomb, listing to each warrior who rose in&#xD;
turn to speak, I have contrasted the scene&#xD;
with the noisy debates, the lack of dignity,&#xD;
Lid respect each for the other exhibited by&#xD;
: ,our senators and representatives, whiel "I&#xD;
have witnessed m our national councils at&#xD;
Washington, and felt, that the savages were&#xD;
by tar the most respectable in their demeanor&#xD;
The Mohawks were in eonnci   their fire&#xD;
lighted in the huge wigwam devoted to that&#xD;
purpose ; the sentinels posted like tylers with-&#xD;
out, to keep back any curious listener or&#xD;
eavesdropper who might approach the sacred&#xD;
building ;for no Christian holds his church&#xD;
more sacred--nay, apparently not half soinuch&#xD;
so-ina the red men do their council house;.&#xD;
The pipe of friendship had passed from lip&#xD;
to lip, aol all was still but the slight crack-&#xD;
lhng of the tire that formed the centre of the&#xD;
circle.&#xD;
Aroghyadeeka arose, his crimes as yet all&#xD;
unknown to his tribe, and while he held a&#xD;
black belt in his hand, he spoke&#xD;
SBrothers: it is already known to you. that&#xD;
the great ehief of the pale-faces--our father,&#xD;
fir William J4hnson-has gone up to the land&#xD;
of spirits. Ilis children are crying. And we&#xD;
weep with them   Their hearts are under a&#xD;
eloud--its shadow also rests upon us. But an-&#xD;
other chief will fill his plnce as our friend, from&#xD;
the Great Father, King George, beyond the&#xD;
big salt waters !"&#xD;
e Is paused a moment, and taking a red&#xD;
.belt from his nearest attendant, Ipisico, con-&#xD;
tinned :&#xD;
"Yet while our hearts are sorrowful for the&#xD;
loss of our great friend, I have news to tell&#xD;
that will make you glid. Before he passed&#xD;
away, lie bade me cal ltlsis council, and to tell&#xD;
you that lie wished you to sharpen your&#xD;
knives and hatchets, and to be ready to tread&#xD;
the war-path.   The men of Boston have&#xD;
Sbrkse. faith with their Great Father, and&#xD;
many more pale-faces through the land mean&#xD;
to do the same. Our Great Father has dug&#xD;
up the hatchet to punish them. He calls upon&#xD;
his red children, the Mohawks, to help him do&#xD;
tids work. lie will give us many guns, much&#xD;
powder and land, and fire-water, and feed our&#xD;
wives nud children, while we are far away&#xD;
- a his war-path. I told our friend and&#xD;
father that for myse  I was a friend to Iiug&#xD;
'  ,        George. I wo      gup the hathet, paint&#xD;
&#xD;
my face. and fight for hin  1'om you ;t is&#xD;
to say-wilt you go where Aroglhvidieka&#xD;
leads ?"&#xD;
A murmur of approval followed ; then all&#xD;
was still, and Thayendnegea, the most popu-&#xD;
lar of all the younger braves, arose and said&#xD;
Brothers and fathers ! I have not lived&#xD;
so manry winters as inay of you, but I know&#xD;
that your ears will be open to my words, and&#xD;
I will speak. Brothers ! I am glad that the&#xD;
hatchet is to be dug np and that we are again&#xD;
to walk View ar-path, for I am tired of doing&#xD;
'notlhing.n My heart is hungry for action.&#xD;
But I ni;.st tell you a story brought to me by&#xD;
a bird. It is about a brave chief who loved&#xD;
his people and was beloved by thema-for he&#xD;
was first upon the war-path, and his wigwam&#xD;
was ever open to the hungry and the naked.&#xD;
But there was a snake in his tribe. And he&#xD;
wound himself around the neck of the brave&#xD;
chief, and dragged himt away to a cave, and&#xD;
hid him, and his people mourned for him as&#xD;
dead I And the snake, who worked in the&#xD;
dark, and was more cunning than the fox,&#xD;
came out among the people, and made him-&#xD;
self great.&#xD;
"Brother, I am ready to tread with you the&#xD;
war-path, but first behold the snake, and look&#xD;
upon mry father, Ogahtee, your rightful and&#xD;
long-lost chief!"&#xD;
And as the young brave uttered these&#xD;
words, he pointed with1 one hand at'Aroghya'&#xD;
decka, and with the other at his father, who,&#xD;
at that moment, walked into the council-house,&#xD;
clad in the most regal of savage garbs.&#xD;
In an instant Aroghyaleeka sprung to his&#xD;
feet with a look of defiance on his face, but&#xD;
when his eye met that of Ogabtee, he sunk&#xD;
down to the ground again, and, while he utter-&#xD;
ed amlow groan, he drew hris blanket over liii&#xD;
head,* for he knew that he was in !-tIe In.&#xD;
dians had recognised their chief.&#xD;
And then and there was seen that stoie and&#xD;
sage-like gravity, of which I spoke at thie&#xD;
opening of this chapter. The whole circle&#xD;
knew their chief, but remained silent for him&#xD;
to tell his story, and make the explanation,&#xD;
which they knew he would give.&#xD;
He advanced within the circle, and in quiet&#xD;
dignity told all, even to the poisoning of Sir&#xD;
Williamir Johnson, by the traitor, who cowered&#xD;
in their midst.-&#xD;
When he was done, an aged warrior arose&#xD;
and said&#xD;
"Brother, Father, and Chief! ewe welcome&#xD;
you as one who has come back from the api-&#xD;
nit-land to 'is ! Our hearts, which long bled&#xD;
for your loss, are made whole again I We&#xD;
will make a feast, and our people will all re-&#xD;
joice. Aid w en the hatchet is dug up, none&#xD;
but Ogahtee shluil lead the Mohawks on the&#xD;
war-path! I have spoken !"&#xD;
* 'when an Indian's crime, meriting death, _is dig'&#xD;
covered by ris brethren, ie is never or scarcely ev&#xD;
known to try to escape, but covering hia heat In dn&#xD;
pair from view, suienl awaits his trial a1 bladoe&#xD;
&#xD;
Ogah  , who had sat down, rose to his feet&#xD;
again and said&#xD;
'"My ears were open to my brother's words !&#xD;
But I mi old and my limbs are stiff, though&#xD;
my heart is warm and strong for my people.&#xD;
Thayendamriegea is amy only son. Yiou know&#xD;
that he is brave. Let hiimlead the Mohawks&#xD;
to the field. I have done "&#xD;
A single word, and that of approval from&#xD;
all the council, except. Ipisico and his doomed&#xD;
father, told how well the proposition was re-&#xD;
ceived. Thnvendanegea was their leader&#xD;
Anot her warrior now arose and demanded&#xD;
that the "snake" should be sentenced to his&#xD;
deserved doom. But Ogahtee rose and said:&#xD;
Brothers, it is not for us to defile our&#xD;
hands with his blood, lie has murdered a&#xD;
pale-face, let him meet his trial and his doom&#xD;
at their hands. Send him to the great castle,&#xD;
aid there let him te given up to those whom&#xD;
ie last wrnged. . For myself I forgive hin--&#xD;
I cannot trend upon a fallen foe !"&#xD;
Ai-olvadecka moaned in agony when he&#xD;
heard these words, for he would rather have-&#xD;
had every hatchet there used in chopping him&#xD;
limb from limb than meet the fate which nhe&#xD;
knew would he in store for him wien bis&#xD;
treachc(ry was knowth at Johnson iall.&#xD;
A  guard of young braves instantly aroseI&#xD;
and bore the wretched criminal away, while&#xD;
his shamed son slunk away from the'council.&#xD;
Then, with all formuality, the pipe was once&#xD;
more passed around and the council-fire put&#xD;
out.&#xD;
The council was over, and could not again&#xD;
be called but by order of the chief. Then,&#xD;
for the first time, glad shouts rent the air--&#xD;
gins were fired amnd a feast was quickly pre-&#xD;
lamed to show how gladly the Mohawks wei-&#xD;
comed Ogalitee bacJ--how they could best&#xD;
do hini iono'.&#xD;
CIIAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
Slowly and saly the funeral cortege which&#xD;
lad huried all that was mortal of Sir Wil-&#xD;
liam Johnsoni was returning to the hall. And&#xD;
at the same time, more rapidly, a large body&#xD;
of gailti-dressed Indians were approachinrg&#xD;
from the direction of the Mohawk village.&#xD;
Proudly, upon his coal-black steed, yet as&#xD;
fiery as when he first bestrode it, yet as all-&#xD;
obedient, rode Tlhayendannegea at their head,&#xD;
and hv his side, on either hand, rode Ogahtee&#xD;
and his noble mother, Dvagetto. And back&#xD;
in the centre, close boumid amid guarded, was&#xD;
Aroghryadecka, nolv so far back into the In-&#xD;
dian nood that slowed neither fear or contri-&#xD;
tion, but glared hatred and defiance upon -all&#xD;
around hun-&#xD;
The Indians moved more slowly as the sad&#xD;
array of mourners met their view, arnd it was&#xD;
not until mll Of the females had passed into&#xD;
the l.all, that Thayendanegen rode .up to the&#xD;
porch where Sir John Johnson and others,&#xD;
&#xD;
males, of the household waited to know the&#xD;
m wining of this visitation.,&#xD;
Why were you, of all the rest, away from&#xD;
t re funeral of my father, to whom you surely&#xD;
owed sonic duty ind respect ?" said Sir John,&#xD;
wit i stern sadness, to Tiharveridanegea.&#xD;
. I owed a duty and respect to my ow&#xD;
father. Ogahteethe Chief of the Mkewks !"&#xD;
Stil TIayendaniegea, proudly. as he pmuiited to&#xD;
his nohte-looking father. " An a datij I have&#xD;
done to you and yotfr fathers meniory, for I&#xD;
bring his murderer here for au to deal with!"&#xD;
lls murderer--my fatherasnnrdered!" cried&#xD;
Sir John. as he hookernt Arighvadeccka, who&#xD;
hiad been brought forward at a ,sign from\&#xD;
Thavendrnergea&#xD;
"Yes, I'kiiled him ;re would haverobbed&#xD;
me ofimy rights-I have lost nll now ; kill re&#xD;
if yon are not a coward !" cried Aroghva-s&#xD;
decka, who hoped, by exciting an instat re-&#xD;
venge, yet to escape the doom he most dread-&#xD;
ed !"'                i&#xD;
Madness-he was not slain, no mark of&#xD;

"Indian poison leaves no mark !" said the&#xD;
old Mohawk, With a sardonic smile.&#xD;
Who else can prove this, for sure!y the&#xD;
masn must he insane to thus counuit himself&#xD;
to a deed for which he shall hang so sure as it&#xD;
is truet"&#xD;
"Me--ion Yost--knows dat he did it, Sir&#xD;
Yohrn Yohuson," cried our old Dutch friend,&#xD;
pushing through the crowd which had gath,&#xD;
ered near. "i shmelt der erounrd-hemilrek in&#xD;

cried Sir John, now reddlenrirng with exeite-&#xD;

Then he bade- Thayendaneger arid iris friend.&#xD;

&#xD;
ment of the armed Highlanders under Me-&#xD;
Donald, in which the late baronet had taken&#xD;
such delight, and their stern visages and re-&#xD;
vengeful eves boded no good will to the con-&#xD;
demned prisoner, who stood upon its platform&#xD;
above their bayonets, ready to meet the fate&#xD;
to which he had been sentenced by stern and&#xD;
relentless judges.&#xD;
Around, also, as close as they could get,&#xD;
were the ninnytenants and retainers of the&#xD;
estate, prominent amongst whom were our&#xD;
friends Daly-not the Patrick-but the doctor,&#xD;
secretary Lafferty, Mr. O'Whackem, etc. But&#xD;
not a single Indian was in view .It was a&#xD;
sight which thfel more than all men on earth&#xD;
dread to see.&#xD;
Upon the scaffold beside Arozhyadecka&#xD;
Stood lion Yost, for he had asked the privi-&#xD;
lege of ianing "Old Tuyvelbug," to whom&#xD;
he had always felt an antipathy, but increased&#xD;
by the Indian's late attenipt upon his life.&#xD;
The rope was already around the Indian's&#xD;
neck, and but a touch of the tipping board,&#xD;
which served for a drop, was required to&#xD;
"launch him into eternity," as the reporters&#xD;
say.  But, by the looks occasionally cast&#xD;
around, it would seem  that Same one was&#xD;
waited for before the execution could be con-&#xD;
eluded.&#xD;
Many were the remarks made by the by-&#xD;
standers, but not one which exlitoited any&#xD;
feeling for the criminal, who stood like a&#xD;
bronze statue of defiant hate-a scowl upon&#xD;
his brow, a flashing pair of eyes, lips close&#xD;
drawn, and a form more firm than the stout&#xD;
post by his side.&#xD;
Faith, it's a stiff dance he'll make when&#xD;
he threads upon nothin'!" said Lafferty to&#xD;
O'Whackem. "There's never a quiver to lip,&#xD;
leg, or eye-lash !"&#xD;
"It's because we haven't any music for&#xD;
him, poor dog, If we had, he might give us&#xD;
$ semi-gainer at any rate !"&#xD;
OcI, boys, lie's no subject to be joking&#xD;
at I" said Doctor Daly.&#xD;
"Be asy now, doctor clear, an' jist think&#xD;
what you said at dinner 1" cried the school-&#xD;
master. "You were sayin' what a capital&#xD;
subject, he'd make for di section. Oeh, it's&#xD;
yourself will be cutting worse jokes on him&#xD;
directly, I'm a thinkin'!"&#xD;
This battle of words was now cut short by&#xD;
the appearance of those by whom he had&#xD;
been tried, who, with Sir John Johnson&#xD;
among them, approached, according to custom,&#xD;
to see their sentence executed.&#xD;
Now all was silence in the crowd ; for they&#xD;
felt what all must feel, no matter how vile the&#xD;
criminal, an inward thrill of horror at the&#xD;
approach of the very moment when a human&#xD;
being is to be coolly cast from life into the&#xD;
jaws of death, before theii- very eyes. Men,&#xD;
who glory in the sanguinary excitement of&#xD;
the battle-field, will shudder at such a mo-&#xD;
mnent.&#xD;
At this distance, when the signal was about&#xD;
&#xD;
to be given, the prisone, whose hands haa&#xD;
apparent'v been securely I on nd, raised both&#xD;
hands, whie. iii some way he had slipped&#xD;
from the cords which bound them, and, with&#xD;
the gickness of thought, slipped the noose&#xD;
from his neck, while Hon Yost stood aghast,&#xD;
and, with a wild yell of triumph, cast himself&#xD;
upon the tripple hedge of lifted bayonets&#xD;
below, meeting an almost instant death, and&#xD;
at last escaping the doom which lie niost&#xD;
dreaded !&#xD;
"Dnder! Mine Cot, vot a yump !" cried&#xD;
lon Yost, as he bent over the scafloldI, and&#xD;
looked upon the quivering body which the&#xD;
blood-hespotted soldiers were trying to disen-&#xD;
gage fLoin their bayonets.&#xD;
'The crowd uttered a groan of disappoint-&#xD;
mnent and turned awav; for tler knew that all&#xD;
was over with the poisoner of Sir William&#xD;
Johnson.&#xD;
"What d'ye think o' your subject now, doc-&#xD;
tor dear ?" asked O'Whaekem, as lie and his&#xD;
friends started homeward.&#xD;
"'T'hat he's like yourself, O'Whackem--a&#xD;
divilish had subject, and not worth the cut&#xD;
tin' up! " replied the doctor.&#xD;
"I'll he a subject if you'll stand trate, doe-&#xD;
tor !" said Lafferty.&#xD;
"I'm your man for that, my boy ; but what&#xD;
kind of a subject will you be !"&#xD;
"Faith, a dry one, ould saw-bones !"&#xD;
Thus joking, as the sons of Erin ever are,&#xD;
whether it be at a funeral or elsewhere, our&#xD;
friends " professional" passed on. and all was&#xD;
still and quiet, where the mangled body of&#xD;
Aroghryadeeka lay, for no one had touched it&#xD;
after the bayonets were withdrawn.&#xD;
It was an hour later, and gloom seemed to&#xD;
hang heavy in the sky, for dark arid lowering&#xD;
clouds were there. And all was still in tie&#xD;
grove, for no wind stirred the braneles of the&#xD;
gloomy pines. It seemed as if the spirits of&#xD;
tire air felt that the spot where the dead mur-&#xD;
derer lay was accursed, and while they hung&#xD;
tire heavy pail of gloom far, far above, below&#xD;
they would not come!&#xD;
But one cones shuddering amid creeping&#xD;
through the chill darkness-one who, though&#xD;
a coward. feared not to seek, perchance, his&#xD;
last friend upon earth-for the world hold-&#xD;
back in horror even from the son of a murs&#xD;
derer-and this was Ipisico, come to weep and&#xD;
moan above the mangled corpse of his father,&#xD;
whose brave leap from life to death he had&#xD;
witnessed from a tree-top, not very far away;&#xD;
but in which he had lain concealed until 'he&#xD;
felt certain io one was near tire body&#xD;
Oh, tell Inc not there is'a heart so bad in&#xD;
all this wide, wide world, in which there is&#xD;
not one good drop of blood. Inlrunman, as&#xD;
ignorant, is the humanity which would utter&#xD;
it.&#xD;
Here, in tire gloom of night, we see one of&#xD;
the worst of our characters-one who is cow-&#xD;
&#xD;
ardly,,treacherous, malicious, and false-with&#xD;
enough of filial love to seek his degraded pa-&#xD;
rent's corpse, perchanee to give it burial, nor&#xD;
leave it to the dogs or wolves, as better men&#xD;
would do-at least, to shed the tear of hor-&#xD;
row there.&#xD;
He finds all that is left of Aroghydtdecka,&#xD;
hose j'itts forgetting, we can half afford to&#xD;
pity, and easts himself upon it, with a low,&#xD;
wild moan, which speaks like the voice of a&#xD;
breaking heart.&#xD;
But, hark ! Quick, loud, and fearfuh another&#xD;
voice is heard. It is the voice of the storm&#xD;
which has been gathering in black silence&#xD;
overhead. The bursting thunder shakes the&#xD;
earth ! The red lightning leaps along the&#xD;
sky, stoops down to earth, shattering every-&#xD;
thing it meets, scattering only when its fiery&#xD;
work is done.&#xD;
Aht! see, a red bolt strikes the gallows tree&#xD;
--down it speeds on him who can feel but&#xD;
heeds not, on the senseless corpse as well-&#xD;
and Ipisico is beyond the reach of hate and&#xD;
acorn-his freed spirt speeds on wings of ire&#xD;
to look for that of his father in the hunting-&#xD;
grounds abbe !&#xD;
CIIAPTER    XXXIII.&#xD;
Once more, reader, leap with me over a&#xD;
lapse of time, which, though full of thrilling&#xD;
incidents, all closely linked with the struggle&#xD;
cf out' bravo forefathers for freedom, still may&#xD;
not be embh'raced within the narrow limits of&#xD;
a novelette, as this only professes to be.&#xD;
This much I will say: Guy Johnson, after&#xD;
becoming the king's superintendent of Indian&#xD;
affairs, through a manoeuvre characteristic of&#xD;
. Iimsclf-and'you already know him-married&#xD;
Leoniore public, though she long had been&#xD;
his wife; and Onalova became the bride of&#xD;
Sir John Johnson, against the will of Ogahtee&#xD;
and Dyagetto, who, proud of their blood,&#xD;
would not that one of their race should link&#xD;
withia pale face ; and Sir John, having iro-&#xD;
ken his parole to the American cause, had&#xD;
been long driven front his immense and fair do-&#xD;
mains, whieh were confiscated to the patriot&#xD;
cause, and ie, made a general in the British&#xD;
eause, haid raised a large body of Canadians&#xD;
and tries called tire "Johnson Greens," and,&#xD;
with all the confederacy of the Six Nations,&#xD;
except the brave 'and true Oinedias, to aid&#xD;
him, with-Thray entdriegea at their head-he,&#xD;
who'now was known as tine " Scourge of the&#xD;
Pale-Faces, and the War--Ed^e of the Mo-&#xD;
hawks "-ie, Sir John, wvith Guy Johnson :tiid&#xD;
the ever-iifamols Butlers, Wakter and John,&#xD;
was sweeping our the flair Vrlley of the Mo-&#xD;
hawk, down upon tie Delaware, the Susque-&#xD;
hanna, the Unadilla, and the Schroharie, to&#xD;
the error atnd lestruetion of all that caea in&#xD;
the way, of life and property.&#xD;
So mueh for a bird's-eye glance at some of&#xD;
our characters, which could  not ,well be&#xD;
&#xD;
avoided ; and, now, back to our story, and let&#xD;
incidents work their way once more.&#xD;
Come with me to ~the lovely "alley of the&#xD;
Unadilla. It is night, and, in a forest dense&#xD;
and lofty, behold a hundred gleaming fires,&#xD;
and around them   grouped five hundretl&#xD;
b Bronzed  anid well-a'rmed  Indian  warriors.&#xD;
Who is this, tall and nobly formed, yet&#xD;
silent and stern, that stands iv a line fire,&#xD;
all solitary and apart from the rest? It is the&#xD;
great War-Eagle--it is Thav'endnnegra--and&#xD;
these are not a tithe of the 'ed warriors who&#xD;
look to him as their master-sidrit and their&#xD;
leader. Why stands he there so proud andn al&#xD;
alone?. He feels hims.If a very king, anid&#xD;
though his throne is the heaf-strewed ground,&#xD;
his canopy the star gemined sky, his sceptre&#xD;
the rifle in his hand,Iris truncheon the hatchet&#xD;
in his helt, his crown the eagle plumes a'ov&#xD;
his lofty brow, few monarchs more potent in&#xD;
their realm than he.&#xD;
Ai! there comes a pale-face, all as fully&#xD;
armed, threading his way along among the&#xD;
warriors and 'their fires to that of Thayen-&#xD;
daneea.&#xD;
"Well, lion Yost, what news ?" asks the&#xD;
ehief, haughtily.&#xD;
"Vel, Mister Var-Eagle, de news is yust&#xD;
dis," said our old Duteh friend:  " Yeneral&#xD;
Ierkimer has come to Unradilla all de var fur&#xD;
to see yos. Dat I finds out vile I plays de&#xD;
fool in his camp."&#xD;

The chief then called a subordinate to his&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
-       It was morniiniand the sun rose upon a&#xD;
lovely sceine. Out beyond a forest, dense and&#xD;
dark,~that wherein lay Thavendniegea and&#xD;
iPis shan, was a lovely plain, and it was d0t-&#xD;
ted with the white tents of the little but well-&#xD;
appointed army of the brave IIerkiner. There&#xD;
the music of muteving men, turning out for&#xD;
guard-miounting, could be heard, and bright&#xD;
arms gittered in the rays of the just-risen sun.&#xD;
And white pillars of smoke rose from their&#xD;
many eamnp-tires and vanished away in the&#xD;
blue ether above.&#xD;
But from that forest of dark green, ro&#xD;
smoke cloud rose to tell where the army of&#xD;
the forest king was encamped, or what his&#xD;
numbers were. lie was too wary for that.&#xD;
It was enough for him to assure his pale-&#xD;
faced opponent of the presence of Indians&#xD;
there, lv sending out small pickets of red-&#xD;
skiued 'varrwirs, who, in their bright blan-&#xD;
kets ntid eagle plumes, strode to and fro in&#xD;
front of the edge of the forest, often vanishing&#xD;
back into its shadows, then coming out again&#xD;
A little later, and. with a bugle sounding at&#xD;
their he-n 1 nl a white flag borne by one of&#xD;
the numler, a land of gaily-dressed officers&#xD;
gallop from the Continental camp upon their&#xD;
dashngru. chargers toward the forest.  And&#xD;
then, advanring to meet them, on foot, but&#xD;
slowly, and with haughty steps, a band of the&#xD;
red men coei forth from their overt of green.&#xD;
-     They bear an answering flag of truce.&#xD;
The parties meet and halt.&#xD;
" What do the pale-faces want?" asked the&#xD;
leader of the body of red men.&#xD;
" I wish to see Thayeradanegea I" said&#xD;
'  General Ierkimer himself.&#xD;
"Wait till lie comes," was the reply given&#xD;
by that subordinate chief, fbr such he only&#xD;
was, in a tone as haughty as if ie were talk-&#xD;
ing only to a slave. And then he uttered a veil&#xD;
imore loud and shrill than any clarion blast&#xD;
that ever rairt the air.&#xD;
An answeringc r ywas heard from the leafy&#xD;
shrales bond, anm soon,.more plainly cladI,&#xD;
'?      lir hbittr armed than any warrior of that&#xD;
little lanir , a tingle Indian came forth from&#xD;
tie for t, atl strode with a stately s'ep to-&#xD;
ward tinr. his eagle eye, his tall form, his&#xD;
; roid step.hut too plainly told that it was&#xD;
thmavrndaeneg&amp;amp;ea who came. As ie advanced,&#xD;
Iis warriors drew up in a half circle, antd,upon&#xD;
the ro;lter side, the whites did the sate, bay.&#xD;
dinag 'hirrmunrted from their horses.&#xD;
&#xD;
Th'ayendanegea stopped within the circle&#xD;
3 so formed ; and. as General llerkntirte stepped&#xD;
forward, the chieft ian stood with fobl-led rmis&#xD;
across his breast, not deigning to see the ex-&#xD;
tending hand which the general meant to&#xD;
offer him, and said&#xD;
"Why have you come here so near to my&#xD;
camp1 '-&#xD;
'Upon a friendly visit!" was the general's&#xD;
reply; " we are. old neighbors and friends,&#xD;
and must not war together ! "&#xD;
"Have all those pale-faces come upon a&#xD;
friendly visit, too ?" asked the chief.  " All&#xD;
want to see us poor Indians?    It is vcry&#xD;
kind I"&#xD;
An'd the curl of his proud lip, and the flash&#xD;
of his dark eve, told what ie felt and meant -&#xD;
while, as he -spoke, he pointed to the distant&#xD;
tents, and the men gathered there in crowds&#xD;
to look at the interview.&#xD;
" I would like to visit yosin your camp !"&#xD;
said the general, wishing still to preserve a&#xD;
friendly bearing with the haughty ehiet-&#xD;
My camp is too small for so big a chief&#xD;
as you.   You are near enough !" was the&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
--"Why do yrur people make war uion our&#xD;
people it the Valley of the Mohawk !" now&#xD;
asked the old general, corning at once to the&#xD;
object of his visit.&#xD;
"Because you war upon King George, who&#xD;
is our friend. his belts we wear-we are his&#xD;
men !" was the calm reply.&#xD;
"But you are wrong. Our forces are strong,&#xD;
like the trees of the forest ; in number, like&#xD;
the leaves upon the trees  We can sweep&#xD;
away all our foes, as the fire burns the dry&#xD;
grass in the fall!"&#xD;
Thayendanegea laughed scornfully, and ut,-&#xD;
tered a shrill yell. In a moment, more than&#xD;
five hundred painted  and  nrmed warriors&#xD;
burst from the forest with deafening whoops,&#xD;
discharged their guns ; then, at a wave of&#xD;
'rhayenidnanegea's hand, fell back in silence out&#xD;
of view.&#xD;
'Coant these an hundred times, and yet more&#xD;
warriors cn I bring into the field !" cried&#xD;
''hayendanegea, haughtily.  "Go back, and&#xD;
tell those so who sent you here !  You are in&#xD;
my power; but we have been neighbors and&#xD;
friends, and I will do you no harm !"&#xD;
Tfie chief said, nor would ie hear any&#xD;
more, but strode back as Ie came, full as&#xD;
proudly as a king with millions.at his back.&#xD;
And the pale-faces dared not follow him,&#xD;
for the advantages upon his side were far too&#xD;
great for threm to risk a battle.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
A lofty luill, rock-ribbed but tree-crowned,&#xD;
is that which overlooks from its southern&#xD;
hank the Mohawk at its Little Falls , And&#xD;
from this lofty height the eye cart stretch far&#xD;
&#xD;
away along the. thread of silvery water from&#xD;
mast to west, and gaze with pleasure down&#xD;
upon the rushing, foaming, flashing torreints&#xD;
hat dashes by below.&#xD;
Upon this height, some time after Thayen-&#xD;
danegea had met the fearless IIerkimer at&#xD;
Ulnadilla, stood two women.   One, whose&#xD;
hairs beginning to speck with threads of gray,&#xD;
proves that age is coming fast upon her, or&#xD;
that care is dongt the work of time, is our old&#xD;
friend Dyagetto, the mother of the Eagle of&#xD;
be Mohawks. Still stern and commanding,&#xD;
till beautiful, still every inch a forest queen,&#xD;
but yet looking far more sadly than when we&#xD;
saw her last-for then she was all radiant&#xD;
with joy in the recovery of a long-lost hus-&#xD;
band-min the triumph of her noble boy.&#xD;
But yho is this by her side? An Indian&#xD;
maideni; yet for such, how peerlessly beauti-&#xD;
ful ! Tall, of exquisite form, so well revealed&#xD;
by her forestngarb,'with eyes large, black as&#xD;
starless night, yet so piercing that they seem&#xD;
at times to look you through, and then&#xD;
again to melt into your very soul with their&#xD;
liquid light-features which can express- the&#xD;
haughty pride of a chrainless will, or yet the&#xD;
tender thoughts of a heart which can love in&#xD;
spite of the pride which bids it own no rns-&#xD;
ter.    . .  .   .&#xD;
The picture is drawn; but who-wro is she&#xD;
that tams breaks, in majestic beauty, in upon&#xD;
the ivil i panorama of our story ? Let the se-&#xD;
quel tell.&#xD;
They stand upon tie very verge of tie&#xD;
cliff which overtops the stream below, look-&#xD;
ing with strung eyes up the river, as if from&#xD;
thence a visit was expected.&#xD;
. Baek from them, in a lovely grove of cedar,&#xD;
is a single wigwam, and the small fire before&#xD;
it shows that it is their camp. And but a&#xD;
little way to the left is a iound of newly-&#xD;
heaped-up ground. Can it-be that, " dust re-&#xD;
turned to dus' is reposing there, and'that&#xD;
death has laid another of -his countless vie-&#xD;
tims there ?.&#xD;
"Your eyes, so 'young and bright; loan,&#xD;
niust surely see a speck far up ite iver !"&#xD;
said .ya etto to the maiden a~ lier side.&#xD;
"IHis runner srid thatirewould be here when&#xD;
the sun was s+ high that i4 ease n) shadow&#xD;
from upright _tree, and Thtayendanegea&#xD;
never spoke false words '  -&#xD;
" I see nothtingt; but- aidtek upon the river's.&#xD;
breast !'' saidthe nniden. ." Anti it is not yet&#xD;
his time; tr, see, our shadows fill yet toward&#xD;
the west !"..&#xD;
"I'.ona does not love, else she would not be&#xD;
so patient. Time is stnail, it only ertawls!",&#xD;
- low can I lvoa him, whom my eyes,&#xD;
have not looked .upon ?" said the makfen,&#xD;
cahnly.&#xD;
his nsante-his fame-le is chief of all&#xD;
the Nations of the Norah -lie is my Son !"&#xD;
aid 1)ya. ett, imipetuonsly.&#xD;
-lie Irmay rutiu anll tine warrior; of the North,&#xD;
&#xD;
and yet not hold control of one proud heart !"&#xD;
said the maiden, with a flashing eye, while&#xD;
she pressed her hand over her heart, to indi-&#xD;
cate her meaning.   Then she adied, more&#xD;
calmly : " When I look upon him, if he is&#xD;
what I have seen in my dreams, I shall love&#xD;
him, and if I love him, he must love me, and&#xD;
I 'viii win him or I will die !"&#xD;
"Surely now I see something far up the&#xD;
river !" said Dyagetto.  -&#xD;
" Yes !" said Iona; "it is the flash of a&#xD;
paddle, dipping up water in the sun-rays!"&#xD;
After a short pause, she said :&#xD;
"It is a Canoe, and there are t-wo in'it; and&#xD;
one is a warrior, tie other is a worhan. IIe&#xD;
said he would come alone !"&#xD;
And already, though she sail she loved not,&#xD;
the maiden's eyes flashed, and a fierce look&#xD;
told that she fancied a rival ere she had found&#xD;
a love. In some hearts jealousyy is natural,&#xD;
intuitive, and in such hearts to love is to ho&#xD;
forever miserable I&#xD;
Swiftly down the rapid stream, more swift-&#xD;
ly as they drew nearer to the falls, canoe the&#xD;
canoe, and both the wovnen watceld its mo&#xD;
tions without a word, for though Dvrgetto's&#xD;
face expressed surprise, not uminnxed with&#xD;
anger when the keen eyes of lona saw, andn&#xD;
her lips announced, that there was a woman&#xD;
in the canoe with the warrior, sine spoke not&#xD;
the thoughts which gathered in her brain.&#xD;
The canoe, coming down the centre of the&#xD;
stream to take advantage.of the eur-knnt, shot&#xD;
along almost to tie falls; then ''havendanegea,&#xD;
with a powerful arm, turned its irw v'toward&#xD;
the shiore, and in a tnornent more was there.&#xD;
'-A'pale-faced wonhan, lerhiaps a prisoner!"&#xD;
muttered Dyagetto.&#xD;
If Thay endanegea is so gentle to a pri-&#xD;
soner, vhat woald- he be to a wife ?' said&#xD;
Ionn, as' she saw him carefully lift the lale-&#xD;
faced maiden Un the 'ockv bank. The sar-&#xD;
easm in tire tone of"Iona was rot lost on Dy-&#xD;
agetto, who replied&#xD;
"Thayendanegea brings no pale-faced wife&#xD;

Carefully up t he roecky'height the War-&#xD;

"Was she not the 1ovi laias maiden&#xD;
&#xD;
whom I saw when we came here ?" asked&#xD;
Kathleen, timidly, of Dyagetto.&#xD;
" Yes. I will go seek her," said Dyagetto,&#xD;
speaking more kindly, perhaps, for toe uncon-&#xD;
scious compliment paid to her favorite by the&#xD;
por girl.&#xD;
The woman departed, taking the path&#xD;
which Imoa had chosen. She soon returned&#xD;
with the Indian mtiden, whose eyes indicated&#xD;
by their looks that she, proud as she was, had&#xD;
beei weeping.&#xD;
"This is lONA, the daughter of a chief of&#xD;
the Sonceas, who fell in battle by the side of&#xD;
the brave IIendrick !" said Dvagetto, as she&#xD;
proudly led her protegee forward. " And,"&#xD;
she added, " 1 have taken ieres my da-ughter,&#xD;
tor I have lost Onalova, who choe a pale.&#xD;
fac-, and took herself out from her mother's&#xD;
heart&#xD;
And Dfyagetto, as she uttered these words,&#xD;
so full of meaning. looked at Thnayendanegea,&#xD;
to see the effect of them.&#xD;
But his eyes were fixed upon Ione, who&#xD;
stood with eyes downcast before him.&#xD;
"She is too big for a woman---she should&#xD;
have been a warrior, like her father!" said&#xD;
Thayendanegea.&#xD;
"It I aim a woman, I have a Warrior's&#xD;
heart in my bosom !" said loon, and nmow her&#xD;
raised eves flashed back a 'light as proud as&#xD;
that of his own.&#xD;
"Good ! You shall be my sister, like this&#xD;
poor lily of the pale-faces. whom  1 found far&#xD;
from  the wigwams of her friends, and have&#xD;
taken to be my sister !" said Thayendateega,&#xD;
and be took Kathleen by the had and led her&#xD;
forward. " Be sisters," he added, "aand I&#xD;
will see that neither of you go hungry or&#xD;
meet with harm !"&#xD;
loon drew up haughtily, and would have&#xD;
refused the ready hand ot' at hleen, had shine&#xD;
not caught the warning look of the crafty&#xD;
Dyagetto, which told her not to do so, anl&#xD;
she took it, and said:&#xD;
"What the great War-Etagle of the Mo-&#xD;
hawks speaks must he good. I will lie hcs&#xD;

" I sun far froni all other sisters, and will&#xD;

took the hand'of Jona ; but she almost shud-&#xD;

Thie air is close, yet clear, though rising&#xD;
clouds in the far east betokened a'storm to be&#xD;

forest ; but we hear the clatter of horses' feet,&#xD;
the tramp of armed men, the hurried word of&#xD;
command.    Ah, see, they come, under the&#xD;
flag of the United Coloies-old men, nil&#xD;
middle aged, apd young-some in uniform,&#xD;
and some in none, but a soldier, every one&#xD;
ready to battle, and, if need be, to die for their&#xD;
country's cause. On, with the veteran Herki-&#xD;

.-From behind every tree, and roek, and htish,&#xD;

with all his bravado, is down. Davis, Vaa&#xD;

kr, on the night after his retreat from the&#xD;
fearful fight at Oriskany, in whclh his Mo-&#xD;
hawks arid Senecas had suffered so fearfully.&#xD;
IIe spoke to a warrior who certainly did&#xD;
Y t seem  over, eighteen. it so much; yet he&#xD;
was of powerul build, so far as eould ibe&#xD;
judged-though his caped hunting-shirt, fast-&#xD;
eiet to the neck, did not expose what seemed&#xD;
to be a frill amd brawny Chest so mnch as the&#xD;
open and careless garb, or no garbm, of other&#xD;
warriors; and his wide leggins, extending to&#xD;
his ankles, concealed limbs, which should have&#xD;
ben muscular. But, whatever his build, in&#xD;
that day's fight Ie had shown himself inferior&#xD;
k* skijl and valor to none but the great War-&#xD;
&#xD;
Eagle himself, and thrice, at the rik, of his&#xD;
own, had saved the chieft:in's hie:&#xD;
He wore his war-paint so tidekly, and a&#xD;
heavy turban so shaded his brow, that of his&#xD;
loIeks we can say'but little, except that hisfaoe&#xD;
seemed boyish ;;but. his eye--it spoke a heart&#xD;
wilder, fiercer than that in the tameless eagle.&#xD;
or the merciless tiger of the nrth.&#xD;
Are yoi a-Moh-wk?'continued the gross&#xD;
chief.&#xD;
"I wish I   are,'that the great War-Rtado&#xD;
could call me brother; that I could fi;ht for-&#xD;
ever by his side, sleep only at his fire mint&#xD;
only for him, and be his guard at all time,:by&#xD;
night and by' day-; but I am a Seneca by&#xD;
birth !" said 4he yottng Indian, modestly, 'but&#xD;
not without enthusiasau.&#xD;
" You shall have your, wist! Before ail&#xD;

Thayendanegea, pleased with tie earnest en-&#xD;
thus.asi of his 'newly-adopted brother.&#xD;
."Theni I am contat-ias lifa--in death'--I&#xD;
will be as I was to-day !" said the yong nL-&#xD;
dian, and his form sceeied to grow more tall.&#xD;
and his eye more-bright, and his breast to ex-&#xD;
paul withhappiness as he spoke.&#xD;
What wonder? No higher honor could -b&#xD;
given to a warrior iui the 3ix Nations'thaihe&#xD;
had received--he was to he thenceforth the&#xD;
brother and lifergaard of the great head. of&#xD;
the confederacy.&#xD;
.  Where is'1hayemdanegea?" asked a shirp,&#xD;
imperative'voioe near them at that moment&#xD;
"I am here. Waat does 'Walter Buler want&#xD;
of me?' asked the chief,' haughtily, and ens.&#xD;
phasisimg the name which he uttered, as it&#xD;
he, did not like the man, or rater the jpoet&#xD;
who asked for him.&#xD;
' General St. Leger has ordered moe p iion&#xD;
secret mission of great imaportauce-I ari to&#xD;
take fifteen men and you the same. Hon Yost,&#xD;
whom you know, is to be our guide !"&#xD;
"Where is the order? I an iny mn ci a&#xD;

"Is not; my word suffieient;?"asked Butler,&#xD;
impatiently.&#xD;
"I will take the ford of no pale-face, belhe&#xD;
friend or foe. Let the _general send his or-&#xD;

Butler turned away, and went for the order,&#xD;
for he dared not triflo with 'the man who bad&#xD;
hut to speak to have his scalp stripped feom&#xD;
his head.&#xD;
Not even didSt Leger dare to thwart the&#xD;
proud Mohawk in hi ,ways.&#xD;
Butler soon returned, and he bore a polite&#xD;
note from General St. Leger, in which the la+.&#xD;
ter requested -Thayendanegen, the great chief&#xD;
of the Six Nations, to accompany Lieutenant&#xD;
Walter Butler upon an expedition of'groat&#xD;

Butler bit his lip, and a frown was on his&#xD;
brow ; for,,aristocratie and tyrannical himself,;&#xD;
he eould nt bear a master, but he turned and&#xD;
went for his rren.&#xD;
The first of the patty who made his appear.&#xD;
anee was Hon Yost, evidently having a good&#xD;
m'ad of the "ardent" on boursd, and carrying&#xD;
a bottle of the same in his han/..&#xD;

lion}Yost for a moment stood 'aghast. He&#xD;
looked first at the fragments of the bottle, aml&#xD;
thid at the chief, paused a moment, and then,&#xD;
handing him his pipe, said :&#xD;

Tlayendanegea now gave a low call, nail&#xD;
a suiordinate chief appeared, whom he di-&#xD;
s'eded to pick out fifteen men, true and trusty,&#xD;
for the expedition.&#xD;

" We are but one, and I name you Niscayu-&#xD;

He examined Niseayugra's rifle, and said:&#xD;

x4                    CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
About two miles above Fort Dayton, stood&#xD;
one of those old-fashioned Dutch houses-of&#xD;
which few specimens are now to be seen in&#xD;
the Mohawk Valley-large gabled structures,&#xD;
as full of windows as an ancient village maid-&#xD;
en is of gab-no offence venerable virgins, but&#xD;
I must Cr:ve a comparison, even if it is at your&#xD;
expense-nnd, at the time of which I write,&#xD;
it was pretty well filled with a party of stories,&#xD;
or of those who, sedueod by the specious pro-&#xD;
&#xD;
clamations of General St. Leger, a..i the feat&#xD;
that their property would be destroyed by the&#xD;
advancing foe, wese'being inehned to bke the&#xD;
side of King-Geerge,&#xD;
.They were a higglepiggled set, Scotch,&#xD;
Dutch, but,-to-their credit be it said-in that&#xD;
day there were'very few Irish disinelined to&#xD;
our patriot cause. Tie proprietor of this&#xD;
mnrision was a- regtular-built, ,fill-ri:tged, old&#xD;
tory hessian, by birth and nature. his name&#xD;
was-Diedrich Schoomaker, yet so careful had&#xD;
he beep to conceal his sentinments, th:t the&#xD;
Tryon County Committee had not shipped him&#xD;
off, or looked to his nodious aufhcietly tQ de-&#xD;
teet him'in his'evil deeds. his house, being&#xD;
back from the main-road and in an out-of-the-&#xD;
was situation, suited the tories eceeently for&#xD;
a r'ndc:vous, and ,as such it had bern used&#xD;
8siree the commnencement of the war.&#xD;
It was fall niidnight, and the great kitchen&#xD;
and dinner-room--both being   one in such&#xD;
houses-was pretty ubarly crammed with men&#xD;
of the class which I have named. Diedrich&#xD;
Schooraker was in his glory, for he presided&#xD;
over a puncheon of rum in one corner, from&#xD;
which he measured half-pints as tast as they&#xD;
were called for, and that was about as fast as&#xD;
they could be drawn by him.&#xD;
" The health of.King George," was the only&#xD;
toast allowed to be drunk, an- "success to his&#xD;
cause" waste general ad  ition after the drink-&#xD;
er had recovered his breath.&#xD;
- Though most of those present seemed very&#xD;
well contented with their cheer and their eon.&#xD;
p:any, some there, were who exhibited great&#xD;
impatience, and cursed more than a lit.le--&#xD;
somewhat as the army is said to have done in&#xD;
Flanders-because some person or persons cx-&#xD;
pected did not make his or their appearance.&#xD;
It was, perhaps, an half hour after mid-&#xD;
night, when a person hastily entered from&#xD;
without, and immediately one of the loudest&#xD;
of tIe grumblers cried out:&#xD;
"Gentlemen. come to order and make room,&#xD;
for the deputation from the camp pf General&#xD;
St. Leger has just arrived, and will enter the&#xD;
room in one moment 1"&#xD;
"Yes! and yust make room from pefore&#xD;
mine rum parcel, for dey'll Ipe sure to be dry,"&#xD;
cried the hospitable and most loyal Diedrich&#xD;
A moment later, and.Thavendanegen, who&#xD;
allowed no man to precede him, either in&#xD;
war or peace, strode into the room, followed&#xD;
by fourteen of his fierce-looking warriors,&#xD;
Niscayuna being close by his side. Walter&#xD;
Butler, headed by Ion Yost, and followed ;y.&#xD;
fourteen of his men, came next.&#xD;
There was no need to say make room. When&#xD;
the people glanced at the great War-Eagle&#xD;
ard his followers, they fell hack like sheep be.&#xD;
fore a pauk of ,wolves, and he moved to the&#xD;
upper end of the room, near where Diedrich&#xD;
Schoornaker was, through a broad avenue.&#xD;
"Crest Mr. Injun, vi~ you rind your mena&#xD;
have a trink r' cried Died-ieh, wishing at creeo&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WAR-EAGLE OF TIHE MOTIAWKS.&#xD;
&#xD;
to make favor with that party, and he ad-&#xD;
vanced with a gallon measure of rum in his&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
" Curse your fire-water-Mohawks are not&#xD;
beasts !" said Thayendanege:a, indignantly, as&#xD;
he struck the measure from the astonished&#xD;
Diedrich's hand, and spilled its contents upon&#xD;
the floor, which needed washing with rome&#xD;
kind of liquid.&#xD;
"Mein Cot in himmels, vat a       aste !'&#xD;
groaned Ilon Yost, who was, as if by scent,&#xD;
finding his way to the rum-puncheon with all&#xD;
haste.&#xD;
"'It is late, and this meeting will at- once&#xD;
Crme to order, to hear the proclamation&#xD;
which I have the honor to offer inthe name of&#xD;
General Parry" St. Leger," said Lieutenant&#xD;
Baitier. mounting a very appropriate stand for&#xD;
a spirited address, it being the head of Died-&#xD;
rich's rum barrel. " But before I read the&#xD;
proclamation, copies of which I have for gen-&#xD;
eral distribution, I will say," continued the&#xD;
lieutenant, "that, in the troops of both classes&#xD;
which I have brought here, not as a guard, but&#xD;
as a specimen, you see only a few outof thou-&#xD;
sands just like them who must-"&#xD;
" Surrender to the arms of the Continental&#xD;
Congress !" shouted an officer, at the door,&#xD;
who was dressed in the uniform of the Ameri-&#xD;
can army. "You are surrounded-resistance is&#xD;
useless-he dies who tries to escape t"&#xD;
With  a wild bound, and Niscaryuna by his&#xD;
side, Thayendanegea sprung through the pas-&#xD;
sage by which he had entered. His warriors&#xD;
would have followed, but the terrified crowd&#xD;
closed in, and cut thers off from their leader.&#xD;
All was terror, shouts, confusion I&#xD;
-eatla, nota second, and the War-Eagle,&#xD;
ndiching his tomahawk in his hand and ut-&#xD;
tering his terrible yell, which was known but&#xD;
too well, was at the door-out of it, upon the&#xD;
soldiers who were placed before it: 'Iwo fell&#xD;
before his blows, another dropped beneath&#xD;
Niscaynna's hand, and they were clear ; for&#xD;
the line was broken, and tley were speeding&#xD;
off like deer in the gloom beyond pursuit. A&#xD;
few scattering shots were fired after them, but&#xD;
they were far tide of their mark. Soon the&#xD;
forest was gained, and then Thayendanegea&#xD;
paused, and said&#xD;
"My brave brother, we are safe!I"&#xD;
"Tire Great Spirit protects the brave and&#xD;
.the good I" said Niscayuna, as he pressed the&#xD;
hand of the War-Eagle.&#xD;
They were safe ; but where were their late&#xD;
companions? Let us go back and see.&#xD;
Scarcely had Thayendanegea and Niscayu-&#xD;
ns escaped from the room, when, from every&#xD;
evenu-, Con neutal soldiers entered with fixed&#xD;
bayonets ; at every window  glittering steel&#xD;
_     was seen.  Those within saw but too plainly&#xD;
bow mad aand useless it would be to resist.&#xD;
Even the Indians were panic-strieken, and&#xD;
stood quiet and waited for the result.&#xD;
"   aSurrender, sir !" said an officer, approach-&#xD;
ig Walter Butler.&#xD;
&#xD;
60&#xD;
&#xD;
" To whom r' said Butler, turning pale, for&#xD;
he knew tihe doom generally awarded to a spy,&#xD;
or an pnemy who sought to incite people to&#xD;
rebellion.&#xD;
'Colonel Weston, ,of the    Continental&#xD;
army !" ciied the officer, reaching lrii hand for&#xD;
Butler's sword, which was delivered&#xD;
" Cot in himmels, I surrender, too 1" said&#xD;
Hon Yost, as he bent down before DiedricWe&#xD;
rum pnneheon, and surrendered himself to fuli&#xD;
a pint of its contents.&#xD;
The soldiers and Indians were all speedily&#xD;
disarmed; such of the persons present as we&#xD;
known tories were secured, while the rest were -&#xD;
dismissed, with the information that Genera)&#xD;
Arnold, with a powerful force, was at Fort&#xD;
Dayton, and would not onlysweep the enemy&#xD;
from the land, but severely punish all who&#xD;
'were recreant to the cause. And as the young&#xD;
hero, then, of St. Johns, Montreal, the pasgetge&#xD;
of the Kenaiebee and Chandierre, was iii the&#xD;
zenith of his fame, and known to be as severe&#xD;
as he was brave, the cheek of Butler paisd;&#xD;
for he knew that of all others, he would, be&#xD;
one who, from rhis position, past and preset,&#xD;
it would be desirable to make an example  f,&#xD;
The   prisoners, properly secured, were&#xD;
soon marched off to Fort Dayton;,and, as might&#xD;
have been supposed from what Arnold awas&#xD;
then, an immediate court-mirtial was ordered.&#xD;
Its result must be the subject of another '&#xD;

The court-martial was over. Walter But-&#xD;
her, Hon Yost Schuyler, and others, were&#xD;
found guilty as spies and sentenced to death !&#xD;
Butler'founm friends. Even then as mnw, ar-&#xD;
istocratic associations, money and family had&#xD;
influence, and, at the intercession of so many&#xD;
persons as these attributes could bring to&#xD;
bear, Arnold was persuaded to reprieve But-&#xD;
ler and send him to Albany, frorn whence he&#xD;
soon made Iis escape-to become the most dia-&#xD;
holical scourge the Mohawk county ever&#xD;
knew. Even then Arnold seemed to begin to&#xD;
feel a sympathy for villany !&#xD;
But poor Hon Yost had no friends-no&#xD;
money-but little sense-it would do to have&#xD;
him dangle in the air, and to say a spy. had&#xD;
been hung I Oh, yes! as even now, so jus-&#xD;
tice was then. A starving begear steals a&#xD;

turpitude, excuse the fault, sprinkle a little&#xD;
perfume upon their garments, and sweet So-&#xD;
ciety draw them back to thy spotless bosom I&#xD;
A poor lost girl may be found wandering in&#xD;
the streets. to jail with her, while her wealthy&#xD;
seducer seeks another victim!&#xD;
Hon Yost was condemned to die. The gal-&#xD;
lows was erected. The rope was ready. The&#xD;
hour was named. Troops were ordered out&#xD;
to guard the proceedings.&#xD;
I said that he had no friends. Ah, wh:lo&#xD;
she lives there is one friend who never will&#xD;
desert us ; in peril, in crime, in tribulation a&#xD;
mother will cling to her son!&#xD;
Arnold, having given all ttie necessary or-&#xD;
ders for the execution 0t the unapphy Dtutch-&#xD;
man, had gone into the house, with some offi.&#xD;
cers, to wash down any qualms which he&#xD;
might have had with a few glasses of wine&#xD;
The glass was at His lips when an aged wo-&#xD;
man, wild and gipsy-like in look and dress,&#xD;
rushed into the room and knelt at his feet,&#xD;
crying for mercy, in the name of God, for&#xD;
poor lion Yost. It was his mother who&#xD;
plead. Her furrowed face, brown and care-&#xD;
worn-her streaming gray hairs, tears pou r-&#xD;
ing out in floods, her sobs and moans should&#xD;
have tonlehitd a heart of stone.&#xD;
But Arnold would not hear or heed her.&#xD;
Another pleatver came ; a man with more&#xD;
heart and sener than the other, and he even&#xD;
offered to suffer im sis stead, " for," said he,&#xD;
"lion Yost is my in other, and he is itr ore than&#xD;
&#xD;
ha'f. an idiot. Ie has lived with the Indians&#xD;
and the Johnson clan alt his life, and they&#xD;
have influenced him. I am a mhn ad know&#xD;
what I am about. Hang mc in his stead, and&#xD;
spare himli .1"&#xD;
E m to this appeal the then less than man&#xD;
and after traitor closed his ears.&#xD;
But now another influence was brought to&#xD;
bear. Colonel Willett whispered a word in&#xD;
Arnold's ear.&#xD;
The latter listened to the suggestions offer-&#xD;
ed. lie ordered every officer out of the room&#xD;
but Colonel Willett, bidding the mother and&#xD;
brother of lion Yost to remain. lie thea&#xD;
gave orders to have lion Yost brought before&#xD;
The latter was led in, closely bound and&#xD;
guarded by a file of soldiers. They were or-&#xD;
dered out, and then Arnold harshly addressed&#xD;
the poor, pale, trembling creature, who, how-&#xD;
ever brave lie might have been elsewhere,&#xD;
was now dreadIfully terrified.&#xD;
" Villsn," said the greater villain of the&#xD;
two, "I am about to have you hung; but&#xD;
you nay say good-bye to your mother and&#xD;
brother here !"-&#xD;
"Oh. mine Cot, Mister Yeneral, ton't hang&#xD;
poor lion Yost !" cried the nihappy fellow,&#xD;
dropping on his knees.&#xD;
"What will you do for me if I intercede for&#xD;
your life ?" asked Colonel Willett.&#xD;
- Any dog--any dig vot is possible or im-&#xD;
, possible, Mister Kurnel Villett !' .moaned the&#xD;
poor fellow.&#xD;
"Will you go, after I have had your clothes&#xD;
fixed for it, and alarm the Indians and all the&#xD;
camp of St. Leger with the idea that General&#xD;
Arnold is close at hand, andi will attack and&#xD;
eut theme to pieces in a few hours with an in-&#xD;
mense army?  Tell them you escaped while&#xD;
you were heing led to execution ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Nister Kurnel Villett, I vill do dat,&#xD;
und scare dem all same as one flock of sheep. "&#xD;
"how can I trust you ?"&#xD;
Both the mother and brother instantly&#xD;
offered to become security for the fattlhful per-&#xD;
forrmance of the promise, and lion Yost was&#xD;
solemnly assured that they would be hung if&#xD;
lie failed, and hlie meet the same fate if ever he&#xD;
was eaurht. lie again rene ved the promise.&#xD;
saw them bound as he had been, and then,&#xD;
after his clothes had been perforated in seve-&#xD;
pal places with bullets, end his hat alo, as&#xD;

allowed to depart. T'a result of the plan&#xD;

It is night-we are in the mitt cf the im-&#xD;
mense Indian encampment of the beleaguering&#xD;
force around Fort Schuyler. Why do we see&#xD;

&#xD;
these hundreds of Indians gailu'ved in silence&#xD;
around this one wigwam, from which lproceedE&#xD;
the monotonous tun, turn, turn, of the liden&#xD;
drum, and a low tong to the Manitou,or Greal&#xD;
Spirit? Iissatisfied with the result of the-dem&#xD;
feat at Oriskany, miournin over the loss of so&#xD;
ninn of their chiefs aid braves, and angry,&#xD;
too, at the deceits put upon them by the Brz&#xD;
ish leaders, the Indians are holding a solend&#xD;
pow-wow to ask the Manitou, through one off&#xD;
their prophets, if they shall hot abandon the&#xD;
expedition, and return home.&#xD;
And not alone are they discontented. Theei&#xD;
pale-faced allies, especially the Causdians all&#xD;
Hessians, who, unlike the stories, had no hate ta&#xD;
influence them, but fought for ten cents a day&#xD;
were sickened with the toils of a siege, so far&#xD;
only a losing game on their.part. Andeven the&#xD;
leaders ha  passed high words. Sir John&#xD;
Johnson and Barry St. Leger, each probably&#xD;
jealous of the other, had fallen out. But togo&#xD;
back to the pow-wow.&#xD;
Except the sound of tlje prophet's drum in-&#xD;
side the sacred wiigwam  reeted for the ocea-&#xD;
sion, all was still in that vast assemblage.&#xD;
Each moment they expected to hear the Mai'&#xD;
ton, to whom 'their prophet was prayi ,&#xD;
speak through his lips:&#xD;
But something comes to-break the stillness&#xD;
A man, with rent garments, pallid and terror-&#xD;
stricken face, sweating and gasping from fa-&#xD;
tigue, rushes in among them.&#xD;
It is Hon Yost, whom they all know an1&#xD;
hold;in awe, for they deem him one whose&#xD;
brain has been touched by tlhe finger of the&#xD;
Great Spirit. lie fearsf'not, heeds 'not the&#xD;
pow-wow-he tells them the fate he has e-&#xD;
caped-that an army is close at hand, which&#xD;
will sweep themdway as.the gale bears off the&#xD;
dry leaves in autumn ! 'rhey ask him, ho#&#xD;
many .-he points to the trees of the forest, anI&#xD;
says, "More yet than they."&#xD;
hark ! How the pow-wow prophet comes&#xD;
sweating and steaming from his lodge. Ihi&amp;amp;&#xD;
face, too, wears a look of mystery. Through&#xD;
him the Manitou is to speak.&#xD;
"The Great Spirit, is angry with a! W&#xD;
must go home and give feast to 4A in our owl&#xD;
villages !"&#xD;
The Manitou had spoken-no need for i me&#xD;
other words from Ion Yost there.&#xD;
Generals St. Leger and Johnson soon off&#xD;
served the general stampede which the Indiani&#xD;
are making, and hear the rumors which,&#xD;
through lion Yost and the Indians, are flying&#xD;
through the English camp.&#xD;
ion Yost is sent for into their presence.&#xD;
"What means this, ydu dog of a spy, this&#xD;
report that the American army is so close at&#xD;
hand ?" cried St. Leger, livid with rage ; for,&#xD;
almost sure of the surrender of the fort by&#xD;
morning, he was maddened at the thought '.&#xD;
a failure which would tear to pieces theisnure&#xD;
wreath, which he believed to be already e y&#xD;
twined for his brow.&#xD;

"The rain will do the'flower good," he said,&#xD;
tenderly, 'and lie did not offer'to remove her&#xD;

With a look of the bitterest anger, Dyagetto&#xD;
regarded the scene for a moment, and then she&#xD;
said, in the Indian tongue, which she knew&#xD;
Kathleen did not understand :&#xD;
'"A snake is upony our breast ! Cast it off!"&#xD;
-t is a dove, and I will protect it !" replied&#xD;
Thayeinlanegea, in the same language.&#xD;
"I will be the eagle to tear thy dove asun-&#xD;
der," said the mother, bitterly.&#xD;
"You may talk, you are my mother," said&#xD;
Thayendanegea, quietly,&#xD;
Niscayuna now returned perfectly calm, and&#xD;
Kathleen, having wept away her first burst of&#xD;
feeling, modestly, and with blushes upon her&#xD;
soft cheek, withdrew her white arms from the&#xD;
War-Eagle's neck, and sat down on the moss&#xD;
by his side. liut she no longer looked sorrow-&#xD;
ful. 11er face was radiant with the beauty of&#xD;
joy.                               .,&#xD;
"Niscayuna, how do you lile my sister?-&#xD;

"I like the Lify of the Pale-faces," said Nis-&#xD;
cavuna. "She is more beautiful than the stars&#xD;
at'night, or the flowers which follow the going&#xD;
off of the snow&#xD;
Kathleen looked up at Niseayuna as lie stood&#xD;
before her and said this, but a slight shudder&#xD;
passed through her frame, and she dropped her&#xD;
glance, for his eyes seemed to pierce her, and&#xD;
she felt an unknown fear of him-felt that lie&#xD;
was her enemy. And she clung closer to Thay-&#xD;
endanegea, as if she felt, dove as she was, she&#xD;
could say to the great War-Eagle: t" I dare&#xD;
trust thee !"&#xD;
"When do we go upon the war-path again,&#xD;
my Brother ?" asked Niseayuna, whose keen&#xD;
.    eye had' noticed that averted look, and even&#xD;
that slight shudder.&#xD;
" Soon--we must not be idle while the ene-&#xD;
mies of King George are so busy," said Thay-&#xD;
endanegea ; and then, when Kathleen clung to&#xD;
him and looked up imploringly in his face, he&#xD;
read her thoughts in her looks, and said :&#xD;
"Do not tremble, my dove, no harm shall&#xD;
come to the Lily, and when this war is over,&#xD;
there shall be flowers for you to walk upon !"&#xD;
-"1 do not fear for m-self. but for yon !"&#xD;
she said, softly. "If I die-it is'hut a drop&#xD;
falling into the sea, but if you were to die-I&#xD;
-I-" she could not finish the sentence in-.&#xD;
tended, but lnirst into a flood of tears again,;&#xD;
and once more his bosom was a resting-place&#xD;
for her heal.&#xD;
While Thavendanegea was engaged in sooth-&#xD;
ing this new'burst of grief, with a tenderness&#xD;
unusual to his stern nature, and new indeed to&#xD;
himself, Dvagetto caught the glance of Nis-&#xD;
cayuna, and with a look, called him to follow&#xD;
her. Whither they went, or what they paid,&#xD;
being to me a mystery, must remain so to the&#xD;
reader.&#xD;
&#xD;
"If yon will go again, oh, takie me' with yoi&#xD;
I can bear fItigue. I fear no danger, only let&#xD;
nm live and die by your side !" murmtfed&#xD;
poor Kathleen, when she became more corn&#xD;
posed.&#xD;
"Sweet dove, it cannot be. Thay-endanegea&#xD;
could not fight with one eye and all his heart&#xD;
upon you. lit his eye looks upon your ter.&#xD;
ro, and now he knows its cause. You shall&#xD;
no longer be left alone with her who would not&#xD;
have me wed a pal-face. I will place a guard&#xD;
of braves around you, who with their lives&#xD;
shall answer for the safety of the dove that&#xD;
has built her, iest in my heart ! And when&#xD;
again I come back, I will take the dove to i&#xD;
bosom, and it shall rest there forever I"&#xD;
And probably for the first time in his life,&#xD;
did the lips of Thayendanegba touch those of&#xD;
woman,'for now he bent his noble head down&#xD;
and pressed his lips to hers.&#xD;
She wept no more. A lofty feeling seemed&#xD;
to enter her heart. She said, and she looked up&#xD;
proudly : "lam the betrothed wife of Thayen.&#xD;
danegea ; I will be strong, and fit myself to ba4&#xD;
warrior's wife !"&#xD;
"The Great Spirit tells me that you will&#xD;
Be strong, and Thayendanegea will not be so&#xD;
careless of a life which inow belongs to the&#xD;
dove of his bosom !"&#xD;
Once more he kissed her, and then they&#xD;
arose and walked toward the wigwam. They&#xD;
had but just passed out of sight of thespot&#xD;
where they had been seated, when Dyagetto&#xD;
and Niscaynna stepped from a covert neat&#xD;
enough for them to have seen and heard all&#xD;
that had passed. They made no reinarks, but&#xD;
by different routes followed Thayendanegea&#xD;
slowly to the wigwam.&#xD;
CIIAPTER XLIII.&#xD;
Another wild forest scene, and once more&#xD;
we are among old acquaintances. Upon tie&#xD;
banks of the swift Tioga, amid a forest of the&#xD;
loftiest hemlocks, was formed an encampmen,&#xD;
mnch such as we have described before, whea'&#xD;
the ill-fated IIerkiner met Thayendanegea at&#xD;
Unadilla. IHere, as there, more than an hun-&#xD;
dred cheerful fires blazed up in the gloom of&#xD;
the night-here, as there, five hundred red&#xD;
warriors moved about them, roasted their beef&#xD;
or their venison ; but there was now a greater&#xD;
show, for this was Thayendanegen's great war-&#xD;
party returning from a sweep through a vast.&#xD;
portion of the country east and south, where&#xD;
he had gone almost at will, subsisting his men,&#xD;
of course, upon the phmnder of those whom he&#xD;
deemed to be his fors ; yet more merciful than&#xD;
Ibritish or tories, slaying none but those whom&#xD;
he met in arms against him. Tents, provisions,&#xD;
stores of various kinds wise plenty, and also&#xD;
horses to carry them. And this was his choedi&#xD;
band of braves, the veterans of the war, i a&#xD;
"old guard" of the Napoleon of the forest.&#xD;

Thayendanegen uttered these words with a&#xD;

no pe'1ec fully delineate.&#xD;
"My tops are beyond your line of senti-&#xD;

Thayednuegea made no reply, but gave an&#xD;

dispersed to their dil'erent camp-fires, to seek&#xD;
the repose from which they had been aroused,&#xD;
while 'T bayendanegea cast himself down upon&#xD;

don-t, I'll lend you a savage to show you i"&#xD;
Butler knew his man too well to trifle with&#xD;
him -further, and he departed with his suite&#xD;
-or all but one, and he wore no uniform.&#xD;
lie remained standing a moment in the&#xD;
shade of thet tent, until Butler and his party&#xD;
were out of hearing, and then stepped for-&#xD;
ward.-&#xD;
- " Creat Mister Var-Eagle, blease for let&#xD;

"Yes; you are a rascal, but too good for&#xD;
his company. There is meat, eat. There is&#xD;
a blanket, take it and sleep !" was the brief,&#xD;
but to the =poor Dutchman most satisfactory&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
Thayendanegea now spoke a word to Nis-&#xD;
caynna, who brought him a blanket, which he&#xD;
wrapped around his form, and scorning the&#xD;
shelter of a tent, raised more for form than&#xD;
necessity, in such weather, lay down to sleep.&#xD;

with his rile beneath his head, he went also&#xD;
to sheep.      -         -    -&#xD;

for a week, picked a blanket from a pile, to&#xD;

suit.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIV.&#xD;
One night more, and another camp. Who&#xD;
would believe it? the united forces t' Butler&#xD;
and 'TChayendanegea, of which, by his British&#xD;
commission, the former is in command, are&#xD;
encamped upon a lofty hill, evergreen covered,&#xD;
within one mile of the village and fort which&#xD;
they intend to attack. And this, although&#xD;
the colonel in command, Alden, has been in-&#xD;
formed of the intended attack. But, like&#xD;
Braddock in the French war, aid. still later,&#xD;
my poor friend .Dade, in the Florida war, ho&#xD;
held Indin cnning as well as courage at too&#xD;
light a weight, and was sunk by it in conse-&#xD;
quenee.&#xD;
And here, too, guided by the knowledge and&#xD;
skill of Thayendanegea, they had been led, in&#xD;
broad daylight; so that before they hid down&#xD;
in their blankets for the night-as they did&#xD;
without fires-they could count the soldiers in&#xD;
the garrison, see every house in the 'village,&#xD;
and even notice every spot where a sentinel&#xD;
was posted.&#xD;
That might,-before he made dispositions in&#xD;
regard to-his own movements in the morning&#xD;
(and history proves it), Thiayendanggea, much&#xD;
as he hated Butler, held an interview with him&#xD;
in regard to the sparing of fanniies in the&#xD;
place -telling him that friends of General&#xD;
Johnson and his own fattier dwelt there.&#xD;
But I cannot pause. A painful task is be-&#xD;
fore me; and the sooner it is over, the better.&#xD;
Iaving marked the position of every senti-&#xD;
nel the night before-leaving Dutier tochoose&#xD;
his own point of attack--Thayendmmnegea, at&#xD;
or before dawn, while snow-lakes were falling&#xD;
thick and fast in the air, moved down the hill&#xD;
with his men. Butler' with his "1 Iaingers "--&#xD;
alias murderous tories-taking t heir route.&#xD;
But before they reached the vilinge, a set-&#xD;
tler, going in on horseback, crossed their path.&#xD;
lIe was fired upon; but, in te darkness and&#xD;
mist of the morning, he escaped. TIhe alarm&#xD;
was given-gunms tired ; and all was now ex-&#xD;
citement and confusion. Butler anl his han-&#xD;
gers, without oven approaching the garrison,&#xD;
sprung to a work of general desolation and&#xD;
carnage. Thayendanege&amp;amp;s heart, saviage (:') as&#xD;
it was, thrilled with horror when he found how&#xD;
he had been betrayed by the iend Butler.&#xD;
One of his chiefs lie sent to protect the vener-&#xD;
able minister of tme place - others he sent&#xD;
elsewhere ; but he hastened to one family, of&#xD;
which he had spoken particubirly to the hated&#xD;
tory. lie was too late when he arrived at the&#xD;
house of Judge Wells: the family were slain I&#xD;
Ihe hurried in pursuit of Butler, who, mad&#xD;
with excitement, sword inmhanl, was rushmig&#xD;
from house to house, killing and ordering to&#xD;
kill.&#xD;
lie found him in the act of causing a woma3&#xD;
and ehifd to be'slain in bed.&#xD;

enemies to the king! Go check your devils!-&#xD;
they are not mn n !"&#xD;
'fhius rebuked, Butler turned away-not in&#xD;
shame, for he had none ; and Thayendanegea&#xD;
went on, to save.&#xD;
From the moment the garrison was alarmed&#xD;
and the fort secured, he knew how useless it was&#xD;
to try its strength wlhout artillery. his wish&#xD;
was iunpossihIe; and now, sickened and dis-&#xD;
gusted, he regretted that even the oath, by&#xD;
which he held his commission in a cause&#xD;
which lie had been reared to believe right, had&#xD;
beeii kept-&#xD;

CIIAPTER XLV.&#xD;
Sill another camp-fire, and one more mel-&#xD;
ancholy than any yet ; it is at a half-day's&#xD;
marehfrom Ciecry Valley, toward Niagara,&#xD;
whither Thayenlanegea, with some imlporLanit&#xD;
prisoners-'eeded to effect "exchanges'-is&#xD;
bound.lMelancholy, because these poor pri-&#xD;
oners have been suddenly wrenched from their&#xD;
desolated homes ; some have left living rela-&#xD;
tives behind ; others have left those whom they&#xD;
best loved on earth, dead and stark upon the&#xD;
ground.&#xD;
The camp is in a beautiful and romantic&#xD;
spot-it is in a dense ravine, where a broad&#xD;
glale of autumn-dried grass spreads out a soft&#xD;
carpet for the fort. Through its centre, winds&#xD;
a rippling stream, on its *n  to the Susque-&#xD;
hanna.   Upon either hn , seemingly  all&#xD;
around, rise muountains,. crowned with ever-&#xD;
green, so steep that they almost seem to topple&#xD;
over the iama below.&#xD;
Here in this dul, hitherto so lone and still,&#xD;
where few human feet have ever trod, liut where&#xD;
the red leer has rejoiced to feel and play, rest&#xD;
all of Thavendanaegen 's band-for he has not&#xD;
lost a man--and their prisoners.&#xD;
Butler, with his tory iugers,.and a few mer-&#xD;
cenary Indians, with whom l'hayendanegea s&#xD;
band have no connection, have taken another&#xD;
route.&#xD;
Bold in his conscious strength and fearless&#xD;
nature, the W\ar-Eagle has caused his camp-&#xD;
tires to be lighted as usual ; for he knows that&#xD;
no force beh.id wil be strong enough to follow&#xD;
him and if thieydid, he would almost, or quit:.,&#xD;
rejoice at the ebaice of a fair i ght--so sickened&#xD;
and hisgusted was he at the butchery of the&#xD;
morning, so dissonant with his own character.&#xD;
It was after nil tie canip was still, and suh&#xD;
o. the lr:soners as would eat had been fed, tiat&#xD;
Tlaveninuiea went to his own camp-fire,&#xD;
where ll n Yost lay sleeping, and Niscayuna&#xD;
sat on witeh&#xD;
&#xD;
ie approached the fire, cast hini~&amp;amp;!f down&#xD;
on his blanket, and I sr a time remained in&#xD;
thought--sad thought, for more thun once a&#xD;
sigh rose from his breast. At last, he said :&#xD;
" Niscayuna, from the day we fought at&#xD;
Oriskanyuntil now, you have clung to me as&#xD;
the vine clings to the oak. You are my bro-&#xD;
ther. There is a stone in my heart to-night,&#xD;
and I cannot east it out. There is a cloud be-&#xD;
fore my eyes ; it is very dark, but in its centre,&#xD;
I see the Lily of the Pale-faces-the White,&#xD;
Dove of my bosom. The path of my feet is to&#xD;
Niagara, but my heart wants to walk to the&#xD;
wigwam on the Mohawk !"&#xD;
Niscayuna listened in silence--he did not&#xD;
even ruse his eyes from the ground, upon&#xD;
which he was gazing.&#xD;
"I must send a messenger to the White&#xD;
Dove-will my brother go to her ?" continued&#xD;
Tluayendatiegea.&#xD;
'fThe frame of Niscayuna shook as shakes the&#xD;
aspen leaf, when the winds are breathing&#xD;
quickly ; but lie made no reply.&#xD;
"The White Dove is in a net! She calls&#xD;
upon the Eagle to save her !" continued Thay.&#xD;
endanegen. And his strong frame shook with&#xD;
an agitation which it had never known be-&#xD;
fore.&#xD;
siMy brother only dreams a bad dream !"&#xD;
said \iscayuna, at last, in a low and tremulous&#xD;
voice. But yet he did not raise his eyes from&#xD;
the ground.&#xD;
It is no dream, for I cannot sleep !" said&#xD;
Thayendanegea. "Ther low voice moans in my&#xD;
ear all the time-the Dove calls 1or her Eagle,&#xD;
and says: Come to me, or I lerish !"&#xD;
" Mv brother's ears are filled with the sounds&#xD;
he heard this .morning-pf the doves which&#xD;
then were cruelly sent to the spirit-land !" con-&#xD;
tinued Niscavuna.&#xD;
" No-my heart bled for them; there is only&#xD;
one voice now in my heart-it is the voice of&#xD;
the Lily.' of the Pale-faces-of the Dove of my&#xD;
bosom! "&#xD;
" Let my brother, the Great War-Eagle be a&#xD;
man, and not weak, like a woman. Let him&#xD;
sleep, and rest will drive away bad thoughts !"&#xD;
" I will listen to the words of nv brother-I&#xD;
will try !" said 'i'hayendanegea. Al lie drew lis&#xD;
blanket around him, and covering his head,&#xD;
tried to sleep.&#xD;
And   iscayuna, upon'whose face an hun-&#xD;
dred thoughts seemed to be painting them-&#xD;
selves, as it below, iii his heart, many passions&#xD;
vre at war, looked at the form of the reclining&#xD;
warrior ; but he did not try to sleep. And at&#xD;
titans low murmurs would rise to his lips-the&#xD;
thought of his heart trymg to get out Iromn&#xD;
their prison.-&#xD;
" l)agetto,-has kept her pledge !" he mur-&#xD;
nired. "The War-Eagle never shall be wed-&#xD;
ed'to a cursed pale-face!"&#xD;
"Who spoke ?" cried Thayendanegea ; and&#xD;
he half arose from the ground.&#xD;
"Ihe wi+d was groaning imeong the caverns&#xD;
of the hills I" said  iscayuna. "All else is still,&#xD;
&#xD;
f&#xD;
&#xD;
but the singing of the water as it goes to dance&#xD;
with its sisters in the Crooked River !',&#xD;
"I cannot sleep-the. voice that is in my&#xD;
teart is too loud .'&#xD;
Ie rose, anl for a long time walked to and&#xD;
fro before the fire ; his agitation not decreasing&#xD;
in all this time, but rather becoming more&#xD;
violent. At last he addressed Niscayuna otee&#xD;
more&#xD;
" Will my brother be my messenger to the&#xD;
White-Dove. I dare no trust another. My&#xD;
brother loves me. lie has proved his love.&#xD;
I have proved it as the strong man proves the&#xD;
bow !   Will my brother go to the White&#xD;
Dove ?"&#xD;
"Will my brother let his memory go back&#xD;
to the night after the fight at Oriskany ?"&#xD;
asked Niscayuna.&#xD;
"I lose my eyes, and it flies back swiftly !"&#xD;
replied lhayemdanegen.&#xD;
"Then itsees the hour when the Great War-&#xD;
Eagle bade Niscayuna call him brother before&#xD;
all the Nations l" continued IN iseayuna.&#xD;
"it looks upon that hour, and the eye is not&#xD;
dim which sees it," said Thayendanegea.&#xD;
"Has that memory an ear, as well as an&#xD;
eye ?" continued Niseayuna.&#xD;
" Only one ear : so that which goes in at the&#xD;
one, has no other to flee out of."&#xD;
"Then it hears Thayendanegea swear by the&#xD;
Great Spirit, that 1iscayuna shall nevcr be&#xD;
driven from his side !" cried the young war-&#xD;
rior ; and a look of triumph sat upon .his&#xD;
features.&#xD;
"it hears the oath, and Thayendanegea will&#xD;
not break it !" said the warrior; but there was&#xD;
a deep sadness in his tone. -&#xD;
lie spoke no more ; but sat all the night&#xD;
long by the fire, evidently revolving some&#xD;
lplas in Isis mind ; for the great veims is is&#xD;
temples were failing and rising, as if fhse&#xD;
thoughts were coming and going from the&#xD;
heart-to the'brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
It wus morning. The war-party was afoot&#xD;
while yet the gray dawn hung upon the&#xD;
track  of departing  night. The   morning&#xD;
food was cooked and eaten; the prisoners pre-&#xD;
pared for the days journey ; and all was ready&#xD;
or departure.&#xD;
Then Thayendanegea called his sub-chiefs to&#xD;
him, and upon a piece of white'bark he&#xD;
marked out for them their course, and the dis-&#xD;
.ance they must make upon each day's jour-&#xD;
Icy. This done, he told them to go on, and he&#xD;
;vould overtake them upon the route. IIe had&#xD;
another work to do, and must go and do it.&#xD;
The bird with its sorrowing train moved&#xD;
on, and hut three remained : Thayendanegea,&#xD;
Nisca vuna, and IIon Yost.&#xD;
"Why do you not go with them ?" asked&#xD;
Thaayenlanegea, sternly, of lion Yost ; and he&#xD;
pointed to the departing party.&#xD;
The name Susquehanna, in the Indian language,&#xD;
Mans thme Crooed &amp;amp;rssr.-&#xD;

&#xD;
"I have had a tream ;, and must go na rder&#xD;
Xar-Eagle to der Aloawks ' said hion Yost,&#xD;
quietly.&#xD;
uie Greit Spirit has spoken-who else&#xD;
could have told him  where TIhayendanegea&#xD;
was gedng'?" muttered the chief to hiniself&#xD;
Ties i-e added aloud:- " You shall go I hasten&#xD;
to cook food. We sleep not-pause not-till&#xD;
we get to the Mohaw.k!I"&#xD;
Niseayua said nothing; but if the chief-&#xD;
taitis heart had seemed very heav ythme night&#xD;
before,hi heart seemed i tnsmes hiehvier o1.&#xD;
On the contrary, new life seemed to have&#xD;
come back to the spirit of 'rliavetidanegea&#xD;
from the moment that he had forced his do-&#xD;
termination.&#xD;
"          CHAPTER XLVI.&#xD;
Before the new and elegant wigwam which&#xD;
Thayendanegea had caused to be built for&#xD;
Kathleen, before he last went upon the wvar-&#xD;
p)ath, were gathered the Indians whom he had&#xD;
left to guard her with their hives. Upo their&#xD;
faces, both grief and surprise vere visible; for&#xD;
their young queen, as they had lea ined to re-&#xD;
gtrd her, was nowhere to be found. Sihe had&#xD;
won upon their respect and love, by dressing&#xD;
as the Indian mnaidetns dressed ; ana her new&#xD;
hopes had so improved her looks, that r. her&#xD;
new garb she was wondrously eae f.d, and&#xD;
seemed more to them like an aigel f '"m the&#xD;
spirit-Lmnd than a being of niortal me ord. Iet&#xD;
eye expressing but a wish, it was ace :oplislied,&#xD;
'l he choicest game from the forest, the finest&#xD;
fish fr-om the waters, the swctst b irds that&#xD;
beat the air with feathery iiion-all were&#xD;
laid before her. She wished to make a gala&#xD;
suit of clothing for Thayendategea, to show&#xD;
him on his return that site could do as hIdian&#xD;
maidens did.   They taught her how, and&#xD;
brought her the materials; for Dyagetto, who&#xD;
remained spitefully in her old wigwan, would&#xD;
show lies-nothing.&#xD;
Mute atid sorrow-stricken, they stood before&#xD;
the wigwam ; for this was the second . day since&#xD;
she had been missed, and far and wide had they&#xD;
sought for her, arqd found no sign. Whe' they&#xD;
had asked Dya retto about her, she b ghed&#xD;
scornfally, and  id :&#xD;
" I suppose you slept upon your goril, and'&#xD;
she stole away from you. The pal Bees are&#xD;
treacherous, and do not like the re n!"&#xD;
But- these warriors knew hio diShe loved&#xD;
Thayendanegea, and how she tre.1 ad in them;&#xD;
for she never would move fl-rA the wigwam&#xD;
except when they went to g   i 'her. Some&#xD;
suggested thit she had b ec  Efted up to the&#xD;
spirit-land; but all shook te, heads, an mur-&#xD;
mured -&#xD;
" What wi.'l Thaijendane te' say ?"&#xD;
While thus standing, a distant and a cheer-&#xD;
ful cry was heard. Oh, boa well they knew&#xD;
that shout i It was the "return call" of Thay-&#xD;
endan" ge" .&#xD;
They stood still, looked one at time other,&#xD;

for she hid heard the far-oif cry, and with a&#xD;
singular E:iie upoli her face, she caine to wel-&#xD;
tome her toin to his wigwam.&#xD;
Soon he eame bounding on, as light as a&#xD;
buck. which, when the morning air is fresh,&#xD;
hears the hottne13 afar off, anl despising them,&#xD;
sprigs the earth beneath his feet. In a moment&#xD;
he was at the wigwam-door, beside which hung&#xD;
the beatiful dress which she had made for&#xD;
him. Ils eve rested uon it a pleased second&#xD;
--he .n n w i was her wor k-then supposing ihat&#xD;

lace of the \Var-Eagte as he neared the nest&#xD;
where he hai1 h ft his flower.&#xD;
lpyng tto and Niseayuna exchanged one look&#xD;
of intel ligence, and then seemed no more to see&#xD;
or know ci other.&#xD;
In a Fomenit, Thayendanegea re-appeared,&#xD;
wonder upjons face, but as yet no other ex-&#xD;
pressio1.&#xD;
'    rWhi ne is my White-Dove?  Where is the&#xD;
Lily of V heart ?  Does she hide from Thay-&#xD;
endang":i, that she maytense him ?"&#xD;
No rpv ws made but by looks.   lie saw&#xD;
that s: thn     was wrong, and his face&#xD;
changed like the sun when a cloud sweeps&#xD;
acro  it.&#xD;
" e is the Lily ?" he thundered.&#xD;
The wariirs trenibled ; but not one of them&#xD;
dared be die irat to speak. But Dyagetto, in&#xD;
a sarca-t a,: tome, sai:&#xD;
"A hi:-d told me, that while your warriors&#xD;
slept, ie stole away, to find a pale-faced&#xD;
lover."&#xD;
"Wionim, you lie! The bird that threat-&#xD;
ened to tear myc dove to pieces is the only bird&#xD;

thumlernl Tlhiyenlanegea ; and with every&#xD;
vein swclbrn- as if it would burst, his form&#xD;
distemino  as if he was about to spring upon&#xD;
her, he awaited her answer.&#xD;
"Ask th r-von left her with them !" she&#xD;
said, and 1ojitel to the guard.&#xD;
For an mitiat, mastering lis passion with a&#xD;
m:ghty eurt, the chief turned to them, and&#xD;
asked ini expilin:tion of the manner of her dis-&#xD;
jparnie.&#xD;
'Ilie on whom lie haid placed as captain over&#xD;
all ti he r  inow told 'lhavemanegen all about&#xD;

how she ha i waited the return of the War-&#xD;

as usual ;ibt a &amp;amp;n range drowsiness came over&#xD;
thiem-thi sie1pt without the power to avoid&#xD;
at; an.d when morning came, she was gone.&#xD;
Calnn y, to a; pe:rance, Thayeudamteg' a heard&#xD;
all this ; -bit wh ihe warrior had finished, it&#xD;
.ouid be seen that the most fearful storm of&#xD;
&#xD;
lis terrible nature was rising: and wo to that&#xD;
one on whom its lightnings fill&#xD;
lint now lion Y8st. whose evs, from the&#xD;
beginniiing, had been wandering frem Dyngetto&#xD;
to ieeavni. touched Thayemulanegeni upon the&#xD;
arm, and sud&#xD;
"One 1ird tells me sometings too, Mister&#xD;
Var-Eagle. Come mit inc. lion Yost tream&#xD;
dat lie finds yoir Lily !"&#xD;
'alnilanegea looked at lion Yost a mo-&#xD;
ment as if he would read hini through ; then&#xD;
said:  .    ,,&#xD;
" I will go !"&#xD;
Ion Yost led the way, at once, to a path&#xD;
which wound along a ravine down to the small&#xD;
level upon the bank of the foaming river, lie&#xD;
was followed closely by 'hayenianegea; next&#xD;
by the warriors ; and last of all caine Dy a-&#xD;
getto and  iscaynai.in.&#xD;
Without a moment's hesitation or faltering,&#xD;
lIon Yost led the way to the same ravine&#xD;
where, in times long back, we traced the&#xD;
Wicked Aroghiyadecka ; and paused not until&#xD;
he reached the very spot where, [or years, the&#xD;
noble Ogahtee had suffered. l'ushmg aside&#xD;
the small stone in the mouth of the cave, he&#xD;
said :&#xD;
"Call to your gird, Var-Eagle. I dinks&#xD;
you find her here !"&#xD;
" I this care ?" asked Thavendanegea.&#xD;
lie needed no other call. his voice had&#xD;
heen heard ; for a clear, sweet cry came up&#xD;
from the gloom below :&#xD;
" 'Fitnycndancgea-'linAYEmDNEr.A I Ihbnew&#xD;
you would come -"&#xD;
It was Kathleen!&#xD;
With a cry of mixed anger and delight,&#xD;
'Ia vendhanegen would have tried to force his&#xD;
way through the narrow aperture; but Ilon&#xD;
Yost restrained him, and only said&#xD;
" Come mit me-comeinut roe. Var-Eagle!"&#xD;
Ie then leaped around the ngmle of the rock'&#xD;
to a spot whre only two could stand. From&#xD;
a ledge overheard, placed where no one would&#xD;
see it liut one who knew it was there, he drew&#xD;
n stout lever of wood. lie insertel this be-&#xD;
hind, or in ihe crevice of what nppeiared to be&#xD;
an imninensie rock. With but very little effort,'&#xD;
it yielded to the leverage ; and opening,&#xD;
showed that it was. but a door to the cavern,&#xD;
but si constructed that it could not be opened&#xD;
from the inside.&#xD;
"Call your pird, Var-Engle .' sid lion&#xD;
Yost, proudly ; for he had now won a victory&#xD;
to him greater than that at Fort Sehuiyler.&#xD;
No need, even now, had Thmny-ulnmegea to&#xD;
call her; for Kathleen hailseen the light-had&#xD;
rcotgnired his form ; and now, with a delirious&#xD;
shrwik of pleasure - of joy unutteraile by&#xD;
1wrds-she sprunmg from  the gloom unto lue&#xD;
outstretched arms.&#xD;
A nd then the warrior, to whom Death was&#xD;
but a plavmalte-whose heart was supposed to&#xD;
be ha rdhen, a thousand t.mes, than the linit in&#xD;
his gun-knelt down ; and while he kissed hey&#xD;
again and again, wept like a very child-wept&#xD;
&#xD;
TIDE WAR-EAGLE OF TIIE MOIIAWKS.&#xD;
&#xD;
and sobbed until she tried to dry his tears with&#xD;
ier many kisses, and almost chidingly asked&#xD;
if he was not glad to see lier.&#xD;
" Oh, so glad---so glad-nmy heart will break&#xD;
out from my breast!I-it is too big!--let the&#xD;
water run from it" he said, in \ones so low&#xD;
and soft you could not have believed that they&#xD;
came from a warrior's tongue.&#xD;
In a little while, he was more calm; and&#xD;
holding her in his arms, he followed lon Yost,&#xD;
who-with a delicacy which men accredited of&#xD;
sense might not have exhibited-had gone on,&#xD;
and permitted that noble burst of feeling in'a&#xD;
biave heart to go unwitnessed.&#xD;
When Thayendanegea appeared to his de-&#xD;
lighted warriors with their loved young queen&#xD;
in his arms, they rent the air with their shouts&#xD;
of joy, and led the way out to the river-bank,&#xD;
where the glad sun was shining -makitig the&#xD;
river and the wild foaming cataract look like&#xD;
a mixed flood of silver and of gold.&#xD;
Dyagetto and Nisoayuna had disappeared ;&#xD;
but, in the general joy, no one seemed to no-&#xD;
tice or think of that. Once upon the firm&#xD;
shore, Thayendanegen released his precious&#xD;
burden from his arms ; and putting her down,&#xD;
stood and'}looked at her, in her beautiful&#xD;
forest garb, and in the renewed loveliness&#xD;
which love and hope had given her, with the&#xD;
same intense admiration which some soul-&#xD;
enwrapped artist bestows upon a work just&#xD;
finished - which, for him, has been the toil,&#xD;
the study, the sole ideal for years upon&#xD;
years.&#xD;
Amid then, all heedless-of the presence of his&#xD;
warriors, he caught her up to his breast, and&#xD;
kissed her again and again, until, in a whisper,&#xD;
she reminded him that they were not alone,&#xD;
while she blushed a treble beauty at the&#xD;
thought.&#xD;
"True, my own one !" he said, gently.&#xD;
Then, turning to his warriors, he bade them&#xD;
go up to the wi wam and prepare a feast, while&#xD;
he and the Whnte-Dove walked by the water-&#xD;
side and talked.&#xD;
All obedient, and now doubly swift for the&#xD;
happiness which they felt, they hurried to do&#xD;
so, while Thayendanegea, as he became more&#xD;
calm, clasping the hand of his loved Kathleen,'&#xD;
walked up along the brink of the foaming tor-&#xD;
rent, and sought to so still his emotions that&#xD;
he could ask her how she was placed in the&#xD;
cave-for he feared his own anger, and Wtished&#xD;
to master it while he could. -&#xD;
.Reachinu a spot just above the cataract,&#xD;
that where first he nad landed with her, he&#xD;
sat down upon a log close by the fringe of&#xD;
bushes at the foot of the clill, and directly&#xD;
beneath that lofty look-out, where she had&#xD;
stood so many patient hours watching for him,&#xD;
and placed her by his side.&#xD;
Now more calm, he asked hr the questions&#xD;
which he wished. And she told him a long&#xD;
&#xD;
77&#xD;
&#xD;
tale of the ill-treatment which she had received&#xD;
before lie placed a guard to protect her, and&#xD;
then how Dy agetto had ii vain tried to gel&#xD;
the guard to destroy her; -,and how, at last,&#xD;
after she had- retire to her rest, feding very&#xD;
sleepy after she had supped, she awoke in the&#xD;
cave, and heard the taunting voice of Dyagetto&#xD;
cry:&#xD;
"My son shall never wed a-pale-face! You&#xD;
shall dse !"&#xD;
A warning cry was heard from the crest of&#xD;
the cliff at this instant ; but, U  God of&#xD;
Heaven! it was all too late to save ; for as&#xD;
Thayendanegea started   at the sound, his&#xD;
mother, leaping like a tigress from the covert&#xD;
close behind, sprung upon poor kathlneen&#xD;
seized her in her arms, and at a single bouni&#xD;
was buried in the rushing waters !  or a mi&#xD;
ment paralyzed, Thayendanegea stood, and&#xD;
then would have leaped after those who were&#xD;
now buried far amid the rocks below, hiad not&#xD;
Niscayuna caught and held him back-or tried&#xD;
to do so, for the chief struggled terribly. In&#xD;
the struggle he would have succeeded, had not&#xD;
some of the warriors from above, who had ut-&#xD;
tered the warning-cry, reached them just as&#xD;
both were on the water's brink, and drew&#xD;
them back.&#xD;
And now the garments, rent from the boson&#xD;
of Niscavuna, disclosed the fact that a woman&#xD;
stood before them !&#xD;
Thayendanegea, faint from exertion and ex-&#xD;
citement, gazed one moment, and uttered the&#xD;
name :&#xD;
"IONA!"&#xD;
With beaded head, and blushes darkening&#xD;
her face, she drew the rent galrments over her&#xD;
bosom, and threw herself weeiiig and terra&#xD;
fled at his feet ; for in his look she read that h&#xD;
had in a moment divined her agency in this&#xD;
matter, and her motive for putting on male at-&#xD;
tire, and following him every where !&#xD;
With folded arms, he stood and grew calm,&#xD;
fearfully calm; for there is a cairn of determine&#xD;
action which is fearful! Iis warriors stood by&#xD;
in silence. They looked upon him, and did&#xD;
not dare to speak ! The scene was too full of&#xD;
suspense--it was maddening !&#xD;
At last she rose and looked at him--oh! s.&#xD;
h art-brokenly !       -&#xD;
"Go seek her you have torn from my bo.&#xD;
som I" he said, sternly.&#xD;
One look at him-one heavy sigh which told&#xD;
that her heart had burst-and she obeyed ! The&#xD;
dark waters closed over her, the white waters&#xD;
received her, and her spirit fld after those&#xD;
which had gone before !&#xD;
The Mohawk braves trembled and breathed&#xD;
quick breaths ; but Thnayendanegea, without a&#xD;
quiver on his lip, like a moving statue of&#xD;
bronze, turned and said, in a tone lioarse and&#xD;
deep, but strong :&#xD;
